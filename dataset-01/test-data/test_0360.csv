3,Insightful,"Makes you think. I like that it is able to put into words things that you have felt, but didn't know could be explained. I like the little stories that are given."
2,The book is about as good as the HTML Help Authoring Kit,"This book suffers from shortcomings, but to be fair, so does Microsoft's HTML Help SDK. The SDK suffers from a sloppy user interface, modal windows that should be modeless, some unbelievable bugs, etc., and you can see that it has made the book less useful than it could be.Specifically, the book is missing information that users of a reasonably well-debugged application should not need, such as a list of bugs, features never implemented, features that don't work correctly, etc.The other reviews for this book are on the money as to this book's problems. To learn to use HTML Help, I found this book useful, but you must supplement it with information that you can get from web sites that devote themselves to HTML Help issues. These sites point out the bugs and other issues that HTML Help authors absolutely need to know about."
3,A favorite group,"Well, it is like a stage play; or, I guess it -was- a stage play. Okay, but not my favorite. I kept expecting someone to go off to war.Damian does a very good job with his part, and Ryan Kelly is good,of course. The rest are okay too, except a bit awkward at times. These guys are singers, and darned good ones! I say let them sing.The fact is, I like them so much, I would probably get anything with them in it, -to a point. Ha! I give them credit for being good sports. Hmmm. Whose idea was this anyhow? If you must do it, maybe a bit more experience will help.In any event, I will watch it again; glad I have it; otherwise I would wonder why I did not. Not really excited about the girls twisting and flitting about either. (Memories of High School plays.) Sometimes it fits to have a girl in one of the songs, but sometimes it seems like, ""Let's try this."" Of course, in this one, girls were necessary, but...This is a sorry review, because I find myself struggling for words.Mickey Thorne"
1,5 Stars for the Compilation - 1 Star for Sound and Edition,"I bought this CD hoping to enjoy these songs in Hi-Fi quality. What a disappointment. I have rarely seen a poorest mixing/sond balance. Where is the power and strength, the drums and base line? Sound quality is absolutely lame. Flat and unsubstantial. As some reviewer pointed aout, the sound engineer should be fired. I bet an mp3 version sure sounds better. To add to this disappointment, the editing of songs like ""Sole Survivor"" and ""Here Comes The Feeling"", cutting down the track lenghts is unaceptable. Shouldn't a record company have some sort of quality control?"
3,Wetton is no Payne,"I enjoy the early Asia music, it is usually very good. But if you're a fan of current Asia with John Payne, be warned: he's not on here anywhere. This features Asia's original singer and bass player John Wetton, who was once in Uriah Heep. Wetton is pretty good, but nowhere near as strong or talented as Payne. So wait until you have all the real Asia cd's (Aqua, Aria, Arena, Archiva 1 & 2, Anthology, Live Acoustic and Rare) before picking this up. It's just so old sounding. And if it's just one Asia cd you want get Anthology. It is by far the better compilation since it has John Payne."

3,"Cinco estrellas por la novela, una por la traducción","Idoru es una de las mejores novelas de Gibson, junto con Luz Virtual y Todas las fiestas de mañana. Supongo que otros comentarios les aclararán más en este punto.Lo que quería decir se refiere a esta edición en particular, la traducción al castellano que hizo Manuel Figueroa. Y es que es DE LO PEOR.Está llena de errores, decisiones equivocadas, distracciones, ripios y otras ""delicias"" que la hacen muy difícil de leer.Una pena. Si pueden, leanla en idioma original. Y si no, protesten como yo."
4,Come On Mr. Curb,It's good to see these Greatest hits packages and the release of The Osmonds Country CD...but they had a lot of other great music out...One of the best things they did was there live around the world album... It not only features all of the brothers but also Marie as well. So Mr. Mike Curb instead of having your artists do a bunch of remakes how about releasing some of the originals for us True Osmond Fans.
2,Misleading!,"I was very disappointed that these were not the original recordings, as it is not identified on the CD that these are remakes. Donny's voice is noticably absent from 'One Bad Apple' (although he couldn't now possibly hit the high notes of his pre-pubescent years anyway, the bland non-Osmond chorus refrain that was inserted sounded quite fake). I doubt Donny Osmond was even involved with this project as a matter of fact. I find it interesting the complete lack of credits, liner notes, etc. other than the notation of Mike Curb."
4,Good to check your cats glucose in the litter box,"I bought this because my Vet said my Cat ispre-diabetic. He's on a low carb cat fooddiet, but I wanted to check his glucosewithout using an ear prick & monitor. Thepaper pieces show the amount of glucose inhis urine, so I was able to determine thathe's still ""pre-diabetic"" and not in needof insulin injections just yet. It's agood product to determine the level ofglucose in your cat, and the higher thelevel, the more you will need to visit yourVet to check for glucose levels and possiblyto begin insulin injections."
4,Sing Faster-the stagehands' ring cycle,well done! gives one a wonderful idea of what goes on behind the scenes and the speeded up ring cycle is a treat.
3,Good quality natural disaster movies,"Good quality but not epic, suspenseful with sufficient basis in real life to hold your attention for the whole movie."
3,You get what you pay for,"This my first purchase of this product I give it three stars because, my brother printer had these cartridges installed and did not receive any use for a month or so and when I want to print out a document I notice that the ink had dried and the nozzles. To fix the problem I had to use the clean option to re-prime, and clean the print heads, everything now is working great. I hope that I don't have to re-prime and clean every time I let my printer set unused for month.Just goes to show you you get what you pay for. The print quality good, very little streaking, and vivid colors. I would purchase these ink cartridges again."
1,Italy's Most Expensive with Kids,"I am sorry I bought this book. I was looking for information on fun things to do with kids in Italy. This book is more about travelling to fancy resorts and eating in fine restaurants while your kids tag along. I was turned off instantly when the book recommended bringing gameboys! The authors seemed more interested in shopping, sports cars and fine dining, than cultural or active pursuits tailored to families. The book is more of a hotel guide with average room prices of $300/night, and not a very good one at that. It is difficult to determine exactly where each recommended property is located. If you are travelling on any kind of budget, don't bother wasting any of it on this book."
1,Expensive Hotels in Italy,There are some really lovely hotels featured in this book that describes the hotel and the family's experience and encounters in each. I think that this family must have gotten complimentary rooms in exchange for promotion via this book and thus enjoyed their stays in some fine properties. I was looking more for ideas on traveling with kids in italy. Found more of that in the Italy Discovery Journal.
1,Useless,"Like everyone else has said, the book is essentially a guide to (some) expensive hotels in Italy. In addition it's poorly organized and gives almost no helpful or practical information at all: getting there? getting around? local info? an index? I can't imagine anyone who might find this book useful in any way, unless you've got scads of cash and can't find a better way of spending it. Silly me to think that ""the best of Italy"" might refer to something like its history, people, museums, food, literature, scenic walks. Evidently the best Italy has to offer this family are 4 and 5-star resorts that cater to your every ""need."" Very glad I got this one from the library before I bought..."
2,Bad Tech Support. Couldn't capture analog video,"I had high hopes for this capture card. It was under $100 and could capture both digital and analog video. Installation went fine. Digital capture went without a hitch. But it would not capture analog video (though either S-video or composite input). Software would shut down or give me an error message whenever I hit record. Although, interestingly enough, the image would preview on the screen, but wouldn't record. A couple of emails to tech support were of no help (""probably defective card. Return it""). I returned the card and got a new one. Same result. This time, emails to tech support weren't answered. I was hoping for some kind of suggestion, or a patch or any help. I tried uninstalling/re-installing, shutting off virus protection, etc. Although digital capture worked fine, 75% of my material was analog, so I ended up returning this one, too. Shame."
2,Turtle Beach ADX card,When I ordered the card it was on back order for two weeks. I was supposed to get free shipping which I didn't get. The card is supposed to have hardware DV to MPG2 on the fly conversion. It dropped too many frames. I thought the card would off load most of the work of the processor which apparently it does not. I have a 2200 Athlon which is above the minimum required. The only really good news is that Tiger cheerfully refunded the whole cost of the order including shipping.
2,Disappointing Book,"The title is misleading, there is a chapter that very briefly narrates what went on onboard the Maryland during the battle, but there is little else. While the discussion of the life on board the Maryland is interesting, there is little in the way of substance."
5,We love Mr. B!,"Mr. Bennett is my choir director at my school and he is amazing. He has taught me and my peers so much about music. His motto is ""If you love the music, the music will love you back."" And I know that he loves the music a LOT. This CD is awesome!!!"
5,Perfect Text and Reference for Chemists and Chem Students,"This is a very hard-core and detailed treatment of the subject of organic chemistry. Ideal for chemistry majors, this book has served as a refresher for me as a professional chemist. The book assumed mastery over general chemistry and the prerequisites of chemical structure and bonding. Practice problems are only to help develop further insight and application of the chemistry presented."
2,Did Not Like,"I did not like this DVD. I did not like the role that Sandra Bernhard played. Thought it was going to be a different kind of a flavor than what it was. It was more like a ""B"" class movie. I would not buy this DVD again.Jim"
1,AS BAD AS EVERYONE CLAIMS,"After a few meteors hit the earth a group of people decide to renew faith, meet with loved ones, or question faith as the end of the world doesn't seem to fit too well in God's plan. What this film does is combine the bad script, bad acting and bad soundtrack of a classic Asylum rip-off production with the confused dialouge and theology of Faith Film. CG flames.The movie is primarily a bad drama with a science fiction background.Meteors are part of the end world prophecy. The earth passes through a meteor belt every 2500-3000 years. In circa 2250 BCE the Great Famine was blamed by such meteor strikes, In Revelation it was believed such strikes would once again happen and usher in a new age beginning with a strike from ""Wormwood."" This didn't happen until about 500 AD and the hits the earth took was relatively minor. The next go around won't happen until about 3000 AD or so.I would recommend one avoid the film."
3,Good Beginner Video for Abs,I found this video helpful as a beginner. I did the first 6 minute segment until I could do it with ease. Then I added the second 6 minute segment and so on. This gave me a good foundation to then move on to a more advanced video.
3,Nice gloves but way too expensive,"I purchased these women gloves because my hands are pretty small for a man. If you were to search online for men gloves you will find that most if not all men's gloves are sizes large and above, therefore, I had to buy a pair of women's large gloves that looks o.k. on a man.My only quarrel is that these gloves are way too expensive for the make and overall style, but again, I didn't have many options available!"
5,Wilson A2800 first baseman's glove,"Great glove, good leather and fit. Purchased for son who plays in college. Had purchased this glove before and when he needed a new one went back to Wilson."
4,"Great Glove, Nice Leather","This is a fantastic 1st Basemen's mitt. The leather is prime so it takes awhile to break it in. Once it's broken in, its SWEET!"
4,Cold Cuisine is Cool,"These marvellous recipes have a literary quality, and range from a refreshing cucumber Vichyssoise through a rich, but delicious cold curried chicken to honeydew melon and honey ice.Interesting, doable recipes for you or for you and guests."
5,CHECK THIS GUY OUT!,"After reading the album liner notes, I see that MItch recorded and mixed this all by himself.. while I have to say that it lacks the polish of a big label production, he has certainly managed to get a lot of it right.. it sounds pretty good production wise.. I think the real strengths are in his songwriting and abilities as a guitarist.. I think some of his licks are smoking! All though the songs cover a full spectrum from pop to rock to blues and some reggae grooves - I personally liked the rock/reggae tunes.... similar in comparison to Steel Pulse or Steely Dan.. Later tracks he goes into some acoustic songs along the lines of James Taylor and David Wilcox - in fact he closes the album out with the only song he did not write - which is Leave It Like It Is - which was written by David WilcoxI ordered this CD without previously hearing it, and find it well worth the 16 bucks!"
1,"what crap, I think i see a cow","not only is this music terrible, but the people from hypnotix hype it up like you found some treasue of gold, maybe you should have included more downloadable content with your game instead of cheap music?"
3,"Not that sharp, crummy box.","The wood of the box is fine, but the liner is trashy plastic which will not let go of the knives, and makes the box more trouble than it is worth.Although the knife seemed sharp enough, it did not do a good job cutting through flank steak and pork roast. Once the knife had pierced the surface, it did well enough, but still was more work than expected. Several of my kitchen knives, both cheaper and more expensive (victorinox and shun) did a better job at carving than this carving dedicated knife. It may have to do with the rather wide angle of the knife compare to asian style blades and even some other german knives, as I feel this knife may be too strong for its own good. I replaced it with a much more expensive but much, much better Shun set.The handle also picked up grease residue that required significant scrubbing to get off."
4,Great book for the beginner.,I found this book extremely informative concerning the basics of Dutch Oven Cooking. I am just starting out and the information provided has been very beneficial. The author covers everything you need to know getting started. The recepies are very good as well. If you are starting out Dutch Oven cooking I would highly recommend this book.
2,Rusty knives...,Have had this cutlery 6 months now. I love the shape & style BUT as beforementioned all knives have got rusty. And ONLY the knives.It's really annoying as I could but a lot cheaper stuff elsewhere that will not rust. Bad quality...
1,Warning: Don't be tempted by the low price!,"I purchased a GoVideo DVD Recorder +VCR a mere seven months ago, and it worked fine for a while, but then the DVD drive simply died. I tried calling the so-called ""help line"" but was put on hold for over 45 minutes. I finally gave up and wrote an e-mail, but I received only FAQ answers in return (none of which addressed my problem). I finally decided to cut my losses and junk the machine. If you buy this piece of junk, don't expect it to last, and when it breaks, don't expect any support. Save your money and get a better product."
4,My Go Video Dvd Recorder,I had this dvd recorder now for about 3 yrs i think & i never had a problem yet as far as recording anyhting. That is recording dvd to vhs & vhs to dvd it works well actually great. Any movie that i burn from my computer the dvd player always plays it. When useing the dvd recorder especially when its vhs to dvd you must finalize it in order to get the disc to play in any other dvd player. As far as the options that i use from this dvd recoreder it has it works awesome & im completely happy with this product. The only reason i didn't give 5 stars cause i haven use every option yet. When i 1st got it i call customer service they were great they showed me the 1 touch quick operation as far as recording & i never had a problem since then
2,Wheels do not fit in,"the whole design of the product is acceptable. Cheap materials, but that is ok. However, the 4 wheels under the poles actually could not fit into the holes of the poles. The holes have 2 levels. When I put the wheels into the holes, it only fit into the first level. The wheels were not completely buried into the poles, so the wheels kept falling off. I so used the hammer to tap the wheels into holes. The wheels seems get further inside the holes but they broke the plastic covers of the holes. With the plastic broken, the poles were not strong enough to hold the wheels. So the wheels collapse. So I actually cannot use the wheels."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"This is terrible! The WHEELS broke and the hole to insert them, the moment my husband tried to put them in theholes, according to the directions. The canvas part is o.k, but I wanted theWHEELS in order to be able to move the carts around!!Didn't want to pay for the return shipping, so just kept them. They are on the floor, with NO WHEELS, so can't move them around, as that is why I made the purchase.This product is poorley made as far as the wheels are concerned, and that is thereason anyone buys these. There are meant to be moved around. NOT SO. Because theplastic wheels and other parts broke on just about all the 8 holes.GRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!Mrs. Elizabeth WhithamAshland, Ma."
1,Do not buy! Does not work properly!,"I bought this secondhand in the hopes I would be able to see my small GB SP screen better. I was wrong. It took a lot of struggle to get the magnifier on. Once on, it flopped back down uselessly, and there was no way to tighten it.Do not buy! It's a waste of money! :("
1,Stick with Epson,"My experience with Rhinotek B/W and color ink cartridges on an Epson PhotoEX (6-color inkjet printer) was a disaster. Clogged print heads are a major problem, especially with black, but also with color. I lost more time and money on wasted paper and ink (cleaning cycles) than I could have ever saved on this so-called cost-effective alternative. Going back to original Epson cartridges solved these problems immediately.Bottom line: Stick with Epson ink for optimal results and lowest cost per print."
1,Cashing in on the deaths of innocents,"I haven't seen this kind of spoon-feeding of beliefs since the propaganda movies of the Third Reich...or maybe Jerry Bruckheimer's Pearl Harbor. In trying to capture the pain felt by the American public, The Chefs have merely shown the a knee-jerk reaction that many of us felt, but were soon mature enough to realize not constructive in the slightest."
1,Awful Product,"Audio and video were out of synch. Couldn't use the Studio to import due to ""copyright protection"" even from my video camera on video that I taped. Had to use ADS to import and then you lose the automatic color correction.Files it creates are WAY to big. I returned it.Stay away...I am still looking."
1,To Many Problems,"This product has to many situations in which it would not work and not enough that would work. The tech support was all email. That is OK however, you try a fix and wait on the next email. I did not buy this product to have problems. I bought it to use. I returned it and used another product that worked out of the box."
1,Ad FullCap Needs a Serial # Not Supplied,"The capture software, Ad FullCap, requires a serial number different from the product ID # in order to open and run it. That number is not supplied in some packages, and you must e-mail tech support and wait for them to e-mail you back the number. Had there been any notice of this requirement, I would have e-mailed them before I wanted to capture video, instead of wasting the weekend I'd cleared to do the the project."
3,Well...It's better than Deities and Demigods...,"I found the book to have very useful information. It had many deities that I had not heard of before, and it also had states on alot of deities. The bad part about it is the Monster deities are thrown aside as if a campaign dealing with deities didn't need them at all. Another thing is when it gets deeper into the diffrent humanoid pantheons, it gets a little vague, and it doesn't have there stats ethier. But lets try to ignore the bad parts. It is very very useful when running a 'normal campaign', with the same old 'human priest, gnome priest' thing. It also gives some deity based prestige classes and it also gives a couple major worship sites. I would suggest this book OVER Deities and Demigods, which gives fewer AD&D deities and more Olympion and other lost religion's deities."
5,Asian Blossoms,I really like this CD.I do Reflexology and Reikiand find the music very suitable for a relaxingtype of atmosphere.
5,The gentle healing touch,"The Ultimate Reiki Touch is a moving and inspiring work that explains the essence of Reiki which is the Usui method of natural healing. Reiki is a healing modality in which the healer transfers universal energy to the patient through the laying on of hands on specific chakra points.Suitable for both the newcomer and the established practitioner, the book is an excellent practical guide that explains the power and application of universal life force energy. It deals with Reiki as a gentle healing art and as a way of life based on love.The book also provides the healer with multiple ways in which to become more receptive for the compassion and healing force that is the essence of Reiki. The author writes with great insight and skill. Her techniques are easy to understand and apply. The Ultimate Healing Touch is one of the very best works available on this simple but effective healing modality."
5,An extraordinary gift book,"I first picked up C.S. Lewis's Screwtape Letters nearly 50 years ago as a university student and read many of his books since--and have given away dozens. But C. S. Lewis: A Celebration of His Early Life is an equisite visit with a child who became a man of towering stature in Christian literature. The packaging, the graphic design, the many pictures I've never seen before, the artwork done especially for this book, the pictures taken in Ireland and England, all enhance the wonderful reading experience. The letters, the description of hijinks, the portrayal of a difficult period at school in England, the family relationships, all contribute to an understanding of an amazing man. As you see the boy become a man, are exposed to the literary influences on his life, you begin to see what shaped both character and interests. Reading this equisite gift book was as much an aesthetic experience as a reading experience."
1,"Boring, slow and dirty",I regret watching this movie. The whole movie is disgusting and depressing. The theme is very weak.
4,Wonderful,"I would like obtain Jane Fonda Lean Routine. I have now Low Impact and Workout Step Aerobic. I Like very much that videos. Videos are wonderful. Vivean Recio vrecio@uccaribe.edu 1-787-786-2029 8Th. Street, I-2 Vista bella, Bayamon, P.R. 00956"
5,The best aerobics tape I've tried!,"I've been using this one for about 6 years off and on. It's the only tape I've seen that I could stand for that long. The workout can be modified to be harder or easier with wrist and ankle weights, and the fun routine and personal interplay on the tape help it go quickly."
5,Puts time back into joint,"I only acquired this book in the later stages of my parents' divorce -- which began in 2000 but lasted for hard 3 years of back-and-forth --- but it made a tremendous difference in how I thought about and understood it, as well as my own more extreme reactions to the news and subsequent events. It helped me to quit minimizing and intellectualizing and to begin to sort through some of the difficult emotions and crises of meaning involved, or trying to attribute them to other things to realize that they were 'normal.' What a huge load it began to take off of my shoulders."
5,COMPLETE & UPDATED,Here is a complete and updated guide to all the elements needed to plan the Catholic Wedding Celebration. Very welcoming and logical in its information...and easy to use.
4,Very helpful,Not a bad resource for those trying to set up a catholic ceremony. Good sampling of readings to choose from. I'd recommend this to someone struggling for inspiration on setting up a catholic wedding.
4,Well worth the $3...and then some,"Together for Life really helps you to pull your Catholic wedding ceremony together. It's well laid out and provides easy instructions on how to plan your liturgy and which verses to choose. I wish it would offer a little more information on optional parts of the ceremony (i.e. candle lighting, Mary offering) but that is the only minor issue I could find. Good to get multiple copies - one for bride and one for groom."
3,nice explanations in english,I would think there would be a littl more available here. I think the reviews here are a little deceiving. The book is absent on the practice portions expected in a grammar book. I also thought there would be more to the book. A large part of the materials has to do with a listing of verb conjugations. Still it is easy to go through and could be of some help. I would say that anyone considering a new second level grammar book opt for the Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice by Ronni Gordon and David Stillman. Thats the best book around.
2,spanish lesson book,This is a difficult book for beginner-level spanish language students. I kept it b/c I understand that it is one they use at the immersion course I will be taking soon in Mexico.Probably will not use it before that or subsequent.
5,Wide Ranging Oboe Repertoire,"As others have detailed, this is vast and far ranging oboe performance from the likes of Saint-Saens, Poulenc, Schumann and Bach.I have reviewed oboe pieces from these composers, and found Vogel's performance to be quite worthy of five stars.However, the pieces by Britten and Shinohara are new for me and outstanding! These are flowing and satiny with a high gloss finish which is very delightful to the ears with the melodic, romantic sound that is so unique and pleasing to oboe lovers such as this reviewer. Vogel and his accompanists are to be commended for producing such a high-quality, wide ranging disc of one of the truly great soloist instruments."
1,Bose Wave music system multi-CD changer - Platinum White,Don't buy this. The only good part is the radio and main CD changer. I have the 3 CD changer I purchased 2 years ago to the day and it has stopped working. I have a stuck disc and disc error. Not sure I will get it fixed. I have read online that there are many many people with the same problem. Wish I had read the reviews. Bose Wave Music System with Multi-CD Changer -- Graphite Gray
3,Ford is the Fastest Gunslinger!,"Glenn Ford does his usual fine performance in this western which also stars Broderick Crawford who was not so believable as the aging cowboy out to find out who is the fastest gun alive. More believable if Crawford was replaced which a much younger, compatible actor. It is, however, a fine movie to see because of Ford. END"
5,Great classic western movie!,I remember seeeing it in the theater years ago. it still is as great today. Ranks with all great westerns. Well worth purchasing.
5,Must have tool,This is a must have tool for any bike repair shop at home. Order the balldriver instead of the flat end. Will give you a better torque on an angle. Sometimes it's a bit hard to use in tight places but overall would not do without
5,Must have,This is one of those must have tools if you do any kind of adjustment or work on your bike.
1,Not very good...,I always hate doing this to another christian but this guide's just plain bad. Poorly thrown together and wordy. God forgive me.
3,"Useful and entertaining, but incomplete and uneven","I wish there were more books like this: an accessible, mostly nonjudgmental approach to the differences between the Christian denominations in America today. In a style similar to the For Dummies and Complete Idiots series, Berry provides the history of each denomination and various offshoots, plus principle beliefs, worship styles, and what to expect if you visit. However the book needed more careful editing and fact-checking (the last section is particularly sloppy), and it seems odd to completely leave out Quakers, Mormons, and Unitarians. I understand her point in excluding the Unitarians (and can guess why she never once mentions the Mormons), but you'd think she'd want to add a few more details for the sake of contrast and completeness. Otherwise, this is a great starting point for the curious church-seeker, or anyone like me who is fascinated by the shades of belief and interpretation among Christians."
4,C'est formidable!,"As both a French minor and a cat owner, this book touches on two worlds that are very dear to me! The book is extremely funny, and will be read and re-read time and time again. The French is charming as well, and at times is tongue-in-cheek. The ""cat"" name Garfield is translated Garchamps. (Those who have to be told that champs is the translation of ""field"" will miss the humor in this, Tant pis.) It is a bit pricy, which is why it is 4 stars instead of 5. But it is extremely funny. (Hélas, je me répète)."
4,A classic!,I had not read this in years. I enjoyed reading it again then I passed it to my son to read.
5,:),"The fact that I got it for only four dollars was unbelievable! I've been looking for the cheapest prices on different sites, but Amazon never lets me down when it comes to deals such as this. The shipping was very reliable as well as the condition of its package. This book however is very explicit; would not recommend this to a minor due to its adult rated detailed content."
3,"Highly recommended book, but just ok","The words used by reviewers and readers were stunning, dynamic, monumental, remarkable debut......I found the book to be good, but NOT as great as other short story authors debuts. I was expecting something much better, especially after reviews from when he was here last spring. For a book that was supposed to be very erotic, I found the sex in it very selfish. I also found the men, shallow, gasping for love, gasping for intimacy, but very underdeveloped. Psychologically I wanted to know why each character lost the girl in the end. This is probabally the issue of the author, but I'd rather dive into the characters than the problems the author has with relationships.The strength of this book is the dialog and poetic prose, which were very very strong----actually delightful. The author should beef up his characters just a bit to give them real individualism, and then this book would be stunning, etc."
5,Must have,"If you are responsible for designing, reviewing, or interpreting environmental sampling and the resultig analytical reports, then BUY THIS BOOK, READ IT, DO THE EXCERCISES!You must have some background in statistics to understand it, so if you don't have that, take an introduction to statistics course. Otherwise go play in another sandbox, you'll be outclassed in this one. ;-)"
1,Statistical Methods for Environmental Pollution Monitoring,I never received the book and never received a refund for my purchase.What can I do at this time?What is your policy regarding deadbeats?Martin Haas702/228-7913martin777bk@gmail.com
4,good for a general ecology course or reference,"I have used this book for several years as a text for my general ecology course. Although simple errors may plague this book, it is one of the most comprehensive for a course involving field investigations. The appendix sections on sampling plant and animal populations and life table construction are very helpful for students and instructors. The book is strong on physiological ecology, plant interactions, and case history presentations."
2,"Beautiful voice, nice songs","Demis Roussos has a beautiful voice and sings many lovely songs, but the quality of this disk is very poor. You must turn the sound up as high as possible in order to hear and understand any thing. Would not recommend this to any one. Perhaps his others are better quality."
3,OK for students,"I'm not a musician and don't know much about percussion sets but this one costs about as much as renting one for my kid so I bit. There's nothing fancy about the kit but it does look relatively sturdy. It comes with a couple of pairs of drum sticks, drum and carry case. The keys sound properly tuned but a bit tinny to my ear. The set is adjustable in height. My kid hasn't used the drum yet so I can't comment other than to say it looks like it can do the job. The soft case is made of Vinyl and not well padded and could use better reenforcement on the corners. I have my doubts it'll last too long since the bell set is a bit heavy will wear through on the pressure points. As noted it's a bit heavy for a kid to carry so I recommend some collapsible roller to drag it, something like:Trademark Tools 75-CARTLUG Folding Travel Cart, Holds Up To 80 Pounds"
5,The genius of Peter Green,"This is my favourite of the early Fleetwood Mac's blues albums, containing some memorable Green guitar work, and some good examples of how he refined B.B.King's style, playing with taste and restraint, on ""Worried Dream"", and ""First Train Home"", his flair for understatement to the fore.Green succeeded in embellishing his BB influenced style with his own dramatic sense of dynmics, just listen to ""Fool no More"" where his choice of notes is exquisite; hereless is certainly more.It also brings to mind the Miles Davis' dictum, which can also be applied to BB King, namely that what isn't heard is as important as the notes that were. Other hihglights include the aponymous Mac signature tune, a mellow jam, and the explosive ""Drifting"".Peter Green was a truly innovative guitarist, who played with immense passion and fire. This album is a perfect example of that.(I haven't heard the remastered version containing the bonus tracks, my comments are based on the original CD release)"
1,the worst customer service ever,"DO NOT BUY JVC. I sent my car radio in after it needed minor repairs. They broke the usb port scratched it up & said to bad we didn't do it. It came to us like that. It didn't, they won't take any responsabilty at all."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed with the condition of the book for the price I paid for it. There was quite a bit of scribbling in the first few pages and some type of crusty matter on another page. The cover was quite dirty. I needed two originals of this book to replace a childhood memory for my daughters. I did purchase another original from another website for about 1/4 of what I paid for this one and it is in far better condition. I did not return this book because I could not find another original of this book.
1,Very poor install program,If you buy this program be sure your backup files are current. I had all the system requirement as specified but the install program ended abnormally and corrupted my system. I ultimately had to reformat my hard drive and reinstall my operating system and all my other programs. I would give this product zero stars if I could.
5,like just picked blackberries,I find it amazing that Oregon Fruit can process fruit and can it and it is just like it was just picked. These are wonderful berries.
5,Love It.,"I live Dehli 9. The first time I ever heard a Tosca track was off a mix set that had something from Dehli 9 on it. I was in love instantly. Suzuki is my favorite Tosca cd but this is a close second. This record is down tempo musical perfection. Very pretty, very easy to listen to on repeat. A must have."
2,Review,"This workout tape is a bit old fashion, the cover picture has nothing to do with the contents. Exercise, Background colors, and music all were boring. In my opinion it could be suitable for beginners."
4,They Work,"What can you say about underwear? I found it very frustrating to find white cotton poly blend shorts in the clothing stores. So, I am happy."
5,great camera,"I bought this camera and absolutely love it. It takes nice pics , is easy to use and has a lot of ""extras"" Best of all it's easy and you can use floppies. This is nice becuse when at family gathering I can take pics and simply give people the disks instead of fussing with cables and uploading. Defianately worth it :)"
5,Sony Mavica Digital camera,"Best digitail camera, Battery life is great! fully charged is 120 min and it delivers 120 minutes 1.3 meg pixels compaired to 2 meg is hard to see the diffrence depends more on the printer then pixels from what I've seen and done. No matter what stay with a sony and you'll be happy! I've used kodak and casio and neither even start to compair"
4,It was okay!,It was just okay. It was actually for my husband's morphology issues. It was tablet form. We eventually found a capsule form somewhere else but more expensive :( Either way I think capsule form is the way to go so your body doesn't need to break it down.Update: It didn't help my DH's morphology issues but his volume and count increased so I gave it 4 stars now. We are given it a try again!!
4,Fun for All,"This was a gift for one of our grandsons, but the whole family - grandma and grandpa included - have had fun with it. It is an excellent activity for children to look at an item as a whole and then find all the individual parts it takes to make a whole. It also can be a very creative tool allowing the child to make new and interesting creations. Even for the younger child, it provides educational play....separating the parts by color or shape, counting how many of each shape there are and which number is greater or lesser.....can occupy a four year old for hours! Good buy."
4,This is a great show!,"This was a great price for the series. The first disc did not function very well, I don't know if it was the double side taping, but it kept freezing. Otherwise, I enjoyed the show!"
5,There are not enuf stars!!,"From the halcyon days of the late '90's comes this gem...Tsunku's training in jazz is patently obvious in this, and his uncanny ability to mix 8 female harmony voices to jazz-pop/funk just has to be heard to be believed.This is also the first single with the 4 + 3, as Asuka had departed by then, which is sad, as Abe Natsumi became very much the lead singer at this time."
2,Too Many Problems!!!!!,"I own a cabinet business and we use 7 different routers on a regular basis. This router is without question the worst. When it's working properly, it is powerful, balanced and easy to operate. However, it is rarely working properly.The height adjustment is always jamming forcing us to take the entire assembly apart in order to clean it. In addition, the on/off switch often times does not work.I can honestly tell you that we spend more time repairing this router than we spend using it.If your interested in a simple, easy to adjust and trouble-free router, consider the Porter Cable 9690LR."
4,Nearly perfect (nearly...),"I bought this router when it first came out. It's my second router.At its latest pricing you get a plunge base included for what I paidfor just the router.What's great about it? As everyone said, the motor is smooth. Thebuilt-in speed adjust is nice. The best thing is the depth adjust.So easy, and accurate. If you measure that you need to go 11/64thdeeper, you can dial it in and know you'll get exactly 11/64ths.Also, the quick release on the coarse depth is nice in that you candrop the router down so the bit safely retracted, then when you popit up it's still at the depth you fine tuned before for a perfectrepeat cut.What don't I like? The ergonomics--as someone mentioned, its a bittop heavy and with round knobs it wants to swivel in my hands. And Ican never find the on/off switch. A hair tall and narrow to feelcomfortable sitting upside down on its motor for bit changes too."
4,it works,"I am using this on my 2000 GPH pump, it deos the job - however it is PVC - DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN - it will break, same as all PVC plumbing.If you are not familiar with plumbing get familiar before you destroy what you pay for."
4,Fun.,"The story is pretty well written, the characters are intelligent and sassy.This is a fun light read. Definitly worth a few hours of your time if you like light mysteries."
5,Great Second Book by Ellen Byerrum,I loved her first book and couldn't wait to find out where her Fashion Clues took her this time. It was a enjoyable read. I can't wait for the next book in the series that comes out August 2005.
5,excellent writing book,"This book was recommended to my by a famous and fabulous author;David Wroblewski- he spoke in Durham NC about his novel, ""The Story of Edgar Sawtelle"" recently. He writes beautifully and story-tells evocatively, full of feeling and movement. My experience with the book has been successful though I have not finished reading it, (I savor good books). The book goes into some detail about writing choices that are important. I carry the book with me everywhere. A great find for a new writer."
4,NARS,"Satisfied with the product, beautifully finished, well pigmented, good quality, I use it as blush cheeks with excellent results. What you purchase."
5,"Great product, most useful electronic in years!",This is a great deal for what you get. TIVO isn't any better (i know someone who has 1) With my Showstopper there is no monthly fee. It is a great product and i suggest buying one.
5,"Anything by Dvorak, the king of melody,moves me!","I am a great fan of Dvorak, and I especially like his Cello Concerto. Over time I had heard many of his Slavonik Dances,but I did not own a recording myself. I just love this recording with its rich tone and rhythm, and I especially like the Slavonic Dance #8. That one is not one of the more familiar ones, but one grows into it. Each dance when listened to a few times just speaks for itself and for the great talent of Dvorak.Tineke Goldberg, Napa, California"
2,Music is too popish and contrite,"I didn't enjoy this cd--it was too bubblegum and most of the songs were very ""singsongish"". Sounds like an amateur to me."
5,A powerful and helpful new book,"I just finished reading this book and could not put it down! It is a powerful book about how shame contrains women and what to do about it. The book is based on impressive research, interviews with hundreds of women, who shared their experiences with the author. Dr. Brown shares her personal stories along with her research and it makes for a captivating read. There are wonderful illustrations that make the text come alive. The book covers many topics where women experience the most shame, such as sex, parenting, and appearance. And best of all, the book gives us specific steps to take to develop ""shame resilience,"" like learning to speak the language of shame, to develop skills to resist cultural messages of shame, and to learn to share our shame stories with trusted other friends to diminish the impact of shame. I laughed, I cried. Highly recommended!"
2,Wrong!,"This film disgusted me. It wasn't what I expected at all.I have never seen such a violent film in my life. Baseball bat beatings, excessive fighting, stabbings... over 60 people die in the openning half and hour.This film is wrong. I have now idea how the MPAA could allow this film to be released.If this was the 80's this would have been banned... infact I'm not sure that it shouldn't be now.In total the death toll was well over 150... it makes Commando took like the Telly Tubbies! People get their heads chopped off and almost every 10 minutes there is another fight scene with another 20 deaths.The film makers should be stopped from ever making a film again as I will certainly never be watching one..."
3,"Doesn't Fit 37"" Vizio","I bought this wall mount because it claims to fit most 20""-40"" tv's, but the bracket is not long enough for my new Vizio 37"" LCD. Compare the length of the bracket you intend to buy with the distance between the mounting screws on the back of your tv before buying. Should be at least a few inches longer for correct fit. Otherwise, this product seems to be well made."
5,White Side/ Night Table with 2 Drawerss,It was just what I needed in my guest bedroom. A small night table with drawers. Yes the drawers don't roll out easily but for the price is okay. There is not putting the parts together since it comes as one piece. I did notice a slight smell but it disappeared within a couple of days.
2,CHINTZY UGH!,"First, the only plus -- this table came intact, no assembly. Otherwise, the drawers are ill-fitted, the top is not solid wood, the white stain barely coats the table. I wanted an inexpensive little table for the side of the bed, but what I got was a moderately-priced, cheaply-made table. Next time I will check for an unfinished piece at IKEA, as I have to re-paint the table anyway."
4,do you like punk rock ? You'll like this CD !,"Quite good CD. If you don't know another releases of Dezerter - this one is worth to start from it, because it's a good example of 80's/90's punk rock from Poland. Do you like Dead Kennedys or the Exploited ? Start listening to Dezerter ! If you know their older CD's - I strongly reccomand you to buy ""Ile Procent Duszy"" (it means ""How Many Percent of Soul"") - it is much better than ""Kolaboracja II"" and ""Blasfemia"". Generally they play faster, there's more energy in those songs. It's some kind of return to the way Dezerter used to play back in 80's and it's almost as good as ""Underground Out Of Poland"" - with ""technically"" better performance of sound."
1,find another book,Not worth a dime! Poorly written with no experiential power to back the words. Written for making money not enlightenment. Not even worth one star!
1,Don't bother,"If I'd had the chance to flip through this in the bookstore, I never would have bought it. There are no diagrams or illustrations, the directions are confusing, and the bags are generally hideous. (I would say that they were out of style, but virtually none of them could be said to have been stylish in any era.) If you're tempted to buy it based on the other reviews, do yourself a favor and check it out at a library or bookstore first. The (very) few tips it has to offer are better found elsewhere."
1,A stinker!,"I bought this thing a couple of weeks ago and found out to my dismay that it has the worst discription of how to hook it up that I've ever had the misfortune to read. I spent most of my spare time trying to follow these so-called instructions to hook it up to a new 36"" Sony. No dice. Finally I called in a TV repair man and to the tune of ... he didn't have much better luck. In my view this a pure pice of junk. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1,Poor customer service -unknown costs,The basic concept of the unit is not bad BUT; they don't tell you that the daily dial-in service costs can be very expensive if they don't provide you a local phone number. To minimize my costs Panasonic customer service said to unplug the phone and only plug it in once a week - right. Also you can't program the remote to control the volume on your A/V reciever so you have to use two remotes. And its been 3 months since I applied for my rebate and of course know one live will talk to me about it. Try tivo maybe they have it together.
3,"King, prince, Queen, big deal.","A Royalist will surely like this book. All those fuss about being prince, kings and all makes me feel cheap. The part when Pug got reconstructed into a Magician is actually great. The whole book is original. Just that the caste system is cheap, like all princes and princeses are great and Pug at last got rewarded to become one. Demeaning to reward everyone with great contribution to become a duke or squire or prince."
5,Outstanding!,"I started reading this book 2 years ago, since then I haven't been able to put any in the series down, each book in it's own right is a masterpiece! And the best thing is that Mr. Feist is STILL writing books for this series, he's up to about 14 so far. It may sound intimadating to have 14 or more books in a series but it's WELL worth the read!"
3,"Really hard to Follow, read the 1st one FIRST i guess..","I guess you need to read the first one before this one, otherwise youll be soooo lost. And anyway you maybe be lost in the first place. It goes off into like 4 different stories with all different characters, I couldnt even make it through. Maybe you will like it, I still keep an open mind."
2,Repetitious Repetitious,"The story was good, especially some of the parts about sex (with of-age consenting partners); but the facts were told over and over again. The story was good, especially some of the parts about sex (with of-age consenting partners); but the facts were told over and over again.If writing like this doesn't bother you, read this book."
3,Good material obscured by academic tripe,"While the subject matter of this book is interesting and the writer obviously has collected a lot of good base material, including first-hand research, I found the academic jargon of the book extremely off-putting. Many time I found myself slogging through turgid, overly complex explanatory material and then finding some nugget of genuinely interesting material (making me think ""Wow, I never thought of that!""), only to lose it once again amid the drek the writer uses to package it. This book would have been so much better had it used a less formal, more vernacular style, possibly even one that showed some sense of humor. As it is, it's quite dry, which is unfortunate since the subject certainly is not. Finally, I'd like to note that the review posted here by Edward Thomas Veal seems to me quite accurate in terms of spelling out the limitations of the author; some of what he points out was quite noticeable to me as well."
3,An anthropologist studies SF cons and fandom,"This was a treat, an in depth anthropological study of the culture of sci-fi/fantasy reading, writing, and publishing that I picked up from Pandemonium Books here in Boston. The roles of fans and conventions were scrutinized in depth, including the changing reception of women and homosexuals. The impact of ""New Wave"" writers in the 60s, the ever shifting face of the publishing industry, and how fans make the transition to writers were also studied. As interesting as all this was, the hard fact of how difficult it really is to make it as a full-time writer was thoroughly driven home and made for a depressing final note."
5,Very Enlightening & Easy to Read,This book helped me a great deal to see how I am actually in control of my own destiny and happiness. It has allowed me to move forward with an new positive outlook on life. This is a very enjoyable read and I would recommend to anyone willing to open their potential for a more full-filled life.
4,Best live,"John Martyn is one of those performers who is best live. This is one of his later live recordings, gone are the days of rocking back and forth in his chair making sweet music. This is with his band. Some excellent tracks and a guest guitar permormance from Dave G from Pink Floyd. If you want to drift away to the smooth deep tones of Mr Martyn then this is him at his almost best. (the BBC live album is the best, but sadly out of stock.)"
5,Great historical piece,"I loved the brief but accurate story ""On the Mayflower"". It's illustrations are clear, beautiful and strongly depictive of the famed ship and life and travel of the time, only surpassed by the children's expressions and generally creative photography. It's a must! Well done Kate Waters and crew! When you are ready to see and feel what the travelers from Europe to the New World in the 1600's did, pick up On the Mayflower. Can be used also as a fun, educational brief reading for ""fireside"" family gatherings and for children of all ages, especially elementary school programs."
2,Proprietary technology,"They don't tell you this very prominently, and they should--you must not modify the contents of an xD card except using the camera itself; otherwise you'll reformat the card, possibly rendering it useless, as the reviewer right beneath me discovered the unpleasant way. So don't ever use it with a card reader. If you're bringing picture files over to your neighborhood developing machine, transfer them onto some other media first.That's what happens when you have to use proprietary technology. Just about everyone else in the world uses SD now, but Olympus and Fuji insist on xD."
4,"Edgy, progressive sound.","This self titled debut album is a real rocker. If you want to expand your musical horizons, try it out. The style is progressive with influences that include Metallica, Smashing Pumpkins and Quicksand. Give it a listen, but do it when you can crank it up!"
5,One of the best Hendrix shows on CD,"This show is great, Jimi plays some of the greatest licks and riffs ever played on a guitar. Freedom, Red House, Dolly Dagger, Foxy Lady, Message to Love, Easy Rider, and In From The Storm are the best tunes from the show. I highly recommend getting the 2-disc set of this show."
5,Fantastic,"This was my first trip to the world of Cubanate, and I'm very pleased I made it. Compared to the older fans, I rate this release much higher than their previous ones. If you're into DnB mixed with psychotic, sometimes even melancholic industrial, you won't be disappointed."
3,too much drum 'n bass,Cubanate is one of those bands that always try to reinvent their sound with each new album. So far they succeeded quite well. This album however is simply not as good as the previous ones : the constant drum 'n bass rhythm works rather annoying instead of inspiring. It is then no surprise that the two best songs (namely the last two) are recorded during the Barbarossa-period. I hope that Mr. Heal and his companion will make less effort to sound trendy next time and that they will come up with some more furious industrial sounds.
1,worest book I ever had,"This is a book for somebody who does not know programming, and will never be a programmer"
4,A Nice Cannonball Intro,"this is my first introduction to Cannonball--as a leader--and this cd is fantastic...for all hardbop-heads, this is an outstanding addition to the collection. the first cut set's a mercurial tone, and he keeps pace throughout the entire cd."
4,Garmin Quest2,This my third Garmin GPS. All have worked very well. Replaced first two with the Quest2 because couldn't upgrade their internal maps. Quest2 can be used in a vehicle or hand held with topo maps. Good replacement for older models
1,What A Bust,"After much shopping around I picked the Garmin Quest 2 for its features and price.However, what I got was a product that would not work out of the box. Yes it would turn on and off go through the set up and menu options. Have taken this unit on several trips each time with another person trying to get the unit to work with no luck. What did I find wrong!o Will not navigate and give voice instructions, will only say (satellites lost)o Will not give accurate location.o Unit is very slow.At this point I could go on and on but what would be the point, save your money and get the Zumo 550 or 660 wish I had!"
1,Woulda been AWESOME on the ps1,"I rented this game because I am a fan of fast paced, hard hitting FPS games that are easy to control and require realistic cover tactics and some strategy. I also like artistic graphics, and a balanced online platform with a variety of creative environments.Unfortunately, it fails on all of these counts. I will not waste any more words on this lame piece of trash as others have done it for me. Suffice it to say, I regret even renting this for a paltry four bucks. If you are thinking of picking it up in the used bin, I encourage you to Think Twice before wasting your money."
3,"Like a less remarkable Doom 3, in HD, and Frame Rate Issues","The game has good graphics overall. Enemies are good too. But, the game is boring during the first half, it gets better towards the end. The game suffers from frame rate issues when many enemies are in the screen, specially surrounding you. I played Doom 3 in the xbox 1 and there wasn't frame rate issues and the graphics were the same, only that it wasn't HD. All in all, the Doom 3 on the xbox was a technological achievement, but this one a tech disappointment because the xbox 360 is far more capable to suffer from this frame rate issues."
3,"Great for converting VHS to DVD, but Tuner is Terrible","This model (also the DMR-ES35VS which I tried before) has a terrible tuner. When viewing TV programs (I have a 42"" Sony Wega High Definition TV) through the machine to record them, the picture is degraded by 40% I think, and the color is not vibrant. And this is with the HDMI connection. At first, I thought the HDMI cable that it came with was no good, so I bought a $90 HDMI Monster Cable, but there was no improvement in the picture. Also, the remote control does not have an eject button, why is that? Even my old VCRs and DVD recorder/player have that feature.If you want to convert VHS tapes to DVD only, then buy this machine it's great for that purpose. But if you also want to record shows from your TV, then I would suggest you check out other models/brands because the picture quality on this Panasonic is unacceptable (to me anyway). I will be returning this machine and will get another Sony, my two-year old VCR/DVD recorder has a great tuner."
1,Will play about 18 DVDs before breaking,You can Google any of these Panasonic DVD players and it appears they will all do the same as mine did with this model. Work at most 18 months and then give you a NoRead signal which you can't fix. I only played about 18 DVDs on this!
2,Tracy & Hepburn have nothing to worry about,"What a disappointment - the adaptation is so good but Anne Heche is terrible. You never heard such a whiny, grating airhead - eyuk! No woman lawyer on earth sounds like this. If she'd just used her normal voice it would have been fine - it's the classic trying-too-hard-to-be funny. The other actors are all pretty good, but if the main character is unbearable it's hard to listen to without being continually annoyed. My advice: skip this and re-watch the movie instead."
3,Mega Man X Emporium anyone,"Mega Man TV show is bland, lacks character development and suspense. Even Dragon Ball( Dubbed and Edited still contained the above content this show lacks.) The best episode was ""The Beginning"". Other than that I could come up with humorous spoofs for these episodes! Yes Mega Man X Emporium is a website made by fans. Maybe you could write some fanfiction instead of rotting you're brain watching this mindless drivel. My advice watch Dragon ball(Dubbed and Edited Version on Cartoon Network) it has a strong plot and believable scenarios."
5,Another HomeRun By.....Jay Warner,If you're into Vocal Groups......This Book is a Must.....It is one of the most visual and comprehensively well written books of its kind.LES LEVINE
3,A bureaucratic approach to laboratory design,"As always, the title of a book does not tell us its true content and scope. In this case the title and the content match, but in a very bureaucratic way. The ideas are carefully worded, but all the design challenge and the exemplification through images are gone. There is not a single image or exemplification diagram inside the book. It is an excellent INTRODUCTION to the design activities and concepts for a general-but-somewhat-specialized architectural task, but it is simply bothersome to professionals with a harsh need of an updated guidance in the technological and normative issues involved in that kind of interdisciplinary work. Had the book included the word ""Introduction"" my personal sense of deception was not so assured and asserted. If you want an introduction to that field before more deep technical literature, this book is really worth of each dollar you pay for it."
1,cardboard cut-out disease porn,"There is no context or depth to the one-dimensional, facile and perverse moralizing in this book. I read it over a decade ago, before travelling and speakign with people around the world. For a suburban college student, it was a shocker. As an adult, I found it to have the exact lack of context, multi-dimensionality and context as pornography. Substitute graphic sex for graphic disease and you have City of Joy. A huge disappointment."
4,Can't beat it for the price,"This platform bed is very heavy! my UPS guy needed a hand getting it down the driveway, it weighs in at 135LBS. You'll probably need two people to move this thing around. After un-boxing it and putting it together I'm overall very happy. It went together easily and seems pretty strong. I'm not a small guy and it holds me and my 10 inch memory foam queen mattress fine. I will say they should have veneered the platform the bed sits on. You can see the edge of the unfinished particle board if the sheets aren't hanging down. The manufacturer does paint the end of the board but not enough to hide the particle board.Remember this is a 150ish dollar platform bed so keep your expectations in line. For the price the quality is good enough if they simply veneered the top of platform it would be nearly perfect for what it is."
1,difficult,"very very difficult to put together. Driver didnt follow instructions, left the box outside, me and my neighbors had to drgag it upstairs to my apartment."
2,Bulky and not worth it,"Like a lot of the reviews that are on here states already, the box is long and bulky. Some pieces the holes don't line up, and some pieces were missing holes all together! I had to drill them myself. Once together this is heavy and still not that sturdy, you'd need a piece of plywood to drill in over the platform for it to be that sturdy. If you ever have to move forgot it. If you're going to live at one location for at least 10 years I'd buy this, If your planning to move anytime soon, forget it I don't think it would be in one piece after the move."
3,Lesson learned,Oh my stars! OUCH! If I bang my legs on the sharp edges of this thing one more time SHEESH. The bed is not as sturdy as I thought it would be but it's still in decent condition after 1.5 yrs. I will be putting this in a guest room at some point though and finding a new bed for my master bedroom.
3,"Interesting, but questionable","Another overpriced publication by Fedorowicz. As one reviewer stated, this is a poor translation of the unit histories of the 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions. Why another claims it is well translated and very readable may be he is not familar with the language. True, it does cover some of the most interesting battles of World War II: Russia early 1944, Normandy, Arnhem, the Ardennes, and the final battles on the Eastern Front in Hungary and Pomerania, but it suffers from the translation. For what there is available in English, this title is still of interest for those who enjoy German WWII history and a history of panzer units."
1,Lie,"LieWhen he(she) buys this product it(he,she) was indicating that it(he,she) had subtitles in Spanish and it(he) is not true, is a terrible lie on behalf of the company that sells it, and the box was coming gully.Amazon should sanction to this company for offering false information to the buyers, that disgustProduct DetailsActors: Lorne Greene, Pernell Roberts, Dan Blocker, Michael Landon, Lee Van CleefDirectors: Lewis Allen, Christian Nyby, Arthur LubinFormat: Box set, Color, Dolby, DVD, NTSC, Original recording remasteredLanguage: English, Spanish"
1,deceptive dvd cover.,"I bought this because it showed an early picture of Jimmy Snuka. He's very old. Yeah, he did a good job but I wanted-- and thought I was getting-- a DVD with an early match. All of the other matches are of old, once famous, big names. Nothing speceal here. On the other hand they're not the worst matches that you'll ever see, but not great, either.Thbe DVD played fine and the packaging is fine, exept the cover pictures are of the main participants in their youth."
2,Director takes great liberties with classic tale.,"This movie bears little resemblance to Swift's insightful work. Although its slapstick antics may appeal to some, it fails to bring any of Swift's pointed humor to the screen. All that is left from the book is the tale of a man who washes up on the shore of an island populated by tiny people. Frankly, I was very disappointed, but my 4 year old son seemed to enjoy it well enough."
2,Saul dissapointed me with this one...,"After reading ""Nathaniel,"" I knew that I was going to get into more of Saul's works. ""Black Lightning"" was the wrong one to pick. This novel has an excellent plot. The first couple of chapters makes the book seem very promising, but, after that, the story just goes downhill. After you've read more than half the book, the story gets exciting again. Then, once again, the story goes downhill...right down to the very end of the book. I had to build up excitment in myself just to finish the book."
3,Very promising start...but disappointing ending,"I was gripped by the story the moment I read the first chapter. Suspense, psycho-killer, a fast-paced storyline - everything you could have asked for in a thriller novel. Intrigued by the unnerving plot, I finished the story in 2 days. But somehow the ending just didn't live up to the expectation. Kinda anti-climax really... Read this only if you're an avid fan of John Saul."
4,Creepy doesn't even begin to describe this book about,"the execution of a convicted serial killer and the bizarre chain of events swirling around the life of the reporter who wrote of the killer's exploits. Containing typical elements of Saul's style, including a bit of overwriting here and there and an ending that doesn't quite do justice to that portions that preceded it, it's still a very good suspense piece. (Suspense may be a misnomer, however, since the denouement may be predicatable to some)"
5,This is the best book I've read since the Boxcar Children n,"Kevin Mitchell goal:2500 pages Book Club so far:500 pages Jan.19,1999This book is the best book I've read since the Boxcar Children.I would recommend this book to anyone ages 10-adult.My feelings about this book are great.I feel good to have read a book that is usually read only by an adult.The book is about a lady named Anne Jeffers,a New York journalist, who's been writing about this serial killer for five years. About a month and five years that he had been killing people, he is cought and prosecuted. Anne thinks that her nightmare is over for good, but she's dead wrong.About a year later a similar killing stuns the city as the butcher stalks/haunts Anne. Then Anne remembers the killers last words. ""This isn't over. How will you feel? It'll all start over again. How will you feel?"""
1,Disappointing at best,"I haven't read a John Saul book in a few years so I thought I'd catch up. This is a bad one to begin with as it makes the other two I have sitting here look rather unappealing.The ending, as many have said, is terrible. I was sitting there reading with about five pages of paper left and I couldn't help but thinking, there's no way this can finish off good.It really made no sense either. Without giving the plot too much away, the explanation of how things happened at the ""moment of truth"" was just too far-fetched and didn't add a thing to the story.There were no emotional connections to any of the characters except in the beginning of the book when you feel for Glen (Anne's husband) and Anne herself. But that all goes away very quickly as the boredom begins.I would not bother with this book."
2,Not Worth The Price Of the Book,Found this book to be a disappointment. Faux finishes are better explained in other publications.
1,unable to use after 2 days,"My five and eight year old sons loved this at first and had fun with the sounds it made. But after 2 days of playing with it, the spring wire got twisted and we were unable to fix it. Big bummer."
5,Funny movie,This is a very funny movie. Not sure I would recommend it for anyone under 15 as there is quite a bit of language and sexual references.
4,"Talented, But This Guy Needs An Editor","Plus: If it weren't for Bangs bands like The Stooges and MC5 would've never gotten their due (actually, they still haven't). Minus: If it weren't for Bangs, Chuck Eddy the would be rock writer wouldn't exist. This guy is a great rock writer, that is when he actually sticks to that subject. Unfortunately, this guy goes off on more tangents than I care to mention, especially since quite frankly I don't care about his personal life but simply wanted to read about some great rock n' roll. This makes his book only partially satisfying. I'm sorry he's dead, but let's be honest, like Hendrix and Cobain his death has given him an untouchable mystique that makes him almost immune to criticism."
4,"Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom!","Although a fine collection of Bangs's work in its own right, 'Psychotic Reactions and Carburator Dung' is not as good an introduction to Lester's writing as the recently released 'Mainlines, Blood Feasts, and Bad Taste: A Lester Bangs Reader."" While 'Psychotic Reactions' editor Greil Marcus chooses to focus more on Bangs as a prose stylist and cough syrup-chugging wildman, 'Mainlines'editor John Morthland presents a more definitive overall sampling of Bangs's critic ideas and opinions. Nevertheless, there is plenty of Bangs's best here, including the title piece, ""The White Noise Supremacists,"" ""A Reasonable Guide to Horrible Noise"" and the entire fourth section of the book, which collects Lester musings on the life and career of Lou Reed."
5,fester gangs,boy was i sad when i left my copy of this on the daggone bronx bound d train. bangs' writing is completely uninhibited and it's solid as rock. i wish i'd been a creem reader back inna day.
3,The Grey Room,"Eden Phillpotts greatly influenced the writings of Agatha Christie, so if you like her work, you should find Phillpotts' work interesting. The Grey Room takes place at a manor house on Dartmoor. The beginning paragraphs paint the scene beautifully, but, like most British mysteries, the plot and character development are the be-all and end-all of this novel. Slower and dryer than Christie, but an intriguing story. This edition does not identify the fact that The Grey Room was a serial publication and dates to 1920. It was in The Popular Magazine originally."
2,not for serious clinicians,"I am a third year medical student and have this product. The otoscope is okay, the ophthalmoscope is really bad. I have been able to visualize the fundus but it is very difficult since you cannot dim the light or change the size of the beam of light. Luckily, I am applying for orthopaedic surgery residency anyway so this doesn't bother me. I usually borrow a good one if I have concern about papilledema in a patient. If you plan on being a pediatrician, family medicine or any of the internal medicine specialties, I do not recommend this."
5,Inspiring,"I read this story years ago and remember being inspired by the courage of this young man. One reviewer stated that his plane was shot down, I thought that the bombs he was dropping detonated prematurely and caused the crash. Regardless, it's a great story about a guy who never gave up."
1,bb gun fantic,"well i read the first review then saw the seller resposne so i figuer so what and buy the gun, well the first person was right. i got about 1000 shots off with this i have the exact same gear box problem. i highly advise you do not by this gun."
5,A Family Hit,My kids and I fell in love with this silly tale of Christmas meets Fairytale land! I just wish it came in DVD format. We fell in love with this and watch it every year during Christmas! A great laugh for all!
2,disappointed :o(,I was disappointed in the very poor editing and scattered composition of this book. It was more a list of opinions and lines taken mostly from the newspapers. What could have been a really interesting piece of history turned out to be a really boring read.
4,F2.8 us useless for me,picture quality is good after F2.8F2.8 us useless for meMechanical is not smooth as my Nikon 600mm F4.0paint is off
3,Its a nice quiver but a little too short. I would buy again though for the price,Long arrows tend to make the quiver top heavy.I ended up moving where the strap connected to the quiver to the very top (sewing it on there)if its gets top heavy again I can put a little sand bag at the bottom.for the few bucks it costs its worth it. Nice strong materials and strap though if it were just 3-4 inches longer would be perfect
4,mice get stuck in it,it's fine it kills mice what do you wnat me to say the reason no one wants to do this is we don't have time to do such a long text box.
5,"Thomas Merton, Seeds of Contemplation","Reading books about Thomas Merton reflecting on our inner spirituality, meditating on principles of life and so much more leaves the reader ""lost"" in the book. This book is a very slow read because the reader reflects often on what is written. It is difficult to explain how Thomas Merton is simplistic in verbage yet his sage insight makes one ponder their own thoughts and actions about life. I recommend any and all Thomas Merton books. Be mezmorized."
5,Expensive delivery costs.,Very pleased with the book.Enoying is the fact that the expedition costs only appear at the end.The difference in transport charges can be important and should be known sooner.Even more disturbing is the fact that some chosen books appear to be undeliverable to Europe.This is only being informed at the end of the purchase project. Very inefficient indeed.Greetings.
5,Finding a Way,"I am in recovery and this has been a valuable tool in expanding my ideas about God, his nature, and our connection with him and my fellow man. Have been a fan of his for 20 years and only truly started reading this deeply in the last year. Truly invaluable knowledge."
5,Modern Prophet,"Thomas Merton is a modern prophet, and ""New Seeds of Contemplation"" is his calling from the desert. Engaging a new generation in the ancient practice of meditative and contemplative prayer, Merton [re]introduces contemplation into the lexicon of contemporary Christianity.An easy and engaging book, ""New Seeds"" can draw today's believers more deeply into the faith of our Fathers. This book is a must for those seeking to more profoundly experience God in their prayer lives.Reviewed by: Dr. Jeffrey Wincel (D.Min), author of ""Climbing The Mountain of God, The Path to Mystical Discipleship"",Surviving the Fall, America's Second Great DepressionandDefying the Trend: Business Ethics and Corporate Morality from a Faith Perspective"
5,Greatly satisfied!!!,"The book is in great condition except the worn dust jacket. The hard cover stayed in good shape without any wrinkle.With the price, I am so satisfied with the quality and the condition!!!A really good saler, a really good book."
5,Well Done!,"As promised, quick delivery. Anyone interested in this product knows that it is the handbook used by therapists and diagnosticians and will be up-dated in near future."
5,One Word..............SWEET!!!!,YO! this game is awesome its off the hizzy this game is the best in the world i also like the characters i already beat i like sonics dark side
4,Shadow the Hedgehog,"This game is fairly good. Unlike most Sonic games in which you need to home attack an enemy (with great danger of dieing) you get to use guns,vehicles,ect. Unfortunatly, guns have very limited ammo. For some reason swords/street signs break after whacking 5 times. Every charecter swears, which is appalling. Here are the pros and cons of the game.Pros:nice graphicstheme song is good if your a rock fanother charecters help youprojectile weaponsgood level designGUN and Black Arms vehiclesyou find out a lot about ShadowCons:swearingvery limited ammocan be dificult"
5,Shadow Video Game,This video game is almost like sonic the hedgehog video game. This video game deals more with robots and finding out who he is and all the excitement takes place in outerspace. It is very exciting. My son just loves this game and plays it all the time. This is his favorite video game. You will not be disappointed in this game. It's a fun game.
5,Great baby blanket!,"This is a great, stretchy, breathable blanket. I bought it when I was swaddling my baby in the summer since I didn't want a heavy blanket. It's great all seasons. Washes well."
3,"Not his best, but good nonetheless","I am the first person to admit that I am a truly die-hard Seal fan. If he made a CD reciting the New York City phone book I would buy it, so I was literally waiting with baited breathe for this new CD. For me, I actually had to listen to it 3 or 4 times before it hooked me. I don't know that ""Human Being"" will become the classic that his second CD has become, or if it will spawn any real hits. However, I suggest that you keep listening, and it will definitely grow on you. I suggest ""Lost My Faith"", ""Just Like You Said"" and ""Colours"" if you just want to go to a listening station at the music store to try it on for size. If you pay close attention to the lyrics, he's just as thoughtful and introspective as ever, so there's no frivolity there. Overall, real Seal fans will not be disappointed."
4,"""Human Being"" is good not great","Seal is the man of exploring or exploiting...and this album has some personal issues that Seal will truly tell you though things....""Human Being"" is a good album when you put on mind into it...this may not be like his first two album but I think that if Seal works with William Orbit...he would be great on his next album...Seal don't worry you have not lost your touch...."
5,his 'introspective' best,"i can relate to those who see seal as a melodic pop meister, judged by his previous records. but this record lets us know he can create from within, his emotional best."
3,Great! But not his best.,"Though spiced up by ""Lost my faith"" a dark, anti-ballad of loss, this CD is not quite as exciting as his first two. ""Princess"", especially, is confusing. Obviously personal to Seal, it's lyrics surely carry some meaning, but I'm at a loss! I hope that at some point Seal comes back with a fourth CD, because though this album is better then most artist's best, it's not his best."
2,Very Mediocre,I have been a Seal fan since Seal (I) and I'm not impressed. The songs all sound like recycled and watered down versions of tracks from previous albums. Skip it.
3,Makes an acceptable strawberry ice cream,I threw a drained can of these berries into the ice cream machine with whole milk and some powdered sugar and it came out no worse than Breyer's. I would keep this on hand for the winter months when fresh berries are not in season and because these berries are from Oregon and not from South America as fresh berries often are these days. I would probably only use them for ice cream.
1,Lousy Excuse for a Book,"I reread the book recently for an essay I have to write and I think the novel has no whatsoever merit to it at all. Johann Lee's youth is no excuse for his lack of literary talent. Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein at the age of 18.The coming-of-age novel is an exercise of his vindication of what he has done and not done: it plays on sexual stereotypes and yet at the same time, it tries to exult the author's status to the pedestal.However, this is slightly better than Edmund Wee's The Narcissist, another Singaporean account of his gay life."
4,Against Psychiatric Torture!,"This is only one of several excellent books that I have seen recently warning of the extent of governmental use of ""psychiatrists and/or psychologists""The astonishment and horror that one experiences when reading allegations of the misuse of drugging, of hypnosis, as well as other forms of abuse cannot be overemphasized. The abuse that DOES become known represents only the tip of the iceberg, according to the Foundation for Truth in Reality and also Citizens Commission on Human Rights International, both of which are available on-line, and cannot be meliorated by allegations concerning the misbehavior of the victims of such torture.Every human being, including every alleged wrongdoer, is entitled to fundamental human rights of autonomy, privacy and due process of law. Nothing excuses the violation of such rights."
4,Nice mirror,"After breaking my floor length mirror I was in the market for a replacement. Saw this mirror and it looked right for the price. Assembly was easy and it is a nice mirror...not sure I believe that it is a $600 mirror, but the free shipping and ease of assembly makes it a steal at $185. If you're looking for a wide mirror you may want a different size...it will take some getting used to for me."
3,"Cat's still got it, just not as much...","I like this OK, but if you don't have any of her CDs yet, get Moon Pix."
4,Deceiving..badly,"I come to Amazon.com to get album art for when I rip my CDs to my computer. BUT THERE IS SOMEHTING WRONG WITH THE PICTURE OF THIS ALBUM ART. IN REALITY IT IS A VERY SHINY COVER AND TO TELL THE TRUTH THAT MAY HAVE BEEN WHY I BOUGHT THE ALBUM IN THE FIRST PLACE SO DON'T BE DECIEVED, IT REALLY IS VERY SHINY AND YOU SHOULD BUY IT!!!"
2,"Like the other raters said, these don't work on fiberglass arrows","I bought these nocks for use with fiberglass arrows. Unfortunately, they won't fit on these because they are too short."
5,Awesome,"I really love this game. I'm not much of a gamer but I really enjoying playing this one, both by myself or in multi-player mode."
1,Great Game For 3 Days,"This is not really multiplayer. You cannot connect other 360's and play multiplayers and you cannot play more than one player per box on Xbox Live. This is Microsoft trying to maximize profit at the expense of increasing game players. They want to sell an Xbox, game and controller to every person that you want to play with.It is a great single player game, but only for about 3 days. By then you have beat all the levels and, since you can't get your friends into a game, you are done with it.It seems that Microsoft does not like the way that Halo allowed all your friends to play at once with you."
3,Low Ratings for Multiplayer Gameplay,"I hate to ding this game but I must say the lack of the ability to have a private game and excessive lag on multiplayer is a complete waste of what otherwise would be a great game. It's sad as there are times the gameplay is quite good (no lag) but then you have all the trash talking folks making noise just to make noise, yes you can mute them, but what about just having your group of friends in a private game, yeah you remember, the feature that made xbox what it is today...friends lists? Well too bad, they're out as trying to get your friends into a game is next to impossible due to the nature of how games are hosted. The games start too quickly. Fix this and the lag issue and you have a great game. Without, well I'll probably trade mine in for something else."
3,diZZyFunk!,"The pre-bop swing of dizzy's trumpet and the trademark shout-scats of his melodic-roaring voice is something that you will NOT find on this album. After penning the masterpiece ""Gillespiana"" for Dizzy in the 60s, famed Brazillian composer-pianist Lalo Schiffrin decided to take Dizzy's sounds to a new level, ushered mostly due to the soul-jazz and the street funk of the 70s, Schiffrin pens FUNK compositions for Dizzy. There are some strong funky tracks in there that caught me by total surprise, however the album has its weak moments too, thanks in most part due to the poor diluted funk that fences on the side of disco (sic!) than funk. Ray Parker Jr. (yeah, the same dude who penned ""ghostbusters"" in the 80s) and Wah-Wah Watson give us some traditional funk licks floating on thumping fender basslines. On the whole, a disappointment for ""purists"" bred on swing-n-bop....BUT possibly an outlet for hip-hop DJ samplers!"
1,Very Misleading Title,"I didn't find this book to be anything like it's title suggests. Rather it is a ""coffee table book"" with hundreds of one liner quotes from celebrities, none of which appear to be about other celebrities. It's more of book of quotes...period."
3,Great Bathroom Reading,"If you love the movies, and who doesnt, you'll love this collection of quotes from actors, directors, etc. They're wise, witty, bitchy, etc. Every week I plow through my issue of Entertainment Weekly in hopes of finding comments from celebrities as incisive and memorable as these. Here,they're in such profusion its incredible. Really enjoyable and enlightening."
2,Greenleaf doesn't know as much as he thinks he does.,"This book is marred by some rather amazing lapses. For example, Greenleaf asserts that one's socks should match one's shoes when in fact they should match one's trousers; that single-breasted suits are more traditional than double-breasted ones when in fact the opposite is true; that a four-in-hand tie knot is a half Windsor; that a half Windsor tie knot is a full Windsor; and that a full Windsor tie knot is a double Windsor. It's not that there is no useful information in this book. It's just that Greenleaf makes too many mistakes and charges WAY too much for too little information."
2,Won't Help You Very Much,"The advice in this book is so elementary as to be almost insulting to most readers. An example: Be sure that the shoe polish matches the color of your shoes.There are many other books available with rich content which are easy and fun to read, such as Esquire's Things a Man Should Know About Style."
2,Bent blades,"Like a previous reviewer, my corona lopper blades bent on 1"" limbs. The original sticker said it was good up to 1.5"" branches, this ad says it'll eat 2.5"" limbs, but that was not my experience. I've never cut anything harder than oak or pine, and never anything thicker than an inch. But now the blade is bent, and it won't get through half-inch limbs without a fight. I assume there is harder steel on other products. I'll find out this summer.FWIW, while the blade was straight, these loppers made quick work of some green branches that were less than an inch thick, and the handles took all the abuse I dished out. The second star is for that reason. The non-blade parts of this thing have held up nicely. They're also 5 years old, and only now have a little rust on them.Apart from the bent blade, these are good loppers.But the blade is pretty much the clutch component, seriously. So I won't buy these again, I'll try a different brand."
4,Good Loopers,"I have used Corona products for years, after all my name is Lopez. In all fairness this cutter is as good as it gets. Plenty of capacity with some of the longest handles on the market. Cutting anything larger than this looper can handle should be done with a saw."
1,A printer not worthy of the HP name,"This printer looked great on paper. However, the wireless driver software is full of bugs. It totally locked up my laptop when I installed it. I had to uninstall it permanently so that I could use the std office suite. It worked well from my desktop with wireless connection or a while. After about 1 year of service during one cartridge change it started not recognizing the cartride. That was the end of it. HP support tried to help me, I spent many hours resetting it in many ways, changing cartridges 3 times, etc., based on their numerous e-mail recommendations. The printer never worked again. I have been using numerous HP inkjet printers for 10+ years, without any problem. But after the pain with this 7410 printer I will probably never own another one."
1,Always malfunctioning,"This is the most frustrating piece of hardware I've ever owned. It is forever breaking down. We have to stop what we are doing every few copies to reset the drivers, undo paper jams, and adjust the printer cartridges. It runs through ink like a teenage boy drinks milk from the fridge, and the cartridges are very expensive. The features are great but the time it takes to get a few regular copies or printouts made is usually not worth the hassle. HP printers used to be the most reliable ever, now they seem to be unreliable junk like every other giant corporations'."
4,Not the Best But The Most Well Kown,"Wu Tang Clan Ain't Nuthin and Shame on A Nigga are the best songs out of these. Can It Be All so Simple.. I have a hard time not reminicing to that one. This song needs to be played on mega speeks. Strictly crew songs here except Can It Be All and Method Man. Don't think you can replace Enter the 36 Chambers with this comp. You're missing too much good music. In fact notice that all songs are from WTC albums. Think about how many songs that WU made that aren't represented here?!?! I mean on the individual ODB, Meth, Genius albums. Whoah! Real WU collectors will look past this CD and put up those fedz."
1,It sucked,It did not play on my dvd player because we live in the United States. So I can't even play it. Waste of money :(
3,Epic story rendered borish through immature storytelling,"That upstart California wineries exploded, in 1976, the myth of invincible French wines deserves better treatment than it receives in this film. The screenwriter distracts the audience with gratuitous sex and superficial relationships, either because the true story is so dull it's not much worth telling, and therefore needs jazzing up, or because the screenwriter believes gratuitous sex and superficial relationships are more worthy of chronicling than the maturation of an important U.S. industry.Since this film does not pretend to be ""a true story"" but simply ""based on a true story"", the writer had license to tell it pretty much however he or she wanted. He should have used that latitude to embellish the truth with more full-bodied themes. This film, if it were wine, would be light-bodied and slightly sour; - fell short of its fuller and richer potential."
4,A Shock of a movie,"While some people might immediately try to compare this film to Sideways, that would be a big mistake. Both films might share wine as their subject matter but diverge dramatically from there.Bottle Shock tells an unknown story of Californian wine beating French wine in a surprise blind taste test (no one was more surprised than the French).Having the US as the Underdog, seeing the passion of the wine makers and seeing the French being served makes this an absolutely wonderful 2 hours.Bill Pullman was superb, Alan Rickman portrayed the quintessential snobbish Britt, Rachael Taylor was stunning and Dennis Farina was ""Bacon Fat with a hint of Ripe Mellon!"""
4,Love Alan RIckman and Bill Pullman!,"I absolutely loved ""Bottle Shock""! I hadn't even heard of it before I started doing some research into Alan Rickman films. I'm the biggest Alan Rickman fan, and I was not disappointed in his performance. He definitely shows his comedic chops here, he's an all around consumate actor and I love all his work.Bill Pullman was great too. I've enjoyed him ever since ""Spaceballs"" and ""While You Were Sleeping"". His performance is spot on.I am blanking on the others actors names at the moment, but their portrayals were wonderful too. The guy from Star Trek, who plays Bill Pullman's son, was suprisinly better than I thought he'd be. The other guy, the one that used to be in ""Six Feet Under"", was very believable too.I would definitely recommend this film to any Alan Rickman or Bill Pullman fans.Jana"
4,I love Alan Rickman.,"Ever since i watched my first Alan Rickman movie (Truly, Madly, Deeply), I have been in love with him. I think there's something sexy and mysterious about his look and voice. Anyway, this is not my favorite movie of his, but is interesting. I enjoyed seeing the beautiful scenery, and found myself believing the characters. It's worth a look, in my humble opinion."
5,Great Movie,"If you are a ""wino"" like me, you will appreciate this movie about how the wine industry got started in Napa. It's a solid film that teaches you a little bit about viticulture and have a few laughs in the process."
1,A Long Documentary About A Hypocrite,"""Forgiving Dr Mengele"" is an unnecessary long documentary about a Holocaust survivor's tragic experience under the hands of Dr Mengele in the Auschwitz concentration camp. You will be filled with remorse until the moment she meets with Palestinians (unless you're prejudice towards Palestinians or ignorant about the Palestinian-Israeli issue). While she was meeting with Palestinians who were telling their tragic stories under the Jewish immigrants (Israelis) rule after they took over Palestine, the Holocaust survivor's reaction and demeanor towards them was surprisingly cold, which was appalling considering that she was a victim of the Holocaust. This documentary is a demonstration of how people can attempt to gain sympathy from others by telling their tragic stories of others oppressing them, yet have no sympathy when they are part of a group who is oppressing innocent people for their own personal gain. It shows that history won't teach some people a lesson."
2,Did not work,"I bought this for FinePix S5PRO camera by Fujifilm. S5PRO has the same body as Nikon D-200. This flash simply did not synchronize with the camera - that is, the flash did not even go off at all. I returned it and 47th Street camera store quickly refunded the money after 15% restocking fee."
1,Big Disapppointment and Frustration,"I bought this camera for my son. After 7 minutes of recording, it stopped working. The camera shut itself off and told us to delete the footage to make room for more, but it wouldn't stay on long enough for us to delete anything.The quality of the footage was terrible!After spending over an hour trying to figure it out, we gave up and returned it to the store.It was the absolute worst experience I have ever had with a toy."
1,A Waste Of Money,"This toy is a waste of money. The video quality is extremely poor, and any kid who has seen (and used) his parents' video camera or digital camera will be very, very disappointed in the frankly lousy quality of the video off this thing. No flash, VERY dark jerky images. I'd say for the money, kick in another $50 and buy your kid a ""real"" digital camera or a used ""real"" videocamera, if you want to encourage this kind of activity. Don't waste your money here, sorry to disappoint you but it's a stinker."
1,"Terrible quality, not worth the price","I bought the Vcam for my 9 year old niece because she loves to play with our digital camera. When it was delivered I tried it out first and I am so glad I did. While the camera was cute, the quality seemed very cheap, the buttons were difficult to push, and I was unable to take any pictures! I returned it and for about $30 more bought an inexpensive ""real"" digital camera. A child who is old enough for this camera will probably be better of with an adult camera."
3,You can get a better deal for your money...,This stereo is OK... but you could do better. Sound quality is poor and it looks a lot better on the picture than it is in reality. It's just cheap.
1,trash,I RECOMMEND NOBODY BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNKOF A SO CALL CD AMFM CASSETTE PLAYER.THE DOESN'T PLAY PROPLELY.IT'S FALLING APART.PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH.IT'S A WASTE OF GOOD MONEY.
5,"Focus work out, you'll see result","Excellent DVD, targets the abs like any other video i've tried, really effective, rates your heart up a lot and you will feel the pain in your abs the next day, and you know it ""no pain no gain"" a very entertaining way to work out, really motivating and you can see in the backgroung there are people from all levels of fitness so you can see where you are right now, and where you want to be on a few months, highly recommended for those who wants sexy abs but dont have time to hit the gym"
3,Narative by young Derek Sanderson/ Boston Bruins Star,"Any fan of the Bobby Orr era Boston Bruins would want this book. Written with Stan Fischler, it reads more like a monologue (it was likely written from taped interviews), but has detail and insight from a very young Derek Sanderson during the height of the powerful Boston Bruins and Bobby Orr. Derek talks about his days as a youngster (yes, he really reflects on the important days as an eigth grader!) and times with the Bruins. Oh, and he reveals why he REALLY got the nick-name ""Turk""."
2,"Too Much Babble, Not Enough Stories","Even though the were a lot of stories about the road, The book was nothing more than a Dusty lovefest. I wanted stories about wrestlers he liked or disliked, more stories about the booking aspect of the industry and less stories about hating on Hogan and chapters about your top 10 Dusty fans and how people copied off of your ideas. Starrcade, Kevin Sullivan, Ric Flair stories is what i was looking for in this book. I was disappointed and i was left wanting more."
1,easily the WORST of the WWE series of autobiographies,"I can't agree more with the other reviewers...this is pretty much worthless. Of all the wrestling bios I think I looked forward to that of the common man ...the ""American Dream"" more than most and was very disappointed by this lightweight drivel and back slapping. This book hurt my impression of Dusty and that rarely happens after an autobiographical read."
1,"Shipped Product Does Not Match Description, Poor Quality","The shipped product does not have the ""one tool"" pin. This appears to be an error by Amazon. The hitch itself was of poor quality and the base where the ball mounts was not parallel with the shaft making the ball lean lean sideways."
1,Not worth it!!!!!,"i got this vugo for xmas and i thought it will be really fun. it froze on me when i plugged it in the computer. im definetly get a psp, nintendo ds or something much much better. this is definetly not worth no $100. get your money back immediatly because im going to get my money back asap!!!"
1,What a waiste of money!!!!!,"I bought this for my daughter last christmas and haven't been able to use it yet! We have a Mac, Vugo told me that is was compatible well, they lied. Secondly they knew it was a piece of crap because they sent me a $[...] gift card and some other coupons to distract me from returning it. I have not bought a hasbro toy since."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS MERCHANT!!!!,This merchant is bad news! Even Amazon is unable to get a hold of this guy. Amazon finally credited me back what this merchant wouldn't and all I can say is this guy is to be avoided and thrown off of Amazon or any online merchant website.
3,Great series but a terrible blu-ray,The series is amazing but the picture quality of this set is terrible. It doesn't look any better than an upscaled DVD and actually worse than some 480p stuff that streams on Hulu. The only positive I can say is that the DVD box set costs more than the Blu-Ray so this is the better deal if you have a Blu-Ray player.
5,"I don't watch much anime, but this is pretty epic",I'm a casual anime-viewer... some anime I really like but most strikes me as dry and unimaginitive. Claymore is really amazing. Like most anime it takes place in a world that is fundamentally different from our own but it's got a lot of class. 5 starts.
5,"Excellent Guide even for Access 95, 97 Developers","I bought the Access 95 version of this book, and later was forced to buy the book to study a particular Access 2 feature.I was struck by how much value the book adds. To me, this is more of an in-depth introduction to Access development than any book outside the ""Building Applications"" manual. It far surpasses that manual in terms of explanation and samples."
4,i like this,"semi greasy but that fades really quickly. i have very combination skin with very dry and oily patches, and this product works well for me. i love that the spf in this doesnt seem to break me out, also it does not smell like spf at all. it does not last very long though, and doesnt do anything particularly amazing for me, so i dont ""love"" it. but all in all a great buy, i wish you got more for your money. would purchase again."
4,City of Ember,City of Ember is a movie that I saw before having read the book so I do not come with any expectations. The storyline is well developed but feels at times rushed. The movie could have been around 2 hrs long and some of the plots could have been more developed. The special effects are very nice and I think Bill Murray was amazing in the role as Major Cole. I enjoyed the movie but as I mentioned before it would not have suffered if the movie was a tad longer. All in all an enjoyable movie. 4/5.
2,"Had potential, but an overall failure","Very forgettable film. I watched it a few months ago, and I can't even remember what I don't like about it, I just know I don't like it."
3,Read the book instead!,"I was very disappointed with the movie version of this story. First, they gave away the major secret to the movie within the first few sentences. The movie glossed over the details that made the book great, and added things like the giant mole which were completely unnecessary. Please, if you haven't read the books, please read them. They are nothing like the movie and DuPrau is a fantastic author!"
5,great to watch,This is a good movie to watch. The entier time you know something will happen but you dont know what. It can keep you on the edge of your seat even if the book is better.
1,PLEASE Read the books instead!,"This movie is a complete mess and I don't even know where to start... Based on the book by Jeanne DuPrau. The characters were changed and meshed together, the storyline and plots were changed. Ugh, I am a huge fan of The books and I feel that whoever produced and directed this film should not be allowed to every do this again!"
1,Crap,"I usually dont rate movies, but I needed to say something about it.I cant believe the reviews on here.1) I'm a Bill Murray fan (glad he only had a bit part in this movie)2) I AVIDLY watch moviesLastly, this movie was absolute garbage. Everything about it was lame and unimaginative.Maybe if you want to have the TV babysit some 5yr olds, go ahead and put it on, but as far as serious entertainment, you'll be wasting your time.I wont go into details, because it will turn into a rant, but watch this free somewhere if you have to."
3,"Good Movie, Terrible DVD","It is pretty unbelievable to me that a fun little adventure movies with 5 Academy Award Nominated actors (Ronan, Murray, Jean-Baptiste, Landau and Robbins) whose commentary I would love to hear, would let this DVD be as ""bare bones"" as possible.Walden Media has done a great job with their films, including the DVD extras on one of my favorite films ""Bridge To Terabithia."" As well as Playtone has made some DVD's with incredible extra's like the 2 DVD directors set of ""That Thing You Do!"" How can they just push this movie to the side?3/5 for the movie - not the DVD"
5,Great movie!,"I had no idea what to expect from this movie, but I loved it! I agree with other comments that the ending was a bit abrupt, but I guess that was okay because it got me looking online to see if there was a sequel and lo and behold the movie is based off a book series! So, I bought the books. I would definitely recommend this movie."
5,Worth buying and watching!,"This Video, Golf's greatest shots Vol II is definetly worth buying because it has many great shots and moments you wouldn't want to miss. Buy this vvideo and you will be satisfied."
4,"Nice, but i dont see the blue ray quality.",I liked it but i dont see the blue ray quality it looks standard to me. and its NOT 1080p because itsscaled to a 4:16 ratio. -.-
2,Funimation strikes again.......,"With no plans to release 1.3 now as the project has been ""haulted"". The fans who invested in the first two Blu-Rays are estentially screwed over... and just when they seemed to be getting it right. Screw funimation... I will no longer be purchasing any of their products/re;eases and hope nothing but the worst for them down the road."
5,"Readable style, makes reader wish they could know Molly","Karen ponders many questions maybe every parent ponders as she learns and grows with her little girl everyday as she asks for ""mollypops"" at the doctors office, is thrilled over colored socks,is afraid of splinters. Delightful well written==was a book I read the firstday. Describes Mollys questions, fears,views on materialism, schools, those who have less. Karens husband is pastor, Dr.Jeff Zurheide, author of When Faith is Tested. Molly is a typical preachers kid in the book. The picture on thecover is adorable. I rate this book five stars==and hope her next book is published soon."
5,Yoga Weight-Loss Workout for Dummies,I got this DVD after Thanksgiving Holiday. Since then I do exercise every day. This is a very good program.
4,Easy workout,"I ordered this DVD along with a bunch of other ones, including some Jillian Michaels ones, and right now those are what I'm focusing on. I tried this one once and I found it to be enjoyable and easy.It's about 35 minutes long once you get started, and it flows from one pose to another. I love Chris Freytag, and she takes time telling you how to do the poses, then picks up the pace once you've gone through them.I gave it 4 stars because it's not as intense as what I'm into doing right now, but it's still a good workout for a yoga workout. I'll definitely use it from time to time, when I'm looking to do a little extra exercise."
5,yoga weight loss for dummies,"I really like this workout. It is easy to follow. I also have Pilates weight loss for dummies, but I like this one better. It is a 35 minute workout. 20 minutes of standing yoga and 15 minutes of mat work. I would recommend it."
4,Good Workout,I use this DVD with the help of a Swiss Exercise Ball and get a good workout and stretch. I felt somewhat ill using some poses without the ball.
3,Yikes!!!,This Book is not for the faint of heart! I knew Sean Tejaratchi when he was a teen at his mother's house in Walker Basin so I just had to have a copy. Well Sean you still are marching to a different drummer! Best wishes.
3,HORRIFIC,"I ordered this because I read and enjoyed Katherine Dunn's novel, Geek Love, and was curious to see what she had to say in the text of such a photo book. I received it on a friday and looked it over, and as a result felt rather tweaky for the rest of that weekend.I returned it the following Monday.This book is long on horribly brutal and depraved images and short on Dunn verbage. The fact that the images are real makes them, yes, fascinating, but still very very disturbing. It would be an excellent antidote for some one who thinks of death in terms of action film images. If you have young kids and want to keep this book, I recommend keeping it well hidden. I have a young child, and I'd hate to have him someday find something like this on the shelf by chance and be exposed to such horror."
5,"Disturbing, but amazing","This book is a compilation of one man's collection of crime scene photos from Los Angeles throughout the 40's and 50's. The images are very graphic and let us see images we never would get to see unless we were members of the protective services. The black and white images somewhat create the illusion that what we see isn't quite real, although we know better. There is just enough information to understand the scenes. In my opinion, this is the best crim scene photo book available on the market."
5,Well designed stable case,"With all respect to the one negative review here, the design of the fan sucks air down from the sides and blows it out from vents in the rear. The fan is almost as wide as the drive itself and seems to keep things very cool. I own three of these (a five inch, and two 3.5) and all are working perfectly."
1,Cheap..Cheap..Cheap!,"I was so excited to get this. I had recently upgraded to the Canon Rebel digital only to find that the lens included in my package did not hold a candle to my old ones. Locking the adapter to the lens was a mess. The minute I removed it from the box I realized how delicate (cheap) the product was. I managed to get about 10 shots with my old macro when in an attempt to focus the lens...pop...right off again. While trying to reattach the product to the lens it simply fell apart. I paid $40 for about 30 minutes of lens use. For the record...I am a 5'2 female, 100 lbs and not someone who is overly rough by any means."
1,Waste of Money,"First off, the item is not made by Canon despite ad claim. Its corrective lens is poor quality and NOT coated such that the images captured by your high quality FD lens are mediocre at best. So why try to use a great lens and have its image messed up by a lousy corrective lens? Now I have a gadget that I will never use and an unresolved problem."
3,Inferior quality product,"I would not rate this product beyond 3 stars.You can use your FD lens all right. The one that I received does not lock properly with the body, in fact while using the Canon FD 70-150 lens, the lens with the adapter came out from the body while focusing. Luck I did not drop the original FD lens.The lens in the adapter is poor quality. At that price I wasn't expecting a great lens, but at least expected better mechanics.Besides, the advertisement is very misleading. It is not from Canon."
4,Great item,I bought this so I can use my other lens on my digital camera. It works great and worth the money spent.
1,did not work,"the adapter fastened to the lens just fine. But, no amount of fiddling would get it to attach to the camera. I sent it back for a refund"
4,Louie Austen - Hoping,"Louie Austen's Rat-Pack vocals go in for another dancefloor treatment on his HOPING single. While the original has a romantic, upbeat feel, the various remixers put their own spin on the track while maintaining a steady 4/4 beat. But what can you expect from a track that has lyrics basically begging you to dance? Herbert does a slightly darker and more mysterious mix, keeping the strings to a minimum. The Martini Bros., on the other hand, highlight the strings in a slightly noisier mix. Jimi Tenor does more of that lounge-jazz he's become famous for, while Filippo Moscatello heads straight for the floor with an Italo-disco bassline. Sugar B's mix doesn't really differ from the original too much, except for some reverb effects. Definitely a single for the househeads."
1,"Hugo Zuleta. Barranquilla, Colombia.",I paid for a complete edition of 1272 pages and received a Volume 2 with 587. What's happened? I feel cheated and I feel cheated.
1,Copy Product,"I receive a product form amazon but product it a copy itemDatabase Systems: An Application Oriented Approach, 2nd Edition (Compete Version)why???????????? i buy the item so very expensive."
1,Many better options available,"This item is poorly made and thus has poor reception, very hard to read the display despite being so brite it illuminates the whole room."
2,too bright,"The display is much too bright, even dimmed to the lowest setting. I felt like I was trying to sleep with a flashlight shining on me.The digital tuner works great though. I moved this radio to my kitchen and bought a new, less-bright alarm clock."
4,Some interesting and varied remixes here - solid overall,"More like 3.75 stars. Like most remix albums, you'll find some gems and some (relative) duds on here. But some sensational reworkings of Vadim's famous minimalism make this album a worthy purchase as long as you're prepared to hit the Next button every once in a while. But the best tracks are easily 5 star material, and may be worth the price alone. Some of the standout tracks are by Herbaliser, DJ Krush and Silent Poets."
2,Could have been a lot better,"Started out interesting, an alien prince. Check. Then the prince meets a human. Check. When the ship arrives with the elders, that's when it really lost interest for me. So, I skipped ahead, hoping it would regain my interest. But to no avail. The story lacked enough depth to carry it through, unless you're looking for a very superficial story.Sunny, Kresley Cole are a lot better than this book.."
5,So happy to find this,This book is no longer in print. We have the boy verision and my daughter had been wanting the girl. I was very happy to find it. I was in great shape and she loves it.
3,Deep Callus,"This is a good product for callus feet on the top, but not for deep down spot callus. It does not get the the center of deep down callus. I was hoping I could use this to stop the deep down callus from coming back, but, it is only useful for heels, and toes."
2,not too helpful,Use Natural Sierra Pumice Stone instead. It is cheap and more efficient. I used Be Natural Unscented Callus Eliminator first and saw some improvement of my callus. My podiatrist advised me to use simple pumice stone instead. I tried and it worked much better.
2,What's the hype here?,"I purchased this product based on a review I read and have not been impressed. If it is a miracle product ... then I must have received a defective batch. And it ships directly from the manufacturer, so you have to pay additional shipping. I have over-the-counter products that work better."
5,Great value.,Was so excited to get this product and try out. I did use rubber gloves as suggested from other reviews. I don't think I put enough product on my feet so next time I will use more and see how it works. I followed the directions and after removing the product I rinsed and used a callus file to remove the callus. It worked beautifully. I would have preferred a little more of the callus to be removed so next time I will use more product. This is worth the time and money.
5,A MUST HAVE FOR PRETTY FEET!,"This stuff works! I tried it once at a salon, where this extra service comes at a $5-10 additional charge depending where you go, and it does wonders for removing dry skin from heels. The product pays for itself in one use! My husband has terrible man-feet and this was a great way to get rid of all the hardened scaly skin and start fresh with some good at home foot care. I highly recommend this product to keep your feet looking pretty all year long."
3,A Callous Callus Remover,"This eliminator does a good job with a partially removed callus that has been prepped by Dr. Scholls. However, it doesn't touch a hard callus that probably requires the help of a podiatrist."
2,"Derivative, but a decent way to kill a couple of hours.","Bunshinsaba (Byeong-ki Ahn, 2004)Mediocre and derivative Korean horror flick that draws on years of better work without offering anything new or interesting to the mix. Yu-jin (Se-eun Lee) and her mother move back to her mother's old village. In true outsider fashion, the local kids gang up on her, and she places a curse on the four ringleaders with a ouija board. (Does this sound familiar?) They start to die off, and Yu-jin has to figure out what she's done, and how to undo it, with the help of a couple of sympathetic teachers. It's not a terrible way to kill an hour and a half, because it has the usual Asian-horror-film atmosphere in spades, but if you grab another Tartan Asia Extreme flick off the shelf at random, you've got a pretty good chance of finding something scarier/more interesting/more original/etc. **"
4,helpful but a bit redundant,"I found this book to be very helpful in setting the groundwork for parenting my ""strong-willed"" three year old. The book helped me to understand that I don't have bad parenting skills, they are just more geared toward a compliant childs needs than one who needs stronger boundaries.The one downfall of the book is that it can seem a bit redundant (maybe too many examples) and for this reason my husband isn't going to finish it."
5,"Methods work for my ""terrible"" two-year old!","I bought this book on cd so that I could absorb the information while sitting in traffic mornings on the way to the office. The information was well-organized and easy to understand. The methods are effective and simple to deploy! After a week of using the advice from the book, my two-year old daughter is much better behaved, and pushing limits less. I don't have to yell, or expend a whole lot of energy and it's shocking how great she responds! Wish I had the time to write some examples, but the book's tecqniques center around being respectful when communicating, setting limits and following through with consequences immediately when the child is disobedient. I highly recommend this book!"
5,Read it and follow his plan,I highly recommend this book. I was doing everything wrong and I thought I was being a good parent. My four year old is much better behaved and parenting is easier for me now.
4,It's amazing!,"There's a lot of action in this movie. I like when Spike talks...it was really funny! I like that Debbie and Angelica meet each other, because they're alike...they're both mean and bossy. It was nice to see Angelica get bossed around for a change. I didn't think this movie was too scary. My brother and I really enjoyed this movie."
5,Rugrats & The Wild Thornberrys A winning nicktoon match.,"Since I seen the film two times like I did with the firsttwo back in the past I think that Paramount Pictures,Nickelodeon Movies & Klasky Csupo Inc.have finaly created a hit that will be remembered as one ofthe most top rated animated motion pictures for the nextcouple of years in the 21st century.I got to admit that filmhad the best musical numbers ever!and best of all it has S.T.Y.L.E."
3,beautifully detailed toy suitable for an older child,"This toy is very detailed and contains lots of very tiny pieces, wine goblets, weapons, mice, birds. It has every little accessory you could want, but the main problem is that everything is so tiny. Pieces are very easy to lose inside the ship or in your home. They are hard to manipulate because they are so small. The ship takes a long time to assemble with its sails and rigging. It is a beautiful toy with much to play with, but it's not a good toy for little ones. I bought it for my 4-year-old, and he likes it, but doesn't play with any of the little extras, only the cannon (which does not shoot cannon balls, they just sort of fall out). He isn't able to put the swords or goblets, etc., into the pirates' hands by himself. I think this would be a better toy for an older child, perhaps 8."
2,Not Made for a 4 year Old...Horrible Toy,"This was the most horrible toy..And no one else makes a pirate ship anymore. The rigging kept coming undone, and the sails kept falling off. The pieces are too tiny for a 4 year old to play with. He has enough trouble keeping track of his little people let alone 50 gold coins the size of beebees."
1,Avoid this device like the plague ....,"The DPG-503 is something you can do without. Trust me! It has an impressive feature set but is extremely unstable and has all types of issues. I am returning the unit after about 48 hours of troubleshooting ... not worth it! If it worked as advertised, I would give it a 4 or a 5."
4,Entering a Queer Culture,"As a newcomer into the rhelm of queer theory and also as a graduate student, I found this book highly interesting, sparking many topics useful for analysis,like Judith Butler, and controversy, like Gayle Rubin. Most of the essays captured the readers attention and urged for outside investigation for newcomers on issues like Stonewall, AIDS, and ACT UP. Adequate background information was given about queer cultures in general allowing ample understanding of such texts. While reading certain essays, though, there was a struggle to try and relate them to the rest of the text."
3,My 5 year old liked it anyway,"Someone claims to have raked 1/2 acre with this? I wonder how long that took? 2 days? This rake is very tiny. My daughter likes to play in the sand with it, and it is just the right size for that. It is not a full sized rake. The quality is okay, though."
2,Potential not reached.,"An interesting premise, if short on horror. Very few moments were scary.I wanted to like this movie more but the characters too often were stereotype and unrealistic even for the genre. I was disappointed."
3,Ryuichi Sakamoto - Anger / Grief,"Ryuichi Sakamoto, one of Japan's electronic music pioneers, has his modern classical tracks, Anger/Grief, worked over in a big way. How big? Well, Amon Tobin goes dark and spooky on ""Grief"", while Rare Force run ""Anger"" through some martial hip-hop. Talvin Singh inserts his trademark tabla `n' bass in ""Anger"" and Chocolate Weasel takes a different approach: it's a cacophonous din of horns and drums. The original ""Anger"" is also included -- it's interesting just to hear how different the remixes are."
5,Some people should not watch/review Miike films!,"If you are a moralistic bore, who was offended by Little Miss Sunshine (as apparently many were) DON'T watch this film.If you enjoy the early films of John Waters and enjoy being jolted and even disturbed by over the top violent humor, then I say 'what are you waiting for?'"
2,disturbing,"The most perverted, baseless,and sickest film I have ever seen.Necrophilia,mutilation, murder and son beating his mother and trashing the house I found particulary heinous. A film for almost no one.some perversons are slightly tolerable but this film has the ones mentioned-unacceptable.Add in a""scat"" scene this would be the sickest film in history!!!!"
5,speedo grab bag Female suit,I'm happy with the swimsuit. Sizing was somewhat difficult to understand. I like the front being lined.
4,More than Satisfactory,"Received my suit in 3 days. It was a nice black and grey background with some blue scroll work on the chest. Though unlined and with no padding in the cup area, it does not display too much breast definition since the cut of the suit is designed to flatten out. The tag said the retail price was $[...] so I felt like I got a good deal."
4,hungry for black metal warfare? get this !,"I must say this is not their best if compared to heaven shall burn which was mastepiece and nightwing which was even darker! this is sharply produced and fits in with the concept well, chaos from the beginning to the end, hail MarduK ! ohDimmu Borgir? Marduk rapes cradle of filth and dimmu burgers !"
2,This is pretty repetative,"These songs sound the same no matter how you look at it. It just get so boring that I use the cd as a coaster to put my beer onto. Keep the drummer, lose the band."
3,Display it. Don't use it.,"You can test this one before taking it out of the package and see right away there's only imperceptible mouth movement (unless you grab him around the throat and pull hard). Hair began coming out during the unpacking process.As a ventriloquist dummy, this Bozo makes a great shelf display. For actual basic functionality, you're better off with a different product."
1,fragile equipment,I bought this ball for my 9-year old son to practice his pitching. The ball went dead after 5 throws. The ball had scuff marks next to the digital readout area and apparently the impact caused the readout to malfunction. Very disappointing....
1,Batter's Box Customer Service,"I placed an order with The Batter's Box the first week of August. Delivery date was supposed to be the middle of August, and on that date they sent me an email saying that the product would be delayed about two weeks. 4 weeks later I still had not received my product, so I emailed them. After a week of waiting for a response that was never received I called the company. I was told that no one there could help me because only the owner could sign into the Amazon account, and he was at church at 7:00 pm on a monday night. I asked if he could return my call, and instead of calling me to let me know what was going on with my order the owner had decided to cancel it. Overall I would not recommend anyone buy from this seller. He has very poor customer service!!!"
4,Seems to have killed the grubs...,"Seems to have killed some or most of my grass eating grubs. I had spread this product down before a long thunderstorm and even watered it in over 2 days. Although, I still found a few white grubs in the grass, the grubs stopped eating my grass after the application."
2,Not Alvin's best,Covers of old songs that is now way over done. And these are average at best versions. (I really dislike his California Bloodlines)
2,There are a few.....,"really good tracks on this compilation. But, I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,poor imitation of the real kimba,"the soundtrack and voices aren't the origional kimba. I got kimba, ""trials of a jungle king"" and it did have the origional voices. This tape would be a dissapointment to anyone who remembers the origional kimba."
5,as funny as ever,"When I was younger, approx. 15 or 16 I worked at a pizza parlor. They played these old movies up on the wall for the customers to watch as they ate their pizza. I would sit and watch people laughing as they ate, and I would love it. Well... these movies are STILL that funny today. My kids even love to watch them, for thats who I bought them for. Between Mr. Chaplin and Mr. Keaton my kids will laugh for hours. This set is WELL worth the money... especially for as many hours of movie shorts there are per disc. A good buy to sit and enjoy some quiet time with your family. Buy, laugh, and enjoy!!!"
2,Uncomfortable,I would not recommend this product. But you get what you pay for. Uncomfortable to sleep on and the threading has already starting to loosen after two weeks of purchase. All you feel are springs no support of cushion.
2,short,"This futon cover was so short that my daughter struggled to put it on, only to find out that it was so tight the futon mattress would not bend! The fabric is thin and cheap. Back it goes; what a disappointment."
2,"Nice, but NOT three sided zipper!","I probably should have read the reviews before purchasing this cover. Although I felt that the quality was nice enough, the futon cover did not have a zipper on three sides as advertised. This may not matter with thin futon mattresses, but ours if fairly thick. We tried to put the cover on, but thought that it was going to rip from our efforts. We ended up returning it, and getting a similar style cover from another vendor.[...]"
1,Flimsy and poorly made,"I was disappointed when I opened the package, as the futon cover looked and felt cheap and flimsy. There were loose ends of cotton at the edges and it was clear that the product was badly made. Then I went to put the cover on my futon and the zipper broke... obviously I sent it back. I now have a different futon cover from West Elm that is a LOT nicer and is more what I was looking for in the first place, but it also cost a whole lot more. :( Just be aware that you get what you pay for here (or maybe less...)"
2,ugly!!,"I order the brown, and the color is ugly. The material is thin, probably will wear out quickly.Doesn't look anything like the picture.Waste of money"
1,Highly disappointed!,The item came apart in the wash before it was ever used. There is insufficient edge margin at the seams.
3,VERY tricky!,"I just tried it out and I could not follow the steps very well and it looks so fun! I guess I thought I could dance :-/ :-P I realize that some reviewers mentioned that the video may be hard to follow, but I figured I would try it anyway because in other reviews, alot of people had said that the instructor broke down the steps. But it's like she does it for a second. I'm still trying to figure out the steps and moves and the next thing I know, they're gyrating and twisting 10x faster. I don't understand why they couldn't build up a little slower. On the plus side, it did make me sweat and got my heartrate up. Well, I won't give up. I guess I just have to practice, after all that's what real dancers do anyway, LOTS of practice. Plus, maybe I am just so used to doing my cardio workout.(Crunch Cardio sculpt - I recommend it!) I found myself doing steps from Cardio sculpt instead of the dance steps that I was trying to do!I will stick with it and do my best."
3,"Fun, good moves, but not really a workout","This dvd is really fun to do and the moves are pretty decent, but I wish it was more of a cardio workout. I would give it 5 stars if it at least got me breathing hard. Marie is a good instructor and not overly cheerful like some others (although she does say things like ""stick your booty out!""). I like the steps, but they are way too easy and she spends too much time explaining some of them at half-time. There is also way to much marching in between, which is another reason you don't get as much of a workout. Although sometimes the marching is more of a workout than the dance steps.Even though it isn't really a workout, I still do it occasionally on light days or as a warm-up to another dvd. I wish Marie would put out another dvd that was more advanced -- I would buy it for sure."
4,"Fun, simple workout","Marie is a great instructor - her cues are right on target and she is upbeat without being annoying. The dance moves are fun. Overall I really like this workout, but it only gets 4 stars because I tend to watch the clock more with this DVD than with my other workouts. The moves can get a bit repetitive at times."
2,Crunch Cardio Dance Blast,"This is only good for people who already know how to do professional dance moves. It went very quickly, and did not give much time to learn the moves before it went on to the next thing. Only do this if you are VERY coordinated and know how to dance well."
4,Fast and Fun,"I ordered this DVD to help me loose weight after the birth of my twins. Well it seems really fast paced to me. I had a hard time keeping up and doing the moves the first couple of times. But it was a lot of fun and a good workout so I paused the dvd after every new move sequence and I practiced until I felt coordinated enough to keep up with them, I even wrote it down. Now I have it memorized and I can keep up and have fun.."
3,A Daily Dose,"I really enjoyed this workout for two reasons: it's fun and it helped me lose the 5 pounds I needed to loose to get into my wedding dress. I only did this workout for a month, and along with eating better I lost the weight I needed. The instructor has a nice personality and is in tune with the people using the DVD at home. She does some nice dance moves, and shows and tells you how to do them step by step. If you're looking for a video that will help you build muscle and burn lots of fat, this video may not be for you. On the other hand, if you love to dance and want to keep up with a moderate daily excercise for your health, this video is an excellent choice."
2,This United American Video Issue Is In Long Play Mode,"This VHS issue is a poor quality issue in long play mode. The long play issue uses 2/3 less tape, but greatly reduces the quality of the transfer. I do not understand why this is done. The manufacturing savings in using less tape can be only a few cents. The tape runs 52 minutes in black and white, not color as indicated by Amazon.This movie was made in 1937. It stars the following:Gene Autry as Gene AutryPolly Rowles as Sandra KnightUla Love as Sylvia ParkerRuth Bacon as Peggy SnowJane Hunt as Jane HiltonWestern (Bordentown 332/1)"
3,Great service!,"I got great service. However, this is an out-of-date version of the textbook I needed, so I had to buy the updated version. Buyer beware!"
2,There Was A Reason These Were Never Released Before,I read the other reviews and got so excited about the prospect of hearing the so-called lost classics that were never released. But this collection of songs is definitely second-rate compared to the real Motown classics we are all familiar with.My opinion is that the songwriting is the primary reason that these songs don't stack up to the classic Motown hits. I think this is confirmed because the Funk Brothers do some odd instrument arrangements on a lot of these songs that you don't hear on the known classics...and I think that is because they were trying to spice up the weak songwriting to make them sound more interesting.There was a reason these were never released before: there are no hits on this collection. Berry Gordy knew what he was doing.This is for completists and collectors only.
3,Good but ----loses suction quickly,"This has to be the cleaner than annoying Englishman on t-v is always talking about when he complains that the filters on poorly designed vacuums clog easily, causing them to lose suction power. When the dirt cup is empty and the filters new or freshly cleaned, this cleaner is outstanding. But I must clean out a nearly empty dirt cup and clean the filters thoroughly almost every time I use it to vacuum about only 800 square feet of carpet. It's okay, but certainly less useful than I had anticipated. This is a high maintenance appliance."
1,Worst vacuum ever.,"I needed a vacuum and bought this one. Mistake! From day one it was spitting stuff out from underneath, no matter which carpet setting I used. Maybe it works better with shaggier carpet, but on mine it was just disgusting. Did they even test it? Who would bother using this thing? I'll never buy a Hoover again. It never wants to return to an upright state--I get some weird resistance from the spring in the hinge."
2,Not for pets,If you have dogs do not buy because you will be buying more filters than you would be buying bags for a different product.
5,getting more specific...,"I have yet to read Manga! Manga!- this was what I was able to get my hands on first, but with enough background info, it is a great read. And as Schodt says in his intro, one can read Dreamland without Manga!Manga! but it is meant to be a sequel of sorts. The most useful part of the book, as a researcher, was the section with descriptions of individual artists and their works. Basically, Schodt takes you through the world around manga, the different kinds of publications, then the individual artists within those publications, and then on top of that, leaves you with some thoughts on manga in the context of art and literature in both Japan and the US. The most useful part of the book is in the back where Schodt offers some helpful resources for the English reader of manga as well as internet resources (although, no fault of the author, many of these sites are changing all the time!). All in all, a worthwhile read for many different purposes."
4,Highly informative but out-of-date,"I would highly recommend this book for all manga lovers. It provides a run-down of all the popular manga magazines in Japan, Japanese manga culture, and manga's place in society, as well as outlines of many famous and less-famous mangaka (manga writers) of interest.Frederik Schodt is a god of manga translation, and his writings are extremely interesting, especially with regard to Tezuka Osamu.Unfortunately, this book is rather old and it shows. The information regarding anime/manga fandom in the USA and internet resources is woefully out-of-date (fandom has exploded since the book was written, and the internet has obviously changed a ton even over the past few years), and some of the manga magazines Schodt discusses are not in print any more.Even so, I would recommend this book for those with a solid grounding in manga or a deep interest in manga magazines/manga culture IN JAPAN."
3,Bon Jovi rocks!,"This is the fourth Bon Jovi's album. The tittle is very good, a nice tribute to New Jersey, the place where they were born.There are wonderful ballads, as ""Living in Sin"", ""I'll Be There For you"" and ""Wild Is The Wind"".""Ride Cowboy Ride"" is a little song, but even so it's a beautiful song. It's one of my faves in this album. ""Love For Sale"" is very funny too, with their acoustic guitars.""Blood on Blood"" is my favourite too. Musically it sounds very good, and the lyrics are wonderful, talking `bout the time when you are teen and you are learning things not so good, but things that made part of our own lives. This is a good song for you think about your life, your childhood, the wonder years that will never come back.""Lay Your Hands On Me"", ""Bad Medicine"" and ""Born To Be My Baby"" are great hard rock songs. You have to check these on! Everybody that likes rock and roll has to have this album on his CD's collection!Bon Jovi rocks forever! They are coming back with BOUNCE!"
5,On the money she could not tell it more better,"Robin Macnaughton, book on how to seduce any man in the zodiac is out of this world & on the money when she is talking about understand men and how thay think..... & even beter how to keep them, how to have them....."
1,Not worth the money.,"The ideas in the book are cute, but the materials leave A LOT to be desired. One of the punches in our set did not work and another broke quickly. My daughter received this as a gift, and the giver wasted her money!"
4,great little pouch,it has just the right amount of padding and closes nicely to protect the lens from falling out. I wish more border colors were available...
4,Nothing fancy and that is okay by me,"These are good wristbands suitable for most activities from rocking out to sports & hiking. I found the color to be accurate and they fit well. Nothing fancy... no logos or hi-tech materials, just good old school wrist bands."
2,Complete? well...,"I am about to set up an Internet Radio Station at my university and found this book on Amazon.com. The title suggests that this book is all one needs to know (for me, the words ""Complete"" and ""Manual"" suggest this. While the thin volume is a quick and easy read (less than the length of a Toyota oil change), it really doesn't contain much specific information, especially for the cost. Also, as a college professor, I was turned off by the frequent mechanical errors (including missing words) in the writing.The book is a helpful introduction to the topic, and contains a potentially useful bibliography, but..the price is too steep for a spiral bound book with so little specific info."
2,all weather dog boots,"It took awhile to figure out how to get the boots to stay on my bichon. The front feet boots came loose easily. His right foot turns outward and the boot would keep getting loose on this foot. I could not get the boot to stay on longer than ten minutes. I was often adjusting it every five minutes or less. I did get the left foot boot to stay on longer. I am reasonably sure that I put these boots on correctly and tightened the strap as tight as I could. THE BIGGER PROBLEM WAS THE WEAR. After an hour walk the toes of his front foot boots showed wear along the seam line. The boots were worn in a combination of ice, asphalt and some snow."
3,muttluk booties,"My dog hates them. He refuses to walk in them. They slip and turn on his paws. The good thing is that they do keep his paws dry when I do get him to walk in them. My suggustion is to make sure you get the right size, they seem to run a little big."
4,"Beautiful, Fulfilling Tarot Set","I absolutely love this tarot set! The cards are wonderful and have gorgeous art with eye-catching black borders against gem-like colors. The best thing I noticed about it was the book, however. The book gives some excellent exercises to get the beginner to Tarot familiar and working with their deck. A beautiful deck with a helpful book. The only downside to it was that the actual book card descriptions weren't all that in-depth, however, the exercises provided help to familiarize the reader with their cards anyway! Recommended!"
2,Not for the regular traveler...,"If you rarely travel, then one or two pages of this pad may come in handy. If you travel regularly, then you probably have it down to a science. Cute idea to include (one page) with a ""Bon Voyage"" gift, but beyond that can't quite figure out what to do with mine. You see, I rarely travel. The next time I go away I will use one of the checklists, but there will be more left than I will ever use."
1,Waste of time and money...,I purchased this camera for my daughter and she was so happy until she tried to take pictures. It was extremely difficult to understand and the camera wouldn't even take pictures unless you were outside in the brightest sun. We didn't even get as far as putting any of the pictures on the computer. I threw it away within the month.
1,Better get a good one!,Do not waste your time. I had to format my desktop hard drive because of this cd installation camera!!!. Ugly and poor pictures. I bought this for my niece as a xmas gift and she was excited at first later everything turned in a problem trying to get pictures from the camera. Save money and buy a good one.
3,"Comprehensive subjects covered; however, nothing new or anything that a staffing professional hasn't practiced or heard before.","Book is informative; however, from my perspective, most of the materials contains information that most staffing leaders already know or have already practiced. There are some chapters that may give you a different perspective on certain subjects but overall it's like reading the articles on ERE. I will say that some of the topics are very specific to unique industries or topics; therefore, if you are a recruiter wanting to advance into management or a manager with limited exposure or experience it's a good book to learn of good practices that work for companies. (remember there isn't a one size fits all approach to recruiting so read for knowledge not to take practices of other companies so you can replicate them for your business)"
4,Great GPS system,"This little device has helped me to stay on course, even when I make a wrong turn. Great technology."
2,A dangerous GPS,"The StreetPilot C530 is a model that does not provide spoken directions. This means the user must watch the screen while driving, in order to be aware of when and where to turn. This procedure can be very dangerous. It is much better to pay a few dollars more for a C550 and get a model that talks."
5,Garmin StreetPilot c530 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator,"Excellent condition and new in the box. Arrived a few days later with no problems. Would recommend a refurbished unit to anyone that wants to save money. This was the third time I have purchased this unit (For myself, for a friend, and now for my father) and there has been no issues with any of them."
4,Great entry level gps,Garmin StreetPilot c530 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorBought this as a birthday gift for my wife. She's not exactly a gadget guru but had this up and running in just a few minutes. We haven't tried it out of town yet but it gives accurate directions here at home and is very easy to use. Would be nice if it had an a/c charger.
2,Good Product But Bad Apple,"I received the product for a trip during Christmas time but 30 minutes after we started our trip the screen said low battery and I had it plugged into my cigarette lighter along with my satellite radio and it was working so I know that the power source was working, needless to say we were disappointed but upon getting back home I sent the product back and got satisfaction."
5,User friendly and great for those who want GPS only,"Got this unit recently and used it during trip from LA to Vegas. We had breakdown on I-15 just before Baker..this unit was very helpful to pinpoint the location of breakdown in order to get some help from AAA(It gave distance and phone no of the nearest tow stations in Baker, CA by which i was able to find my location) since there was no mile marker or call box near by... Also it showed me nearest Discount tire store in Vegas where I went got the new tires.I would recommend this unit for those who want just a GPS and do not require bell & whistles like MP3 player, bluetooth etc etc."
2,Great When It Works!,I received this item for a Christmas present. It was great until the last week. It has been cutting off and on randomly and now it has completely stopped working. I am in the process of contacting Amazon and Garmin to see if anything can be done.
1,Motorhead fans BEWARE,This is not the one with the Motorhead soundtrack. Do not buy this unless you want to lend Amazon.com the cost of the item for a few weeks while they process the return. It is NOT the Eat the Rich you are looking for.
4,Great Workout.,"When I try a new work out video, I'm looking for something that will make me sweat and get in a good heart pumping workout. This video did just that. Although it didn't have the bells and whistles of other workout videos, it gives a good workout and that's what my concern is. I'm short on time and this video packed a good little punch. I can even shorten it by leaving out any of the segments if I want and its a change from the kick boxing videos that I normally do."
1,Lost in the Clouds,"If you are looking for any kind of practical advice, you won't find it here. The author spends half the book telling us why arhitects can't design baths. The rest of the book is spent potificating on vague notions of the bath experience. The pictures suggest the ulitimate bathing experience comes from various outdoor, earthy, natural baths. If you have a desire to create a mud-pit bath in your backyard, read this book. Otherwise, forget it."
5,How To Write A Hit Song,"I've been writing songs for twenty-two years with the usual confusion and heartbreak. But THIS book pulled it all together for me. I just got three big cuts and I owe it all to Molly Leiken's ""How To Write A Hit Song.""Bravo."
4,Thinking Christmas in August,"Even as good as Amazon is, I can't ever remember seeing 600 thread count king size sheets for $30 with super saving. You can barely find 250 thread count sheets at that price. My bachelor brother has a standard mattress, not a pillow top, so I know these will fit. He depends on his sister to keep his linens up to date; it's just not something he bothers with. From the other reviews, I will tell him to wash them twice before he puts them on the bed so that they are hopefully softer. I went with the white, and in the package, they appear very nice. I will revisit this review after Christmas to give his opinion of the sheets. At the sale price with free shipping and without having an oversized mattress, it's definitely worth a tryout. April 15, 2008 update: Okay, now that my brother has had the opportunity to use these sheets from Christmas, he loves them and says the quality is first rate."
3,Couldn't finish watching it......,"Took a few tries for the dvd player to read movie and when it finally did it stop 10 minutes in, then we took it out and played it again and it stopped 45 minutes into the movie, again took out and put back in and it still stops close to the finish...we haven't been able to finish the and we wont until we buy another one...disapointed."
3,Rock Haven,"Rock HavenThe story line is interesting but the movie seemed a bit drawn out... just too slow. The DVD is an excellent teaching tool for Gay-Straight Alliances in schools and for parents too. Sean Hoagland played excellently, however I am concerned about the role played by Owen Alabado. The message sent out is that all gay men are out to seduce and convert heterosexual men into homosexuality (irrispective of whether one party was struggling making sense of his sexuality). I believe that the author should have had this relationship develop as a natural progression. In a way the movie sends out a message that being gay is a choice. Who would want to be gay in a hostile heterosexual world if homosexuality was a choice? I give credit to the minister who nreflected upon what it means to be homosexual from a Christian perspective. I thought his view and guidance was refreshing and worldly wise."
1,PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!,"I cannot let you spend money on this movie! Yes, the content is relevant to many homosexuals, but SO MUCH MORE could have been done with this movie - like scenes that actually last for more than 30 seconds!! I can count on one hand the number of scenes that actually last more than 2 minutes. There's not enough time to really invest in any of the characters, which is sad because you should really want to! Character development is seriously lacking in this flick, not to mention character talent! The actors are HORRIBLE! The one positive thing about this movie is the gratuitous nudity in one scene. Otherwise, it was a waste of my money and time."
4,Enjoyable Predictability,"I REALLY REALLY loved this book. I looked at it a couple of times before I bought it and was not disappointed at all. Some of it was predictable, but in an enjoyable way. I may have found it predictable because I have read ALL of Eva Ibbotson's books. I think that, if you enjoy other cinderella-princess-y books(though this isn't either; it just brings those tales to mind) then you will enjoy ""A Secret Countess"" (Previously published as ""A Countess Below Stairs"") by Eva Ibbotson"
4,Gets kids started,DJ's Choice More Kids FunGreat sounds & songs for young kids to learn & have fun ... put it on a CD & the kids can listen & sing over & over to theur heart's content
2,Poor quality tape and NOT a beginners guide.,"Hamill is clearly an amateur. Says next to nothing about tuning. Heavy distortion of both audio and video early in tape, improving slightly later.You get what you pay for, in this case, not much.Hamill spends time at beginning having student writing names of parts in the accompanying book that he could have spent teaching tuning. Not a BEGINNERS tape, since he assumes some pre-existing knowledge of the guitar.You can learn something from this tape, but NOT for real beginners.""Learning guitars for Dummies"", Jon Chappell is better."
2,"Good, but not great.","This game has realistic naval and vessel controls according to the proper vessel and the year of construction, but it tends to be slower and there aren't as many options as I had hoped. The only game that has met my match was a PC game I ordered through the internet last year called Virtual Sailor 7.0. Unfortunately I also have a new computer too, because that game corrupted my PC. The weather, vessel and other functions on that game were fantastic. Nothing has come close to it."
2,Be sure before you buy,"These shoes are off white in color and seem to be made for a wider foot. The cost of shipping and return shipping is almost as much as the shoes, so be sure before you buy."
5,Great Movie!,"Having just come from winning first place in our sons Pine Car Derby race, my husband (an avid 'helper' of the pine car derby creation), thought it would be a hoot to get this movie. It didn't disappoint. It was cute, funny, and had a great twist to it. Definitely recommend to not only to Scouts, but everyone."
1,Ordered a Curtis - Got a Sylvania,"I ordered the mini-system since it was similar to one I already had. What I received was a ""ringer"" that was nothing like what I had. My effort to return it within 30 days of the purchase has been unsuccessful since the vendor has chosen to ignore my e-mail inquiry."
5,Invisible Empire,This is instrumental for the understanding of the operations of our current administration.Gives you insight in line with bibllical belifs. A must for every American citizen.
5,Excellent study of how logos are developed.,"Buy this book! This is a terrific resource for any designer, art director or student wanting to learn more about how a logo or brand evolves from the drawing board to the billboard.I'm making this required reading for my designers!"
2,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"First of all the barrel is not the same as picture. I got it because you couldn't see any writing on the barrel and it looked nice, but when i got it there was writing on it in bright grey letter. also when you put it on the gun the word tippmann is upside down. Second.... amazon, you really should list the bore size, cause this must be the smallest size out there. it took me two shots to get one ball out. unless you use the smallest balls you can find, don't waste your money, i sent mine back and went to my local paintball store and bought a REDZ 2 piece pepperstick.... great barrel and the bore size is one one the biggest you will find at .689. hope this helps"
5,Good value for the price,Well packaged. No missing parts. Appears to be well built. Wiring instructions were simple and easy to follow. Good quality finish on motor. I would recommend this motor -- I used it as a replacement motor on a jointer.
1,Dissatisfied with product,I am very Dissatisfied with this company. Quality was poor. The costume was scratchy. I tried to return it and was denied. They stated that they have a 7 day return policy. I think 7 days is very unreasonable for mail order.
4,I like them but my dog does not!,I like these but sometimes they fall off of my dog's feet and I'm not sure how tight I shoudl make the velcro. My dog hates them and walks weird in them but then got used to them in the cold. Better than frost bite when he wants a walk in Minnesota's winter.
3,Breezily sweet,"The Bottom Line:Keri Russell is cute and spunky and Nathan Fillion is adorably awkward as the object of her affection, so it's rather a shame when the movie falls back on dumb stock characters like Keri Russell's selfish pig of a husband (ever notice how many attractive, smart, and nice women in movies are dating complete jerks?) and doesn't try for anything greater than a fairly standard, albeit rather successful, romantic comedy formula; ultimately Waitress is as sweet as the pie the plot focuses on, but not very filling.2.5/4"
2,"Check, please","If this movie were a pie, I'd probably leave quite a bit of it on my plate. Set in that netherworld that is Hollywood's conception of the Deep South, 'Waitress' mixes up melodrama, comedy, women's empowerment fiction and then slathers on a bit more melodrama. Some of it works, a lot doesn't, especially the trendy up-with-single motherhood message at the end. Does a character like Earl seem like he'd just fade into the background? A more realistic ending would have been shot at a graveyard. There's also some seriously hammy acting brought to you by Cheryl Hines via Mel's Diner. High points are Keri Russell's nicely nuanced performance and Andy Griffith as a cranky patron. Pleasant, but forgettable and overly starchy."
5,Glad to have in my collection,"Lately I've been ""addicted"" to the bargain movie bins at Walgreens and Wal-Mart. $4-5 for a movie I can watch over and over, only a bit more than it costs to rent. Anyway, I found Waitress and snatched it up. I first watched this some years ago and felt like seeing it again. I do think it is a ""feel good"" movie, although some reviewers disagree. Others said it is full of cliches. Well, real life is full of cliches! It's a quirky movie. I think it has enough real-life type scenarios to be believable, with a bit of only-in-the-movies stuff (like getting a fat check from a diner customer) to make it a MOVIE. It did make me want to eat pie. I think this would be fun to watch with someone and have some pie, up the fun factor."
4,Good Movie,"This movie is good. It's basically about a waitress, Jenna, that bakes these excellent pies, but has a abusive husband and wishes to leave him. She finds herself pregnant. Then she starts having an affair with her OB/GYN. She is saving money to enter a pie contest, but her husband finds the money as she has it hidden in the house. Anyways she does manage to get the money she needs and leaves her husband and everything works out and she opens her own pie place. It is a really cute movie. If you are looking for a movie that everything ends happily this could be the movie that you are looking for. I wasn't sure if I was going to be glad I bought the movie or not, but I am glad that I did."
3,"It's not that I wouldn't recommend it, but","every time I was enjoying the movie that idiot husband character reentered the picture and for crying out loud did he have to be the complete stereotype of the psycho husband? The doctor too was w/o much depth. If not for Andy Griffith's character, I would have assumed that the writer simply hated men. I'm only glad that I could watch this at home so that I could fast forward the husband's scenes and take an occasional break.Keri Russell, though, can easily carry a movie and I enjoyed the pie metaphors of life. Unfortunately, the movie suffered from having male actors in the two main roles who are simply t.v. types (I'm guessing, I have no idea what their other roles have been). Too bad Andy Griffith could not have schooled them on the finer points of acting, but I'm guessing that he did his shots and left."
3,Dissapointing,"I'm a big Keri Russell fan but this film was really dissapointing. It's too bad because it was a good idea, there just was no good dialogue, drama, screenplay or intensity of any kind. Granted it's not supposed to be an intense movie but rather more of a ""feel good"" uplifting, family type film. But it really was none of those either. The lack of thematic continuity, good dialogue and dramatic story line just make this film fail big time. Sorry Keri! August Rush was better than this but it had it's flaws as well. A good Keri Russell film is ironically one produced not for theaters but for television called ""The Lottery""; that's worth seeing, Waitress however is just barely worth seeing."
5,Perfect replacement in old Craftsman table saw,"When the original motor of my Craftsman saw expired after 43 years, this Grizzly motor fit right in with no modifications other than the electrical cord. Being totally enclosed, I expect it to last even longer than the original. I'm a totally satisfied customer!"
5,Definately worth reading if you are open-minded,"This book takes a look at our culture, our beliefs and our religions. It challenges a lot of our ""assumed"" thinking and forces us to see things in a new way.I found it fascinating and it changed me forever."
5,"perfect if you ""don't have time"" to exercise","I'm always rushing to get out the door to go to work in the morning. Knowing that it takes only 12 minutes to get a GREAT abs, buns or thighs workout means I'm more likely to commit the time if I'm in a hurry. PLUS:- Kathy is not annoying at all, unlike some video fitness instructors (in fact, she's very likeable)- you can do the workout in work clothes, since the movements are small and you don't get that sweaty- it really works! you wake up the next day definitely feeling your muscles!"
3,Great body sculpting exercises,"This is a great video for muscle toning. It is designed to work specific body parts in twelve minute increments. The nice thing is you don't have to do the whole video at once if you don't have time to work all three body parts. There is no aerobics though. Kathy Ireland is a very motivational instructor, but sometimes the others working out with her can be annoying. You'll be sore the next day."
4,Great and action packed game,"This game has revolutionized vampire games. Your basicly this half vampire half human chick who loves to dice people apart or shoot at them from affar. You can suck there blood to regain health, and use 4 different veiws of your surroundings. If you ever get bored of the game(which I highly doubt)you can just kick back and star at the main chick, who is very hot. I couldnt find any problem with this game, its really good, check it out. Also if your looking for a good shoot'em up game, check out Dino Crisis 3.im out"
2,Blood Omen II is better.,"This is one of the few X-box titles I got rid of before completing the game. It just isn't worth a lot of play-time when there are many, many, more well made interesting games than this one. I guess I should be more specific.Graphics - mediocre. Monsters, buildings etc. appear very two dimensional. BloodRayne looks hot in a skin-tight cat-suit, but that is intersesting for about 10 minutes.Gameplay - mediocre to poor. Method of jumping, shooting, changing weapons is unatural and awkward.Story - goofy. That about sums it up.I definately would not buy this game. As a rental, may be fun for a couple of days."
5,blood rayne,thank you for speedy shipment and great service. oh also thank you for helping me recover my refund for the xbox game grand theft auto (san andreas) which i never recieved.
5,Quality paper,"This paper makes some really incredible pictures. No grainy appearances, but beautifully defined images. Used it to put together a small keepsake photo album, and it turned out great"
2,"Gene Autry ""Ride Ranger Ride""","Gene is a Texas Ranger working undercover as a scout for the Army. He's trying to stop the Comanches from looting a wagon train loaded down with ammunition. This is a well balanced plot, Smily Burnette as Forg and Kay Hughes as the love interest show the humor and softness for which Gene Autry Movies are Famious. As well old stars such as Max Terhune and Monte Blue provide the action. Champion the wounder horse makes riding look easy and very fast. Two and 1/2 Stars for this Republic Feature released in 1936, It should run 63m."
4,Book gets you programming right away,"The book does as it promises - it gets you (my son) programming right away. It presents the details of what the statements are doing slowly and not overwhelmingly. I didn't give it 5 stars because the accompanying CD for the compiler and the run environment didn't load right (and seemed primitive - have to load/run from a DOS prompt???). HOWEVER, we simply went to Microsoft's site and downloaded the FREE Visual C++ Express edition which makes compiling and running SIMPLE so you can focus on the programming. It even gives you an express version of SQLServer."
3,review title,"seller: took almost 2 weeks to arrivedidn't have the cdrom in it like it did when it was knewbook in general in good condition, no problem with conditionbook: as a beginner, I wish the explainations were a little more detailedI wish it was oriented more toward ""free"" software and linux"
2,Understandable but incorrect code!!!!,"I have brought this book as a beginners introduction to C++ and find that the examples of code provided inside are more often than not incorrect or missing code. The compiler that comes with this book requires medium to complex instructions involving DOS installation, hence i used my another compiler that i downloaded and found the examples to not work correctly. I've had to add my own snippets of code to make the examples work and even then they still do not work!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope this review helps!!!Don't buy this book!!"
5,great sound,I went to Australia this summer and heard this song on one of there music stations. was immediately hooked to Ben Lee's weird but appealing beats and sounds. This song is great and would reccomend it to anybody.
3,have not tried it yet,I ordered 8+ days before I needed it for a trip to India but it did not arrive until after I had left so that was disappointing.
3,Mystery man,"This story starts out as a compelling mystery. It ran out of steam about 3/4 of the way through, though, with too many characters that didn't move me. The mystery man in the center of the story is at the same time odd and heartbreaking as he searches for his wife and for meaning in his life."
5,you have to buy it!,I'll make this one short. Jordan Knight sings like an angel and his songs can be sweet and groovy at the same time...That's a MUST!
3,Jordan has come a long way since New Kids!!!,"I love the Song Give It To You!! It is so good. It's really different for him. I think his voice has gotten alot better now. it's more deep and soul ful . Also the lyrics are more grown up, gearing towards romance.It's a great song! Who ever doesn't have it allready please go out and get it!! you won't be disappointed!!!"
2,He could do better.....,Let's face it: Give it To You is a major let down. The song grates on my nerves...I hope this is not indicative of the quality of his album
5,I Love It,Jordan has finally proved to me that he has talent. Don't get me wrong I loved NKOTB. But even at 11 or 12 I was aware of the chessieness of the group. But Jordan definitely is the man. Give It to You is the bomb and I think it is way better than BSB or N'Sync. Peace
5,Frontier Brutality & Incredible Hardship,"Brumwell's is an excellent treatment of the tit-for-tat savagery that marked the Seven Years's War in America (the French & Indian War). The descriptions of the attacks by both sides were eye-opening. I appreciate unvarnished history - that which tries to be as factually correct as possible - legend/hero status be damned. White Deveil does not disappoint. For anyone interested in the French & Indian War, this is a must-read."
1,Not a great read.,"I bought this with hopes that it would provide additional insight into the French and Indian War. While it provided some information, I was disappointed immensely. I had just finished an excellent series by Alan Eckard that was lengthy, detailed, and engaging. The difference between those scholarly efforts and this book were like night and day. Much is glossed over. I found I could easily put this book down after just a few pages of reading. I feel like I am reading a book report from a student that needed to get a project credit. Others may care for this book - I do not."
5,Great First ABCs,"This is a sweet little first ABC's board book for the under-2 set. I first got this from the library (and later purchased from Amazon) just before my son turned two and wished I'd gotten in months earlier. He instantly loved it - lots of rich colors in the illustrations. Now, we focus on the words that he doesn't run across often and is learning from this book, like 'armadillo', 'jaguar', and 'iguana,' which is his favorite illustration - he asked, 'what dinosaur it is?' He's also fascinated by the picture of the xylophone and its mallet - it's fun explaining that - and 'unicorn' - to a 2 year old!"
3,A great performance marred by the poor recording quality,"A very stirring performance of La Traviata, highlighted by a great cast, Sutherland, Pavarotti, Milnes and Von Stade, all in their primes and in great voice. By 1970 Sutherland's interpretation of Violetta had grown tremendously from her first studio recording. Pavarotti and Milnes sing Alfredo and Germont beautifully. This CD sounds like a pirated recording and at times everything sounds like it is coming from the bottom of a barrel, with the audience's noices being front and center at times. Also, the recording level balance favors Pavarotti in his duets with Sutherland; his voice is crystal clear and I assume do to the immense size of her soprano, her voice is awash in distortion. If you can find it cheap, it may be worth it to either Sutherland or Pavarotti fans."
5,Good movies,"Hubby talked me into buying this two disc movie at Walmart. I didn't know what movies they were. After watching them at home I realized I've seen Teen Witch. It is a cutie movie. I like the dance in the locker room and the rap the shy girl sang to the rapping teens. This is a really good movie.I've never seen Heavenly Boy before buying it. I thought it was pretty good and funny. What a trip to be an angel for a young boy who ends up being the son of your ex girlfriend. And to top it off, he is your son all along. I think it would have been better if the boy found out the angel was his dad. But they didn't go that way."
2,disappointing at best,"After reading reviews for this book I was given it as a gift several months ago. I completed the two books I wanted to read before ""The Evidence Against Her"" and, when I finally got to pick it up I almost wish I never had. What a disappointment! I realize that it is a slow-paced novel that takes place in a much slower time. But it's slow to the point of being stuck in the mud. The character development drags. You kind of know where the characters are going but by the time they get there you have lost interest.I did plod along and finish the novel. The story is somewhat interesting but the pace and dialogue dragged a bit too much. Hey, there is no slower town than Mitford but I can't put Jan Karon's books down!"
2,"an improvement, but still not up to par","i'll try not to repeat what's already been said, and try to be brief. just so you know where i'm coming from, i really liked saw, liked saw 2, thought saw 3 was decent, thought saw iv was awful, and as for saw 5...i'm giving it two stars. if i could i'd give it more like 2.5. on one hand, it ties up a lot of things and is an improvement in some ways over some of the other sequels. on the other hand, at this point (5 movies into the franchise) things feel a bit tired and recycled. i didn't find the tension very high, i just found myself not caring that much about its increasingly convoluted story line or any of the characters. i felt like even the ""traps/puzzles"" weren't as inventive or entertaining as some in previous films.i won't be adding this one to my collection, but it wasn't a bad rental, and is worth watching if you've been following the saw films."
4,Great but short,"Bloodrayne was a cool game. The graphics were cool for the most part and the game was very bloody. It was so bloody that it was funny. Kind of like the movie Evil Dead 2. My only complaint was that it was rather short and the guys at the end of the stages were at times impossible. The codes were cool and Rayne's random comments (insults) were good.Overall I liked it, it was too short and has little replay value. I have to say that running through a group of Nazis in slow motion while blasting or slicing them to bits was really cool.Is it worth buying? I finished it in about 10 hours of playtime (one weekend). Even if a game is great, it is hard to buy a game that short. Rent it."
3,"Nazis, Blood, and Cleavage","Hard to see what the excitement is about. The graphics are nothing special. The game is rather shallow P>The controls are rather easy to pick up. You can use a variety of different views, such as aura view (looks similar to infrared), dilated perception (slow motion), and extended vision (zoom). Not much skill involved with the combat; it is more or less hack and slash.The theme of the game is raw violence combined with sensuality. I'm sure this alone is what is drawing most of the positive remarks."
3,Not all the hype that its worth,"I did try to get into this game, however, with sloppy controls and very cut and dry graphics i really thought it should have been better in my view. This game plays to much like Tomb Raider (control wise) and all the battles are either jerky or really bad. I would only get this game if your a huge fan of the Tomb Raider games (which i am not). Rent it, before you buy it."
4,"The Truth is sometimes hard, but essential. This is true.","If you're into finding out about how the scientific community in the USA really works, this book is a must read. This sad but true relevelation is an eye-opener revealing what Carl Sagan was really like and some of his darker and more less honorable doings."
1,Vista Blue Screen of Death,"I downloaded the latest Vista driver from SIIG and the install went smoothly. Unfortunately as soon as I tried to access the attached eSATA drive, Vista crashed with a BSOD. This occurred three more times at various times when accessing the drive. I finally did manage to copy files to the drive but only achieved 36MB/s instead of the expected 300MB/s.This occurred on a relatively new Lenovo Thinkpad T60 running Vista Ultimate. Either the driver is not quite ready for prime-time or the device is defective. Either way it is going back to the vendor."
4,Quite Good,"Very handy VA album of Pub Rock. Best for beginners or those who are struggling to get these kind of sound resources. It will take years to collect all these in the States. And it is now on CD. How can you complain ? If you are interested in British Beat, this one is a buy."
2,Is it really unbaised?,"Have only reviewed the detailed description of the Battle of Prokhorovka. In that account, Mr. Atge uses and references WWII era German propoganda accounts. The accuracy of these ""heroic"" accounts is suspect, the bias of them is clear. The purpose of these accounts were for the glorification of the Waffen SS. While Mr. Atge's work may be extensive, good history does require objectivity and an ability to analyze sources. Mr. Atge does have a social/political agenda that he is pursuing that probably influences his work. Mr. Atge's work should be used with extreme caution and only by people who are already well acquainted with the subject and aware of the biases that are often in these types of works."
4,Enjoyable summary of the lore of the Shore,"A surprisingly enjoyable history of the New Jersey Shore. An easy read that is worth picking up over and over. One point: the author says that the Twin Lights at Navesink Highlands sit on the highest point on the eastern seaboard. That's accuarte only for NJ seaboard; Staten Island NY is the highest point on the Atlantic, eastern seaboard -- from my history. Regardless, read this book; it's a joy."
3,good size and easy to assemble,"We bought this item to place on the ground and hold children's books. It is large enough for oversized books. I wouldn't call it a bargain, but it seems that anything cheaper out there is too flimsy. Not the most solid piece of furniture, and the texture on the surface tends to get dirty (but pretty easy to clean). appropriate for a children's room."
2,For the Price I was Underwhelmed,Great concept however it just wasn't anything special. I could have put together the same things with stuff I have laying around the house. There really isn't anything about the kit that I would keep...really disappointed because Learning Resources products are usually spot on.
5,Elizabeth Rocks--An Accessible Academic Work,"This is a beautifully researched, well written, thought provoking study of how one of the most interesting and powerful women in history negotiated gender restrictions during her 45 year reign. Not just a standard biography, ""Heart and Stomach"" looks carefully at Elizabeth's use of gender perceptions and roles to present herself as the great queen that she was. I've used this book as a text in the classroom and I've recommended it to readers and scholars who are interested in all things Renaissance and in women's history. It's always a hit!"
4,A good single,"This is a worthwhile purchase if you are a R.E.M. fan, especially if you like the song 'Suspicion'. The fourth track features 'Suspicion' recorded live in the studio. It is quite different than the 'UP' version with real drums (Joey Waronker does an excellent job). The vibes and xylophone really stand out and it has a menacing feel to it as compared to the creamy album version. 'Electrolite' is solid, just a straight ahead live version. The live version of 'Man on the Moon' dissapointed me. BJ Cole's steel guitar just sort of meanders and really doesn't mesh with the song. I much prefer the version on 'The Great Beyond' single."
2,Not so helpful,"I love breastfeeding but did not find this book helpful at all. There were specific concerns and questions I had about nursing twins and I didn't find the answers in a book that is all about.....nursing multiples. I found it pure propoganda and non-realistic. For instance, she advises to do rooming-in with your multiples even after a c-section. Can a mother get a bit of rest, after major surgery, before she goes home to probably very little sleep. I'm glad that I was able to avoid feeling guilty. After all, my babies are only getting breastmilk. Sure, I pump sometimes so I can have help or a rest or feed one while someone takes the other but a woman's got to know her limits."
1,"Different World, but bad enough","Do not waste your money on this cd. Not worth it. This is the worst album of UH from Conquest to the present day. All the songs are the same, repetitious and boring. A shame, after a interesting albumr as Raging Silence...this.I love Heep, but it's true. Different World sucks"
4,Another Great Step 2 item,"We really wanted a table in the $40 range but I pointed out to my husband that Step 2 stuff is basically undestructable and will last us for years. Extremely easy to put together. The chair seats are just a tad too high for our 17 mo. old which is to be expected as it is aged 2+. We'll keep an eye out and store them for a bit if need be. The table is the perfect height for him to stand & work with his mega blocks, eat a snack etc. This table has a large surface area compared to others. I'm thinking that my son is going to use the chairs to climb on so if this is a concern for you you might want to go with the picnic style table instead. Also the surface is fairly smooth so when drawing with crayons it doesn't make the drawing turn all funky like some rougher table surfaces do."
5,A great find,"I picked this book up by chance, and my son will not let me put in down! It is great. The illustrations are very detailed and lead to great conversations. It is almost a shame it is a ""bedtime book"" because we get so involved in talking about the story and the pictures that he doesn't really get sleepy. It is a favorite of us both. I am sure that this will be the gift we bring to every birthday party we are invited to in the future."
3,Not so bad!,"Despite what everyone else on this page has said, I think this CD player is pretty good, for what you're paying. The headphones, though flimsy, have not broken and the 40-sec ESP works GREAT. I use it in my car and even if when going around a corner the player goes sliding off the dash and onto the floor, it doesn't miss a beat. The sound is not suberb, but this is primarily because of the cheap headphones. I had some other headphones and when I use them instead, the sounds is much, much better. For $45, it's a good buy."
2,Do not BUY unless you have GREEN fetish!,"I bought this for a gift to a friend. I know what you are thinking. ""40-sec ESP, Cool Green Colors, and CHEAP! GREAT!"" NO!! NO!! NO!! You are making a mistake. Although this player do offer 40-sec ESP, you should also think about battery life. Unlike Sony's 32~64 hours/2 batt life, this drinks up batteries like gatorades. Also green color only looks good on small sized pics as on the description on web. As soon as you see it for real, you will only see a big chunk of greenish plastic. Not recommended at all. Spend $20~$40 more, and get SONY or Panasonic. You won't at least be fooled in front of other friends like me."
1,May be much cheaper locally,Those who have trouble finding butane fuel locally may want to check with Asian markets. Butane burner stoves are often used for Asian cooking in homes that have electric kitchen ranges. I just bought a 4-pack of the 8 oz. butane fuel cans for $5.49 at an Asian market -- compared to $9.30 + $6.99 shipping through Amazon.
3,trash bags,"I did not notice when ordering that these are NOT drawstring bags, which I prefer. Totally my fault, otherwise the bags are great, exactly like regular trash bags."
3,Not so essential,"I didn't think this product was anything special. Postives are that it is very light weight and only takes a little. This product might work fine for a twenty something fair skin guy, but being a dark skinned senior citizen it didn't do enough for me to shell out $46 to buy it again. For my money, Phytomer Homme Age Matrisse does a better job."
5,Great poetry,"Jim Morrison is the best poet I have ever heard. Even though his lyrics are a bit on the dark side, there is a certain beauty in them also. The music that the surviving members have added actually enhances the poetry. The two compliment each other beautifully. When Jim died, the world lost a great talent-not only a poet, but a great lyricist as well and a very talented singer."
1,Definately NOT the Doors' best work,"After learning that Jim Morrison had put out a spoken-word album with music by the Doors before his death, I decided to purchase it, solely on the fact that I enjoyed the piece entitled Ghost Song, which can be found on the Doors' greatest hits album. I had hoped that the remainder of his poetry would be of a similarly spiritual bent. Listening to this CD, however, I was VERY disappointed. Though the words to Ghost Song are included in the accompanying booklet, Ghost Song is the only bright spot on an otherwise confused and strange recording and is the only thing saving it from no stars at all. Much of the poetry included on this album could be considered (and was to me) offensive and not what I was expecting at all. Definately the worst of what the Doors have to offer."
2,Boring and somewhat silly,"Look, I myself am a Doors fan and habe been since I was 10(I'm 27 now). But instead of being a Jim Morrison worshipper, I think that really the whole band was good, which is why the songs worked. Imagine if Morrison had a Strawberry Alarm Clock backing him?How would 'The End' have sounded then?I think Jim was a great singer, able to pull off a sinatra croon or a racous blues. But his lyrics were sometimes interesting and sometimes insipid. This recording is kind of pointless, full of cocaine fueled dribble. The Doors sound okay, they must have wanted to record together again, but this recording is just ghoulish. Skip it."
3,hmmmm,"Well the book was a nice thing to add to my colection but the charcters seemed a bit off from the show, they acted more like 10 year olds than 16 or 17. They didn't know what Dr. Quest was talking about sometimes and it's something most kids would know let alone the Quest kids (who hack into goverment buildings) But once you get into the story it's pretty good, it just has a rouph start."
4,Entertaining,"Nope this isn't as good as Top Gear, but it does feature some superb cars, as well as the rubbish.FYI the cars are:Maserati QuattroporteRenault EspaceAston Martin DB9 Volante, Aston Martin V8 VantageRange Rover SportTriumph TR7Ford ScorpioPerodua KelisaBMW M5Ferrari F340, Ferrari Enzo, Ferrari 612 ScagliettiVW Golf GTICitroen 2CVChevrolet CorvetteTVR SagarisVauxhall MonaroAs some previous reviewers have already said, in places it is funny, but it lacks the spark that Clarkson has when he's working with Hammond and May. He may be the star, and the best thing about Top Gear, but he is not as good without Hammond and May.Fortunately for me I picked this up very cheap. If I'd paid the normal price for this it would only have got 3 stars from me."
5,Jeremy Clarkson reigns supreme,"I purchased this item for my husband as part of his Christmas present. We have watched it a few times. Clarkson is at his best. We absolutely love his wit. Jeremy Clarkson is unique in his presentation, we have watched him on Top Gear for years and never tire of his exploits. I recommend this DVD wholeheartedly."
4,"Top Gear, minus 2","As the title says, though Jeremy Clarkson is alone, it feels 90% like an old epiosde of Top Gear.It has all the elements of it (with the exception of Cpt. Slow & Hammond) Jeremy's usual attitude/character when talking about cars, Jeremy tearing around a closed runway track, little interesting demos and situations, and of course the stig arriving in dramatic fashion to give the cars a real workout.This is a must for any fan of Top Gear, and especially any fan in the US, since as far as I can tell, there don't seem to be many Jeremy Clarkson DVD's in region 1 format."
4,Very Good Story....Very Abrupt Ending,"I thought the book was well written, the characters were complex and personable. I don't know much about Judaism or Jewish communities but it didn't matter when reading this novel. The author provided just enough background information on the unfamiliar that I didn't feel disconnected from the story, i.e., I don't think anything went over my head. My only complaint is with the ending. The ending couldn't have been more abrupt if the author typed in ""I'm done writing. The End."" That Blair Witch ending is why I'm giving this book 4 stars instead of 5. I think that Tova Mirvis is a gifted writer and I will definitely pick up some of her other work."
3,ultra orthodox meets outside world,"The first half of the book was interesting story. It was I will call a beach read. But, the rest of the story was weak. It pretty much how as a orthodox do you fit in to the rest of the world.There were some funny parts especially when the sisters were having a chemetz fight. When Barach realized how does he study torah when he is suppose to as a orthodox jew. The father looses his job and helps( he thinks, for his son in law's business. What a disaster. The son in law, decides he would like to work as well as study. Can he find a balance. It is never answered in the conclusion of the book. I think the author was trying to deliver a message. Can you be orthodox, and live in a secular society?"
1,Be Careful!,"Be careful when considering this product by GPX! It's true it is a good looking, compact stereo and the price is affordable. However the performance leaves a lot to be desired. I ordered two as gifts for my daughters and neither of the CD players worked very well from the beginning (the machines had to be tipped at a 45 degree angle to operate the CD players.) One of them has a malfunctioning tape player, the door fell off, and after only 2 months, neither works with batteries."
1,Consider another product.,"I received this as a gift, so I'm glad I didn't have to shell for this. I am in agreement with the others who say that this product has defects. In my case, it is the radio. I listen to the radio more than I play cassettes or CDs, but it takes a ton of jiggling the settings slider before it will come on and stay on. And forget turning the radio off...then I must start the ritual again. It is very frustrating. The cassette player works well, and the cd player is adequate--not great--but adequate."
5,Looks mahvelous!,"This is the most adorable gadget. I have the GPX portable green CD player, too, and they both sound fine, but they look great! I have a lime IMac and several other lime office accessories, and this one is a nice addition to the collection. I would have paid more for it, so I think it is a good value, especially if you are interested in the design aspect."
1,"Mr. Wonderful, Just Ask Me!","Sam makes great beer and it's a good thing because he can't write: ""If an innovative idea was meant to succeed it will, and if it wasn't it won't."" Okay Sherlock Holmes, thanks for that groundbreaking insight.Keep in mind three things about this company:1. They, (Yes, a successful company is about more than one person. It's a lot of talented people and team work, but you would never know it listening to P. T. B. Sam.) Dogfish Head, got started when the microbrew craze took off.2. Beer is not rocket science - it's only four ingredients. One of which is water.3. Simple minds always confuse being unconventional with being innovative. That's just snobbishness, which is what all microbrew marketing targets.If you want to read this book, be smart and save your money for beer, get it from the library."
1,could i be wrong?,"Many of the other reviewers seem to love this book, I don't know why I feel differently. Honestly, after 100 pages I am not sure that I will continue reading. I expected more from an Author who received a college degree in English. I find the book to be humorous but terribly disorganized and repetitive. At times I wondered if I had lost my place and picked up at an earlier chapter in the book. The stories are interesting but I find them to be filled with subjective assessments of consumers. The stories would have been more convincing if some of the consumer insights had quantitative evidence that supported them. Oddly, I found similar issues in a book by the CEO of one of the ""nameless and faceless"" companies (""Grinding it out"" by Ray Kroc of McDonalds) that Sam often mentions but I found the book by the faceless organization to be much more engaging. Maybe I just am not off centered enough to appreciate this book. One of these days I will try the beer though."
2,Poorly assembled,This was a Christmas present for my 5 year old son and while he loves it he can not skate more than a foot without veering off to the right. The wheels were put on crooked. I think this is a great product but the assembly line needs to be reviewed and improved.
4,Interesting take on a peer,The novel is about a Robin Hood-like thief who meets a young lady of the upper ton. The lady is seeking to stay unmarried until at least her 21st birthday so she can inherit an estate and practice social reform. The tension and chemistry between the two characters is great! They are both likeable and believable. There are several twists in turns that keep the book interesting.
5,l hated the stepmother...i really did,"I thought this was a sweet book, I really thought it would be cheesy and to a degree it was.I loved the heroine and her need to manage everyone and everything. It was refreshing to read something different, she wasnt simpering and well a good word would be full of honor. The heroine did her best to do what was best for everyone and that included herself...again refreshing.I loved the hero also, although he was a bit slow on the uptake. His original thoughts of her were hilarious.Overall the story moved along quickly and sometimes too fast to be believable but I loved it nonetheless"
4,Nothing is as fun as a Deere.,"Great toy, bought for my niece and she loved it. The belt loops don't seem too well suited to the individual tools, and overall is a bit large, but great toy none the less. The hat was a big hit!"
2,Liar's Moon,"I'm an extra in the movie! I had to have it! You can see me at the carnival. I am strolling in the background right around kissing booth scene! I made 65 bucks for working 2 nights, all night! I still have the original cash!"
3,Science Friction,"Cathy Cobb has obviously made a choice. Physical chemistry and chemists are percieved by most people as being dull and mostly boring, Cathy Cobb has appointed herself to vivify not only the subject matter, but to create a lively account that would be entertaining to the advanced highschool student. She has embellished and rationalized the lives and times of many of the great figures while assuming an almost flippant familiarity with the subject matter and her subjects. Some of her explanations of complex issues border on brilliance while others are much less well founded. There are in addition, errors of both substance and proof reading that speak for a casual attitude toward the reader. Many people in chemistry will welcome her lively imagination and attempts to make some chemists more human. On the other hand this is not a history, but rather a fanciful essay by someone with a sense of humor."
3,Did the writers watch wrestling?,I was looking to buy this book last night at the mall. I browsed through a few pages only to find wrong answers for questions. What's the point of making a trivia book if your answers aren't even correct? Go ahead take a look under No Way Out for trivia. It asks what the February pay per view for the WWE is and sure enough the answer is Backlash! Now any legit wrestling fan knows the annual February PPV is No Way Out! Secondly under the same category it asks who was the Champion at the first No Way Out? Now any wrestling fan again would know that the answer is Shawn Michaels heading into the biggest main event in the history of Wrestlemania at the time. However the book says Steve Austin! Do what you will with this. I would not waste my money on buying this book. The only purpose it will serve is to confuse all wrestling fans. Beware!
2,ok if you dont mind someone talking while you relax,"This tape is ok if you dont mind someone talking while you try and relax. Its not for me persay, but some people may like the self hypnosis kinda relaxation technique."
2,Charging Cord Did Not Fit,"The cord clearly states is for PSP. It will charge but it does not fit. You have to gently place the PSP down to keep the cord in slot just right. Luckily I found my original charger that fits snugly into the charging hole. It was cheap, and it does work....I just don't think that the product description is entirely correct."
5,Works!,"Received a PSP1000 as a gift (more like a random, ""Here you can have this""), but that is all I got. There was no cord, so I looked up a few on here. A lot of the reviews said to go with namebrand because it's more reliable, it fits properly, etc. So, I did.I've only had this for a couple weeks, but everything is as it should be and I really do not regret paying the extra $10 for this one (namebrand things that are specifically made for an item brings a sort of comfort to me). This is also the only one I could see it listing that is is compatable with psp 1000 2000 and 3000.The cord (2 connected) is quite long, more than 6 feet long (*Ah, it says it's about 10ft: each cord being 1.5m or 5ft).It does come with a 1-year limited warranty also."
5,good for price,the price you pay for this compared to another charger it is well worth it even though all the reviews are all bad or mostly all bad it works fine
2,Picture just aint right,Ok. I did my homework; read the reviews; read the specifications; and looking at the the picture for this item you would think that it includes the bottom shelf. My order did not come with this. Very disappointing.
5,Avril Still Rocks,"This CD Single shows us the still-rocking Avril, just because the song could sound a little bit pop does not mean that, 'cause here you can see the happy Avril, she did what she wanted to, I like this song and the CD because shows me a real Avril, another face of her.Go on Avril!!!"
4,this is awesome!,"You get NBA ballers(...) and midway treasures(...) for the price of just NBA ballaz. You save 20 bucks on two awesome video games. You cant tell me you dont like the ol' school games that started it all, or that you dont like blingin' while you're ballin'. so make the right decision and go out and buy this awesome package for yourself or for a gift or even a friend.happy gamin'"
1,Fine if you only want it for the short-term,"Another online store had this clearanced for $9.99, so I bought it to play tapes at night for my infant. The bonus was that my 3-year-old discovered he loved singing along with the microphone (during the day, of course)! I thought it was handy that there was a separate volume control for the mic. Unfortunately, less than a year after purchasing this player, the ""play"" button on the top-loading cassette broke unexpectedly when I pushed it ... I guess it's not made to be pushed once a night. The concept on this is great, but the quality was not up to most electronics companies' standards."
5,SAVE MONEY For a Brand New Copy,"This book is available, brand new, from Seed Savers Exchange, www.seedsavers.org, for $16.95. I am looking at the current, paper catalog and was astounded to see the prices being asked on Amazon. Tsk."
1,What about Meat? This book is good for vegetarians.,"This book is excellent but has one major flaw. It does not even mention meat! The title should seriously be changed to ""Keeping Fruits and Vegetables Fresh"" or ""Keeping Plant Foods Fresh"" It is certainly a great resource on that subject and I reccomend it to anyone for that purpose but the use of the all encompassing word ""food"" in the title suggests more. I was mislead by the title and must give it a low rating just to alert people to this fact so others don't make the same mistake as I purchased it with an interest in preserving wild game and was utterly dissapointed when I opened it's pages."
4,Everyday conversations between God and a young teenager,"Keeping it real: a young teen talks with GodLeslie, at 13 enters junior high (some will know this as middle school) with all the ""hang ups"" that hit kids this age. Leslie hates to be short, attends a church group, and wonders about everything in her life- her size, her looks, boys, wearing braces, parents and teachers, and her relationship to God. She keeps a journal of thoughts. Instead of writing ""Dear Diary', she writes ""Dear God"". Basically she is sorting out the process of becoming an adult. By the end of the school year, she is adapting a positive attitude, understanding that parents are people with their own strengths and weaknesses, and delving into her relationship with God. In a way, this book reminds me of a favorite television program. ""Joan of Arcadia"" was a program about a teenager who talks to God to obtain an understanding about life. Unfortunately, it has gone off the air. Fortunately, this book remains available."
5,A Teen's Faith and Life Journey,"Told through the eyes of thirteen year old Leslie, this book addresses topics of importance to a teenager's faith and life journey. Leslie's letters to God provide a means of finding answers to many of her questions as she struggles with a variety of challenges. Instead of an adult giving Leslie answers, Leslie arrives at her own answers that teens and parents reading this book will appreciate. ""Keepin"" It Real"" is a delightful, encouraging and comforting read for teens and their parents."
5,Monte Walsh,"Great Movie, great price, great time on arrivel, will buy again from great vendor.Thank-you very much.JM"
5,Not Compatible with 64 bit Windows 7,"I was eager to purchase this game, but took the precaution of checking with the Microsoft Windows 7 Compatibility Center and discovered that none of these games will work with 64 bit Windows 7 (though they are compatible with 32 bit Windows 7).Naturally, I'm running the 64 bit version so I'm out of luck, but glad I checked first!"
4,Some useful info and an easy read,"A sense of humor and sarcasm guaranteed to make you cringe, a very limited set of cases (mainly IT), examples and industry references and too many mentions of Bill Gates are the bad points of this book, but all in all I found it useful. A sort of business and entrepreneurship for dummies guide. Highly recommended starting point for those want to become business people but know that their knowledge of business basics is lacking. Perhaps not so useful for people not in this position. Sections on compounding and cashflow stick as two of the more useful."
1,Never order thru Audible.com,"Never order thru Audible.comTook me three times to try and purchase an A&E; Haunted History Audiobook to listen to my trip to Gettysburg.

5,Love them!,"I love these boots, my dog wears them inside so she won't lick her paws. They are very handy and work well, stay easily. Make sure you don't put them on too tight."
4,Historical Account of Air Warfare,"John Buckley's Air Power In The Age Of Total War, determines that aeronautical technology is what allows for a climax in `total war'. The author describes total war as the expansion of battlefield strategy onto the urban sectors of enemy territory. Total war has two primary effects. Bringing air war tactics to the home front creates both physical and psychological disruption to the enemy's war efforts. Though some of the material can be dry at times, it is necessary information to include in supporting the book's thesis and providing the historical evolution of `strategic' air warfare. As well, targeting industrialization destroys the enemy's war economy by severing military life lines. Throughout his work, Buckley maintains a focus on a clear thesis. Furthermore, he summarizes his argument through the use of an effective title."
5,Shows the Length the DDR Went to Control its Own People,"Jack Koehler, as a correspondent living in East Germany, is able to give an unbiased view of the way the Stasi operated during the Cold War. Koehler reveals the methods of the Stasi with unpartial candor. The Stasi were one of the most feared and most formidable security agencies in the world and Koehler's book not only details their work, but gives insider's accounts of what life in a DDR under Stasi rule was like."
3,"Its good, but...","This book is good but I felt like the author tried too hard to make Anne Boleyn look like a saint, that she was a Protestant martyr. While she wasn't a She-devil, she certainly wasn't an angel. I didn't find too many errors in the book, but I felt as though some of her justifications for certain things are a bit weak. Its an easy read though, the writing isn't too scholarly. Reading about the life of Anne Boleyn is always fascinating no matter what.If you are someone who enjoys reading about Anne Boleyn or anything about the Tudors, like I do go ahead and read it. If you are looking for something more acurate, read Eric Ives biography about Anne."
1,Terrible,"As a Tudorphile, I looked forward to reading this book. It's terrible. Don't waste your time."
1,What a pile of junk!,"Talk about missing the entire ballpark. Weston (the author) says he wrote a book about finding a wife in Russia that doesn't have the american women downfalls (all the downfalls he complains about are the same downfalls he exibits throughout the entire book). He tells the story of an entire four year relationship that went bad entirely form his point of view and him being the victom in the story. If you want a story about a backstabing shallow man this is the book to read. If you want information about finding a Russian wife I pray that no one else use these methods. I am trying not to say anything spitful about this book but it is very hard. The people I hope read this book is Russian women, so they can be aware of people like Weston, even though it is to late for the people he effected."
3,A cheap Sci-Fi movie that is enjoyable.,"'Andriod' is a fantastic example of how an enjoyable Sci-Fi film can be made without eye-popping special effects, monster aliens, and a gigantic budget. The strange thing about this movie is that there is a megasuperstar, Klaus Kinski, at the center of it all. It is odd to see such a talented and supreme actor alonside with people who probably have vanished by now. I like the twist at the end of this movie. I did not see it coming."
4,"What Loux does, he does well","""Metaphysics"" has meant many things to many different people. Loux helpfully distinguishes in the introduction between general and special metaphysics. The former concerns being qua being, and the latter concerns disparate topics such as free will, cosmology, and God. Loux said he would only concern himself with general metaphysics. Specifically, he concerns himself with Anglophone general metaphysics from 1950 to 1990. Thus, the subtitle, ""A Contemporary Introduction.""Loux treats universals (realism vs. nominalism), concrete particulars (substrata vs. bundles, persistence through time), propositions, and modality (necessity and possibility). He handles matters will a degree of explicitness, thoroughness, and evenhandedness. The text is challenging at points--I attribute this to the fact that metaphysics cannot be dumbed down.All in all, quite thorough and an excellent introduction to contemporary general metaphysics."
4,Well written and lucid,"This is an excellent introduction to contemporary metaphysics. You cannot put this book down without clearly understanding the many shades of Realism and Nominalism. The chapters on necessity and possibility were excellent.For me, at least, there is the glaring omission of any sort of contribution that A. Whitehead (the 20th century's pre-eminent metaphysician)made to the field, but that's understandable in an introductory text.This is philosophy. Go for it."
3,Kindle Edition is FIRST EDITION not the THIRD,"PLEASE NOTE!At the time of this writing, the Amazon Kindle store displays the *third* edition cover of this text, and when purchased it is the *third* edition cover that appears in the kindle library... HOWEVER the actual text is the FIRST edition. Caveat Emptor. I've notified Amazon of this (and received a reply) but until they change the cover image, just be sure you realize what you're purchasing."
3,Good Scrubber,"Good power, good torque. Cleanser comes out of that white nub you see at the front of the handle... between the handle and the cleanser reservoir, with a spray like on an iron. I would rather have it come from somewhere within the brush head, so that gravity would let you use a higher viscosity cleaning product, like a pine sol. Also, the little vinyl (?) cap covering the recharge connection won't stay closed."
1,Poorly designed,"Battery drains quickly. The spinning head stops if you apply even a modest amount of downward pressure when trying to clean a surface. The balance of the device in your hand is awful, it is as bad an ergonomic design / layout for a tool that I have ever used. I do not understand what all these attachments are for, why are they all in there ? I used to have the older model of this which had a higher torque motor, did not have that ridiculous fluid reservoir and last-but-not-least Black and Decker shrunk the diameter of the yellow bristle brush so it does not clean as wide a surface as the older model. I'm guessing this design was done by people in some far away place who have no clue on functionality and ergonomics. Plus, the bean counters figured they could save a dime $0.10 a unit by shrinking the bristle brush head diameter. Overall, a piece of junk. If Amazon would have a lower rating than 1-star I'd give it that but, unfortunately, that option is not available."
5,Amen!!!!!,"It has lived here two days now, and will never leave! Does all as promised and has joined my Black & Decker coffee pot, GrassHog and Cordless Broom as permanent residents. I have never had a problem with Black & Decker products."
4,Great Product,Sure makes cleaning the tub area easier and saves time. Does not harm the surface and keeps the tub very clean.
2,Greatly Disappointed,"I was very excited to get this item, only to be let down. After the lengthy time to let the battery charge, it didn't even last long enough to clean the shower. Even ignoriging the fact that the charge doesn't hold long, I can still clean things quicker with just a little elbow grease and a scrub brush. The case to store it in is the cheap plastice case it came in that won't stay closed. The reservoir for the cleaning solution leaks and replacement scrubbing pads are sometimes hard to find."
1,Not good,Do not buy it. It does not clean anything at all. I am better off cleaning with my own hands than depend and waste time using this.
4,A great introduction to Eastern Philosophy,"This book was not my first introduction to Indian philosophy, though it was my first to Chinese and Japanese philosophy, and I found the information to be well-presented and (at least in the case of Indian philosophy) accurate to the best of my knowledge.One of the previous reviewers of this book has indicated it to be obscuring, but with all the name-dropping of important ideas and thinkers Brannigan does, I can hardly see how he obscures anything. Certainly, this book could be better referenced, but it is only an introductory text, and many of the primary sources used are contained in the text itself.All in all, it's a great introduction to Asian philosophy, especially for those who have a fair amount of Western philosophy under their belt."
1,The Stripping of the Altars 2nd edition,"David Huntley, TorontoInstead of commenting on Professor Duffy's faulty question-begging logic, I will refer to a closely-related topic lying outside of the period dealt with in the book. While both Protestant and Catholic countries perpetrated various kinds of imperialistic atrocities, domestic democratic politics developed earlier in Protestant countries than in Catholic countries. This may be connected with the latitudinarianism of most Protestant denominations in contrast with the ongoing authoritarianism of Catholicism. If this is so, then as a non-believer I feel citizens of democratic countries should thank God for the reformation, and that He will graciously grant Professor Duffy absolution."
2,a PIECE OF CRAP,"This radio was ok at first but after I used it for a week, and I don't mean rough use, just regular in the house never moves kind of use the cd player crapped out on me. I was so mad. I paid much, much too much for this and I don't advise that you waste your money."
3,"The game is awesome, but I did t get it I got a credit refund so I am a little disappointed it didn't come, but I got MLB 2k11.","MLB 2k11 is awesome, because it is not to hard compared to the show my player is about the only mode I play besides franchise, but MLB 07 the show is still great if I actually got the game I would give it four stars."
4,Great Book,This book was really great. It really shows that you even though smeone died you have to let it go. I just had a recent death in my family and this book helped me let go of it.
5,Exactly what I was looking for,This playseat is exactely what I was looking for! Makes video gaming much more fun and realistic than just the regular PS3 control.I recomend.
2,Beware No Customer Service After Sale,Mine was damaged in shipment. Contacted UPS and they inspected package promptly and said they would arrange with playseat.com for the items return. I was instructed by UPS I would need to contact playseat.com for the return arrangements since I had paid them. Used every contact email listed on there web site. Never got a single response from them. They were very prompt answering my emails prior to the sale. After the sale they disappear. Just be warned.
3,Not Happy,"I received the seat shipped via ground when I paid for 2 day shipping. Long story but Amazon did not help me out in this matter. When I received the product, many of the pieces where scratch badly. Also Screws did not fit like they where suppose to in the support brackets. I have the xbox 360 wheel which by the way does not fit on the post at all. For the amount of money I spent on this seat, it would have been better well spent on something else."
1,Apex makes junk,"Apex Digital products often fail within the first year. They have horrible customer service, false advertising, and fail to honor their warranties. Please check www.labbb.gov (Better Business Bureau) and search for Apex Digital to see the F rating the better business bureau has given them. Saving 10-15 dollars is not worth the hassle they cause."
3,Not bad for the money,This is not a bad player for the money. It only plays 10 hours of mp3's while others play as much as is on the CD. If you want something with a bit better picture and sound spend a few extra bucks and get a GPX-DV2000 or something. I would recommend another.
3,mmm,"Okay.. for those of you who are expecting to add this card set to your postcard collection... like I was until I opened this box... they are just normal flash cards. They are not postcards. If you are a postcrosser like me, you dont want to get these cards."
4,Mmm Mmm Good,"My wife and I both love this Dill seasoning. It's great on anything that you wish to add just a little something extra. I put it on potato salad, chicken salad, & sandwiches."
3,Not for Lovecraft purists,"This is not a bad book, but it's not good Lovecraft. Yog-Sothoth has now become an ""extension"" of Cthulhu(?), and this whole story is definitely not in any Lovecraft, or Derleth, or any follower of Lovecraft, mold. With that out of the way, it's not a bad story. A little too much emphasis on sex, but that's not unusual for today's writers. The characters are a little two dimensional and just slightly too ""heroic"" for their own good. If you love Lovecraft, don't even think of reading or buying this book."
4,Lovin' Life,"Although some parts of this book were wordy, overall I thoroughly enjoyed it. The book enabled me to see more in to the life of Jackson Browne, and to understand more of what he is about. I know it was not an approved biography. After reading it I'm not sure why he disapproved as I did not find it derogatory in any way! Interesting and a good read overall."
4,Good history lesson,"This book was very interesting, but parts of it read like an encyclopedia. There are a lot of names given in the book, some recognizable and some not. Good read, but parts aremaybe a little too in depth."
5,The mind and heart opener,"Like the title above states this is my opinion of all of Gloria Benish's books. All chapters are introduced in a very warm, friendly and welcoming way. After reading all her books, some things may appear repetitious. I just look at them as quick reminders. Sometime this is necessary. Just have the patience to absorb all info. This is what's completely different about this 3rd book: it challenges the mind a bit through the sections at the end of each chapter and the new info off course. Anyways, in my heart her book gets more than 5 stars."
4,Lies Flat on My Desk,"It's small enough to toss into a briefcase or purse. It lies flat on my desk, making it easier to use. Has all the diagnostic criteria, and the basics of a five axis diagnosis. Includes basic GAF info. Index. All I ever need to know from the DSM I find in here.Unless you have a good reason (you're enrolled in a psychopathology class) to use the full-up DSM-IV, do yourself and your muscles a favor and get this one.(If you'd like to comment on this review, click on the ""about me"" link above & drop me an email. Thanks!)"
3,Too small for fireplace grates,I didn't realize how small these were when I ordered them. They either have to be placed on the fireplace floor or on top of a piece of wood on the grate. Several are needed to get a fire started. I won't be buying these again.
4,I cant wait to try these,These were a gift to my husband who loves making fires outside in the fire pit. I am hoping these will make it easier for him to start his fires.
2,moving on,"did not meet our needs at all. hoped to replace using duralogs with these nuggets and wood. oh well, back to duralogs. still searching for a great, easy and reliable starter. open to ideas!"
2,About what I expected,"The Acting was of porn quality. The film was more like a home movie. I have to hand it to the producers they did tread in taboo waters but chicken out at the last minute.The first story was the best. The story was arousing, actoress were beautiful and some lines were titlateing. Unfornately they skipped from the introduction to the ending. I would of like to seen more of a detailed story.The second story followed thourgh with the concept a little more. If you gothic girls this one is for you. At least this one gave more details.The third story was little more than a snuff. It had several actors some the of female were very attractive. Basically they introduce some and killed them in about 3 seconds..."
3,Good unit but.....,"Good GPS unit but..... I move it between my boats and truck. I have the XM Ant with Weather option. Big aid in avoiding Gulf thunderstorms. Power plug difficult to insert and remove. Plug broke after 3-4 times. Garmin customer service very difficult to work with, after several phone calls, emails, they finally sent me the wrong cord as a replacement. Battery failed after 11 months....forget trying to get Garmin to replace that."
2,"Okay unit, but a few problems after using","I've owned the Garmin 478 for a couple of years and while I've generally found it to be a good unit, there are a couple of problems I've encountered. First, the power/recharge plug is very poorly designed (as others here have noted) and isn't sealed against the elements if you use this on an open boat. Second, and more problematic, is that the unit is held together with small steel screws that have begun to corrode and will over time expand and cause the plastic case to crack. These should clearly have been made of stainless steel. After trying unsuccessfully to get someone from Garmin tech support on the phone, they emailed me to say there was nothing they could do about the corrosion..."
3,Family Wicca,"I know this book gets great reviews, but it didn't gain my interest. In working with my granddaughter, I find I never take it off the shelf. . . ."
2,Halper's collection,"The pictures are indeed magnificent, however, I must demur about the accompanying text which does not provide appropriate, tightly written or in some instances, historically accurate information."
5,Best raft EVER!!,"I have been rafting for about 10 years now. Most of the rivers that we hit range from class 2 to class 3 and maybe a couple of spots with class 4 rapids. Needless to say, Fishhunter made it through with no problems. And just last weekend we have taken 2 of our Fishhunters on to White Salmon River (class 4) and it was fine, just a few scratches."
5,Great Fishing Boat!!!!,"For the price, you will not beat it. I own this model and the HF-360. If your going to take 2 people, then by all means, get the 360 (12ft).2 adults in the 280 does not work with your gear. I take the HF-280 to the lake and fish every week and it has NEVER let me down. I use the floorboard..... along with the motor mount, 34lb thrust trolling motor, and a swivel seat. Ive had the 280 for 9 years!!! Ive patched it 3 times...still going!"
5,What Is Tere to Say,"I first read this book in 1981 when I joined the corps. I have been out for 13 years and am reinlisting in the Marine Corps Reserves. I purschased this book from the MCA as a refresher since my original copy was lost in a fire. The information is as outstanding as I remember. Not only a book of information, but a sacred text. Semper Fi"
4,Easy to install!,"Besides working just great, this was easy to install. I know little about hardware and I was nervous opening the tower but I did it and had no problems."
1,Plant loss,I have purchased 3 of these units for multiple properties and two of the three have failed multiple times. The manufacturer had to replace parts again and again. No explanation but they failed in the worst way- THE WATER DID NOT TURN OFF!!! Hours and hours of water were wasted again and again and again and again. I would NEVER recommend this unit and have I REPLACED ALL OF THEM.
1,lasted 2 weeks!,"This is not a reliable product!! My wife said that the timer had stopped working and needed new batteries, I thought - wow this thing will get through batteries quick. Changed the batteries and the display is dead."
1,Total failure after just 1 year,"Very disappointing. This timer did not even last one year. It now turns on and off randomly. After I first noticed the malfunction, I checked the batteries with a multimeter and found them to be weak. I replaced them (2 9 volt) and reprogrammed the unit. It still has a mind of it's own. Into the trash it goes.It was not cheap to buy and seemed like a quality unit when I received it, but it has turned out to be a piece of junk. I wish I could find a watering timer that works over time. I had a gilmour that lasted a year and a half. The best results I've had were from a melnor brand I got from Home Depot, but that only lasted 3 years. A landscaping guy that lives up the street told me that you need to spend $100 to get a good one. I'm still trying to swallow that price and may just have to put that bit of watering back in the chore schedule. Stay away from this one!!"
2,"Timer is great, but not very well made","I just finished disconnecting this timer, and tomorrow I will return it to the hardware store where I bought it. I have had it for about two weeks. The timer mechanism works just fine, but apparently the valve doesn't: I have a continual leakage when the water is supposed to be off. I just placed an order on Amazon for two more Gilmour timers to add to the ones I already have--they are the only timers I have used that have always been reliable."
5,Love the removeable timer unit.,"We're taking a week-long trip soon, and I'm murder on plants as it is. I just planted two roses, and feel they need some water every day. I ordered this timer for that purpose. I love the part where you can slide the electronic unit off, and program it in your living room if you wish. It works like a charm.I'd recommend this unit for anyone who forgets to water their outdoor plants."
5,An excellent product!,"I have used this timer for many years! they last, they work well and they don't eat batteries like I have been told other brands and stiles do!"
5,Very Nice Piece of Equipment,"This timer looks good and works well. It is easy to program or to change functions such as days to water, watering time, etc. The ability to remove the control section from the valve is a real plus, I set it up in the cool of my house instead of our 100F+ Texas heat. Reliability remains a question. We have only had it about a month, but so far it works well. It feeds a 12 psi pressure regulator and 150 ft of soaker hose, a very nice setup!Update 10/2010. We are approaching the end of the second full season of use with this water timer. It has worked flawlessly. For reliable operation, depending on use, you have to be prepared to replace a battery at least once per season."
1,Works for maybe 2-3 weeks!,Easy to program. Looks like good quality but timer is all screwed up. You can manually make it open and close so batteries are good and also keeps correct time. It will come on and stay on forever. Set for 1 hour at 5:30am and 1 hour at 6:30pm. It was still running at noon time today. Definitely keep an eye on this thing after 1 month.
3,Disappointed--BROKE 3rd WEEK....$$$ water bill:(,"Probably a great product... Well-reviewed by others.... I likely just got a ""lemon"".... Only writing this review for 2 reasons (LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES / oversights):1) if you buy one, try it right away [I let mine sit unopened in garage for few weeks..... now, too late to return].2) use it for awhile before you entrust it with watering while your out of town..... (just came home to flooded landscaped areas..... Not sure how many days it's been running 24/7.... Did some reprogramming, trouble-shooting and ""DIY-diagnostics:)"" and seems like the shut-off valve malfunctioned.... There is an audible ""click"" suggesting the digital program is communicating to the valve, but no functional response).I may actually buy another one, cuz if it works, it's a nifty little gadget"
2,Used it for one year. Stored over the winter and it doesn't work anymore.,Seemed like a decent timer and it worked good the first season I used it.. Kept it in storage over the winter and just got it out and it doesn't work.. even when the display says OFF it still lets water through.
2,Can't hold up to Florida,"This is the second Orbit product I am reviewing, and while it lasted longer than the first one, neither of the two could handle the downpours of Florida. I actually had to take this one apart and use a hot air blower to get the water out of the supposedly waterproof timer device. I will never purchase another Orbit garden timer for as long as I live in Florida."
2,DO NOT BUY!,"THIS IS A PIECE OF JUNK. SOUND QUALITY IS MEDIOCRE AND NOT AS GOOD AS THE 18 YEAR OLD PHILLIPS SINGLE PLAY IT REPLACED. THE REAL PROBLEM IS PROGRAMMING IT - IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. YOU CAN PUSH THE ""SELECT DISC"" BUTTON A HUNDRED TIMES WITHOUT SUCCESS AND SELECTING A TRACK IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE - YOU HAVE ABOUT 3 SECONDS TO IMPUT NUMBER BEFORE PLAY STARTS. THAT'S OFFSET BY THE WAIT BETWEEN DISC SHUFFLING. LOOK AT SOMETHING ELSE."
5,Denon MP3/CD player,Outstanding product!! Well made and performace is as it should be for Denon. I buy Denon because I want a quality product that will last. They do cost more but the reason why is quality and performance. You want Sony then buy Sony. Denon is up there top of line products. All I have is Denon in my sound system now. I'll buy Denon again if this ever goes bad.Michael
5,Impossible to put down...I read it in one sitting,"Stadler's book is a remarkable novel. His prose, of course, is incandescent and his sense of place as good as anyone writing today. The novel goes back and forth between the Steins' Paris at the turn of the century and late twentieth-century Paris. The novel--a story of obssession and erotic turmoil--begins and ends as a haunting testament to unfulfilled desire. My University class on gblt fiction read the book and found it funny, disturbing, terribly sad at times, and, as one student said, ""Impossible to put down...I read it in one sitting."" With each novel, Stadler's writing becomes more complex, elegant, and surprising. Allan Stein is his best book yet."
3,Unbeknownst To All,"I am tempestously overcome by the transcendant verse that became this novel. The personification of all that is deemed proud,our protagonist, has the ability; in a surreptitiously transparent mode, to enlighten all with his delicious considerations on all topics, each developing into microcosms of our true selves. With verve and the utmost in careful pluck, I pushed over the last page, mentally aroused to the height of mirth, with only thoughts of terrible personification of prose."
5,It works,Its a simple case to carry your psp in and the strap is handy too. Matches my white psp slim!!!
1,Don't get,"i wanted a holder for my psp so i got this one. first it took about a month to ship which was sad:( but when i opened it up i found out that it was just plane STUPID. i wish i did not get it. worst case ever. and the strap is itchy and ugly.also the case started ripping after a week. pleas, pleas, pleas don't get this item. i would Recommend to my worst enemy:)"
3,"Good for what it is, but overpriced","It's basically just a sleeve - no place for holding UMDs. For this price, I expected a LOT more."
3,Don't start with this CD.,"I was very excited to see a new studio album by Kim, and I had high hopes that this one would be as strong as his others.Sadly, I am a bit uninspired by this new set. The songs don't seem to be as strong as the ones off of ""Tigerman"" and ""My Life"". His new guitar player is OK, but he can't play swing or jump blues like Jr. Watson, Duke Robilard or Rusty Zinn (all players on Kim's previous albums). The sound quality of the disc seems a bit inferior when placed alongside ""My Life"" (there were moments on that disc where Kims voice sounded better than any blues singer has in 40 years.)The disc is good, I would buy it again if I lost it, but if you are new to Kim Wilson's solo stuff, don't start here."
2,Book is MUCH better - the movie has much to be desired,"""Coming Out of the Ice"" by Victor Herman is one of the greatest books of all time - if you haven't read it yet, go find a used copy ASAP. It will bless your life, your perspectives will change, and you will be less likely to take anything for granted again.Unfortunately, the movie adaption of this book was a disappointment. Ninety minutes and a shoestring budget cannot come near to adequately filming this amazing story.This movie needs to be remade into a 3+ hour blockbuster, with an ample budget, and someone of Spielberg's caliber in the director's chair.Truly a great story of a man who survived unimaginable odds, refused to be defeated, and ultimately triumphed over all his foes."
1,satire done badly,"This starts off wonderfully. If he'd just stopped after the skating, which would have made a great short story, it would have been vintage Cheever. Instead he went downhill all the way with a witless turn toward too broad satire. What a disappointment."
4,Needs a level shelf,"The series is great! I only wish the Anime came even close to the extent of the Manga. But that is normal.This collectors set comes in a metal ball that has a flat bottom so it will sit on the shelf. However, the flat part is not very big so a gentle bump can send your DVDs rolling."
4,quick and quiet,"I got this printer as part of an hp package, and must admit that I had my doubts about it's performance. I am pleased to report that it has proved me wrong, and hasn't failed me yet. It's remarkably quiet, and plenty fast enough for my needs. Black and color text are both crisp, and images are clear."
2,Mine had a problem,"I just thought I'd give my review of my experience with the 648c. The B&W prints are pretty decent but the color prints could use some work. I also experienced a problem with mine. The prints were angled and I was unable to fix it. Luckily, I took it back to OfficeMax and they gave me the refund which I used to buy a new 842c which I like much more. I just suggest you spend the extra bucks to buy the 842c."
2,Weekend Handyman and Scubaman,"After flipping through all the tile books at the big bookstores and the big home improvement stores, I chose this one and was certainly not disappointed. More detailed and covers a wider range of issues than any other tile book, including the Bridge book, which I bought as well. I figured if I'm spending [a small fortune]on a tile job, what's another [few dollars] to get a few more ideas.I especially liked the chapter where he takes you through a real job, with many of the real world problems one may encounter."
4,Captures Essence of DanceSport Nicely!,"As a competition dancer, I enjoyed this book thouroughly. The text is rich, and captures the essence of the Ballroom Dance very well. Accurate in content, this book describes aspects of DanceSport in a way that is satisfying to dancers, and yet would be very enjoyable and informative to non-dancers. Covering everything from the evolution of social dances to the rigors of Blackpool competition, and from what to look for in respectable dance studio to the disussion of DanceSport as an Olympic event, the book is very complete. It is a must have for DanceSport enthusiasts. The photos are vivid, though I'd have liked some detail in the captions. If you don't dance now, you'll want to give it a try by the time you reach the back cover. Nicely done Mr. Reynolds."
1,Not at all what expected,"This book was ok.....disappointing. I expected this book to be about science or at least reasonable logic. This book is just a bunch of philosophy and opinions about the authors reasons for his disbeief in god. I someone agree with a few of his points, BUT.... ALOT of his reasons for disbelief have already been answered in books published before him so i assume that he is not aware of them. This could've been a good book but honestly i had read a rebuttal to most of his objections so i guess you'd have to be unfamiliar with up to date science in order or unfamiliar to answers to his questions in order to even be impressed with this book at all. And to anyone reading this i'm not a really a bible creationist person(in case you're thing this)...just a person who's interested in the truth and this book is really misleading.I expect better from a book quoted the view of ""god in the age of science""...."
3,Disappointing,"The book consists of a long introduction written by Inger Brodey, discussing Soseki's works and life, and devoting some attention to the work translated in the body of the book: Soseki's ""Travels in Manchuria and Korea"". This book has never before been translated into English, unfortunately for good reason. Brodey mentions in the introduction that Japanese critics have generally not been very friendly to the work, deriding it as being a work mainly about Soseki's daily petty concerns and personal health as he travels through Manchuria. (The narration ends before Soseki reached Korea. No-one would be surprised, I think, if Soseki had been disappointed with his own work and decided to end it early since it was achieving nothing of real value.) These were my sentiments exactly; its narrative is tedious and lacking in any development.I myself am a great admirer of Soseki's works and literary achievements, but this book will add nothing to his reputation and will be ignored."
1,voice recorder - bad,"The second time we used this recorder it did not work, we lost a doctor's dictation for 1/2 of the people he dictated on. It's worthless and I would not recommend it ever!"
4,Increase your poker skills-- and your bankroll!,"Andy Nelson's advanced poker book is a bargain at twice the price. Folksy and informative, it clearly explains advanced hold'em strategies that I used to be unaware of. Even more helpful when taken in conjunction with a few of his other titles, which I have also read. I've probably saved more than the books cost, in a just a session or two of live play. I like to play poker, and I like Nelson's books!"
1,biased view of American History is a NO NO,Save the biased view of American History. I wanted an unbiased view of American History .....FACTS and FACTS. Don't teach lies to children or your biased view........just facts is needed.
1,Don't buy this book. Stop! I mean it!,"I bought the book because of this statement in the review: ""A strong chapter here shows how to build an ActiveX component in Java."" The chapter they refer to is 17 pages. 6 of those pages actually show how to convert a java applet to a COM component. About half of that is screen shots. That leaves 3 pages of text on how to build a COM object in Java. Wow, was I disappointed! Noone would consider that a strong chapter. Nothing about creating property pages, firing events, handling various data types. I completely wasted the money I spent for this book. Plus, it's dated, since it refers to J++ 1.1. Rats."
1,Was this made by Kinkos?,"I just recieved this book today, I was unaware of the that the entire book is just scanned copies of the original book. If I knew you could make money doing this crap I would have been doing it for years. This book is not worth 30 dollars, the pictures are dark the text is blurry, I am very dissatisfied with my purchase. I would not recommend this purchase to anyone!"
3,So-So,"Better Home and Gardens knows how to produce a high quality book. The binding is nice, the presentation clear, and the photos are pretty. So why am I rating this book 3 stars?Nothing in this book really grabbed me and made me feel that I really wanted to attempt to recreate it. I mean, look at the cover. Someone clearly went through a lot of trouble to make that avocado-colored T-Square quilt. And frankly I think it would look pretty bad on a bed. It looks nice in the photo, because you can't see most of it. Which brings me down to my second beef with this book- how the quilts are photographed. If a quilt is intended for a bed, why does the photographer crumple it and drape it over a chair? How can I tell what it looks like when its hidden? And its not just one quilt, but most of the photos are like that. Irrititating. Also, not a big fan of appliqué....So, as a book with nice photos of plain-looking quilts this book is fine. But as a book of future projects I found it to unhelpful. 3 stars."
4,Homer = Adorable,"This book is fun, entertaining, and very colorful. I'd recommend it to anyone- those with a passing interest, to die-hard fans like myself. Very informative, but most of all it's funny."
4,A treasure for a true fan!,"I recieved Tiny's CD yesterday and though I've only listened to half of it,I really love it! I had the great pleasure of seeing Tiny Tim in concert in 96, in Branson,Mo. and this CD could have been recorded on that night. Tiny was not just a novelty act, he was the consumate performer, with a vast knowledge of music history. This ""Live in London"" concert CD is Tiny at his best! I would recommend this one to fans and non-fans alike"
1,Oh Please!,I can't believe the glowing reviews here. I've been a Tiny Tim fan since the first time I saw him on 'Laugh-In' with his brown paper bag and Uke. This sound was recorded by an old magnetic tape from somewhere in the back of the room at a live recital. The lyrics are fun but the quality is beyond dreadful and at this import price...don't.
2,Bad,I don't know where the great reviews are from. I got this one from ebay from same seller....Its a punishment to put together with the million parts...On top of that these keep breaking off...I just use it as a sofa...if I have to move it around it starts breaking..SO even when I have guest which I why I really got this..They prefer sleeping on the floor with just the mattress than on this unstable and easily broken POS...I can't even sell it because its so flimsy that it will break in the process of transporting. Might as well add in a $100 more and get a sofa bed or a proper mattress set. DOnt be fooled like me.
2,not happy,"I was very upset to find my latest purchase of onxrt live from the archives vol. 7 came with a badly damaged case, this was to be a gift. If I was aware of this I would have bought a different one. Customers should be informed of things like this,This makes me not want to buy thru amazon again!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,So Disappointed,"I was so disappointed with the quality of this movie. The animation and voices are terrible. The story line is not even close to as good as the other movies. The Holly Hobbie series has been my girls favorite, but now I don't think we will buy them anymore. They are not worth the money if they continue to make them like this. Does anyone know who we could send a formal complaint too?"
2,outdated,nice book but the info is old and outdated. so you better be sure your allowed to drop your pants before you do. other wise you may find a bunch of old ladies yelling for help or even worse laughing at you
2,Not Compatible with PSP 2000,This product does not work on the PSP 2000. The remote control jack does not fit in the PSP. A reminder for those going to purchase this item.
1,Why not let us know!!!!,"this unit was useless as it is not compatable with the 2001 and up models of the psp,,it was a waste of my time and my money to purchase something that dose not work...PSP Headphones with Remote Control (White)"
3,PSP Headphones,Seemed like a good product overall and shipping was very quick but this product is NOT compatible with the newer PSP2. We had to return the product for this reason and it could have been mentioned in the description.
2,Not for PSP3,"Remote control doesn't work for PSP2 or PSP3, so You'd got to unplug it and use it like universal headphones."
1,Doesn't fit all PSPs,"Does not fit my PSP. It would not go in the headphone jack all the way, so it cannot work correctly."
5,Great 5 Stars,"Great! I just got it and love it! It said it was going to be DVD-R but it was not (Which was good). A lot of you are complaining it's only half a season but its FOUR HOURS of Rugrats. They have to make another set because it would've been like six discs, so give Amazon Credit. Plus a lot of people are complaining about no special features, and no music/video menu. I like it, it takes you back to the glory days when you got all the Rugrats VHS's. So I'd give this 5 out of 5 stars. Some of the best episodes! Thanks Amazon/Nickelodeon! I love this!"
1,Proper Release? What Gives?,"Just like Nickelodeon to take the best season of the best franchise that was created for their channel and not even give it a proper ""season"" release. In an era of full season releases and full seasons readily available on the internet, it seems odd they won't even release all the episodes for their seasons on Itunes or Netflix...Makes one wonder where they stand financially."
5,This video saved my life,"I bought this video almost ten years ago and it has seriously changed my life. I was diagnosed with carpal tunnel and arthritis around that time and they suggested surgery, today I am surgery free. Anytime i feel pain, I do this video and it is like magic. It has helped me with everything from sore hands to constipation to a sore neck. I love it and would recommend to anyone!"
2,No mention of Used Condition,There was no mention in the description that this is an used item. I could get this kind of used breakers locally for cheaper...
4,Subtle but Sexy,"I used another scent for 25 years until it was no longer made and had to shop for and sniff many perfumes before I found Arpege Eau de Parfum. It is delightful, never overbearing, subtle and sexy.Since using Arpege, I don't miss my other perfume at all.EK[...]"
2,Disappointed,"I've worn Arpege for many years. What a wonderful scent. But the bottle of Arpege I received from Amazon.com wasn't as pictured (it was black, not clear), and the smell was different: spicier without those wonderful flowery topnotes. I wonder, did I receive a dud or has the Lanvin company changed the formula without the consumer's permission?? Because the bottle has been opened, it isn't returnable according the to Amazon.com rules."
4,"An inexpensive CD player, fine for a young child's room.","We purchased this CD player to play CDs and soft music at bedtime for our child. For the price, it's not bad. As stated in a previous review - it does lack bass. Also no digital radio but the reception is very good. It's also compact and the buttons are small enough that the kids won't fool around with it."
1,Stopped after 3 Months,"Bought this at Christmas 2001. By mid-March, it would not work. IF the time displayed, it was 18:88. (Since this is in another review, it must be a common failure mode.) The radio and CD player would not work either.DO NOT buy this product. Select another clock/radio/CD."
3,"Good, but definitely NOT their best one","I bought GBS ""Rant and Roar"" and immediately became a rabid fan. What a great album, and so infectiously rollicking! This one is good, but MUCH slower and somewhat darker. Consequence Free is the GBS I am used to, but the rest is going to take a while to grow on me. I was kind of disappointed that I didn't order ""Up"" instead. Oh well. It's still Great Big Sea."
1,Grade Z home made exploitation-groundbreaking MYAAAASS,"I agree with the other ONE STAR raters of this ""film""--Whatever it's intent, cultural timing or underground anti-establishment accolades--the film is TERRIBLE--Terrible in EVERY way--there are no redeeming qualities to speak of--It is a miracle anyone knows anything about this film all these decades later--Great films made during this era have been 90% forgotten, while this is revered--don't get it!"
1,Only Serves To Nauseate,"This may be the least watchable film I have ever seen. This was recommended to a friend by Amazon because of our purchases of the comparatively enlightening and morally uplifting Dolemite videos. This movie begins by condoning the statutory rape of a ten year old boy, and descends to new depths of film depravity. The one recurring theme in this film is: RUNNING! YES! How exciting can in get watching Sweet run for what seems like hours. This belongs exactly where we put our copy:in the garbage."
1,Dont waste your money,"A piece of junk. The movie was banned (by an all white jury) and i see why (and i'm black). I think Melvin was full of himself since most of the shots were of him running around town all dressed up in his fly 70's fit. I thought i was going to learn something from this film but instead, what i got was a porno. It was disgusting enough they had a seen that opened up with a very young boy sexin' a grown woman and showing his manhood. I seen a whole lot of manhood in this film (if thats what ya wanna call it..i wasnt impressed). Hopefully the remake will be alot better. This was pure junk."
4,Not bad...,"The Seb is back indeed considering this album is much better than his previous one, but I was not wowed like I was with Prototype 1 and 2. The first song on disk 2 made me very annoyed. How many times can you repeat the words: Chicago, Detroit, New York in one song??? I'll tell you: 30 times in less than 8 minutes. That's just wrong. Therefore, considering the lack of ""wow"" factor and such amazingly annoying repetition on song one of disk 2, this CD deserves a 4. Try a little harder Seb!"
1,''BEWARE'' NOT A MAGAZINE-BUT A FLYER,I'm a little disappointed I purchased this for my dad for father's day I thought it was a magazine but it's actually a 6 page flyer with 3 holes on the side to put in a binder. I just think it's a little pricey for a flyer but he said he enjoys it and the information is good.
2,Not Now...I'm Having a No Hair Day,Disappointed. I found more laughter in my own personal experience with cancer treatment and hair loss than I found in these pages. I laughed out loud once. I expected more.In contrast I found another book: No More Bad Hair Days to be very wise AND very funny. Just the ticket!
3,Yearning to see pop-up video,"I've always enjoyed the few pop-up videos i've seen in the past and was delighted to see (on VH1 classics) they had 2 pop-up video lists. I watched a couple and decided I wouldn't watch them all at once so I would have something to look forward to in the following days. Then I found to my great disappointment the videos would no longer play! I then had the idea that there might be a pop-up video dvd on Amazon.com, and there was! This dvd has 11 pop-up videos on it and comments from the people that put the pop-ups on them. However, even though they say they picked the best videos, I think they picked the worst. what's with all the English videos on here? I will hope to find a way to see the many American videos I haven't seen."
1,I'd rather eat gristle,"This by far the worst movie ever forced up the American movie goer! The worse part is that I bought it without renting it first! My friend liked it a little but he is legally blind.Mansewer E. Ramsewer should have been in this movie, that wouldof made it a complete disaster."
4,problems fixed,I purchased the machine through one of Amazon's vendors. The machine didn't perform to expectations. I sent it back and the company was very nice and sent a replacement right away. I'm very happy with the replacement machine. This technology is getting harder and harder to find so I hope this one lasts until I retire.
2,headphone jack broke on two identical models,"I have heard the high pitch squeals other reviewers mentioned when using the foot pedal, but I am only hearing it on the left side, since the headphone jack on both of my machines seems to have broken."
2,Machine works fine foot pedal another story.,"I have had this machine just over 1 month and have been using it between 3-5 days a week, and it worked just fine.This morning the foot pedal decided to rewind back to the beginning of the tape every time I let my foot off it. Playback works fine if I disconnect the foot pedal, but I have to manually press play and rewind.The rewind works really well and doesn't require a lot of repeating phrases.Called Panasonic customer support to request a new foot pedal and got hung up on."
4,Volleyball Net,Great fit to our outdoor court. Was hard to find a 25 foot net so we were thrilled when this one was available and at such a great price! Have only used it one season but it did well so far.
5,Explains mysteries into every day language and awareness.,"No longer are we afforded the luxury of living in a monastery/ashram etc in order to work on our spiritual growth. This book helps you to work with your own evolutionary (kundalini) energy and still raise a family, work a job and have a life. The meditations are easy for even the least disciplined person. The explainations of how to move this energy through your body for greater healing work better than any I have found so far. One of the best spiritual practice books I've read in the last 30 years!"
1,Calumet Photo STINKS Beware Amazon sells you their product,"I bought some film from Amazon for my daughter as a gift, I ordered the wrong film 120 instead of 35mm. As soon as my daughter saw the box she knew it was wrong. I tried to exchange the un-opened box of film and they said NO!!!!!!!!!!And Amazon could not help either. BEWARE Amazon says Returns are easy as one two three.....BS"
2,A lot of advices bundled together,"The only good advice this book gives you is how you should combine weightlifting and cycling throughout the year. It does so by illustrating different exercises, but no schedules or programs are provided. Interesting, but the rest of the off-season advices are more how you do it than why you should do it. How will a certain exercise make me a better cyclist? That is what I want to know. It seems like a lot of good advices have been bundled together and thus lacking an overall plan. Sorry, but I expected more from Ed Burke."
1,Bummer - Borla Stainless dual exhaust,"I bought this for an extra nice looking dual Stainless Steel tailpipe without restriction & intercooled to provide a nice tone on my Mini Cooper S.Unfortunately, I never installed it due to the poor attention to detail in construction.Large & obtrusive welds attached the center supports of the outlets making it look hand welded & not very well, supports weren't angled or spaced evenly.Had I installed it, it would make my car look worse, and I like it now, just wanted non-OEM & a bit better.In all, it looked like a cheap Borla replica attempt & I immediately used Amazon's retuen policy.It was supposed to be a Borla part, so now I'm not so keen on buying Borla. It could have been a cheap imitation attempt.Too bad, I had already shown the picture & talked about installing this it looked soooo good, live & learn.Good luck,Stan"
4,A little different,"I have just recently started reading Danielle steel. I like her way of writing. In the beginning up until the princess was killed, I was so much into story but as soon as the affair between Andreas and Venessa started I was turned off. I don't think i can digest that portion. Somehow it felt like voilation of the relationships. I don't understand and like one of the last statement andreas said to her""In you hearts you will take me with you. You have been dear to me as a child. Now you will remember me for a liftime.""It didn't feel right. She was a kid when he met her and he couldn't possibly have feelings for her at that time. Now after she is grown up ......The portion after she met andreas, it felt like it was written in hurry. Everything happened so fast and I can't digest that."
3,"Dream, the music & lyrics of Johnny Mercer","A nice set of songs by Mr Mercer. Some of the older performers sounded just that, ""old"" but as it was a charity concert good luck to them. on the other hand some of the lesser known performers ( to me that is) sounded a bit thin on it. More like ""Idol"" contestants."
1,I wish there was a zero stars for durable!,"My daughter got this for Christmas and we picked out beads to match her outfit. It worked great for the first 3 strands, but something snapped on the forth strand and that was it. She was terribly disappointed. I doubt the clips would have stayed in very long as they seemed loose. We exchanged for a similar product from a different company and have been much happier.Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,A big disappointment to a 6 year old girl on Christmas day!,"My daughter got this for Christmas and was so excited that we had to take it with us when we went to have our family Christmas lunch. We sat there in the living room, surrounded by family as my daughter excitedly waited for me to get the thing set up. We strung beads on once.....yay! That was cool! Let's do it again! Twice....weeeee! Look at my hair! Three times....sorry honey, your present no longer works, that's it!"
5,"Funny, sexy, and definitely worth the read","I really enjoyed this book. Many people do live by the code of ""what will the neighbors think?"" I found this book to be truthful about that one point. The characters are written very well. Some of them, I could see in people around me. I have not read a book in a long time that could combine sexy and funny as well."
4,A Keeper,"This book is full length for the genre (over 300 pgs), so I am not rereading it at this time. But I will. I just opened up the book in 3 different places and found 3 great scenes. Great dialogue. There are over 70 reviews written to date, so if you want in depth analysis... If not, buy the book and enjoy the read."
1,Tedious Reading(blah!),"I thank God that I am not, nor do I know anyone, like the main character, Maddie. She was more immature than her 8yo daughter Emily, a bad example to mothers and wives everywhere, and an uninteresting character as a whole. This entire story revolves around the ""what will the neighbors think?"" mentality. Maddie lives in unreasonable fear of what her mother will say about what she does and is in such denial of her entire life... Even C.L.'s unbelievable claim of hopeful love couldn't save this book. The one star was for Jennifer Crusie's effort and actually getting this book published."
1,Boring And A Waste of Two Hours,I have read some of her other books which I have enjoyed. But this one was so boring it was putting me to sleep. If I had read this one first I wouldn't have read any of her other books. What is so funny about a woman who rationalizes that it is ok to commit adultery becuase her husband did it first. I guess the people that thought it was funny were sniffing laughing gas because there wasn't anything funny about this book.
2,annoying lead woman character,"I have enjoyed her books before and even laughed out loud, but this book left me frustrated and bored. I continued to read it in hopes that it would get better. The main character, Maddie, was not intelligent and she was so intent on protecting her reputation, she committed crimes! She did not seem to have much of a backbone and she was a very poor role model for any young woman. She made possibly the worst decisions possible every page!"
3,Sensational scarfs,The book is helpful but I was hoping for a more complete update of scarf wear so was disappointed when I got the book.
2,"Dated material, poorly presented","I actually bought this book twice, once 8 years ago (since lost in various moves). Frankly, the info here is dated, weakly presented, and in serious need of revision. The 'world marks' are well out of date, for one. Save your money, what you probably need is (now) available free, for Googling."
1,Bad,"They send me the wrong parts( they are to big), and the problem is I don't have time to ship those back, I guess I'm stuck with the wrong parts!!!"
1,Stopped working after 2 months,"I was trusting in Yamaha's reputation. Plus, the online reviews for this product seemed favorable. However, after only a couple of months use, this CD player started not recognizing discs. It started not recognizing discs (dispaying ""NO DISC"" even though there was a disc inserted) in slot 2 only. As the weeks went by, however, this spread to the other slots, and now the player will not play any discs I put in it in any of the slots. It's just totally broken. Because it's past the deadline for returning it to Amazon, it goes in the trash tomorrow -- what a waste -- and I unfortunately have to buy another CD player. Maybe I'll go cheaper this time -- at least then I won't have high expectations, and won't be out so much money, if it doesn't work."
1,cheaply built.,"I have had this model for about two years and the disc carrier will no longer close! I am a long time serious listener to primarily classical music and am gentle with my equipment. The sound was o.k., but to have it built in such a flimsy manner is a shame, esp., when one considers the cost."
5,Everything I hoped and wanted...,"Consumer Reports felt that this was a ""good buy"" and we purchased it for our father for Christmas. Amazon not only had a good price for it but was able to get it to me in plenty of time to get it set up for our father. All around good experience and purchase."
1,skips,this was a bummer. the CD player skipped right out of the box. I took it in for service and learned that Yamaha does not authorize online sales and the warranty would not be honored.
1,If you like to spend excess $$$,If you won the lottery or perhaps were a celebrity who didn't want to be seen at the store .. these are your coconuts! Save the bucks.. send the chauffeur to the asian market.. give the spare change to the homeless or some charity... coconuts run around $1.00 to $3.99 depending on locale.. geez Louise..
1,Not Fresh,"My Phillipino nanny was very disappointed. The water was good, but the meat was old and rubbery. The shelf life was only 2-3 days before turning color. Worst purchase I've made on Amazon."
4,"Best Young Coconut Ever, but also most expensive","I also had to pay for shipping (and I rushed it, to get them as fresh as possible). This meant I literally paid over $50 for three coconuts, a ridiculous price indeed! They were also the freshest, tastiest young coconuts I've ever encounted before or since. You will not find a coconut this fresh in any market unless you happen to live near the tropics.However, if you don't mind a little processing and don't have fifty bucks to throw away, you can find coconut water (with slices of coconut) in most Asian markets. Look for the good stuff, it's a clear plastic cup, similar to a yoghurt cup, with a thin cover of plastic film sealed on the top. Don't buy the crap in cans or anything that looks like it should go in a child's lunchbox! Sometimes they will dehydrate a little of the water so it can be a bit sweeter than fresh. It will still taste closer to fresh than the young coconuts you can buy in the same market."
3,NOT FULLSCREEN!,"Nowhere in the product description could I find the actual format before buying, so I had to keep my fingers crossed while waiting for it to arrive. Alas, I was disappointed to receive a widescreen format, which was not my preference. Oh, well."
1,Very Dissapointed,You all have to understand that these DVD's will only play on the very latest of DVD players! I am SO bummed as we cannot even play this on a 3 year old DVD player.......very poor planning on their part....you too will likely be dissapointed!!
4,Excelente precio y buen set de películas para los seguidores de Harry Potter,"El set de películas es una excelente oportunidad para quienes son seguidores de Harry Potter, a un excelente precio en Amazon para quienes quieren adquirir la colección del maguito inglés. La calidad de imagen es inmejorable tratándose de blue ray y los discos incluyen buenas características especiales.En cuanto a las películas por absurdo que parezca, al tratarse de una historia de magia, desde mi perspectiva carecen de ""realismo"", o mejor dicho credibilidad, desde los efectos especiales, trama y congruencia, pero entiendo perfectamente que no soy el público meta para la historia. Quizás para una audiencia infantil o juvenil, puedan ser películas atractivas."
4,A little disappointed...,"I was very excited to own the movies that have come out so far, but I was a little disappointed to find that there are scenes missing in these movies. I'm a big Harry Potter fan, and this is a good deal, I just wish they were all the complete movies."
3,Just Ho-Hum,"Although some of the situations were strange and funny, the story just seemed to wander along to an uneventful ending. I know this was real life on the road, but the author failed to keep my interest in the flow of the story."
5,"A fascinating, sobering perspective","I thoroughly enjoyed this book and even when I wanted to put it down, because it was so troubling to read, I couldn't do so because I was quickly engulfed by the story. I was hooked immediately by the clear pure voice of Jasmina.As she describes her home town and her life there before the war, I was struck by the sereneness of the town and the love and sense of belonging everyone who lived there had.The nightmare that followed is unbelievable. To read a first person account tears out your heart, but you have to keep reading to find out how it ends.At the end, I felt outraged at what happened but privileged to have been given this piece of understanding into a situation, which I hope never to encounter."
1,Terrible!!!,This is honestly the worst book I have ever read. Just the thought of the author makes me nauseous. I strongly recommend that no one purchase this book.
3,Dynasty Warriors for PSP is not as good as console Dynasty Warriors.,"Simply put, this Dynasty Warriors game for the PSP is not as fun as the other games for the PS2 and the Xbox. It is just a little too different than the original. It is a good substitute when one can not play it, such as on the road, but not very good if the original can be played. The originals are always better."
1,David Leadbetter #1 of Faults and Fixes Vol 1 VHS-2001,"How can you review something you cannot hear nor get a visual picture of? It was as though it were camcorded on the cheapest camera, off of a TV screen. We are out our money, needless to say, I will never order another golf VHS from this site again. I ordered it through AMAZON but another company sent it. By the way, the other golf video I ordered never arrived, again, through AMAZON, but another outlet. I trust Amazon, but not the affiliates."
4,"step forward, cough backward","Items are gone and replaced with general enhancement slots. other than that, you willn't be surprised by anything else here. welcome addition s include mutiple-vectored musuo gauges qnd special stance attacks, however it must be noted that i've always felt every iteration of samurai warriors but a prelude to the grander and (always) better and more comfortable Dynasty Warriors. People migh dissagree, but hey, screw them. I'll still be killing these Japanese until the next version of China come out, hopefully for the ps3, and i'llbe killing em with gusto so thats not a negative. It's just that, truth be told, slaughtering Chinese is more fun that slaughtering Japanese: there are just more of 'em!"
2,Lacks on cars,"I have Ridge Racer 5 , there are only 6 cars in the game. They're really fast but they still look the same when you custimize them. Although the gameplay is great but there isnt a reverse button. Get Gran Turismo 2000 instead, Im gonna trade my RR5 for GT2000"
4,Hardcore racing fans only,"This is an excelent game, but not if you aren't crazy about racing. I love racing games and I am finding it a little difficult. I would recommend this game to hardcore racing gamers only. If you didn't like the other Ridge Racers then hang on until GT3. I think this is one of the best racing games ever, but we all have different opinions and this is mine... BUY, BUY, BUY!"
2,Not the greatest,"Compared to the other racing games avalible for the playstation 2 this one just doesn't match up. Granted it can be fun, but I would look into other games first"
1,just plain bad,"The worst game I've ever played. It is hard to control and you spin out all the time. Most of the tracks aren't that exciting either. Really, don't get it."
2,"not awful, just more of the same","The RR series has always been sort of self-explanatory. Realistic looking cars in a realistic environment, but playing like an arcade racer. No great amount of depth (like the Gran Turismo series) but not quite as cartoony as Beetle Adventure Racing or Top Gear Overdrive.This is just more of the same. Is it the best looking RR ever? Yeah, and it should be, given that its the only PS2 version of the bunch. And, truth be told, it should look better. It does score above-average marks in the style department, but the highly Japanese flavor to it might turn off some gamers. Basically it is what it is: another Ridge Racer game. Type 4 was good for PSX, and a lot of people expected more from this one, but didn't get ""the next level"" of RR games, just another in a series.If you want a decent racing game, wait for Gran Turismo 3, or if you've been a RR devotee, then by all means go for this one. For most gamers it's a ""been there, done that"" kinda thing."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I wanted something to fill in the time before GT3 came out. I feel cheated. The music is lame. The cars are lame. The tracks are lame. The cars don't act right. This was a total waste of my time and money. I tried to leave the blank in the rating field but Amazon wouldn't let me, so I gave it one star."
1,Groomers beware,"This is an ok book for new people, but it has several safty issues, and doesn't have the show cuts for many dogs, poodles. It also has the wrong cuts from some of the dogs. There are better books out there."
1,"It skips, it sounds bad, it doesnt work as advertised","I bought this CD player for my wife to use during our jogging treks outdoors. I bought it based on positive reviews and the price - this was a mistake. To begin, the sound is definately not the best - without the bass boost, the sound is similar to the original AM radio my father had in his 1965 GMC pickup, with the bass boost, the sound is sub-par at best. Now the real problem - the anti skip feature simply does not work. When she accelerated to a very light jog, the system started skipping - even if she cradled the player like a bird egg, the thing still skipped. Bottom line: don't buy this one - spend the extra money and buy something with a solid reputation - I've has great luck with my AIWA player for more than a year now - it didn't cost that much more and it has never skipped during a jog."
5,intelligent music,Sorry about the pompous title but I implore you to listen to this man's music.All his work contains moments of lyrical brilliance and beauty.Enthralling storytelling from an artist whose relative lack of fame is incomprehensible.Listen to all the records but this live set is a good introduction that should seduce you.
5,Ronan Keating,"Is this Ronan's only solo album? If there are more, could you please e-mail me at Kellyfh02@aol.com Thanks so much!"
5,"A little outdated, but still the definitive PC construction guide","I speak from the viewpoint of a novice PC builder. Newer motherboards, improved sockets, and evolving interfaces have not altered the fact that this remains an excellent guide for the novice that is building a PC. Excellent photos, clear text, and an engaging style make this a must-have book."
1,Out of Date,Simply too dated. There are better articles on the internet that are both free and current.
5,Stunning Portraits,This is a small book. The pages are 7 1/4 X 4 7/8. The right hand page contains a stunning borderless image. The left page is blank except for a one line label. Each image demands to be studied. While there is no descriptive text the image can tell its own story. Don't rush through this book but sit and ponder. At the price it is a genuine bargain. Highly recommended.
5,Worth it,"The cover of the book is spectacular and inside is getting better, is a piece of art for the ones that love photografy or simple want to get impressed."
1,"Toolbox for obsolete, unsupported mapping format","This software was rendered obsolete by Rand Mcnally when they merged with another company and abandoned this mapping format. Otherwise, it filled a need to edit locally significant details onto maps."
1,DONT buye this!,"No doubt, Googoosh is still the greatest artist persia.Nevertheless, I have never in my life seen such a ater dvd. Apparently the manufacturer has no idea of art!"
2,Some fun but little substance,"Def Jam Icon was one of the earliest PS3 games I bought (and was one of the earlier releases) so it's aged considerably. It doesn't support rumble for the DualShock 3 and has some horrible load times. It's got a story mode which fans of these rappers would probably enjoy, but to me it's just silly. The main reason I bought the game was for the 2 player versus mode. It has a handful of locations to fight, the graphics are pretty good, and the destruction effects are great. The load times for versus mode are absolutely abysmal, it takes a really long time just to load your rapper at the select screen, and then the level itself takes additional time.I'd say this game is worth $15 or so, it's fun to play with friends, but don't expect much depth."
1,There's only ONE redeeming quality...,"I rented this game when it came out, expecting it to be somewhere near half as good as its two predecessors, Vendetta and Fight For NY. What I got instead was a pathetic attempt at mixing the button-press-sync games of the late nineties like Parappa the Rapper with a poorly thrown together fighting game. Worst fighting game I've ever played, hands down. The control scheme is lacking any sense or explanation, and the fact that the somehow anthropomorphic environment jumps around and ""dances"" to the music in a manner reminiscent of Super Mario makes the game childish...to the point you almost want to give up on the whole ""adults can like rap too"" argument. The only cool thing about this game is that once you get used to the repetitive stupidity of the gameplay and manage to learn how to efficiently attack, you can beat the tar out of that annoying T.I. dude. Still, even if you hate the guy, it's not even worth a cent."
5,Five Stars +++,"I just happened to notice that Kozol only has an average review of four and a half stars for this book, and I just couldn't live with myself if I didn't add my five. I would give it a hundred if I could. This book is, well, it's simply amazing. Heart-breaking, life-changing. Highly recommended."
5,It just doesn't get any better!,"This is easily the BEST album I have bought in a long, long time. Just one MAJOR complaint, it isn't a full length album. We need more material like this, dare I say that this is even better than anything Matheos, Vera and Portnoy have done recently in their respective bands, Fates and Dream Theater. John should definetely come back with a full length album with these guys. If you're a fan of progressive rock and metal then you MUST own this album. Think Fates around the Specter and Guardian days but better. The songs are nice and long though so it isn't a short disc. It's just that a full length album of this caliber is what is much needed today. I'm going to go listen to it right now!"
3,Misleading,"I was hoping to find the orignal ""gonna have a funky good time"" (looking at the title"" and did not. Although the tracks are good it wasn't what I was looking for. Not looking for the live version. Song titles not listed."
4,Beavis & Butthead or 911 who's the joke?,"One of the only cartoons I watched in the 90's.Mainly cause I was drunk whenever I watched it.This will go down in history as the most moroniccartoon made in the 90's, even though they are funny!!I rate this Cartoon a 4 of 5 stars!!"
5,Men's book club enjoyed it,My men's book club chose this book as its nonfiction selection of the month. 7 of 8 men felt that the book added to their appreciation of women's issues. The presentation--folktales paired with short essays on strong contemporary women--gave insights we felt to be valuable.
2,All the specs but can't get good sound.,"I bought it cause a 2.4 GHz phone with Spread spectrum should have just about perfect clarity and good range. Plus it was ~$$$ on sale. Here is a perfect example of how the company couldn't produce a quality product. We had the phone 1 day. I can't get more than 2 rooms away without getting ""skips"" in the sound. Gee.... my 900 MHz spread spectrum beats it hands down. So this one> is a [inexpensive] 2.4 ghz phone!It works good for about 40 feet. Liked the answering machine.Go buy something else!"
1,Terrible Phone,"This is a terrible phone, don't waste your money on this! Don't be fooled by the 2.4Ghz or the DSS features, they're all a waste after you hear the quality of the phone. Constant hissing, echoes and just terrible sound quality. I returned it after only 2 days and 2 phone calls. Check the reviews of the GH2415 or the GH2410 at circuitcity.com, essentially the same phone except w/o the answering machine. AVOID!!"
2,Oh the humanity!,"Oh man, TDF went totally off course with this one. They are no longer doing their trademark screaming vocals. That's right, they went poppy! If you like totally melodic vocals then you'll like this. But for fans of TDF you'll most likely find it disappointing."
5,Viva Los Mel-tones!,I have been looking for this CD for a while. I am a big fan of The Mel-tones and this is a really great CD!
5,Canning Bible,This book contains everything you could possibly ever want to know about canning. It's great for a beginner or someone more experiened. A must-have for any canner!
5,Happy to recover recipe,I did find some loss recipes that I used over 40 years ago. My family missed eating them and they were delighted when I sent them some of the canned food. I discovered that I will need to can more because what I sent didn't last them two weeks. I sent them all 2 pints of corn relish. Most of 42 pints I canned a month ago is gone.
1,Out of date. Significant changes made in 2009,"This USDA publication has been updated in 2009 and the one for sale was published 1994. After the fact, I received UDSA, NIFA, Agriculture Information Bulletin No. 539 listing significant changes in every one of the seven sections pertaining to food safety &/or quality. This rendered the entire book unfit to use as a researched based reference. Knowing that the version I was purchasing was the 1994 version, and I did not realize the differences until after the book arrived, I ended up throwing out the book because I did not feel it was safe to even sell it at a yard sale. I have since acquired the 2009 version of the same book through my local County Extension Service Office."
2,This is the 1994 edition!,"By the Publishing Date (2008), I assumed that this was a newer edition. I wasn't expecting a reprint of the 1994 USDA Bulletin #539 - 14 years older than the Publishing Date. This should be made clear in the book's information."
1,so tight,Its a new system in which you already have everything you need and most games don't have that and its very tight
4,"Durable toy, fun music","My son received this toy when he was close to 6 months old, but he's just now giving it more attention. He's 15 months and loves anything with a screen (laptops, cell phones, house phone, ipods, etc). He's always trying to get our cell phones from us, but then just realized that he had this toy in his toy box. Its been his favorite ever since and carries it all throughtout the house.He loves the music and is constantly laughing and dancing with it. He holds it up to his ear and I was concerned at first with the noise, but it really is not that bad. Most songs are short and by the time he gets it up to his ear, its mostly over."
1,Too loud for little ears...,"I think this is much too loud for a child who may put it up to his/her ear as a phone (which my son loves to do). I found this out the hard way on myself. I do not allow him to play with on now, if at all. Otherwise, I have no problem with it."
2,not much bang for the buck,"I saw a similar Fisher-Price phone which was larger with more features for about the same price in a retail store. Purchased this exact item only because it was requested by name ""Laugh & Learn"" by an ""angel tree"" recipient at church."
5,the fisher price learning phone,it is great my son loves it and i love it because he enjoys it. It's educational and it keeps him busy.
4,Great for road trip,"We got this toy phone when Jack was 9 months old, because he kept grabbing for the phone when ever we were on it.He is 15 months old now and still plays with it on road trips to the Beach and Mountains.A must for a busy baby, who starting to explore his new world."
2,Can't hear it!,"I bought this phone for my daughter because she loves to play with my cell phone. It was great, at first, for its learning activities, but the volume on it is horrible. The room has to be completely silent in order to hear it. Then, about two weeks later it stopped working all together. Don't waste your money!"
3,Sounds louder in store,"I also thought that the phone was much louder when I bought it than when my daughter opened it and we removed it out of the box. I soon found out why. It says in the instruction manual, that the phone is set loud as a display but when you open the box and it is removed, the volume adjusts to a comfort level good for children. This would be wonderful if you have one child and she has a quiet environment, but my little girl has to put this up when friends/cousins are over, b/c it is useless. Other than volume problem, the toys is cute and very educational."
3,Okay toy but volume is too low,"My daughter loves anything that has buttons on it that she can push, so she somewhat likes this toy. However, it might as well not make any sounds because you can't hear them. She will play with it for a minute or so but then gets bored and goes on to something else."
1,Very Disapointed!!,This would probably be a great toy if my son could hear it. You absolutely can not hear a single thing. I also thought the batteries were dead. It still did not help. I called FP and they said they have been getting tons of complaints on this - but that it is working properly. I will be returning it to the store. My son also has the laugh and learn house which he loves..
4,My child likes it!,"My little one received this on his first birthday and has really enjoyed it. The volume is quite low because it is supposed to be a phone and it could be harmful if held up to the ear with a louder volume. My child thinks it is funny if adults pretend to use this as a phone, but he just likes to hold it and play with it like a baby version of a game boy. My child loves buttons and this toy rewards his button pushing with lights - so cool when you are one year old! The toy is also designed to teach numbers and letters and has music, too. Quite a variety for a small, compact toy. Now, I don't really know how much my child will actually learn from this phone, but he does have fun playing with it. The low volume is also welcome change from the ""millions"" of very noisey toys that we have! This is a toy that I would feel comfortable taking to some of the places that I would never take other noise making toys."
2,too quiet,"The toy would be wonderful IF you could hear it. It is so quiet, even when its just me and my child, I can barely hear the sound. When I called Fisher Price, I thought it was defective. I was told it is supposed to be that way to keep from 'damaging' a child's hearing. It is much too soft for the child to hear what it says."
2,Can't hear it!,"I thought this would be a great addition for my daughter, but you cannot even hear the telephone unless you put it up to your ear. I don't know many little kids that do that. They prefer to push the buttons and watch the display... I'll be calling Fisher Price on this one:("
2,volume is too low,I am returning this toy when it was still in the box in demonstration mode it was a good volume then when I unwrapped and took it out of demonstration mode it was too low you can barely hear the abc's. my daughter was bored with this quickly
3,Worth the read,This was an okay book. There could have been MORE romance. It could have explored different venues of the relationships of the girls and guys and it could have gone a lot deeper instead of staying on the surface.But I think it will be a perfect read for a teen or pre-teen!
4,Book great for teens,"I felt this book really shows a different side of teenagers. It was very detailed and showed two sides of the characters. Summer Boys, Is a great novel just to read. Its not compliacted nor thought provoking.The book, talks about girls who have boy trouble, drama with eachotoher while their down at the beach over the summer. The way Summer Boys is written is different but at the same time interseting. One chapter is about one girl and the next is another one but the fourth chapter might start where the girl had left off in the first. It sounds complicated but it is really not. I highly recomend this book"
5,What is the Point of Being Christian?,"A well crafted work, wide ranging in its scope, and at the same time well organized. The author writes as a witness to gospel values, with feet firmly planted on the ground. His perspectives on global issues is right on target. Truly a book well worth purchasing."
5,ONE OF THE BEST PSP GAMES.,"THE GAMEPLAY: GOOD GAMEPLAY AND THERE IS LOADS AND LOADS OF VIOLENCE. YOU CAN SEE THE ZOMBIES BODY PARTS FLY WHEN YOU SHOT THEM AND THERE IS ALSO ALOT OF BLOOD WHEN YOU SHOOT THEM TO. THE SOUND: PRETTY GOOD SOUND WITH GREAT MUSIC FROM BANDS LIKE SLIKP KNOT. THE GRAPHICS: GOOD BUT NOT GREAT BUT, STILL GOOD.ALSO IN THE GAME YOU MAKE YOUR OWN OFFCIER AND THERE ARE OFFICERS YOU CAN UNLOCK AND CUSTIMIZE AND THERE ARE EVEN MEMBERS FROM SLIKP KNOT YOU CAN UNLOKC AND PLAY AS! ANOTHER GREAT THING ABOUT THIS GAME IS THAT IT HAS WI-FI WITCH MEANS YOU CAN PLAY AGINST YOUR FRIENDS TO. THIS GAME IS A GAMERS MUST HAVE I GIVE IT A 10/10."
4,Best value for money,This one's got more bass than others in its price range. Good sound and looks! ...!!
5,first gundam,"but not my last... this was a much better model than i expected. very nice detail, stable joints, awsome weapons. its the same model as the 22 dollar astray 1/144 red frame, but this model comes with beam sword blades. oddly the 22 dollar one doesnt. to bad the pic on this is so terrible. it took me about 2 1/2 hrs to build and stands about 5 inchs. over all i realy like this model, and will keep collecting the 1/144 kits. i have warrior zaku on the way... so watch out for my reveiw on it."
5,Exhaust Jack,"This appears to be a good idea, however, it will not fit my exhaust pipe and I have been unable to find an air compressor adapter. I had a hard time contacting the people that import this and when they finally did answer they no longer carry this product and they do not have the ""OPITIONAL"" air compressor adapter. Not worth anything."
3,Good book,"This is a very small, slender book. Given that most books of this genre (hair and makeup) tend to be big, with big pictures, I was surprised. That being said, it does have some good braiding designs in it."
5,Hard to find waterbed items,I needed the waterbed conditioner for my wateerbed and it is very hard to find anyone local that carried it. The order was delivered quickly and as promised.
2,Qty. vs. quality,I can only hope this product is the best out there. I have shot glasses that are bigger. The info for this didn't give any indication that it's only a 4 oz. container. A lot of $$ between price and shipping. Not one of my better selections.
4,Transcend raises many ethical questions,"Richard Joseph paints clear and textured scenes which he gathered from his world travels. There are episodes in the Grand Canyon, South Korea, and China to name a few; these chapters bring to light characteristic which I believe are univesral in their humanity. His experiences are ones which challenge the reader to coinsider each situation as new."
5,"Psalms, Hymns & Spirituak Songs","It was a very moving and rewarding CD. I can listen, shout and praise God while watching it."
4,Ceramic 4-piece dipping set,"This was purchased for a gift, so I have not used it, nor even removed it from the box; but the box (the product box, not the outer box) was received damaged. Very dented, although the product did not appear to be damaged....Thank you,Joanne"
1,Disappointing,"Not much more than a sugar pill. Basically useless, even at 6 to 8 pills at a time. Waste of money."
1,A Cheap Shot to Hannah Arendt,"Even though Mr. Cesarani's book, historically speaking, is not bad, I give it only one star because of the cheap shot to Hanna Arendt.It is a fallacy for the pygmy to blame the giant of his shortcomings.Charges of prejudice against ""ostjuden"" by Arendt during the Eichmann trial, who now can't defend herself, are in the realm of ""cheap shot"". Besides, they are wrong. Wasn't this the same Ms. Arendt that went out of her way to return to Europe and help all Jews with Youth Aliya? Cesarani, on the contrary, likes to complain. Ms. Arendt was really guilty of having one of the subtlest and more penetrating intellects of the 20th century, leaving little ""space"" for certain historians."
1,"Weak, out of date","This book is superficial, weak, and out of date. It skips over many newer developments and the ""Where the field is headed"" sections often focus on research that is twenty years old. I hate to pick on the authors because writing a good book is difficult, but this book makes me doubt they have much recent experience in the field.I had to buy this for school and plan to sell it back as soon as the quarter is over. I've stopped reading the book and now just skim the topics to make sure I brush up on any weak areas using other sources."
1,"very superficial, not in depth enough","I found this book to give only a cursory overview to some very important topics. If you're very new to computer security, and for that matter computers and IT in general, this may be a useful book. Anyone who has even a basic knowledge of computer security will not find this book useful at all."
1,This does not sound like HArry James,I have the originals of Harry James this was my era and I would not recognize any of the recordings you list as his . Under no conditions would I buy this recording !
3,Great but uncomfortable,I am a sound design major student and the head phones are great for music and audio editing however they are uncomfortable and for people like me who will be wearing them for hours you may want to take comfort into consideration.
3,"Good as far as it goes, but...","This is an excellent reproduction of Delius' scores including the dedications and notes about the scores. It includes Brig Fair and On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring, but it does not include Appalachia, Paris, Florida Suite or other more minor works. So be aware!"
4,They should have half stars,"I would give this a 4 1/2. This cd is really good, the vocals are very intence. The guitars are very fast, and the drums are the fasteset thing ive ever herd. This cd is death metal with an influence of hardcore or metalcore. Defenitly buy this cd."
4,People are too judgemental,"People are too judgemental about this ablum and this band. I don't know where anyone gets that this is a nu-metal band or a metalcore band or that they have anything to do with all the latests cheese coming out like Atreyu, etc. This band is great. This CD is pretty good.One thing that I saw turning people off in the other comments was the vocals. People, don't take this stuff too seriously. It's not meant to be taken seriously. One comment said that the deep vocals sounded like a joke. Well, it most probably is. Sometimes when the deep vocals come in it makes me laugh, and it seems totally intentional.Musicianship = 10/10Songwriting = 8/10Production = 8/10Kickassness = 11/10Final message: If you like heavy metal and you don't take life too seriously, buy this album and blow your head off with it."
1,Awful Visual Quality,One of the many stunning qualities of this film is John Alton's mysterious photography--but you won't see anything near to what he created in this dreadful transfer from second- or third-generation source. It's not even black and white! More like some murky sepia. Wait till somebody responsible puts this out right.
4,Got it covered,This is a fine magazine with varied and interesting stories in every issue. A little America-centric and a tad heavy on the advertising. Difficult to find second hand as it is a great reference for professionals as well as inspiring for hobbists.
4,Cheesy but highly entertaining,"Bought this movie and showed it to high school Spanish classes. The students made fun of elements and compared the movie to the Spice Girls, but...they also seemed to enjoy it. The ""cheesy but highly entertaining"" comment came from a senior. Useful for exposing students to a different type of Spanish and to challenge some of their stereotypes about Latin America."
3,Entertaining...not great but not bad either.,There's hardly any surprises except at the end when they got noticed in a clever way.I think the movie would have been better without the silly chinese grocer because the movie could have cut it out and you wouldn't miss it.
2,Don't waste your money,"I thought this was my answer to my KP, but....it wasn't!it does make my skin a little smoother, but it's not enough to go, ooooh!Don't buy it, save your money."
3,a good read,"This is a good read. The characters are interesting and attractive, after you get past the initial problem of the hero being without empathy for the heroine and the dogs.However, there is a giant loose end that is not resolved. There's another mystery that's wrapped up in the last 2-3 pages, as though someone reminded the author, hey, you have to do something about that, and so there wasn't time for her to solve the other one. So you're left with a feeling of dissatisfaction and sorrow for one person."
2,Bad DVD transfer,"I first saw her PBS special on my flight to Japan. I got kind of mesmerized watching her on the small LCD display and listening to her with the headphone. I ended up watching it three times. I couldn't wait to get the DVD to see it on my home theater. Boy was I disappointed. I am not talking about her performance but the quality of the video transfer. It looks as though they filmed the concert off of somebody's TV. The picture is fuzzy and everytime they show her closeup, you can see the scan lines on her face.I have a progressive scan Toshiba DVD player with 55inch Mitsubishi HD ready TV. Watching most DVD movies on it is like watching the actual film, sharp without a hint of scan lines, but not this DVD. It's too bad her record company didn't put much care into making the DVD as the people who created the stage for her show."
3,Sarah Brightman One Night in Eden,"I saw a performance on public television and it was the first time I had seen or heard Sarah Brightman. Then I got this cd knowing it was not as recent as the performance I had just watched, but I hoped it would be close to the same since the cd isn't that old. Unfortunately it is quite a bit less creative than what I saw on PT. There is a killer performance she has done of Phantom of the Opera with a towering pipe organ and her standing on a platform at the top end of the pipes and the sound is...well it makes the hairs stand up on the back of your neck, it is that incredible. So I was somewhat disappointed. However her voice is wonderful no matter what and she is still very captivating. But I hope you will be able to acquire the cd that public broadcasting was promoting eventually."
5,Good but...,I first picked this one up a year ago and found it really useful. But then I got hold of Trading Online by Alpesh Patel. Trading Online gives you more punch for you dollar (or pound since I got it in London)
1,Dont' Buy,Total junk. 2nd time I went out on my boat one speaker clamp broke off and the speaker was hanging by a safety wire. I'm sure it has that wire because they are aware the the crappy plastic claps don't hold up going down the lake. 3rd time out the 2nd speaker broke off and hit one of my kids in the head. Went to return them today and Amazon wants me to pay the shipping and I only get a partial refund because it's been 31 days since I bought them.
4,Easy Mascara,"I really like this mascara. It is so easy to put on and remove - no clumping, no make-up remover, no raccoon eyes, no mascara stains on your towels, no flaking off of your eyelashes midday, just goes on and stays there! To remove it you just need warm water and then sort of rub it off with your fingers. It won't come off if you go swimming or anything like that. Since it forms tubes around your lashes it looks like your eyelashes are falling off when you remove it, but it's supposed to look like that so don't panic!My only qualm is that it doesn't do much in the thickening department. It seems to actually bunch my lashes together, so they look a bit thinner. For dramatic eyes I still use another mascara (Bare Escentuals Flawless Definition) but I use the Blinc whenever I am going casual or want to be able to easily remove my mascara."
2,It only failed me once...,"And that was enough to return it to the retailer. All I had all week was false alarms, and when this units had it's first real and perfect opportunity to shine...it failed miserably. And I'm not about to have any money tied up in something I can't trust to do the job I bought it to do. On a long approach, on a fairly busy freeway, I drove right past photo radar, parked on the shoulder. I mean, I came within 10 ft of his car...and not a peep out of my Whistler 1650...nothing. Oh, but next grocery store I pass after exiting the freeway, then it starts going crazy! I saw the radar camera's flash in my rear view mirror, so I know it was on and actively monitoring drivers. If I wanted a grocery store detector, I could have brought my wife for free..."
5,I Love This Movie!!!,"NOTE TO ALL REVIEWERS WHO TREAT THIS MOVIE LIKE IT WAS ANTI-CHRISTIAN: I don't want to sound like I'm anti-Christian myself (which I'm not), but doesn't EVERY movie have propaganda in it in one form or another? This movie says in the credits that it was based on the PLAY Inherit the Wind, not the Scopes Trial itself. And in the play itself, the authors write it not as pure history, but as a platform for in showing how refusing to accept (or at least respect) another's ideas, people can look like they're really narrow-minded. So back to my regular review: The acting is absolutely terrific! With the exception of some details pointed out by other reviews, I'd say that the acting is top-notch. The tension of the film keeps you glued to find out what happens. I love movies which really make you think!"
2,Inherit the wind - DVD,"While the movie is a classic and well worth purchasing to view over and over again. The quality of product itself has proven to be marginal with spotty pixelated sections, drop outs and occasional stops that require restarting. The first DVD package I received despite being completely sealed contained no disk at all, but Amazon quickly and gladly sent me another. This is the disk that has some problems. I don't know if it is a product problem like a bad disk or whether the problem is in the transfer. I suggest that if you purchase this that you view it immediately to assess the quality and return it to Amazon right away if there is any problem. Otherwise, there will continue to be problems with this type of product."
2,A memorable example of artistic license,"Have you ever watched a program in which - as would be announced prior to it being broadcast - ""only the names have been changed to protect the innocent""? Well, here almost everything has been changed - not only the names - and that not to protect the innocent but rather to delude them. When I first saw the film, I thought that it was an accurate protrayal of the Scopes Trial, and, being uniformed as I was, I continued to think that for many years afterwards.Is the film enjoyable? Yes, definitely; however, for the sake of honesty there should be a disclaimer at the start, declaring that it is a piece of fiction and that if one wants to know the truth about what happened at the Scopes Trial, they should not depend on this film for that.So I give the film 5 stars for entertainment value and 0 stars for truthfulness."
5,inherit the wind,"This movie brings to light the problem of religion versus science. Actors are on a class to themselves. They each developed a role to a level of excellence. At the end of the movie the problem was not solved but yet it makes you think. In the movie what the defense is fighting for the right to think differently even though some didn't agree with it. Again, it makes you think."
5,Works great USA,"I was worried about the fact this is a french release. As another reviewer said, this is no problem. I am half way through season four so I have had all but 3 disks in my blu-ray player with no issues. Special features are mostly in the form of featurette interviews with producers/writers and are not outstanding. Buy this for great picture and sound, but if you have a dvd copy, probably not worth the upgrade just for special features.I am enjoying watching through the series again!"
4,very good erotica; history buffs steer clear,"This book shows mr. Van Heller in classic form (no pun intended). Most of the scenes are very exiting, if you don't mind the odd incestuous scene, because we all know what those Borgias were like. As to the story, it is well written albeit historically a total mess (I bought this book in a set with two serious books about the Borgias). Great one-handed reading if you weren't planning on using the other hand for making notes for your thesis."
2,Ho Hum!,"Was expecting better. Per normal, Lee Remick was fine inthis role, the sets and the other roles............boring. Wouldseek a more modern version of this one before considering additional episodes."
4,Jennie: Lady Randolph Churchiill,I had read the book and this series brought it to life. I didn't want it to end. Very interesting history.
4,"""Authoritative and Concise""","The New Dictionary of Theology is an excellent resourse for the broad and timely expanse of theology. From Abelard to Zwingli, this edition covers with precision the vissicitudes of theological movements and of the erudite artificers who commenced with fervour such oblate campaigns. This Dictionary, however, is evangelicaly biased, but yet equally partial to the immense scope of Christian doctrine and thought. I have thoroughly enjoyed opening this Dictionary, and will continue to do so as it knowlegeably inhances my erudition towards theology. This book has been a blessing on my shelf, and it would be wise to purchase such a masterwork for yourself."
5,Help when help is needed,"When I ordered this book I was not sure as to what to expect, but it turned out to be an excellent guide to Beetle restoration especially for those who are not too experienced.I would recommend it to anyone"
2,poor design,"My 3-year-old loves his potty. But if he's not sitting exactly right, and he's usually not, then the pee goes everywhere. The removable bucket that is supposed to catch the pee only catches about half of it, the rest is on his pants, and mostly inside the potty under and around the bucket - which is a pain to clean up, and it's just a really stupid design flaw."
4,good book with a completely different approach towards pll,"This book will give you a good understanding of PLL theory and design with a entire different approach. Author did not use the traditional control theory approach and took a dirrerent root. A good number of practical examples and some new development of phase detectors are covered here. However, the author did not mentioned about charge pump PLL. Author approach may not prepair the readers for reading the current literature since they are based on control theory."
4,Unusual,It's not exactly pop and it's not really rock. They don't have th annoying sound of Brittany and co. but they don't have the ice cruelty of Shirley Manson. Either love them or hate them them. Pop rock
5,BEST GAME,The World Is Not Enough is good multiplayer and mission. And Also I finished all level mission for agent only I going to win all level mission for secret agent and 00 agent. It was good challenge mission and had cool weapon and gadgets. I give 5 stars for good game.I recommend they should buy that games.
4,This game is great!,"This great game is much better than its preceder, Goldeney.There are many levels ranging from the heart of London to the Middle East.each level is richly detailed and immerses you in a 3D arena.The game is based on the recent movie: The World is not enough 007.There are more than 400 recorded text lines.Of course,James Bond will be using some cool gadgets, starting with his modified BMW Z8 car, his key copier and the sleek Q boat."
2,Not Surperior to Goldeneye On Gameplay,"Graphic Wise This Game Is Better Than Goldeneye, But When It Comes To Gameplay This Game Falls Short. I Thought It Was Cool That The Characters Now Speak, But Still Their Mouths Don't Move. The Biggest Loss Is That There Are No More Explosives Or Cool Guns. Where Are The RCP-90's and Remote Mines? If You're Like Me and Love to Fill Your Enemies With Hot Lead Or Blow Things Up You Probobly Won't Enjoy This Game As Much as Goldeneye. Finally There's The Multiplayer, Wich Is Good But Very Cheesy."
4,Coolest Bond Game,"The World is Not Enough is one of the coolest shooters (other than Perfect Dark) that I played. Since that the game engine is improved, you can use secondary functions on your weapons. (Example: You could decide if you want your standard pistol to be silenced or not or have your machine gun be automatic or burst fire) Another improvement is that the graphics, and the realism of the game. What is the realism of the game? Reloading is realistic, hostage rescue missions and less civilian casualties put more pressure, and there is one level where you have to use stealth (not your weapons) to complete the mission. Minus one star for multiplayer. Since that there is computer players, there should be an intelligence setting where you should decide if you want the AI to be smart or dumb. It exists on single-player missions but not on multiplayer.The World is Not Enough is a cool game. Hope Electronic Arts releases another Bond game when Bond 20 hits the theaters!"
4,gamer,"i thought this game was ackward and boring at first. I played a few missions and found it to become funner as you progressed. It is not at all like Goldeneye. It does however have its own special things I liked. The characters talk instead of you just reading which is a nice bonus. The graphics are great and the game follows the movie better. I did however find it a little easy. I've had it for two days, played about six hours on it and have beaten half the missions. I like it though. The multiplayer though is not very good. The Al bots are a nice bonus but very easy to kill. It is very easy to kill people in multiplayer so games are less interesting. I would recommend this to anyone who is in it for the single player. It is overall a good game."
5,SO cool,This game is so cool. If you dont want to play i player you can just do multi player and fight al bots. If you have goldeneye you should definetly upgrade it to this game SOON!!!!!!!
3,The Game is ok.,"What can I say. I rented the game. A waste of money. They tryed to make the game like Goldeneye but they failed. The graphics were bad for games that require the expansion pak. I mean play Perfect Dark then play this. These griphics are bad. The game story followed the movie, but only to the basic story line. As most games that are based on movies do, they added and took away parts that were in the movie. The cut scenes (if you could call it that) were really bad. In the boat chase in the begining there were no waves on the water (this was one of many problems). The music was anouying it. It played a part of the TWINE theme song over and over. The AI seemed like no one even programed it. Oh and the multyplay was the worst of all. I tryed to play the human VS. bot mode alone, thinking it would be like Perfect Dark and well it wasn't. Over all...I wouldn't bye this game. Two thumbs down. If you have the Playstation or the PS2 I would say get it on there."
2,EA should be ashamed,"When I first turned the game on, I was impressed. After playing it for a few days, though, I got the impression that I would be trading it in shortly. No Blood??? The auto-aim on the game really comes up short, The multiplayer is embarrassing. And Load time???? When did N64 turn into a playstation? What really turns me off is the fact that after you fail a mission, it stops it. I don't know about the rest of you, but I enjoyed wiping out innocent civilians. I am really disappointed about this game. After playing an inferior game like this, I had to turn on Perfect Dark to remember what a real first-person shooter was all about. Don't waste your money on this game, I'll sell ya mine!"
3,Not as perfect as Golden Eye,"You thought I was only going to review just 1 Bond video game NO! Well RARE unfortunately didn't have the 007 licence in 99 or 2000 EA had it & there Bond games were pretty forgettable there good but nothing special thank God Activision has a hold on the licence now. TWINE is a good game but not excellent like Golden Eye. But you should all give it a shot it's based on the 1999 movie with Pierce Brosnan basically it does stick closely to the movie as it can maybe too close I have to say levels 10, 12 & 13 are from h**l. The ending is mediocre but the movie it's self is better than this game."
5,Jane Eyre,"This is the best of all the renditions of this story. The characters are developed so well by the actors and actresses, and the story is brought to life in all its tragedies and triumphs. Black and white always seems to blend best with these stories and allows the viewer to see the story rather than being dazzled by the brilliant color. This Jane Eyre is worth having as part of a DVD library."
4,Very Nice Film,"A classic, lovely interpretation of the classic story. While more recent versions are perhaps more detailed, this older movie is still very worthy and entertaining. In particular there is a fine performance by young Peggy Ann Garner (as young Jane)."
2,Funny predictible uber-horror,"When I rented this film I really didn't expect much out of it, but surprise surprise, it didn't suck as much as I thought it would. Now I'm as big a fan of Pat Morita as the next guy, but his preformance as the only ""big name"" talent is really disapointing. He has a showdown with the snake. A THIRTY FOOT SNAKE!! vs. PAT MORITA. DOES THAT SEEM TO MAKE SENSE!!!?? But hey what do you expect. The film's acting was tolerable, some of the effects were ok, but for the most part a big rubbery looking snake with an awckwardly positioned neck, and the token *SHOCK* shots used to make the film ""scarrier"" make you jump a bit, but oly in releif that you don't have to b on the lookout. The ending was also a huge dissapointment. You never find ut what happens to some of the characters and it practicaly screams at you, ""LOOK OUT FOR KING COBRA 2"" ut what do you expect from straight to video horror. ^.^"
2,instead,"I reccommend Komodo instead. I prefer shark movies, but I liked Komodo better than all the croc,gator,snake movies i've seen."
2,Out of date and petty-- There are so many better arguements to be made!,"This book makes a few good points-- it isn't a good idea to limit children's learning to digital means and most computer equipment used by children is designed for adults which can be difficult at best.However, the author provides the most petty evidence for these claims. Yes, carpal tunnel is a danger, but not for the school children in the book who use share a few computers for a few hours per week. More dangerous is the way neural pathways are formed to accommodate digital media rather than concrete items.This book is also out of date as far as the Information Age progresses. It doesn't take into account that many children have a unsupervised computer access, etc.Not worth the money."
1,This wasn't for me,"When purchasing recodings made by Greek artists, I've always felt that I couldn't go wrong by purchasing anything produced by Dalaras. This CD proved me wrong. While I concede that there are many Dalaras fans out there who will love this CD, those looking for a recording in line with Dalaras' past work will be disappointed. This is a definate departure from anything Dalaras has done in the past. If you are looking for a rembetiko, or laiko tragoudi, look elsewhere, you won't find it on this CD. I've tried giving this CD away, but everyone keeps giving it back."
5,Best movie ever made and I have seen most of them,"Contact was so powerful that I frequently found myself shaking during the movie. Never before did I experience something that came close to it in a movie. All the appropriate comments have already been made about the movie and I won't repeat them here but the simple fact of reading those comments made me re-live many of the great moments of the movie. I am completely at a loss to understand the people that did not like it. Some of the poor reviews were from religious fanatics and those we can easily forgive. Some reviews, however, seemed to come from ""normal"" people and I can only guess that they must be very young ones, not yet able to fully appreciate the capabilities and the joy that a fully working mind provides."
1,Contact,Contact must be the worst movie ever made. I couldn't have finished it if not for the beautiful Jodie Foster. It's about listening for contacts from outer space. Foster's efforts are financed by an impossibly weathy person who must have been cracked. Billions of dollars are wasted on an impossible scheme. I thought I would throw up.
4,"Great Ending, Slooooooooow Beginning","The ending to this was great, the whole idea that science and religion are driven towards the same goal using different means to achieve the same end, good stuff.HOWEVER, holy s*** the first and second acts are slow. Do we really need to see the Giant A-hole walking around sucking up credit for everything? Did we really need to see Gary Busey's son as a psycho cult leader and the whole destruction of the first device when a second one was readily avaliable? It felt like pointless filler padding out a strong story into an overly long drag, if I was in charge of editing Contact I'd probably take out about an hour of filler.Anyways underneath all the forced drama lies a really good story that sci-fi fans and religious people can both enjoy."
4,contact,i liked it just as much as i did the first time i saw it and was good with special effects for when it was made
4,Movie Review,"This movie was okay. Was not exactly what I expected, but was not bad at all. Would probably watch it again."
4,A must see for the extra-T believer,Very good story line. Keeps you rooting for the one who believes. Would have liked to see the movie end with more validation. Keeps you on th edge of the seat!
1,Maybe you like that sort of thing but I was offended.,"I do believe that this film had some measure of intellectual stimulation. I also think that that quality was compromised by the immaturity of the characters. As intelligent people we should not lay blame on others for a short-coming. Contact seems to do just that. An example would be the involved religious question in the movie.This event makes the world religions look selfish and corrupt.There are other examples but you should decide for yourself. I will leave you with this; I love movies, in fact there are only two films which I did not completely enjoy. ""Natural Born killers"" was the other one. I do hope you will enjoy the show because I cannot."
4,Fun sci-fi written by scientist!,Wonderful combination of advanced astronomy based on writings of the late respected and admired Carl Sagan. Outstanding cast and acting enhanced by imaginative cameo by President Bill Clinton. Impossible to overlook futuristic cinematography skillfully integratedwith this jaw-dropping and entertaining Completely believable partial bio-pic creates a fun and entertaining film experience with longevity.
5,Thoroughly Believable,"Supposing we did make contact. All of the things we would have to deal with are beautifully weaved into the script. The machine is what I would call ""true to life"" if we were actually given the technology by a more advanced race. I'm convinced that folding or warping space-time is the way to travel to other worlds and demands an achievable amount of energy that we will soon be able to make. If we live long enough, this beautifully-made movie will become real life."
5,Best Movie Ever!,"Contact has something for everyone. Adventure, technology, romance, family, political strife, religion and of course Jodi Foster who has been a solid actress since she was young! The streaming quality of this was excellent and I enjoyed it as much as when was I a teenager.This should be one of your first rentals on Amazon!"
1,Don't waste your time,This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a really long build-up to a very disappointing ending. Save yourself time that you'll never get back and don't bother with this one.
5,SMALL bowl review,"This is a well-made product, just be aware that it is really small. The inside dimentions of the bowl are about 3.5 x 2.5 inches. It will hold one and only one baby box turtle at a time. On the other hand the small size can be an advantage with hatchlings -- my hatchling Ornate box turtle has no problem crawling in and out of this bowl. My guess is it would be great for other small critters like hermit crabs."
4,Good water bowl,this bowl works great the tortoises have easy access for the water bowl it would be better if it was a couple inches bigger but otherwise works great for one at a time
3,This movie is still a lot of fun!,"I used to watch this movie on late night shows, with my parents in the early eighties. Shows like, ""Friday Fright Night"" and ""Creature Feature with Crematia Mortem"". That type of thing. I was kind of amazed to see this available on dvd! So, I ordered a copy. It had been probably twenty years since I'd seen it... I worried that I may not like it much now, or that the quality of the dvd would be that of a degenerated vhs copy transferred to dvd... Alas, I was wrong on both accounts! The movie is still a lot of fun to watch, for me anyway. And it has been properly cleaned up for dvd release!! Great stuff!! If you were a fan of late night, b-horror/sci-fi shows back in the seventies/eighties. Or you just enjoy absurd type movies. Then, check ""Laserblast"" out!!! That's really all I can say about it. Enjoy!!!Laserblast"
5,HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!,"I pretty much agree with ALL the reviewers here. This is a bad cheesy movie which I enjoyed for some strange reason. It's hard to describe, but this movie makes cheesy film-making an art form. It probably is for nostalgics only, but who knows. I saw it once when I was very young and it stuck in my mind until I accidentally stumbled across it on amazon.com 24 years later. As soon as I saw it listed here, I just HAD to get it, and I wasn't disappointed. It is what it is, and I like it for that."
2,Dissapointment,I was so looking forward to this game being a big fan of Def Jam Vendetta and Fight for NY but was so dissapointed to see this game was no where near what I expected. Why couldn't they had just mad Fight for NY but with better graphics? This game is just garbage all the way round from the slow game play to the limited controls. Complete dissapointment.
2,Repetition,"This game is very repetitive. If you like doing virtually the same thing repeatedly while changing clothes on rare occasion, this is the game for you. Talk to your boss, go fight, talk to your boss, go fight, ... ZZzzzzzzzzzzzz"
3,Not Nearly as Good Def Jam Vendetta,"I was really looking forward to this game, breaking my normal habits of only buying used games. I loved Def Jam Vendetta, and I thought the new feature of utilizing music, including MP3s from my collection would put a great twist on the game mechanics. Sadly, the best parts of the previous game were lost - there is no training, the fighting styles can't be mixed and the game was somehow both short, and far too repetitive.The concept of becoming a producer could have been interesting, but wasn't. And the overarching story was rather predictable, and at times a bit too far from reality, even for a fighting game."
5,the coolest bond game,"i think this is the coolest bond game because you get to ski, drive, and gamble. the other cool thing about it has clips from the movie that ties all the levels together. although i wish it was at least two players, i still gave it 5 stars not only because it is fun, but because i like bond games."
4,"Great, but coulda been betta","This game has excellent graphics, character models, and level layout. But the things that disappointed me the most were the limited number of animations for the enemies (in their death throes, they look extremely jerky), the shaky enemy AI (sometimes they were hard to defeat, other times they would simply stand there and take bullets) and the lack of a multiplayer mode. The inclusion of a multiplayer deathmatch mode like in Goldeneye007 or Medal of Honor would have given this game 5 stars instead of 4."
5,It's a MUST to read for all parents and educators!,Absolutely loved the book! To the point; right on!
1,Eighteen Visions of CRAP in a bucket.,"These guys are an utter joke. Fashion over substance and talent is all I have to say. ""Fashion-core"" losers like them are giving metalcore and the Orange County scene a bad name. This isn't even metal or hardcore at all. They opened for Killswitch Engage when I saw them and I wanted to shove screwdrivers into my eardrums to make the hurting stop. ""Obsession...Depression.."" OVER AN OVER in this annoying whiny voice. ""Are you running away from meeeeee?"" in an even more annoying voice. The singing is HORRID. I cannot believe people like this pile of cow manure.This is not music. This is what terrorists use to torture victims and coerce information out of them. Avoid at all costs."
1,this cd is not good,"if you need a laugh, check out hte DVD portion of thi album. They show James singing in the studio and lets say its a really bad american idol audition. plus, they copy and paste their parts rather than recording the song together. James can't sing a whole song for nothing so he has to sing each part of hte song instead of the whole thing.this band's new album is pretty bad too. The songs rip off STP and fails to hit great catchy songs which GNR, STP, and Def Leppard did best.I'll give this CD credit though, its way better than Brenadan Schiapetti's terrible Bleeding through CD. The bleeding through album is too boring and repettive... at lesat you can sing along to the songs."
5,this is the best cd sike!!,warning warning warning warning to all hardcore fans stay away from this cd its bad news do not wast the money. if it wasent for him leven the band eighteen visions would stay metal.warning do not buy this cd.Obsession
1,holy wtf!?,"this cd.. is horrible. if you want to go hear eighteen visions, go pick up greatest hits, or until the ink runs out. back when they were actually a hardcore band. now they just play pathetic pop rock music. makes me want to cry. it's the biggest step down ever taken."
3,Your influences are showing... but still a decent record,"I've seen and heard 18V in basically every stage of their ""storied"" OC hardcore/straight-edge (hardline brah... or is it nardline?) career and can definately say that, although this *is* a departure (as the other reviewers have said) from their ""pickin' weeds"", corona showcase pit mosh, and snapple ""straight edge beer"" metal jams of the past, it still is a solid stand-alone effort.Their STP (admitted) influence definately shows here, and it also sounds like Tim from VOD rubbed off on James' vocal stylings as well...I could get into most of this album, except for track 6, which just straight up sounds like Incubus... sorry.The best part of this band is Eric ""Worst Guy"" Johnson, however. He rules. This is definately the soundtrack to cruise a Newps Del sesh with, or maybe even go nostalgic and get a Loco tofu/mushroom burger, or cruise D-land with Monster Crew!LSC will meet you there."
3,Snuh.,"This CD sounds nothing like earlier 18Visions' work. If you're expecting another 'Vanity' you will probably be disappointed. However, this is an ok rock record. Not bad but not like anything 18 Visions has ever done. If you're looking for something new to listen to, along the lines of the current rock scene, this would be it. My current favorite songs on this CD are This Time and Lost in a Dream. If you want something heavier than this, try the latest Avenged Sevenfold or Scars of Tommorrow releases."
1,A Green-Left academic's warped view of of the Climate Debate,"Dr Beder takes the corporations of the world to task for trying to defend themselves against the global warming juggernaut. While in some cases this is justified, the book reveals more about Dr Beder's own ideological blind spots than about the nature of the debate.While maligning corporations, Beder ignores the machinations of groups such as Greenpeace, the Pew Charitable trust and other large, wealthy organisations efforts to hype global warming. Thus, the reader is left with the false impression that the pressure is all in one (the corporate) direction.Greenies will love this book, because it will stroke their prejudices while not revealing what they don't want to hear (ie, the truth about efforts of Greenpeace, etc, to surrepticiously influence the debate)."
4,"Easy install, good product (don't trust the picture)","Pros-Easy to install w/ 2 people-Looks much better than the picture (look it up elsewhere, you'll see)-Fast install (apprx 20 min)-Cheaper than U-Haul option-Loosening muffler mounts not really nec if you are really carefulCons-Heavy, much easier w/ 2 people-Powder coat is easily chipped-Full size spare might not fit with hitch installed. Looks close.-Amazon has the wrong picture attached to this productAsk a friend to help with the installation, this is a difficult one-person task. Very little expertise required, though. I recommend DL'ing the instructions before you purchase to see what it really looks like. They are available, just google the model number."
4,Good toy for the $$$$,"My baby has played with this toy every day for six months straight, and she is 18 months old now and still playing with it. That speaks for itself I think. Someone else complained about a baby getting the shapes stuck in their mouth, which is a scary thought but I have not had that problem. I definitely think it is worth buying for any baby."
2,Would have been great.....,"I bouhght this for my daughter at 6 1/2 months. She loved sounds and light. Thought this toy would be a hit. Would have been great however it broke shortly after I gave it to her. She is now 1 1/2. I haven't the heart to throw it away because It's like brand new. The sounds just don't work. They just repeat themselves and it sounds like a irratating skipped record. However, I leave the sound off and she is still entertained by the birds on top and taking the shapes out and putting them back in. Also I use the shapes as play dough cutters. Not all lost.... Just beware in buying one."
4,"8 month old daughter enjoys... music gets old, though!","My 8 month old daughter enjoys playing with this toy; she will play with it for ~ 10 minutes at a time. The big ""bird bath"" area is great for little hands to press at this age when fine and gross motor skills are evolving. The toy seems durable. My biggest complaint is the same song that plays *every* time she presses the ""bird bath"". It can get a bit old."
3,ok its a good start,its a good start after you buy a psp not much memory for music but good when you have a few games great with wallpapers/pictureswhen you save stuff memory goes as fast as your money when you buy psp games exc well heres what i rate it0 out of 5 5 being the bestwallpaper/pictures 4 out of 5music 1 out of 5 holds about 9 songs with nothing else on itgames 3 out of 5well buy if you can find it cheep if not dont waste your moneyits a rip off at stores its about $30.00 but most people already have it any way it comes with value pack
4,seems NOT like old times.,"I didnt know the freshmen were STILL going. Obviously there has been a change in the lineup (i'd love to know who )and , because they used to be the ultimate vocal group in the 60's, they arent as good as then. Nevertheless, they still knock spots off the socalled groups of today."
5,excellent singing and orchestra,"Wonderful CD. . .enjoy. Singers sound exactly like the original group. However, one big hit is missing. . .""It's a Blue Moon."" That was a huge hit. Otherwise it's terrific."
2,Cute...,"I was disappointed in this book. It was the small cute version of the bigger one I was hoping to get. The front cover ""I spy"" photo wasn't even in the book. It would be fantastic for a small child's diaper bag. It is a series of blown up photos from other books for simpler ""spying""."
5,The King of Pop,Love this quirky short film it is what MJ did best and he is a great loss to the world
3,TROUBLE VIEWING,FOR SOME REASON THIS VCD DOES NOT PLAY WELL ON MY DVD PLAYER.IF IT PLAYS AT ALL IT IS A SHADOW PICTURE OR IT JUST DOES NOT PLAY AT ALL.VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS DVD.
5,Cute Toy!,"I was very skeptical about ordering this popper, but I was pleasantly surprised when I received it. I find the handle to not be flimsy at all, if fact my son is pretty rough with his toys and this toy takes it! It is a very cute theme, and my son really enjoys it. I would however recommend it for the younger child- ages 12 months to 3 years, it is kind of small for a five year old."
3,John Deere - Pop N' Go Combine,"The boys liked this toy, but the balls in the popper didn't really ""pop"" very much. I've seen cheaper poppers that popped a LOT more."
2,"The rooms look too ""studied"" and too ""new""","Reviewers have been giving this book a hard time so I thought I should weigh in with my opinion. The rooms in the book don't look that bad, but they do look too ""studied"" and too ""new,"" and that is what gives them the phony, showy, nouveau-riche look. I got the feeling that each room was almost created from scratch as if the people living in the rooms didn't start out with one decent heirloom or personal object. The author seems to have found rooms that generally show good use of square footage, so you can get some ideas from them. (I wasted money on this book so I am trying to make the best of it and glean what ideas I can from it.)"
1,disappointing in every way,"Magazine images of Bilhuber's designs have always taken my breath away, so when I saw this book, I quickly jumped at the chance to buy it. What a mistake! Not only are the images fuzzy, the text is almost useless. Bilhuber never gives the reader any useful suggestions or tips as to why he picked any particular item for each room. He doesn't help the reader ""see"" the thinking beyond the room and there were no design principles or bits of advice I could come away with. I feel cheated because I wanted the book to do what it promised and offer ""expert solutions for designing the house of your dreams."" Extremely disappointing and a waste of money."
1,Showhouses not real homes,"I'm one of the people who bought this book and were sorry. It's filled with what look like showhouses and not real homes. One reviewer on amazon tried to justify the book's nouveau riche content by saying that, ""While the images provided reflect the lifestyle of many his clients, it's easy to translate his teachings into any lifestyle or budget."" If that is the case, then why didn't the author include homes that reflected a variety of lifestyles and budgets in the first place? Of course, there's still no accounting for taste......."
2,A Great Effort Sadly Lacking,"I held great hopes for this book--Duveen has long been of interest to me because of the pivotal role he played in the creation of some of the greatest art collections in this country. However, Secrest in her drive to capture the ""essence"" of the man has so mangled the story of his life and career that reading her work is more chore than delight. To say the book is disorganized is to deal in serious understatement. But worse than that are the inaccuracies, especially when she writes about Duveen's customers. Just for starters, apparently she didn't recognize the need to differentiate between John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and his father (or maybe she didn't know there has been more than one JDR!). You won't learn much from this tome that you don't know to begin, and getting through it will be a struggle."
4,I like it,"Have always been a fan of K&N; air filters. Have them in all if my vehicles - bikes, cars, rv.Be careful though, over zealous with the cleaning and re oiling can cause your MAF to go prematurely."
5,Nationalism,"The main themes here, as in Tigana and Song for Arbonne, are nationalism, patriotism, what makes a country what it is. In Tigana, Kay wrote about fighting to keep (or restore) what made a country what it was. Here, he focuses more on good aspects of a nation, but how some things can be let go, and the people still belong. It's a difficult concept for a modern American to really appreciate, with no other countries in the world really rivalling ours. A unique book, and a great break from sword and sorcery fantasy."
5,One of the best I've read this year!,"I have never written a review but I am surprised this book is not getting more attention. I read quite a few books every week and this one was exceptional. The majority of the book takes place in the Artic, a place where most of us will never visit and it has a wealth of information on the Inuit culture and history, past and present. Its story deals with universal themes of loss, adaptation to change, loneliness and isolation, and families struggling at all stages of their lives. Like life, this book takes you through every emotion. It also includes the lives of those who are not Inuit."
2,not so much,"I have the entire set of Anna Leigh's , ""The Mackenzies"" and wanted to add this to the collection, since one of the stories is written by Leigh. Compared to the other ones this one's a dud. Sorry"
2,SHANACHIE RECORDS LABEL PROBLEM,"I'VE NOTICED THEY ONLY HAVE 10 SONGS ON MOST OF THE RELESED CDs.THIS IS ANNOYING AND STINKS FROM THIS RECORD LABEL, THEY NEED TO INCLUDE MORE TRACKS ON THEIR CDs .THIS CD IS LISTENABLE, BEST TRACKS ARE LOWDOWN AND PILLOW TALK, THERE IS A LOT OF SYNTHESIZED MUSIC IN THE BACKROUND OF OTHER TRACKS,MAKING IT SOUND LIKE KAROKE. THE SAME IS ALSO NOTED ON THE NEW GLEN JONES CD."
1,Broke in 6 months...,"After purchasing this product, my wife and I were very happy with it. However, after six months, the DVD player no longer recognized DVD's or audio CD's. We were upset to find that the warranty had expired, and that the estimates to fix the thing were almost as much as buying a new player. I like Sony products and this is the first lemon I've purchased from them. I went back and purchased another Sony DVD player, only this time I opted to spend less and went with the single disk. Quite the bummer!"
1,Broke after six months,"Like one other reviewer, mine stopped recognizing DVD's after six months. Unlike hime I have not had good luck with Sony lately. My DVD player, VCR, and Playstation 2(all sony products) stopped working within 4 months of each other. It costs almost as much to repair them as replace them, so I'm replacing them with a different brand."
5,Holl's thoughts run deep!,"I first heard about Adolf Holl in the mid-70s when the controversy around his teachings spread through the Austrian media like wildfire. Occasionally, Holl was a talk-show host and guest on various Austrian programs where he communicated his deep-running thoughts. This book is certainly an interesting read as Holl researches and analyses the subject intensely. To judge if his conclusions are correct is up to the reader--some may agree and find it even inspirational, others may brush off this and that. Anyway, it sure provides plenty of ammunition for many brain-storming hours of debate, discussion and thought. Another book that I highly recommend, which was also written by an Austrian-born writer, who's become known as the theological whiz kid of our time, is a very helpful book by Dietmar Scherf ""I Love Me: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression"" -- also available at Amazon."
5,Over the Face of the Waters,"Holl's brilliantly written masterpiece surveys the history of those who were convinced they were inspired directly by God, only to clash with established religion. Holl looks at Gnostics, Cathars, renegade militant Anabaptists, and Pentecostals, all with superbly readable wit and touches of dry humor. This book is a golden example of theology that is fun bedtime reading as well. Interested in getting in touch with the heretics of history? There's no better selected guide."
5,cover up,"less than 20, really what i thought, plain cover, what i expected, covereed up a hack job install by the previous owner."
3,DONT BE FOOLED,"FIRST OFF THIS IS NOT A DVD.THERE IS NO VISUAL FOOTAGE UNLESS YOU LIKE READING LYRICS.THE MUSIC IS GREAT,THE SONGS ARE GREAT,THE RECORDING IS GREAT.BUT THE TERM DVD IS MISLEADING & SHOULD NOT EVEN BE ON THE LABEL. GT2PLUS2"
1,disconnected and a chore to read.,"Was this book about Italy? I couldn't tell. After forcing myself to read the first half, I finally disposed of it. The author gives little, if any insight to what it is like living in Italy, and seems more interested in showing off her prose."
5,"Alec Guinness, British Comedic Icon","If you enjoy British Comedy at its best, Alec Guinness will give you perfection! Mr. Guinness is an absolute wonder."
5,Alec Guinness,Wacthed all these movies when I was a kid. Great to see them again. It arrrived here right on time.
5,"Alec Guinness, greatest actor","Alec Guinness had a gift that most actors would love: to so fit a chosen role that there is complete transparency between the actor and the figure he or she is portraying. As much as I admire Katherine Heburn, Humphrey Bogart, and other great actors of the last century, they were almost always playing screen versions of themselves. I can think of only one other actor who may be able to mirror Guinness's ability right now, Carey Mulligan, who, of course, has many years and roles to fill before she can compare with Guinness.These (mostly) Ealing Studio comedies offer ample proof of Guinness's ability to disappear into the roles he is playing. When my own daughter went to drama school, I advised her that she could save money by simply watching and carefully studying Alec Guinness films.Buy this collection. You won't be disappointed."
4,"Peasant Hat, Very Creative","This chinese straw hat I ordered was beautiful. Very skilled craftmanship. Although it is huge, its an awesome hat to shield against the burning sun and heat. When wored, I felt like a peasant working in the rice fields, but don't let that get in the way! :D I bought two, one for me and for my grandpa. He needed a hat like this since he always spent his time in the yard during the blazing heat. It helped alot. I love this hat, I feel like Pang Tong from DW!! :)"
4,a challenging puzzle game that focuses on folding socks,"A game that focuses on Pajama Sam folding his socks may seem strange and boring, but in this game it is a fast-paced puzzle that requires good reflexes and skill in following paths.The object of the game is to move socks into their correct color-coordinated bins by way of various conveyor belts and shoots. Players will also need to utilize a lever which switches the speed the socks travel, and occasionally paint buckets to change the socks' colors.The beginning levels are generally easy, but later levels can involved multiple socks all bouncing around on conveyor belts at different speeds, and getting different colored socks in their correct bins can be very tricky. There is also a feature that allows player to make custom-made levelsIf you are looking for a different type of arcade for a child, or perhaps someone older, that likes puzzles that involve strategy and quick clicking then I recommend this game to you."
3,definitely not ultimate,"I agree with another reviewer that this DVD is for advanced beginners. The combos are boring and not very unusual. I expected better from these well-known dancers, maybe a few signature moves to spice up the dance. Volume 2 is just in the same style, it is not more advanced.The dance at the end of the DVD is the best part.I also think that iamed videos are usually overpriced."
4,Very Good DVD,"This young lady does a very good job on this DVD and if you like her style, I would suggest that you also but it."
5,Dream with Me - Jackie Evancho DVD,"I bought this for my husband and some friends, some for Christmas. Everyone we know loves Jackie, especially my husband and me."
5,Jackie is amazing,"I'm really glad to have stumbled across Jackie Evancho on youtube. Jackie's voice is mesmerizing. One can't help but be impressed with not only her marvelous voice, but also with her innocence and sweet personality.This performance is simply outstanding and the DVD is produced in a top-notch way. The only downside is that it is not a little longer for the price, but it is still great.Jackie's voice and music are a fantastic pick-me-up for your spirit."
5,gift for mother,I bought this video as a gift to my mother who lives in PR. They mailed as indicated with no delays. She told me that she have been playing it every day.
5,WHAT CAN YOU SAY,"I mean, what can you say about Jackie Evancho, that has not already been said? What this child has, goes way past, just a good sound. When she sings, it stirs something inside me. As one of the judges said on the show, AGT, she did not understand a word that Jackie was singing, but the sound of her voice was Heavenly. The sound she makes, when she sings, is beyond description. It causes feelings inside me that no other singer has in my life, and I am 63 years old and have herd all the great singers in my lifetime. I have bought all of her recordings, and will buy any others she ever makes. Others have noted, that when she sings, she stops being this young child, and seems to be way beyond her years. She herself has said, that she almost feels possessed when she sings."
5,It caught me by surprise...,"There is not a weak song on the album. What it communicates is heartfelt, pure, beautiful and varied in style. It isn't overproduced, but lets the emotion come through clearly. What a great debut!"
5,Among Sassy's best,"This is a largely unknown gem in Sarah Vaughan's discography. A group of trio performances recorded in 1961 for radio broadcast, the songs on this disk feature to-the-point, swinging renditions of standards such ""I Cried for You,"" ""Over the Rainbow,"" ""Tenderly,"" ""Summertime"" and ""Poor Butterfly."" In fact, the disk gets through the 16 tunes in 43 minutes, but it leaves you wanting to hear more -- the best possible compliment. Sarah's voice is light and well projected. The presence of Roland Hanna on piano is a bonus.In short, this disk ranks with her best studio work of the time with Count Basie and the minimalist ""After Hours"" LP. Highly recommended, especially given the bargain price."
1,Cannot understand a word he is saying....,"This DVD had the potential to be great... however, I simply could not understand a word the narrator was saying. OK, I may have understood the odd word, but trying to comprehend any sentence was next to impossible. Perhaps his accent was used to give some special feel to the DVD. The problem though, was that his accent was just too thick."
2,No New News,"I was disappointed by this book. It held very little new information that I haven't already read in other books. I ordered it, looked through it reading a few pages in each chapter and then decided to return it. It's possible that there are redeeming factors but if so, I didn't happen to read those parts."
2,Good Budget Buy???,"The First Movie Nosferatu is considered a classic German silent movie. However,this Americanized version changes the original title cards to the names used in Dracula. (Which this movie was based on.) This I could deal with for the price. The bigger problem is the writing runs right off the screen at times so you have to guess at what is being said.The next movie is in black & white. It is a low budget vampire movie from the forties. The movie centers around a doctor and his evil twin brother. The story was fairly entertaining and looked fine to me. I found this to be the best of the three movies.The final movie Chain of Souls is newer and is in color. The basic concept is Kyla goes to Hollywood looking to become an Actress. At an audition she discovers something sinister. Although that sounds like it could be good, it's really not. I was bored by this movie.So is this a good budget buy? As is, probably not. If they fixed the title cards to Nosferatu it would be."
3,"Put the Thomas logo on it, double the price.","We bought this at the Thomas visiting train event for $6.95. I like the colorforms over regular stickers, as they are much more durable in the hands of my 2yo. My 3yo is thrilled that so many trains were included in the set. However, for the 1-inch thick box, all you get for sticking these on is the picture on the cover. Once all the tracks were occupied, my son started started sending the trains to the Great Scrap Heap In The Sky. Either that, or they sprouted invisible wings.For this to be a truly good product, the background should have been 1) oriented the other way, and 2) should have had at least three other backgrounds - the docks, Tidmouth Sheds, or some other locations.Once again, I am disappointed by the Thomas merchandising machine."
3,You Must Really Love Thomas To Buy This Toy!,"I love that they came up with a Colorform set for this. I am disappointed, however, by how expensive it is for what you get. This set costs almost $10 after shipping. I found one at our pharmacy for $3.50 a week later! The stickers don't stick well and you can't get them to stay on the ""storage sheet"". The background for the stickers to go on is too small and done ""portrait style"", when it should be ""landscape"". This toy is still played with and enjoyed, but I wish I had paid a lot less for it."
5,Interesting,"This is a worthwhile book. The history is well reserched, the photos are good, and the writing is smooth. Good deal. I loved the pictures. The book makes me want to visit Ocean City. It's sequel, Ocean City Vol. II, is equally good."
4,More Needed,Ms. Morgan has written two Cat Man series that I read and thoroughly enjoyed. She has come up with a new slant to romance novels. Her creativity is great and the story lines are not the same 'ol same 'ol. I read about 2-5 books a week and Ms. Morgan's certainly stands out as one of the best. Ms. Morgan's Cat Men and Ms. Feehan's Carpathians are my favorite. Ms. Morgan reaches a good balance between romance and sexual inuendo. I have been looking for more than a year for her to write additional stories in this genre. Please write more!
3,Spa cart,No instructions were sent with item to put it together. Cart not worth 60$. Could have found one more sturdy cheaper..
5,True Loretta,This is a true example of Lretta Lynn's singing quality. She has been in the business for over fifty years and has not lost her touch. CD is well worth the money
4,Great quick game with great replay value,"We have a Role Playing night every week and while we're waiting for everyone to show up and pizza to arrive we usually pull out a quick card game. This one is always in the top two choices. The game is quick, fun, easy to learn and different enough each game to keep it interesting. Only down side is a couple of rule points might be slightly vague and some people might not like the fact that the rules require you to make laser sound effects when you shoot your opponents (Otherwise your shots miss!)"
3,cheap,I don't know why these things are so expensive. I opted for a less expensive one and I sure got what I paid for.
1,Software problems,"Even after installing the last version (2.1.5.0 November 2002) of Movie Star 5 the software that comes with Station 200 I had a major struggle to make a home movie of 5 minutes duration. Retrieving a saved project with ""centered"" titles and an intact time line was impossible."
3,Yes this is not greatest book but it has value,"I am an 8/b enthusiast, so even though the 1 star reviewer makes valid points, this book still has value, because it emphasizes fundamentals that are essential to becoming a winner such as scooping the pot and avoiding one-way and weak hands. There are errors in the table and the book would benefit from better organization, but I have read everything I could get my hands on for 8/b and I found new and worthwhile information. However, I wouldn't recommend this without first reading other material. A better choice for the intermediate would be Todd Brunson's Chapter in Super System 2. Thanks Todd Brunson, for such a wonderful and concise explanation of the game!"
5,Terrific new author,"I generally don't read horror, but I work with this author and really wanted to see if his book was as good as his newspaper columns. So I lit every light in the room (on a sunny day) and dove in. I was expecting something unusual from a guy who has his desk decorated for Halloween 365 days a year, and I got it. Wonderfully written and way too real for this scaredy cat. Eeek!"
2,Expose'd,"Boring! What got ""expose'd"" here was Mr. Epstein's narcissism and the lack of depth in his own friendships. By page 83(the height of his self-hugging,)I wanted to puke all over his cashmere.Better writers at least cloak their egotism in reasonably sincere humilityso that readers don't gag. And his chapter on the friendships of women was threaded with such sweeping stereotypical broadstrokes as to be completely laughable when read by this woman...."
1,Cheap Quality,Don't waste your money on this. My husband had gotten me one of these as a gift a few years ago & it stopped working within minutes of the second time I turned it on. Before it broke the motor was constantly straining & it never felt hot at all.
4,Opposites is a good book for older toddlers.,"My 14 month old son loves the sign language books I've given him. He likes the brightly colored pictures in this book and the close up pictures of children's faces. This book contains signs for words such as big/little, sad/happy, and wet/dry. The words in this book seem fit for a little older toddler to me, but he does really seem to like looking at the pictures. The black and white illustrations of how to do the signs are easy to understand. The book is also a nice size for little toddler hands. A big thumbs up here!"
3,Cast a Giant Shadow Eclipsed by Its Cast,"Kirk Douglas, John Wayne, Yul Brenner and a truly ensemble cast provide the electricity, the spark, if you will, that makes this film worth watching. The film is just okay because it is dated and the production values reflect as much, but the the story it tells is a remarkable one, because it is a true story, and serves as a reminder, that the cost of freedom, is anything but free."
3,Enduring Tale That's Unforgettable,"Fourteen year old Kenny wants to be a cowboy like Roddy. Shortly after his father announces that he is getting remarried, he dies in an airplane crash.Kenny is left adjusting to the now unfulfilled promises of death as well as his feelings toward Cynthia who is a senior in high school. His choice to protect her could cost him his freedom.Cynthia just wants to escape her father's seemingly unjustified hatred toward her. She searches for the answers as she tries to form a relationship with Roddy, defying all her father's wishes as she goes.Lenna, Kenny's mother, is also dealing with the death of her ex-husband and her lust for Roddy. She realizes she is too old for him but she can't seem to stay away from his charms as he lures her into his already full life.In between rodeos, Roddy gains the attentions of both Lenna and Cynthia. He manages to keep them apart for a while. More than sparks fly when the two ladies come face to face."
5,"Simply Fine, with a twist...!!!","I bought this music with hopes of what I thought it would be and was delightfully laid back with what I heard. Can't put it into words, so you'll have to give it a listen yourself; I feel sure it'd be a nice addition to anyone's library who enjoys the sort of jazzy, slightly bluesy, soft music w/ a little vocals here and there. :)"
2,Not much Jeff Speakman in the movie,"I bought this movie for I wanted to watch Jeff Speakman. Before buying this product I however, read the reviews and already knew that there's not much Jeff Speakman Kenpo action.Still I placed an order - I just wanted to collect all movies that has even a minor presence of Mr. Speakman.The movie is being sold by Zoverstocks who send this product from the UK. The arrival took about 20 days from the date of despatch. However, the wait was ok, considering the price of the product is incredibly low at 1 cent ($0.01). with shipping it cost me $2.99.the storyline of the movie is a definite B grade. No good, but if you are a Speakman fan, and you want to have all movies in which he even had a smallest part, buy it.PS: The Picture and sound quality of the movie is good, but no subtitles available if I am not mistaken."
2,Eh....,"Well... um... yeah. Not the best DVD I've ever purchased. BTW, Jeff Speakman fans - don't bother with this one if you're interested in seeing more of Mr. Speakman's expertise in Kenpo - it's not there. The movie itself - it's adequate. It killed some time."
4,Memory Lane book,"Though not as good as the Foxfire series, this is a fun read about how to make toys from everyday items found around the house. You'll learn how to make kites, tops, whistles, rubber band guns and many more. It's a lot of fun."
1,not for a small engine,The plug looks fine but it says it will fit nearly any small engine. This will not fit any small engine I have ever seen or used these plugs are big. about 3 inches long and about an inch wide huge plug. if you have an older engine it might fit it. the only reason I only gave 1 star is because it says fits any small engine and it will not fit any small engine i have.
3,Not much of a pot of gold at the end of this rainbow,"This is a pleasant enough movie, but Fred Astaire is showing his age. Ptula Clark is OK, but Don Francks is a zero as the romantic lead. The music IS wonderful, and the video quality is good, but the story is pretty hokey. Not on the A list, but it does round out a musical theater collection."
1,Not A Very Good Version Of A Classic Musical.,"In 1954,there was a Frank Sinatra project of this film.Along with MR Sinatra was Ella Logan,Barry Fitzgerald,Louis Armstong,Ella Fitzgerald,and Jim Bacus.An animated cartoon with lots of great tunes.The scoring and recording were done than tragedy struck.They ran out of money.Needless to say the film was never completed.Frank was to play Woody.The Sinatra songs came out on the CD set,Sinatra In Hollywood.Its a shame that version wasnt done.Thats life."
4,"Great soundtrack, good standalone music.","The soundtrack for the Hulk is a magnificent, inspired piece of art that fits the film perfectly. I've seen people compare it to (Elfman's other soundtrack) Spiderman, which I find odd since Hulk the film is nothing like Spiderman. It's not a superhero story as much as a unique drama injected with something more (in this case science fiction).The soundtrack therefore isn't a standard 'superhero' soundtrack (like Spidey, Batman, and The Flash: all Elfman creation).From the slow-paced music to the mid-eastern touch, this package is a superb showcase for Danny Elfman's talent"
3,Interesting eclectic mix of non-traditional Elfman music,"Yes, there is alot of percussion which is a staple of Elfman, but in writing the music for a their super-hero franchise, Elfman breaks new ground. Rather than the dark flourishes of Batman & the high flying theme of Spider-Man, The Hulk is a dark score filled witth exotic sounds that actually capture the filmakers vision and provide an interesting listening experience for the listener. I gave this score 3 stars not because its bad, but because its not to my personal taste, and I would not necessarily recommend it. However, if you a collector of Danny Elfman music or super-hero scores, then feel no guilt when you purchase this unique score."
5,As Good as the movie!!,"Yo, this cd is one of the best musical scores i think i have ever heard. It is of course NOWHERE near as good as the 'SIGNS' soundtrack, but none the less this is an awsome cd. And also the last song performed by the originall Guns n Roses with Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots is an awsome song. so if you enjoy good musical scores i suggest you get this album, WORD UP!! and buy the SIGNS soundtrack too, youll appreciate it."
3,Pretty typical soundtrack,"Composer Danny Elfman does nothing to reinvent the blockbuster summer soundtrack genre, though this Incredible Hulk album does have some fairly fine moments. It's a tad long for my taste, and the song titles really annoy me, due to their overall cheesiness. Overall, this stuff is kind of boring, and it's not until the last Guns 'n' Roses song that things really pick up. The boys sound pretty good on ""Set Me Free,"" and it could be the song that brings them back from the dead.As Bruce Banner always says, ""You wouldn't like me when I'm angry!""LATER!!!"
5,A Monumental Accomplishment,"This is a fantastic bibliography of 2,198 publications and sources for CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) research. It is a monumental accomplishment and should be available in every library and university. I answer inquiries from the Internet about the CCC and have begun to recommend either the purchase of this book or that inquiring individuals ask their libraries to order it. It would have saved me years of research and writing Gold Medal CCC Company 1538: A Documentary, if it had been available then. The book is broken down into various categories, which greatly facilitate CCC research. It is an invaluable research tool. I would give a 10 star rating if 5 stars weren't the upper limit. Larry Sypolt has made a tremendous contribution to promote awareness of this neglected, but deserving, part of American history."
5,good educational toy,It's a great product unfortunately they no longer make it so its hard to find games and extras for it.
4,BRING BACK ANDY!,"Andy Rooney has been a regular on the popular TV show 60 Minutes since 1978, and if you're a devoted fan of the show like me, you MAKE time in your busy schedule to relax in front of your TV and listen to Andy's wry essays on American life. By the end of them, I'm sure it can be agreed that most of us either find ourselves on the floor convulsing from laughter, or saying to ourselves ""What on earth possessed that man to write about something like THAT!"" Well in case you just can't get enough of Andy Rooney, I suggest reading this incredible book. It is filled with a variety of essays writen by Andy on everything from fences, to hair, to even a clever editorial on profanity. What I enjoy most about Mr. Rooney's style is that he ""tells it like it is."" He finds a way to tastefully poke fun at the most random American quirks and celebrates the uncelebrated. THIS BOOK SHOULD DEFINATELY BE PUT BACK IN PRINT!!! He is a very talented writer who has style all his own."
3,A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED!!!!,"I bought this book after reading all the reviews the other readers gave the book. All of the reviewers gave this book five stars, did I miss something??? I wouldn't call this book bad but it was more long winded chatter than romance....The romance in the book is good, but Lori Foster does not really focus on that, she goe's on and on about Cliff and his relationship to his sister, and well a bunch of other stuff that doesn't matter in a romance novel... I admit I was disappointed, but gave it three stars because it's a Lori Foster book...What the heck!!!!"
3,Abbotts needed more screen time,"Well, two of them did. Liv Tyler is the weak spot but she gets the most screen time, while Joanna Going and Jennifer Connelly are pushed aside for the most part. Crudup and Phoenix do a good job, as does Kathy Baker. The script leaves you feeling that scenes were deleted. You wonder why the Abbotts are such a big deal."
5,I am looking forward to the sequel of this great movie,this movie is one of my favorites. i love the whole story. This movie is such a good one for many reasons. the whole love story between Tyler and Phoenix. Then how Jacey is infatuated with the Abbot girls. I hope their is a sequel just to show how the family interacts with Doug as he is now apart of it and what happend to Jacey and Eleanor. Hopefully if there is a sequel the director should try the same exact cast. Thats what made me love it even more.Jacey is so good looking he has the right attitude to play that character. Its that sly type he makes u want him even though his looks can do that for him . well i give it 5 stars. and i hope there is a sequel real soon
1,Electricians skip this one -- crouching rips them,The seat ripped out on me the second day of work. Wrangler has not responded to my request for refund after more than two weeks.
5,Firefly (original TV soundtrack,"This theme music is haunting. It also predates the Avatar soundtrack by several years, but, to me is more intense. This CD is excellent 'road music' for traveling in the car. I really enjoy it."
3,Not as good as I wanted it to be,"With soundtracks, rather than short cues lifted straight from the show or movie, I usually prefer the musical cues to be compiled or otherwise strung together to make much longer overture-type musical pieces. Such provides a richer overall listening experience in many cases. So, its very difficult that I say -- since I love ""Firefly"" and Greg Edmondson's musical score -- that with this CD, the tracks end too soon -- just as you're getting into the mood of the music. I'd have rather heard longer variations of one theme or another strung together, than say, the part where such-and-such happens in episode 5, standing pretty much alone. I guess I shouldn't complain, since we're very lucky that this CD was even produced for such a short-run TV show."
5,Great Music!,"I absolutely loved this CD. It captures all of the music from the series. The majority of the music is very serene and calming. Its a great mix of acoustical guitar, Celtic and traditional Chinese (flute) music. Listening to the CD takes me back to the shows.Greg Edmonson did an excellent job composing the music. He really captured the essence of the show. I think it was a bad move on Joss Whedon's part to not go with Edmonson for the movie's soundtrack (Serenity). This CD is a must have for great music lovers, be it acoustic, classical or Celtic. This is one of my favorite soundtracks of all time."
2,Disapointed,This seemed like a good idea but some of the tea comes through the covering and settles in the cup
1,"American Nation, less than great","ok, whoever thinks this book is good is wrong. I'm taking History using this book and no one likes it. We have probably used it 3 times this year because even our teacher doesn't like this book. Don't you dare buy it, you'll regret it. REMEMBER NOT TO BUY THIS!"
2,Complex,This is not a book for someone needing to learn to understand the dynamics behind vibrations and sound. It does a poor job of explaining the fundamentals and steps involved in derivations. Definitely for the advanced reader.
3,Way too gentle,"Very appropriate for complete beginners. Instructor leads you carefully into the different segments, which is really nice if you're new to yoga. But having been practicing for a while, it gets kind of boring. It found it hard to stick with the practice. I also found it rather distracting to have so many 'yogis' on the set. If you're looking for a truly relaxing yoga experience that will get you ready for bed, I'd recommend the Barbara Benagh DVD's.I would still recommend this for people that are new to yoga and are seeking for a gentle approach."
4,Easy to follow,"I really like this video because it's simple to follow for beginners. Someone in the group is showing an alternate version of the poses they're doing so you don't feel like giving up easily if it's too dificult. I am not a very flexible person, and the poses they use are not extremely out of this world where you think, ""yeah right, I'll never be able to do that--EVER!"""
3,"Some of Elvis' best and worst films, together in a package.","Two of EP's better films along with two of his worst. I enjoyed Elvis in ""Follow That Dream"" as well as, ""Kid Galahad"". ""Clambake"" and ""Frankie And Johnny were pretty lame."
4,Dora is a big sister!,"Nick Jr. recently showed the ""Dora the Explorer: Big Sister Dora"" episode on tv. My daughters (ages 11mo. and 23mo.) LOVED it! My oldest especially enjoyed it because she is a huge Dora fan and I think she liked that they were both big sisters. It was a cute video and sure to be a hit with any Dora fan."
2,"Great potential, but I dislike one song","This DVD is well made and has a lot of great songs, but the song ""anything you can do, I can do better"" sort of kills the deal for me. Take this song out, and I think you have a great DVD."
2,Kidsongs=Ride the Rollercoaster,Terrible audio quality. Music background was to loud so you could not hear the people . I would not reccomend this product to anyone. My grandson was so disappointed and sad.
3,Basic and cheap,"I bought this fun factory to replace our one that cracked and this one is just as cheaply made and I suspect will crack again, but its still a fun toy that my daughter loves!"
5,GREAT!,This is by far the best book on toy dog's that I have ever read. Ms. Arden's love for toy dogs shines from every page. She does an excellent job of capturing the heart and spirit of the breeds in her book. I especially love the picture of the little Peke carrying a leaf by the stem on page 48. Ms. Arden has meticulously researched all aspects of toy dog ownership. This is a must book for anyone who is interested in toy dogs.
1,Administer Estate,This book directs a person who becomes an executor of an estate to follow a path that leads to probate court. I was looking for how to administer an estate when it was in a trust. I had to buy a different book to find the answers to my questions.
5,absolutely tops,"My purchase was a book I have been looking for for quite a number of years. Amazon was suggested by a friend who had already purchases a number of items and so I went looking, found my book and purchased it. It arrived here in Australia in just over a week, well packaged and in great condition. I will definitely deal with Amazon again so thank you for the very great pleasure revisiting this book gives me. Cheers & blessings, Carmel Smith, Australia"
3,Great at first,"This is a simple and useful tool designed to augment the ease in cutting 1/2 inch and 1/4 inch hoses in order to assemble water conserving systems for gardens. However, it is not durable; after numerous cuts, the thin, hollow ground blade wears in the 1/2 inch slot and does not cut much better than good garden shears. I have not yet found out whether the blade is replaceable or what the cost may be. It was great while it lasted but I expected more for the price."
1,over priced/poor condition,"I received the paperback book, the pages were yellowed, small print. It looked like it had gotten sunlight. The spine was not the greatest. They charged me more than the original price.Greg"
5,The best places for romance,"This book offers the best places for romance in and around Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Dallas/Fort Worth, Corpus Christi, the Rio Grande Valley and the Mexican border. Only those lodgings with special appeal have been selected, and all have been visited by the author - former Houston Chronicle editor.Table For Two sections profile the most intimate places to eat, where ambiance and service are as important as the food. But this is more than a guide to the best places to stay and eat. Activities that a couple will remember forever are also covered - balloon rides over the desert, romantic strolls under a starry sky, horseback trails into the wilderness. Contact names, telephone numbers and website addresses are given. Maps, index and photos, plus hand-drawn sketches."
4,Sturdy!,"They're pet bowls. If the standard is bowliness, I'd have to say that these bowls are the bowliest. That's what you're looking for, right?"
1,no energy- boring--same old story,what do you know another album from pennywise no wonder they come out with so many the songs must take all of 15 minutes to make up this album is good for one thing and thats putting me to sleep nothing interesting to see here just more of the same sounds like all the other records they have realesed and thats not a good thing
5,The best out of me cellphone history,"When I was a Sprint customer, I was very satisfied with everything this phone had to offer. The phone always kept a decent singal, and the extended battery actually had an extented life unlike others from different manufacturers. After 6 months, I lost it in a shopping mall. Fortunately, I had insurance and Sprint replaced it with a Sanyo 5500. Yeah the 5500 was blue, Readly Link enabled, and had a video camera, but it gave me a whole lot of drama along with Sprint's terrible customer service, which resulted into me cancelling my contract. It is a shame Sprint discontinued this model as opposed to the Sanyp 8100. For those who already have or intend on purchasing this phone, use it until it cannot be use anymore before upgrading to a new model."
1,"MY MISTAKE, ONLY 55 CAPSULES","Beware when you order this product. There is one suplier that has a slightly lower price, but the quantity is only 55 capsules. All the other suppliers were 80 capsules. My fault that I did not read carefully. This is a good product, I just overpaid for what I received. ""LET THE BUYER BEWARE""."
4,Great product,"This was a good transaction--item arrived quickly and was just as described. If you are looking for Cosequin to help relieve joint pain for your cat, this is the place to get it!"
5,Good stuff-- good price,"I give this to my 12 yr old kitty - I give her the contents of one capsule a day (I open up the capsule and mix it with her wet food), and she scarfs it down in her wet food. She's doing fine as far as jumping and moving around are concerned-- seems to be helping her be a bit more active as far as jumping is concerned.This is similar to Glucosamine/Chondroitin for humans-- however it's made for cats in a Specific Dosage and Formulation, and has chicken flavor, which also makes it much more appealing to them.Check with your vet FIRST, if your cat has KIDNEY problems-- to make SURE you can give this to your cat."
1,My cat wouldn't touch this.,"I had high hopes for this after reading many positive reviews. Unfortunately, my cat would not touch his food after one of these ""sprinkle capsules"" had been emptied onto it. I didn't make a real effort to administer the capsule whole, as it is fairly large for a cat. I'm happy for those who had success with this product, and wish I had been among them."
4,Seems to work well,"With products of this type, reviews tend to be very subjective and based on observation rather than fact. Having said that, I feel this product has increased the mobility of my 8 year old street rescue, Louie. He has never been a jumper, but his activity levels have increased since taking this product - our vet believes he has arthritis due to agd and lifestyle. I would recommend it as a starting point for any cat that joint / mobility issues."
5,Great product!,"My cat was recently diagnosed with arthritis. He was reluctant to jump, slow moving, and when he did move he was walking oddly. Within a matter of days of starting the Cosequin, I noticed the funny walk was gone. The steady improvements have continued. He's now been on it for about a month. Just the other day I noticed he's running up stairs again, no hesitation about jumping on the counters, etc. I'm so glad the vet recommended this product. The pain medications for cats are so limited and the one that was recommended as safe didn't seem to take the pain away at all. My cat seems much more comfortable now. The product is quite a bit cheaper on Amazon than at my local vet's office. Just be sure to buy from a reputable seller."
4,Cosequin for my cat,"My cat is approx. 14 yrs. old. He had been sleeping an awful lot and I was getting worried. I know some will say he is old for a cat, but I did not want to accept this as an answer. He had problems with a leg that he had broken from a car accident and I noticed a little limp. When I gave him cosequin, within two weeks he was not sleeping as much and he seemed to be walking better. I also believe he is getting more muscle in his bad leg. His appetite has also picked up. The only problem I have with cosequin now is that it is hard to get him to take it, so I am going to get some brewsers yeast powder and mix it with the cosequin as suggested by another reviewer and I hope this works, because I do believe it is helping him."
5,Best thing I ever did for my cat,"She is 16 years old, and was having a hard time getting up on anything. Spent most of her days and nights sleeping under a desk upstairs. After 2 weeks on Cosequin, she is up and about most of the time we are home. She jumps up on my lap like years ago, is all around a happier and healthier cat. I wish I'd given here these years ago."
1,Vomitting/Diarrhea,"After feeding Cosequin to my cat mixing with his wet food, he started vomiting and had recurring bouts of diarrhea. I tried feeding for 4 days, and after his apparent discomfort I discontinued and the side effects ended a few days later. If your cat is a picky eater or has a sensitive stomach...be aware this may not be for your kitty."
5,"I was a skeptic, but our cat convinced me ...","I'm skeptical of many of the treatments recommended by vets (brush my cat's teeth - that ain't gonna happen). But when Charlie (our active and agile 12-year-old domestic short hair) started having trouble jumping up onto the bed, the vet recommended Cosequin. One tab a day sprinkled on his Friskies and he didn't seem to mind the taste. After a couple of weeks his jumping seemed to improve, and after a month he wasn't having any problems at all. Six months later and all is still well, so I'm a skeptic no more. Buying the exact same product here on Amazon is less than half the vet's price, so it's relatively reasonable and we plan to continue the daily treatment. There's no such thing as a miracle drug, but Cosequin has directly and effectively addressed our cat's problem. Highly recommended if you see symptoms of slowing down, difficulty jumping or possible pain or stiffness in your feline friend."
2,Questionable Ingredients,"The problem with this supplement is the non active ingredients it contains including Red and Blue coloring. It also contains the surfactant sodium lauryl sulfate. I would prefer if this product had all natural ingredients. The coloring is purely for human benefit - it doesn't affect our cats. I prefer cat food as well as supplements that are human grade and have no artificial ingredients so I have purchased the ""human"" version of this product and adjust the dose accordingly.Ingredients:Glucosamine hydrochloride (derived from shellfish), sodium chondroitin sulfate (derived from bovine cartilage), gelatin, natural chicken flavor, natural tuna flavor, water, manganese ascorbate, mixed glycosaminoglycans, magnesium stearate, titanium dioxide, FD&C; Red #3, sodium lauryl sulfate, and FD&C; Blue #1."
4,For Bladder also,"The vet recommended this for one of our ""kids"" when she was around 11 years old and started having UTI's. I didn't really believe it would help much, but anything that might save her some pain, so we started with this.I am pleased to say that they do seem to help her. And not just with her urinary tract but her joints as well, just as the product claims. After about 3 weeks on the cosequin she seemed to be getting around easier and playing more.I made the mistake of running out and within 2 months she was back at the vet with a UTI. So I am back ordering more and I will be sure to keep them on hand.They do fluctuate in price a lot, so shop around.They are very easy to give to you cat as they are in capsule form. Just open them up and sprinkle them in the food. We have had no problems with them that way."
4,I agree. It helps!,"I agree with everyone else! This seems to help a lot. Try it. I've been using it 6 months. My poor cat (17) does have arthritis and still can't jump well. But, she is up and down the stairs often and uses her wits to get on the bathroom counter, etc. (i wish she wouldn't. It hurts my joints to watch her jump off.) She moves around a lot more than she did 6 months ago! I recently read somewhere on the internet,that this may increase blood pressure. So, I just had my veterinarian check my cat's blood pressure and it was great. Who knows about the veracity of that information.We thought that our cat would fight us about taking a pill every day. I bought Greenies to hide the pill in. She didn't care for the treat at all and will take the pill via a pill popper! My husband handles it, and gives her treats and praise afterward. She now comes to get him when it's time for her daily pill. It warms my heart."
3,bonus disc,"Consider the fourth disc to Air Tv just a bonus disc. The first three disc's are what make this anime great. If you have already seen the first three dvd's, it leaves the series as it should. Do not expect this dvd to further the story. The first episode is a summary of the first three dvd's, and the other two episodes are extended scenes of the girls past. It was a fine dvd, but the anime really ends on disc three."
5,Single Sheiff seeks....,"Dan's sister and the whole town put an ad in Texas men with out Dan's knowledge .They set up a plan to concerning disappearing Barbies. So that Dan will have to see Annie.Rachel, Annie's sister convinces her to answer Dan's ad. This story is funny and romantic.Has a great ending too."
3,"chest made from flat, cardboard-like material","I removed the flat frontal side and made muscles for this costume out of pillow material because the whole frontal side was cardboard-like and too uncomfortable to be worn by an active four year old who wanted to wear it all day long even for bed time. The mask was the most batman like mask I have seen but it did not fit well, too lose. It might fit better in a six year old than a four year old. The boots are small attachments to the pant legs and have no soles."
2,Mac bias,This book is strictly for beginners. Lots of good information but Robin Williams has a very BIG Mac bias and repeatedly bashes any Windows program. Also her Photoshop tips are for an old version and aren't very helpful.
4,the book was good and i was happy,I did not pay too much for it. At the book store it cast $28.00. I like the book a lot.
3,"Strong base, but very jumpy","I got this book to review my Microsoft XML practices. This book does an extreme number of forward page jumping - one or 2 errors. But it also does a fairly good job of backwards page referencing. The consistency of using one subject and format is awesome as you actually build on a starting foundation. While the author seems to lead you in a good direction, he introduces things that he doesn't give detail on until a few pages later. He seems to mention a lot of things that make what he's currently talking about confusing because he'll ""Introduce it later in the chapter"" or X amount of pages ahead. Make sure you get another book along with this one. Overall it's not a bad book."
4,"Great album, good fusion","it's not as spacey as a goa trance album and it won't make you want to do weed while your listening to it, but if you want a beautiful set of fused songs with indian vocal, get this album."
4,"Surprise, suprise","I was quite intrigued by this video when I first saw it on the shelf and read the back cover, thinking "" What the heck, I'll give it a try."" I am impressed! From the very first workout, I could feel my abs really working and the very next day, believe it or not, I could actually see a difference! My stomach got flatter and my sides definitely narrowed. I am extremely pleased with this video and highly recommend it. It is effective, fun and easy to follow. I'm just starting out with this workout, but I'm quite confident this is the one that will help me get leaner and more defined abs. Great workout!"
3,Abs for Dummies,"It is not at easy to follow as i thought it would be, It is a good exercise video but not for overweight people."
5,Best Caulk I have ever used.,"I had read through reviews of caulking on many websites and this particular product came up a few times but being sceptical, I searched for a store that had this brand and was able to find one that had a tube. The Sashco website listed about 6 places close by that carry their products and all but one even knew what I was talking about and lucky for me they had a supply. I bought one and used it around my garage door and was extremely satisfied with its capabilities and ease of use. I subsequently bought the Almond colored one through Amazon which matched the outside color of my home. It was extremely easy to apply and clean-up was quick and easy. After it dried completely you can tell by feel and looks that this was an outstanding product. I later found out from some friends that this brand is used by many building contractors. I would highly recommend this product brand."
3,Research,This is a good book for researching about pirates or for anyone whose curious to learn the non-Hollywood version of piracy.
2,Only if you LOVE Jackie Chan,"I wouldn't recommend this movie much unless you are a hard core Jackie devotee. There are some really good fight scenes, but the story is so incredibly DUMB that it can be hard to sit through at times. This one's definitely worth renting, though. I would rank it somewhere between Fearless Hyena (which I hated) and Snake in Eagle's Shadow (which I thought was pretty good)."
2,"VERY ""CUTE"" EARLY JACKIE CHAN MOVIE.","THIS IS ONE OF THE EARLY JACKIE CHAN FILMS THAT WAS MADE BEFORE HE HIT IT BIG. THERE ARE QUITE A FEW THAT WERE RELEASED AFTER HE HIT IT BIG, AND THIS ONE IS ONE OF THE BETTER CHOERGRAPHED FIGHT SCENES AND SHOWS THE BEGINING OF JACKIE'S COMEDY. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT TO SOME ONE NEW TO MARTIAL ARTS GENRE, IT HAS A VERY CUTE PLOT AND SOME FAST ACTION FIGHT SCENES. THE ONLY PROLEM IS THE TRANSFER TO DVD WAS VERY POOR. THERE IS NO WIDE SCREEN AND THE PAN AND SCAN SEEMED LIKE IT WAS DONE IN ZOOM. I HAD THE VIDEO FOR YEARS AND IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE BEFORE, YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW WHATS GOING ON IN SOME FIGHT SCENES. THEY ARE ZOOMED IN SO CLOSE, THAT SOMETIMES IT LOOKS LIKE A PERSON IS FIGHTING BY THEMSELVES."
1,"Hot Cardio, or Cold Let-Down","I was very excited to see what this tape had to offer. I noticed that there was an instuctional section of the DVD. Not thinking twice about it, I started this workout full-force, only to find myself completely standing still. The choreography is atrocious. I tried my hardest to keep up with her, only to find out that once I mastered a move, they were onto the next confusing move. Not being a professional dancer put me at an extreme disadvantage. But I also did not expect to be buying a ""dance"" workout! I tried to give this workout a chance, and decided to try to navigate through the instructional section. No wonder I couldn't follow. The combinations are too complex. Maybe I am alone in my opinion, but when I get dressed to exercise, I want to burn calories and sweat. I DO NOT want to master some useless ""dance routine."" I applaude anyone who can see this workout to it's completion.With all that being said, would anyone like to purchase a slightly used copy of this DVD?"
2,Too basic,This is so basic of a weight training book that only a beginner might glean something from it. It doesn't get too far into the specialties of physiology around the sport. I think that this book would be good for someone just starting a basic weightlifting program.
3,Do yourself a favor . . .,". . and step up. This bow left a lot to be desired. If your beginner archer is big enough for this bow, I would suggest going to the Vortex by Barnett. We did - quickly. It was simply underpowered and under equipped to be anything other than a quickly forgotten toy."
4,"Not great quality, but OK","That is all I want to say, but these reviews require me to say more. I don't think more is necessary!"
3,My least favorite of her books,"I think Charlotte Moss is a wonderful designer and love her books. This one, however, is my least favorite. First, it is actually a very small book - not only in the number of pages, but the length and width is much smaller than most decorating/design books. Second, it is one of those books that is nice to look at once. I won't be grabbing it over and over for inspiration."
3,interesting,it has some interesting ideas and such. It didn't costs that much anyways. Would probably buy again. Not a bad book
4,A great story!,This book was hard to put down. Romayne and James are very likeable characters and the story is not confined to the usual social stuffiness. The portions in Scotland are exciting and lead to the suspenseful conclusion in London. It is a very passionate story...the attraction between James and Romayne is powerful and the romance is definitely believable. This story kept me hooked until the very end.
5,More than just the recent politics,"What I liked about this book is that most of it covers Mr. Wilson's governmental career and the countries he lived in and the cultures he grew to love. He's speaks very favorably of the first president Bush and of president Clinton. I liked the look inside of the work he did overseas and then what happened to him and his wife at the hands of the current adminstration as punishment for speaking out about what he found. Mr Wilson is truely an independent when it comes to politics, so you can't paint him as a liberal when it comes to not liking what he unveils about the current Bush administration. If he ever reads this, I just want to say thank you (both you and your wife) for your service and for being brave enough to stand up and say the truth. What was done to you and your family was criminal, and I sincerely hope that justice prevails and it never happens again."
4,Good Stuff!,When someone writes about the truth...it always seems to fly below the surface. We must deal with the truth and make changes. Hold those people that distort the truth accountable. Joe Wilson does this and he and his wife pay the price for being true patriots. It seems like in history as a country we never learn from our mistakes and ignore the truth. This book is nothing but the truth....can you handle the truth?
1,The Politics of truth by Joseph Wilson,I found this book very interesting and informative. It was well constructed and the only disappointment I had with it was that it finished too early. More comments about the last presidential election and its aftermath would have been most welcome
1,Not the same as it used to be.,"I purchased one of these exact models about 3 years ago and I love it. Still works great. Scroll wheel is fluid, clicks provide good feedback yet not overly loud and clacky.I purchased a 2nd one for my office last week. Seems like a totally different mouse. Very harsh, rough, jittery scroll wheel. Loud & clumsy button clicks. Cord is super kinked. The quality on these has really gone down. I would speculate that the factory in China was switched to a different one.Look for something else. This performs like bottom of the barrel mice."
4,desk rodent,This bright eyed little desk rodent makes my computer function without fail. I didn't give it 5 stars only because left clicking on the screen scroll bar with this mouse takes big jumps rather than tiny moves that I was used to with my old dead mouse. I haven't been able to adjust that movement to my liking. Desk dust doesn't matter anymore with the optical movement.
4,Not a right hand mouse AND quality inconsistent,Bought 2 - same lot per packages but one has a funky right click (slow response). Despite pic this is NOT a right handed mouse; the contour is identical on both sides. Is USB but comes with USB to PS/2 connector that *actually* works as such (YEAH! and I can use it as an USB when I upgrade!). I'd give it a five except for the funky mouse which my husband (who doesn't use a right click as much as I do) has volunteered to use (isn't he a prince?).
3,Just Fair,"I use the manual scrolling function all day long, but if I touch the scroll wheel on this mouse a bit too hard then the auto scroll feature is launched and I have to touch it again to cancel--and that's beginning to get tedious. The Logitech wheel mouse I replaced took a bit firmer push to launch auto scroll.My main knock on this mouse is that it audibly vibrates when I move it. It's just cheaply made and the left and right buttons buzz/vibrate when I move the mouse and put it back down on the mouse pad. Annoying. Not nearly the quality of the Logitech mouse.I'm going back to Logitech."
5,Love these shoes!,"I love these shoes VERY comfortable, but DO run about a half size to big, I just used a gel insert. I do recommend ordering a half size smaller! Very sexy and sassy! Can be dressed up or down!"
5,Best shoes ever!!!,First let me say that i love naughty monkey shoes! nect these shoes are extremely comfortable and even with the high heel. The color is said to be green but is more or less brown with some army green accents. Thank you for another great pair of shoes.
2,Don't waste your time,"The movie was only 90 minutes, but at least 20 of those were flash backs from the first one. The hillbilly cannibals are all of a sudden hillbilly cannibals on motorbikes. And NO ONE dies until the last 20 minutes. Need I say more?"
3,Was alright to some extents.,"I bought it to see what happened to the family after. You just barely get a taste of what happened to Ruby and the son. The movie doesnt even really add alot of scares and nail biting moments. I was hoping for the old school scares like we got for the original Texas Chainsaws. Even now, those were the better of most this current day and age. As many classmates and I discuss, you can still imagine or see a family like those from the Texas Chainsaw or the Sawyers if you will. Maybe save your cash and find those original one and be shocked at how scary many of our top movie stars are today."
3,FLASHBACK,"There's a scene [well, scenes] where all of the remaining central characters are having flashbacks, one by one we see a minds-eye view of that characters experience. After the humans are done the camera pans to the annoying dog that's along for the ride and whaddaya know, he has a flashback to share as well. Yes you read right, THE DOG HAS A FLASHBACK. If that scene doesn't send you off the couch and rolling across the floor in a fit of laughter then brother, check your pulse! A five star scene in a two star film, I'll average it at 3 for the bald dude."
2,Pluto is back!,"This time out,a group motocross racers on their way to a tournament,and their bus breaks down conventially in the desert where Pluto(who was killed by the dog in the first movie)and the Reaper are hiding in the hills waiting to terrioze those unlucky enough to end up in their neck of the woods.The Hills Have Eyes Part 2 is an unessecary sequel,Pluto was only human and the family dog killed him,he can't come back to life hello!The group of teens tries to fight off Pluto and the REaper.Worthless waste of time,I have saw movies that were a lot a worse,but this one should still be passed up."
1,One Star Because This Movie Is Unwatchable,"What a horrible sequel to a horror classic! Some of the cast from the original ""The Hills Have Eyes"" return to carry on the story. There's lots of bad acting and just plain stupidity. There was obviously no thought put into this film. The characters act brain dead and do the dumbest stuff to get themselves killed. There are numerous flashback sequences to the original film but when the dog has a flashback, I just rolled my eyes. This movie will insult your intelligence. Its hard to believe a horror movie can be this stupid. Also, the transfer looks horrible for a blu-ray film. Much of the action is very dark, murky, and grainy. Don't waste your money on this one!"
3,Not as good as the older models!,"I bought a Showtime when they came out back in the 90's. I've used it a LOT and have always thought it to be one of the best kitchen ""gadgets"" ever. It finally went ka-put this year. I bought what I thought to be the same model. Well I suppose it IS the same model, but I think they have cheapened the machines. The new one is LOUDER than the older one, plus it rotates the food at a faster rate. Cooks completely differently. No so crazy about this one. Plus, I was missing the heat reflector. Rather than return it to Amazon, which they said they would gladly accept the return, I decided to keep it and order a reflector from Ronco. After 3 months, I'm STILL waiting for the heat reflector. Ronco, you have CRAPY customer service!!!"
3,"Good video, but very slow","I've never done yoga before, but started with this one. It was great to hear the whole thing for about the first two times I watched it. After that, I've found that the only way to really get the benefits from it and not spend an hour listening to Sarah talk about yoga, is to keep the remote with me and try to zip through some of the setup. But it's a real pain, and I wish that there a section that allowed you to run through the entire workout at once, without spending 5 minutes to get into each pose."
5,"From novice to pro, and enyone who learns by other people's stories...","As a person beginning my education in sustainable home building, I found this book refreshing and encouraging, informative and conversational. Lots of other books are more technical and appropriate at certain times, of course, yet I found this authors style of creation simple in its ability to reach the novice and beyond, to anyone who learns by stories. Simultaneously, I found it a dynamic read, in the way that the stories he included spanned years of experience, trial and error, and wisdom of what our forefathers and mothers in this movement would have done differently. I enjoyed the basic education in how electricity works, and the emphasis on how important and simple (although maybe not always easy) it is to be ENERGY INDEPENDENT."
1,poor quality,I purchased a large number of these to give as gifts for my employees. Several of them had trouble locking the blade in place when opened so the blade could close on to your hand while in use. Also the belt clip broke off several of them when first used. You can do better. I have the version of this knife one size larger. I have had that one for a few years and love it.
4,Life @ Work,I have enjoyed this book as a bible study with three other guys. The book has some great examples but sometimes Maxwell repeats himself throughout the book. As a bible study this lesson can get long!
1,DREADFUL,"This can best be described as John Denver's attempt to impersonate Leonard Cohen. The lyrics are drivel, the arrangements stale, and the whole thing lacks any semblance of soul. Beware the hype."
5,Daido Moriyama by Nobuyoshi Araki,Book is well done - Beautiful photography ! Recommended to anyone that likes great photographs.
5,EXCELLENT quality and price,I am a professional jeweler and this is my new favorite tool. It's heavy duty yet great for delicate work. The blades are extremely sharp and durable and the angle is perfect. The grips are comfortable and are angled so that the leverage is perfect for jewelry use. Job well done. I will continue to buy my tools from this company. Finally a company that gets it! I've been disappointed by so many others.
1,NOT NEW HP PART AS ADVERTISED,"While I am sure the unit is working fine, and yes I did get a great deal on this--It was advertised as a genuine HP New kit and I got a rebuild or knock off, hard to say.I feel the selling company was deceptive--"
2,Far below the others in this series,"I'm currently reading this series. Most of the books are well-written and very enjoyable, but this one is definitely far below the average.The characterizations are surprisingly inept, and the plotting is so amateurish as to make the reader wonder if Donald Bain really wrote it.The biggest example (Spoiler Alert):A man is murdered in a hotel. Then someone tells Jessica that he remembers when the murdered man and his brother, who looked a lot like him, used to spend summers at the hotel when they were children. Then a witness swears that she's seen the murdered man alive and well. It takes Jessica Fletcher more than 100 pages to realize what every reader of mysteries sees immediately -- that it wasn't a ghost but the murdered man's identical twin brother whom the witness saw.The list of questions and answers about mystery writers, however, is very interesting."
4,Just plain fun!,"No More Bobs is a fun-filled romp into the life of Madison Lawhon, a single mom with a Bob problem-all the guys she has dated were named Bob and all were less than dream dates. Add to the mix: Jack Graham,a man with an agenda; a cast full of quirky characters; and some weird science that includes an aphrodisiac and mutated frogs and you're in for a good time. All in all, a very enjoyable read."
5,Guide for the single person,"I am neither a professional critic nor a book reviewer but I bought this book to give to a friend who had a boyfriend named...you guessed it, Bob. I wound up reading it myself and totally enjoyed it. It was fun, funny and well written with a great eye for scene discription. The charactors are well fleshed out and, although some are not really believable as real human beings, comedy is exageration of the truth after all, they are funny. I enjoyed it immensely and recommend it to all who like a light romantic comedy. As a Bay Area resident, I enjoyed trying to guess what real landmarks were given the ficticious names of the settings. Ms Borris has a very nice storytelling style and I look forward to reading her again, hopefully in the not-too-distant future."
1,Junk!,These boots where destroyed within about 4-5 days of regular use. your probably better off buying a better quality product.
5,Cinema and Colman Congradulated,"Having recently read the novel cover to cover, and falling madly in love with the character of Sydney Carton, I felt it was time to see MGM's take on the novel. So, I chose the 1935 version of A Tale Of Two Cities since I love the classics; and I hear that is rare for someone only seventeen! Anyways, Colman's performance of the beloved hopelessly and helplessly in love Carton, had me in happiness and romantic sympathy. I don't think I have ever been so emotionally shaken with any film like this one. It is a film that lays true enough to the novel, and to the characters. It is the best film adaption of the novel you can find, and the greatest performance of Sydney Carton you will ever hope to see. I raise a taost to Ronald Colman for his magnificence and grip on the character, and another toast to the entire film for keeping my eyes and mind on the story and its characters struggles in life and love, and the pursuit of self."
3,A Tale of Two Cities,"An old movie. Not as good as book that I just read, but ok. Star of movie who plays Carton is great. This is a good way to enjoy the book. Needs to be remade as a movie."
5,NICE READ,"This author's books are always a hoot. I bought copies as gifts for relatives and they really enjoyed them, as did I. If you like baseball, this is a charming book."
5,Two Tetralogies,"An Age of Kings BBC 1960. A 15 part series comprising Shakespeare's two tetralogies - English histories from Richard II through Richard III. A few of the actors are: Falstaff - Frank Pettingell, Hotspur - Sean Connery, Joan La Pucelle - Eileen Atkins, Katherine - Judy Dench."
5,Highly enjoyable.,"I'm a fan of British history more than of Shakespeare, but thought I would try this set out - it was highly rated, had Sean Connery (really!) and it's reasonably priced. I was surprised how pulled into the stories I was. The acting is wonderful - even, or especially pre-Bond Connery. He still has a thick Scottish accent, but he's cast a northern earl, so it's OK. Robert Hardy plays Henry V (the face on the DVD box, and is up to his usual high standards. Not better than Branagh, but different.If you're a Shakespeare fan, this is a must-have. In black and white, but that makes little difference. It does have (very well done) sub titles for us non-Shakespeare scholars. I started to Netflix the series, and after the first disc, decided to but the set. It's worth every penney."
5,AWESOME!,This book is amazing and will change the way you feel about chastity. it is very well written to work with teens and show the up side to living a chaste life!
5,So good I'm buying it for a third time,"It's a simple routine that I always come back to for basic strengthening and flexibility. The ability to choose one spot (10 mins ea) or two or three makes this easy to fit in your busy day and get targeted strengthening when and where you need it. It's easy to fit in 10 minutes in the AM -especially since it does not involve jumping around before your AM caffeine fix.No equipment needed, no frills, just the basics, but it works.Originally I had the VHS. Husband wanted to get rid of VCR but I was holding out because I loved this tape. Then he got it for me in DVD (buh bye VCR). Then a family member had a running injury and could not run or do aerobics, so I immediately thought of this workout and gave her my DVD. No jumping around, no impact, so it's great for your recovery days after long runs/hard core workouts or after injuries.Overall this is a critical piece of my workout arsenal and I highly recommend it."
1,NOT REAL PILATES,"If you're serious about pilates, don't go for this one. Most of the excercises are hybrids of the real pilates method, or not pilates at all. Also, only good for 1st timers, as the exercises are not challenging enough. I can't imagine this workout (if you can call it a workout at all) to get me into any kind of shape. Also, the instructor does not inspire me; her body is on the thicker, soft side, not the lean, muscular ""dancer's"" body you would expect from an insructor. Instead, I highly recommend Classical Pilates Technique-The Complete Mat Workout Series....now THAT'S serious pilates. Skip this one - it's been a waste of my money, and could be for you too."
2,Sissy Work out,"I was at the store looking for a pilates DVD and a by-stander said Crunch has a well known chain of gyms so it must be good, so I bought it. I got home flopped it in the DVD player,worked out, and was shocked when the lady told me I totally worked my abs when I felt absolutely nothing at all. You do a total of about 5 crunches. I am disappointed in the whimpy work out."
4,Great starter for Pilates,"I enjoy this DVD, but I find the routine less then challenging. I use it for a quick workout (it is 30 minutes), but the routine is very easy. I am coming from a walking (treadmill) routine to Pilates and I am pretty active. I didn't really feel that this was difficult enough to really make a difference.Ellen is very easy to follow and a good leader. The DVD also offers modifications for those who need to have an easier workout.I recommend it for beginners. It is a great start."
4,Good for beginning,I bought this video about a year ago. It's definately easier than other pilates videos I've tried. But it did get me results and give me more time to go out and jog or run on the treadmill. It's a little challenging at first but it does get easier.
5,Love this!,"Ellen is a master of pilates. I love this DVD. You have different sets you can do and it all feels so good. I have been doing this for a long time now and I have seen and felt results in my body and my clothes. I love Ellen's cues, her energy and the fact that she explains everything she's going to have you do and WHY. I love it. Get it. Your body will love you for it. Oh! Easy routines."
1,junk,"People,Toshiba knows these units power off that's why they sold most of them to third party dealers so they didn't have to pickup the repair price.Believe me i know i can't tell you the person's name who informed me."
2,toshiba hd-xa2 dvd player,sorry to say i had to send it to Toshiba service department due to high pitched whine when playing a dvd.for the price one would have hoped for a better product. john n...
4,Very Good,"This is very good product so far I have owned different HD upconversion players but from the HD upconverions and HD Disc player, I find HD-XA2 do better. With the format war going on between HD and Blu Ray it is the early seekers gamble. I liked all features except the remote control which designed very pathetic for the money spent on buying the player. I got universal remote and works really good. Picture quality is amazing on the 60"" Pioneer Plasma get 1080i/p and so is the sound quality on the Onkyo connected to Bose Accoustic mass.Cons: Remote control and slow startup and disc remembering feature, as it does remember where the scene was left if we power off.Overall for early divers into technology it is a very good buy."
5,BEST STANDARD DVD UPSCALING AVAILABLE,"The format war is over. Sadly, its outcome had nothing to do with consumer preference- HD was cheaper all around with picture quality comparable to Blu Ray. The format war was a textbook example of corporate manipulation overriding the free market.Still, most of us still rent standard definition DVDs, and there will be more standard definition DVDs than any other format for a long time to come. For that, the XA2 is an amazing bargain. I've owned Oppos. I've got the Panasonic BD 30, which has the best Blu Ray image available. The XA2 upscales standard DVDs better than any other DVD player, even making the 7' by 11' image from my Epson Home Cinema 1080 projector look as good as HD."
1,The Smile of the Walrus,The Smile of the Walrus (The Under Sea World of Jacques Cousteau) [VHS]Too bad we never received the order that was placed. The mail came in without any content in it.
5,Great product,"At a great price. I compared shop and yours was by far cheaper, but great quality. I always buy NOW products, thanks for the great buy."
2,No noticeable effect,This brand of 5-Htp had a barely noticeable effect. I usually can feel the effect of Trypophen. I will not buy again.
2,not Working For Me,"I purchased two different brands of 5-HTP both in 50mg capsules, the first brand I tried was a small bottle of Natrol 5-HTP which seemed to help somewhat with my sleep for the first weeks, then I started to have nightmares one after the other awakening sometimes 5 to 20 times a night, I decided to stick with it and ordered the NOW-5-HTP and after taking 50mg once a day at bed time the side effects were completely different then the ones I had taking the NATROL brand, I could not get to sleep and I had the reported muscle weakness along with ringing in my ears, Needless to say I will look for something else to help me get a good nights sleep, I was really hoping this would help me as it has for the many people who have reported their satisfaction with it in helping them."
4,Delightful country gospel album,"I am fortunate to have seen Mac McHale perform a few times, and whether gospel or not, his performances are real crowd-pleasers! If you're in southern Maine or Coastal NH, look for his free or fee public performances.My favorite McHale song is ""Over in the Gloryland,"" which I play (remember)in my head some mornings to perk myself up. The title song ""Turn Your Radio On,"" had some odd starts and background singers, but Mac sounds fine. His other CDs that mix secular and Christian songs are fun, too."
2,"NOT gold plated, possible interference problems","Product description said the leads were gold plated, but the were NOT. Even more of a problem, the product description talked about foil shielding to reduce EMI, but when using this cable I get lots of interference from my laptop audio. Other, shorter cables do not have this problem with the laptop. Oddly enough, if I plug in my iPod to this cable I do NOT get the interference, so I can't be 100% sure it's the cable's fault. Perhaps some sort of impedance mismatch? Even that seems like a long shot. the bottom line is this cable may or may not work for you depending on your equipment and/or environment, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it for areas with lots of electronic noise."
4,great projects,"If you are into doing windows in the style of Tiffany you need this book...lots of beautiful patterns which can be enlarged at your local copy center. There are color illustrations of many of the patterns which should help in selecting glass but, as usual, the actual glass selection is up to you. It would be nice if all the glass used was specifically identified (mfgr., cat. no., amount needed, etc.), but hey, then we wouldn't have all the fun (?) of agonizing over the selection."
1,waste of money,"What a waste of money, This is by far the worst Dracula movie ever made. I turned it off and never saw the end. I should request a refund!! I only rated is movie because the computer wouldn't except my comments if I didn't. Therefore, I rate this movie ""NO STAR""."
4,enchanting,"I don't know if our man from Virginia (spehx) heard the same CD I did but I think he completeley missed the boat on this one. The enchanting music on this CD, especially cuts that contain flameco guitar, are tailor made to relax you from a hard day at work. Just grap a cold one, put your feet up, and play this CD; nirvana is sure to follow. My favorite cuts are Sevillia, Rincon de Espana, and gypsy. This CD gets 4 flamenco guitars. peace."
1,Lentek does not support their product,"I have had my Super Bark Free for 3 years. Never really worked the way I hoped but I spent so much on it I keep trying. Well now it doesn't work. Can't turn it off and it doesn't cycle when the dog barks.I called Lentek and the pleasant young man on the phone told me if it was within the warranty period ""1 year"" they would just replace it. I told him I was willing to pay to have it repaired. He said, ""We are just the distributor and don't support repairs of our product. That is the key, ""THEY DO NOT SUPPORT THEIR PRODUCT"""
1,"Either I don't get it, or this is a really, really stupid book","Rave reviews here and I frankly did not expect to read such a boring, inane, pointless book. Page 118 and nothing yet has happened since all the minutiae that occupy Chloe's mind since she got her minion assistant's assistant job to the least popular person in the Issue magazine. This character cannot be SO stupid, I keep repeating aloud. Her ready-for-asylum sister cannot be so neurotic as to write her 35 page-letters debating every single detail of the way she should behave in the workplace in intellectual guerilla terms - and have the author almost report these letters verbatim. And the marvels of the Shoe Cabinet? Oy!!!Page 130, and I ask myself: ""Why am I still reading this?"" I have better things to do with my life. I put the book down.Moved to Nora Ephron and her neck...finally some intelligent good time!P.S. Maybe this is a work of genius and yours truly did not get it at all."
5,"A real ""Thinking"" Book","Inspiration galore, the more you read the more creative you become. It certainly makes you think. I received the book attempting to get another by the author but was completely satisfied with what I received. I would recommend it to anyone trying to make their minds work harder."
5,Yea finally a game I can get into,"I was happy with this game, I remember when it first came out and was happy to find it for my psp."
5,Great new SH for PSP only!,"I'm amazed that Konami decided to do a brand new, PSP only Silent Hill game... hopefully this (and all the cool new titles coming out this month) will do a lot to boost PSP's cachet among gamers.The game itself? SH: Origins has the nest graphics I've seen yet for the system, and all the original music, story and scares you'd expect from SH. I am ecstatic. Buy this now, and hold on tight for Silent Hill 5 for PS3!!!"
3,it is ok,"pretty boring it was not as good as i thought. it is a good scare that part was good but you dont do much in the game, sold it back"
2,Couldn't get into it!,"It seems like I might be a minority here because I did not like this game! In fact, I got bored with it and didn't want to finish. Graphics and sound are very nice for the PSP, I'll give it that. But over all, I never felt too much fear here. Immersion is the most important part of a survival horror game for me, and I simply wasn't immersed here. I also didn't like the combat system. The idea that you get 9 swipes with a weapon before it breaks was lame. Some might say ""well, that adds realism!"" Sure... a scalpel isn't a real weapon, but we are playing a fictional video game. This game's only real addition to the style of play (they really did keep to the traditional Silent Hill formula otherwise, here) is durability of weapons. They overlook realism, however, when you're able to carry a TV, a toaster, 3 broken boards, a tire iron, 3 scalpels, a katana and 4 guns, all while running!"
5,Wasn't Blown Away...But Still The Best Gospel DVD I've Seen,"Well, I finally saw the DVD, and I was impressed. I wasn't blown away as I expected, but I was impressed nonetheless. The best gospel DVD I've ever seen, in terms of innovation and energy. I thought that they could have showed the choir more though, because I only saw them in bits and pieces, and when they did show them it would be for a millisecond. But still, great DVD........Favourite scenes:Alive 1 & 2Children's BreadTaxi Overture/TaxiTodos Juntos (Sheila E. is a MONSTER)Make Me Over (Seeing it live was a whole new experience, as if I heard for the first time again)Get it now if you don't have it, and don't be like the naysayers, nit-picking on every little detail. Just enjoy the DVD for what it is."
2,I've had better Experiences..,"Mark Blanchard is incredibly flexible and strong, and watching him do some positions can be motivating. His voice, however, is not. I can tune out irritations and get past most things, but I found I couldn't get past his voice and emotion. Yoga is a sport best taught in a moderate, soothing, even-toned voice to not interrupt your concentration and meditation. I wished that I could turn off the sound and just follow the tape, but then I wouldn't have had a flowing workout. I have concerns with the opening warm up as it is too strenuous for the average person's lower back and as a devotee to health and fitness, is not a move I would recommend. The repetition of it is likely to strain people's backs and cause injury. Once you get past that, the rest of the tape is a good workout and when you get to the Sun Salute flow, you will be tested and your muscles will scream. I would recommend looking for tapes with Rodney Yee or by Yoga Zone before this one."
2,Excellent Instruction but Horrible Teacher Personality,"As a seasoned yoga teacher, I was impressed by Mark's sequencing and attention to details in the poses. I thought his knowledge and breadth of the material presented was excellent. However, I agree with many of the other reviews posted that this guy has serious narcissistic ego issues. He uses a lot of negative prompts with the class members (words like ""don't,"" ""stop,"" and ""no"") and his tone of voice sounds like an angry Darth Varder disciplining or getting after the class for not being as picture perfect as him. Yoga is supposed to be an egoless place stemming from compassion for yourself and others. He reminded me a lot of the Harry Potter Book 2 character Gilderoy Lockhart. I would rate this video as a 5 star in instruction but a 1 star in incredibly arrogant teacher personality."
1,Bad,"The charger doesn't contain both connectors, it contain only the first connector shown in the picture. Therefore, I can't charge my mobile, I need the second connector to charge my mobile"
5,A discography diggers dream.,"If you're a ""Numanoid"" and want to know every single piece of music Gary ever released, this is your bible on the subject. There is no better collection of information on his discography anywhere else in the world. (It's so in depth you'll probably get depressed realizing how many obscure releases there were and how you have no chance in hell of finding them.) However, if you're looking for personal information on mister Numan, you're better off getting a copy of ""Praying To The Aliens"", his autobiography. You can still buy it from the Numan website cheaper than on Amazon."
4,Hard to find sizes,"Very impress with the shoe. I saw it at a big name department store. They did not have my size. Amazon had it available and delivered earlier then expected.Just an update, I notice the stitch on the shoe is loose and the shoe is ""coming apart""."
1,"find the site, don't waste your money","Although I couldn't find the specific article on the womenshealthletter web site, I did find others by Dr. Nan that stated as recently as February 2007 ""You also need to avoid the aspirin and make sure you're taking at least 400-800 IU of natural vitamin E (d-alpha or mixed tocopherols) and 1,000 mg of fish oils and omega-3 oils (from flax, borage, or primrose oils) each day. They're good for your heart and completely safe (unlike aspirin). Your voice of reason in women's health,Dr. Nan "" so what's up with this article? I'm not curious enough to find out. Apparently someone is just trying to pick up a few bucks, Amazon should pull it."
1,embarrassingly bad,"How the R&D department at Cuisinart managed to convince themselves that this toaster is anything better than a big white doorstop is beyond me. The settings go to 6, but anything more than 2.2 is a guaranteed burn. There is a range of about 2-2.2 where you might get a certain browning, but it'll only be on 1/2 of the toast/bagel. Of the approx. 9"" of length, only about 3"" are hot, and usually scorchingly so. My wife has figured out that bagels come out decently on one side when placed ON the toaster, at a 4 setting. The thing buzzes like I would imagine an air raid alarm would do, when on. Purchased from Sears, where my experience with appliances has been sketchy at best, I will NEVER go back to that store for another."
1,horrible!,"burns toast, bagel setting heats up 3 sides (and seems to change which 3). I have usually had good luck with Cuisinart products, and so am very disappointed."
4,Great for a BIG family!,"We needed a new toaster and because we have 7 people in our family we needed something that would last and toast at least 4 slices. This toaster is wonderful! It's fast, efficient, and sleek enough to fit in a small kitchen. Most 4 slice toasters are bulky and not really intended to stay on a kitchen counter but the Cuisinart Tan-4 Tandem 4 slice toaster fits well in even the smallest of places. I would recommend this toaster to anyone looking for an ""easy on the pocket"" 4 slice toaster."
1,Stopped working in Two Year,We are not heavy toaster users and I expected this higher priced unit to last a lot longer. I would not buy their product again because it performs the same as cheaper competitors.
2,Extremely disappointing,"After only a few months, the words for the settings wore off. Now you can't tell if the button being pushed in means 2 slices or 4. If you get it wrong, the toast in the back slot doesn't toast.The design is awkward with the dials on the front and the level on the side.Despite the numerous settings for bagel, toast, etc., and the number of levels of doneness, we constantly have to re-toast or end up with burned spots."
5,WONDERFUL! A collection of short stories from women of WWII,"This is a great collection of true short stories from women of WWII. Some are funny, some are sad, all bring you a little closer to what life was like 60 years ago. This is a great book to read piece at a time, since each story is independent of one another."
2,thermometer isn't an accurate gauge,"The duck is cute, but we got the ""police officer"" duck (at another store) and it won't stay afloat straight-up; it's weighted to one side and so it falls over. And the thermometer turns white-ish even in warm water so it's hard to gauge if the water is really hot."
2,Water got trapped inside,"I bought this duck because one of the reviewers said there were no holes so it wont get moldy. But just after first use, water got inside of the duck through the rim of the hot button and got trapped in there. I guess the only difference is you wont see the mold grow inside. Also the Amazon price is about $1.50 higher than the retail price at Target. It's a large mark up for such a cheap toy. I'm disappointed at this product."
1,Not accurate!,"Being a first time mom, I tend to try to follow the rules. So when my bath water for baby read too hot on this duck, I made it cooler & cooler til the duck was happy. It seemed cool to me, but I figured I just didn't know a proper temperature. My baby hated her first couple of weeks of baths-- crying, looked cold. When we forgot about the duck & upped the temp a little to what just seemed reasonable, suddenly he crying bath time stopped! Not accurate & others say it let's you make the water TOO hot! Guess its just a bad thermometer. Cute toy though."
5,excellent book on 3G,Excellent book on 3G communications provides good illustrations and descriptions of the technologies. The author Juha Korhonen is from Finland and is expert on mobile communications.
5,Quality,"These seem to be off good quality. I feel much better since I started taking them. Much more energy.but ive also started taking fish oil, d3, green tea and green coffee. So I cant be sure they are what's making me feel great. It should also be stated that I have changed my diet and workout."
3,Test Subject,"The date is 3/29/2012 and the time is 1600. I will be taking this product stacked with Piracetam, and Huperzine A (normal prescribed dosage on bottle); all of which were purchased from Amazon. I am currently studying for several tests and working out about 4 days a week, thus the aforementioned claims in several reviews should be confirmed during this study. I will update each drug individually, but with same results, as there is no way to distinguish efficacy of individual medications that are stacked.Day 1. 3/29/2012Mouth feels drier than normal, but otherwise normal physiological function."
5,I want more of these!,"I bought three of these books already through a school book club. Now I want two more and I can't find them. This is by far the best school memory book I've seen. It goes from preschool years up through the Senior year in high school, all in one book. Since most baby books stop at age 5, I've used this book as a continuation from that. It has an unbelievable amount of room for writing detailed information, inserting pictures and recording birthdays. There's even a place for your kids to sign their name and fill out all their ""favorites"" (friends, class, song, etc.) for each year. I thought this would be a perfect high school graduation gift to my kids, so they could look back and remember all their school days. I've gone nuts trying to find more!"
2,Well I got the battery compartment open...,But I almost had to break it in order to do so. Hopefully it's still water-resistant and won't shock me while I'm in the shower. Kinda ridiculous though!
3,Toolman,"I had problems putting the unit together, does not come as one unit even though shipped on a pallet, there were no assembly instructions. I called twice to the manufacture for instructions, they searched for instructions and faxed on the second call. The instructions weren't updated for the changes from older units , so I worked my way through it. You have to keep going to the parts pictures to put it together. To get the cooler to work you have to plug it in each time, it should have been set up with a switch. The trough for the fluid as the unit is running is lower than the drain hole by 1/4', so the fluid stays in the trough and doesn'tall drain back into the holding tank.On the positive side, It's a good unit for home shop use. I'm happy with the purchase now that it's together."
5,Brothers Four shine in Japan,"This 2cd set is probably the best work ever put out by the Brothers Four. They started out BIG in Japan, and are now still very big in Japan. The sound quality is superb, making you feel entirely surrounded by the distinctive sound of their voices. The beautiful ballads, like ""Seven Dafodils"" and ""500 Miles"" are hypnotic, and the medleys are tremendous. Their talent really comes to a fruition on this recording as their singing and playing of instruments has never been better. Inside is probably the best fan letter any group or artist could want."
1,Too expensive,Buy car power inverter at 10%-15% of the cost of this adapter and use it with battery charger received with camera.
5,True Talent,"Even if you're not a Xiu Xiu fan, you'll think this video is the making of art. Courtney Fathom Sell has done it again! And who can't appreciate the talented artwork of Xavier StValentine! A must see!"
3,THE DARK SIDE OF MONICA,"MINAGE IS AN ALBUM REALLY DARK,DRAMATIC AND ARTISTIC IN EXTREME, I DARE TO AFFIRM THIS ABOUT MINAGE,CAUSE I KNOW NO EVERYBODY CAN UNDESTAND THE PERSPECTIVE OF THIS SINGER... WAS REALLY RISKY TRY TO CHANGE HER OWN SCENT, BUT I LOVE IT."" Sobreviviré""""Siempre Fuíste Mío"" "" If you Leave me Now"" and ""Amando Locamente"" ARE THE BEST OF THIS CD."
1,These shirts are for short and wide people,"Unfortunately for me, I ordered 3 of these shirts in a variety of colors right away, rather than buying one and seeing if I liked it.I don't like these shirts. I bought 3 size large, because all of my other shirts that fit well are size large.They are barely long enough lengthwise, stopping at about my hips. And they are VERY wide, and cut very unflatteringly. It is as though these shirts are made for short wide people, because it BILLOWS on me torso wise, while at the same time being nearly too short to be usefully worn.I certainly won't be buying Russel shirts again."
3,Quality has gone down,"I own several Russell t-shirts that are about 10 years old. They are heavy cotton and even 10 years later...still are holding up well. I got this one today and the cotton is probably 50% of what it used to be. You can almost see through it compared to the old Russell shirts. I think that a Beefy T-shirt is thicker. Disappointing for what they used to be. If you don't mind a thinner cotton shirt, this one is good."
4,SIZE: These sizes run Large (or fat anyway).,"Pros:- Fabric is generally warm and put together nicely.Cons:- Size Large is more like size FAT. I'm 6'2, 180lbs and I *should* have ordered a medium.- Sleeve length seems right, but shoulders and gut are much too wide. Seems this was designed for more rotund individuals."
4,Discontinued,"This product has been discontinued. I was unhappy with the fact that each tube added over $4 in shipping and handling when all tubes came in the same box. But, as I said - there was really no where else to buy it."
2,Why Do They Do Things Like This?,"Some of the best music in the film is missing from this soundtrack. Since the studio already had obtained the rights to the songs for the film, one would think they would take the time to include them on the soundtrack. Like another reviewer, I recommend saving your pennies to obtain the best songs off of i-tunes or other cd's. Don't reward the people who issued this for abridging the soundtrack."
2,highlights from groundhog night,"this cd is nothing but some of the highlights from the double cd groundhog night. it does not say that anywhere on the cover, but buried at the bottom of the liner notes. so if you have groundhog night, skip this cd. if you can't afford groundhog night, this is a good place to start. my second complaint is that the songs are the same songs that are on all the other live groundhog cds. they could of at least took more less common tracks and used them rather than the ""standards""."
1,Track listing is WRONG,"Just purchased this item new from an Amazon seller. Same title, same artwork, same Charly label, but this CD now contains ONLY the first 14 songs, all of which are V-Disc recordings, the same material as you'll find on the Louis Jordan V-Disc release by Collector's Choice. Not the seller's fault. I've contacted Amazon and requested that the update the product page. Proceed with caution."
5,Great For Cleaning Glasses!,"I am always loosing the tiny scrap of micro-fiber cloth I got when getting a new pair of glasses, and couldn't STAND the idea of paying $9 each for more. Decided, at the price, this kind inf micro-fiber was worth the risk...and it paid off! Cleans lenses and glasses wonderfully!"
4,Mmmm candy!,The Japanese are pretty famous for their weird/unique candies. This is no exception. I love fizzy candy and these are pretty good! Though I'm not sure how healthy they are.. But who cares! Candy isn't suppose to be good for you. Which is why we're so attracted to eating candy! lol Did that make sense?
1,I should have checked here first,"I purchased the card from Dell not knowing there was a problem with this card and the Axim. What the other two reviewers have said are true. This card and the Axim do not play well together. I could not format the CF memory, it could not recognize the Access point, and I noticed SanDisk's control panel app ran INCREDIBLY SLOW.Worst part...I couldn't get their software out of memory to remove their program from the Axim. I had to do a hard reset to remove it, which wiped out everything on the system. If you have a Dell and you're thinking you're going to kill 2 birds with 1 stone...stay away! Unless SanDisk figured out their problem, just say No to this card."
2,Short life...,"I bought two of these cards. One for myself and the other as a gift. Just past the 30 day warranty period, they both lost the wireless networking function. The 128MB memory still worked, but that was not the point of getting the cards. Sandisk has no mention of this type of behavior on their limited support site. What can I say? Frustrating!"
3,To basic,"I was not impressed with this video. It was larger woman which made me feel a little better about myself. Hut if you've ever danced before like at a club or bar then you probably know all the moves they teach in this video. I thought it was a little to basic. But I liked that they didn't actually strip on the video as I wasn't looking for porn, and I could get the idea without them removing clothing."
1,Like everyone is saying: it doesn't work,The heater works for all of 10 seconds before shutting down. The fan works fine but the heater is dead on arrival.
2,Dated material,"Doesn't rank up there with Calfo, Fenner, Borneman, Delbeek, Tullock, or Sprung. I learned nothing new."
3,Funny and great!,"This was a perfect compliment to my wedding and allowed us to really customize the topper. The workmanship is a little cheap and the painting nothing special, but it produced the desired effect and allowed us to really show our personalities on our cake."
2,Not ASL!!!,"As a brand new student of ASL who hopes to become an interpreter I was looking for a book that tought ASL in ASL sentence structure - this book does not! It is clearly signed English, so if that is what you are looking for, this book seems quite good. Otherwise, don't buy it!!"
1,Better Books Out There,"As a conversational level signer, I had many problems with this book. The edition I have is too old and some of the signs are no longer relevant. The book does not address the issue of ASL versus Signed English/Pidgin Sign at all. If you want to sign with deaf people, this book does not give you the knowledge you need. If you just want to learn new vocabulary there are better books out there. The book lacks advice on how to fingerspell well.The book wasn't ""bad"" or ""awful."" It just had too many drawbacks in today's world where there are so many other options for learningsign language. I wouldn't advise you to purchase this one."
2,Sure it's a good book...,"for learning Signed English. This book is not American Sign Language. I wasn't aware of that when I purchased it, but after taking ASL classes, I quickly became disappointed with this book. It is Signed English, which is very different from ASL. If you want to learn Signed English, that's great, but this is not a good book for learning American Sign Language. They are 2 different languages."
3,Starts off interesting; then interest wanes,"I bought this book at a resale store for 75 cents. I am interested in stories like this. The first part of the book describing the flight and its subsequent crash was quite interesting - very readable.However, I expected more stories about the ghosts of Repo and Loft than what I read. Yes, there were a handful of ghost encounters related by various flight crews but there did not seem to be enough of these to fill the book.Interspersed with the ghost encounters were topics around mediums; information on ghosts and their relationship to the Bible; Fuller's stories about earlier research he was doing; and so forth which, I felt, detracted from the interest of the book."
2,Danielle Steel Wrote This?,"It's hard to believe that Danielle Steel wrote this novel, but I guess first novels can be that way. The storyline is so boring, and you don't connect with the characters like with her other novels. The sotry reads like it was written by a teenager and suspends believe in any of the plot. If this would have been the first book I read by Steel, I wouldn't have bothered reading any of her others---that's how bad this novel was. Skip it!"
2,Danielle Steel book,photo showed the book with a jacket. The book arrived without the jacket.The jacket is important to a collector.
2,Typical Danielle Steel material,"I was in dire need of reading material and borrowed the book from my mother. I hadn't read a Danielle Steel book in years and now I remember why. There comes a time when an author should realize that the ""gift"" is gone. Retirement is better than totally discrediting yourself. Shame on the publishers for even printing this"
1,What a waste of time and paper,"This was the dopiest book I have ever read. First of all Gillian is a woman who thinks with her libido. This guy she falls in love with is a waste of space. Yet, she willingly gives up herself for this childish piece of work. Now, I know many women do this, but do we really have to read about it?Danielle Steele has turned into a wonderful writer, but you'd never know it by reading this. All I can think is publishers had pretty low standards back in 1973, or she knew someone. I'd stick to her later works. This book, ""Going Home"", isn't worth the paper it's printed on."
3,Very cute but snug,"I absolutely loved the style of these - just what I was looking for to wear with jeans or capris. They look very cute.They are snug in the straps. And they are made of wood, so are very hard on the sole. I would put a cushion at the very bottom, but that would make them even more snug.Overall, I do like them for occasional wear, but not all-day events. Very cute and great for the price."
4,Good Score,"Has all the music from the movie, I have about eight favorite songs out of the 21 tracks but there all good if you like Doom a lot."
5,Fun for All!!,"Although I'm not a comic book fanatic, this book was recommended by a friend so I checked it out. It's amazing! The variety and originality in each story is incredible, and I found myself enjoying each one in a different way. The art is also fantastic, and I recommend that everyone should pick this one up. Definitely a must have!"
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun.....","Ok, this game was overall fun. There are however moments that just make you want to slap whoever designed it. When you are in this school...(for most of the whole game)...it is huge, and you are walking everywhere. Sometimes when there arises a puzzle, you have to walk all over the school to find the answer. Then, when you think your almost there, you are on the top layer of the school. This is better, because now you can just teleport everywhere where as you couldn't do that before. But you are still trying to figure out which teleport to take. Yes, the acting is lacking, but who really cares. I did love the scenery with the waterfalls and such. Very beautiful, and the puzzles were good too. Some of them seemingly impossible to solve, and some very easy. I am a person who loves to try and figure out things, and if you don't use any cheats or help, this should take you a while to get through. I enjoyed it...really, I did. Just make sure you have alot of time to play it!!"
3,Frustrating Insole,"I ordered these shoes to wear for aqua-therapy that I must attend three times a week. The shoes are very comfortable and look nice. I didn't check the sizing so they are a little big but that is my fault. Apparently they run slightly large. My only complaint is the insole. The very first time I wore these in the water the insole curled under my toes and it was very uncomfortable trying to keep them where they belong while doing the therapeutic exercises I needed to be focusing on. It was definitely a distraction. Walking on the treadmill in the water was also very difficult because the insoles kept slipping. I will likely go back to wearing my old water shoes for this reason. If I could figure out a way to keep the insoles in place, this would be the perfect water shoe for what I need."
4,awesome,"the water shoe works great! i used it for a competition, it was snugly and comfortable. it is worth the purchase"
3,Disappointed,"These work great initially but the liner comes out and that is a pain. Does not give support if you need that with foot or back problems but ok was not scuffing your toes. Next time I will buy a tennis shoe type water shoe. Sizing could be an issue; I wear mostly a size 7, shoe but after reading reviews ordered the 8 and it fit fine. Just be sure you are ordering the type of shoe you really want."
4,GREAT FOR NON-SLIP!,"These water shoes were perfect for cave tubing. They have a non-slippery surface and don't hold water like some shoes may. There are some complaints about the insole coming out and they do slightly do that, but it's an easy fix."
5,Speedo Water Shoes,"These shoes fit perfectly, and are easy to slip on; not so easy that they would fall offThey' are perfect for my pool exercise classes!"
1,Not good,"Well, the inner soles crawl up and curl around your toes.I tried to fix it, but no good.Don't buy them"
2,Water Shoes disappointing,"Within the first week, the liner inside the shoe fell out. I expected better quality from this brand name product."
2,so so,pretty flimsy for a water shoe - certainly would not want to stub your toe on coral. ok for walking on the beach but not for more adventurous endeavors... prob get eaten up real quick
5,Exciting Book!,"I buy lots of books and usually don't feel the urge to write a review, but this book is so great I had to share. Besides being beautifully done, with excellent illustrations and pictures, it's easy to read and understand. I couldn't put it down and can't wait to start my first doll. It's exciting and inspirational. You can't go wrong with this book, I highly recommend it."
1,Did not receive book ordered,"Book was ordered and paid for on April 5,2009 from vendor Patti Medaris Culea. Now it is May 9th, 2009 and I have not received the book. I contacted the seller on May 7th, 2009 and have as yet not heard from Ms. Culea as to the status of my book. My credit card was charged. Now I have to resolve this instead of enjoying my new book.Unhappy customer,Ms. R. Snyder"
4,The Lady Vanishes...a sad hypocrisy,"The DVD is grainy, with an out-of-sync audio track, but the story is fine, Bruce Dern does a great job. And where is Pam Grier? Every trace of her has been excised from the original movie; her name is not on the dvd box...and a 95 min loses 10 minutes to what purpose? No reviews have suggested the reason for the release of only the sliced and diced version. What had been an R rated film is now...? A real disappointment to me, having seen the movie in the theaters at the time of its release. For a movie that takes issue with commercialism, the willingness to make a ""safe"" version without interracial romantic plot points, is sad. Pathetic on several levels."
2,Where is Pam Grier and why is she gone?,"I have been a distance runner for over 20 years, and have run countless marathons and other races, so I enjoy a good running movie. When I first saw this movie, 20 years ago, I thought it was great. It focused not only on the training and the sacrifices we go through to achieve our goals, but on how it affects other aspects of our lives. It takes a toll on the close relationships we have. It's hard for the ones we love to understand the sacrifices we make for that elusive mistress, the marathon. This movie in its original form explored those issues. What they have now is closer to a documentary, than trying to get to the Soul of running. Why did they have to screw up a good movie. Besides, Pam Grier is beautiful in the original version. Find an old VHS copy with Pam Grier and see the difference."
4,I wanted something different and this delivered,"I enjoyed the acting in this very interesting film. It was refreshing to view a film untainted by the worn out formula of graphic sex, violence, explosions and vulgarity. Good acting and lots of options with subtitles and dubbing. If you're not in the mood for this radical departure, you may not like it. But I was hungry for a change of pace and this delivered nicely. I got so absorbed in the acting I felt like I was in the presence of the actors. There are a couple very powerful moments in the film where the acting between the king and the queen is a real jaw-dropper. For me, just those well-acted scenes were worth the cost."
1,broken trays,I would wonder if they are all boroken when they get to the distination.If they replace the trays it would be nice but i wouldn't recommend plastic.
5,Wonderful sequel!!,"Fractal Mode is a really great sequel to Virtual Mode. A new anchor in a new reality that is amazing. A fractal reality, where a mathematical equation become every single part of the earth, with rad and filaments, wondrous shapes of ferns, sea horses,bugs, etc... comprise this new reality.This is Piers's imagination at its best! Colene and Darius continue their adventure with Sequiro, Provos and new anchor Nona.If you like Virtual Mode, you will love Fractal Mode. And don't forget to read Chaos and DoOon ;-)"
4,Two Words...,Patrick Magee. He comes in right at the very end of the film. There. You see him? Say hello to Mr. Magee. Hello Mr. Magee.
4,Loses a star for the DVD features,"This is a 5 star film across the board: terse screenplay, stunning performances, haunting John Barry score, wonderfully understated cinematography, but the transfer was terrible. The audio transfer is the worst. The television had to be turned way up and, as the other reviewer said, then certain parts would be very shrill and make the set vibrate. The little hairs and other things that appear when transferring old film negatives don't bother me as much as poor audio. I really wanted to hear commentary from anyone on this disc, I am also a big fan of subtitles (I don't know why). All that being said, I still have to give it 4 stars. This movie is just that good. I found myself literally on the edge of my seat at times, that's a very rare and wonderful thing.M"
3,"Confused, But Possibly Helpful","Looking at the trees, _Time Management for Unmanageable People_ was a jargon-laden, philosophically confused waste of time. But the forest wasn't so bad. The basic premise, that time management advice is too often useless and even harmful when applied to creatively disorganized people, seems sound. The book primarily functions as an alternative guide to time management for the creatively disorganized, discussing both why traditional techniques fail and suggesting some alternative methods. Unfortunately, both the theory and practice of the book tended to be shallow at best. So the primary virtue of this book certainly lies in its basic approach to the subject of time management: individual people need to find methods of time management that suit their unique strengths and help them overcome their weaknesses."
1,Not recommended,"This book was not helpful. There is little here that has not been better presented elsewhere. While I liked the first chapter about different styles of time management, knowing this information did little to help me with my own time management issues. Some suggestions even seem silly-such as changing your time management system to suit your mood. Alan Lakein's ""How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life"" is still the most valuable book on time management out there."
1,Buy Jack Hamm's book instead,"Since I had found Bammes' ""The Artist's Guide to Human Anatomy"" helpful, I ordered his animal anatomy book without ever having seen it. What a mistake. There were a few well done, loose, expressive drawings, but most of the drawings that purported to be realistic were badly drawn. I'm not talking about niceties such as line quality, or rendering of surface details either. There were gross perspective and proportional errors in far too many of the author's drawings! Buy Hamm's ""How to Draw Animals"" instead. It may have a dated look, but the information is still first rate, and the drawings are accurate."
3,Animal Drawings,"I loved this author's Life Drawings book. Animal Anatomy is Ok...not as good as his Life Drawing book, but just my opinion"
1,Should be Zero Stars,This product is a prototype. $25.00 would be a better price.1. The Device does not work. It keeps timing out when searching for radio stations2. No Technical support. No emails returned and online Support Chat seems to be offline3. Live 365 will not work4. The wrist strap will not thread into the device5. When the station search was working you have to know what city the station is in when looking in a foreign country.Do yourself a favor and don't purchase
5,A must read for any Garland fan,"This book, which accompanies the box set (Vol 1) of Judy's TV series, is an invaluable resource for any serious Judy Garland fan. The writing is clear and concise, the approach is objective (but with great empathy for Judy), and the research conducted by the author is impressive. Until this book was written, the only documented history of this landmark TV show was the book written by Mel Torme, which was mean-spirited and by no means a balanced account of what really went on. Congratulations and much gratitude to Mr. Sanders for a very memorable read."
3,"average figs, expected more compared to in-store","No issues with fulfilling the order, but I wouldn't order dried figs online from ANYBODY again. This brand was the best and freshest and softest I ever had when I bought it at my local store, not all dried out and hard like all others.But my store has had trouble getting them, so I thought I would try online.These arrived in ""normal"" condition - like you can always find in the storein any brand - not soft and extra-delicious.So it's not the brand that determines how good and fresh they are,it's how long they've been sitting around."
5,Grierson,"Al Grierson's music is raw, from the heart, ""honest music"". Somewhat along the lines of Harry Chapin. Tragic that this life was cut short. The vendor was absolutely top rate."
3,It's ok,Not a great movie. In my opinion the performances didn't convince me (actually I was kind of disappointed with Laurel Holloman) and I couldn't trully get involved with the characters or the story. And to be honest found it kind of boring.Nicole Ari Parker is great though.
5,This a truly great movie to watch,This was the first movie that I ever saw that was a realistic look about teenage lesbians.
1,Don't bother with this one,I stopped after the first 10 minutes or so because the movement in this game was so horrible. And frankly it was just boring!
2,Good?,"The book arrived on the end of the expected period of arrival. It was also in an ""Ok"" condition, not really good, because the book was already worn out with lots of handwritten notes on the margin. Did not look like second hand, rather more of 3rd hand book. Nevertheless it served the purpose."
4,A talent whose music draws me in,"Keiko Matsui is a major player in contemporary pop/jazz/new age. She has a funky and lyrical approach that always surprises, especially in her later all-instrumental albums. She is tender, cheeky and deep."
4,no more raccoon eyes,"It really stays on: no smudging or flaking. Kind of scary when you do take it off because it looks like your eyelashes have fallen off. It definitely needs primer before application! I did not originally purchase the primer and was disappointed with the results (with primer it is great). The mascara does not build up on lashes, so it won't thicken them--need primer. I have used ""Too Faced"" version of this mascara. It did not need primer and would build on lashes, however, the product dried out very quickly and had to be thrown away too soon to make it worth the money. Taking two steps (primer plus mascara) takes a little longer, but the results are worth it!"
3,A Chinese soap opera,"This is a domestic drama of the 1920s when China was fought over by warlords and Shanghai was a city ruled by fat-cat Western and Japanese interests and Chinese criminals. The chaos and split-personality of China at the time is captured by the film.What you can say about this movie is that it was not directed by Zhang Yimou who did (if I'm not mistaken) Raise the Red Lantern and Ju Dou which were excellent movies. ""Temptress Moon"" is similar to Zhang's work. But Gong Li, the lead actress, is less sensual than usual, the story is convoluted and complicated, and the plot strains credibility.The lead male character, Zhong, is a Chinese Tom Cruise. The women all love him, despite the fact that he's a louse. He suffers horribly because they suffer because of their love for him. Nobody suffers as much as Gong Li. The photography is gorgeous. The movie is worth seeing and is intriguing -- but it's not good enough to see several times to puzzle out what is going on.Smallchief"
3,Not like its big brother,"I have a couple of the larger model and this knife is very small compared to them. I have medium size hands and it was hard for me to open this knife. The blade is sharp like the larger version but it comes out slower than the large version. The clip is extremely tight. I had a really hard time slipping the clip over a jean pocket. I tried to bend it outward to ""loosen"" the clip but it snapped in two!!! The broken clip left a sharp edge but thankfully I was able to use a tiny Torx bit to remove it. Overall, for $20 - there are better options."
2,not a great design!,"I find this knife difficult to open,the safety mechanism is awkward and you have to push against the blade stud at just the right angle to enact the FAST system.It takes me both hands, the design just doesn't work for me.I do like the blade size and shape.I feel it's not a good buy."
3,"OK, but not much fun.","Simply put, this game was OK to play once or twice, but quickly got ""old."" There are just a few challenges (most involve listening to clips), which you end up repeating multiple times to progress. Some of them were beyond my preschooler, so he lost interest. Some educational value - maybe best used in a classroom setting."
3,"a cocktail of heavy rock, melody and grunge","SOG are one of the few heavy rock/stoner rock bands from Canada and they debuted with this fine 6-track CD. This trio listened a lot to zeppelin, sabbath and the beatles. so they definetley don't win a prize in the original department, but what the hell the songs are well performed, the vocals sound good and the production is smoothly done by nick blagona (the tea party). if you like your stoner more heavy/fuzzy/doomy it won't tear you apart. otherwise if you're into more melodic mainstream rock, you maybe would dig this. Next year they'll release a full cd and then we'll talk again."
