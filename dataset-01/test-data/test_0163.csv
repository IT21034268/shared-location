1,"Light flickers, when turned OFF, avoid Hunter fans","I bought this Palermo and 2 Hunter Grand Isle fans at the same time for our 3 bedrooms, none were cheap, all have remotes. This fan's light slightly flickers when turned OFF, so we have to turn off the wall switch too. Hunter doesn't care. Now one of the Grand Isle fans blows light bulbs as fast as you can put them in. Hunter doesn't care. They will be happy to sell me a $65+shipping replacement light control board though. Wait, I thought Hunter Fans have a lifetime warranty? Nope, only the fan motor is covered, silly me.Find something to do when you call them and are put on hold for over a half hour. Yup, just like everyone else says that calls them."
4,Great Value and Design,"It has a transitional design that will blend easily with a modern or traditional decor. The remote control that mounts on the wall plate has all the functions you would ever need like 3 speed, light and reverse flow. The 'no wabble' technology makes for a very smooth and solid function. This fan will spin at full speed and stay rock steady and makes this fan worth the price. You will be satisfied."
2,Somewhat disappointed,Great price but installation instructions are poor. Light globe retainer / trim ring difficult to install. Light output is insufficient for my room.
2,Good till it breaks,"I've had mine for 2 years when the receiver stopped working. I've had this happen with other fans so it was not a big deal, but here is the problem: Spare parts can only be found from hunter for this model, not homedepot or lowes.After a month of struiggling with the fan, getting spare parts and replacement parts from hunter and spending more than it would cost me to get a new fan, the damn thing still does not work. The fan works fine, but the light does not.At this point, I am taking it to the back yard for a good beating and replacing it with a new fan."
4,Can Hardly Go Wrong!,"This was my first in-depth study of the subject and I could hardly put the book down. The history here is absolutely riveting and well-written, and also seemingly well-documented. The only reason I can't give it five stars is the profuse discussion on the possible routes Hannibal took, which is fine in and of itself, but without adequate maps?!! If I were a native or resident of the region and knew all these place names it would be a different story, but as it were there was no payoff in reading these sections carefully without the benefit of placing it in a geographical context. Thus, I inevitably resorted to skimming these sections to get back to the meaningful discussions. As far as the rest of it, though, I give Prevas high praise for a very readable and engrossing account of Hannibal's exploits and the broader context, even if only introductory, of the Punic Wars."
1,Tastes different than it once did,"The last time I bought this it was good tasting. However, this most recent experience was unpleasant. The taste seemed different than before and it upset my stomach. I won't order it again."
4,Traditional heavy metal,"In my opinion this is Krokus very best album. The songs on ""Hardware"" are over all strong, especially ""Easy rocker"", ""She's got everything"" and ""Rock city"" that is similar to AC/DC's ""Overdose"". The vocals are in fact also very Bon Scott-like. At this time Krokus had a more raw sound, but became more polished a few years later. This album should be a real treat to any fan of traditional heavy metal รก la Accept, Saxon, Iron Maiden among others."
5,Simply GREAT!,"this movie was fabulous. Th effects, the storyline, the acting and everything about it. It's definitely worth it. I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of foreign films."
3,Just OK,The canteen works fine but is made of a slightly flimsy hard vinyl. The top is a little tricky to screw back on especially if you're in a hurry. Does fit the pouches fine tho.
3,OK Novel,"I think this was a good read, but not a compelling piece of literature. About a 4 or so would do it. I am glad I read it, and would do so again, but it ain't Lonesome Dove. Kind of reminiscent of Louis L'Amour, but with more than one plot element going on at the same time. Not a bad read."
1,might be good if it worked,"an appallingly bad product that doesn't even fullfil its simple function. This charger produced feedback, depending on the speed of the car, which overpowered the audio from the ipod and caused a shrill whine in my car's speakers. Add to that the ridculously bright 'function' light (read: glowing billboard for DLO's logo) which literally drowed out nightvision on a PM-darkened dashboard. Worse than useless."
3,missing central pieces,"We had received a smaller set of Magz as a gift and it keeps my 8 year old busy building different structures, so I purchased this mega set because she asked for more pieces. There are 3 types of pieces: straight rods; magnetic balls and fixed ""x""s which are used as supports for attachment. This set DOES NOT contain any of those central pieces at all, which severely limits what can be built with it."
3,not what I expected or hoped to get,"Unfortunately for this product, I already have a set of MagnetiX (which are hard to find (or too expensive) because of a recall). My daughter wanted more magnets to add to her set. She was limited by the small quantity of MagnetiX we have. When I saw these Magz, I thought they would be great to add to her collection. I should not have assumed they would be the same quality of toy. The Magnets are weaker, the balls are smaller, the bars are thiner but slightly longer and made of cheaper material, and the toy just doesn't seem to be the same quality. I bought these as a Christmas present. Not sure if I will keep them. I can't test them out on my daughter as I don't want to give the surprise away. She may like them, who knows."
5,One of the best fighting movies,"This movie has everything an action person is looking for, fists, kicking, blood, and mayhem. This is one of the best fighting movies. 5 stars for it"
5,dvd,This item arrived in great timing. My son and my husband love it. There are NO problems with it what so ever. I would definantly recomend it to others.I also haVE recommended Amazon.com to several friends in Mexico.
2,boyka boyka boyka,just like a real mma. this guys is good but i prefer boyka... watch the next movie.. this sucks balls
2,Inexcusable!,I've never come across a textbook with so many mathematical and typographical errors! It was absolutely infuriating! We could never trust what the book gave as a solution to an exercise.If the authors would fix these errors it would be a decent text.
5,Another Clinton book - but well researched,I read the book cover-to-cover the day it arrived. This is probably the best researched book on the Clinton's written to date. It includes notes and sources as well as in index. The book provides background detail on both Hillary and Bill Clinton. I feel that it a balanced and objective view of both them including some ancestral and childhood background and their lives from childhood to the Whitehouse. There are many quotations from both detracters and supporters. This book is well worth reading.
5,An Unexpected Pleasure...,"I liked this book. In fact, I really liked this book. Rather than being gossip column drivel, I found it objective, intelligent and refreshing in both its content and approach. If this (prolific) author is to be discredited on the basis of his link to The National Enquirer, let's not forget that Clinton's own counsel, David Kendall, is also The National Enquirer's lawyer. This detail did not stop Kendall from being chosen as the president's top attorney and in fact, may have worked in his favor, since much of the Clinton presidency has turned out to be a tabloid sideshow. Well done Mr. Oppenheimer, and two thumbs up."
1,Hit Her With Your Worst Shot,"How could anyone publish such an unnecessary book? If this is Mr. Oppenheimer's best weapon to try to bring down Hillary and stifle her bid for the US Senate, he has failed and miserably so. His approach is cunning yet his execution falls flat. This book serves only to confirm what we all already know--that Mrs. Clinton will win the election come November."
1,This book is truly not something to put in a young woman's hands without guidance.,"If you believe that men are not capable of being held responsible for their actions - then you might like this book.If you believe that if a man/boy is only ungentlemanly to a young lady it's because of the young lady's poor actions - then you might like this book.If you want your daughter to think that boys have no ability to control their minds or emotions and need a female to keep them in check - then you might like this book. As for me and my daughter, we plan to fling this antiquated (and that's the least of it's flaws) drivel in the wastebasket."
1,You have Got to be kidding!,"I am outraged that anyone would publish such an apparent conglomeration of trash. Even at it's worst, in this politial climate, no government agency would allow the claims made by this so called author to happen. Sure there is a grain of truth, but that is followed by a thousand pounds of manure. Furthemore, dispite all the recommendations made and all the investgations, not one government report confirmed that any of the tageting was racially motivated. The author failed to mention that many of the people doing the job that she attacked are minorities. I don't think after all these years of struggle they like being refered to as working in ""Fort Negros"". I think that she is just looking to make a quick buck from a very sensitive topic. I for one will never buy another book with her name on it. Nor will I ever buy a book from a publishing company that will obviously print such unsubstantiated muck."
2,Not the movie soundrack I remembered,"I expected the movie soundtrack with songs from the 80s and was disappointed. Maybe I'm remembering wrong, but this has a couple of good tracks from the Ghostbusters hit and the rest is similar style but not as compelling."
2,My Mistake,"My wife and I recently saw two different stage productions of Music Man by Meridith Wilson. This made my wife eager to have the recording of Wilson's Chicken Fat, by Robert Preston, she used with her first grade classes in the sixties. We thought this was it, but it is not. This one does not have the wonderful energy of Robert Preston's original recording."
1,Beware this is not the original soundtrack with Robert Preston!,"This is a nice souding, well-done version of the Baby-Boomer era original version. It lacks the energy and charm of the original, which was done by one and only Robert Preston. Don't be fooled by seeing composer Meridith Wilson's name on the label.It is the same song; however, it is not sung by the singer of the well-known and best loved classic by Robert Preston. Not worth the money, if you ask me. Buy the orginal track."
2,Are we talking about the same album???,"I'm a HUGE Helloween fan, and I've always liked Roland's playing and songwriting. I bought this album based on these reviews, even though I never liked the singer's voice when he was with Malmsteen...now I remember why. This guy has taken what would have been a great metal album and turned it into something very cheesy....he sounds like he wants to be the singer for Journey. If that's the type of sound you like then I guess you'll like this album, but I think his voice ruins the album. Someone wrote that he's the best singer of his genre??? Uhh...ever hear of Bruce Dickinson? Rob Halford? Michael Kiske? Even Don Dokken has a much better metal voice. I feel bad giving a negative review because I like Roland and wish him success, but he needs a new singer."
3,enjoyable but criminally incomplete,"Where are ""Hyper-Gamma Spaces,"" ""Lucifer"" and ""Secret Garden,"" 3 of their greatest works? ""In the Lap of the Gods"" would have been welcome, too. This was a good start, but I'm going to re-burn it with the aforementioned, plus tracks from ""Tales of Mystery and Imagination"" and ""Try Anything Once."""
5,My ears have never been washed so clean...,"Joi is music born in the East where Budda danced in serenity and joy. The sound of this Cd will melt your heart with beats of 'tabula' love. You close your eyes, you stand on the street, every second you live to pray for this kind of music coming. Joi strengthens your mind by its passion in the true Asian Underground style."
2,2 Stars...,"""Buffalo Soldiers"" by Robert O'Connor (Vintage Books; 324 pages) peaked my interest with the title and eye catching book cover. However the story did not hold my attention at all. I think that I could have enjoyed it better had it not been written in second person.I would consider reading this author's next book, but as for this book about drugs and the military...I say scan before you buy."
2,wish I'd passed,"For me, two stars means I wish I hadn't read it.I found Elwood's story uneventful and lacking a measure of believability. The author seems to know little about the military, fighting, drug trafficking, or anything else being discussed. The most important skill missing however is the storytelling.That characters aren't developed and nothing really happens through most of book. Just when the action picks up it's glossed over so quickly that when the book ends it has just added to the frustration."
2,Insulting,I found this book insulting to our servicemen and terribly depressing. Don't waste your time.
2,Mindless entertainment,Totally unbelievable. Junk food for the mind. It was entertaining enough if you take it for what it is. Would make an interesting comic book.
4,Great Jacket for casual use.,"Appears to be well constructed with quality fabric. The lining is soft and warm enough for cool Fall days. The snap closure was one of the features I was looking for in a jacket, as I prefer that to a zipper. The knit cuffs keep the sleeves in place without binding wrists. I consider it a very good buy."
2,Stan and Ollie Deliver a Few Classic Moments,"""The Big Noise"" (1944) does not rank among the best Laurel and Hardy comedies. However, it's not their all-time worst, as many critics have claimed. Despite their age and lack of creative input, Stan and Ollie provide a few classic routines in this wartime escapade. Children will enjoy ""The Big Noise"" more than adults, but the uninitiated should seek out ""The Music Box"" (1932) and ""Way Out West"" (1937)."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book for my classroom library, but I do not display it. I find it to be too race-oriented. I feel uncomfortable putting so much emphasis on black vs. white."
1,Tells half the story,"This film attampts to paint a pretty grim picture of the iraqi resistance, Palestinian suicide bombers, and Saddam Hussein. It's not hard to do that. This video does it with gruesome glee. Sound like fun so far. it isn't. People who see this film should remember one thing. Waiting to be made is a film just as nasty and gruesome. It would feature thousands and thousands of dead Palestinians and Iraqi's who've died as a result of our (US and Israeli) massive air strikes over the past few years. Those images would be just as bloody and nasty. That should be tacked on to the end of this film. The new theme would be ""War. What is it good for?"" Rather than ""America saves the savages from themselves."" I'm no fan of F9/11 because it does the same thing from the other side (though with better skill and entertainment value)."
1,There is no war on Islam,"America are allied with suadi arabia, The most fundementalist and extremist Islam nation in the world. They don't care about Islam Extremists, this DVD is totally irrelevant propeganda."
4,Wrong idea from people on Amazon.,"Sure this DVD may be one sided bias. But what do you expect? It's showing the brutal crimes committed by Saddam's government and how brutal other radical Islamic groups around the world can be.A majority of the footage you'll see on here is from Iraq, while other footage is from Chechnya and the conflict in Israel/Palestine.Dont watch this thinking your going to get a fair and balanced piece, it's just to show you how violent the world can be.I believe this DVD is associated with ogrish.com as well, so check up on that.It's just gore, gore, gore folks. But it left it's mark obviously."
4,Still Using this Book,"This was one of my first knitting books. The patterns are very easy to read and I have made many of the items found here. The baby rolled cuff hat, and baby booties are a staple for gifts now. The felted blanket, as another reviewer states, is too expensive for an animal shelter, but fabulous for a gift for my friend's new cat.I used the sock pattern for a while until I found some others that are written much clearer and easier. I wouldn't use this sock pattern again.Overall, worthwhile and I book I refer to."
2,Jedi Traning Manual,"The pen is okay, but the questions in the manual are ridiculously hard. Definitely for adults who are Star Wars buffs!"
3,meh...,"I picked this one up a few years back cause i was in need of a ska fix and it was handy at the time and only cost 4 bucks factory sealed. cant beat that. Basicaly the love child of the sureptones and the dancehall crashers as far as sound and content. I cant say I was ever overly impressed. There are better bands out there, but One Eighty is still ok. When i bought it, it wasnt a problem but now the music is WAY to preachy. If you like christian music, then i recomend it, but for everyone else, go buy some DHC albums.ill say this, you can get it for $.25, so you cant lose either way"
2,Hmmmm...........,"Right, first of all they are a good band musically, a bit of a dance hall crashers rip-off but there you go. Why 2 stars then? Because they undo all their hard work by ramming religion down our throats in every song. It is preachy and condescending, and it gets really old, really fast. They wouldnt like it if bad religion said 'you are all wrong, god is a myth' in every single chorus of every single song would they?"
4,One Eighty-One of the best new christian SKA bands!!!!,I just got One Eighty for christmas and i think it is so awesome. They are definetly one of the best new SKA bands around. My 2 favorite songs are Vacation and Just Like You. They really stress they idea of prayer and the basic christian values. If you are into SKA i would definetly get this album.
4,this is a good cd,"This is good....it is a good follow up to Bless The Martyr and Kiss the Child.....has some pretty good guitar riffs on this CD...some weird ones but its awesome....""Murderotica"", ""Bayonetwork"", ""Liarsenic"", etc, are good songs on here.......good buy"
1,Was this band ever taught how to play?,"I am a fan of metal, and really hard stuff but when i heard this bad it gave me a headache it sound like they are playing the gutiars with pick axes, my friend reffered them to me and like fool i bought it. Its just unorganized noise. Save yourself the money!! don't buy this."
2,What happened?,"I really loved Norma Jean's first album, Bless The Martyr and Kiss The Child. It was chaotic all the way through, had some post-rock influences, terrific musicianship, and just ruled. So what happened here? When did Norma Jean become a standard metalcore band? I can understand that when a key member leaves, it's hard to replace him or her, but man, they sacrificed a lot.I'll be honest, there are some good songs on here, such as the maniacal ""Bayonetwork"" and ""Murderotica."" But, what ruins the album is the use of whiny singing. It sounds like they want to be more mainstream with this album. It's a lot more polished, there's big anthemic choruses with whiny singing, and it just feels weird. It's a dissapointment to be sure.I hope that they can return to the chaos that was their debut. If not, I might as well give up on Norma Jean."
4,Not bad at all..,"This is going into my daily rotation as of now, but I just know that I'm going to get sick of it sooner or later. Don't get me wrong, it is an amazing CD, but it just doesn't have that certain punch that it needs to make you want to come back for more and more.""Bless The Martyr"" was a CD that was very well known among theChristian hardcore scene and Norma's first album (second if you count Luti-Kriss) and everybody knew it was going to be hard to top. I mean, you don't really hear many albums as good as it, so of course ""O' God, The Aftermath"" isn't going to live up to it.Norma changed their sound, and it wasn't a bad switch at all. Their song structures are a little more complex, but it's not as chaotic as they once used to be. Let me point out that ""Disconecktie"" is probably the best song I've heard in a long while and I suggest everyone check it out. It's ten minutes, but every second is worth it."
1,terrible,this band on cd is terrible and live they are even worse. they are a typical talentless band. don't waste your time with this cd or any others.
3,Botch Cover Band.,"Most people who like Norma Jean tend to enjoy bad metalcore and post-hardcore. But people who enjoy(ed) Botch will probably also enjoy this album. Because Norma Jean just straight ripped off Botch. However, it's still an enjoyable album. You know what, you should all go buy a Botch album instead. We Are The Romans and An Anthology of Dead Ends are both really solid."
1,Metalcore,"sucks. If you like this album you are a poser. That means you think cradle of filth is black metal and slipknot is death metal. One guy I know that listens to norma jean, as i lay dying, and unearth, called me emo for listening to acid bath. How stupid can you be? You posers need to wise up and listen to real metal, such as Morbid Angel, Darkthrone, Amon Amarth, OLD Sepultura, and Dissection."
4,An Objective Review,"Norma Jean's epic ""Bless the Martyr and Kiss the Child"" nearly floored me. It's by far my favorite album of this genre. That being said, i was extremely hesitant in even picking up the new album out of fear of dissapointment...but my hopes were still high. So did Norma Jean's ""O' God, the Aftermath"" live up to my high hopes? No.But...This is still quite an album. The album insanely brutal, and maintains its brutality even without the breakdowns that have become a hardcore cliche. The guitar work is absolutely insane, and people tend to overlook its intricacy. Honestly, can you play it? I didn't think so. You can't tell me a group isn't hardcore/metalcore/(fill in the blank)core just because they don't rely on breakdowns to appear ""heavy"". Furthermore, the production value is jaw-dropping, the lyrics are great and the new vocalist doesn't dissapoint.So although this isn't the Norma Jean of old...it still blows it's competition out of the water in just about every category."
1,Book written by condemned pedophile,"As the previous reviewer points out, Roger Took is a convicted pedophile. See Spectator article (although be warned, it is hard to stomach the details of his atrocious activities). Amazon should withdraw this book from sale. I gave the book one star because this system doesn't allow you to give no stars."
3,This card cost me less than $20!,"I cannot believe the price listing for this card. $70? Really?? You're out of you're freaking minds, Action Packaged, INC!I bought it at Fries back in 2005 for less than $20 and even then it was a few years old.. Sound was pretty good. Did have problems with the rear jack cutting out after a while. Anyway, this card is badly out of date. The company is out of business. I think the driver to search for if you're running any kind of MODERN operating system would be the c-media PCI driver and you might have some luck there. Does work on Windows 7 x64 and I've had this card for over 4 years and am using it for emergencies only."
3,It's a speaker,"Yeah at this point I feel like I'm reviewing just to review. I'm just saying that if you're buying this you most likely know what it is and how it's going to sound. I used it to replaced a blown 10"" on a Ampeg SVT810 type set up. It worked and sounded like the others and hasn't blown under mass wattage. I would recommend."
3,What do you expect?,"I think I am the only one here who actually likes this film. Yes, it is crap. But, like with so many horror films, it is artful crap. Bad movies are sometimes better than mainstream flicks. I really liked it. If you have the same mindset as me (looking to be entertained, not enthralled) then you may enjoy this."
1,This is NOT the Phil Spector album as pictured,"This is an old rehash of the earliest Ronettes music originally released on Colpix records very early 1960's. The picture of the 1964 album, WITH THE LISTING OF THE BIG HITS ON THE COVER IN VIEW; was so misleading I ordered it and have to return it now. Amazon obviously was mislead in the same way as I, in that NOW they (EMI) calls it The Ronettes ""featuring Veronica""! Presenting The Fabulous Ronettes was Spectors 64 release, redone in 1967 by arrangement with Philles Records for the 1st time in STEREO and a magnificent job it was! I had the original LP. Stereo is on the picture here too. Hope they will get this straight; don't be mislead to buy based on the cover! They are not yet even listing the titles as they do on all CD's. Only in the front cover photo are they seen, and NONE of these are on the CD,Walt Schultz"
5,more for less,"lost my nikon charger, so i took a chance on this after reading the other reviews. folks, if you get the ma-18, you're paying 3x as much just for the name. this one is better than nikon charger, as well as cheaper -- even with expedited shipping (needed it quick), i still paid far less.so far, works great. charge time appears to be considerably faster than the nikon version, which probably means the batteries will run out faster too. other improvements include an integrated worldwide voltage switcher, a fold-in plug, a snugger cradle for the battery, and a car cigarette lighter plug-in. also no cord or big transformer, so easier to travel with. get two and charge two batteries at the same time, which apparently the more expensive nikon double charger doesn't do..."
3,"Good, but needs to be updated","This is a good little dictionary listing essential vocabulary, but it needs to be revised from its original 1954 vocabulary. A lot of words have changed in the Korean language since then, and a native Korean I showed the dictionary to said many of the words are only ones his grandparents would use. Use with caution."
4,Escribiremos con agua para perdurar,"He leรญdo con sumo gusto el poemario de Guillermo Lรณpez Borges, que me ha dejado gratamente impresionado por la realidad tan vital y tan รญntima que contiene, con unas imรกgenes perfectamente dibujadas de su entorno, en un perfecto ensamblaje de su creaciรณn en luces y sombras, en tonalidades que nos muestran lo efรญmero y lo inalterable, lo accidental y lo trascendente, la pureza y el instinto.Un libro para releer muchas veces, para redescubrir al poeta cada vez."
2,Errors in the recipes,"This book can be a useful reference when cooking for your dosha, and some of the recipes are pretty good. There are however several recipes with rather extreme errors - not enough liquid or too much, for example - so that it can be frustrating to cook from this book. Whenever I try a recipe I have a pencil handy so if something is wrong with the recipe I can make a note of it so that I either know how to correct it next time or stay away from that recipe. These recipes can not have been properly tested before the book was published. I would advise less experienced cooks to stay away from the book because the number of errors in recipes will make it very frustrating to use."
3,Maybe 3 1/2,"I was a tad disappointed with this book. For me, the beginning dragged a bit. I enjoy the writing of Hickman, and the concept of 3 parallel worlds is interesting enough. But something was missing, it didn't hold my interest like it should have. As the stories of Galen the human smith, Dwynwyn the fairy seeker, and Mimic the goblin engineer unfolded and started coming together toward the end, things were a little more interesting. I found Galen to be the most interesting of the characters, which is good since he seems to be the focal point of the tale. Mimic was the least interesting, and seemed to serve as comic relief. If the next installment starts the way this one ends, then I can recommend the series. If not, then there are much better things to read out there."
2,"Good plotting and world-building, but overwritten","I've enjoyed many of the books I've read where Tracy Hickman has collaborated with Margaret Weis. So I was really eager to read the first book in the Bronze Canticles when it first came out in hardcover. When I finally got to reading it, even though I really liked the world, I found his writing style to be way too clunky and overwritten.A couple examples of what I mean. He says, ""Bertika's hair was a brown nimbus..."" which I find to be a bit too odd of a description. When describing a window, he finishes by talking about the world ""beyond its glazing."" This is just in the first few pages. Personally, I find that kind of writing difficult to wade through, and a little pretentious, as if the authors are trying to show just how many words they know.I'll be looking forward to other things Tracy Hickman and his wife are involved in, but I just can't recommend this book due to the difficult to slog through writing."
2,Expected better,"Having read the Dragonlance series, I told myself that the second half of the book would hold more promise as a way to get through the slow first half, which I believed was perhaps necessary as groundwork.The gnome world was, in my opinion, unnecessary. The switching of worlds was at times rather tedious to read, especially the gnome world, which I skipped over almost entirely at the second half of the book, without missing much.The ending was rather ridiculous. Sure, it's fantasy, but then there should also be some rationalisation in fantasy too. Certain things at the finale occurred without a clear explanation, although the reader can link the events together and explain what causes what. However, why certain things are that way aren't explained at all.In short, I felt short-changed and there was a feeling of relief after finishing the book."
5,handy book,I bought one copy of this book for myself and one for my Mom. We both like it and think that it will be a handy book to have around.
5,Get Pumped for Ski Season!,"This is one of Warren Miller's best. It's a great compilation of fifty years of videos with one of the best sound tracks I've ever heard. Five minutes into this, you'll be waxing your skis!!"
5,"Awesome skiing, as usual!","As usual, from the ski movie master Warren Miller, a great skiing movie, with lots of incredible scenes and acrobatics. It just gets you ready fo the ski season and shows those who don't ski how awesome this sport can be. Great fun overall."
4,Only mising one thing,I am pleased with my purchase but the fabric used to make the jersey is not the same as regular football jerseys.
4,Solid,"No complaints about this little machine. I haven't used it much, but the sound has been clear. I've used the supplied headphones on other devices and they seemed pretty clear. I found the 90-minute auto-off to be a double edged sword, listening to sports or NPR on the weekend: saves the battery, but might cut out at a crucial play.Another thing you might not think of: it's easier to find a white device than a black one when you've tossed it into a laptop or gym bag."
2,Better than nothing?,"As the old saying goes ""Jack of all trades - Master of none"". This manual tries to cover five different GM models and as a result does none of them well. While attempting to diagnose a fuel feed problem in my 1994 Grand Am I found several errors in the documentation. The manual will cover one type of system in a particular year group and gives you the infamous... other models similar. So, while it's better than stumbling around in the dark I can't recommend spending $22 for it."
3,A Good Read (if you enjoy descriptions of all-out warfare).,"I picked up the 2003 paperback edition of this novel. The style is simple; the action is brutal; and the results are somewhat predictable.That being said, It's a pretty good read for an action novel set in a period of history which preceeds and in a way provokes the descent into that rather dismal period of European history which we identify as 'The Dark Ages'."
3,Very good for a first book in the field,"Presents clearly the problems and the method. The introductory part was helpful in understanding the ICA theoretical model although more detail on kurtosis description would have been beneficial. I liked the infomax algorithm and the way it was presented. On the down side: some minor erroneus explanations found. I have the feeling that ICA is more than just infomax approach and that the title ""Independent Component Analysis - an Infomax Approach"" would have been more appropiate. On the application section, very good presentation of the signal separation but very succint explanation on natural images for example. Being the first book I see in the field, I think, a thorough presentation would have been helpful."
5,They have done it again!!,This new album is up to their usual high standards. I enjoyed the different songs. The album reminds us of all the immigrants that passed through Ellis Island and the great courage it took to leave their homes to start a new life.
1,not good,"I really have tried to like ""The Irish Tenors"" and I just can't. Their style of singing Irish songs with a hugs orchestra that sometimes drowns out their singing just leaves me cold. Their style just isn't the authentic bouncy fun Irish style with Irish instruments.This particular album tries. It really does. But the courting set with ""Courtin in the Kitchen"" and ""I'll Tell Me Ma"" falls short of an authentic Irish rendition. The Clancy Brothers do these types of songs so much better.Maybe if they'd try to do their concerts with less full dress style, I'd like it better. White tie and tails and a huge orchestra just doesn't say ""Irish Music"" to me."
5,Phenominal / Glorious / Joyful,"I must have been the buyer of the first copy of this CD,and then I got the video and the tape. Now I'm searching for the DVD. It is still not available in my area, and I'm still waiting for it.From the first moment I heard this CD I knew it was their finest effort. The voices are just glorious ( as usual ) and they are a joy to listen to. Anthony's LOVE THEE DEAREST, & MACUSHLA are just examples of the magic of his voice. Finbar's FORTY SHADES OF GREEN & SLIEVENAMON are just two of his beautiful songs.And then there is Ronan Tynan !!!!! Who would not enjoy the passionate emotions of THE GREEN FIELDS OF FRANCE (WILLY MCBRIDE) & MY WILD IRISH ROSE. I have the tape, video and CDof this concert, and will have the DVD as soon as it's on the market. You will be glad you did, because those voices will take you out of this world and into one of pure listening joy.Again, the Tenor's #1 Fan,,,,,Joan Way"
5,Interesting Take on Racism and Jackie Robinson,"This book doesn't sugarcoat what Jackie Robinson experienced as an African-American player in Baseball. It is an interesting story about a white bat boy who may have his own racist tendencies too. He can't help that he admires and likes Jackie Robinson, but doesn't shine Jackie's shoes like he does the white players and watches the white players mistreat Jackie often. It isn't unsuitable for children but the story does hit home what Jackie may have experienced. I read a book on Hank Aaron yesterday and this book is a good companion to yesterday's story. Great for Black History Month or Baseball season."
3,Predictable,"I found this book to be very predictable, with the murderer obvious from the get-go. I also thought the romance between Charlie and Cole could've been written better...it seemed to come way too fast and out of nowhere, without any of the buildup usually found in these types of books."
3,Worth reading,"I will probably follow the advice on teaching math. He makes some very compelling points about the value of using dots vs. traditional symbols for numbers. It makes sense to me that early training of this type could enhance math ability. The general philosophy is also logical and appealing - babies are programmed to learn. This is what they want and what they enjoy. I look forward to fulfilling this need, encouraging curiosity, and instilling a love of learning.But...I can't imagine that *ANY* parent's time is best spent preparing some of the materials described. It seems utterly ridiculous to me. After all, children learn more from watching what you do than from listening to what you say, and I don't think an obsessive parent who spends half their time making flash cards is the best role model. Better to be a good example of a fulfilled person with adult interests."
2,Whatever happened to them?,"Ya, I know...you saw them years ago on Spike Lee's Acapella TV special and were wowed by their version of Zombie Jamoree. I was, too! When I saw that a DVD and soundtrack CD of one of their concerts was available I was thrilled and ordered both. The CD arrived very quickly and I rushed to put it on. I was shortly bored and wishing it would get through so that I could put on a real a capella group like The Persuasions or the Golden Gate Quartet or the Belmonts. Gone was the excitement and vitality of their earlier music and they did not even sing a capella anymore! They now incororate instruments and sound like bubblegum rock. I rushed to my computer and canceled my DVD order and looked for my old soundtrack of the Spike Lee program. Not all changes are for the better."
1,Mr. Keane - What planet have you been on?,"Skip this insulting piece of garbage. I almost couldn't believe what I was reading! At one point Keane seems to imply that Havel's five years as a political prisoner, was nothing more than a planned political move to further his career. Mr. Keane definitely is not a historian, or for that matter, a good writer. What a pity that the book has even received so much publicity. A pure unadulterated insult to one of the greatest figures of our time. Shame on you Keane. Attacking this courageous leader for smoking and drinking habits. I wonder if Keane might have looked for a beer and cigarette after 5 years in a communist prison. Lastly, he criticizes Havel as a writer. Wow, this guy has some really big stones! He writes a piece of junk and in it criticizes one of the most creative and courageous voices of our time. This website only lets you rate from 1 star up, otherwise I would have given it no stars. A waste of time and paper."
5,One of 1980s R&B's most innovative and influential figures' most accomplished album.,"This 1984 release was Kashif's all-time finest, most accomplished and innovative album. Although he specialized in both grinding (yet elegant) funk and sultry romantic ballads, Kashif was more than willing to experiment with other musical influences (case in point: both the ultra-smooth title track and the uptempo funk joints ""I've Been Missing You"" and the instrumental ""Call Me Tonight"" feature very jazzy chords).The album's big hits were the heavy-duty funk workout ""Baby Don't Break Your Baby's Heart"" and the Quiet Storm gem ""Are You The Woman?"" (with the latter being one of Kashif's most emotional and heart-rending ballads) but the title track is (for my taste) the best track here. Leaving its high price aside, this CD is really a must-have for any serious fan of 1980s R&B and the best news is that Sony BMG Japan did (as always) an EXCELLENT remastering job."
5,Nostalgic Britain,"After the hit-and-miss watching of this series on PBS, it is great to finally have all the episodesand in their correct order! How wonderful to see the Britain that was, and no longer is. If youlike animals -- or people -- there's a lot to enjoy here."
3,The Times They are A Changin',"I have seen all the series by borrowing copies from the local libary, but would now like to own the collection. I must say, there is a definite change in feel when the series comes back after an eight year absence with a different wife for James and no explanation as to what has happened to Tristan etc. The specials help fill in the gap but the series definitely is not as wonderful. There was a real chemistry on screen between James and Helen in the original series. One could imagine that they LOVED each other. Therefore, the first three series along with the Specials, would probably be the best selection.Please explain just what episodes are included in the ""entire collection""."
1,Spend you money somewhere else!,"Thank goodness I didn't have to buy this toy for the listed price, I got it a a garage sale almost brand new for 50 cents. I was soo excited with my garage sale find and couldn't wait to get home and let my daughter try it out. It is the most worthless piece of plastic ever. What a dissapointing toy. It is so hard for my 1 and a 1/2 year old to push around. It is even hard for me to push when I am playing with her. It only gets one star from me for the cuteness factor and for the fact that it has an off switch. I do not reccommed this to anyone!"
5,The Power of the Blues,Mick Taylor has been a fovorite guitarist of mine for a while now. But this album put him over the top. It is a great blues album with beatiful and artistic guitar playing. Along with catchy lyrics. This is a must for blues lovers. He is truely one of the greatest guitarists that ever lived!
3,Derwood #2,"While I love the ensemble cast ... I still can not get used to the new ""Derwood."" Elizabeth Montgomery and Agnes Moorehead always make watching any episode of any season worth your while."
2,"Good, but no cigar...","I enjoy this coffee mixed half and half with my preferred non-flavored variety, where it adds a hint of excitement and indulgence to an otherwise ordinary cup, but I have found that I prefer not to drink it alone as I am generally disappointed. It is good, but doesn't have the bold flavor and depth of other chocolate raspberry coffees I have tried. Also, the grind is almost too fine and tends to 'clog' the filter when I brew more than half a pot."
3,"Good, but Zig's has better to offer","This tape is apparently a combination of at least two presentations (Zig's voice tone changes noticeably, and his verbal outlining is interrupted). This is a very short overview of Zig's philosophy, and might be a good introduction to his work. Yet it is too rushed and is presented at the surface level only. As a result, it just does not have the impact we have come to expect from one of the great motivational speakers. I recommend you spend just a little more for the ""Success and Self-Image"" tapes. For those of you who already have those tapes, you do not need to buy this one."
2,Sad it had to end this way,"I bought this because we have two very hairy dogs (bloodhound and lab). I was so excited to vacuum for the first 6 months of owning this ""miracle"" vacuum because it would suck up an anvil as far as I could tell ... but then it lost suction. And now I dread vacuuming again just as I did before. So, sorry Mr. Dyson, but I had to give you a 2 because you lied to me. It does lose suction and I wasn't trying to suck up an anvil ... just dog hair and dust. I love the design and the baglessness, but it's just not worth the money."
5,Amazing Vacuum,"This product is more than amazing. I am such a fan! I've always wondered if it was really worth it having a vacuum that costs about 500 dollars. But now I see why they call this an ""investment"". So you figure, you'll just buy a crappy vacuum to save yourself some money. Well, then you start to notice that the crap vacuum you just bought is slowly deteriorating within just one years time, even with the most pristine upkeep. So, if you were to save yourself the hassle of buying a new vacuum every year, just buy this one instead. Even if this vacuum only lasts you 5 years, you will still be getting a great deal, because of its 5 year warranty. As far as the actual quality of the product; It does exactly what it says; vacuums w/out losing suction. Cleaning and upkeep is easy too! I'm so crazy that I have even named my vaccum Henry. BUY THIS VACCUM!...or any Dyson for that matter."
5,Wow! Best Vacuum - great for pet hair - I would buy again!,"We purchased this Dyson DC14 Animal model and have been using it for several weeks now. The amount of stuff it vacuums is amazing. It works great on pet hair; several other vacuums got none of what the Dyson got up.It is very easy to operate and to empty out. Not having to deal with vacuum bags is great. We use all attachments and they all work fine; I especially like the ability to pull out the handle and extend it so far -- ours doesn't tip over when doing this.I was surprised how quiet the Dyson is. Our other vacuums were very loud. Our pets are not afraid of the Dyson and even come around when we use it; they ran from the old vacuum. You can hear it running, don't get me wrong, but not like the other vacuums I've owned and seen.Bottom line - I would buy another one again today knowing what I do about it."
2,"Plastic, Plastic, Plastic","Have owned it now for 22 months. It's had 2 beater brush clutch replacements (under warranty). We have hardwood floors & area rugs throughout the house, so it's not a matter of being overworked. The shop technician told me it's been a regular issue with all the Dyson vacuums, as the slip-clutch is pure junk and takes special tools to disassemble. (A common complaint among European users if you do some research) When the next failure occurs, it's going to the dump. Dyson tried to charge me for the second repair & I had to threaten them with the FTC to get it covered.Do the research & invest in a real QUALITY machine, not one that's made entirely of plastic!!!"
3,Dyson does loose suction!!!!!,"I bought the Dyson animal based on reviews here and it does not have the best suction of any vacuum I have had. IT ALSO LOST SUCTION ALOT. The seals are easily misaligned and then you don't have suction as an upright vacuum but if you use the attachments it will work as a really bulky canister vacuum and suck just fine. The seals once misaligned - will easily misalign again. Also, if you use it on a really dusty dirty area you fill up the filter (which I believe is billed as you wont have to replace it because you can wash it). This vacuum was a disappointment. When the vacuum lost suction I called dyson and they talk you through the repair - when the repair doesn't work you have to get nasty with them to get them to allow you activate the warranty. Then, of course, dyson states that the item is not covered. Overall, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THIS VACUUM IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY. My hundred dollar Hoover windtunnel has better suction."
3,Definitely has it's UPS & DOWNS.,"The ups are obvious. Suction is good and all. BUT... there are several qualities in this vaccumm cleaner that I can't stand. It is very heavy and and hard to manuver. Also, I am very particular that everything get clean when I vaccumm (which is why I was willing to pay so much for a vaccumm cleaner in the first place.) In order to really get everything clean, The attachment needs to be used to clean hard to reach places. Usually a hard to reach place means you need a bendable wand to really get to it. The problem with Dysons is that there is about 3 feet of the wand that DOESN'T bend! It's very frustrating to use. Vaccumming stairs is very tiring and difficult, behind the furniture is impossible to do without pulling it away from the wall, below all low to the ground furniture is out of the question, etc.If I had it to do over, I would not buy this vaccumm."
1,IT DOESN'T SUCK.... IT BLOWS,"We have a long haired dog, so we thought this was our vacuum for sure. After one day of usage, we knew right away this vacuum was not for us.1. It mostly blew pet hair around rather than pick it up because the air holes at the front of the unit. Poor design feature.2. It wasn't very good on hardwood or on carpet. In fact, we had to make several passes along the carpet area just to pick up dog hair, plus there wasn't much of anything else in the canister, which made us suspicious that it wasn't picking up dander or dirt. We then passed over the same area with our Bissell, and it was ten times better than the Dyson.3. Attachments were awkward and very cumbersome. Again, our Bissell won out because they are built into the machine.Overall, we were incredibly disappointed, especially because of the high price and after all the hype it receives on commercials and in the stores."
3,No Fit - Nit Wit,"Hoses that are not interchangeable. Accessories that don't fit the hoses.Why make accessories with teeny little differences in diameter? Just so they don't fit??? Design disasters like those discrepancies are just plain inexcusable.Hoses for cleaning stairs that aren't long enough to clean to the top of a (14-step) standard staircase. Dyson better put out a better thought out product - or be prepared to go out of business.Oh, and get service to do their job. Simple questions aren't answered but instead result in silly evasive questions and an attitude of ""we are Dyson, bow down to us.""LOL, and where are the parts numbers for accessories? Where are the vacuum's serial numbers?We own DC14 Animal and DC25 parts that don't fit and service that is simply awful and a zillion unnecessary headaches.Pity."
2,big disappointment,"I went into Sears to get the Kenmore, which consumer reports said was the best. An saleman told me it was great and that only one other was better: the dyson. I had seen the awesome reviews on amazon and did not understand why CR would differ. To make a long story short, the dyson is a disappointment. No doubt, it has tremendous power. I sometimes saw it almost pulling the tiles off the floor. We can see it pulling up a lot of stuff. But then I realized, it is just pulling off carpet. At times, I would have to move the vacuum over visibile debris several times for it to come up. It made me wonder what it is not getting. It was even worse on floors. No doubt, the power is there. But it is not effective. When using attachments, the performance was solid. In short, for this kind of money, I expect better. I just found out I can return it, and I'm going to the store now."
3,"Very strange, yet interesting","This movie is unique. It doesn't really make sense to me, but i like to see it. The music was awesome. How can you go wrong with Prince. Theresa Randle is beautiful!"
2,very average,Spike had a good story line going on.the phone sex business.also Theresa Randle does a good job.Prince's Music works.but the downside to that is that Spike turns it into one big video.all the cameos in the film feel like a Busta rhymes Disc instead of a film.if done right it would have been huge.Spike got a little to happy with the music.he did a better job of frameing Stevie Wonder's music in Jungle Fever than he did Prince in 6.
3,"High impact, not for begginers","This is a high impact, full on, long workout.The moves are quick, the changes aren't practiced, with continual and repeated movement between sets, left me out of count, confused and not ready for changes.I am fit and in shape, 26 and found this to be difficult and I had to lower the impact by changing the workout to reduce stress on knees and back.I wouldn't recommend for beginners or people who don't workout and sweat 3 times week.Fit to very people could like this. Uses hand weights. Intense weight work for arms, moderate work for legs, an achievable abs workout, however short."
3,Okay 3 and a half Stars,"I adore Netrebko. She is a committed artist with a forceful personality that makes everything she does interesting. Now if only her voice would comply with the personality. Each selection is sung with insight. And her rather individual timbre makes for an interesting recital disc. But while lyric passages are gorgeous, the coloratura passages are smudgy. Her e-flats are hit or miss. Live, this would not be a problem since Netrebko's presence would more than make up for any vocal wobbles. On disc, these wobbles can be a little distracting. Of course, she is much more interesting than Gheorghiu or Fleming (but watch out for Harteros!). And there's no denying that this is an important artist."
2,"Nice, but not his best work.","This 1984 release was marketed as a straight out pop release, and there's nothing wrong with that. I quite enjoyed this CD, but I wouldn't say it was an essential purchase. For me, Jermaine early releases for Motown happens to be his best work, but often got lost in the mix. Anyway back to this release. I purchased this mainly for the duet with brother Michael (Tell me I'm not dreaming (to good to be true) which stills sounds great. The self penned 'Come to me' is another high-light, and sounds quite soulful on this collection. 'Dynamite' is another I'd include in this group. The big hit from this CD was 'Do what you do' which I liked at the time, but not now (very MORish middle of the road ballad, sung well by Jermaine). All in all a nice body of work, but not an essential purchase."
4,Hillbilly Boy -- 4 & 1/2 Stars,"Upon first listen, I didn't care for this album; less a few songs (20th Century, People in Grey, Muswell Hillbilly). Fortunately for me, I relistened to this and fell in love. This album is very layered, and is loaded w/ the witty lyrics of Ray Davies. The Kinks are like the Simpsons of music; funny, and lots of subtle social commentary.All in all this is my third favorite Kinks album following their brilliant masterpieces Arthur, and Face to Face. Also worth checking out is Lola, VGPS, Something Else, Kontroversy, Kinda Kinks, One For the Road, and Preservation 1."
1,not one of their best,"The Kinks were a great group, but this album does not compare favorably with their others. The only song I like is Muswell Hillbillies. Personally, I like the live versions of most of these songs that is on the ""Everybody's In Show Biz"" CD"
5,A much needed work,The way the book is written with History and real events as its backdrop makes this a great work. Please keep writing.
5,Not a Better Book Out There!,"I have all three editions of this book and each one gets better. There is no better book on the market to give the reader a thorough understanding of the King James Version. The book also reveals some of the errors and miscalculations that went into the newer versions.One word of warning- after you read this book, be prepared to get back on Amazon to order yourself a King James Bible and get rid of your modern version."
3,The first official word on the bomb.,"This book was written to provide a short description of the atomic bomb project that would satisfy public curiosity without giving away any essential secrets. This edition has an intro by Philip Morrison, who worked on the project, and a nice supplementary essay by Smyth, which fills out the picture a bit."
2,not that great,"this product is defective. i received the shipment and it did not work. i learned from technical suppport that i had to open up the unit in order to clean out the excess grease that the manufacturer had put into it. the grease clogs up the product. it did not work, so the supplier sent me another unit. i discovered this replacement unit had the same problem! so eventually i was able to get the 1st unit to work with effort using the instructions given by tech support. i would have rated the product with 1 star, except that tech support was helpful, and the supplier did attempt to replace/solve the problem."
2,Apparently a refurb or used,"This arrived clearly used, the used status was not disclosed in the ad. Grizzly replaced it, after some polite bureaucracy. It works okay, though it's more of a brute force, than precision tool."
3,"In-detail, organized, but also useless and rediculous info.","The restating of the character creation and organization of the book is very good, but some of the information (Greenwood Ranger) is just plain stupid."
2,I Dislike It,"I'm not too big on the ranger class, not big at all. Robin Hood is an example of a classic ranger."
4,Great workout ;-),"Keli Roberts is one of the best instructors out there. She's definately in my top 5 favourites. She's motivating, knows her stuff and will give you results if you stick with these kinds of workouts.This workout is very varied where you quickly go from one kind of movement to the next. Going from move to move, you work all muscles from head to toe. Within working each muscle, you work those same muscles in different ways like a regular push up and then a push up on a medicine ball - so to work the same muscles with different types of intensity and depth. She cues this really well like usual and it's fun to do. You will feel the burn, but the results are going to come with consistancy. I've done this twice already and love it and while I'm sore the next day, it's a good sore and I enjoy this workout a lot. Another great Keli dvd."
1,Dead on arrival,"Ya got Steve Martin, Dan Ackroyd, Phil Hartman, Glenne Headly, hell, even Austin Pendleton...and you end up with this unfunny moronic piece of c..p. A compleat waste of some great talent."
4,Old Laughs,"You may have forgotten just how funny this one is. It's great for those times when you just want to smile, but aren't sure what to watch. Plus, you have the added benefit that most young people haven't seen it yet! Nothing too objectionable in it, so that's good too."
3,Steve Martin as BIlko,"This was somewhat enjoyable, but predictable version of the Sgt Bilko tale. Martin had some very funny moments and played off the other characters well."
3,Too much and too little,Far too many references to people and events that are not explained or explored. Baldwin III or Raymond II or Godfrey IV did this or that here or there. It became something of a blur.Too little story telling. Poor narrative.
2,BLEH,worst round 2 ever even worse than mike tysons comebackagainst holyfield i wish i could knock the idiot out who approved him doing a second and third
3,Where is the Reunion Show,"I bought the 2nd season and it was great, I got to the end and was very dissappointed that there was no reunion show, like season 1. which was included. How do you get the reunion show. Without the reunion added to the DVD's it is just not the same."
3,Not bad,"I paired this with a Treo 700p, overall it was a pretty decent product. The positive things are that the sound quality is good, streaming mp3s, and listening to Pocket Tunes are both very clear, and the volume is sufficient. The range is also very good, I could walk very far from my phone and still be able to talk on the phone or hear music. The built-in radio was also a plus. The negative aspects of this device is that it's difficult to pair to my phone every single time. At times it would not connect to my phone at all, and I found this very frustrating. The buttons are somewhat confusing, and do not respond properly at times, making it difficult to find the necessary functions. Also the lanyard is very uncomfortable and not cosmetically appealing. If you can get this item on sale for around 30 bucks then it's definitely worth it. I returned it and purchased the Jabra BT3030 which I enjoy much more."
5,The best,"In my opinion this isone of the best enzyme I already ever had, it works pretty well for me , I take one before meal and another one after meal"
1,NOW Foods Super Enzymes,I used this product for a few months. I noticed that the quality is inconsistent. That is not typical for NOW Foods products. I think the second bottle was not doing much at all for me so I stopped taking it.
5,Helped my Chrohn's,"I am not to big on NOW supplements but I bought these before learning the ins and outs of the supplement world, in spite of my feeling about NOW products these work great. I have Chrohn's and its pretty bad. My food comes out the same way it goes in I know that's gross but that's Chrohn's for you and so I was vitamin deficient in D and C. Yep in a modern count scurvy still exists and I almost died from it. I started taking these after that incident and right away my food starting coming out the other end fully digested . It is very obvious to me how well these pills work because I can see it every time I go . No matter what brand or type some people are sensitive when first taking enzymes and they should empty half a pill into some juice or applesauce for a week an then take a whole pill. You cannot OD on enzymes there have been many studies showing you could consume pounds of the stuff and not OD our body is made up of enzymes."
5,6 Stars Out of 5,"I tried these after 2 years of suffering with *possible* ""IBS D."" I say possible because I was never diagnosed with it, but its the closest thing doctors can find, since they are too busy to actually figure out what's wrong with my bowels.If you have thought you might have Habba Syndrome because you get instant, urgent urges to empty your entire body every time you put food in your mouth, you might want to try these. I always had postprandial issues, but taking 2-3 of these pills with my meals changed my life. They are more effective than typically prescribed anti-Ds for me, and they stopped the obnoxious loud gurgling constantly eminating from my intestines, too. I am so glad I found these and wonder why my doctors never once considered my entire range of issues could all be caused by low stomach acid and lack of enzymes.I got these from the seller quickly and in good condition."
3,Eehh...,"It's smaller than you'd expect, and it's hard to make it stand or really... do anything. The 'chain' on the plushie, falls off VERY easilly, but otherwise, it's a pretty good product."
3,Come on Learning Company!,"This product is bittersweet! My 4 year old got this as a Birthday gift. He loves the Dr suess CD with the elephant. Great Game!!! And he really likes the Arthurs Math CD. The Reader Rabbit CD will not load on my computer or any computer I have found that runs Windows 2000. It runs okay on Windows XP....but since we don't own that computer he doesn't get to play it much. The last CD looks too advanced right now so we haven't even tried loading that one yet. So, my advice buy them all separately and watch the system requirements, because the Learning Company tech support is a pain to deal with!"
2,ok,the lens was kinda too big.. even thought I bought the small version... and the ear piece was totally flat so it would have to be heated and moulded - but shouldn't it fit right away? especially for the price of them!!.. they totally slid off my face.. sigh.. I returned them.. but got charged a 15% restocking fee... buy sunglasses only if you have tried them on before hand!!!
2,Could have and should have been much better,"After ""The Fox and the Faith"", this one was disappointing. The author did little to develop Dalton's character, the story wasn't compelling, and there was little progression as one would hope to see in a series. Still, it did have some good points. Those were in the form of two American Indians who learned Cockney English. Their presence was hilarious, and helped save the book. As I've already purchased the next volume, my hope is that it is an improvement."
3,"A Book For Anyone, Anytime, Anyplace","Chris does a good job of writing a book through various styles of genre. In the beginning he writes as a researcher and historian. As he applies the research personally he begins to write as a devotional thinker. Finally, he seems to follow CS Lewis in his reflection and parabolic application.Chris reveals that the cross was not just an instrument of torture--but a punishment attempting to disgrace the victim. It is this shame and disgrace that Christians must live with as they follow a Messiah who was dishonored and humiliated before the Roman world. Carrying the cross on our backs is quite different than wearing a cross around our necks. The cross was an instrument of shame rather than honor. To follow the Messiah calls for a willingness to overcome shame and dishonor, a term Chris calls ""Amazing Disgrace"".This is a book that reminds us of the shame Jesus carried so that we could live with hope. It is this hope that can inspire us to live with honor."
5,Shall We Dance? The Original Japanese,"This movie is very nuanced and works because of the cultural bias against ballroom dancing it depicts along with the many other cultural customs that we Americans do not share with the Japanese. The Americanized version, which I have not seen, could not possibly render a faithful adaption of this wonderful film. Unfortunately, there is a very long preview of the Richard Gere version attached to this particular release of the original. It appears to be an assaulting and shocking adaption. I recommend that you buy this original version in Japanese with subtitles."
5,Rugged and functional,I originally purchased this tool for digging metal detecting finds but use it for gardening as well. I doubt that you can find a hand-tool built any more rugged or any more functional than this tool. I strongly recommend it.
1,Very Disappointed! Don't waste your money.,This bodysuit does not do what it claims. Does not hold anything in at all. This was a total waste of nearly $100 because it is not returnable. It is comfortable if you are wanting a liner for your clothing but don't order it if you are wanting any control at all. Wish I had ordered something different.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased The Complete Reference: Dreamweaver 4 and was extremely happy with the book, but perhaps that's because I was new to Dreamweaver and it fulfilled most of my learning needs. So, when I purchased The Complete Reference: Flash MX, I had high expectations. Unfortunately, those expectations were never realized. Using this book I didn't see much difference between Flash 5 and Flash MX, just a rehash of the old. I was anxious to learn about skins and it was barely mentioned with no instructions on how to alter. Still in the trial period before purchasing Flash MX, I regret my purchase as it now just sits on my shelf, unopened, and I feel that I should have waited until I ordered Flash MX and purchased the book that comes with the program."
2,Not for advance user.,I am so disappointed that this book worth nothing for advance user. I don't think that this book has covered all the features of Flash MX. I expect this The Complete Reference book could save me time and money to learn Flash MX however this book failed its promises. I DON'T like this book!
5,Cosmic Riders,"The Super Furry Animals have always been unique and although they haven't yet broken through to the mainstream they remain Britain's most important cult band.1997's Radiator is the acme of their sound since it showcases all their different faces:the out and out pop of ""Demons""(great song!),the punkish sections of ""She's got Spies"",the techno driven""Hermann Loves Pauline""(probably their best song ever),the freak rush of ""Chupacabras""and the Welsh sung""Torra Fy Ngallt Yn Hir"" all come together to form an album that despite being markedly different from track to track is definitely their own all the way through.It's very rare to find a band with a trully original sound but the SFA are proud members of that elite.Perhaps in a couple of years they become the best band on the planet but while that day doesn't arrive let's just treasure Britain's best kept secret."
1,Nautica Gusseted Pink Firm Support King Pillow,Way too soft! It just becomes a fluff-ball after a few months of use.
3,Quake in your boots,"Good graphics, weapon selection, and gameplay, but offers little value for single-player games. Offers nothing new to veterans of the Quake universe exept for clumsy controls."
2,Time Splitters is still number 1,"Just like Unreal, Quake is another great computer game that was quickly converted to PS2 in an effort to put it on the shelf for a quick profit. The vendor knows the game will sell because: 1) Quake has an enormous name share in the gaming market, and 2) there haven't been any great PS2 games released lately. I hope Sony and software companies stop taking advantage of the PS2 consumers by releasing medicocore games. Quake had so much potential for PS2, but the almighty dollar blinded EA, and they chose to sacrafice quality in exchange for a quick profit."
1,This game SUCKS,I love Quake so when I heard about this one I was so glad so I bought it and brought it home and guess what it sucked it wasnt like Quake 2 or anything It pissed me off If you are a quake fan dont buy this one Its a real disapointment
3,I've Played Better,"Obviously the loading times are quite long and it is very annoying but thats not this games only flaw.First person shooters have always been my favorite genre of games, but this one just doesnt get me going. The graphics really arent what they should be (especially the differant charactors) and there is just nothing there to keep you and your friends there for long. One of its better qualities is its speed. it does move pretty fast, and its easy to learn the controls. However with other fps games out there that do a better job of this same type of thing(unreal,timesplitters) there is no reason to buy this game or even rent it for that matter."
5,nice aloe,I tried this product before in the small 4 oz version. I got this because it was big and a good price and with my prime it shipped free. I really like it. I started using it in my hair as another reviewer suggested and it does a good job of taming frizz. I also use it with my nuface as a catalyst gel. I use it for burns of course too. So it has many uses.
4,Good,"I use this to calm redness from my acne and help with healing. It's lightweight and most of all, not sticky. I have no complaints."
1,Not worth it,This is pretty worthless. It is low grade plastic and the directions are very unclear. The exact same directions are given for two different styles. I have thin hair and this was a total waste.
4,Whacked wheel,"Ordered this to take on vacation at the beach tried it inside of house, not impressed. On carpet or wood floors the front wheel has a mind of it's own, can only go straight and once the wheel starts to turn you can't control it. I took it outside to see if any difference, on pavement it handled a whole lot better. My dogs both seem to love it I just don't know if it is going to work well going from outside to inside or if it's going to be more hassle than what it's worth. It did arrive within just 3 days which was very fast. Putting it together was simple, although I was missing a front faceplate I did get a rain cover for it that wasn't mentioned? Just wished they could do something about the front tire. I'd probably go with a 4 wheeled on if I could do over."
2,This book needs an index.,"The entries for individual saints are well written and informative, but the book is absolutely unsuitable for use as a reference tool. The reason is that the only listing of saints is the Table of Contents, which follows a strictly chronological pattern. There is no index in the back (only a table chronologically listing saints by the year of their death). Thus, if you want information on St. Frances Xavier Cabrini, for example, you'd better know the date of her memorial or else you'll have to go through the entire table of contents, before you spot her name with the other December saints."
3,Representative,"Les Paul's technique is amazing, Mary Ford's singing is pretty good, but as a general music CD it's somewhat boring--no cut really grabbed my close attention."
4,Les Paul Capitol Masters,"Very Good audiofidelity. Enjoyed the Les & Mary recordings more than the instrumentals however. From the historical perspective, Paul's productions are interesting also."
5,Record of the year!,"House of Secrets is by far the best record of 2004. Otep is the most amazing live band playing today. If you have any mental health issues or feel alone, this record is better therapy then any professional. Get your anger out, kill your inner victim, rage on your oppressors, YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Otep takes you to a place that empowers you to go on living. Read the lyrics, feel the energy of violence, cry, take back your life. Get it out. let Otep help you. You will find salvation in this record.Jim Van Matre(...)"
3,VERY MUCH LIKE LAST ALBUM..,"It is too much like last album and the sound is getting rather monotonous. I do still do like Otep overall, but feel the first album ""Sevas Tra"" is the best and truly showcases the female lead's vocal range and ability, and you can understand the lyrics better! I hope she comes out with another album more like ""Sevas Tra"" and explores more than just these latest songs yellings, gutteral and raspy soundings...She has so much more to offer! *Recommend first album more than this one."
1,Worst CD,"This is the worst CD I have ever purchased. It's not that the music is bad, it's that there is very little music on the CD. He keeps talking and trying to sound scary. I want my money back."
4,As well as its predecessor,"Otep has done it again. Although this album isn't filled with great tracks like blood pigs we get a similar formula album (ie: songs broken up with vocal tracks) with a bunch of neat songs with good lyrics. Two of my favorites are Warhead and Nein. I really like the lyric on Suicide Trees : ""I wasn't there, I'm not involved, I'm innocent, It's not my fault"". If you liked the previous album and don't like this one maybe you should switch to rap or blue grass music?"
3,what happened?,"one of the best underground bands just sunk a level. It starts off good, but the starts fizzling out like a bad F A R T. It's a shame because Sevas Tra is a mind boggling metal album, it is just one that sticks out in your collection for all time, a bit of aggression was lost in this. Its hard to believe some members of this band are into death metal when you listen to this"
4,Great Optical Mouse,I now own two of these style mice from Logitech. My original mouse on my computer and now the mouse I just bought for my wife's computer. I use a Mac G3 and my wife has a Window ME machine. Both mice are great. I will never go back to a ball mouse again.
5,Great mouse!,"I was tired of my wireless optical mouse that often needed battery replacement, so I bought this one. It's nice and light, it can be used with anything that has a USB. Buttons are quiet for clicking. Fits well with my small hands."
5,Excellent for the price,"This is a particularly good choice for computer users with small hands who find many mice uncomfortably large. Also it is symmetrical, making it good both for left- and right-handed use. I have had mine for a few years and have never had a problem with it; it works great even without a mousepad. The price is great for an optical mouse. I'll never go back to the regular ball-based ones!"
1,Didn't Work Well At All With My Games or In General,"I bought this mouse several months ago to play some computer games. The first day I used it, the mouse worked fine. The next day I tried using the mouse and it was all jUmPy. I tried playing some games such as Quake with the mouse and it made movements on its own and often got stuck in a spinning cycle. I tried software and drivers for the mouse but nothing worked. The mouse worked a little better in Windows 2000 then XP. DON'T BUY THIS...Pros:Looks good Cons: Jumpy movements moved on its own Didn't work well with computer games Spinned around in games"
3,Ok for most....,"While this mouse is a good deal compared with others like it, I was most unsatisfied when I attempted to move the mouse quickly or in short bursts. It proceeded to jump around the screen for 3-5 seconds while I tried to get it back under control. It also has trouble on some surfaces-a big minus for laptop users."
2,Mixed feelings,"The basic functions of this mouth operate just as well as you would expect: the buttons function smoothly, the wheel works well, and the entire thing is plug & play on my laptop running Windows XP Home.This mouse is NOT, however, suited for gamers.Simply put, the optical tracking system is far too unresponsive. What I mean is this: attempting to move the mouse quick from one side of the screen to the other will result in the optical sensor failing and the cursor simply getting confused instead of making the trip across the screen. Gamers (especially the FPS variety) will find this an extreme detriment to their gaming ability. Invest the extra money and purchase a Logitech mouse with MX Tracking technology - they're much more accurate and responsive, unlike this cheap, clunky device."
4,Logitech mouse,"I bought this Logitech mouse thru Amazon and I am very please with it. It is corded, which is fine with me. The mouse has an internal light that blinks when operating it. Out of a one out of ten I would rate this mouse an eight."
3,Good if cheap--otherwise look elsewhere,"A simple mouse that is optical and slightly more money than it's worth. There is nothing exceptional about this which makes it more compelling than the seven-dollar generics at the computer store, except perhaps for the Logitech logo sticker. I am obsessed with the Logitech logo sticker. It's rubbery and I'm always picking at it for no apparent reason. The case of the mouse is made of that slippery matte finish and slips out of my hands probably because the mouse isn't for normal adult male-sized hands.If you can get it for seven bucks like the knock-offs, go for it. Definitely not worth twenty dollars.And what's with the very thin cable?"
3,Just average,"The overall construction and quality seems good, and I have the iFeel version so its a little bit heavier than other optical mice and the added weight seems better. However, the scroll wheel is the most glaring example of poor design and assembly I've seen in Logitech products. The wheel is very notchy and requires way to much effort to use, also the way in which the driver scrolls pages is inferior (lots of jitters and unresponsive) to my Microsoft optical mouse and my Razer Boomslang mouse. I think I'll be returning this one."
4,CS6000T Sewing Machine,"Very nice machine. Haven't sat down with a sewing machine in 20+ years, so was a bit intimidated with a computerized version. Not a problem with this one. Only issue I've had with it is getting the needle threader to work. It took me four times to accomplish the task, but maybe it was the user."
4,My kids loved this one.,"Purchased at first oportunity, this was a heavily watched movie by kids when they were pre-kindergarten. They are older now, and still watch it occasionally.. the true test of a kids movie don't you think?!"
3,Disappointed,"I have several health issues and have become weak, thus needing an exercise program that works from a chair. To my surprise, the warm up section of the DVD is standing behind the chair, or holding on to the chair for support. I am not able to do this, and without a warm up, don't feel that it's safe to work out. So I am stuck now, trying to find something more appropriate to my situation. 3 stars, as I am sure it's good for other people, but it shouldn't show the guy sitting in the chair stretching out, if that's not what will be done."
4,just right,"Scott Cole's instruction is easy to follow. His voice and manner are pleasing. Note that in one of the two segments, the chair is used as a balancing aid: You stand to do leg work. The other routine is done while seated."
1,"OK, but very disappointing","Given that the story of the 8 German spies is fascinating, it's hard to imagine anyone ruining the story, but that's what happened. Although the acting and writing are well done, the story drones on, without any mention at all of perhaps the most interesting twist of all in the tale: the US Supreme Court holding a virtually unprecedented special session to hear oral arguments in a habeas corpus petition on behalf of the spies whose attorney (an Army colonel, no less!)claimed they should be tried in a regular court room, not by a secret military commission. THe case is Ex Parte Quirin, and is a case anyone interested in military commissions or WW 2 should read. The Supreme Court denied their petition and they were executed. How could this be overlooked, especially when there's footage shown of their attorney on the steps of the US Supreme Court's courthouse? Anyway, as interesting as it is, it is a major disappointment."
3,Dewalt Gloves,These gloves seem to be well made. Cuff's are a little short for me. Overall they are worth the price.
5,The Journey North,"Michael Gettel has an uncanny ability to paint a musical picture of a landscape with a dimensional quality no photograph or mere words could ever convey. His writing of his Journey North is no exception. As a Londoner who spent many years in Scotland, the wonderous imagery captured here is as accurate a rendition of a people, culture, and landscape as you're ever likely to create on a small shiney disc. Superb."
5,Worth it,"I hesitated for a long time because of the cost and considered some parts unnecessary. This is my second purchase of this splitter. It is easy to attach/detach hoses, control the water flow and connect. If you need more than a 2-way splitter, it's worth considering. When adding a hose, I just pop off the extension and connect that to the hose end, rather than trying to turn the hose between the sections. It's not too heavy and the water flow dials move smoothly. No more broken pointer knobs."
5,A Good Place to Start,"I am in the process of learning to make video documentries, and by this point have collected about 6-8 books on the subject.The first book I read was this one, and I would recommend any newcomer to do likewise. If you don't plan to go beyond home videos this could be the only book you will need. But even if you have greater goals this book is an excellent starting point."
4,So Cute,My daughter just received these for kindergarten Graduation from Grandma and Grandpa They are so cute she has been in absolute love with these and that they talk are adorable the stroller is well made. Dolls do need to kind of stand in stroller when they are talking. These deserve 4 or 5 stars. shoes dont come off. We seriously think they rock and they do not walk so I dont get that other review. Any little girl who loves the Bratz Babyz and the Bratz Babyz movie will adore these. The dolls turn there head and say really cute stuff.
3,okay,well it is not junk their talking is great but they dont walk good but the dolls are soooooooooooo cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Loved It!,I will continue on with this series! I love the characters and storytelling! Great depiction of the Old West. Cant wait to start next book?
2,A sassy town marshall - one of the man characters,"This author has a ways to go before becoming a good Western writer. The town marshall needs to develop a new attitude, and stop being so sassy with other characters in the book."
4,Sweet Separation,"Yes,I would agree that it is not Jimmy's best recording,I prefer ""The Dragon is Dancing"" and ""Isle of View"" better for different reasons.In trying to seduce the tall blonde who loved this artist I myself was seduced you might say by his wonderful voice and mystical songwriting.Jimmy Spheeris is really hard to catagorize much like Neal Young is as he is both hard and soft,he is both pop music and deeply mystical.He is someone I have to be in the mood for but once in the mood his Cd's play for hours.The two standards ""I'm so lonesome I could cry"" and It's all in the game"" are my favorite versions of both songs as his deep,rich warm voice captures the songs as if he wrote them himself.Whirlpool is one of my favorite ballads ever and Nightingale always sooths me during rough or sad times.Although I highly recommend this Cd I believe that Dragon is dancing is the place to start with Jimmy and them I assume that you will want the entire collection."
2,freezing up,"alright i dropped my rating to two stars cause it has been freezing up on me from time to time.... always in the 8th or 9 inning too, which means i have to start over"
1,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY IT!,"This is the worst game I have ever purchased. Money down the drain. The game constantly freezes, and if you talk to EA sports they tell you to turn your playstation on it's side. Needless to say, it still freezes. It would be a decent game if it didn't freeze up, but there are better baseball games out there. Don't throw away your money like I did."
2,Who has the patience?,Every year the same thing - new rosters and the same game play. The real problem is that baseball is so long - how could anyone play an entire season? Madden has it down. Great franchise modes - 16 games. That's enough to keep you playing again and again.I rent this game every year - and every year I just end up playing the Home Run Challenge.
5,Carruth 308 Leaping Frogs stone statue,"I was in the market for inexpensive yet unique decorations for a new back porch recently added onto my house. The Carruth Leaping frogs statue fit the bill! What an adorable piece of artwork! It's quite detailed considering it's carved in stone. The ""stack of frogs"" have jovial and comical smirks, yet it's not child-like. It is heavy; I did not try hanging it. I feared it may crack my wall on my back porch if I did hang it."
2,Fairly Dreadful,"Although the accents are authentic, the course is way too basic and repeats the same dialogue throughout the 5 discs with only minor changes. The best book I have found for Egyptian Arabic is Wightwick and Gaafar's ""Colloquial Arabic of Egypt""."
3,great price for these 'classics',"I paid more than twice this much for these movies when BCI put them out a few years back; I should have waited. This Mill Creek collection contains all the movies originally in BCI's Drive-In Cult Classics Vol. 1,2 & 3 plus their After Dark Thrillers collection. It is only missing 'French Quarter' with Bruce Davison off 'After Dark Thrillers' and adds 'Carnival of Crime' and 'Lurkers.'These movies span 1962-1990 and about half are in anamorphic widescreen.Drive-In Cult Classics - 8 Movie SetDrive-In Cult Classics 2Drive-In Cult Classics 3After Dark Thrillers"
4,Great Movies,"Alot Of Camp, And Fun. Just A Pleasure To Watch... Brings Back Alot Of Memories..... Memories Of A Bygone era When There Were Only 3 Channels On Tv, And You Actually Had To Go Outside To Meet People And To Communicate, You Had To Stop At A Payphone."
3,Drive-in 32 movie collection,"Can go wrong with the price for these old 'B' movies.There were some good ones in the bunch, although there was one disc that carried the same movie twice... just by different names. I believe one of the titles of this duplicate movie was 'They saved Hitler's Brain'.Otherwise the variety was okay."
5,Living through it all,Learning to live past the death of a child is the hardest moment in ones life. This book helped us! Read it and let it help you! This book is good for ANY Crisis not just the death of a loved one. Any life crisis is covered. Read it and get better!
3,Lacking Energy and Fun,"This album is lacking the energy and fun of his earlier albums - However, I must say that ""Martha Say"" and ""Pop Singer"" are classicsNOTE: When this album was released it got blasted by the critics and Mellencamp was accused of becoming a country singer - Mellencamp fired back with his ""Whenever We Wanted"" album a year later and put all of those country singer claims to rest"
5,Unbelivable debut album,"All the reviews you've been reading are great. ""Take Your Mama"" is a great first single but it is not the best song on the CD, so don't go thinking, 'well i only like that song, should i buy the CD?' JUST BUY IT. The slower songs on this disc bring it home, but the upbeat ones just make you wanna get up and move.Ignore 'Comfortably Numb.' It's totally unnecessary on the disc but doesn't bring it down.Great debut!!"
1,AWFUL!,"Actually, I give this 0 stars. I really don't understand what all the hype is about over this CD. I was tired of reading the glowing reviews so I bought it to check it out for myself, and I admit that I did listen to the entire CD but it was excruciatingly painful! Not a single good song on the whole thing --- just awful."
1,They SUCK!,"I would give them a minus star if available.I saw them on SNL too & thought it was a joke.This is one of the worse bands I have ever heard!If this band can make it on TV, ANYONE can."
1,The one album all good music lovers must avoid,Scissor sisters are one of the worst bands on this earth who are responsible for the revival of crappy disco which was thankfully dead since the seventies.I hate this horrible band as they have taken arguably the GREATEST ROCK SONG COMFORTABLY NUMB from PINK FLOYD and converted it in to a horrible dance remix.STAY AWAY FROM THIS ATROCIOUS ALBUM AT ALL COSTS.
5,Awesome CD!,"I recommend this CD to anyone who like eclectic types of music. I love the song 'Filthy Georgeous', pretty funny if you listen to the words. GLAD I MADE THE PURCHASE! Whole CD is put together well. I listen to it from beginning to end and enjoy every minute of it."
4,Took a while to grow on me...,"At first listen, the only 2 songs I liked on this CD were ""Take your Momma"" and ""Return to OZ"". The rest just annoyed me, especially ""Comfortably Numb"". I decided to give it more of a chance based on a friend's advice and I'm glad I did. It's become one of my favorite CD's of the past year. Seeing them in concert recently only sealed the deal. This is one of those ""Love 'em or hate 'em"" groups."
4,sassy,"I saw them (the Scissor Sisters) on Saturday Night Live a few weeks ago prior to that I had never heard of them. I just heard one song but it was enough to make me want to hear more. And I am glad I did! Every review I have read about them compares them to some pop or disco icons of the 70's and it's all true. The sound like the music we grew up with, happy and full of energy.I enjoy listening to this CD on my 45 min commute home, it passes the time in a real upbeat way, I find myself singing along like a rock star! All in all, it is a great album, I'm glad I took a chance on someone I knew nothing about. (By the way, I thought Ana Matronic was a chick on SNL, Am I the only one?)"
1,They butchered a great song,"I just saw a rerun of SNL where they performed, and their first song was okay. Nothing special. I thought they were trying to sound too much like the Bee Gees. Although I like the Bee Gees, their copycat falsettos rubbed me the wrong way.And then they played their second song, and once I heard the lyrics, I cringed: they took a classic Pink Floyd song, ""Comfortably Numb,"" and disco-fied it (they even had the Bee Gee's Stayin' Alive ""ah ah ah""'s in there, what the heck?). I like disco music, but that song is NOT meant to be a disco song.If they had done a decent cover of it, I may not be as disturbed as I am now. But the thing of it is, that song shouldn't be covered period.I would not recommend Scissor Sisters. It seems to me they copy the other great bands out there. I'd suggest they try some original stuff for a change."
1,Plain old boring,"I'll make this short.If you want original music - get the original artists.Pink floyds classic is covered on this album, the original is better.The rest of the album sounds like Elton John mixed with Roxy Music, Super tramp and various other original artists - but it's all so bland and boring.Don't go there..It's not worth it.. It you want lyrics that relate to everyday life & sexuality - get yourself some morissey instead - if you want proper music - get music made by people that know how to!"
1,deplorable and disgraceful,"i really got angry with my sisters for playing this rubbish in the house today and ruining my day.music this bad should come with a health warning sticker.u better believe it coz floydian expert says so.amon amarth,mercyful fate and obituary are much better than this lousy group.0 stars."
1,What was Wilbur Smith thinking?,I am a big fan of Wilbur Smith and have read almost everything he has written. This book was drivel. I do not know what he was thinking. Totally predictable and unrealistic from the Character descriptions and the plot ( or lack there of) I was very diappointed.
5,phenomenal,"WS at his best. This novel was a great change of pace. Quick, easy but captivating read. Almost read all of WS but would love to read something of comparable pace."
2,Below Wilbur Smith standard,"I have read every book written by Wilbur Smith, enjoyed them all; particularly like the feeling and sentiment transmitted when writing about Africa, its people, its animals and its landscape. In this book I find the plot somewhat artificial; Wilbur Smith is out of his homeground. Furthermore when he talks about Spain and the bullfights with a rather twisted description, its obvious he neither knows nor understandsthe spanish mentality or the true spirit of a millenary spectacle such as the bullfight. Luis Merlo"
5,very clever book,"Not the most well known of his novels, but one worth very much consideration. The technology my be out of date now, Mirage fighter aircrafts having been retired from service for so long.What remains in the mind is the twists of fate for the main characters and how they master them.The fate of the main character, his partner and how they find their happiness togehter, despite the cruelty of what they have to bear.I doubt it would have come to the happy end implied, but Smith placed his characters in such a complicated situation that anything is possible.Essentially it's a ""love conquers all"" story, powerful, sad perhaps no longer accurate in terms of today's ""fast food living""But a worthy book indeed"
2,Eagle in the Sky,A fun fast read but not up to the Wilbur Smith standard. Of the 18 of 31 of his novels that I have read this was my least favorite.
3,Stop trashing it and THINK,"Ok, people trash the music. Fair enough, it's your opinion, but if you THINK about it, it states on the CD cover that the music is THE UNDERSCORE. Why did you buy this CD if u didn't expect background music? Celine Dion, yeah, not the best female vocalist. But that Norwegian gal who did the vocals was truly a master of her art. The thing which disappointed me was the fact Horner used synthesisers, why cheat like that when u have a whole orchestra at your disposal? He used fake voices which i have on my synthesiser. Why couldnt he USE A CHOIR for god sakes?!!?!?!?!!? Either way, the combination of strings and Irish pipes were pretty well done. Get over the whole Celine Dion thing, its only 1 track out of 16! SKIP IT.Get over it, and try and open your mind and think about the musical quality."
5,Titanic Soundtrack- the best!!,"I love this CD! It's so relaxing. I love to just pop it in and lie down. I would recommend this CD to anyone. And, if you haven't seen the movie- go see it! It's worth your money! END"
1,Makes me wish I had gone down with the Titanic,"I'm sick of hearing about Celine Dion and that stupid My Heart Will Go On crap. I hate Titanic and I hate the moronic, boring music in this CD. For retards only."
1,Celine Dion is a Has-Been,"This album is very sad and the only thing that is carrying it, let's face it, is the Titanic Movie label. ""My Heart Will Go On"" would never even had made it on the Top 50 of the Billboard had it not been associated with the movie.All in all, I will say that this album should appeal to all the sappy, starry-eyed, hopeless romantics on that ultimate lifelong quest for their dream guy/girl."
3,Titanic,"The score can be summed up like this: interesting flutes, bagpipes, a wailing voice, unabashedly synthetic choirs, and typical Horner action music (which I appreciate the structure of, although not everybody does). Also, the rather timeless melody that we all know and love. This is one of the big ones you're supposed to get, so get it if you haven't.I only gave three stars because I prefer other kinds of scores, really--it's good for what it is."
3,Milking the cow,"There is nothing new here, merely the repackaging of the original soundtrack as first released, and the second release of additional music: Titanic and Return to Titanic. So if you have those already you don't need this one."
5,Very nicely done,"I really like the first song, ""Never an Absolution"". I use it as background music when I'm doing an emotional speech/ceremony in DeMolay. It fits so well with the words of the ceremony, and the emotion is so strong that it will most always get one or two or even more people to cry. It is just an amazing piece of music."
5,Magnificient!!,"This soundtrack is absolutley amazing. This comes right after BRAVEHEART (the movie and soundtrack which Horner also did! Check this out also!!) From the minute I saw the movie, I knew I had to have this music.I cry everytime I hear it. LEO and KATE were awsome together. James Cameron has done it again- his directing was superb. How can you wait till December 98 to buy the movie??! BUY THIS soundtrack, its the closest you'll get to viewing this masterpiece!!!! One regret- where is that fabulous 3rd class dancing music??TITANIC is worth every penny. END"
2,Not bad music to accompany a sinking,"Other than the sinking sequence, I'd suggest that you really like Irish music before investing in this disc. As for the Celine Dion fans, wait for her greatest hits disc."
2,congrats to will jennings,"i was very excited to buy the cd, but after listening to it, i realized it was just average musically. it tugged on the emotions for a little while, but after that started to get old, i was left with the same old notes, just repeated to get different songs. on a brighter side, will jenning's lyrics in ""my heart will go on"" are superb, which is why this review gets 2 stars rather than one."
5,IT IS A GREAT CD!!!,"I realy liked this CD. Who cares if only one of the songs had any singing, the songs that did not have singing in them were still so buttiful! I have lisened to the CD so mutch my dad said I will probly break the CD player. I loved the moive too. It was so well done I think that it and the soundtrack all deserve a great review!"
2,"If you know Horner, it's nothing new","Ransom, Jumanji, Apollo 13, Braveheart, Willow, Titanic, and the Rocketeer all have one thing in common: James Horner. And yet, if you listen to the music of each one, then listen to Titanic, you can literally pick out the similarities. Titanic has nice music to it, but nevertheless, it is repetitious of his former works. In several ways, it is almost as if Horner took all his former musical scores and combined them into this one album. I like Horner's music, but artists should not continue to create if they lose their creativity and originality."
2,The soundtrack sinks too!,"If there ever was any music that made you feel as if you've taken a salty dip in the frijid north Atlantic, this is it! The overall schmaltziness of the orchestration is enough to make anyone over the age of 30 blow chunks. And that boney Canadian wheezes like three cats in a gunny-sack. If you really want to be reminded that you dropped $7.50 to sit through three mind-numbing hours of paper-thin plot, Shatneresque acting, and an ending that the Titantic lookouts surely would've seen coming, then this CD is for you. But, personally, the whole thing left me cold. Oh yeah,.....the damn boat sinks!!!"
2,Only for hardcore admirers of the movie,"This soundtrack is a good example of why a soundtrack can not always just be put on an audio-only medium. These melodies are OK as a dramatic sound illustration of the things happening on the big screen. But just listening to these illustrations becomes pure boredom.The classical stuff sounds like some half-done mixture between a bad plagiate of Vince DiCola and a string rehearsal. But the worst thing is that Karl Jenkins'ish choir (but with less fantasy) ruining every single track.It's like one long melody, anyway. And not even with a great deal of variation in the theme! A single-CD would have been clearly enough (then we might have been saved from the standard 'diva' ballad from Cรฉline Dion as well, oh what wishful thinking)."
4,Great treadmill and you can't beat the price!,"I have had my treadmill for about 6-7 years now, It's great! Not any noisier than the ones at the gym and has most of same features for a fraction of the cost. I would definitely buy an Image treadmill again."
5,Best of Eric Carmen,"This is the best greatest hits of Eric Carmen and I would recommend this right away. The sound is pretty good and includes some features in the booklet. Although, it only has ten tracks, but it has his best in those ten."
4,Not a toy,"Small and can be carried in a pocket, purse or on a key chain with no problem. Shoots a stream about 10 feet. I bought this for my wife and now she feels safer shopping and jogging."
5,A Great Game!!,"This game is wonderful... its the same set from the TV Show, minus Dick Clark and the original theme song... Either Way its a great game... Definatly get this... and then get the GameShow Network CD with the shows theme song, just so you can have it as well!"
5,My Favorite Artist Of All Time!,"I have listened to Jim Ryser for the better part of my life in good times and bad. His music always made both BETTER! I live in Indy and fell for his music and voice as soon as I heard ""Same Old Look"" on the Bob and Tom show1991..from there I found he was playing a concert on the 'Indy Circle' on my birthday. I went, was 'BLOWN AWAY' by his beautiful voice and incredible energy...the rest is HISTORY. This was in 1991 and I cannot go without listening to his music. His beautiful voice is a melody that will never fail to make me feel what he so intended. So glad I found his music...I have all I have been able to find!Brenda Leigh Coniglen"
3,"If You Like Your Martinis And Jazz ""Dry""","Not quite what a Supertramp fan would look for, John Helliwell's first solo venture comes off as modern jazz, rather than the spice he added to Roger Hodgson and Rick Davies's salad days. Reminds me of why there's so little jazz on today's radio dial -- 'cos it's so hard to understand, not to mention enjoy. Supertramp fans should instead taste Hodgson's solo work, or the band's later live albums. But if you just love post-WWII jazz, well, this could be the next big thing."
4,VERSATILE ROCK & POP,"Dave, one half of Eurythmics, has been making rock history since the early 70s. This remarkably versatile 1991 offering kept the flag flying - it is replete with all the elements that made Eurythmics so special: Strange visionary lyrics, brilliant hooks and subtle, understated production. He's quite a chameleon -- on Soul Years he outbowies David, on King Of The Hypocrites (a complex piece with disturbing undertones) -- he outdylans Bob and on Love Shines he outmccartneys Paul. Jack Talking is a smooth funky ditty evocative of the Bee Gees, This Little Town is a Kinks-like number with folksy harmonica, On Fire has a lush, guitar-driven wall of sound, while Fashion Bomb boasts a mixture of dance style rhythms with glam-rock overtones and Party Town reminds one of the underrated Tourists, particularly in the juxtaposition of lugubrious lyrics with the orchestral fullness of the backing. A delightful listen."
3,Classic TV Western Collection,"A few before hand old series I'd not heard of. For the most part the collection covers all of that genre. A nice addition to my DVD collection, a when I'm in the mood to watch a particular episode, its' there for me to do so."
4,Not as Magical as the Others...,"The Scalawagons is another attempt by Oz Illustrator John R. Neill to continue the oz series. tHIS BOOK, is certainly not the best, but will please any oz fan. The plot revolves around the Wizard's new invention, based off of his Ozoplanes (See Ozoplaning With the Wizard of Oz) Tik-Tok is appointed as superintendant of the royal scalawagon factory, but things go haywire when he runs down. Along comes the Bell-snickle, a mystery even to himself, who takes advantage of Tik-Toks helpless condition by loading the Scalawagons with flabber-gas. The Wizard hasn't counted on this and loses nearly all of the Scalawagons. It takes a whole book to tell of the rescue of the Scalawagons, filled with the not so fascinating adventures of Jenny Jump (a character created by Neill), a rubber ghost, the Nota Bells, Bob Up, and Notta Bit More the Clown."
5,True Nautical History,"I Enjoyed the book. Having read a number of sailing stories, this one gives a real sense of history of the time, in both the political and sailing worlds."
4,Good quality material. Attractive.,"We ordered these for as a birthday gift for the golfer that has everything ""golf."" He's a pro and instructor. This was his first pair of golf cuff links and he likes them. They are not heavy, the metal is of good quality, and they look nice."
3,"retrofluff, inc.","there's some great moments on this record (""six times"" -- wow!), and the band's refusal to believe that it could be anything but 1966 is admirable. but ""pet sounds"" this ain't...."
4,Fobus Holster.,Bought this for a buddy. Fits his Taurus really well. Not a lot of options for railed guns. Seems to hold gun very well. Will be nice for concealed carry. Good snug fit.
1,Gobble-gobble-gobble!,"If this is an album to stand up with Yes' best, then I have a bridge in Brooklyn you might be interested in. This thing stinks from the git-go; some of Anderson's most puerile writing, Steve Howe sounding as anonymous as any other guitarist(and he's NOT any other guitarist!) and Wakeman and Bruford telephoning in their stuff. Sorry...I love Yes and I like these guys together with and apart from each other, but this album should be stuffed, roasted and eaten on Thanksgiving!"
5,"This is the best business book ever written, ever!",No book will ever match up to this. The ideas are brilliant and easy to understand. Best book ever. Period.
1,Lots of fluff,To much fluff and not enough to do. Typical book of common sense. I was hoping for more facts or ideas. Very plain. Better off hiring a cheer leader.
4,"Great audiobook, now I want the real book","I just finished the audio book and was rather impressed with the information, I'm going to get an eBook and do some notes/highlighting. There were tons of good points about how to market service which is a different challenge than marketing what can be seen and admired."
5,Keep this book at your side at all times.,"Whether you're CEO of a Fortune 500 company or a hot dog street vendor, this book truly will be your guide to successfully marketing your company/service. I've purchased it as gifts to all the senior managers and the CEO in our company and I'm back here at Amazon.com to buy a few more for my fellow managers. (I wonder if I can get a commission from Amazon.com?)I've read many books on marketing. None quite like this one.Don't recommend it to your competition."
1,Pic is wrong,The picture doesnt match what is actually sent. They are actually all black handles and a different shape. If your looking for what is shown it is not this.
4,Homeopathy for our children,"I found this book encouraging for parents who have children with these diagnoses. As a lay-homeopath the case studies were insightful. Parents need to be aware that a trained homeopath is best at treating their family member.The book gives hope to those looking for help in a sadly lacking sea of treatments, especially those looking for real results without harmful drugs."
2,GREATER TUNA DVD,"This DVD was purchased for my husband who absolutely loves Joe Sears and Jaston Williams. We both first saw this hirlarious team on HBO when it first came out in the 80's. My husband and I both couldn't wait for their second show. With that said, since we both enjoyed the first show so much, I decided to get the original DVD for a Christmas present. I was not happy with the presentation or quality of the DVD version. It was not like we remember it being when it was shown on HBO. What a disappointment. We will now only see this ""Texas Town Toddies Duo"" LIVE on stage--so much of the humurous glamour was lost from stage to DVD. What a shame!!!"
4,No other reviews?,"As someone who listens to a great deal of ""atmosphere pop"", I can say with conviction that this is better than most in the genre. Worth a listen."
1,A very conventional AMA approach to a very difficult problem,"I was very disappointed in this book. Many of the recommendations are commensensical like de-stress your life and eat better, but the emphasis on finding a cocktail of over-the-counter aspirins was a real turn-off. McIlwain does not list any supplements like lecithin which have been found to be helpful. If you have a completely unhealthy lifestyle and you've never tried one thing to address your problem, this is the book for you. If you feel you have tried everything--then you should keep looking down the bibliography."
1,"A Stupid ""Movie""","Do NOT buy ""Timothy Mark presents 'Chains'"". This ""movie"" is just a bunch of raw footage cut together with the occasional sound of a cat stepping on an alesis synthesizer for ""sound effects"". You would be better off spending your money on instruments of suicide. It would be more enjoyable than watching ""Timothy Mark presents Chains"""
3,"Happy, yet dissapointed","I am happy with my purchase....good price and it arrived earlier than predicted. That being said, it was advertised as ""new"" but was actually used. The package showed signs of wear and tear and the disks are scratched. All of the disks worked just fine and I don't mind buying used video but it should have been listed as ""used""."
5,Excellent work on migration,"A reader from NY says:""Excellent work on migration.""Pro:a) provides good backgroundb) unbiased coveragec) good use of primary sourcesCon:a) I wanted to see more coverage of Central Asian Republicsb) published in 1995, needs significant of updates"""
2,"OK phone, No Caller ID","The caller ID feature on this phone takes so long to register who has called that your answering machine has picked up before you can know who called. If you are buying a phone with built in caller ID, look elsewhere."
5,This phone fooled my girlfriend,"I have a girlfriend with whom I speak every night and she hates and despises cordless phones. She says that she always knows when it's a cordless because she hears background noise. This VTECH phone is so clear that she doesn't know when I use it. Believe me, this is no small feat. I have other cordless phones in the house and she immediately notices if I use any other one!"
4,1932,"I have the 1932 and the 1922 and am really pleased with both - well thought out buttons, loud button sound, choice of four rings, volume control, backlit display, etc. One problem is that it doesn't stay in its cradle well when wall mounted, but if you need it for a night stand, like I do, it is great. The Caller ID feature is awesome with scrolling and time stamp which I find particularly useful. Pick one today and if you aren't happy take it back. ... ."
4,Good Elliptical for the money.,I bought this elliptical about 3 years ago and its still going strong. Don't have any problems with it. The only complaint I have is that it took me 4 hours to put it together. Hence the 4 stars. This is a good elliptical for the money.
1,Don't trust this company,"I bought this item direct from ProForm. I should had known better than to be fooled again. The item worked for five months, and then the main pedal axel broke. Well, no problem I thought - I have the extended warranty. That turned out to be a joke. It has been almost three months later and the piece of equipment still sits broken. If they actually cared about their customers they would send a new unit out after the first time a technician couldn't fix it."
3,You get what you pay for!,I bought this elliptical four and a half years ago and till today I use it four to five times a week. Keep in mind though that I am not a very big person. The elliptical has some major problems:1. Since the beginning the resistance on this machine has not worked properly. And now it doesnt work at all!2. The right arm has got so loose that I have actually tied it with a scarf to put it together.3. The surface of foot is so slippery that your foot does not stay where you want to place it.4. The frame of the machine is flimsy.However for 300 bucks this machine has performed O.K. and can still go on. Thats why I gave it three stars!
2,Alyson Hannigan is the only reason to watch this movie,"I was really excited about seeing Alyson Hannigan in a movie where she's not playing Willow (from Buffy) or Michelle (from American Pie). Unfortunately, Alyson is the ONLY bright spot in this movie and there was not even enough of her. It was truly painful to watch at times. Everyone else's acting was atrocious. Jennifer Esposito should have her Guild card revoked for her performance. The story was awful, the script worse. If you're an Alyson Hannigan fan, watch it once for her performance. Skip through everything else. You won't miss much."
4,Great live Dead & tons of fun.,"I like this collection - CD #1 is ""grate"" and #2 can hold its own. The sound quality is very good, which is always important to me. This is in December of '73 - and includes some of the better tunes off of Wake of the Flood, which was released earlier that year (and also happens to be one of my favorites...)One ""Music Fan"" review says that this CD tells us how to get the other Dick's Picks CDs (which I've never seen in the stores...). I searched all over my copy, and could find no such info....Enjoy!"
5,"Well written, enjoyable and on the mark","A well-written easy-to-read book that right on the mark as it tackles one of the most difficult problems in contemporary judaism. As with all of Dershowitz' books, this one is filled with humor, meticulously researched and contains compelling arguments in support of his view that organized judaism is failing to provide the proper educational foundation to ensure the continuation of reform and conservative judaism in the USA.Even if you, like me, do not share Mr. Dershowitz' orthodox background or left-wing politics, don't let that deter you from reading this excellent book."
4,Important problem faced by World Jewish Community,"I agree with Mr. Dershowitz that education is the ideal solution to the ""Vanishing World Jew"" problem, buth how will we be able to involve the great majority who is not interested in reading, attending conferences or think about certain profound questions. The majority of people are conformists, they are only in search of professional, social or economic successes. There are those who also do not want to know because they feel unconfortable to face their Jewishness, so they hide behind the thought that we are all the same and that G-d is universal. It would be wonderful to find a way to make ""being Jewish"" fashionable. How to do it is the big question."
1,No longer a fan,I like the old books by Heather Graham so much more than the newer ones. I will no longer purchase any of her books until the book has been reviewed by several people. I'm also irritated with the publishers for putting this kind of trash out in hardback format.
3,"Nope, does not work with E-115",Greetings! Unfortunately I have to disagree with Neil - the FZ-500P does NOT work with the E-115. I just received it and the manual clearly states that it does only support models up to the E-105. Casio's customer support center confirms that. But to all the pre-E-115 owners: This device is sooo cool :) Just buy holding it in my hands I can tell that I would LOVE it (if it would work with my Cassiopeia). That's why I give it 3 stars (kinda to stay neutral).Other than that: Don't Panic! (42)
3,how to date the classic,"This should have been a classic. Some of it is essential, in it's purest pop song writing state. Production made it sound like dated 80's crap. I think they knew that because the next album was striped bare by comparison. Buy it for the song writing. Seen live, this band killed. Never got it quit right on tape."
5,"Most Creative, Inspiring Album Ever","This album is flatout amazing in everyway. The lyrics are dreamlike, strange, disturbing, uplifting, and always easy to listen to. This is the greatest album in my book."
5,Awesome Collection,"I don't really have anything bad to say about this edition. ""Werewolf"" and ""Future War"" are two of my favorite episodes from the series and the extras are great. I love the lengthy History of MST3k and the Comic-Con Q&A. The really cool part was that it has all of the openings from the series. The only thing I didn't like was that the History of MST3K is broken into three parts on three discs. I would have liked it better to have been all together, that way I won't have to switch discs to see parts 1 2 3 when I just want to watch the History. That is such a minor problem, it won't hurt my rating. The Crow mini-statue is cool as well."
4,"Interesting, but not the best material","First of all, there's only one Joel episode (First Spaceship to Venus). The packaging, which by the way is excellent, gives you know clue of this and if you don't happen to remember when the episodes aired it's a little hard to keep track.The treatment stays true to form though with all four movies and I did liked the discussion of the show by veterans of the program. I've gotten very few of the MST3Ks on DVD (I played the tapes to death!) but this one is well worth getting a hold of."
3,Great movies-Bad packaging and extras,Everyone knows the movies and the Bots/Mike/Joel are great but the packaging on this leaves much to be desired. I could barely get the box with the movies out of the tin container without ripping the box. I almost broke the figurine of Crow not knowing that it was secured to the bottom of the plastic with a tie knot. After untying the knot I still had to cut the plastic that housed the figurine so as not to break it. The lobby cards are nothing but replicas of the fronts of the dvd cases and are on crappy thin paper. I am afraid of putting the movie case back in the tin container because it is too hard to get it in and out. Oh well.
4,it was hilarious!!!,"When i started to watch this, it was hilarious. Couldnt stop laughing the whole time it was on. the minute they started riffing the movie i was on the floor laughing."
3,Joseph Smith and the Golden Plates - Book Of Mormon,"It was disappointing to hear from the expert commentators that no one else but Joseph Smith saw the Golden Plates.The truth is, there were eleven witnesses who viewed the plates. They all testified to that fact. Their names and testimonies are written in the first few pages of the Book of Mormon. Everyone can see for themselves. As a Mormon, I believe that the Book of Mormon is scripture and the keystone of our religion. The book is either true or the biggest hoax ever. Test it for yourself."
2,Boring at best.,I really didn't know what to expect and maybe should have looked into this a little more. It is a good attempt but does not really give you any more information on the Unsolved Mysteries than you probably already know and will be included in my next yard sale after only one viewing. I would not purchase this DVD again.
1,"buy a dog, you'd learn more about reiki","This book is a re-hash of the Takata lineage of Reiki, along with some added tidbits from the New Kadampa Tradition (a splinter of the Gelug School) of Tibetan Buddhism. I think that a book which could have been wonderful was destroyed by lack of the right information, and the authors own interpretations of Buddhist practices and how they connect with Reiki, without a strong background in the Buddhist Reiki practices. In my personal opinion, you are better off buying a book by Frank Petter, and combining it with your own Buddhist studies, because this book isn't worth it."
3,Nice for the price,"For the price paid, these are nice earrings but they are larger than they appear in the illustration and the lab-created opals look a little ""too"" lab-created in bright light. Also, the posts are super long so if you forget to take them out before you go to bed they poke into your head. I bought them when they were on sale for around $15 to go with a much more expensive opal and diamond pendant from Blue Nile so they really suffer from the comparison. On their own they are much more appealing."
1,So What?,"This Bette Davis movie isn't bad, I guess, but it sure is a bore. So she doesn't believe in marriage and is living in sin with Gene Raymond: well, what of it? Takes more than that to be interesting, I'm afraid. Most noteworthy because it features Frank McHugh as an egghead, very different from the ""Toity toid street"" roles he got later in life. Rent it if you've got time to lose and money to burn."
1,A tasteless attempt at mocking the rich that wasnt funny,"This book attempts to satarize the elite English but trys too hard, it is unrealistic. Many schools have been forced to read it and I have not met one student who liked it."
3,Ho-hum..,"Very odd book that turned into a very boring book with a very strange ending, to say the least. While the prose was witty, entertaining and lyrically delightful, the plot was just too odd for me."
4,Great Stress Relief,"These balls are wonderful. I've had problems with my back and neck for years and these balls really help. I use them to release the tension in my muscles before I start my yoga routine. The DVD is not the type of DVD that you watch over and over. It is merely an instructional video that shows how to use the balls. Once learned, there are endless possibilities!"
4,Little Girls Love Their Daddies...,"...whether they grow up with them around or not. If today's young people could only understand that. Even a girl without a father may wonder, whether she realizes it herself eventually or not, what kind of a person she shares her chromosomes with. Luckily, Linnet and Rosalind don't have to wonder.This book is a dad's-eye view of his girls, but even more remarkably, it's a girl's-eye view of their father, as told by the father. The author does a great job of presenting both sides, and of showing not only his daughters' growth, but his own.And woven throughout the book like a black thread in a tartan skirt is the everyday dealings with race. Each member has their own very poignant coping mechanisms, and the truth isn't always very pretty to read. Still, I recommend the book, because it illustrates the special understanding a man can have of his girls and vice-versa."
3,"Lightweight, Top 40 Music","I'm embarrassed to admit that I used to like this album.... when I was about 15. True, there are some catchy hooks in a number of the songs and Landslide has always been a favorite, but c'mon. The lyrics could've been written by an 8 year old.Monday Morning: ""Monday morning you sure look fine. Friday I've got travelling on my mind... first you love me and then you get on down the line...""Crystal: ""Do you always trust your first, initial feeling....""Warm Ways: ""Sleep, easy by my side. Into, gentle slumber you can hide.""Rhiannon is just plain dumb from beginning to end.Who writes crap like this?Sorry folks. It stinks."
3,The Calm Before The Storm,"The first big step towards Pop from their English-Blues beginnings, FLEETWOOD MAC is the Christine McVie-dominated calm before the RUMOURS storm.McVie's ""Warm Ways,"" ""Over My Head,"" and ""Say You Love Me,"" and Nick's ""Landslide"" are the songwriting highlights here, a real showcase of female sensibility in a band previously known for heavy macho posing.The song everyone talked about at the time, ""Rhiannon,"" isn't really much of a song at all. Buckingham's guitar work on the tune is fantastic--he's an underrated player--but there is virtually no melody in the verses and the lyrics are simplistic at best. The song works because of the band playing it, not the woman who wrote it.This was a big deal album. Little did we know it was just a warm-up for their next LP, RUMOURS."
5,choo-choo,2 year old started train obsession after this book :) pictures are wonderful we read it almost nightly. And easy to enjoy
2,Kindle Version-- BEWARE!!,"Bought the Kindle version of this-- mainly with an interest to see what a kid's book looks like on a Kindle. The story is decent enough, but the interface is AWFUL!! It doesn't just read like a book. Two or three pages of the book (some randomly repeating) show up on each Kindle page and you have to touch on and enlarge each page to actually read it. Quickly tiresome to the average toddler. So, be warned. I wish I'd just have ordered the hard copy version. For the price of either, though, it's not that great a story-- ok story with pretty plain/uninteresting illustrations."
4,Nice Bedtime Read,This book is a nice bedtime read. Good illustrations and cadence. Any kid would love to have this read to them.
5,My son loves this book!,My 2 year old loves this book. This is his must read before he will go to sleep. It's a cute story and the illustrations are great.
5,Beautiful book,"My daughter (age 2y) loves this book. It has a very sweet, simple rhyme which my daughter helps repeat with me. It also has very beautiful, fun illustrations which make it one of my favorites."
5,Great for many ages!,My 4 year old is obsessed with trains which was initially why I bought the book. But all of my kids (ages 1-7) love this at bedtime. The illustrations and story are equally wonderful and whimsical. I'm tempted to buy a second copy for a keepsake.
1,Horrible on Kindle Fire!!,"It is very hard to read on the Kindle Fire. The type is so small, you cannot read it. They have typed the words larger below, but is on a different page than the illustrations. I wish I could get my money back. What a waste!!"
5,rain chain,I really love the way this looks: it was easy to install and looks great with water flowing through it.
5,IF,"If you have ever seen Greater Tuna, you will love this new Christmas classic! Jaston and Joe play all the parts to perfection."
5,re-decorator,I don't know why this product is so hard to find in the 16 oz. size. Wal-Mart used to carry it but they only have the Coco Butter Fruit of the Earth. The original vitamin E lotion was the best. It is only available in the 4 and 11 oz. I wish the company would make it in the larger amount again and Wal-Mart and well know drug stores would carry it again.
5,Not Tupac? That is correct,"If your looking for California love remixes, wrong section.But this book is great, and a long read. Polished this one off following Niccolo Machiavelli's ""The Prince"" and I must say - I didn't think it was as interesting nor did it seem to keep my attention as well. Really good for someone interested in political philosophy that can be related to modern day events in some form or another."
2,just ridiculous,"I got this quite a while ago so I am going on memory but I found the spells in this book to be neither powerful nor actually spells. I believe this woman was known as the Supermarket Witch or something where she claimed that all you needed to cast spells was in your grocery store? That is like saying all you need to do surgery is in your Walgreen's. That is not the case at all with magick. It is a course of extremely intensive study which continues over a lifetime. Books like this are just sold by publisher's using magick to make a buck. They are ridiculous, ultimately."
5,Almost as good as a power drill!,Great if your power drill broke or for your child. fast easy safe. Im a Carprnter and I use it all the time for drilling holes or for sctewing in screws!
3,The slow middle,"to quote Solinas, who reviewed this product, ""Her kidnappers are the mysterious Ririn, Kuroudo and Noba -- and they quickly lure Ichigo and Co. on a series of bizarre games, with Ichigo's friends as the prize. First it's a chase around town, then a surreal maze in the local museum. Finally, they're brought back to school, where they must uncover who the imposter among them is... or everyone will vanish""Otherwise, this is a very boring disk. After all the excitement of the last fifteen DVDs, this one falls flat on its face and I found myself playing games and reading manga online while watching just to do something entertaining...because I was hoping by watching that I wouldn't miss something important for later. No, nothing in these episodes. Very sleeper. Sure, you can't keep the intensity of a series running on High forever. People get burned out. But, at least make it somewhat...more distracting?"
1,Very bland,"I was expecting a lot form England's No 1 tea. If you like the Black tea Lipton tea bags then you may like this product. I find this one very bland, mild, no taste, no color. The tea in the bags is like powder."
3,ok cooler,"The performance of this cooler is ok but not great..Rather big and clumsy for the small amount of room inside, and it did not seem to cool the contents as well as my last one. Also, must pay attention to how you hook up the wires or it will heat the contents instead of cool. That may be great for keeping something warm, but what a surprise if you are expecting a cold drink!"
4,What a great travel tool.,"My wife and I recently completed a six week, 10,400 mile automobile trip around America. We purchased a Koolatron P95 cooler so that we wouldn't have to bother with ice for the 6 week trip. When we stopped at the end of the day, we brought it inside and plugged it into the 110 adapter (accessory) and kept it cool during the night. In the morning back into the car and plugged into the 12 volt system. We had cold water, sandwich making items, chocolate (not melted) and fruit, mayonnaise and other items we just wouldn't have dared to carry. I would have given it a 5 star rating if it had wheels and a handle making it easier to move when filled. But it is great!"
4,COOL MODEM!!,"I bought a Jornada 525 recently and I started searching for a modem. I am glad I got myself this little gadget. It was very easy to set it up. The step by step instructions can't be better. This is a real plug and play beauty. In less than 10 minutes I was surfing the web. The only downside is that it doesn't have a light indicator when it is connecting or any sound at all. Above all, a great and reliable modem!"
3,Sturdy serenade,"3 1/2Unlike so many other neo-prog units, AC offers something distinctly different, exercising a lengthy, if not epic set of classically trained chops."
3,"Not bad, could be better","I got this stroller a couple of months ago. At the time, the description said that it would hold up to 75 pounds, which is one of the reasons I got it because my son is 3 1/2 and almost 50 pounds already! Unfortunately, when I received it, the box said it only held up to 50 pounds which was a huge bum out. I decided to put it together anyway and test it out. It is actually a decent stroller for the price. He fits in it well, seems comfortable and it doesn't seem like he's pushing the weight limits. It rides smooth and you can lock the front wheel or let it swivel. It was really easy to put together, I did it in like 10 minutes. All in all I'm pretty pleased with it."
5,great stroller,"This is my 3rd and last child shes is 18 mo I bought this stroller recently I love it space below is ok water pack of 24 plus a few extras from the grocery store stears well with front wheel locked she loves it wish i had this with my other two. Man have jogger strollers come a long way. great heighth I am 5'9 my water bottle doesnt tip closed tray holds ipod small wallet and small phone keeps consealed.She seems comfortable. Cries when I take her out she loves it wants to stay in. her tray a little small but will work, cant beat the price."
4,stroller,this is a great stroller. i just wish it would fold up a little better(guess you can't everything).
4,Excellent Resource,"This is an interesting resource book, as it gives strategies such as mnemonics and sayings to help students learn the many words that are not decode-able.The books by Timothy Rasinski are better overall as a series, but this single volume is certainly worth the low price."
5,Brillance is defined as From Dusk Till Dawn the soundtrack,"I love it! It was amazing to see a soundtrack live up to it's movie. This is a must for any serious collector. The music adds a real atmosphere to any room you play it in, and the continual quality is stunning."
4,Great price for a good posing stool!,"This is a decently built posing stool for half the price of those other uncomfortable ""professional"" level posing stools."
2,"Correct item #, but not as described!","The two phillips head screwdrivers are *not* as described. They are supposed to be (from the product description): ""66-565 This item features: -Phillips tips are blasted black oxide."" However, they are just the same as the slotted tips. I double checked the product number, and it is correct. I checked this product from a couple of other places, including Sears, and the picture shows the tips. My packaging is somewhat different, so maybe they sent me an older set, from before they started oxidizing the tips."
2,Tips are cheap quality,These are not the ones shown in the picture. The set in the picture is the old style with hardened tips. I sent these back. Buy the Greenlee or Klein
4,More attention by producers of DVD would be nice,"These are episodes, and not necessarily a complete series on one topic, so it's a little jumpy/incomplete if you watch the whole dvd, but my kid (age 2.5) is too young to notice so far. And it's worth it to have Mr. Rogers back."
3,Saved by Matt Davis,"Sounded like a good story - i suppose it could have been if the characters had acted like most normal people and discussed what was happening to them to their friends and loved ones - but once again the hero of the piece , in this case Harrison French (Matt Davis) decides to do what nobody in real life woud do - go it alone against the odds . Interesting how a corpse laying in the woods for at least 3 days looks so good - just one of my gripes i suppose . The only endearing feature of this movie was the fact the a very good actors like Matt Davis & Jmes Spader were in the movie - take away the eye candy and you don't have much left - rent it - don't buy it !Oh - yeah - what a small town they must have lived in - so many coincidences and chance meetings - maybe that was to make the story more believable - who knows !"
4,A classic pirate tale.,"Iโm not a great fan of reading about violence. This was a classic that kept me interested without being overly horrified. Although our hero was forced into piracy, he is a relatively good pirate whose heart is with his true love."
3,ok,"Track 1 is great, it's the one at the end credit of the movie. The rest is ok but with no signification. Fair..."
1,"Run from it, Broaderbund hasn't discovered Windows",Avoid this product. Broaderbund hasn't done a decent update on this product. I guess they haven't heard of Windows. To boot it or leave it you have to click on one button after another through 2 screens and you can't move between it and other programs. What is with that?Why can't your computer just remember who you are and where you are in the program unless instructed otherwise when you hit the Mavis button? After all it is a computer!I don't know what else is out there but I wouldn't buy this again. Two thumbs down!
1,Get only the Deluxe,"There is practically no substantial difference between version 15 and 16 UNLESS you get the deluxe version of 16. Then you have a few more games. I did find 16 for $4. but had to pay $5 shipping/handling for each copy (even though it came in one package!). They should just put the price at $9. and I wouldn't have been so irritated. Still, don't bother getting version 16 unless you get the Deluxe, IMHO."
1,Okay movie,this was my first time watching a silent movie. it was okay but lon chaney's performance of quasemodo. but that was the only thing i liked about the film. if you have not seen this then i recommend you don't.
4,Great cup has only one flaw.,"I saw this on a cooking show and it got the best review. The only complain I have is that it will leak if turned upside down. The term vacuum should not be used as I view that to be spillproof.That being said, it insulates both hot and cold very well. It also doesn't 'taint' the taste of beverages like some metal lined cups. All in all, I love this cup."
4,"Help with OSCE, clear and concise",This is a useful guide for anyone facing examination by OSCE in their medicine course.
2,What a shame...,"This saw works well, yet less so than other light pullsaws I have (Bear Saw, Shark, etc.). It has a nice, small size which is convenient for tighter spaces, but binds easily. The biggest issue is that replacement blades are hard to find (I haven't found one yet). After the blade wears down there is yet another plastic waste-product to sit forever in a landfill.If you need a very small saw, this one is only ok. If you can do with a larger alternative with replacement blades I would suggest you do so."
1,This is not HIM.... it's an evil imposter,"Any self respecting fan of HIM's earlier music, will be sadly disappointed in their cheap imitation pop rock malarchy. I WAS and I stress WAS a huge fan of this band from their first two albums. Here in the United States their earlier albums were not easy to get, but alas it was done. I turned a lot of my friends on to HIM also.But this album is not the band that I once knew and loved. This is a pop rock version of the coolest love/death rock in the world. I'm not sure who they are trying to appeal to on this album, but as for myself, I am sadly disappointed."
4,Good Stuff!,"It's short but sweet. Highlights isn't my favorite of HIM's CDs but I feel it's definately worth owning. I see Highlights as one of HIM's more mature efforts, though theres nothing childish about them at all :) Beautiful is just that-a beautiful song. Salt in our Wounds is a great track as well, my favorite on the CD."
4,Fresh and simple.,"Its hard to be in a bad mood after you listen to this album. It just makes you want to run outside and play.A great album, probably appreciated more by true fans than the first time listener, its a good 2nd or 3rd album to have in your Samples collection."
5,how can you actually not want to order this.,"whoomp there it is! the samples are awesome. if you love music that touches your soul, touches your life,and touches your heart..then you will love the samples. not only are they awesome lyricists, but talented musicians as well. there are not too many kind words to say about them or too complimenting words to say about their music. if you don't check them out you will be sorry!! it is a kind of reggae..grass roots..acoustic entertainent sound."
3,very beautiful,It really looks good not as big as I thought it would be quite small. But I still enjoyed it and looks really nice.
3,Simple and quirky,"This isn't a series to get hooked on. Its been around a while and was pulled on initial release due to a ratings issue if I remember correctly. Unless Funimation plans to finish the series I would just watch for the first episode and see it as simply a christmas special, anime style."
3,My Santa,"It was cute. Would be willing to show it to friends. Wouldn't pay more than $5 for it though. It's a novel approach to a holiday video. The romatic aspects were done without being blatant or crass. More of an innocent than ""adult"" romance. It was amusing to see all the trouble she got him into without even trying."
4,"Hard to match the first, but a solid compliment here","While the first season of Ah My Goddess! introduced you to the all the characters and their motivations, Flights of Fancy does a very good job to further flesh out these characters and introduces two new ones. However, while the first season generally saw no direct interference with the main protaganists' relationship, the second season directly goes that route to forcefully develop said relationship. While this works as a plot device, it does conflict with some of the clean charm and innocence that made the first season so refreshing. Still much of the fare remains, while all the characters are further developed. A very good follow-up to the first season."
3,Odd. Funny at times. Two interesting main characters.,"This book is an okay novel. It's very weird. That weirdness makes it pretty funny at times.The strange dialogue is a highlight. Not only do characters say very shocking, inappropriate things to authority figures, even the authority figures say shocking, inappropriate things. (Priests, psychiatrists.)The novel doesn't really hold together well. It's split into halves, one for each main character. The two main characters don't interact. Even within a half, the story is episodic; there isn't much of an overall plot, as far as I remember.I think the author should comb through this book looking for interesting pieces to harvest and reuse in some other form. Unfortunately, the publisher might own the copyright. Oh well.This book is more in line with ""The Fly Must Die"" and ""Fever 42"" than with ""Eternal Bliss"" and ""The Lyssa Syndrome.""Disclaimer: It's been a *long* time since I read this book. I'll probably revise this review if I re-read the book."
5,This book still rests in my heart!,"This may not be a the kind of review you're looking for. I read this book in 1988 as an assigned reading in the 6th grade. To be honest, I started off loathing it. It is one of two books I am very grateful that I was assigned to read. It touched my heart and my mind."
2,it was cool,it was bad in a way but it got better. It was a cool book with a lot of things most people would not think of.Yeah!
2,Xi ~ Omega,"The 11'th album and the worst Omega album...I'm a huge fan, but i think this CD is not so good.Too much computer sound and the songs are too uninspired.Buy this CD for your complete Omega collection."
5,The Pagemaster,This is a awesome Soundtrack this soundtrack is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The best songs on this soundtrack are all of them if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
3,HOT MUSIC,"Great sound and great voice, too much repition on the same tune, the entire cd is the same tune, over and over and over."
2,Axles are weak and break often.,"I must agree the ProForm Cardio Cross Trainer series axles are prone to break easily and often. I went through 3 axles at $50+ a piece in a 1-1/2 years, and I am not that heavy. But hey they are cheap and when it is not broken I liked it. I am tired of taking it apart and repairing it though. Only gave it 2 stars because it is cheap. It might be decent if you are very light."
3,900 CardioCross Elliptical,"Since I've never used one before to compare, I gave it 3 stars. I love it. It's smooth and quiet. I keep it in my bedroom, upstairs. You cannot tell that someone is using it unless you are actually in the room. (Even then, it's very smooth and quiet). I could use it while my fiancee sleeps and it would not wake him. I definitely get a good workout too, even using one of the 20 min. programs."
3,so... frustrating...,"grrrr, these guys have so much potential. its obvious that they know how to use their equipment well, because they've come up with some really interesting sounds. the lyrics are cleverly arranged as well as thought-provoking (such as in Jesus Christ Porno Star). its just that the composition seemed at little lacking in excitement. it results in music somewhat slower than i prefer. electric molecular and the ""suck on this"" mix of Exiled were nice tracks, but the rest left me bored (i like industrial bands that put emphasis on the electronic aspect of the genre's sound).good if you like slower industrial, but for those of us speed freaks, we'll have to find our fix elsewhere."
5,Good mouse trap,"I caught one mouse the first time I used it. Very easy to setup. The trap material doesn't seem to be so strong though. The mouse kept biting the cage, and I was afraid that it would escape so I placed the trap inside a tall garbage can just in case it managed to get out the trap. I released the mouse this morning about half mile away from my house. It seemed so happy to get out.I caught another one today. Two days in a row. What a super trap.I just caught another one this morning. It really work!!!!! I hope this will be the last one I caught."
3,Not the same,This product did not have the same scent as the bottle I was still using. Lighter scent and just not a perfect match!! But still ok to use.
3,Vermont American 7in. dado,"First, If you think Vermont American is American, forget it. It's made in China. The hub rubbed when I tryed to mount it. A cheap plastic spacer whasher is included for this(some table saws) but this caused the blade to hit the dado plate cutout. I threw away the spacer and trimmed .050in. off the hub. Then it fit. It cuts well except it tends to tear when exiting work as tooth is about 3/16 wide. The 3/4 groove cuts perfectly square. A good buy for convenience of quickly changing cut widths and price."
5,A must for any music lover,This is one of the best albums I've ever heard. No longer in production so get your hands on a copy of this if you can.
4,nice!,Nice as I expeced! For Japanese the voice is a little bit strange but it's Ok. worth to get it.
2,"Wonderful Film, Poor Subtitles","It pains me to give ""Castle in the Sky"" the rating I did, as it's a wonderful film. However, the subtitling is, well, awful. Even with a limited grasp of Japanese, it's fairly evident to me that the subtitles don't really follow the spoken Japanese dialogue very well, and if the translation of the dubbed version isn't any better, I'd probably not be happy watching this dubbed either.One would think that Disney would be capable of doing a better job of translation and subtitling - I was sorely disappointed with the job they did. On the plus side, the picture and sound quality are very good.A fairer review of this might be 1 star for the subtitling, but 4 stars for the video quality and 4 stars for the film itself."
2,Good Movie but Dub has been changed,"I have loved this movie for years since I first saw it and I was thrilled to recieve it for christmas. Unfortunately, a lot of little changes have been made to the dub which it disappointing. Several lines have been cut, new sounds have been added (particularly at the beginning in the airship), and sound has been changed for the worse. I miss the original orchestrations that underscored this beautiful film!Besides these faults, the film is great for those who have not seen it before, but if you know the movie, you are probably best getting an older copy of the dvd."
4,A very good movie,"Not one of his best, but still better than most. This is actually closer to a 4.5, but that's not available."
3,A little violent for a kids film,"We love My Neighbor Totoro, Howl's Moving Castle, Kiki's Delivery Service, etc, and bought Castle in the Sky thinking it was more gentle family entertainment. It opens with a graphic gun battle, and continues with one violent confrontation after another before the big fight at the finish. We shut it off twenty minutes in, sent the kids to bed, and my wife and I watched the rest. Beautiful imagery as always (I'm a pilot and admire Studio Ghibli's always loving take on aviation), and a complex and absorbing story, but way too violent for young kids."
5,Praying they remaster Totoro like this,"First off this is one of the best picture quality movies. I had bought mine for $40 and was edgy to do so. So happy i did, the sound is clear and they returned in Mr. Hiasha orignal score! The extra dialouge was cut and it is classic in the Anime world. Like the top says lets pray they do the same for totoros release. Second, the film ware over time is fixed and the color that previously looked faded is brighter, to the point where there bair went from being redish brown to very dark brownish black. Its a solid A+ transfer and bless Miyazaka for this film!!!"
5,Castle in the Sky: One of the Finest Animes I've Ever Seen,"First off let me begin by saying how much I have enjoyed Anime. Particularly Hayao Miyazaki's work. I have seen many titles over the years however, this one wins. I sincerely hope that it is given the proper advertizing over here. I have been waiting for this to come out for a while in the US and a speedy release would be appreciated. Especially on biligual DVD. (dubbed and subbed in english). If only for the voice acting to say the least. For example James Van der Beek does an excellent job as Pazu (which in case you were not aware is pronounced ""pot-zu"") and Anna Paquin does a good job herself as Sheeta.(PS for the Spanish speakers don't brush this off because of the Island's name it's purely coincidental). In conclusion I truly reccommend this to fans of Animation of all ages. Thanks."
4,Beautiful film by Miyazaki,"Miyazaki's ""Warriors of the Wind"" was one my first anime film experiences; it was amazing. Watching Castle in the Sky rekindled that experience. Miyaziki's style and rich, breathtaking animations draw you in to the world of Laputa, this movie is simply stunning.Castle in the Sky is also a great adventure story that will appeal to anyone who likes a good movie, kids will love this one. This is the type of cell animation that Disney should be making today."
1,Horrible Movie,"Not only is this movie childish and predictable, it's also very boring. The characters are unrealistic. The girl had some sort of weird accent. It was like a mix of Britain and U.S. accents. Very annoying. The two main characters had little depth, and I didn't care what happened to them in the end. The graphics weren't very good either. I don't like the way the people were drawn, and the colors in most of the movie were dull and gray. I didn't like how Dola and Pops looked and sounded like chararacters from Spirited Away. Some of the same music was used too. Spirited Away is a much better movie, though. I would highly recommend that you buy Spirited Away instead of Castle in the Sky."
2,Get the 2003 Version.,Get the 2003 version if you love the movie. This new edition is only good for bonus feature lovers. The movie has a Dubtitles.
4,Flying Anime Adventure...,"Castle in the Sky is a film about adventure, coming of age, love, greed, power, and much more. This mixture of sub plots brings about a marvelous tale about a young girl's escape from greedy pirates and corrupt authority with the help of a young boy and his dreams. As the story unfolds more magical and fantastic details are disclosed through the amazing ventures of the two youngsters who are forced to take up a struggle against evil. This is a surprisingly good story that offers several lessons for those who seek wisdom and provides an escape for those who need to leave the boredom of reality."
4,"Good Job, Miyazaki-sensei","This movie was excellent. If you want something to show to your kids but you also want something to enjoy yourself, this movie would be a good pick. The artwork and storyline is beautiful. The dubbing is great. The subbing could have been better...but then, it could have been worse. Disney did a good job. I'm impressed with the work and I love the movie. It is a must buy."
3,Not Troma but worth a single viewing,Dobn't let the Sgt. Kabukiman fool you. These are older B comedies with a slight amount of nudity that are worth watching once given the stars such as Shelly Wninters. But don't think you are getting top run or Troma classic gore.
5,I received this movie on time and I really like this movie,"I had not problems ordering or receiving this movie. I love this movie because it shows how much someone could give their life for a family member, if they had to. Great movie"
4,Against a Crooked Sky,"I saw this movie when I was a child and I still remember it! Sure, it's dated, but it certainly had a message about the strength of will that had an impact. It would be a great movei for a family with young kids!"
3,Movie,The delivery was slow. This was a Christmas present and it did not arrive until after Christmas.
4,Against a Crooked Sky,This was a gift for our Granddaughter for her 7th birthday but my wife and I previewed it on line beforehand. Looking over I saw tears in my wife eyes. An adult could almost predict the outcome but the grand kids were spellbound throughout. I feel it was a very good movie for the children 7 - 12 years old
1,Not like watching the original.,With all the technology of today it would had been nice to see this priceless touching film without feeling you are watching a old elementary reel tape. Too bad. I am sorry I bought. The quality was awfull.
1,Junk box,"I bought it less then year ago, and now it is in garbage. It is totally unreliable. If you ask ""Why?"" - because it was made in Malaysia. No metal parts inside - plastics only! Any small part could be easily broken, and after that the box is dead. I also have TV set from Panasonic, and it is another candidate to be thrown away. ""No more!"" to Panasonic!"
4,For the price it is a 5 star,"I have had many stethoscopes in my life, for the price this one is great ... not on the same level as a Littman Cardiology III, but a decent stethoscope for everyday nursing, can hear the lung sounds, heart sounds and bowel sounds on adults clearly and that is all I need."
5,Great product!,I bought this rechargeable flashlight/lantern to replace a Craftsman and find it to be a great product. There's not much difference between the two and it is working just fine for me.
1,A Disappointment,I used this lantern quite a bit until the bulb burned out. It takes a Xenon 6 volt .975 amp bulb. Dorcy has them listed on their website in packs of two for $5.00. The problem is that they sent a single 40 lumen LED replacement that performs miserably. I discarded the lantern and would not consider purchasing another Dorcy product.
2,Disappointed,"Based on all of the customer reviews I read before purchasing ""Tibitz"", I had high expectations. Upon reading the book for the first time, I was very disappointed. Reading it a second time left me thinking this book is maybe worth a 2 1/2. The concept of a land with no lies is indeed charming. The poem/story sets up in the young reader's imagination a simple yet heart-warming land to live in. Where the book fails is to teach any lesson. I expected to show my child what can happen if you lie, and how it can hurt trust between people,etc. I can expand on that myself, of course. But then, I could have done that without purchasing this book."
3,Memory Jogger,Needed a refresher in finandial analysis. Formulas don't change. The book was in good shape.
2,Wrong size/different from advertised/3 year old picture,"3.5"" was claimed but it was actually a larger 3.75"" in diameter size so it won't fit on the 3.5"" inner diameter hole that I have for the cleanout canister for the tub. Also, the picture was 3 years old, I found out from the manufacturer. Had to return it and buy another one from another supplier that the manufacturer recommended, that had the ability to supply one that fits better, namely a Sioux Chief 882-EB320 that has a diameter for 3.378"" which is closer to the 3.5"" specification I need.3.5"" Clean Test Plug"
5,Angelina Jolie burns in Foxfire,Jolie is such a fox in this movie (no pun intended). She is such a great actress not to mention she is hot. This is a great movie but escially for any Jolie fan .
5,Like fire...,"This film burns the screen with power, sensitivity, unbreakable bonds and emotional connections that will blow your mind. Jolie and Burress shine in Foxfire in a way that you'll never forget. Every woman has been a girl, and, even if they store their feelings deep inside, they have to wish they had spent a few months like these girls. I know I do. But even guys have to relate to the realistic rebellious and connected spirit these girls reflect on-screen. Every character is well-developed. I wish I could change the ending of the movie, but that ending is what keeps things real. This movie is definitely a treasure."
4,Awesome Littel Jewel...,I actually really like this I'm only on lesson 1 but all of what I learned has stuck. It's easy to understand the speaker which can be harder with a lot of language programs and it's CONSTANT REPEATING which keeps you practicing
3,Pretty good,"am a huge Eurythmics fan but this live cd could be much better. Annie sings beautifully but there are so many songs they could have put on it that were rarely heard by them live, plus the art work is boring. It couldv'e been much better."
1,Panasonic Digital Camera Poor Quality,"This is the worst digital camera I have ever owned! The night pictures are terrible especially of dark clothing. The Macro Zoom is very poor. PANASONIC should stick to VCR's and TV's! Very Poor Quality! I called Panasonic and they couldn't tell me the problem. Neither tech could answer my questions and on the rude side also. I like Panasonic products but the camera doesn't deserve one star. If you want a good quality digital camera, don't buy Panasonic!! Most of the pictures are not clear. The colors aren't true. I wish I had listened to a bad review I had read of this camera previously!Sheila"
1,The only good thing is Emily Longstreth,"I wanted to see this movie to see Emily longstreth,but the movie was realy bad,is probably the worst movie where she had a leading role.Wired to kill was a lot better than this and never maded to dvd and Emily had a leading role in that one as well.By the way someone knows what Emily is doing now,i havent hear from her in years."
4,"Great functional product, great price","A dependable, functional tool for the outdoors, made in the USA and guaranteed for life. Have the eyelet for a lanyard is a great idea. though the included elastic cord will likely need replacing with something more sturdy. The eyelet itself seems as if it could be pulled easily from hinge if it were tugged tightly, though that too would be an easy fix. Very happy with this."
3,Dazzling Encyclopedic Work,"As an Israeli Jew who is the son of American olim, I have been raised both very left wing and ardently Zionist. I do not disagree with the vast majority of the actions of the IDF during the War of Independence. However, this book, regardless of what happened in that war, I found incredibly interesting. Benny Morris, whom I respect, said it was a ""dazzling encylcopedic"" work. And Mr. Morris was exactly right. The book contains all sorts of interesting information about the villages that we Israelis tend to forget ever existed. If only Mr. Khalidi discussed the Jewish communities that were also fled or if he addressed the Arab villages that were depopulated BEFORE the War of Independence even started. Or perhaps something about those villages that are still there. Even if it is a little biased, I think that we Zionists should look past that and discover the tremendous volume of truly interesting information that lies in this book."
4,Sultry Country,"This is the first CD I've seen of hers but I really liked it. Her ""Dozen Red Roses"" number will leave you with a tear in your eye and a tug at your heart. On ""Cool water"" Tammys' sexy voice paints the most vivid picture of hot summer, hot romance and being with the one person that makes you feel like there's no one else in the world but you two. Tammy ends the CD with one of the best cuts,""Houdini"". This number brings foot stomping, keyboard rocking excitement in a honkytonk style not unlike the great Jerry Lee Lewis himself! I can't wait to hear whats next!"
4,An Oldie But A Goodie,"Early Fifties mono sound but despite that, the third and last ""pressing"" I've purchased(1st CD). Christoff has been matched, but for me, never bettered by others (Marti Talvela, again with Nicolai Gedda, is my current overall favorite). Conductor Issay Dobrowen finds that ""horses of the invaders"" pace in the music that no one since has quite captured. Should probably not be your first (it was my first 50 years ago)or one and only recording, but a classic that everyone who likes the opera should experience."
5,Absolutely one of my ESSENTIAL CDS--Awesome!!,"I actually heard this CD and Robert Cray for the first time several months ago and I instantly fell in love. It is rare that you pop in a CD and LOVE EVERY SONG, but I did. I have since tried to get my hands on all of his other albums, but I truly believe that this is the absolute BEST! There is just nothing like it...blues, jazz, funk, soul...it is all there and that amazing voice. Thanks Mr. Robert Cray. I love you!!"
1,Definatly not the best.,This was a very poor baby name book. Looked like something a 2nd grader would read. Was not impressed at all.
4,"Not bad, but crashes...","I could re-build our house and try out different furniture, etc. Only problem is that changing the floor crashes the program and I have to restart. Bummer. Otherwise it is great."
1,Big disappointment!,"After years of using the previous 3D Architects, with great success, I assumed version 6 was, as they offered, an upgrade. Wrong! It's a completely new program without the ability to import files from early versions. A real let down since I often go back to older files for designs. Futhermore, getting support is a joke. You just get the run around with the automated services. This will be the last Broderbund software I buy. After all, if they do it to 3D, why not Print Shop, or one of the others?"
3,Home Design Deluxe 6,"I like all the different furnishings, but I found it difficult to work with the viewing tools. I couldn't figure out how to look inside the house I was building."
5,once you pick it up you can't put it down,"this book is rich in historical value and vivid characters. After the first book, this came as a refreshing surprise. It definately shows you the inside scoop of World War One and how the Fountain of Light persuaded and blinded its many followers."
1,Check your US Codes?,Why would anyone send a DVD to someone in Texas that only works in DVD players in Canada and the UK? I have never bought anything from Amazon that I had to check the codes on to make sure it works in the USA. --ridiculous
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,This is such a funny classic movie you can watch over and over. We get it out every year and watch it.
4,John Candy Gem!,This is an old favorite! A true John Candy Gem!!Good family movie full of laughs and John Candy humor!!!
3,Too many edited scenes,"There were too many edited scenes that made this purchase a non value.1. When driving to the beach, an edited car scene.2. When arriving at the first beach house, an edited upstairs foyer scene.3. When in the first beach house, the dog chewing on the sofa leg and the collapse of the sofa.4. The fabulous boobs scene.All these scenes were cut out, and when combined, they only add a minute or so longer to the movie."
1,Odds are that you recive a dude battery!,"Since they have no QUALITY CONTROL, the PRODUCT IS SO CHEAP, and YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THE RETURN EXPENSES, you probably end up spending more than if you buy an original Sony brand. That happens to me who live abroad and bought a piece of junk! It's like a lottery! And the risk is all yours! HIGLY NOT RECOMMENDED."
5,Great Series,"I had wanted this DVD for a while, and it did not disappoint. I recommend buying the whole series. Seasons 4-5 are very strong, helped by a great cast and special guests."
1,A Disgrace,"I really tried to like this but it is so overtly sexual it is actually degrading and disgusting, but with today's world it is probably seen as wonderfully funny and even relevant. If you are in your right mind-spirit at all you will not like this or even make excuses for it. Don't waste your money on this product. It will be interesting to know what happen to the people involved in this production especially the writer. I threw it in the garbage."
1,Kindle edition,"DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE VERSION. It is not stereoscopic. Poor low resolution images. Very disappointing on an iPad. The book very good. Kindle is not ready for prime time. I would rate it at zero stars, that was not an option!"
5,you'll love it,"Tumbling is one of the best books that I've read in the last couple of years! The author had a way of making the reader believe the unbelievable. The characters in the book seemed as if they could be my next door neighbors: they were funny, caring, but above all else they had real life obstacles to overcome. Most importantly I think this book shows that there is no barrier in life too great to overcome."
5,A book to be read a second time and more!!!!,"I read books once and file them away in my library. However, Tumbling is a book that I can and will read again and again over the years. I knew the characters, Herbie and Moon and their children and all the others. My gut felt their struggles and rejoiced with their victories. The language was beautiful w/out being overly flowery. Simply: I LOVED the book. I recommend it to one and all. It can be on my Book-of-the-Month-Club"
4,Sweet movie,"I thought Small Change was a delightful film. It is dated 1976 so late baby boomers and early Gen Xer's might really like it. Especially if they remember their childhoods well. I felt Francois Truffaut enjoyed being a child and likes children. That he remembered those little details and feelings so well from his past. Good and bad. I'm one of those people too. I am constantly surprised how few people can remember anything before 12. Or if they do, so few memories. So sad."
3,Small Change,"While this movie provides what I look for in most foreign films - an insight into living life with the subtle differences that make living in another country unique - it's story is a bit plodding without an explanation for the camera's interest until the end. And, that is also a bit of a let down. Watch it if you have a desire to experience public school and low level juvenile delinquency in Europe but don't expect to be drawn into it enough to give a damn about any or the characters."
5,Great Timing,"My husband saw part of this show on TV, but wanted to see the whole thing. He was delighted when amazon.com sent it to me so quickly."
2,Its just OK.,I have listened to this CD at least ten times all the way through. It just hasn't grown on me! Robbies voice is boring and sounds constipated (for lack of a better word)!! The music is good but the vocals take away from it.
4,Inspirational,"The most interesting thing about this book is that the reader sees several points of view, and is usually able to relate to at least one. (I'm Rita and Jen) This book will inspire the reader, and will, if she/he already isn't, excite them about sports."
3,Not much basketball in this book.,"This book is filled with the most mundane details about each girl on the team, the town and people of Amherst and surrounding towns, local history, Emily Dickinson, the evolution of women's sports, etc., but it provides very little text about basketball itself. It devotes only a few pages in the whole book to describing anything that actually occurred during a basketball game. I read it with my 13 year old daughter, who is developing an interest in basketball, and it was a bit tedious for us both."
1,A low on Belmondo's carrer,"It is a waste to have Belmondo on such a film. Even after the film is over we are still asking what was the point...It is not funny, has no meaning, trips from one cliche to another, and wastes our time. At least Belmondo got paid to do this film. We should be paid for to watch it!"
2,Wanted to like But very disappointed,"I really wanted to like this book. Interesting information, the use of actual events to bring the history alive, and an easy writing style are all in its favor. But I can't get around the authors constant politicalization of events and decisions - esp. as he relates more modern history. It becomes VERY obvious that the author has a bias against certain people and their decisions (ok, we all do, that's fine) but when relating the chronology and facts about a battle or a fire fight that is not the place to beat the reader over the head with your views. Makes it difficult to keep reading - I've had the book for 6 months and have still not finished it."
5,Used for a class,"I had to order this book for one of my classes, I found that it was very easy to understand and covered the information well."
2,Love Story,"It is a nice story but, it should be rated R for language and sex scenes.It is not a family movie."
5,Old School Classic,This film was a reawakening of my youth. One of the most powerful examples of love shared and lost. Very emotional and moving. Excellent in content.
3,very emotional,"I thought Love Story was one of the greatest movies of all time.My favorite line was ""Love means never having to say your sorry""If you have never seen this movie you don't know what your missing!!!!!"
3,Where do I begin?,"What a blockbuster this film was---most people under 30 would never know, care or remember--A perfect slice of 1970/71 era cinema--SUGGESTION:If the plot, dialoge and story tend to bore you...one can always turn off the sound and quietly behold the lovely Ali MacGraw--!! That's reason enough to give this one a try"
2,Don't buy this book,"I was totally disappointed with Fondue It! I expected a jumping off point closer to traditional fondue, but instead, the majority of the book deals with elaborate recipes -- spring rolls, grilled polenta -- that are better suited to kitchen preparation, not around the fondue pot, with full guest interaction. Also, the book was laid out in an amateurish, hard to follow way. It was really not what I, as an experienced cook but a beginner at home fondue, was looking for."
2,forgettable,Shadow Music Album is not a favorable buy if you are looking for quality music. Only 'Shadow' song is good rest are forgettable. Music by Anand Raj Anand is different certainly but it lacks that heart winning touch.
5,Perfect,I am a language arts teacher and love using this for a fun opening to parts of speech. Great experience!!
3,Mekissa and Doug Standard Poodle Plush,"Not as durable as described, but a beautiful stuffed animal! Very lifelike!Vinnie, our big standard loves it. Worth buying for the enjoyment it gave him."
3,"OK, but not great","Buyers beware. The Porky Pig Blue Christmas song which is on this cd is NOT the version you've probably heard on the radio, or listened to on youtube (the one with the woman laughing hysterically in the backround). That was a bit of a letdown for me. The Mad Max On Christmas segment more than made up for it, however. If you want the original Porky Pig Blue Christmas, it can be found on various download sites under the name ""Seymour Swine and the Squealers""."
2,Not a very good book on Palmistry,"I've been a serious student of cheiromancy for some 40 years now. I've read just about every book that's come down the pike. This book isn't very good and it certainly is no ""Bible.""If marketed as a beginners guide, it would be more appropriate. This book covers only the basic variations of lines you will find in the palm with too many broad generalizations.What I think is really misleading is that this book is supposed to be designed for someone who wants to read palms for a living! I would run from anyone who charged me if this book was the only source of their knowledge."
5,Very nice rashguard for the price,"I really liked the fit and feel of this rashguard. While you do need to order one size up for a good fit - I ordered an XL although I am 42 in the chest (theoretically a Large) and its form -fitting still - its a great deal at Amazon. Its one of the best prices around, and the garment itself is well-made and pretty cool looking. My kids describe it as my Super-Hero costume (!). I ordered a Pinnacle rash guard from a different source for about the same price (on sale, then paid for shipping and return shipping...) and the fit, fabric etc were inferior to this one. I would highly recommend this shirt as a great buy."
3,An otherwise great album flawed by one of the stupidest songs ever made,"Hailed as one of the pioneering works of the techno-rave movement, this album is a mostly solid set of fierce beats and wailing background vocals that generally do make it one of the major cornerstones of its subgenre. It's always bothered me, however, that the big hit here was ""James Brown Is Dead."" Between Brown still being alive at the time and that the song is not meant to be silly or comical, it kind of comes across as a mean-spirited jab at one of the great music legends of the 20th century (and which understandably prompted another techno outfit to release a song entitled ""James Brown Is Still Alive"" that same year). Not sure what the point of it was, but if you can get past it, the rest of the album is some great techno-rave that more than makes up for it."
5,"""A Smaller But Impressive Edition""","In 1998 David Leddickโs โThe Male Nudeโ was published by Taschen. Now in this edition called โMale Nudesโ Taschen has published a much smaller version of the original book with the very best and most impressive images in a wonderful and very affordable paperback. I was very impressed with this edition. Itโs a great introduction to the history of male nude photography from the 1850โs to the present day. Itโs a fascinating look at the changes the male nude has experienced in body type, structure, and sexual content over the past 100 years. There are images from almost every photographer you can think of during this time period. The quality & printing of this book is excellent.This is a must for anyone who appreciates & admires the male body and wishes to know the history of male nude photography. Make sure you get a copy of this before itโs too late. Highly Recommended!"
4,AAAaaaaahhhhh....,This is exactly what I was looking for! It was hard finding a moist heating pad specifically for the shoulder/lower neck area. The only thing I would change or modify later is to have a greater range of adjustment on the velcro closure.
5,Best Heating Pad,"This is the third one I have bought. They are wonderful for back pain. Don't understand how, but it truly is moist heat. I highly recommend it for anyone with lower back pain. I like that it has a timer so I can put it on and forget about it. Heavier than standard heat pads and I just throw the cover in the washer and dryer."
3,Needs way to control heating areas,"The front flaps are too long and when you are trying to get heat to your shoulders and neck, your chest area cooks!!!It should have a way to control different ""sections."" It is good for the back but the neck area doesn't get much heat because of the flat ""u"" shape it has.If all you need is heating in the upper back and shoulders (and you have a big back where the flaps won't hang so low) then it's great.Also it's confusing to use the timer portion of it."
4,Excellent for the money,"I love my heat super hot and this product delivers. Heat is even over the entire product. Digital controls are easy to navigate. The downside was mentioned in the other reviews: no back lighting on the display so you have to have to turn the light on the change settings. Also, as mentioned, the heat temp does not seem to coincide with the actual temp but once you adapt to the sensitivity, it's easy to manage.The fact that I needed and got this in a few days, I would recommend this to a prospective buyer."
4,Review,It is a great product but only problem is that it gets cold quickly. If you set the temperature on 130 degree and it will heat up quickly but instead of keeping the same heat it gets cold slowly itself which should not have been.
3,below what was expected,"This heating pad apparently was not tried on before they mass marketed it - It is very cumbersome. Also, does not get hot, it gets warm but not hot. What is cool is you can unplug the cord from the pad and still wear the pad. What is not cool is the heat control switch is placed a few inches down from where it connects to the pad and it's weight pulls the pad to a skewed position. I recommend NOT buying this pad if you are looking for functional convenience. (Like wearing it at your computer at work.)"
4,I can't do without mine!,"In my opinion, these are the best! I have fibromyagia and arthritis--the warm, moist heat feels so good! The only problem I have is they don't seem to last very long. I don't know if this is due to having them wrapped around your back, then sitting on them for low back pain. Mine gets a lot of use in many different areas and bent a lot. I still order another one as soon as one dies. You can't beat this for how good it makes those cramped up muscles feel!"
4,Feels great,This is a great heating pad. I just wish it would take batteries as well. The temp. stays great; I use it everyday as I'm a new mom and trying to recover from a C-Section.
4,Great pad...but it's heavy.,"You really need to decide what issues are important to you when purchasing a heating pad. This pad heats up real high, quickly.. and then cools down to a comfortable level. This is the ""burst of heat"" described in some reviews. Another consideration is that it is HEAVY...those porcelain dots add lots of weight. For someone with heavy duty arthritis...this could be an issue. The cord is nice and long, but the controller is dumb.... Do I need to ""lock it"" or just let it run??? Don't get why there is a ""lock"" feature at all. It also says NOT to lay on it....what the heck? What if you want to put it on your back and are unable to lay on your stomach? I still do it...lay on it I mean.On the plus side...the size is WONDERFUL...and it really feels good. Despite the weight, I think this is a great pad and would recommend it highly. The only reason for 4 stars is the weight."
5,Terrific Heating Pad,"This heating pad is kind of expensive, but well worth the money. It heats to a high heat when turned up and actually does deliver the moist heat that it claims it will. We are very happy with this product."
5,"The best heating pad on the market, and the best price and delivery as always with Amazon!","Bar none, if you use this heating pad you will never use any other brand period! The best ever. I am on my 3rd one in about 12 years, I can not live without it! The new larger digital controller is much more user friendly, and easy to see. I am going to purchase another for my mother who suffers from a bad hip, it will help her greatly to have this heating pad. Amazon has the best price, and yes I did compare. Delivery was prompt and well packaged. Thanks!"
2,Not worth the price.,I bought this for my son so he could see some oldies and when we open it there is only 6 cartoons per dvd. I enjoy the cartoons that are on them just figured there were a lot more.
1,For Shame....Time/Warner!,This Set Is Flat Out Awful!...............Stick With The 60's Series Till Time Warner Quit's Putting Pre-Released Episodes On This Series........Which May Flop Anyway Since No One At Time/Warner Has A Frigging Clue On Compiling Sets Of Toons From 50 Years Ago....It's A Quick Buck Project!Time/Warner You Suck!
1,Still have not receive the BOOK!,My daughter still has not receive this book. Do not order ANYTHING from gohastings. They have not responded to my email for a refund or the book. My daughter received book #4 BEFORE this book actually within 2-4 days (it was thru a different company)!
5,very good,"I think this book was great.I've read all the books exept the last one and I think John Marsden is a great author,you get caught in the book.Question:Why does it have different names in Australien and U.S.In Sweden it's name are the third day's cold(tredje dagens kyla)"
2,too much highlighting,"From the outside, the book appeared to be in great condition, but when I opened it, it was full of highlighting on almost every line of every page. I guess I will not be able to sell it back at a reasonable price. Had I known that it was full of highligting, I probably would not have purchased it."
3,JJ's,This was not good for me as the product was not deliver on time and also was missing the strips... Then I had to get the missing parts from out side.
3,Included With Product,The following I sent to Customer ServiceA main reason I ordered this product was the description detailProduct Desription detail.Accu-chek Aviva Diabetes Monitoring Meter Plus 50 Aviva Test Strips and Free Multiclix Lancet 102 Pack.. Meter 50 Strips and Lancets Aviva Meter Aviva Strips Multiclix Lancet All in one accu chek kit with suppliesNO TEST STRIPS OR LANCETS PROVIDEDThe shipment did include 12 lancets only. Another buyer commented that this was the case with her shipment but I thought it was her shipment error.Buying online I depend on honest and correct product descriptions. I feel I have been mislead in making my decision to buy this product. I have no problem with the monitor and I by chance ordered an extra 50 test strips.Please correct this product's description.If this was an order for flatware and came with a few less forks that's one thing but this is a medical device we are talking about.
5,scary but insightful,"I got this book for a class, one of the authors is a professor at my school, it was very insightful and warns of the dangers of extremism in this country! The KKK has evolved people; not just white sheets but paramilitary."
3,Attila's Leadership,Very well written. Great learning literature. This book has helped me in the work place as well as in my personal life.
4,Great Leadership Reference,"This book is a very easy, relatively entertaining read. You should read it through at least once. After that, it is a great ""quick reference"" guide for those in, or aspiring to be in, leadership positions. The format contains a lot of bullet points which make for easy reference. I keep mine on the shelf and look back at it periodically."
3,A great leader who's lifestyle exceeded his era !,"I thought this book used history in a entertaining form to keep my interest not only on how Atilla thought, but the lifestyles to live or succeed in 454 AD. Great book for history buffs who may seek a management refresher course."
4,Excellent Single,"This is a good record, mainly because ""Deception"" is an amazing song. ""Everywhere at Once"" is also nice, but track 1 will stay in your head for a while. Blackalicious does a good job including hooks and melody, which one does not always find in hip-hop, plus I like the piano."
4,Calm Down Guys,"First of all I would like to say that this is indeed a great album. Giving it five stars, however, may be going too far. The production is good, the songs are very good, the lyrics are a tad weak. This album seems to fit in the category ""If no one knows what the heck I am talking about, they will think it is profound."" Definitely an album worth checking out...defenitely not a five star album."
5,Got you covered!,"I dont understand other reviewers complaints on where's The Herculoids, where's Quick Draw. Its on the freakin discs!! Some cartoons dont play automatically on continued playlist, and are located in special section where you choose each cartoon individually on menu, along with Saturday Morning Cartoon Time announcements and promos. Sheesh. Totally satisfied with this product, and love these retro cartoon dvd collections. On to Volume 2 now!"
4,texas music,"i haven't heard all this album, but if it is Radney Foster, you can bet it is good. The proof is in the songs. The Kinleys, Keith Urban and the Dixie Chicks have all recorded songs off of this album. The only bad part is that his versions seem to get no radio play while the other versions do."
5,Jacob Have I Loved,"Jacob Have I Love was a very intellegent book. It was very realistice. At times it gets confussing, but after awhile it all comes togethger. The book is sad at parts, I feel sorry for ""Weeze."" She seemed so lonley. I liked the ending, it proved that people really do get good things, no matter what they have done."
1,Still NOT Made in USA (Made in China),"The set of nutdrivers I received were black in color and were made in China. Not worth the hassle of sending back. Will use until they inevitably strip, crack, or break, and then will search for some Made in USA nutdrivers."
3,"One of the least known SNL spin offs, but one of the best","This is one of the least known SNL spin offs, but also probably one of the bests. It's not only hilarious, but it's a also a good drama. This is the first for a SNL dramedy. Al Franken is a hilarious and the whole cast is great as a totally dysfunctional family. I loved this movie, I always will. I can never get sick of this one. You have to see this one."
3,Funny- if you have nothing better to do,"This was a funny movie. Probably not one of the funniest SNL movies, but better than SUPERSTAR. It would have been even better if Al Franken had not become AL FRANKEN since it came out. Even with his real life aside, it still made me laugh and I applaud his performance."
1,A Frustrated Reader from Jersey,"One assumes that Goff intended this travesty of a book to provide a history of white gospel singing. But, while constantly referring to white and black gospel as distinctive forms, he never establishes exactly what the differences are. He instead pelts readers with a flurry of boring mini-biographies and social-conservative propaganda. The reader gets a strong sense that Goff disapproves of atheists, homosexuality and abortion, but if the book was supposed to give a definitive account of a musical tradition, it fails."
4,Crown City on New Radio Station www.iM4radio.com,"I heard this cd by accident at a local record store in Rockville, MD and I simply flipped out off of the musical arrangment and lyrical dexterity that the Crown City Rockers exude. Why does good music never get the exposure it so deserves on FM Radio? I probably would have never witnessed these guys if I did not stumble upon them by mistake. If you like groups such as Crown City Rockers, Greyboy, The Roots, Talib Kweli, Erykah Badu, Goapele and so forth then check out the Ultimate Radio Station www.iM4radio.com ""iNfinite gRoove"" with DJ Cleveland 2-4pm (est) M-F. It's Free! Enjoy Yourself."
2,Pure Terror-Pure Junk,Save your money the quality of the audio and video was poor.Only a few good movies. The outer case and booklet were more interesting then most of these movies...
3,Mix of Public Domain and Crown Intl,"I'm hooked on Mill Creek's great 50 packs. As others have pointed out, this set has some duplication with previous Mill Creek sets. Let me add two more cautions:* These are 12 single-sided discs, not double-sided. Easier to handle, but probably more compressed.* This set contains mostly public domain movies, but at least seven are copyrighted by Crown International Pictures. Looks like Don't Answer the Phone! (1980), Double Exposure (1983), My Mom's a Werewolf (1989), Point of Terror (1973), Satan's Slave (1976), Terror in the Jungle (1968), and They Saved Hitler's Brain (1963) are Crown products. There may be more; the box shows 11 copyright dates for Crown. If you like to use movie clips for mashups or other fun stuff, hands off of these.Mind you, I'm happy to get a copy of They Saved Hitler's Brain to watch. I just wish Mill Creek had more prominently labeled which movies are copyrighted and which ones are up for grabs."
3,Should be called Pure Terrible .,"Wow , where do I start . First off I'd like to say thank you Mill Creek for the packaging , this set comes in a heavy duty dvd case inside is a booklet with a description of the movies on each disc , each disc includes a list of the movies on it and they're all in seperate paper sleeves which is far better ( to me ) than those awful spindle packs .That being said . The movies are a mish mash of low budget flicks from the 60's and 70's and range in quality from bad to ""I'd rather take a poke in the eye with a sharp stick "" .All is not lost though . There's a lot of cheesy , campy fun in here but not many scares . A real campy gem is 'The undertaker and his pals ' , it's low budget hilarity . If you're looking for good creepy horror flicks ,like myself , we'll have to keep searching .. Pure Terror is okay , just don't get your hopes up ."
2,Not what I thought,"Package says ""Heavy Duty"", but this tape wasn't at all strong enough. Didn't adhere well to some plastics, and it let loose when I thought it shouldn't. I'll look for a different solution."
1,Cracked like chalk before first use!! Deserves 0 Stars.,"What can I say about a product supposedly made of steel that quite literally breaks in half when taken out of its box?I was going to use for the first time and was ready to asemble it, when I noticed that the two large sides sides had separated. It turns out the ""metal"" hinge between them had snapped right down the middle. The exposed surfaces had the texture of broken chalk and, obviously, this thing is just as brittle. Since I didn't exert any force on this thing and since I didn't hear any popping or cracking sound. I can only assume that it was package broken. I'm getting my money back."
2,Hinge cracked in half,"Well, just like another reviewer here, the hinge on my taper jig cracked right in half. This is a cheaply made tool. I didn't find any particular problems with safety or cut quality, but just made cheaply.Look elsewhere."
3,"Average anime, may be more fun for true aficionados","Having seen the first volume of this collection of a Japanese television anime series, I can honestly say that it's not for me *personally* but I can appreciate that others may find it extremely worthwhile. It's a subject matter that I like-- superheroes who can be mercenaries for hire-- and in a way it reminds me of the popular TV show ""Heroes"", but there is that unique Japanese sensibility to it that is engaging and interesting. At first I found the storyline incomprehensible. It wasn't until episode 3 that I really started understanding what was going on. I love graphic novels and the like, but for my own tastes there is something missing here. Nevertheless, it's an intriguing concept. True anime fans may enjoy this a great deal."
4,"Fairly Good, but I'm No Expert","I thought this was fairly good but please note I don't have a lot of experience viewing anime. The story line held my interest, I thought the characters were good, and the technical aspects seemed decent, but again, not a lot of experience."
3,I don't think I get it,"I'm fairly new to the anime genre, with my only real exposure to it coming several years ago. As such, I wanted to try this out when I saw it available on Amazon Vine.From what I can tell, this is fairly typical of the genre -- low-budget animation that's down and dirty with a rough, gritty style. Although the subject matter -- involving superheroes, mercenaries and lots of action -- is the kind of thing I like, this show left me cold.I'm sure fans of the genre will have a greater appreciation for it. But it just didn't work for me."
2,Grizzly impulse sealer,"For the first half hour of use the sealer worked great, then it suddenly stopped working. We tried speaking with Grizzly's tech support team, whose only advice was to turn it off for a half hour then back on (we had already tried that). In desperate attempts at troubleshooting on our own, we discovered that it would work intermittently, then found that this was due to a rod in the hinge slipping out of place and somehow not allowing the circuit to complete. A few whacks with a hammer and tugs with pliers moved the rod back into place, and we were merrily sealing our cookie bags once again."
5,FAN-tastic,"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT DOCOMENTATION OF HIP HOP'S EARLY YEARS-LIVE. IT INCLUDES MANY COLLECTABLES LIKE DOUGIE FRESH AND SLICK RICK B4 THE RELEASE OF THEIR CLASSIC 12"". IT ALSO INCLUDES THE ORIGINAL BOOGIE DOWN PRODUCTIONS FIRST PERFORMANCE OF THE BRIDGE IS OVER. HIGHLIGHTS CONTINUE WITH THE IMFAMOUS KOOL MOE DEE-BUSY BEE BATTLE. BIG DADDY KANE & BIZ APPEAR IN A RARE IMPROMPTU. THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR THE TRUE HIP HOP HISTORIAN."
1,Looked 50 Pounds Heavier,"Okay, so maybe 50 pounds is a slight exageration but these jeans definately made me look chunky and figure-less. They did nothing for me at all. I am 5'9"", have a 34.5 inseam, a short torso and generally wear a size 8-10. I took the advice of other reviewers and ordered a size smaller because they are super duper stretchy (which I don't like-- a little stretch is good) but it didn't help. I have a curvy figure and these jeans actually made my butt look flat! Not Good. I'm sending them back because even though they were $14, they're still not worth the price."
5,Great Jeans,"These jeans have a nice cut and a good price. They are not tight but not baggy- nice over boots. The denim is a good weight. Not very thin like some jeans with a bit of stretch. They do run large and they don't shrink. I am lucky to have a store near me(Sheplers) so I tried them on. Before these my favorite jeans were JJills Authentic fit boot cut. Now they have changed the cut. I think these Aura jeans in the regular rise, which is a little below the waist in front-- are like my old favorites but better."
5,Colorful Tribute to the 8th Air Force!,"Warren Bodie is probably America's last independent aviation history author-publisher. Over the years he has written and self-published a series of books - Pacific War Eagles, Republic's P-47, Lockheed P-38 - noted for quality research, top-notch photo reproduction and excellent paper quality.Bodie's latest book, the first of two volumes on the 8th AF, is his best yet. It features over 180 pages of insightful text and ultra-sharp photos - many of them rare and many given the full-page treatment - showing the men and aircraft of the Mighty Eighth. Thirty-two pages of color photos and gorgeous color profiles by Bob Boyd are icing on the cake.Though it resembles a coffee-table book, Bodie's book is much more and is great value for the price. More power to you, Warren!Highly recommended!"
3,good but is a disappointed.........................,because I bought expecially this item concerning Jonbenet Ramsey Beauty pageant career and unluckly about JB there isn't neither the shade.Anyway a good and funny documentary.
1,pulp fiction,"I give one star for his effort and congragulate Stuart on his audacity to print such fiction. The one big thing lacking in this books is EVIDENCE, EVIDENCE, and EVIDENCE to support his claims. I am all hyped-up to write about the secret life of Mother Theresa of Calcutta..."
5,Relativity and gravity clearly defined.,"This book should be brought, if for nothing else, then for the chapter entitled, ""Beyond Velikovsky"". In this treatise, the author clearly explains the theory of relativity and how it relates to gravity. Pawlicki's contention is that gravity is a standing wave structure, as is all matter in the universe. His theories combine relativity and harmonics into somewhat of a unified theory of matter. He builds his case thoroughly, through incremental logical steps that will leave the reader in utter amazement that the establishment just doesn't get these simple concepts! (Or maybe they do, and are suppressing them from the public). At any rate, this book will enhance your understanding of relativity, time travel and harmonics theories, and is a must-read for all budding theorists."
4,Happy Boy,"I purchased these for my sons 5th birthday party. He loves Dinosaurs and all of the Diggin for Dinos products were perfect. Good quality, Great fun."
4,Review of Hadas' Ethiopica,"Hadas, as usualy, presents a readable and interested translation. However, I'll note that I couldn't 'feel' the Greek beneath the translation. Perhaps Heliodorus simply wrote with very English syntax, but to be honest I feel like the translator must have worked hard to reconstruct the grammar as he did. This reads very much like Jane Austen.However, considering content, this is more a Pride and Prejudice and Zombies affair, with various scenes of suppliant infants crawling in the dust and naked warriors chasing down horses. Much of the early writing is the usual romantic affair--the ending is most promising. The book also presents a rare picture of ancient Ethiopia (however accurate, I cannot say)."
4,good enough for music geeks,good enough for music geeks but casual listeners ought look elsewhere--double fine zone is continuum's best in my opinion and unlikely to be surpassed
5,God Bless those girls,I have been a fan of the triplets since I was a little girl growing up on the Ole South Plantation. I am so saddened to hear about Eadie's passing but just know that she is entertaining the angels with her beautiful voice.Sister Taffy and the Baby Jesus love the DEL RUBIO TRIPLETS and so should you...
3,The new Chill of Fear,"If you like Kay Hooper and I do, you must read this latest book in the Special Crimes Unit series.I have read all of her books and enjoyed this one but it is not her best work. It is a great way to introduce new Special Crimes Unit psychics and she has a special talent for putting you right into the plot. I liked the powerful ""psychic powers"" displayed.The ending seemed as though it was written on a short deadline and left me a bit disappointed since a number of questions remained regarding some of the supporting characters."
2,Lame genre fiction,"Unlike some reviewers here, I haven't read the other (apparently better) books in this series. The larger premise--a special wing of the FBI staffed by psychics--completely hooked me, but this novel quickly devolved into standard genre schlock with all its weaknesses: ""Characters"" who interchangeably spout exposition, contrived romance, and so on.Here's hoping other books in the series are more satisfying."
5,"Great buy, keeps out the light","I have tried several mask and for me this is the best. Adjustable, keeps out the light even when I am napping with the west sun shining in my room during the day. Love the color choice. It even has a place for ear plugs which helps when I travel. To me it is worth the price."
2,Not recommended,"I would pass on this product. 5 minutes after opening the box I regretted it as the knife is dull, and difficult to get out. The light switch is tough to move, and I needed to use pliers to get the scissors out. Perhaps it will loosen over time, but there are much better products out there."
3,nice but not the knife,this product is nice but it has so much that every item in it gets degraded the knife is SUPER SMALL the scicors are a little too skiny and in my opinion getting rid of the nail file to make the other things better would have been great
4,Check It Out,"Definetly worth checking this one out...CREEP VAN has GREAT kills and lots of cool EXTRA's on the DVD...it comes out in the US on Dec 11, 2012 but I saw the DVD at the American Film Market ahead of the North American DVD release. This film is funny and original but still a really good classic horror film.I give this an 8...worth buying to own!"
2,So So,Tries to be old time horror movie but is low budget and not very original.Wait for cable when it is free.
1,Love obscure foreign films.....but,This movie is just such a snooze and full of randomstrange scenes (not suitable for family viewing - even with children over 16). I ordered because of all the great reviews -now I just don't understand how this could be enjoyed byso many. Maybe they have family members from the village..?
2,Failed attempt to explain fratricide,"The Italians of San Martino had a hard time crushed between retreating Germans and advancing Americans, with fascists and partisans, even in the same family, killing each other. The movie lacks substance and conviction.The story of Italian 'resistance' it is not,but it could have been.It missed."
3,"Love the product, unhappy with Polsteins Home and Beyond","I love these easy track systems for closets. This is the second unit that I have purchased. I went from a single closet to the walk in type and this second unit will amend the first. Installation is easy (hardest part is finding the studs) and it have many versatile configuratons. The shipper was a bit of a disappointment. Package arrived with some damage and a 2ft wardrobe rod was flattened. Their solution was for me to send the whole unit back ($58 shipping) so that they could replace the unit, or I could call the manufacturer (answering machine) and hope they might send a replacement part. If there is a charge for the replacement part then I may as well go to Fred Meyer (Kroeger) and just by the 48"" rod for $12.99 and cut it down. That's way cheaper than paying to ship back for replacement. The closet system in 5 stars, but the shipper is 1 star so it gets a 3 star rating from me."
3,A lesson for all humanity.,"Ernest Gordon provides a sobering but ultimately uplifting account of life in the Japanese POW camps of Thailand in WW2. Gordon found God amongst the mud and death, and his story of more than 3 years as a prisoner of war is closely entwined with his spiritual awakening. While his effusive outpourings on God and Christ could turn off the more secular reader, one cannot deny the effect Gordon's faith had on his attitude to his predicament, and indeed his very survival. This in turn doubtless played a significant role in helping many others survive a dreadful experience. One may find that Gordon dwells a little too long on God, and he makes some rather erroneous statements concerning the Buddhists he encountered in Thailand, but nevertheless his is a remarkable tale that inspires deeply."
3,"Nice introduction to SQL, but rather MS SQL Server specific!","This book is about developing the skills to debug SQL. I particularly like the chapteron best practices and the chapter on trees. Best practices talk about the things thatone should follow when doing SQL. I guess this would be particularly useful for peopledeveloping ""standard procedures"" company-wide.The other chapter on Trees talks about implementing tree-like structure in databases. Itcovers quite thoroughly on this topic and also zoomed in on various database-specific commandslike ""connect by""(Oracle).Overall, this book is a good book on SQL, with chapters that cover normalization, choosingdatatypes and create,delete, insert ... and aggregate commands. The only thing I dislikeis that the author seems to be more well-verse in SQL Server and the examples are ratherSQL Server specific. :("
2,disorganized,"I will say the positive things first. I do agree that it is a good workout and will tone your body gradually, which is healthy. Here are my complaints. I felt this workout was disorganized. Billy often stops to talk to you to try to motivate you but he is so out of breath that it sounds like a mouthfull of nothing. Also, billy is so busy talking that it appears he forgets how many reps per side have been done and many times the reps are unequal (one of my big pet peeves). My final and biggest complaint is that Billy frequently says ""one more set"" and there is more than one. I am not usually one to complain, but I need structure in my workout and this video was too disorganized and sloppy for me."
5,Great Learning Tool,"My 6th grade students love this microscope. They have imported both still pictures and movies of mosquito larvae from pond water into Power Point Presetations. They also imported a movie of a live mosquito they captured. They were able to get decent, not great, pictures of bread mold, decaying materials, and other micro-organism related things. I have four of these in my classroom and will soon be ordering more. No, they're not the greatest microscopes in the world, and sure they have their little glitches ( it seems to me that most of these kinds of products do), but for the price and what I want to use them for, they are great."
2,DIsappointed,In my opinion this item is not worth the money. Very crude focus controls. Magnification seems to work but you can't focus. Just when the item starts to become clear you reach the end of the travel. Also at this time the unit will not work on any of my XP Pro PCs. It did at one time but I expect the drivers are now outdated for XP.
4,Awesome,"Appears to be a small studio performance, intimate audience, only Cat Stevens and Alun Davies performing. Sound quality is pretty good for the age of the video recording. Difficult to hear Cat talking between songs, but the vocals in the songs are clear. Song list is AWESOME. Loved the recording, being a longtime Cat Stevens fan."
2,Oneida Michelangelo 2-piece entertainment set,The delivery was on time. The product was packaged ok. The only thing was that the 2 pieces had a few marks on them and the one had a defected point. I was not too pleased especially for what they cost! It would be to much hassle and money to send back for a replacement. (and that is what they know). Don't know if I would buy again from them.
5,You have to hear this!,"This album is two years old now, but it has a classic sound that I never tire of. If you like people such as St. Germain, Jamiroquai, Nelly Furtado or Sade, then you will probably like this too. It's mellow, funky, uplifting and smooth. Ivana is one talented artist, in the true sense of the word. She sings in English and Italian, plays trumphet and keyboard, sings, and wrote and produced this album all on her own indie label. I met her after one of her shows, and she's also a very nice person. :) I honestly can't say enough good things about her. The album is worth the price. Buy it, you won't regret it."
5,This really works...no joke,"I rarely write reviews, but this product inspired me to write one for fellow acne sufferers. I've tried almost every topical acne cream, from drugstore brands (they don't work and contain cheap, dangerous chemicals) to more expensive brands (some work but then stop working). The two ingredients, zinc and sulfur, in this product seem relatively harmless and are known to help with acne. I've take zinc in pill form, though, and it hasn't helped. Regardless, this cream has rapidly reduced a horrible cystic acne breakout on my chin that has for weeks been getting worse. The color of the cream blends in with my skin and works as a type of concealer. The cream's color will be too dark for someone with pale skin, but I'd recommend this cream anyway for use at night. I really hope it doesn't stop working like most acne products. I'll keep you updated."
3,Please Issue on DVD,"Clearly the best performances of the otherwise disappointing careers of Micky Rourke and Eric Roberts. (With the possible exception of ""Angel Heart"" for Rourke) Sharp witty dialogue and a clever plot made this a very enjoyable feature when I first saw it in 1984. I'm still waiting for it to be released on DVD to add it to my collection."
4,100% Fun!,"The title gets it right - this is a very fun album. There are a lot of great songs on here. Infectious lyrics and music - it still surprises me that Matthew Sweet isn't more popular than he is.One other thing...it's a sin that ""We're The Same"" wasn't a bigger hit than it was. Truly a great song!"
4,Charming!,"Jenny's mom is having a birthday and Jenny wants to give her something really nice--like a fur coat. There is a small problem--she only has twenty-seven cents. Even if her friend, Wilson, lends her his life savings of three dollars and change, she still won't have enough. What to do? Get a job.When Jenny's first venture, as a dog trainer, falls through, she decides she can baby sit and make enough money. Babysitting for money is harder than just playing with her baby cousin, though. And, it might just cost her a pet goldfish.This is a cute story about a little girl misunderstanding statements about her family's finances and her creative ways of making money. Children, ages five to eight, will enjoy Jenny and her friend.Armchair Interviews says: The charm and humor of this book will have readers looking for others in the Jenny Archer adventures series."
4,Nice Sound,"This product is ok, but it is not to be compared to say his ""Kingdom Business"" series. All in all I would have to say; there is a nice mellow sound to this cd. You have to kinda be in the mood for it though."
3,Not what I expected,"I heard one of the cuts from the cd on the radio. That is what prompted me to purchased it, unfortunately, it was the only one sond on the cd I liked. The rest of it was just ""noise"" to me. Based on that, I would not purchase anything else by this artist."
2,Too much stuff going on at once,"I enjoyed this book, but there just seemed like there was too much weird stuff going on to really believe or follow. It also seemed a little far-fetched at times. I liked the insite that Puzo gave when describing the criminals and the president of the US. I would describe this book to my friends as a decent read, but would not recommend."
4,overall happy,I recieved the item within a week. There is a bit more wear then discribed but for the price I am happy with my purchase.
3,"Good Premise, Lack Lustre Ending","This book has a great premise and looks at the powerplay of Washington and the rich in the US, sadly the ending let the book down. You are kept engaged and turning the pages throughout this book, but the ending leaves a little to be desired and the way certain characters behave is out of character, so to speak. Puzo gets a little lost for fifty or so pages in the middle as well. The problem is that being so spoilt with the Godfather and other mafia related books, you expect such a high standard from puzo, that this book lets you down slightly. Saying that, this is a good political thriller and a good couple of days reading.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,"A forgettable, unbelievable novel.","Mario Puzo wrote one good book. This one is not it. Another Kennedy in the White House, another death, and some unbelievable terrorists all combine to make this book entirely forgettable.Unless you are a real Puzo fan, give this one a miss."
1,Mistaken Identity,"The woman who helped engineer the useless war against the Christians in the Balkans (to help Klinton distract us fro Monicagate), promoted our sales of technology to the Korean Dictator so he could threaten the world with his nukes, is now in a panic to justify her actions which so harmed America.I cannot read the reviews which praise her without wondering how she could be so misunderstood/identified.She is a disgrace."
2,Too much Frisco and not enough Stills,"Every great writer and performer has a dud in his or her catalog and this was it for Stills. Completely flat, forgettable and boring album here. Far too influenced that that painfully boring Frisco tripe that Dead and Airplane fans regard as ""GENIUS!"" because it's cool to say that. Stick with the CSN&Y, Stills 1 & 2 and other stuff. Heck, even Right By You is better than this. Also be sure to check out Stills 1975 work simply named ""Stills"" and ""Illegal Stills"". Those are good memorable albums."
5,Stephen Stills Masterpiece,"Stephen Stills / Manassas: this was a double LP with each of the four sides given a title (The Raven, The Wilderness, Consider, and Rock N Roll is here to stay) and it is a classic in Country-Rock history. This is Stephen Stills' Masterpiece. This is a huge musical statement done to near perfection. This album deserves a Sixth Star."
3,Not For Kids Who Were Adopted,"I do not like this book overall. While it does have age appropriate discussion of sex and pregnancy with a Christian focus, the text is too long in my opinion for a child of the target age to sit and listen. My primary objection is that this book is not appropriate at all for adopted children. The stories are told entirely from the point of view of a birth child. The comments and discussions focus on the idea of children being born into the family, nursing to be fed, and so on. There is a very tiny discussion about all families being ""different"" and a particular child not looking like his birth parents b/c he was adopted; this plus the strong focus of the text on birth families would alienate a child who was adopted rather than inform him/her. If you are looking for a facts of life book and your child was adopted, do not get this book."
1,Sub Standard for IMAX - but educational,"I'm an IMAX fan, so I was a bit disappointed in the limited use of the format and cinematagraphy in The Mystery Of The Maya. It's not that it is a bad documentary; it is indeed quite educational. The problem is that it is just a documentary, without the IMAX eye candy that causes folks to buy big screen sets and pilgramage to BIG screen theatres with each new release. Compare this to Blue Planet or Everest at 5 stars and it's hard to come up with more than 1 star."
3,Good if you've been to the sites; otherwise IMAX fluff,"I rented ""Mystery of the Maya"" after returning from a visit to Tulum and Chichรฉn Itzรก. This DVD provided a few interesting tidbits and some good shots of the ruins. But for the most part it's typical IMAX fluff: a brief (40 min.) documentary on a subject that deserves much more, with in-depth history sacrificed for a few random facts and sweeping cinematography (the latter of which doesn't translate to the small screen). The major faults of this production are that it doesn't identify the ruins as it shows them, nor does it give much substantial information. For instance, ""Mystery of the Maya"" didn't even discuss the theories as to why the Mayans suddenly abandoned these spectacular sites.In the end, this DVD is good if you've been to some of these sites, but don't watch it before a trip expecting to get some great insider information for your visit."
5,"Great reading, highly recommend","I had heard of this book and positive commens, but never knew why until I started reading it. Living in the area described by the book, I can state that is is most factual. If you have ever wondered what is so unique about the people of the area, this book is for you. The author makes you feel that you are actually back in time."
3,Doesnt smell like acqua di gio,"it seems like a different scent then the cologne, but i guess its because its only suppose to accent the actual cologne?"
3,An Excellent Book But Needs Errata,"This edition (2nd) of this excellent book has many typos and errors. I am very disappointed that so far, no errata are available online. I hope the errors will be corrected in future printings."
3,Interesting perspective,"Motel of the mysteries is a fun, easy read.Everyday items are seen in the light of future archeologists, with interesting, funny and sometimes insightful interpretations. Good book to share with others."
5,superb satire,"There's nothing much to add to the other favorable reviews, except to emphasize that Macaulay's satire applies to almost all human experience -- we tend to interpret the unfamiliar in terms only of what we know, or how we would like things to be.The illustrations are wonderful. The best is a spoof of the famous photograph of Heinrich Schliemann's wife wearing ""Trojan"" jewelry. * The future archaeologist's wife is adorned with religious artifacts from the motel -- except there's nothing religious about them. It's hysterical.An attack on shallow thinking and (as Sherlock Holmes said) ""speculating without evidence"", ""Motel of the Mysteries"" is unreservedly recommended.PS: I'm about to buy a new copy because the old one -- which is at least 20 years old -- fell apart. It was cheaply bound, and the glue finally lost its hold. I'd therefore suggest purchasing a new copy, rather than a used one.* This photo is reproduced in the Wikipedia article about Schliemann."
5,Laugh out loud funny spoof of archeology,"Macauley's other books, such as CASTLE, show our archeologists' recreations of times past. But what if it's ALL WRONG???In MOTEL OF THE MYSTERIES, we get a marvelous story of a future archeologist finding, and completely misunderstanding, an ordinary motel room.Great fun, and you'll never watch a Discover Channel special with quite that credulity again."
4,GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY,"One has no idea who is playing or singing these various opera excerpts, but most of the voices are very good. If you're a serious opera buff and know these pieces well, you might think some of them aren't top quality singers or orchestras, but if you just want to have some nice pieces of opera to listen without analysing the playing/singing capabilities, this is the CD for you.I actually bought this CD at Fopp (a chain of CD/DVD shops) for 3.00 !! I gather the sister or parent company of the manufacturer of this CD has gone into liquidation...Anyway, to sum up, a great bargain for not-too-serious opera lovers."
3,"Decent for the money, but not expandable.","It's a decent product but I was ignorant, not realizing there was an expandableModel and a none expandable model. I thought they were all expandable. So I found out after receiving it that I could only use one receiver with this transmitter. I recommend you pay a few more bucks and get an expandable model."
3,Better recording needed for this era.,"I remember being very disappointed at the sound quality of this album when it came out. Compared to Yessongs, which is one of the great live recordings, it is a very dry soundboard recording. I assume these songs were plucked as being the best performances for all three years and songs represented, which they very well may be. But at the time of taping, they were simply not intended for release. They are unattended board recordings used for reference."
3,Just one.,"Fooled me. The part about having ""assorted colors"", along with the picture, meant to me that I'd get all four. It's not like we can choose which color we want. I really would prefer they would omit ""assorted colors"" all over their description.Anyway, it's a decent ruler and just what I need for my projects."
5,Necessary Tool,"This is a necessary tool for Greek students who are building rare vocabulary and for beginner/intermediate students who need help finding rare words. It can become a crutch, but it can be invaluable if used properly. Another option is a Readers Greek NT that has vocab at the bottom of each page of Greek Text. However, if you want to use the textual notes in one of the other versions of the Greek NT, this is a good option."
3,Not Ross Thomas at His Best,"Of the ten or so Ross Thomas books I've read, this one would come in 10th place. It's just not an inspired work. It's not particularly clever, or witty, or intriquing as I expect his novels to be. If this had been the first one of his I'd read, I wouldn't bother to read another. In fact, I didn't finished it even though I had only a few pages to go; I just didn't care. In short, pass on this one."
3,Documention,I bought this video for my 4 year old nephew. This video is too old for him. It went way back in history of batman and robin. I thought it was going to be a cartoon. It was on the old bat and robin tv series. I believe it went all the way back to the '30s. It was like a documentation of batman and robin. Some of the villans are not even around anymore. I would not recomend this for younger batman and robin fans.
1,"Great movie, horrible dvd","I love this movie! Its among my top favorites. However, the DVD [is bad]! One reason, the dubbing. The first half of the movie is fine, but about half way through, the words being spoken by the characters dont match up with their mouth. It looks like a bad Bruce Lee movie! Im not one to complain, but it just kept getting worse! At one point the whole line was almost spoken before the characters mouth started moving! I just baffles me that those responsible for transfering this movie to DVD took no care at all in doing it! I really dont know how this DVD made it to stores without someone noticing this huge fault and trying to make it better. Like I said, this is my favorite movie, I give it the lowest rating for the lack of dubbing quaility!"
4,Classic Billy Crystal,"A great movie in theaters and still fun to watch. The trio of Crystal, the late Bruno Kirby and Daniel Stern is hysterical. There is also the great supporting cast with Newman from Seinfeld and don't forget about Jack Palance as the old Marlboro man Curly.The bonus features are a nice addition to give you more insight into the cast and development of City Slickers. A great movie to have part of your collection."
3,just okay,"this one was just okay. the first movie was better. This one was trying too hard. Some jokes seemed out of place, like they were trying to fill time"
3,For hardcore fans...,"Danni's remixes are for the hardcore fans only. There are only two songs on this cd that I can truly listen to, and they're the Trouser Enthusiasts remixes. The rest is just a bunch of cheesy remixes that wouldn't even make a club. I gave 3 stars for both tracks I liked. they were very good."
2,"Oh, man. This is terrible.","I watch a lot of Asian movies. Lots of them. I consider myself pretty liberal as to other culture's versions of good movies.This movie, however, sucks, even by Chinese standards. The translation is bad, the camerawork is pretty much camcorder quality, sometimes worse. And the story is incoherent.The only good part, is it's like being in China. You see how it really is, which is neat."
3,Return of the Magnificent Seven,ok western. I liked Yul Brenner better in the King & I. & Robert Fuller better in Laramie.
1,poor product,"No one bothered to contact me after I emailed the company TWICE about the product, at their company website-""contact us"" (you know the tyoe of contact page that does not provide an email copy to you--The malfunction symbol appeared after a few uses, so I spent $60 for nothing."
4,School House Rock! Rocks,This was bought for my stepdaughter who is learning multiplication. She really enjoys the singing and her class is currently using this as well to help other students. She likes that she's able to sing along.
5,A+,"Top quality. Educational. This is a fun way to learn about math. This tool wasn't around when we were growing up, so we had a hard time learning the importance of math and how it relates to money that we all use every day. I'm excited for our kids. This is a great life lesson tool. The whole family will watch and learn from this over and over."
5,trustfull tool,"This iitem does what it is designed for. For long-term use, and not having to rely on a bike shop or mechanic, the price was reasonable."
5,Goldfinger cant be beat,Theres no doubt about it Goldfinger's STOMPING GROUND is an awesome cd. its one of those cds that you'll never stop listening to in about 2 months. you'll never get sick of it. Its one of those cds that all you want to do is listen to it and do nothing else. It's a must have for any person that likes rock or punk or whatever. every song is a great one. well BRO isnt that good but the rest of them are. i just cant belive i got it so late. this cd is a must have and i dont think anyone could hate Goldfingers music. its just not a possiablity.... So for all you people that cant decide on to get it or not. take my word for it. its worth your money.
4,"Great, but Self-Titled is better","I recently bought this CD. I have been a fan of goldfinger for some time now, and after hearing the Self-Titled one I was totally amazed. Hang-ups followed up with a touch of Ska, and I also loved that CD. Buying this one, I had high expectations. Althought this CD is great, if you are a long time fan of Goldfinger you might not like it as much. Some of the best songs are Counting the Days, 99 Red Balloons, Im Down, and Pick A Fight. Although it isnt their best, it is still worth the money"
3,"So, how do you top a classic? Obviously, you don't.","In 1997, Goldfinger released ""Hang Ups"". It is one of my favorite albums, a perfect balance of pop, punk, and ska. So, how do you top a classic? Obviously, you don't. Stomping Ground finds Goldfinger showing their rougher edges a little more. The balance between their three styles has shifted back towards their punk roots. This is still a good album, but it lacks the melodic crispness and revels in the art of noise a little more than I would like. Still, when on their game, as on ""Counting the Days"", ""San Simean"", and the cover of the new wave classic ""99 Red Balloons"", Goldfinger can thrill."
5,They still have it.,"Let me just say i am a diehard fan of goldfinger, ever since their first album. This CD lives up to every expectation that i ever had of them. I definatly give them a 5 stat review. Ska at it's finest."
3,"It does remove a lot of hum, but....","I got one of these several years ago because hum is a big problem where I live. I tried this out in the store with a clean sounding stratocaster and yeah, it worked, so I took it home. There, I tried it with a distorted sound and you could really tell it was sucking something out of my guitars low end sound. I would like this thing if I could just dial in a little of it. I may try it with a Boss EQ after it to see if it will bring back some of the lost tone. Try before you buy. I could actually see putting this in an effect send/return and eek it in as needed."
4,A good basic guide to self-defense against an armed attacker.,"Even though this book was written more than twenty years ago, it is a classic in its field. There are no fancy and impractical techniques in this book. The author has experience in military close quarter combat systems, and the techniques he teaches are based upon the reality of street combat. Though I do not agree with all the techniques in this manual; nevertheless, the author does show some very effective techniques against the knife and other weapons. I do like his approach to defending against the knife by using a chair and any other objects available.In conclusion, even though the techniques are not complex, they still require a lot of practice to master.Rating: 4 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Knife Handling and Knife Defense Official Course Manual)."
4,Best Phone Log of this type that I've found.,"Cheap, thin, and gets the job done. I've looked at other phone log books and find that this one is better laid out. I also like that's thin. Plenty of space to write a short blurb of the message. My only critique is that I think the name of the caller should be the first item listed, or at least the second (currently it's the third, after date and number)."
5,Headboard,"Purchased two of these headboards for a guestbedroom. Well made, look lovely. Very happywith this purchase."
4,A Tale of Enemies and Friendship,"This book is a wonderful story about two completely different girls who find themselves brought together through several incidents. After stolen friends, fights, competitions, and more, Ernestine and Amanda have come a little closer to being friends, while remaining in an ""in-between"" zone as not yet friends, and not yet enemies. The story continues in, ""Summer Camp: Ready or Not!"" which is another excellent addition to the series. I enjoyed this book, just because of the ""well-writteness"" of the story. Ernestine and Amanda are like real people almost, experiencing real life issues, real hate, and real friendship."
3,interesting read,This book is interesting. Often crude and graphic. Could have done without the rough language. Good advice though and my husband is following much of it. Thanks
1,The stuff nightmares are made of.,"I've never been pregnant; I picked up this book in the bookstore because the title intrigued me.Now that I have had the misfortune to read it, I will probably never have children. According to this piece of garbage, you will permanently change for the worse after having a baby. Your teeth and hair will fall out, you'll never get back into shape no matter how hard you exercise (a lie that has been proven by numerous female gymnasts who have had children), you'll forever have problems relieving yourself...you name it!I would like to meet this author in person and give her a piece of my mind. Better yet, I'd like to introduce her to my mother, who has had 5 children and looks and behaves no worse for the wear.All in all, mostly lies and garbage."
5,what a party!,"This Wild Party is so great to listen to. I was never fortunate enough to see the show, but this recording preserves it wonderfully. Julia Murney's Queenie is incredible. She is one of musical theatre's treasures. I know I will see her in many more shows to come. Idina Menzel is also wonderful. Her ""Life OF The Party"" will knock your socks off. Taye Diggs, as Black, is great as well, as is Brian d'Arcy James. Other standouts on this CD are Alix Korey's lesbien Madeline True, who's Old Fashioned Love Story is one of the best musical theatre songs of the year. Also, Jennifer Cody is a very cute Mae, who has another great voice. Andrew Lippa has written a wonderful show and if you don't buy this you are a fool. A FOOL!"
4,"As a complete show, not great, but...","If you are buying this cd just for the music, then I'd have a hard time thinking of a better one. All the songs in the show are catchy and hummable, not to mention beltable. There was a lot of thought put into the composition and it shows through the compatability of the singers' voices to the songs.The reason this show didn't make it to b'way and John LaChiusa's did is mostly in the book. I performed it this year and the plot just doesn't hold up through dialogue and music as does LaChiusa's. The music does not have a consistency that usually accompanies a broadway hit. (a.k.a. they could all have been written by different composers, there's little to show a solid connecting line throughout.) But as I said, all the songs are good, the harmonies, if too complicated for their own good sometimes, are startlingly eye-opening. This is a great soundtrack with great performances and it belongs in your collection."
4,"not a huge fan of musicals, but....","okay, so i'm not generally a fan of musicals. i only like a few and don't really listen to them by choice. but i have a few friends who ""force"" musicals on me, and this has been the most recent one. it took some getting used to, like most musical soundtracks do when you aren't used to listening to the genre, but now i love it. i never knew the story until the last time i heard the soundtrack, after two weeks or more of listening to it. but without knowing the story i still really enjoyed the music and the sounds and...everything really. i highly recommend this cd for someone who isn't enthusiastic generally for broadway musicals, but with the jazz sounds it's not the traditional musical and highly enjoyable."
2,Anything but a wild Wild Party.,"While I didn't see this show, judging by the OCRs of the two musicalizations of Joseph Moncure March's poem during the 2000 New York theatre season, Andrew Lippa's seems to be the weaker adaptation. The music, while fine for a more traditional-type score, does little to establish its locale (late 1920s New York), and never really succeeds at bringing its subject matter to life. While the performers are obviously talented, and Lippa demonstrates remarkable technical skills as a composer, his work doesn't seem to jump off the disc in quite the same way LaChiusa's version does. While an interesting and, overall, worthwhile purchase, this recording preserves well a score that sounds like it was never completely fleshed-out or completed."
2,Ack.,"Thomas Hardy's final novel is a very good book, almost a great book. This movie takes the major themes of the book -- religion, education, temptation, and man's curious position in this world -- and summarily discards most of them. It injects ""erotic"" scenes that were absent from the book, plays extremely fast-and-loose with Jude and Arabella's relationship, shreds the characterization (cf. Aunt Drusilla), and just generally makes a muddled mess of things. Arabella and Sue (sorry, Winslet fans) are terribly miscast, and Eccleston is a doubtful Jude indeed. From the abridgement of the book's title, which is Hardy's finest and among my favorites, to the choppy scene breaks (admittedly, a flaw of the original novel), this movie just doesn't do the book justice."
5,"Kate,Kate, Kate!","Kate Winslet is ABSOULUTELY AWESOME in this movie. I saw it because I am a huge Kate Winslet fan, and this movie is abfab! Chris also does a wonderful job as Jude, but Kate is the real star. She pulls you into her role, makes you cry when she crys. This movie is just as sad as TITANIC, which I found out about Kate. The cinematography and screenplay are awesome, and I loved the black and white beginning. If you haven't seen this movie, put it on your must see list now, and all of Kate's other movies (I've seen and have them all)."
2,Pointless Pursuit of Love,"A movie of forbidden love between cousins. I wish I could say I enjoyed the story, but when you watch individuals making pointless choices in life, I often don't find it very entertaining. I love Kate Winslet. The woman is brilliant in anything she stars in frankly. You can see the very young actress in an emotional role. As far as the story, ""yawn."" Perhaps I would have found some satisfaction if the man wasn't just driven by his male appetites, but had actually pursued the true love of his life - knowledge. The movie has its deep tragedy that changes everything, but leaves the audience with a sad and raveled ending, which comes to no real conclusion or a lasting theme to make you feel satisfied after the words ""The End."" Not my favorite story."
5,Tragically beautiful,"This is the absolute most wonderful movie I have ever seen. Aside from being a Kate Winslet fan, this movie literally ripped my soul apart. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it!"
1,Watch Something Else!,"Two hours of my time were wasted by watching this dreary film. I kept hoping it would get better, but no. It's relentlessly cruel, achingly futile and supremely depressing. Not even it's two very talented stars could elevate this material. Watch anything else!"
4,needs to be captioned,The programs were great but we were disappointed that it was not captioned. Many elderly people have hearing problems and they are the ones who would most enjoy these videos.
2,"10 minutes a day, everyday for the next 30 years...","Be wary of any Russian course that promises quick, effortless results. Learning Russian grammar is like putting together a 5000 piece jigsaw puzzle. Without a picture, it's pretty tedious. This book will not help you get ""the picture"". It teaches 1st/2nd conjugation verbs and a couple of necessary irregular verbs, but that's all the grammar you get. You do get some basic vocabulary words, but not ones that will help you very far in conversational situations. If you are a traveler and need a crash course to survive your trip through Russia, a good phrase book will better serve you. Finally, I have no idea why this book is called ""10 minutes a day"", there is no plan of attack included to tell you how to meter your studying, and 10 minutes is a little short to get something like Russian to sink into your brain."
1,quality vs quantity,I am very disappointed in the quality of this CD.24 hits on this CD. But sound quality is poor and CD is not fluid.Kind of skippy.
5,Wilson Pickets greatest hits,"I have always been a blues lover long before it was ""in"". I have blues recordings from the late 50's and for some reason did not buy any of his music. All of these selections are great and I have enjoyed getting acquainted with Wilson, just wish I had done it before he passed away."
4,Great travel aid!,"My ONLY complaint about this nifty little notebook case is that the clothing department's strap fasteners aren't very strong and occasionally give way so when I open it up, my socks go flying. Other than that, though, this case is awesome. The side-entry to the computer compartment is the most convenient out of any computer case I've ever seen, and there's plenty of room for cables and peripherals, as well as a change of socks & undies, just in case my checked luggage gets lost. The wheels and handle are well-built and tough, and the rollers run smoothly. It looks sharp and clean, and was a lifesaver when I went overseas on business!"
4,Great Pen,I love this pen. It is well balanced and the crome isn't alick at all. It writes exremly smooth and the flow is even. I would have given the pen 5 stars if I had ordered it with the extra fine nib. I ordered the fine nib and it is to broad for my taste. However with the fine nib it still has that fountain pen feel and look to my writing.
3,Needs more seeds,"I helped my grandaughter put together this triad. It needs a little more ""fairy"" dust stuff--that would add to the magic, and it definitely needs more seeds (they were so minute that I couldn't tell where we planted them. The fun is watching the plants grow--so it is better to overseed!"
1,don't waste your money,"My 5 year old daughter received this as a gift. She was very excited and we quickly went to work on creating our fairy garden even though we were both very disappointed at the quality of the product. It is all plastic. The fairy statue is a tiny little purple thing. It isn't at all as cool as the box makes it look. We even had to use most of the seeds during the first planting. We quickly had some sprouts, but within 2 weeks we had mold and the entire thing died. I tried everything to revive it, however I think that the $$ spent was not worth it. I will add that I have a green thumb and know a great deal about plants. We placed in the perfect spot in the house and I watched it like a hawk to make sure that things would go well."
2,Not Worth the Money,"I bought this for my daughter as a thank you for working so hard in the house and at school. That was a grand gesture considering the terrarium is nothing more than a lightweight plastic bowl with an even lighter weight clear plastic dome lid. Her kit was missing the seeds. We prepped the dirt, placed the cheap looking all-yellow-fairy in the dirt, positioned the colored rocks and pinwheel with bells and headed to Lowes to get seeds (as close to what they were supposed to be as possible) -- I was NOT going to contact the company and wait for seeds to arrive. My daughter placed the stickers on the sides of the bowl and we are now waiting. The plants better grow. Hmmm."
4,"SG-1: Season 1, Vol. 2","As a fan of the series it is great to have these episodes out on DVD. My one complaint is that only Vol. 1 & Vol. 2 are available individually. If you want Volumes 3-5 to complete the first season episodes, you need to purchase the entire Season One Boxed Set (I have the same problem with the ""X-Files"" and a couple other shows). Looking forward to Season Two whenever that comes out on DVD."
4,"I forced myself to like it, and it was worth it.","First listen: not that happy with it Second listen: Still not that happy Third listen: Cody is the coolest song ever, but the rest not that good. Fourth listen: ok, this album is pretty good Fifth listen: awesome Sixth and so on: one of the best purchases i've ever made.This is not your typical mogwai. No vibes on this one, But they make up for it with awesome dynamics and very moody tracks. This album was engineered and produced by David Fridman (mercury rev), who has also recently done the Flaming Lips soft bulletin, and was also in on the recording of Weezer's Pinkerton. David Fridman is one of the best engineers out there today. Richard Formby (ex-Spectrum) also makes a great slide guitar appearance on ""Cody"". Get this CD, and give it time. If you don't like it at first, give it another listen.Blur : Are Shite"
2,"the album cover is cool, that's it","I think I have a feeling of what mogwai wanted to achieve with this album, and the sound and vibe of it, but I don't they succeeded at all. It's an album where you have to listen to as a whole, but that proves to be very difficult at times. First off, the album is about 10-15 minutes too long. It just drags and drags, its very monotone and lifeless at most times, and it feels a bit bloated as a whole. The title track, christmas steps and ex-cowboy are all good tracks, but thats pretty much it."
2,Yankee Doodle Dandy,"From memory this film had more of an impression on me when I watched it on VHS some 20 years ago. A good cast with some atempt at decent ""One Liners"". The Director's attempts with portraying the ""National Guard"" in such a bad light as ""Auxilary"" borders on overkill. However there is some nice realisim at the conclusion of the film that most who have come back to civilisation from ""The Bush"" could attest to.I'll Keep it."
1,Amazing,I have'nt heard the Original Original (from 1964). I can only assume this is a case of The Emperors New clothes and no one had the courage to kill this recording at birth. Whoever had the idea that asking Carol Channing to revisit the part of Dolly Levi was worthwhile deserves to be drummed out of the Entertainment Industry. In case there is any confusion this recording is dire. It sounds like Walter Mattau after a very heavy night on the tiles (I have no reason to assume Walter M ever had a heavy night on the tiles). The only reason to buy this is to give confidence to anyone who fancies trying musical theatre and thinks their voice is not up to scratch. If this can reach Broadway there is hope for anyone. I am only familiar with a few recordings of Dolly but would suggest that so far Barbra Striesand in the movie is the best bet if its music you enjoy.
3,RETIRE DOLLY,"FIRST THE GOOD NEWS-THIS IS THE FIRST NEARLY COMPLETE RECORDING OF THE ""DOLLY"" SCORE INCLUDING ""THE WAITERS GALLOP"" THE FRANTIC AND ENERGETIC DANCE THAT PRECEDES THE TITLE NUMBER. NOW FOR THE BAD NEWS-WHETHER YOU LIKE HER OR NOT THE CHARM ABOUT CAROL CHANNING IS HER VOICE WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A STRANGULATED DUCK-ON THIS RECORDING AND WELL INTO HER SEVENTIES SHE SOUNDS MORE LIKE A COMATOSE DUCK. SO MY SUGGESTION IS BUY THE ORIGINAL CAST ALBUM WHEN HER UNUSUAL VOICE HAD ITS VIBRANCY AND BUY THIS FOR ITS COMPLETENESS WITH NOSTALGIA FOR WHAT USED TO BE."
3,just to have,"Now this trade is nothing spectacular in storyline, but there is one scene between Batman and Guy Gardner and the following few panels afterwards that really is a must have for Justice League history. The main reason for the purchase of the book was:1. I can't find the individual issues that I had.2. It shows Maxwell Lords first apperance far as I can find out.3. This is pretty much the premise for the mini-series ""Formaly the Justice League"" and it's follow up mini-series.4. Had to have since the JLA is re-starting for the ""umpteenth"" time, and the chances that these heroes beside Batman make it in the new league is slim to none since Idendity Crisis and Infinite Crisis."
4,Great Pattern Sprayer,We first bought a cheap pattern sprayer and it broken after a couple weeks. We bought this one and it works great. Easy to take the gun apart and clean it after use. Multiple holes for changing the sprayer pattern. Easy to hold the bucket when doing the ceiling. The only problem you need an extra hole clamp for the 45 degree elbow or else it will fall off.
5,Chanchaneando,"This record is amazing. I purchased it because of the premiere recording of Chan Chan, seven years prior to the Buena Vista Social Club soundtrack. The quality of the recording could not be better. It's engineered so tastefully that I imagine I can smell the wood grain of the instruments. The group's [Cuarteto Patria] original intent was to record the ""soneros"" of Cuban troubadour tradition. I feel like a lucky voyeur to be able to listen to such divinely inspired songs from the daily lives of generations of Cuban farmers."
2,"Little Action, Too Much Proselytizing","This is a religious book, not a detective story. It tracks the life of a patrol cop whose life is empty. His new partner is a born again Christian who recognizes he is suicidal and attempts a religious intervention. The description of Tony's experiences working the midnight shift in midtown Manhattan seem authentic, but there is little plot other than Tony finding the meaning of life. For those readers seeking a whodunnit or mystery novel, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
3,A fine discussion of this campaign,"This book tries to pack a lot into a small volume. It's well-written, with good background and a discussion of the impact of the fall of Acre (one of the last Crusader states) but it seems to dwell too much on charcters who are marginal at best to the overall story conveyed. With so little space to devote to the topic it just seems that more could have been done to stay focused on the overall topic. Still, the book is well-illustrated with original artwork, photographs of artififacts and locations and maps. Good for someone studying the Crusades."
3,Stanley 42-240 24-Inch Professional I-Beam Level,"Level looks good (it's yellow and not a red like on picture).When I check it, I found that one of acrylic vial covers screw is unscrewed there for is moved from alignment (1 point less for this). After I tighten it up, it show up correctly, both bubbles are aligned in center when measuring vertically.I notice that one of bubbles from edge acrylic vial covers is slightly shorter than another. So, one bubble is from edge to edge of inside lines, and another is 1mm less from each line. It still seating accurately in center, but it should be nicer to be really exact bubble on both ends (1 point less for this)."
4,Think Pack Should be thinner,I get how people love their TV shows. I like this one. I'm not interested in thick DVD cases though. This version is no thinner than the typical store shelf DVD. It's only 5 discs but it could take up the space of 3 cases. It should have been released in the ultra thin cases making the whole collection about 2 regular cases wide. There aren't any extra printed pieces in it. I just don't think this needs to be as bulky as it is.
3,Episodes not in chronological order,"While the quality of the DVD's is OK I found that the episodes are not in chronological order as advertised. Only the episodes on Disk 1 and Disk 5 are in the proper sequence. The episodes on the other three disks are somewhat jumbled, for example ""The Nox"" is listed as episode 12 but in reality it was shown as episode 7. Both the MGM and Showtime web sites have the proper order but whoever designed the set did not follow it."
5,AWESOME,The first boxed set is just awesome! I saw the original movie and the first pilot episode and just never bothered to watch the program on TV. Now I am absolutely hooked....time to get the other seasons!
5,outstanding sci-fi,"Stargate sg-1 is one of the best shows that has been placeed on the tv, and to have it on dvd is truily a tresure.Also to have in any coliction one would be forutianite, Not to enjoy it one would not like sci-fi or be a fool posibily BOUTH."
2,Does not advance the plot,"This is one of those episodes that are used to allow new viewers to catch up on past episodes by showing snippets and excerpts from said episodes. No doubt it is done nicely, and it garnered more viewers, and more viewers allowed this awesome show last 10 years.Sadly, now that it has been over a decade since it premeired, there is no need to ""catch up"" as most viewing will already be fans, and probably are watching it in a marathon sitting.You can safely skip this episode in my opinion, as it does not advance the plot, and is not interesting."
5,Love the series,"Richard Dean Anderson is who makes this a great series. He is the glue that holds everyone together. The episodes for the most part are very clever, and the concept of a gate to other planets is what makes it fun."
4,Stargate SG-1 is just good,"I had never seen the very first two episodes of SG-1. I was not disappointed. If you haven't seen how SG-1 was formed, then you must watch Children of the Gods: Parts 1 & 2."
4,Problem,"We enjoyed the episodes of Stargate SG1 very much, but there was a problem with one of the episodes involving Apophesis (sp?). It was the episode involving the Nox. Apophesis's voice was blanked out. We could see him speak, but not hear him."
4,Have the young ones skip the pilot episode,"My family and I have long watched Stargate SG-1 in syndication and on DVD (starting with season 4), so we decided to go back and watch them all from the beginning. We got a HUGE surprise when we encountered full frontal nudity in the pilot, and it wasn't just a passing scene. Enough people have lauded this series, which we still love, but please view the pilot before letting any children in your home see it.Had there been a description of the content of the pilot included with the set, I would have given this set five stars. All the other sets are five-stars in my book!The series does prompt some great discussions with the kids. There are clear distinctions between good and evil. The language gets spicier (more obscenity) as the seasons progress (probably from the origination on cable), but nothing beyond what our kids have heard in the neighborhood. That always gives us another opportunity to talk.Enjoy the series!"
5,Correction: Set only includes Season 1,(Correction: The 5-disc set includes all 22 episodes of season 1. It does not include season 2.)Fantastic. I will wait impatiently for seasons 2-5 to come out on DVD.
1,SG-1 is cool... MGM shafts fans...,"I am enormously disappointed in Season One, Stargate SG-1. I became a fan of Stargate during the 4th season.The main reason... the ONLY reason... why I am disappointed is that the last episode on the last disk is a ""TO BE CONTINUED"" episode. They did not include the episode in the Box set.3 Hours of TBC'ed on the last disk not to get the end? For $... I expected to see the last episode of Season one. Season one never airs, and season two is not out yet on DVD.Very disappointed about that.. What's even worse... I NOW have to get Season 2.At least the Saprano's Box Set includes the last episode."
4,Take a step into the Stargate,"When this show came on, I didn't have the Showtime network sadly. When it moved onto Sci-Fi, I didn't watch it either until much later. Lately, my dad brought the 2 first seasons and I got him the third season for Christmas and started to watch them in August. I must say, I was quite impressed at the show. Of course, I had the movie (not the direct-to-video movies) so I was a big fan of the concept. Richard Dean Anderson of MacGuyver fame stars as O'Neill as he commands SG1, a team that travels through the Stargate and explores other planets and battling the Goa'uld System Lords...namely Apothis. On the way, they meet the Asguard (which look like ""Greys"") and befriends one by the name of Thor. SG-1 also befriends Teal'c, who was Apothis' First Prime.Great Introduction of a series, and I look forward to getting the other seasons as well."
4,"Complete, but minimal extras","Missed it when it originally aired? Keep missing it in the reruns? This package delivers what it promises: the complete first season in 5 DVD's.The only problem with it is that there aren't very many extras on the discs. A few interviews or character bios, but that's about it.Get it if you want the collection or want to see what you missed, but don't get it looking for cool additional material."
3,sexy dress....cheaply made.,Sexy sexy dress....too bad they sent the wrong size and it runs small!!! I gave it to my 20year old daughter and it looks fabulous on her...however we had to get it fixed because it was unraveling under one of the breast!!! But for the price its a nice buy...
5,Shag is the Ultimate Movie,"I saw this movie as a pre-teenager and now, as an adult, I can say I have seen it at least 200 times AND know it, word for word. I first got hooked on the movie because Robert Rusler, who plays Buzz Ravanel, is absolutely gorgeous in this movie. He's sexy, suave, and a hot dancer. Then, I fell in love with the movie all over again because of Pudge and Chip; their budding romance is the sweetest ever! The movie is funny, touching, and absolutely the best. Gotta see it again, and again, and again! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
4,Loved Scott Coffey,"ok the movie was just like every spring break movie you had ever seen even the characters were the same the prim one, the slut, the one that used to be a duckling and became a swan, they all go to the beach to have one last fling before they go their own ways.the movie wasn't bad it just wasn't all that memorable. but all throughout the movie i kep screaming how much i loved chip (scott coffey) his character was so lovable. i wish i could find more movies he was in."
4,It is a great dance movie!,"It inspired us to visit Myrtle Beach and learn to Shag. We've seen it over a hundred times. Our favorite line is ""Go play in the trash liver lips,"" said by Chip about Nadine (Big Bob's partner). Our least favorite line is ""Why can't girls ask boys to dance?"" said by Pudge. I think girls can ask boys to dance."
3,"I love this movie, but...","The music on the DVD is all wrong! You've got to get the VHS version for the true ""SHAG"" experience."
1,Colloidal Silver Verification,"Before anyone takes anything associated with colloidal silver, please take the time to verify any claims associated with it and to search for reputable reports such as the Mayo Clinic and FDA (e.g. [...] ). I would not accept any reported claims without verified proof of validity. But that's just my cautious nature."
1,IT TURNS YOUR SKIN BLUE PERMANENTLY,"RESEARCH IT. There is a woman in my town whose SKIN TURNED SILVER-BLUE. She is NOT HAPPY. It has been 4-5 years and she had to get LASER SURGERY to get her skin to turn pink again.I don't know what to do but the word about this needs to be gotten out. [...]Just search for ""Calloidal Silver"" on Google, and then go to images. You will see real pictures."
3,"not a perfect solution, but my cat seems healthier","I bought this because my cat has chronic upper respiratory infections, and I wanted to try to avoid more antibiotics. After giving him the silver in his water for about 2 days, he was much better, and he has stayed that way. It seems to have affected his health very positively, but it did not clear up the problem entirely, so I will have to get antibiotics anyway. I will definitely use this as a way to treat him as soon as I see signs he might be getting sick, before the next infection takes root, though. I do think that it will be a good preventative, since it did make a good dent in his symptoms this time around.I found a less expensive and well-reviewed product that comes in a bigger bottle, and that is the only reason I am giving this product 3 stars and not 4. It is a bit pricey."
5,Hoping for a miracle.,The product is just as advertised. I'm hoping this will be the final answer after taking so may different supplements and meds. If it works I'll post again with rave reviews.
5,Negative reviews are amusing,"I have been taking this product heavily for over 12 years and have had no negative effects that are mentioned by others. I am amused that some people are so medical community oriented.I have had no colds or flu in those 12 years. On several occasions I have been in public places and contacted some factors that started to give me a sore throat. The throat symptoms were IMMEDIATELY removed upon a dropper full of the 500ppm colloidal silver. Sorry, but I am cheating doctors out of their high fees.My son has also used colloidal silver for about 8 years without flu or colds.Who are you going to believe?"
4,BB jay,"BB Jay's CD is on point! His beats will definitely will keep the listeners head bopping. However throughout the CD, BB Jay repeatedly confronts his 'haters'. Yea, he finally made it, but I don't think we need to hear it throughout the songs. Otherwise I'm really feeling this CD. I recommend it to all those who want hip-hop and not his slop. Ya'll should definitely get this album. Listen to #6. Peace!"
5,Beyond Platinum!,"How could you diss this compilation? Although this set is from 1996, it contains some of the best talent that Goldie and the Metalheadz camp have put out. This CD is pure venom. Would I recommend this? Hell yeah!!! The hardstep madness of ""This is Los Angeles"" by Lemon D will have you pressing ""repeat one"" on your CD player. In the immortal words of Justin Wilson.....""I GUARANTEE""!!! (insert smile here)"
1,Horrible!!,"It's a horrible movie.It just doesn't qualify as soft porn entertainment. The couple is below -average looking, sex scenes are in poor taste & don't even tickle where it should, love making is just completely absent. It is a poorly shot movie - contains just a short pathetic story of two jinxed folks with no love (& not even sex). One will find very few sex scenes which are in very poor taste & doesn't even arouse you. After watching the movie it gave me a headache - would rate playboy / basic instinct much better than this.Definitely not worth buying - believe me."
5,Excellent Character Study,Two damaged people trying to find love in an age where no-one dates anymore. Both Lauren Lee Smith and Eric Balfour make their characters believable.
3,Miscast male lead,My girlfriend and I looked forward to watching this movie. Premise sounded good.BUT We both agreed that Eric Balfour looked hideous in his sleazy moustache! He is sexy but not in this movie even though we were treated to full frontal nudity of him! Always a treat when you can find an actor willing to bear it all.So that is my complaint with the casting.Eric should have shaved the moustache. His character did nothing for us and we sure weren't interested in the females body parts.
4,Took my breath away,"This movie might be considered porn by some, but I believe its sooo much more than that. There is not a lot of dialogue, and that is actually what makes this movie for me. The intensity of the emotions, or even the lack thereof, portrayed in this movie make it much more than a grouping of sex scenes. I found this movie to be an artistic portrayal of a man and a woman's search for something more."
4,Think outside your normal routine box,"A friend of mine said I might like this movie. I found it on Netflix, ordered the DVD to come to my house & less than 30mins into the film I loved it."
3,"all right, not as good as The Mavericks version","Suprising. Over a dozen reviews here and no one mentioned The Mavericks/Trisha Yearwood version of this song, put on wax on the album called Music For All Occasions. If you are not a country music fan, don't worry; I'm not either (at least the crap country coming out of Nashville, that is), it doesnt matter. Go buy a copy of the cd. And listen to the best version of the song ever recorded. Believe it. As good as Robbie Williams voice might be, its nothing compared to Raul Malo's."
4,Sweet & Honey,"""Somethin' Stupid""is a very beautiful and joyful duet.Robbie's vocal is sweet and attractive.Nic's vocal is cute and lovely!Two's vocal is blended perfectly.And most of all,you can enjoy the video of this song(track 4).I bought this CD for the video.This is a must see!Orchestral version of ""Eternity""(track 2)is very elegant.Live version of ""My Way""(track 3)is moving.Even if you have Robbie's album""Swing When You're Winning"",you can enjoy this single very much.Besides fantastic video,other two songs are not included in his album.This is a worth paying for."
4,A popcorn movie that teaches. We need more like this.,"Mario Van Peebles ""Posse"" is a movie with flaws, but it treats its source material with respect. Unlike the shallow and silly ""Rosewood"" Van Peebles ""Posse"" gives viewers a clear picture of what life was like for African-American cowboys at the turn of the century. We get to know characters in the story. The production values are low budget, and several roles are miscast, but Van Peebles' heart is in every second of this film. He loves the material and wants us to learn as much about these forgotten black heroes as he has. Part ""spaghetti western"", part action flick, part historical drama, Posse is a lot of fun to watch. Mario Van Peebles, Billy Zane, Melvin Van Peebles and Salli Richardson in her first role are great. Tis one is worth owining for your collection."
2,someone has been listening to too much cat power,blah. a cross between tori amos and chan is too much for me
4,Great Movie overall but . . .,"We really loved the book and were very excited to see it with our 7 year old. She loved it to. Overall the movie was great and Matt Damon was wonderful as the father. The love interest was new (not in the book) but a welcome addition. And, of course, the animals are the best part. The one thing we couldn't understand is why they needed to throw in the gratuitous cussing, particularly from the little girl in the movie. Shock value we suppose but it just doesn't seem necessary and makes uncomfortable what would otherwise be a perfect movie for young kids."
3,ok,It is a nice movie for the family. You like to see the good people triumph through adversity and trials and they do.
2,Too sad!,This movie is not uplifting. It's just too sad. Mom dies before the movie ever begins. SAD! Automatic 2 stars. Don't waste your time. Not a fun movie.
5,"Of Course, We Bought a Zoo!","I could go on and on about the agnst that the family goes though is life changing, blah blah blah. But I LOVE this movie. It is a great premise with great actors and a great director and, hey, it's just a great movie. Buy it, watch it, love it, put it back in, watch it again, love it again, and when the family goes to bed, pop it in one more time, and......I can't wait till it is released, cuz I'm gonna buy it! How many stars can we give it? What ever it is, I would give it more!"
5,We Bought a Zoo,The viewing quality was great and the process of renting movies from Amazon was quick and easy. We will be renting from Amazon again!
4,Great film with great messages,"This seemed like a sleepy (and syrupy) drama at first, but there were some amazing thoughts and lessons that came through. So refreshing to see a movie about someone who struggles and overcomes great obstacles, not to mention that it's based on a true story. I'll never forget the ""five seconds of insane courage"" quote. That really sealed the deal."
4,We Bought A Zoo,This is a great movie. It is a real history. The movie was made perfectly and the actors are doing a great job. The quality of the movie was perfect.Thanks
3,Mh. Ok.,"Nothing special but entertaining enough. [Apparently, you cannot leave reviews that are too short but, seriously, there's nothing else to say about this movie!]."
4,We Bought A Zoo,It was a wonderful movie about changing lives and positive choices and letting new experiences happen. Very great movie that was based on a true story.
2,Total waste,What pablum; Matt Damon must have been hard up for some kind of payment or other. A real yawner. Great for insomnia.
4,"Good, clean, fun, meaningful",Good for all family members. It is nice to see a movie that does not have gratuitous sex and violence. One that shows how folks can work together to achieve and build. A really enjoyable film.
5,Great Family Movie,Watched this with kids age 7 and 11 they both loved it also. Would watch over and over again. Based on a true story also.
5,We bought a Zoo,Movie arrived in the expected time frame. This was a great movie and we made it a family night favorite.
1,Arrived broken.,"I returned it. Haven't heard anything so far. The case was broken, so I did not romove the cellophane wrapper"
1,Boring and not interesting,"I really wasn't interested at all by this movie. For a family movie, it does have a few curse words in it. Plus the 13 yr old's drawings were disturbing... but that isn't the whole reason I gave this movie a one star. It was just a waste of time for me."
5,The Zoo,Great movie. enjoyedd very much. I ordered it for my two grandaughters. I had heard nothing but good coments about the movie.
5,touching,sad but also inspirational well told story. Creative and fun. I would definitely recommend this movie to others as I enjoyed it very much.
1,Boring Plot with Insipid Dialogue,"I was really looking forward to watching this film. It has so many good reviews on this site. However, it was so boring that I couldn't stay with it until the end. The dialogue came across as forced and awkward. Often, it appeared the actors didn't even want to say their insipid lines. ""We Bought a Zoo"" was a huge let down because I was expecting so much. This is the worst Matt Damon film I have ever seen. I wish I had saved my money and not bought the ""Zoo."""
4,Good clean fun,"Good family movie, with solid acting and entertaining moments. All my family enjoyed it. Although some of the plot turns were less than surprising, the movie was still really fun to watch."
3,We Bought a Zoo,Movie was OK but not as interesting as we had hoped. Matt Damon is a favorite actor in this family.
5,Fantastic Movie,"Truly a fantastic movie for people of all ages. It is my new favorite movie and I throw it on whenever I have a bad day. Just a great pick-me-up. This disk gives you four ways to watch it - blue ray, dvd, digital copy, Voodoo - so its compatible with future and past players."
4,We bought a Zoo,"I enjoyed this one in spite of it's flaws. Yes, it was pretty corny at times and how convenient that the zoo they bought comes with a good looking zookeeper the same age as him and one his son's age too. But the story was interesting, the animals fun to watch and it was a good escape for a couple hours on a rainy night."
2,great concept but tried too hard and child actor = annoying,"I tried to like this family comedy-drama but couldnt stomach it after Mr Mee bought the zoo. It all went downhill from then on mainly due to poor pacing and thetoo cutesy performance of Rosie Mee. Matt Damon did a good job as the harried widower but it wasn't enough to make this a ""must see"" family drama. Even if you have nothing else to do ... pass on this. Dont believe the other reviewers!!!"
5,35 years on it still sounds fresh,"I'm like many of the reviewers. I have this album from it's release on vinyl too.Wonderous stuff this. The 1st side is almost a continuous piece, including a ballistic percussion solo from Billy.If you like high energy stuff, you won't keep still to ""The Pleasant Pheasant"" (A dynamic sax solo on this track by the late, great Michael Brecker).One of my all time favourite albums.He is wonderful ""live"" too if you ever get the chance to see him."
5,A Very Excellent Film by Possibly America's Greatest Film-Maker,"Michael Moore has confirmed my personal views of many of the Americans that I have met. This is a great film. It is very well made, and will stand the test of time. I watch this movie a lot. It's so extraordinary. I recommend this film to everyone."
5,My favorite comedy!,"This movie is downright hilarious! I couldn't understand why it fell flat in the theaters. I mean not only is this hilarious, but also John Candy's last film before his death.I can hardly wait to own this on DVD this Christmas!"
1,Not even worth watching on the telly!,"I heard about the making of this movie since it was practically filmed not far away from my hometown. Given that it involved western New York and southern Ontario, I thought it would be a good thing.Oh, was I proven wrong. I didn't get a chance to watch it in theatres, but I did watch it on VHS with a few friends back in late 1995. This movie just could not hold my attention (or theirs, for that matter) nor was it anywhere close to have us laughing in stitches. I don't care if it was meant to be Michael Moore's way of being perpetually condescending and opposed to conservatives or if this movie had been done by a conservative. It just flat out wasn't worth the money to rent it for wasting our time to watch it.According to Wikipedia, it appears that the film didn't win any Razzies. That's unfortunate, because it was well-deserving of a few Razzie awards (if not all of them)."
3,A mixed bag from the master,"The Bottom Line:Ran's gorgeous photography and impressive first hour may be just enough to recommend it despite the fact that its King Lear-meets-Japanese-folk-legend plot doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, the closing battle scenes aren't staged very well (men on horses ride toward the enemy, men get shot, men fall off horses, horses are all fine) and the 160-minute running length often feels interminable; know what you're getting into before you watch this dubious classic.3/4"
1,Give Me A Break,"The audio track is in Japanese, and the Subtitles are only in French and Spanish.Someone please tell me what use this disc is to anyone."
4,Ran,"I enjoyed watching ran. it was quite different than most American films in a lot of ways. it had an unique combination of humor and drama. I particularly liked the large battle scenes. i think a lot of the epic battle scenes in movies that i like now were heavily influenced by this film. this film has an interesting mix of both American and foreign film styles. The influence of Japanese Noh theater is clearly strong. While some American audiences might be put off by some aspects of the film, i still think it reaches a wide, diverse audience nonetheless."
5,Finest Movie Ever Made,"If you have yet to see Akira Kurosawa's Ran, then go buy it. Now.This is, in the opinion of many, the finest movie ever made. It is easy to see why so many hold this view, as it combines great writing (It's based on Shakespeare's King Lear afterall), incredibly cinematography (the reason it is ONLY availible in widescreen in that Kurosawa is one of the only directors who knew how to use the letterbox format), and great action.At the time of it's filming it was the most expensive Japanese movie ever made, and it shows. The costumes were given great attention, as were the spectacular battle scenes, all involving thousands of fully costumed extras. The battle scene in which no sound effects were used creates an incredible amount of tension and shows the collapsing mind of King Hidetora literally.All in all this is one of the best movies ever. Buy it NOW!"
5,beware of this DVD,"without a doubt we all know this movie is more then excellent, but if you already own the VHS tape of Ran then beware of this DVD! the quality doesn't do the film justice, the subtitles are part of the transfer (they can't be turned off) and are sometimes hard to read, there is only a chapter search and you can't scroll through the chapter if you're in the middle of watching the movie. no clock will be displayed on your DVD player also, weird."
1,BOYCOTT THIS CRAP!!!,"This is the product of Studio Canal's treachery to the Criterion Collection! THIS BLU-RAY is the reason why we don't have Ran on Criterion anymore!I can wait until this piece of trash edition passes into OOP status and the Studio Canal jerks return the rights to Criterion, thanks."
1,"Excellent News from Criterion!! (dvd review, film is a 5)","Visited the Critereon Collection website today, April 4, 2005. Critereon just released Kurosawa's ""Kagemusha"" on DVD and the press release also read: ""Kurosawa fans can also look forward to Criterion's upcoming edition of Ran, due out in late 2005 in a special edition which includes, among other features, an exclusive interview recently conducted in Tokyo with star Tatsuya Nakadai.""EXCELLENT NEWS!! For those sorely dissapointed by the two previous editions of Ran on DVD this could not come as better news! No word yet on other extras or number of discs. There is a chance, of course, like past Critereon releases that they could lose the license quickly (reverts back to studio that owns the film) and that it could be run in limited quantities (like ""Straw Dogs"" was).Hope this makes the discussion on the so-called Masterworks version versus the Fox Lorber edition moot. Finally this film will get the DVD treatment it deserves."
5,A work of art,This is the most beautiful film I have ever seen. I almost wept at the beauty of it. I fully fully fully demand you see it.
2,Poor design,"I am a do it yourself person and usually ends up with tools for every project. The project for which this was purchased was putting in 30 can lights throughout our house. Looking back at it, I should have gone with something that can cut holes quickly and without creating a mess....anyway....this tool is good for marking a circle in the drywall but it doesn't have the ability to cut all the way through. I ended up using a drywall saw on every hole. Useless tool in my opinion."
4,"""A flute, two guitars, grits 'n' eggs...to go.""","The 1969 Tom Dowd-produced Memphis Underground is an enjoyable jazz-soul effort from Mann, thanks largely to the contrasting guitars of Larry Coryell & a youthful Sonny Sharrock, along with the grits 'n' eggs contributions of sessioneers Bobby Wood, Tommy Cogbill, Bobby Emmons & Reggie Young. Good listening even though the recording doesn't heat up as often as one would like.For a little more hot sauce, try tracking down the out-of-print ""Hold On, I'm Coming,"" recorded live at the 1972 New York Jazz Festival, also featuring Sharrock.Bob Rixon, WFMU"
4,Excellent movie,"This movie has another title called Farewell Friend, it is played with French actor Alain Delon, it may seem a little long during a particular sceen but the movie is great overall."
1,Poor quality.,I am very disappointed in the quality of this movie. The color is washed out and the sound is very poor.
3,A Little to Country!,"Steve James plays country style blues with a hint of Bluegrass. He is joined on this recording by guitarist Alvin Youngblood Hart (Big Mama's Door-Territory and Start with the Soul), Dobro Player Cindy Cashdollar (5 CD's with Leon Redbone, Artie Traum, Livingston Taylor and others) and harp player Gary Primich (7cd's including Hot Harp Blues, Company Man and Brothernation.) While born and raised in New York, James moved from New York to Tennessee at the age of 23, where he honed his guitar skills playing with Bukka White, Walter Lewis and RL Burnside. The CD contains 6 originals penned by James and 7 covers. While this CD is well done it is a little to country for me. If you like Bob Brozman, Artie Traum, Bukka White or Livingston Taylor, chances are you will like this CD as well."
2,Typical mid-60s Elvis musical,"FRANKIE AND JOHNNY is better than the previous two films (TICKLE ME and HARUM SCARUM), but that doesn't mean that it succeeds on all levels.Elvis looks quite comfortable in the costumes he wears in this picture, but the lousy dialogue and dumb plotline are anything but brilliant.The songs are okay, but nothing outstanding. Only ""Please Don't Stop Loving Me"" could succeed on it's own.It's not as bad as some of the other Elvis pictures of the era, but it's not an essential addition to anyone's collection."
3,Frankie and Johnny,I remember this movie when I was younger. If you like Elvis I guess you will ove this movie. Some of the songs I really enjoy.
2,"Not only mindless,","but stupid and mindless. Presley was never an actor, and proves it once again here. But the songs are even worse than his acting. There are no good ones. None. Not even the title song, whioch was never a major hit for him. The rest of the cast is the usual melange of unknowns or semi-knowns who either totally non-act, or overact with the extremely limited talent they have. Only Harry Morgan, who was likely the only really talented one in the bunch (OK, Strauss to a degree, too) seemed to be having a good time; it's almost as if he went into the movie with a ""Hell, it's a paycheck"" attitude. The ending goes beyond trite into fantasy. And what can you say about Donna Douglas? Well, she was slightly better here than as Ellie May Clampett. But that's like saying one shade of battleship gray is a bit less dull than the other. The humor in the Beverly Hillbillies rarely, if ever, developed from her. Catch this on TV if you have a few minutes to kill."
1,Strictly for fans of academic Political Correctness,"If you like Star Trek, you will probably hate this book. It drones on for what seems like forever in an academic time warp of jargon and irrelevancies. For readers interested in the background history of the original Star Trek series, this is NOT the best book to read. Many other histories of the series are far better. For readers who do not consider race to be a ""social contruct"" but rather a biological reality underpinning a social superstructure, this book will be infuriating."
5,Wild Fire,"Another lovely CD by Hubert. Love his music. With Herbie Mann, the only people able to adroitly play jazz on the flute."
2,Works poorly with iPod nano 4th generation,"Functionally, the product worked as intended. My iPod nano 4th Gen was able to send R/L signals to my stereo using this product.However, they made the housing of the the 3.5mm plug so big, it can't be plugged in at the same time as the USB adapter. So either I can use the iPod with the stereo, or it can be charging via a USB power adapter. But not both. So now I have to remember to perform a cable switch every time I turn on or turn off my iPod.For those who don't know, iPod nano 4th Gen has the USB and 3.5mm jacks right next to each other on the bottom of the unit.Some of the blame lies at Apple's feet as they put those two connectors so close. But Belkin made the plug housing far larger than most 3.5mm plugs are these days. Apparently in effort of having a sleek design. I'd rather it work with the highest-selling nano to date."
3,Belkin mini-plug to RCA plugs,"This cable works fine, my only complaint is that the metal shroud around the area where the mini-plug connects to the cable comes unscrewed easily and has to be tightened occasionally."
3,good music,Method Man rocks as usual. His lyrics are thought provoking and really raw. I would suggest you buy this album for good listening. Word.
2,Annoying speaker.,"He says something as if it is in ""quotation marks,"" in EVERY sentence. Who talks like that? Gets to be distracting.Also, he references ""study after study"" frequently, but I would love to hear him cite a study.My main gripe with him is his speaking habit of quoting one-third to one-half of each sentence. You'll know what I mean when you listen to him speak about ANYTHING. No other speaker does this."
3,Overpriced,"I purchased this toy online for my 5-year-old because I couldn't find it at our local stores. It is tiny, and extremely overpriced. After I purchased it, the local Target store started carrying the exact toy and only charges $4.89 for it. I feel like I got ripped off."
2,Hippies,"Any song that contains a lyric like ""Well there's a rose in the fisted glove and the eagle flies with the dove,"" should be ridiculed, especially in a song that advocates the point of view that it's OK to sleep around on your wife as long as she doesn't know about it. I'm sure this one has been discussed in junior high poetry classes for decades. Stills was a talented guitarist and his work with Buffalo Springfield holds up pretty well, but stuff like this clearly demonstrates why CS&N were always trying to get Neil Young to hang out with them."
4,"Klein 5102-24 Canvas Tool Bag, 24-Inch","I've used the Klein 5102 24-inch canvas bags for years. I have found them to be very well made and durable. At one time, I only used one to carry my hand tools to work every day, but once I discovered that it was also the perfect size to store my climbers, work gloves, rope lanyard, pole strap, extra gaffs and wrenches all in the same bag, I have been using one for that purpose as well. I have one of these bags that is probably close to 20-years old now and still in use. Over the years, I've repaired a few small holes in the canvas with a Speedy Stitcher awl and replaced the four rivets that hold the leather handles on, but other than that it is all original and still in one piece. These bags aren't cheap, but I think they are worth the expense because they have proven to me that they can hold up over time, so I would have no problem recommending them."
2,Pretty but difficult to use,"I like the slide design, however, it makes the phone very top-heavy. This makes it difficult to text message with one hand. I also don't like the buttons. There is very little ridge detail between the numbers, so it is difficult to be sure you are pressing the correct number."
2,Don't Like Mine,I do not like my Strawberry Chocolate. The touch sensitive buttons do things when you don't even touch them. When I receive or place a call the mute screen pops up on its own. My camera quality is poor. If it wasn't so expensive to get a different phone I would.
5,Life Changing!,"Weaving the Visions is one of those rare books that changed my life! It totally turned my spiritual worldview upside down--from patriarchal Christianity to an appreciation of the Goddess worshipping religions and how to incorporate the feminine loving side of paganism into Christianity, Judaism and other faiths. I would highly recommend this book to any religious person, feminist person and anyone else looking to be blown away! :)"
1,Horribly written,Does not read well. Poorly phrased and overly annotated. Two many hands trying to write in one book. Ideas and concepts get lost. Also states opinion as fact. Got offended more than once. Not a good source. Save you money and time! Avoid!
2,What is so special about Kava?,"I've just read that title and wonder what do some people like in Kava's novels? A simple story? Gore? Melodrama? ""She had a look at his strong legs and surprised she noticed that she liked them."" (sorry, I'm not a native speaker and I read it translated to Polish, but that is a fine example of the author's ""prose""). If you like other Kava's books you will probably like this one too, but if you didn't go for Thomas Harris, Dean Koontz or Jeffrey Deaver and other master story-tellers: one page of their prose is often more interesting than this entire novel."
3,Good but not Great,"I love the Maggie O'Dell novels. Ms. Kava's story lines are unique and interesting and I like that she paces the development of her characters - those things keep me coming back! But AT THE STROKE OF MADNESS felt hurried to me. I was surprised by how much of the book was back story, dropped like a rock as soon as a character from a previous book was introduced.The book still offers good twists and turns, has a very creative serial killer, and Ms. Kava keeps us guessing about his identity until the book's end. The epilogue was a nice touch, as well.I'll keep coming back, but hope the books are a little longer, a little better developed, in the future."
3,At The Stroke of Madness,"I am an Alex Kava fan and loved her first two books. However, I am still waiting for the loose ends to be tied up from the first book. If this new book doesn't continue and tie in what kept me coming back for more, and satisfy my curiosity about the characters still in limbo, I won't purchase her again."
2,Ordinary Read,"I love the first two books by Alex kava but this one seems so ordinary. The ending seems like it is rushed. Like the editor/publisher is rushing her to finish. There is no suspense like the two previous books. The characters are not well develeoped. Lillian, Calvin and Wally had so much introduction than basically disappeared into the story. The relationship between Gwen and Tully also seems to be rushed. This is not a great read, might as well borrow it from the library and not spend the money."
5,Fantastic,"Love every book so far, can't wait to read the next in line. Alex kava is my next favorite author."
5,windysu,it is my alltime favorite -- to be able to hear Gershwin himself play Rhapsody in Blue is worth EVERYTHING....great CD and great music
5,Great Metallica Shirt!,I bought my husband Metallica concert tickets for his birthday and got this shirt to go with them. He loves it! It is well made and fits him perfectly.
5,Classic!,"This is a classic shirt, and its condition is brand new. It was a perfect gift, and very well recieved. Awesome!"
4,Classic artwork on an adequate shirt,"I think the shirt looks great. But the shirt is too small for a XXL, and the material is a little thin. If you are going to get this legendary shirt, it's advisable to get it one size over."
5,Enjoy a white Chrismas comedy,"Christmas Mail is a breeze between movies with full violence, blood, dead people and nasty bad words. It's a movie to enjoy with your kids and family, it's a white and sweet movie.Emily is an orphan, her uncle Matt (A.J. Buckley) is raising her since the loss of her parents, and she writes letters to Santa Claus asking him for a company for him. To the post office arrives a mysteryous woman (Ashley Scott)which work is answer the letters that arrives to the post mail office for Santa.She is a very nice woman that helps everybody but avoids talk about her life, her past.The Post office chief sends matt to spy on her, the problem is that Matt falls in love with Kristi.Ashley has a funny role and portrait a sweet and innocent woman that loves Christmas spirit, Rolonda Watts plays a great role as Matt & Kristi friend."
2,A Flawed Book,"Don't buy this book: it is ""printed to order"" and my copy had several pages missing - on Liszt too. I e-mailed the publisher three times asking for photocopies of the missing pages but got no answer."
5,My all time favorite,"My all time favorite perfume. Jennifer Lopez has not made a scent better than this! All others seem somewhat cheap, but this scent is awesome!"
1,Too strong: Old lady-ish,"I bought this perfume for Christmas not knowing how it smelled. Jennifer Lopez's perfumes are usually light smelling and beautiful, but this one is too strong and smells like an old folk's home blew up. Everywhere."
1,Poor package quality conditions,"Unfortunately, for the first time I must rate negatively a product purchased from Amazon LLC. The inner package came completely damaged (actually torn and the liquid was leaking). It is unacceptable."
5,I love Bette Midler,"I am so glad that I purchased this CD. Great value, quick ship and brought back tons of memories!"
4,Big Book of Sales Games,Great book filled with interesting activities for any sales meeting. Can't wait to start using it!
2,INCONSISTENT PERFORMANCE CAUSES AGGRAVATION,"I finaly bought this DVD player for myself after researching several models. Although it was not one of the most expensive, I was expecting it to still get the job done. Well, I sure was wrong. It is even enough to set up, but that was about the only plus. Sometimes it would play certain DVD's, sometimes it wouldn't. The ones that did play would take several minutes to get started, especially because the remote does not register what you press right away."
5,Trooper.,"Has been running well for eleven years! Easy to setup, looks and sounds good. Buy one if you can. Nothing else to say."
5,This CD is good!,"I guess this is a a love it or hate it type of album but i am firmly in the LOVE IT group! This band has its own unique sound. Definitlely a dark metal type of prog music. I listened to the clips from the band's website first. These are strong songs. The band did a good job creating unique songs, they don't sound the same like some groups. What does this band sound like....Some Fates Warning, maybe some Queensryche thrown in but overall just good music that any fan of this genre should enjoy. Do not be fooled by these 1 star reviews, they are an injustice."
2,Horribly mastered,"I can't hear her voice over the background music. I don't have this problem with other dvds and I tried adjusting my sound settings, but it didn't help. I realize her instruction isn't absolutely necessary, but it's annoying."
3,Decent,It's convenient because each session is only 10 minutes BUT the instructor goes SO FAST. There's only about 2 sessions that I can do because the moves are easy enough that I can mock her without much explanation. Quick and frustrating!
3,Charming Obscurity,"This, one of Haydn's many and largely unknown operas, is by far one of the most charming. It features many tuneful arias and far less in the way of cumbersome recitative than the other operas. Most of all, it is far less strange than, say, Il Mondo Della Luna, his most bizarre creation.The performances on this recording are far from perfect, being much what one would expect for a recording of such a rare piece. However, they pass muster not too badly for the conossieur of Haydn's works for the operatic stage.This recording is unlikely to appeal to anyone but the afficiondo."
5,"Sometimes it jus has 2 b gangsta, gangsta.","To be truly honest i know a lot of people think 'Hell On Earth' is the Mobb's best album but if someone were to ask me then i would undoubtably say it's 'Murda Muzik'. Yeah, the beats may carry the same style as all the other Mobb albums but isn't that the reason people keep koppin em'?Sometimes with all the mainstream hip-pop rap goin about you jus need something that is truly street and grimy to thug out to and this album is exactly that.Havoc doesn't fail in his producin skills as 'Where Ya Heart At' is a gem on this album and also with Alchemist producin 2 songs (Murda Muzik & The Realest) how can you go wrong.Bottom line is, great album and i dont juz giv 5 stars for nothing so if you like hardcore tru rap, kop this otherwise, cop Ja Rule's latest effort. One!"
4,This CD is the best CD ever to come from Mobb Deep.,"This CD is awesome. The music is very well put together, and the beats are very nice, along with good lyrics, all these things together make this a classic record."
1,CAN'T SEE HOW THIS ALBUM GOT 4 & A HALF STARS !!!,THE ONLY TRACK I LIKE IS QUITE STORM.THE REST OF THIS ALBUM (was bad).THE EAST COAST IS WEAK.
5,Murda Mobb,"I love this album they released it after two classics they where murda mobb on this album this a classic I love ""Quietstorm""and ""Spread love""."
3,"the book was a good, I thought I was there","Good book, well I don't know much else to say, I read it a long time ago, but I remember being enthrulled with it; I couldn't put it down!"
5,I like the backstreet boys because they are a good singer,I like the Backstreet boys because they are a good singer and a good roure model for kids and teenagers too
5,"It was a really good book, it told all on the BSB.","This book was really, really good! I re-read it about three times, it kept me hooked reading about their stories on how they made it to the top. I know they will be around forever. Keep the Backstreet Pride Alive!!!"
5,Absolutely a heart stealer! Those glossy pics are ACE!!!!,"The best biography I've ever read. I've been a fan for 1 & a half years and never have I read a better biography about this group, Backstreet Boys, in my life. Glosyy pics are bound to steal your heart away!!! Regina K [kertfr@compuserve.com]Melbourne, Australia"
2,disappointment,"Ms. Muller's books get a lot of stars, so I was expecting something memorable. This is not it, maybe because it was an early book? The characters don't make sense, particularly sharon's relationship with a cop, who is first nasty (in a way that i would consider ""over the top"" for teasing) and later becomes just as inexplicably friendly. This was very jarring for the reader. I kept wondering why the beneficiary of the will, rather than the executor, was making legal decisions about the estate -- doesn't everyone know that there has to be an executor? this mistake bothered me. Regarding the actual antiques, while I don't really know, I find it hard to believe that business is conducted in the way described. All in all, pretty unpolished."
5,Healthier hair.,"Female 26 years of age: I got this shampoo because initially I became paranoid that my hair was thinning. I have very fine hair anyway, but my baby hair around the hairline seemed less dense than usual, thus making me feel like I was balding. After finishing one 8oz. bottle of Nisim shampoo, I ordered a giant 33oz. bottle, not only because my head seems to be as hairy as before, but also because my fine, dull, and impossibly tangly hair is now actually much more brushable and shiny. The length seems to have hastened as well and I no longer panic and obsess about thinning hair. Would like to eventually try the conditioner as well."
1,doesn't help at all,does not do any wonders...it rather weighs your hair down and makes it look flatter and thinner. Have been using for 3 weeks now..still no change!
3,Loking Backward To Tomorrow,"Includes live and studio recordings. Side 1: Celluloid Heroes, The House Is Burning, Scared To Be Alone, Rocelli Kaharunta. Side 2: Feet, The Magician, Cocaine Blues."
5,Standard Issue in Anthro Classes,"This book, and others from the entire excellent series, was required reading in both my undergrad and graduate Anthropology courses. Essential concepts and methods, easy to understand, very relate-able...I recommend for anyone who wants to learn a little something about Anth."
5,Very good for understanding the subject,"The book provides very clear explanations about different aspects of financial statement analysis. The only drawbacks are that the book is a little simplistic and that problem solutions are sorely needed. However, I am sure you are not going to use oit for self-study- you would be using it as a textbook in a financial statement analysis class. The professor, would be able to provide you with solutions (as in my case- thanks Dr. Church!) and will also help you out with some of the tougher stuff. Whatever, the book does an excellent job in explaining the basic stuff- much better than the Sondhi book."
3,"Quite good actually, although not perfect","Easy to digest lessons; nice lay-out (at least in my edition) and you can listen to parts of the audio without actually having to look in the book. I like that the author has includes hints (hinto) and study-tips. What it lacks is kana and kanji. (One chapter will introduce you to a few kana and 17 kanji; 1-10 and the days of the week, but in my opinion you'll need more than that.) Also it wouldn't hurt with a little bit more audio. I think it's a nice investment although hardly the best book out there and absolutely not essential when it comes to learning Japanese."
2,Repair Costs!!!,"A little over one year ago I purchased a Workcentre 390 and was pleased with the performance until, for no apparent reason, a ""Fuser Error"" appeared. I contacted Xerox and the cost to repair this is in excess of [money]. The copier was used only occasionally, not even one toner cartridge replaced."
1,More Stanley Junk,"I too purchased one of these fine looking levels. I used it only a few times since I'm not a professional tradesman! My bubbles have also grown increasingly longer. One vial only has a few drops of liquid left in it. There is no sign of leakage! The liquid is just gone.As the other reviewer states, replacement vials are impossible to find!SHAME ON YOU STANLY TOOLS!You might get 2 years out of it before the vials start to dry up but that will be about it!"
4,"Not a Beach boys recording, but it has several good points.","The song beach boy is quite enjoyable and the live tracks are okay. It has computer enhancements which are rather clever.""beach boy"" and studio performances of the live tracks appear on the album ""Raygun Suitcase"", which after repeated listenings I find quite satisfying.incidently ""Raygun Suitcase"" does contain a very basic performance of ""Surfer Girl"" that wouldn't sound much out of place on the Beach Boys album ""Wild Honey"".This EP and the album are no longer in print, pere ubu and Tim/Kerr parted ways because of a legal dispute, someday they may be re-issued. Cross your fingers but don't hold your breathe, any album released since 1988 up to ""pennsylvana"" just doesn't seem to get back into issue once discontinued.Why the song was entitled ""beach boy"" isn't apparent to me as beach boy or surf references are not mentioned."
2,basic,"This book doesn't even come close to what you need to know for the service and support exam. The net tech section is about half and half. Do not rely on this book to pass the S&S exam. Get some good Old, (yes dated, the exam questions are) Novell books on the subject you will be much better off."
5,Great Toaster,Very durable toaster. I've had it for the past 7 years. Still like new. Stainless steel makes it a nice addition to any kitchen.
3,Also included in Monster War,"This novella is included in ""Monster War"", an edition that includes ""Sir Stalwart"", ""The Crooked House"" and ""Silvercloak"". Happily I found the story line somewhat familiar and avoided rebuying, as I quite enjoy Duncan's work and was looking forward to a new installment of the King's Blades."
5,How Much Do You Trust Your Doctor?,"This is the best book by Wensley Clarkson that I have ever read! The writing is so detailed and so well organized, that I had a very difficult time putting it down!Clarkson relays the story of Fred Shipman who, in 2000, was convicted of 15 murders; deaths that occured on his watch as their doctor after he induced their untimely demise with overdoses of morphine. Although convicted of only fifteen, it is believed that Shipman is responsible for more than 350 deaths.In addition, Clarkson does a marvelous job of giving readers an inside view to Shipman's family and tries to relay to the reader how, despite they are still living, they too are victims of this horribly depraved man.I highly recommend reading this book if you enjoy true crime. Not only is it entertaining, but will serve as an eye-opener into how one should never place one hundred percent trust in their doctor."
5,Brilliant early SF punk rock,"The Sleepers were it!!! Ricky Williams had a fantastic voice (check out his stuff with the Toiling Midgets on ""Sea of Unrest"" as well) and the band played heavy proto-punk, Stooges-style riffs -- particularly on the first five tracks (the original, legendary ep -- the later tracks actually are more in a Joy Division, post-punk vein). The early SF punk scene was simply incredible -- the Sleepers, Crime, Avengers, Negative Trend, Mutants, Dils, Nuns, Offs, etc. Great stuff."
4,More fun horror!!!,I enjoyed all 3 movies. I will admit Dragonwyck is not really a horror movie and that Chandu is more matinee adventure than horror but I did enjoy them as part of the set.Dr.Renaults Secret is a solid horror movie that is worth having this set for alone. It is a good story well directed and acted.The extras on each one are nice also I really like the commentary on Chandu and found it very informative.All in all a great purchase and hours of entertainment.
2,NOTHING NEW HERE!,"Nope. No amazing revelations. No juicy gossip. No dissing and hissing. What you get is the story (that everyone already knows) about three hard-working musicians from Toronto who made it big on the arena rock circuit. Loved by millions, and still in the business after 30 years, these guys are friends who love touring and playing their music for their fans. End of story. I guess that is the problem with Rush: they didn't get into the biz for the fame, money, and excess. Got in it for the career...boring. These guys are really accomplished musicians, but you are not going to find any of the wild tales that made the Stones, the Who, or Led Zeppelin legends. Treating being in a rock band on the same level as, say, running a law firm does take all the fun out of it. So, pass this one by, unless you want to hear about that story again about these hard-working musicians from Toronto who made it big..."
4,Must for Rush Fans,Great for all Rush fans only. It's easy to read and enjoyable. Answers some questions but not all. It's still fun! Peace
3,"Interesting factoids, atrocious writing","There is plenty of information in here for the die-hard fan, but Popoff's writing is awful. It's like he had no editor to rein in his purple prose. His fawning descriptions of each album induce cringes."
3,"Does its job, but left some questions unanswered.","I enjoyed reading this book and was glad to learn what I did from it, but I felt like it could have had more details. I learned about certain aspects of their live career, sure, but I wanted some elaboration on how this song here was pivotal or how this tour here made them change as people. I mainly wanted to know more about their experiences on the road and how they managed to remain professional despite their adverse living conditions, rather than hear a little about what they did in their spare time. It's still worth reading though. It may change your perspective about the albums by telling you things about them you might not have noticed."
2,Tedious & Stock,"All of the negative reviews you have read here are true. As a 26 year Rush fan, I was dying to get this, and then was grateful I bought it with a gift card. I've read numerous Popoff interviews over the years, and I expected much more. As for the band, they seem as bored interviewing for this book as I was reading it!"
2,Not for Oral Boards,"This book would be beneficial for radiologists I am sure at some point in their career in neuroradiology. However, since most of us look at the case review series for our oral boards this is not the best book in the series for us. The first set of cases which is normally easy is actually very difficult and would be much harder than the ones I assume (hope) we will see on the oral boards."
5,Making Order of Chaos,"Travelling to Rome for the first time, I had this sense of dread and excitement. There is so much to see and do, and a limited time to do all of this. Caput Mundi gives this wary traveller a sense of direction, flow and priority that would otherwise be difficult to derive from anything short of a personal tour guide. Peter Melaragno (can you imagine how many PE teachers killed his name in junior high in Rhode Isalnd?) walks us through strata of historical and cultural chaos of a city built upon many others. This comes with two DVD's - the travelogue, and the detailed walking tour, complete with maps, cursors and real time reference of sights, sounds and tastes. There are enough recommendations to book lodging in the heart of it all. I will travel with his pocket guide - a printed text of his walking tour - (included with the two DVDs) in one hand, and a folding laminated map of old Rome in the other. Carpe Diem..."
1,Horrible...Stay away!,"Besides most of these being defective at time of purchase...the sound quality is horrible and is very user unfriendly. I owned this for three days too long. You'll think the glide is kind of cool at first, but try driving and making any kind of sound adjustments. It's a pain. This should be a 0 Star rating but that option was unavailable. Get a Pioneer...very user friendly and sounds great. I have the Pioneer 8600 and it's about the same price and you won't be disappointed."
2,Don't bother,"After reading the glowing reviews here, I was excited to read a fresh new author. How wrong I was. ""Patricia Cornwell at her best""? Please. Patricia Cornwell IS the best, and this book can't even come close. Jilliane Hoffman may have been a fantastic Assistant State Attorney and Regional Legal Advisor for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, but as an author of crime fiction she needs a lot of work. I'd like some retribution of my own, for reading such a poorly-written book."
4,It is like a long CSI tale written by Rob Zombie,"It made me put it down after 150 pages once the legal mumbo jumbo started, but then a couple of plot twists made me finish the last 60% of it in one sitting. It is twisted."
4,One of the scariest books I have ever read!,"Jilliane Hoffman really knows how to keep your attention in this spellbinding, horrifically detailed book. She takes you inside the head of a woman who's life if forever changed and can't seek the help she desperatley needs and deserves.I would have rated this book a perfect 5, but, I hate to say it, the ending did nothing for the rest of the book. From the beginning, Jilliane went to great lenghths to give you details of the charachters surroundings and inner most thoughts. But the ended was just way too abrubt. Like no effort was given to the end of the story.But, overall, I love the book and have read it 3 times already, so yes, it is a great read!!"
1,Not good for fair playing games,"Many (over 40% so far) of the dice have quality defects. Among the defects are some sides rounded while others are flat, holes halfway through, bulges and some sides being lopsided (causing some of the faces to actually be different sizes).Since these are advertised as ""perfect for...games"" and not as 'perfect for jewelry or decoration' these defects at such a high rate is problematic. If you are looking for fair dice or even medium quality dice then keep looking.Playing with a pair of these is like playing with a deck of cards that are different sizes, folded or torn. What would you do if you bought a deck like that?"
5,Wow!,Mr. Pines Purple House and Mr. Pines Mixed up Signs were a great part of my childhood in the 60's. If they are coming out again I am ordering them now to read with my kids. Glad to se so many others have the same great memories of these terrific books!
5,mr.pine's purple house,"I am an old lady now but remember reading this book to my two son's who have now grown and have their own family's. My youngest son asked recently if I still have this book, unfortunately I gave it to a book fair. I would give anything if Mr. Kessler would reprint this book and let me buy it at a reasonable price. I have only found one on the net at they wanted 150.00 for it. I love my son but I must be reasonable. Please Mr. Kessler, re-print this lovely book so that my grandchildren and great grandchildren can hear it."
4,3 from adult point of view 5 from child's - 4 is the average,"I recently bought this book to my 5 year old son. I have to admit that I personally am a bit bored reading this book (I am bored with the routine process with all the neighbours until the final solution of painting the house purple is found) and I also do not like the illustrations ( I like more colors....) however, I have to admit that my son loves this book (I translate the book to Hebrew as I go along) and I myself like the author's introduction (""am I Mr Pine?..."") I think its quite sweet, not more then that though. So 4 stars is the average between my son and my ratings."
3,vocals too low in mix,"Wonderful performance and very moody and beautiful music. I agree this does capture the band at a magical period in their career (just prior to Steve Hackett leaving), but the probelm is Phil's vocals are so low in the mix, without a lyric sheet in front of me, I have a hard time understanding him. Also, he did not talk to the crowd much in between songs did he?"
2,Not worth it,Seconds Out is not the worst Genesis Live album but its close. Its tied with Three Sides Live as the second worst Live Genesis album. The absence of pictures of Peter Gabriel in fancy costumes and his stories is understandable but Collins sings the songs that he made famous very poorly and they are better suited for early Genesis live especially Suppers Ready (better both on the Gabriel archives and Foxtrot). On top of this only the mundane sacherine commercial ballad Afterglow is featured from Wind and Wuthering and not quality material which would have been good live like Eleventh Earl Of Mar and Wot Gorrila. Even worse though Steve Hackett plays very little on the album (possibly another reason he left the band) when it should have been a perfect conclusion to his career with the group. This is not an album thats worth collecting for any Genesis fans.
3,"Good, but not great.","Dispite some shortcomings I still found this book inspirational and helpful. Yes, in this one he does not finish the trail. I was a little disappointed to hear that he didn't actually 'thru-hike', but more or less did the second half the following year. He also did seem a bit full of himself as far as his military carreer goes, but it also shows how he is humbled by his experiences out of that arena. The one thing I liked especially was how he felt emotionally during his hike. Not many books show how mentally, in addition to physically, demanding a long distance hike can be."
4,Better than many,"I thought this book was worth reading. I do have to admit that it can be slow paced at times, it is certainly no ""Walk in the woods"". But few books give the kind of insight into the hikers mind and emotions with such honesty and clarity. if your looking for a 'cannot put it down' adventure story, this is not it. If, on the other hand, you are looking to get into the mind and journal of someone who walked the AT (see ""onward to Katahdin"" for the second half), it is a worthwhile purchase.There is an aspect to the book that others may find anoying, that is that he does go into some depth on the spiritual enlightenment he gains while hiking the AT. I, personally, would expect no less from someone journaling their journey on a thru-hike. Make up your own mind."
1,worst AT book I've read,"this is a sad excuse for a book about the AT. A retired army colonel, used to having his own way at all times tries to hike the AT and doesn't handle it very well. Much of the book is taken up with his mental ramblings in search of enlightenment, which he doesn't achieve by the time he quits at the Maryland border. It astounded me that a person could reach the age of retirement and have so little insight and maturity. There is bad poetry at the end of each chapter and a lot of whining about people who pissed him off. A bad read that made me feel embarassed for Curran. If that's what he has inside it's better hidden. Not worth the time to read and definitely not worth your money to buy, new or used! maybe if you can steal it......"
5,Wonderful pocket guide!,This is a wonderful pocket guide. What sets it apart from other similar guides is that it contains a large map in a flap at the end of the book.
2,Not impressed,"If you are going to be in London for 4 days or less and want to see the sights, this book is not for you. Focusing mainly on bars, restaurant, and shops, this book would be more useful for someone staying there for a while who had copious time to hang out and browse everywhere. The section on tourist places was short and not very informative, though the day/night map in the back saved the book from being a total loss.For a trip to London, I'd recommend getting the AAA Spiral Guide for a small city travel guide, buying a city map, and downloading Vindigo London on your Palm(tm) to get the restaurant, bar, and shop info. It worked well for my second trip out to London, especially Vindigo, which could recommend the nearest good restaurants to exactly where I was standing."
4,The best book review,"****THE BEST BOOK REVIEWKiller whales trap a herd of dolphins. They send two young dolphins to get help. They get trapped at a Sea World place and meet some friends.I liked this book because it is exciting and you don&#65533;t know what will happen next. The characters were fun, protective, and brave. I liked all them. The setting was great. It was in an ocean where colorful reefs and fish live. It was easy to read and it was good. My rating for this book is four stars."
2,Not Aretha's best,I was disappointed in this cd because it didn't have many of Aretha's really good songs & it seemed that even the good ones had vague variances from the popular versions.
4,The Rook - intriguing murder-mystery,"This interesting feature is set in a strange future. It is reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's Brazil, as it tells the story of John Abbot, a religious detective who has to investigate a young woman's murder. He discovers various codes, messages, cryptograms, and odd elements as he goes to solve this intriguing story."
1,Cleveland Deserbed BETTEr,"Probably the worst album I've heard this century. Last century it was John Denver & the Muppets Christmas album. After 36 years was the exhumation of this artifact really necessary?At it's best Miss M. proves that she could sing (occasionally). At it's worst it is shrill, crude, vulgar and musically annoying. Much awaited, much ballyhooed by other reviews, but ultimately a piece of nostalgic junk.I lived in Cleveland once upon a time, if you could call that living. (RIM SHOT and BASS THUMP) It was a dump then and it's a dump now. It's a lot like Buffalo. Buffalo is best described as Cleveland without the frills.Now in her late 60s, today's Bette is still selling out Las Vegas lounges at an astronomical ticket price. If you have the cash to blow, by all means be my guest. If I wanted to ride sometihng old and held together with duct tape I go into my garage and push my 61 Corvair around the block. I wouldn't toss Bette a dime for cabfare if she was ""working 42nd street""."
5,Tripp Lite,The Tripp Lite SMART750RM1U 750VA UPS Smart Pro Rack/Tower Line-Interactive is an excellent product and we have used it successfuly in several applications. I would highly recommend it to others without hesitation.
3,"Sex, Sex, Sex. Doesn't it get tired after a while?","I've recently read the shadow warrior series and the last legion. I've come to one conclusion. Sex get's to be a tired plot point. EVERY single book of Chris Bunch's i've read has at least one sex scene in it. Ok i'm good for a sex scene or two, but come on! Are the characters fighting their way around the galaxy or sleeping their way around it? It's no wonder humans are on so many worlds in these books, they procreate like rabbits! I give it 3 out of 5 stars. I liked the violence, the plot, and the characters, but there is just too much sex to be believable in this series."
2,"Better than any book about Diana, unless there are photos.","Bunch, even without Cole, writes a good fast-paced story with a man's man hero. Too bad that this particular story must have been written by someone else. It suffers from the everything-comes-together-all-at-once ending combined with the alien weapon that only the human can use syndrome. I will still purchase the next book that he writes but he is on probation. P.S. why did he bother to help the galaxy? He doesn't seem at all connected to any humanitarian feelings by the end of the book"
1,What a waste of time!!,"What is the point of this book? Couldn't figure out if it was trying to be a lesbian push or a bisexual push or just what. And what the heck was the ending?Is Alison Lurie a man hater? Couldn't tell that either. Polly, the main character, acts as if all men are not to be trusted. I had a wonderful father and am married to a wonderful man, so when Polly starts talking about men as if they were all alike, it makes me wary. Would I like to be lumped in with all the women who are worthless and nasty? I don't think so.Don't waste your money on this book! I finished it only because I thought there is no way a book could be this bad."
3,100 Women Who Shaped World History,"I think this book is a wonderful book to read. It shows how women changed the world history by what they accomplished and how they stand up from their troubles. At the end of the book there's a really interesting trivia quiz. On top of each page, there's a map that shows where the women lived/lives. The only flaw in this book is that the pictures are not well drawn."
2,Ugly drawings,The pictures in this book are very off putting. Yuck! If I had realized what the pictures looked like I would never have bought this book.
2,Average Writing,"Perhaps I'm being picky but shouldn't a former Secret Service agent know that a magazine for a semi-automatic pistol is not called a ""clip,"" and there's no such thing as an effective sound supressor (silencer) for a revolver? The author should know better.Aside from the amatuerish technical mistakes, the writing is average at best with stilted dialogue and unrealistic characters. There are plenty of other good thriller writers out there, seek them out and pass this book up."
1,A clarification,"Heino is one of the worst recording artists in the history of music. You have to understand that. Then, however, you can really enjoy him. I can't speak German, but the beauty of Heino is that you don't need to. He can be understood by any Indo-European speaker, perhaps even by chimpanzees."
5,Fantiastic Joseph Schmidt,"After re-discovering him I bought every CD and Movie I could find. There has never been a voice like his and probably never will be again. I adore his movies and would love to find all 6 of them . He did a lot in the short amount of time he had, being a Jew in WWII he died in 1942 at the age of 38 in a work/refugee camp in Switzeerland."
5,County Matters - Refreshing!,Country Matters - A two DVD set containing 8 short stories (50 min each) from post WWI. The stories are quite believable which is very refreshing in these days when all that matters is violence and sex. The people are all involved in real life situations (except for The Ring of Truth which should have been dropped from the collection) and the endings are also quite real - not always for the best. I only wish that I could buy all of the episodes that were made having missed them when originally broadcast. Buy this collection - you'll want to watch most of these stories again. By the way - don't expect high quality video or sound. The quality is all in the stories and the actors.
4,Great for people who like to play with big rubbery balls,"I can't recommend this enough. Perfect for those of you who like to handle big balls. I gave about four of these to the wife of an ex serviceman I was having an affair with, because she liked to fondle and handle big rubbery balls like mine, and was complaining that at home, she just had very tiny little balls to play with, like little fragile berries. So these fit the bill quite nicely in my absence. She said she likes to sprinkle cinnamon on them. Go figure. As for me, I enjoy playing with my balls in the shower. One time when I was in the shower I rubberbanded my balls and made my own rubber band balls. I enjoyed putting them on and taking them off. Oooh, that's smarts!"
3,The Last Of The Fox Chan Series,"The best in this final series from Fox are ""Charlie Chan's Murder Cruise"", ""Charlie Chan At The Wax Museum"" and ""Castle In The Desert"". Production values are high, and the mysteries are exciting and complicated.""Charlie Chan In Rio"" was supposed to be on the flip side of ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"". It wasn't. I wonder if Amazon will provide a replacement? Even though it is a remake of Sydney Tolar's ""The Black Camel"", I'd like to view it since I paid for it."
5,Great condition and quality DVD's,All of these Chan movies were in great condition and audio and visual were great. I will buy more! The typical give and take between Chan and sons and other characters were great.Craig
4,7 Chans in 1 pack,"I enjoyed all of the movies in this collection. Some of the stories reflect the coming war in Europe. I didn't like the use of double-sided DVDs for 6 of the movies or the lack of extras that the earlier collections had. Overall, the collection has great audio and video and a great addition for your Chan collection."
5,A must for any sailors library.,"Mr Connor explains everything a sailor needs to know to satisfy his/her desire to race or cruise to the best of his/her ability. He does it by also explaining the jargon that stiffles most books on the subject, making them hard to read or follow. Unless, of course, if you were born with a ""silver tiller"" in your hand."
3,Wasnt what i expected,"Bought 2 of this puppys, for my surprise they were really small, i think they are for kids or for fishing REALLY small fish. they look in good shape very firm and tough although for my fishing purposes(15 lbs) i think they dont work at all. im saving it for my kids."
3,Good JavaScript introduction,"It describes appropriately the JavaScript language. It is well written with almost no typos. It also has some introduction to the new JavaScript version 2.0. However, it is not clear when it describes DOM, JavaScript, and browser objects, methods and attributes, what it is fundamental for web applications development."
4,A Classic You Should Not Miss,"This is a classic. Even though it is a bit dated, it conveys all the basics with grace and insight. Better than any of the other half dozen books I have read on JavaScript, it is intuitive and clear. Kudos to Scott!! I wish he had written (would write) more: he has a gift."
5,Burnin' Sky,"this album is by far the best that Bad Company put out. The first three albums had to be the best because these albums were the ones that put Bad Company on the map. The combination of these four guys are truly spiritual and to even see them today is by far the utmost in blues and rock,they are the corner stones of rock and blues today."
2,Not even Manolete can save this one!,"I love the three great actors in it, but this movie is awful, its cast notwithstanding! The plot's premise is absurd to begin with, its developement too confusing and the final outcome completly preposterous! Thank God both Abril and Banderas show some flesh, so the audience -male and female- won't feel this movie was a total waste of time! Goes to show even the best cinema in the world today -Spain's- has its flops!"
3,Nice book for not-so-light summer reading,"I couldn't wait to read this book, and I was not disappointed. Beran is a lively writer who has fun with words; I laughed out loud at his sardonic phrases like ""Sinister Capitalist"" and his asides (the one about Edie Sedgwick was a hoot). Beran opines, and reading the book is rather like being the listener in a one-sided (yet enjoyable) argument about public policy and American culture. Even so, Beran substantiates his facts with endnotes; we as readers know when Beran stops reporting and starts postulating. That's fair.One criticism is the editing. I did like Beran's writing style, but the work could have benefitted from an editor with a firm hand. Beran's arguments meander. Occasionally-only very occasionally, though-his spry use of language becomes burdensome rather than engaging for the reader."
3,Ho Hum...,"I tried. I REALLY tried. However, I just couldn't get into this book. Sandy and Jenny slowly fall in love and have great college sex. Sandy is ready and willing to accept herself as a lesbian. However, Jenny refuses to come out to anyone but Sandy. When they are older and meet again, Jenny feels differently, but Sandy is scared of being hurt again. The book is verbose and the story drags. The print is small and the sentences are long. Although the premise of the story is good, I would not recommend this book to any of my friends."
4,Russian Ark,"This is a lovely video. A bit odd, because it is done in one single take with a high def camera. However my Foreign Film club enjoyed it."
3,Good but could have been better,"The movie was very good in that it was shot as a single take. The actual places that they showed in the movie would not have been my choice. I was more interested in things like the private apartments that the imperial family would have used. Alexander II was brought back to the Winter Palace (a part of the Hermitage) and died there. I also thought that it lasted longer than 90 minutes. You need to know a little history or you will be confused. It's well worth it for the scenery and the authentic costumes that were worn, down to the servants liveries."
5,I bought as a gift...,I bought as a gift as its my fathers favorite movie ever! He loved receiving it and has always been a favorite of his. great seller as well...movie came very quickly!
2,"There's a time and place for this movie, this wasn't it.","I'm usually far more fair and descriptive when writing a review of a film, but I took 3 honest tries at this one and the best words I can describe it are an artsy, plotless Russian sleeping pill. Certainly the attempt at doing an entire film in one shot is admirable and presenting Russian art and history are worthy, but the guides through this stunt are absolutely coma inducing. Their voices are beyond subdued and unenthusiastic, oft-times the interaction between them and others appearing in new scenes disjointed and full of non-sequiturs. To be fair to the reader of this review, if you are prepared for this type of effect and presentation, you may come away with more than I was able to, but I certainly recommend a healthy dose of caffeine, an early evening viewing and preparation for art for art's sake."
1,Bad Movie in Good Costumes,"The costumes were great.Everything else was horrible: plotless, uninformative, idiodic dialouge.I kept having the feeling that the effort it took to make this picture could not possibly have been wasted on such a flat and pointless script. One could learn more about Russian history by spending half an hour with an encyclopedia.Please watch 'Moscow Doesn't Beleive in Tears', 'War and Peace', 'Freeze, Die and Come to Life', 'Battleship Potemkin"", or anything other than this rubbish."
3,good,"i like this cd, well most of it. the lil wayne song ""shorty bounce"" is probably the hottest track on the cd. for the guy who says chamillonare is the best...he must have forgot about wayne. lil wayne tears it up on this track along with every other song. i would like to see some lyrics for this track though."
3,Decent Soundtrack,"The soundtrack to the guartneed summer blockbuster The Longest Yard was a big surpise considering I only like some of the artists on the CD. The CD opens with the lead single Errtime by Nelly which has been slept on in the clubs and raido, but I actually like it and I've never been a Nelly fan. Lil Wayne and T.I. both continue to shine on the tracks Shorty Bounce and Bounce Like This. While Ali and Murphy Lee come into their own with a little downsouth flavor on Stomp and Let Em Fight. After the first five tracks the soundtrack loses steam for about FIVE tracks with weak songs by Akon, David Banner ,WC and Taylor Meade. Trillville picks it up with their song Infiltrate but D12 gives us a standard jokey rap track called My Ballz. The last song called Fly Away is clearly a dedication to Nelly's late sister and is well executed. All in all this is a decent soundtrack, and like most soundtrack it has strong and weak moments."
1,sucks,"this sucks . i enjoyed the movie and all the music in it made me think it would be an awsome soundtrack . NONE OF THE MUSIC FROM THE MOVIE IS IN THE SOUNDTRACK . NONE OF THE GOOD OLE SOUTHERN ROCK THAT THEY PLAY EVEN GETS MENTIONED. i bought it , played it and circular filed it . its in a landfill somewhere by now."
1,a review by a master haha,(...) weres the CCR and all the good music from the movie?! This is crap. why wouldn't they at least put acdc on there when there song was played during the comercial? makes no sence at all
5,This CD iz off the hoook!! lol,"I absolutely looooove this CD. The cd has this vibe that you get as soon as you listen to the first track. its beautiful. i put the whole cd on my ipod and listen to it every day. words cant even begin to describe. my favorite song on the Cd is Fly Away. i recommend this CD to all those who dont have it, its worth it. :)"
2,Poor Soundtrack,"This sound track isn't nearly a soundtrack as much as it is a compilation of hip hop and rap songs. It might as well be the next 'WOW! Hiphop' CD. Not to mention I went over some of the soundclip previews on Amazon and it's amazing how many curse words rappers can put into a 30 second timespan. One of them even talk about ""putting his d**k into anything"", because that is totally related to the movie *saracasm*. There were alot of other good songs that were not hiphop in the movie that didn't make the list. There was some Lynyrd Skynyrd in there, the music from the drunk chase scene and when Crewe first came onto the field for the game. They could have thrown in some good misc. rock songs just like they did with half of these rap songs that weren't even in the movie either. Since the movie was both a black/white comedy, they should have aimed the music genres towards black and white audiences."
2,Unexpected,"I honestly expected something else when my mom brought home this soundtrack. The remake of the original 1974 movie was amazing and the music used in the movie was great. When my mother brought the soundtrack home instead of the classic rock used in the movie, it was all rap. Now I enjoy rap and the tracks layed down on the album are very good, but I don't think the CD should have been all rap, too many good AC/DC songs were used in the actual movie."
2,"""Inspired By"" abuse","Soundtracks are a big part of selling the movie. The words ""Inspired By"" came into play when a movie didn't have enough songs in it to complete an entire soundtrack. With this movie ""Inspired By"" is just a tool to push lesser acts. Only five of the songs on this soundtrack actually appear in the movie. With the amount of awesome songs that were in the movie you'd think there would be a soundtrack to match. The two songs that I most wanted to hear from the movie were Nelly's ""Boom"" and Union Turnpike's ""Oh"". Guess I won't now. I guess you could also argue that licensing and royalties come into play too, but being that Nelly produced the soundtrack and put most of the people in his ""stable"" on the soundtrack I doubt it."
3,Rehash of jumping around sections of better Firm workouts,"There is no new material in this video--it's a compilation of sections--and not the best sections-- from other Firm workouts. It does provide a solid cardio workout, but little strength training. This workout could certainly hold its own compared to aerobics videos from other studios, but it's definitely not The Firm's best."
3,"A ""Best of"" version of other Firm tapes","Although this workout is one of the toughest in my collection, it is definitely not my favorite. The segments from Firm Volumes 4 and 6 are the most interesting and challenging. The segments from Volumes 1-3 are extremely dated (we're talking early 80's here)and feature the same old boring aerobic steps we've all done a thousand times before. And the outfits are a flashback to the past! I'd recommend skipping this video and selecting Volumes 4 or 6 for a better, less dated workout."
1,Wrong size? Ripoff!,"Make sure you have the correct size because they'll charge you $5.11 for shipping and $1.88 for ""restocking"" to return it. Net to you $0. There are different sizes and they don't make it all that clear in the description - so they can make double on you when you return the wrong size. It would have fit in a #10 env. and could have been sent for less than $1.00 but Customer service said I had to use their RMA label...Shame on you Amazon for ripping off your customers! I should have just kept it and ordered the right size somewhere else."
4,It's Great,"I read other not so good reviews of this, and I think these people can't be real Soupy fans. This DVD set is a laugh riot from start to finish. Go for it. You'll love it."
3,disappointing,After buying this DVD and viewing it I was very disappointed about the production. There was an indication from reading all the production notes that there were hours and hours of material to use. I found that this DVD was very limited in material and what is with all the commercials. I didn't like commercials then and I don't like them now. While Soupy was brilliant the people who put this DVD together do not seem to be very professional. You can't miss with Soupy but this was a very short DVD that could have contained much more content. please do a better job next time and lose the commercials.
5,A Breath of Fresh Air,"This book came into my life at such a critical time. I have three young children (ages 5, 4, and 1) and I have been looking for resources on gentle parenting techniques. There are so many useful, practical, and gentle methods outlined that I feel like I'm walking away with a brand new set of parenting skills. This book brings hope and peace to my parenting. So many thanks to the authors for this work!"
3,"Decent set, but others are better and cheaper","I bought this set and returned it to amazon.com (with no problems whatsoever, I might add) after discovering that the lid organizer does not hold all the lids (perhaps I'm a little too organized for my own good, but I knew that would drive me nuts to have a couple unorganized lids!) Plus I found a Rubbermaid set with lids that snap together or to the bottom of the containers for much cheaper (I think I bought it at Sam's Club or Costco, but they offer it on amazon.com too) and am really happy with it. I'm single so I don't need a lot of big containers, but the smaller and medium sized are perfect for my leftovers and lunches for work. The colorful Farberware set was nice, but there simply are comparable products for cheaper from other brands."
5,IGGY!,"This is a GREAT ALBUM!! The music of the 80s pretty much Sucked! This album is from 1981, just the begining of the 80s when the ""new wave"" movement was in full force. Filled with horns and an upbeat tempo, some may consider this commercial music. I bought this album on vinyl when it was released. Trust me there was not a radio station I heard broadcasting this. He was poking fun at ""new wave"". This is one of Iggy's best albums. The lyrics are hilarious! If you want punk anger turn to ""Raw Power"", it's a great CD. If you want to have a lighter but still rocking good time then buy this Cd, It's definately one of his best! It was was the perfect anti commercial new wave album. It poked fun at ""punk's"" ugly stepchild ""new wave"", some people didn't and still don't get it."
4,Good guide for discernment and spiritual direction,"I enjoyed this book but was not overwhelmed by the depth of insight in it. I was looking for a book to assist me with spiritual discernment and a friend of mine recommended it, particularly the chapter on discernment.Overall it's a nice systematic approach to opening one up to spiritual direction. The beginning is more like a textbook discussion on where people are on their spiritual journey and the marks of how the different stages of the journey manifest themselves.The practical element is mostly a description of the author's experience with discernment and is not much different from other outcome evaluation techniques you might read about in non-spiritual works.If you are interested in discernment or in self-guided spiritual direction, you will probably gain something from the book, I think I just came into it with higher expectations that, had they been met, would have warrented a higher rating."
5,This Is Not An NTSC Release!,"This is an excellent collection of rare and little-seen video clips by The Moody Blues in thier best, early years. I ordered one from a Marketplace Seller here expecting it to play in my USA dvd player. No dice. This is a PAL format region 0 dvd encoded for dvd players in Europe.Fortunately, I just happen to own a region-free dvd player as well, so no worries. If I didn't, I'd be out of luck. I did some research on this elusive dvd title and found out that only Holland was able to release this collection of videos, some kind of ""rights"" issue. Holland DID NOT make any NTSC copies for export to the USA or any other non-PAL format countries. Period. Evidently the Moodies finally squashed this release, because it swiftly went out of print. Make no mistake - this is destined to become quite a collector's item in years to come since I'm sure not that many were made before it was deleted.Just make sure you can play non-USA dvds on your dvd player or computer before you buy."
1,Mediocre Monologues,"Barely literate grammar and sloppy copy editing match this book's thin content. The book ignores masters of the genre, presents formulae for doing what everybody's doing. Some of the interviews contain useful hints, but nothing to justify purchasing or reading the book. Shame on the publisher!"
4,NSYNC Rocks!,"""It's gonna be me"" is my favorite song off No Strings Attached, and I'm so glad that they decided to make it the next single. It's a great upbeat song and I can't wait to go see them again! :)"
5,wow,this cd single is great. it has one of the best 'n sync songs. It's gonna be me is a great mix of 'n sync and a little bit of a funky edge. I think you should all buy this cd.
5,Simply the Best,This single has it all...the great hit It's Gonna Be Me...a remix of another great Bye Bye Bye...a terrific bonus track This is Where the Party's at...and a surprise...an instrumental version of It's Gonna Be Me..great for learning the song and singing for your friends...
5,Its another great hit from our fav band,"Ah, our beautiful boys have made It's Gonna Be Me their new single. Now, we all loved it the first time we heard it on the cd, and the single is even better becuase it has remix's on it! So, I say to all the *N SYNC lovers out their, buy this single and ALL the other singles and cd's! (and most all of them you can buy at Amazon.com)! ~Stay *N SYNC and reach for Les Etoiles!"
1,it's gonna be me,this is so like Bye Bye Bye which I did not care for.I think they could do better and have. I don't think that the album is up to much and this is a perfect example. Ithink that they would do better if they stopped trying to be BSB and tried to be N'Sync I loved tearin up my heart and they should go back to this and start again
1,Don't waste your money.,"This dvd consists of approximately 22 minutes of documentary, and the ""exclusive"" funeral material is only of cars and many people outside the church, with one brief shot of the hearse. The list of 17 songs on the back has nothing to do with what's inside except for a few songs that he sings in an old concert. This appears to be very hastily put together and, in my opinion, a waste of money."
2,Guitar Hero Controller,"This guitar doesn't work with Guitar Hero 2!!! You will need an adapter if you plan on using it for GH2, and even with the adapter it doesn't work on occasion."
5,Live Versions of Some of the Best,"Great Live versions of some of the TD best! This CD would be a great introduction to Tangerine Dream's music. If you know someone who has never heard their music and would like to get them familiar with it, this CD would be a great place to start."
3,20 x loop,They did not state the size or how large was the product. It turned out to be smaller than my other similar products. It was not the size I expected.Ed
1,YOU MUST ALL BE JOKING..,"I can't believe the great reviews this album received, stating that it's ""great rock"", ""great hard rock"", whatever. oooh!! Gimme me a break !! This band ( at least in this CD) sounds not like rock at all, it's more inclined towards country music !! And the lyrics ...! God !! They are awful, totally cheesy, always talking about love, girls, heartbreaks, and on and on... Sad !! Of course there is great quality in the musicians, but to say this is a landmark in rock... it's a lie."
1,plays when it wants,This is a great album the problem is it only plays if and when it wants to. How do I fix this?
3,Disappointing Fan Life,"I received this pair of items as a gift. It was shiny and new, still in the box.I used the fan daily (almost continuously) for two months. At that point, it was dying. I could sometimes get the fan to work by spin-starting the propeller. A week later, no joy. Just flat out dead. I suspect they never designed it for continuous use, but that is what I bought it for: The flexibile cord and USB power allowed me to position it just over my desktop keyboard and below my line of sight keeping me cool and refreshed.I've since replaced it with a small A/C fan that sits off to the side of my desk--but it's not nearly as effective."
3,"Buy the fan, don't buy the light","The fan works great, it's quiet and efficient. The light, however, is worthless, it barely shines enough light to tell its working. Another consideration is how tightly the male USB jacks fit in your female receivers on the computer--the weight can make it hard to position if you dont have a tight connection."
2,A classic example of mediocrity,"This looks like your grandpa's awl, so it has to be good, right? Wrong. Sure, it has a wood handle and a nice feel, but right where it counts - the point at the end of the steel shaft - the softness of the steel become apparent. I've had mine for years but I've had to literally re-straighten out the point using pliers. It re-bends easy enough and gets sort-of true, but every time I use this thing I think why didn't I just by a better one? A construction nail is harder than this."
4,My favorite Bad Co album!,"Ah, it's the summer of '79 all over again and Paul Rodgers is at his best. My favorite song? Early in the Morning. Loving the memories!"
2,disappointed,"My cannon died the day before my daughters birthday so I ran out and tried a bunch of cameras in the morning and bought one. Although this camera is 6 mp, my 3.0 Cannon took much clearer pictures. I have had this camera for 9 months and I am sending it in for the second time for repair. First the power button stopped working, and then on Easter (something about holidays) all of the functions of the buttons switched. When I pushed delete, the menu came up. Even the mode selector wasn't working. It was reviewing the pictures in all three modes. I will say that sony support online is very helpful, but I need something more reliable. I am done with this camera."
2,Twice Bitten . . .,"I purchased this camera for taking snapshots of my nephew at the park, children's museum, just about everywhere, and after just one outing I was very satisfied with the quality of the pictures and the ease of use in a variety of settings. At this price, I would have given it five stars, except that the next time I went to use the camera, it wouldn't power on fully -- it would turn on, hiccup, and die with the lens partially extended. Returned it to Amazon with their amazingly easy return process, but replacement was also defective . . . I'm pretty determined and I'm also stuck with a 1 GB memory stick, so I'll be trying this camera again. It would be perfect, if only it worked!Update: Third time's a charm!"
2,Typical Problems,My daughters camera seems to be experiencing the same problem as others. She bought it at 14 years old with her own $ to take on a school field trip to Washington. She took about 50 shots and then the power button would only work randomly or the lense would freeze coming out or closing. Being an electrical engineer I would guess that the motor for the cover/lens draws so much current that the battery voltage drops so low that the camera shuts off. I have tried brand new Eveready Copper tops with no luck. If I try it 4 or 5 times and can't coax it to life I can sometimes set it to view the pictures and then slide it over to the take picture mode and it will stay on. I feel bad as I talked her into a $300 Sony telling her to buy a good brand name and it would last for years. Tough lesson for a 14 year old spending babysitting money!
1,Unreliable,"My DSC-s600 is only one day old and had 15 pictures in it,that's the end of the story.Camera turned off automatically and the shutter remains open.It spoiled my vacation.I strongly recommend not to go for it.Technically it is very badly designed."
1,This camera stinks,Half of my pictures are out of focus making it useless. Should have sent it back.
4,Great camera for the price..,"I still cannot believe a 6M camera at $200.00! I've been using Sony cameras for some time and this was an upgrade from my older 4M. Similar features, but I recall I bought my old one at $400.00! Expect to get nice large prints (>16X20) from this 6M if you're into printing posters or large photographs. (If you don't care about larger prints, a 4M is plenty!)I didn't give it 5 stars for 3 reasons:1. The camera is a bit heavier than others in the 6M range (non-SLR of course). Nonetheless, comfortably fits in your pocket.2. It may prove challenging for some with larger hands as the size is smaller than others.3. No rechareable batteries included.. Plan on buying some. Keep regular ones for emergencies only!Highly recommend a 512M memory stick (or two 256Ms). I would also turn off the digital zoom.A bientot.P.S... don't expect WiFi for $200.00 price!"
1,very disappointing!,"NOT a good tape; the songs are super cheesy, and are also the same songs on her 'disco' tape; ... Usually she has good tapes, but not this time!"
4,to the point,"A very streamlined rock album,you know their story so I won't get into that.The band would soon improve on their formula.The title track is their statement of purpose. I guess this would be ""outdated"" these days.Too bad."
3,"Run, don't walk...","If you like Bad Company (in particular if you like Mick Ralphs), go buy some early Mott The Hoople. Of course, he's more polished here, but don't you want the original version of Ready For Love? It also seuges (sp?) into another Ralphs composition, the instrumental After Lights."
1,Really terrible book,"About half way through I almost put this book down. I slogged through almost to the end. But when two more innocent people were murdered, for no reason (it didn't advance the plot at all)I finally gave up. That was about 20 pages before the end of the book. I really wish I had stopped half way through. Actually, I wish I had never picked up the book in the first place.What didn't like about the book? 1) the heroine was not at all likable or someone you could relate to, 2) the hero was non-existent and 3) there were three murders of innocent people that were in no way necessary for the plot.Don't waste your money or time on this book."
1,Misleading - Let the Buyer Beware,"I purchased this to go with my Toshiba TV/DVD player. It does not work. I called customer service to ask about this and was told that there is a disclaimer in ""big, bold letters"" stating this remote will only work with Toshiba TVs and not with any combo units. I felt extremely foolish for missing this critical bit of information until I returned to this site to see just how I could have made such a mistake. I DON'T SEE ANYTHING TELLING ME THIS REMOTE WILL NOT WORK ON COMBO-UNITS! In fact, the selling point states clearly that it will work with any Toshiba made after 1988, and this was the only reason I bought it. So I give it 1 star. Will it work on the Toshiba TV-only sets? I don't know. But I feel like I was tricked into buying this, and now I have to return it."
1,Not in advertised condition. (Not even close),"This book was listed in ""Like New"" condition by the seller. I would say it is in ""Poor"" condition. The cover is worn. The binding is cracked. Pages are yellowing and separating from the binding. I will have to thumb through to ensure no pages are missing before reading it. I purchased this as a gift for my wife, and unfortunately I stored it without opening the package in time to return it."
5,MaxSteel 16' Tap measure,"This tap is a very good fit in the hand tap. I droped it off a 40 foot roof once, it cracked the housing but it still worked."
5,comic book styled movie,"Possible spoilersIts a very basic story.. girl comes to Japan, boyfriend leaves her and she is heart broken. Something draws her to a Ramen shop and she decides to learn how to make it. Her teacher speaks no English and wants no student but begrudgingly accepts her in time. The American in turn finds a calling, which she lacked before. The story spans a year.. this is where the makers kind of failed.. I had no idea so much time passed until they just told you outright. And the girl was still not speaking Japanese or even bothered to learn much.. very disappointing.If this had been an anime.. it would have ROCKED! But as a movie, well they shoudl have made the passing of time more evident.Anyway I enjoyed the movie and the Japanese actors where VERY good, especially the Sheff. Will watch again!"
1,I'd rather eat ramen than try to stomach this stinker,"What an awful movie. The story was awful. The acting was awful. For such a great actress like Murphy who starred in 8 Mile, Don't Say A Word and Sin City, to do this movie she must have been kidnapped and held at gun point or was flat out desperate. I would even go as far as to say this movie could have ruined her legacy.... but lucky for her no one watched it.Here's something funny about this film.... they spent $32 million making it. The same budget as Source Code starring Jake Gyllenhaal, which was a box office blockbuster and went on to make $147 million.. Just goes to show a movie about time travel in an alternate timeline >>>>>>> cooking ramen.RIP Murphy, so sorry you were involved in this stinker just before your untimely death."
4,Timeless Classic,"Most modern music can be categorized into specific eras, such as the 50s or 90s, but some music stands out as timeless as it always sounds fresh and new. Two tracks on this cd, the title track 'Monkey Island' with its strange narrative and changing rhythms, and 'Surrender' with its funky latin beat, fall into this second category, making this cd a worthwhile addition to a good eclectic collection of modern music"
4,strap in and hold on,"This one doesnt quite reach the blow out boogie of ""Bloodshot"" or ""Full House"",but what stands out here is the quality of the songwriting.The best ever.Still,""Surrender""""Somebody""and ""So Good""righteously rock!!I think this is their best studio effort by far."
1,The Incarnating Child,"Although the book is absolutely brilliant- the production was appalling. The quality of the printing and the photographs in the book were at times unreadable. I would definitely not recommend buying the latest edition of this book. The edition dated 1987 is, however, perfect - fortunately I was able to get a 2nd hand copy."
5,From Myth to Mysticism,"Father Louis Bouyer has written a detailed yet clear account of the Christian experience underlying the entire faith, the union of the person with the Holy Trinity. Partly an anthropological study on the nature of the cultic practices of early societies and mostly a treatise on the way in which Christianity built upon the ""good dreams"" that pervaded humanity leading up to the Incarnation, Bouyer sympathetically reviews in particular Hellenistic paganism by focusing upon Eleusis, Mother Goddesses, Dionysius, Orphism, and Mithras. He then reviews the Jewish Wisdom tradition and, for the next 200 pages, devotes himself entirely to the Christian experience in its New Testament and sub apostolic expressions. He also includes insightful chapters on the later tradition including modern psychological understandings of mysticism. This is a very insightful and useful book for both the novice and the expert. Be sure to look at the sample pages as they give you the best review! Enjoy!"
1,I hate it,"I hate it, and I am the biggest Yes freak there is alive. I have given 5 stars to nearly every album they've ever put out, but this simply is not Yes, not without Jon.Sorry, but I purchased it, and I had to take it back to the store, I couldn't stand it."
3,Satisfying compromises,"3 1/2Quite solid, possibly maligned mid-career release at the turn of the 80's was a noteworthy effort to pump new blood into stalling creativity but cannot hold the palpable virtuosic synergy present prior, even if it admirably tries."
4,Drama a Hidden Gem!,"This album is a far different cry than 1978's Tormato. Rick Wakeman and Jon Anderson left the band...replacing them were former Buggles' front man Trevor Horn and keyboardist Geoff Downes. The album has a harder edge than previous albums, demonstrated in songs like Machine Messiah and Tempus Fugit. Trevor Horn, sounding a bit of a cross between Jon Anderson and future member Trevor Rabin, does surprising well on the album(during the tour, criticisms though flared). Geoff Downes, although not as flashy as Wakeman, shows for the time that he was a very good replacement, at the least, shining on songs like Does It Really Happen. Remaining members Chris Squire, Steve Howe, and Alan White give the album a very driving sound. Some incredible guitar and bass on this album. Although this album doesn't necessarily have the Yes sound of old, it definitely is a hidden gem in their collection, and one of my favorites by the band."
2,Yes - 'Drama' (Elektra/WEA),"Originally released in 1980,as many long time Yes fans may consider this effort to be an insult to their intelligence.However,'Drama' really isn't all that bad.It's so-so.I mean when you replace keyboardist Rick Wakeman with Geoffrey Downs and frontman/vocalist Jon Anderson with Trevor Horn,you're bound to draw some negative responses there.Overall,I would consider 'Drama' to be second class art-rock.In addition to the lp's original six cuts,this reissue tags on ten(is this right?)bonus tracks,of mostly cutting room floor material.Tunes here that I thought 'sort of' makes this CD somewhat of a keeper were the ten-minute ""Machine Messiah"",""Does It Really Happen?"" and the uptempo ""Tempus Fugit"".Pretty much aimed for Yes fanatics only."
3,Pretty good.,"Drama is a pretty good album from Yes. This isn't one that I listen to much, but it's not bad. All six tracks are listenable and respectable. Geoff Downes and Trevor Horn do a good job throughout, along with the other guys. Trevor Horn's vocals aren't disappointing. The keyboard playing from Geoff Downes is really good, too. The album's musicianship is tight. The songwriting and production are also satisfying. My favorite songs are ""Tempus Fugit,"" ""Into the Lens,"" and ""Does It Really Happen?"" Chris Squire lays down some cool bass guitar on ""Tempus Fugit."" That's an energetic song that has cool vocals. The keyboard and bass guitar playing on ""Does It Really Happen?"" is impressive, also. Drama is worth a listen."
2,Buggles Join Yes,"Of all the things that make up the Yes sound, the sprawling epics, the heavy keyboards and the like, the most distinctive element is the voice of lead singer Jon Anderson. His high-pitched, chirpy sound perfectly brought to life the trippy, pixish lyrics he wrote. For 1980's Drama he was replaced by Buggles lead singer Trevor Horn. In fact the other member of the Buggles, keyboardist Geoff Downes joined as well. While the highlight of the album is the superb keyboard work from Mr. Downes, its determent is Mr. Horn's vocals. All too often he tries to mimic Mr. Anderson and he comes off as a bad imitation. There only a couple of good songs and they are the industrial sounding ""Into The Lens"" and the unwielding ""Machine Messiah"
1,Roy is amazing but the mastering is as bad as it gets!,"How could anyone do such a poor job on the mastering with todays technology?! . Roy Buchanan's great album ""A Street Called Straight""The album is great, the playing is great, but it is so muddy, and the volume so low that it doesn't even represent 1980's cd technology well...never mind 2003!!! Beware. Hold off on buying if you can and wait for someone to do it right!Sorry to seem negative but it is true."
2,Shouldn't a CARS game be about racing?,"I purchased this game for my CARS-obsessed 3-year-old son. However, I am very disappointed in it. Instead of being a racing game, it is a game that requires the player to solve ""puzzles"" and perform certain tasks. The only racing aspect of the game that we have been able to unlock is where Lightning McQueen races Chick Hicks (very boring when it is done over and over) and although this entertains my son the first 3-4 times, he becomes very bored with it. The other tasks on the game are okay but get quite boring too. However, we have since purchased CARS Mater-National and HE LOVES IT! Needless to say, this one hasn't been touched since we purchased Mater-National."
2,Difficult for the younger kids,"While the movie appeals strongly to children under 8 years, this game is definitely too challenging for that same age group. My two boys are adept on Mario games and the Lego games but are just frustrated with this game. If you are looking for a racing game for a child under 8 years try Mario Karts."
1,Worst movie-tie-in game ever!!,"I collect DS games. My son loves them and on his own he now possesses over 60 titles. Also, he loves movies, specially Pixar and Dreamworks movies. So, I have been trying to get him some games that are based on a Pixar classic or similar, such as Cars (very bad), Wall-e (boring), Toy Story 3 (excellent), Ratatouile (very good), and so on. There about 20 DS games (besides the ones I already mentioned): Cars race-o-rama (very good), Cars Mater National (very good), The incredibles (good), Up (lacking), Ratatouile Food Frenzy (boring), and so on. Cars is at the very best bottom: very little racing, very hard/boring puzzles (for my 6 year old kid and to me) and very little charm. I'll give it a 3 out of 10 (because of a very little racing game). If you are looking for fun, you have more luck slamming your head with the car door than by playing this game. Period."
4,CARS game fun for ages 4+,This game is fun and easy for 4+ yuears old. My childred love it. It is easy to learn and allows them lots of fun time playing it.
1,still havent received item after 6 weeks,I'm really annoyed as i am yet to receive this product. it is supposedly stopped in custums. What good is that to me????????
3,"A for performance, B for song choice, C for ego","There is no doubt she is a consummate performer. But where were the songs the Boss, Touch me in the Morning, and Remember me? So many great songs she did not perform, instead we get the cheesy Maniac, (her and the dancer, hard to watch) Beat it (not her song), So Close, Muscles, and Lets go up. What is with the backup singers stuck down below behind a barrier? Granted, maybe there was not enough room on the stage for all the musicians, but to stick the backup singers out of sight like that. She commanded the stage anyway, no need to hide everyone else and to hardly acknowledge them. She has a huge gay following but you would never have known it by the audience shots. I have to wonder if they were edited out. I began to feel that some of the energy from the previous night had faded. On a positive note the sound and picture quality are great, and she never looked and sounded so good."
5,Oh my childhood I love thee so!,With all honesty I bought this set for two of the four additions and honestly they were the only things worth anything but are fully worth the price of admission. Those items are the commercials and the Meet the California Raisins special. I watched that show so many times as a kid and it introduced me to the oldies and claymation. I just heard that my sister still has the VHS and now shows it to her kids who also love it. The second claymation short is harmless but not very interesting and the cartoon looks terrible but as I said the Meet the Raisins is the reason to buy this and everything else is simple dressing.
4,splendid musicianship as expected from this talented bunch,"""going for the one"" is rich with energy and the creative element that is signature yes. personally, yes is one of my peripheral music choices, simply because i was born after they made their mark. but in these times where talent in the rock genre is at an all-time low it is important as appreciators of good music to turn our attentions back to the roots, and yes is one of those bands who makes this possible. i encourage everyone to sample this album--i bought it for the title track, because i think it is one of the most intricately written and tightest of yes's ""short songs,"" and of course, wondrous stories, speaks for itself. but the entire album stands on the creative merits forged by the members of yes."
1,[...Bad] Connector,"This product is junk, due to a cheap connector that broke the first time I tried to remove it form my Visor Pro. The keyboard wouldn't work at all when first installed, then worked intermittently with much adjusting of the position of the keyboard after the connector was cracked. A really disappointing dud."
4,12 foot Decimal Scale Tape Rule,"The 12 foot tape rule works fine and is accurate for both outside and inside measurements. It uses 0.02"" markings for the first foot then 0.1"" thereafter. Wish it kept the 0.02"" marking for the entire 12 foot. I use it in woodworking where it is easy to read and alows you to find the centers of objects quickly."
5,amazing,I bought this exhaust because my old one rusted off i didnt have any clamps or 3 inch pipeing so i welded it on straight to the caddie. I decided to just straight piped it to the back sounds great has a great rumble and ive gotten alot of thumbs up for having it on a v6 ranger. I would recomend this.
4,"Okay DVD, Nothing to write home about","I can't say paying retail price for this DVD was worth every dollar for me, however you can squeak out some knowledge from it. The DVD did have a lot of theatrics in it which was not a good thing; however with careful eyes and ears, you can pull out some useful information.Now depending on your role and expertise (Song Writer, Sound Engineer, Mixer, Musician, etc...) will depend on your love for this DVD. My cup of soup is musician and I like recording and mixing as a tool for my song creation. This DVD did provide me with a few tips that I can apply to my mixes and recording session.If you're a music gear nut and love to live & breath anything music related (like I), then you're going to own this DVD very shortly if you haven't already."
1,Only buy this if you love Charles Dye as Much as he loves himself...,"Wow. This is truly bad. I can only imagine how stoned this guy was on his own ego to conceive of shooting footage of himself all over the world blathering on and on. It's a horribly-shot shaky video homage to this geek with money to spend on himself. Oh yeah, and he talks about mixing occasionally, too.In other words, there may be good info in this, but it's so badly done and with so much fluff that you are far better off spending your money elsewhere. Like the Universal Audio mixing DVDs, where they actually talk about mixing instead of themselves."
1,Buggy,"My nephew was really looking forward to getting the game for his ninth birthday. He played it for an hour or so and had a lot of fun with it before the game locked up and had to be reset so he could continue.Unfortunately, this trend continued and the game continued to freeze every half-hour or so, and in different places under different circumstances. We returned it, thinking perhaps the disc was defective, but the replacement was exactly the same.While the game was relatively easy and he enjoyed playing as the familiar movie characters, the presence of multiple bugs made playing it an exercise in frustration. It is not an item either of us would recommend purchasing."
4,Cars the movie fans will love this game!,"If you are a Cars fan, like me and my son, you will enjoy this game. It's a little challenging for my 6 year old. Probably better suited for atleast 7 yrs. and up. Very realistic Cars characters, voices and all."
1,A total waste of money,"I think the person who wrote the first raving review worked for pixar or something because this game was a HORRIBLE buy. I bought this yesterday and my four and six year old have already lost interest even though they love video games and loved the movie. Its just a very very boring game a three year old might like it but I doubt it. We had 3 other boys over yesterday for a play date and all of them got bored with it within a fifteen minute time span. Dont waste your money if your kid is really begging for it, rent it for a weekend, I bet after that you wont hear anymore requests. Since I opened mine its going on ebay tomorrow."
3,Very good charatcer development but concept turns silly,"I found the development of the main character and the incremental changes in his personality facinating. The plot, however, becomes down right silly as we learn that the bad guys want the gene to make their soldiers more bloodthirsty and heartless. The simple question here is, why would ANYONE think such extreme measures were necessary. Did Hitler need genetic engineering to persuade the SS to do his bidding. Did Stalin or Idi Amin? History is a record of man's inhumanity to man, and man's heart has never been known to suffer from a shortage of evil.James BeauSeigneur"
1,Major Disappointment,"Extremely simplistic development of character and plot. The technical/chemical detail involved in genetic research was so overwhelming it seemed to be a disguise for the shortcomings mentioned above. I am a fan of the Left Behind series, a genre new to me, so this is my first, and last, Bill Myers book. Given the premise this could have been a fascinating book, but was instead extremely disappointing."
4,vagaries of dealing with human subjects,"The book is full of handy tips about how to conduct social work research. The biggest characteristic, or the hardest aspect, is that your subjects are human, as opposed to non-human animals. The vagaries of dealing with multiple instances of the human condition, and especially if some subjects have problems to begin with, are something to get experience in.There is a very short coverage of statistics. But since the entire book is short, this was unavoidable. The maths is elementary, and you'll probably need another more thorough text on it, if you're amassing serious amounts of numerical data."
4,Takes me back...,"I remember playing with this toy when I was a kid, probably 20 years ago. It's awesome to see it's still being made. I received the product in fine condition, and the toy works exactly as it should. I've already gotten a lot of enjoyment from it by competing on time vs my friends who also remember it from their childhood. All around great toy, fun for all ages."
5,Excellent,"I rank this in my top 4 rock operas in hard rock. If you like ""Streets"" or ""Dead winter Dead"" by Savatage, or Trans-siberian orchestra, this is for you. Excellent vocals by Glenn Hughes and Joe Lynn Turner and the guitar work is impressive. If you like rock and classical mixed into one, go pick this album up."
3,"Same old, same old","You always know what you will get with a Judith Krantz novel ... beautiful women, sexually charged teenagers, token lesbians, relationships where the woman gives up almost all for her man and who, of course, wouldn't love her anymore if he knew her deep dark secret ... and of course, a child named Daisy. Does Judith Krantz think the name Daisy is a good name? Also, it sends a message that it's better to die beautiful than to go to steps to possibly prolong life (and lose your hair) if you have cancer. While reading this book, I could have sworn I had read the same lines before in one of her earlier books. This book is junk food and candy -- quickly read, not too filling and just as soon forgotten."
5,Africa at its best,"Such an unexpected great story of a 2 families who moved from England to Africa. The 2 sons, one from each family found some unexpected problems that most children would have died. The historical truths educated me on the Zulu wars and the reasons. Back to the the two sons, these young men were so well self educated in survival and the dangers they experienced and methods used to find a way out makes a great story. I was never bored and skipping paragraphs. A great read."
2,Not Good,This stain works ok for cheeks but not good on lips. It dried my lips out really bad. It also left a stain line on my bottom lip where all of the stain had gathered.
1,Poor Sound quality,sound quality is poor. saving numbers to the phone is also not simple.Over all improvements are required
1,Rusted within a few months,Waste of money. Was rusty and chipped within a few months. Guess I got my iron intake for the year!
4,Top quality blues rock from a highly underrated player,"Dave Hole is Australian and unfortunately not well known, which is a pity because he is one of the best blues and slide guitar players in the world.All of his albums are good, and this one is no exception.If you ever have a chance to see him, and I believe that he is on tour in the Europe and the States in July / Sept, you will not be disappointed. Great player, great show."
3,Finally Ran Out of Steam,"Mr. Hole's first two efforts, ""Short Fuse Blues"" and ""Working Overtime,"" just blew me away with his monstrous electric slide playing. I didn't think he could possibly top them, but he did with his next two efforts, ""Steel on Steel"" and ""Ticket to Chicago."" But ""Under the Spell"" lacks the fire, intensity and quality songwriting of these previous efforts, and especially is missing the outstanding acoustic numbers that peppered ""Steel"" and ""Chicago."" I'm a huge Dave Hole fan, but I ended up Ebay-ing this one. Not an awful album, just not up to par with his previous four. Not the place to start if you want the definitive Dave Hole."
1,"Love Bryan Ferry, Hate this CD","Wow, I really enjoy Bryan Ferry, but I found this collection of music to be grating and sloppy...dull ideas...Others are encouraged to apply...it is interesting to discuss our differences"
5,its your choice.......,"PEACE? OR ANNIHILATION? yeeeeee-haaaa!!! this album is faaaantastic. as far as the music goes crucifix sounds like discharge on speed. and the singer sounds like the guy from VOID and Darby Crash, he sings real fast and its totally sloppy and bitchin.the lyrics are anarcho/peacepunk along the lines of icons of filth and discharge, you get the point. they are on southern records which is fabulous, but they are from San Francisco not the UK or anything.the pictures of them in the booklet are great, they look like they are reaaaaally having alot of fun, i wish i couldve seen these guys live, that would have been insane. buy this now and kick out the jams. if you like this you should here this great band from texas called the assault oh boy are they great and that lead singer is just a dreamboat."
5,Classic Story Rock,This is a must have album as a Genesis fan.From beginning to end you have great lyrics and music.Enjoy!
3,Duke brings Genesis' progressive era to an end.,"Duke is the last Genesis album with any resemblance to the progressive era of the previous decade ('70s). The first four or five songs segue nicely, forming an interesting song suite, culminating in the gorgeous, keyboard-drenched Heathaze. Unfortunately, the ""commercial"" Genesis that would soon rear it's ugly head makes its first appearance on Duke - with lame cuts like Turn It On Again, Misunderstanding and several sappy Phil Collins ballads. The album ends with a bang on the instrumental Duke's End, but the writing was on the wall - the Genesis we once knew, loved and respected would soon cease to exist."
5,Simple & delicious recipes.,I've had this book for a couple of years. All of the recipes are easy to make. I've shared many of my recipes with friends who also loved them. A friend from work borrowed mine and just had to go out and buy her own copy. Great book!
5,Wonderful Read,"This was a terrific read. I randomly picked it up right before my local library closed one evening. This is the first time in a very long time that I wished the book went on--I wanted to keep on reading it and I was sorry when I finished it.I love how it ties the land to the people, how each of the women characters are drawn to the sea and connected to the land. Its so nice to have an uncomplicated storyline that shows people who gather their strength from God. This is the kind of story that connects to Christians and encourages them in their walk. Its the kind of story I would like to write"
2,Self-delusion,"I'll cut to the chase. Self-delusion is the title I chose for this review, because anyone who read this and pretended it was a profound eye-opening experience that revealed hard to grapple with truths about the contradictions in traditional theisms will need a ph.d in self-delusion. Albee, disappointingly proves that he has quite an aptitude for self-delusion if he believes as he seems to that this is a competent and wothwhile work. I sincerely believe that my rating of two stars was kind and was a benevolent gesture towards a playwright I have much respect for. Everyone is self-indulgent at times and so in a very Christian manner (Note the irony, uh oh is this indicator too cerebral and tedious? Guess it's because I just got through reading Tiny Alice.) I forgive the otherwise impeccable and inimitable Edward Albee."
2,doesn't lock,"I bought this tape measure for my husband for Christmas. It was a very good price for a name brand, quality (I thought) product.It doesn't lock into place. Yes it's a tape measure but the powerlock doesn't!VERY Sorry I bought this."
4,It is huge,"This tape measurer is fine, has a heavy duty feel and is a good value. The lock is a little stiff to operate but works. I was expecting it to be small, but this thing is rather bulky (about 1.5"" X 3.5"" X 3"") and would not easily fit in a pocket. The dimensions given are for the packaging so it is hard to tell."
3,Still a better effort than their first release,"For those people who, like me, grew up listening to the radio in the early 70's; The Sutherland Brother's and Quiver had one killer song that seperated them from all the rest. (I don't want to love you but) You got me anyway, is always going to be the type of song that will define the great sound that was unique to SB&Q. Sadly though, this reissue being an Import does'nt contain that song! While it is certainly a huge step compaired to their first release; the US version contained the hit that this import does'nt list.Great songs like ""Real Love"", ""Lady Like You"", ""Where Do We Go Wrong"", and ""Sailing"" still make this CD a Keeper. But do yourself a favor; get ""Dream Kid"", ""Beat Of The Streat"", ""Slipstream"" and all of the other SB&Q releases. And if you're lucky enough to hear(I Don't Want To Love You But) You got Me Anyway; you""ll experience what made 70's music like this so magical!"
3,Gets darker with age,"First, let me state that I have dark brown hair that requires bleaching for the manic panic to show. After the bleaching, red passion came out very bright, more like a fuchsia. I picked this red because it is all that my local store had. At first, I really didn't care for the color, but after a week, it started to darken and the color became stronger. I really started to like it then, and will use Red Passion again.Also, unlike others who have used Manic Panic, I did not have a lot of run or staining onto my towel or shower. In addition, my stylist seemed pretty pleased with Manic Panic as she did not end up full of stain on her fingers or towels. I've tried Special Effects and a couple of other brands only available via stylist channels (sorry don't remember the brands) and those other brands bled color way more than manic panic."
3,Harmless Fun,"Having recently received the Cars Videogame I can say that its a fun translation of the big screen action. There is an arcade mode where you can race for the Piston Cup as Lightning McQueen of Darrel Cartrip. Its a nice little cartoon racer. One of the cool features is that as you make your way through the pack, you can see the places of the next several cars ahead of you. The numbers float above the cars as you would see on the Nascar coverage.There is also the story mode. Taking a page from the GTA world you are set loose in the open ended world of Radiator Springs where you must accomplish various tasks. All of the landmarks from the movie are on hand as are the voices from the film.Cars, the Videogame is nothing revolutionary. It borders on the 'almost too easy', then again... its likely be marketed to the kids who want all of the other Cars goodies. If you are a Pixar fan or are looking for a family-friendly GTA experience, then by all means, check out Cars for the PS2."
4,"Seems good overall, but not what I needed","I wanted a book specifically addressing the issues of ""age-related atrophy"" vs early dementia. This was not specialized in this area so I returned the book."
5,Unique and moving even twenty five years later,"After reading ""professional"" critiques of YES for as long as YES have been producing records, the above ""paid for"" analysis comes as no surprise. Forget all that, this album is pure and impeccably performed; it is sincere and it has struck a deep chord in many people around the world. And there is certainly something terribly wrong with that, eh rock critic??"
5,Close to but not Relayer,"I think this is Yes' second best album and shows the growth of their song arranging capabilities in a new light from their previous work. Their album ""Relayer"" is in my opinion the penultimate ""tour de force"" in the Classical Rock genre; however, this album is a prerequisite course for anyone's ""Music Listening"" education. Chris squire is at his peak, not only making his rickenbacker 4003 the albums heartbeat, but also in his vocal performances. Anderson's vocals soar and are of course of the timber and tone to do this music with perfection."
1,"Yes, I Don't Get","I never did understand this band. It seems like they are constantly overdoing the complex nature of their music, but I just could never figure out what the point was. I realize that they are good (if not great) muscians, but they seem to try to make up for lack of real creativity with tons of disjointed oddities. The lyrics are at times almost sermons, but nothing is said. ""I get down, but I get up, I get down but I get up"" etc. etc. I have listened to these guys off and on throughout the years hoping to get it, but they never changed and neither has my opinion. Who wants to listen to a church organ? Emerson, Lake, and Palmer. King Crimson. All the same. Jumpy, irritating mishmash of whacked out tangents. Confusing and weird for the sake of weirdness. They can play their instruments, but they just need someone to calm them down and write a few good tunes for them. Oh yes, and can the castrato vocals."
5,This Cd Rocks!,"Reviewer: robert j salo (see more about me) from Rancho San JacintoEstaes , CA- United States:Close to the edge is my favorite song and hey ""i get up i get down"" hey did did you freak out yet? i hope you did! Its not as wordy as many of the other songs are for their length, but the instrumental parts are good anyway. Tales from topographic oceans, now that is wordy at least the first song is, but i like it anyway, and thats beside the point."
5,Good Food,"This is essential to any eclectic/prog collections, but, most importantly, YES is a band that stands OUT and continues to do so...if it doesn't grab you, take you over and leave you starving for more, then, you cannot be human. ;-) Some people understand YES, some don't. If nothing else,YES does tend to stay away from glorifying negativity.Positive band, positive energy=electricity and best of all for THIS CD:Food for very deep thought.No matter how ""old"" this CD may be, always remember: Bach is older...and STILL marketable!!!No Two Snowflakes,ari"
3,The beginning of a very good writer....,"I happen to be a ""true-blue"" Deveraux fan. This book probably in it's day was excellent. It reminds me of the ""Judith Michael"" books or perhaps ""Janet Dailey"" the sweeping novels of the 80's. She describes a fictional place in New Mexico to a ""T"". What I did not like about this book was.... as someone mentioned the way it ended. There were some loose ends that were tied up but done so in the last 4 pages which gave me a ""let-down"" feeling. The characters were engaging but some things that happened in the book just didn't make much sense so I'm glad I have it to add to my collection but I would really like to caution someone if you are just purchasing it to add to your collection hold off and wait to get it at a reasonable price. Because in my opinion the story is not worth the price that I have seen on auctions."
1,"Very confusing, disappointing","I've always used Princton Review for my test prep, but this was all they had at the bookstore, so it's what I purchased.Besides being extremely confusingmethods and formulas that they tell you to use on one page, if you try to apply them to a problem on the next page it won't work.And though I'm only on page 60 of it so far, I've already found four mistakes in the answers for it's section reviews.I would never ever suggest this review guide to anyone, and am very sorry I deviated from my usual brand."
4,Moderate coverage.,"I used real sand color (I'm Nude in LM tinted moisturizer) and wanted to love it. The quality is great, very fine powder, but it gives sheer to moderate coverage which wasn't enough for me-I had to layer too way much product to have similar effect like with other mineral make up (BE, jane Iredale, Lancome etc).I also like dispenser, spill free, great for travel.I also think that LM use too much package for the product, make it smaller (container is the biggest I saw in mineral foundations), without the box, and lower the price."
3,"May not be ""Dishwasher Safe""","I would've given this mug 5 stars a couple of days ago. I love the design and the size. It's a nice, big mug. But, it says it's dishwasher safe so I put it in the dishwasher. The first time it did ok, but the second time it came out with several long cracks in the glaze on the inside of the mug. I've ordered another one which I will hand wash only. As I said, it's a really nice mug... just hand wash it to be on the safe side."
1,Total piece of trash!,"This is with out a doubt the worst item I have ever purchased!! Cheaply made and designed. Once it's folded and the sock is placed over it. It's just about impossible to get your toe's/foot into the opening to pull the thing over your foot! I tried to do it a few time. I'm going in for hip replacement surgery and could not imagine using this piece of garbag after surgery when I can't use it now. What a waste of time. So mad, I just tossed it in the trash!! Looks like I will be going sockless until I can find an assit device that works."
5,A few facts about AWB,"Firstly AWB is not the first Average White Band album, that was ""Show Your Hand"" (1973 MCA Records) now I think, sadly, deleted. If you can get hold of a copy BUY IT. AWB also contains the last recordings of original drummer Robbie McIntosh and is worth purchasing for that alone. This is a great album, reflecting the early, more raw, less ""produced"" sounds of a great band."
4,Movie,Love the movie I've wanted to purchase it for quite some time. And now I can add it to my collection.
1,Three of six have broken with little use,"I am surprised that a Stanley Product would be made so cheaply.The black locking lever on the bottom has a very weak hinge point, and breaks with very little use.I have thrown away (recycled) four of these so far. I used the last one (brand new) for less than two weeks.I think I am going to start buying my products from local stores.Returns on Amazon are next to impossible, and a waste of time!"
5,These things are getting hard to find,"Been looking for these, Amazon had them. I want a tape that stays out until I want it to retract, this is it. I use a tape every day on the job, all the others are too fat and bulky."
1,very poor design,"I would give this less than one star if I could. The water has to be on full blast in order to keep the faucet from turning off due to it's weight. Now that I have spent money having it put in, and more money having it adjusted, to no avail, I will have to spend again to replace it. I am very displeased with this product and will not be tempted to purchase another Price Pfister faucet."
2,Ehhh,"I am an avid 'birder' and thought that the cast would make this movie fantastic, but I was not impressed. It does have its funny moments but I would not watch it again."
2,No!,"Why did I listen to the other reviewers here?! Seriously, what do you expect from a movie about a bird siting competition?! If you buy this, you must be a dodo. I'm sure feeling like one!"
2,wasn't a funny at all,the trailer suggested it was going to be really funny but i laughed more on the trailer then the actual movie was not impressed
4,Better Than The Past Few,"This series had been getting rather annoying, with Faith becoming more and more unbearable. This one had far too many characters to keep straight, many of whom really weren't necessary, but they managed to make Faith more tolerable.The murderer's identity was fairly easy to figure out, and there were parts where the book became muddled -- particularly when a chapter just jumped into something major, completely out of left field. But the family dynamic made it more interesting than the past few books, in which Faith just looks down her nose at everything.The one thing I didn't understand was the relationship between Faith and Betsy -- I'd never had a hint in previous books that there was any problems between them, and suddenly they're at each others' throats as a plot device. That should've been tightened up in the previous books leading up to this one."
4,Modern Polish Country Village Comedy,Modern country Polish version of Green Acres meets Ma and Pa Kettle - This is not your typical Polish country village - light comedy - entertaining
4,Jack sounds great- The band sounds great!,This might be Jack's best big band album his voice is in good shape and has that Jack personality. The song choices are really nice and the arrangements (most if not all by Tom Kubis) are really well done and played fantastically.
3,I laughed out loud,"This was a fun and quick read. The story was a bit wacky and had a few too many stereotypes. The author makes fun of just about everybody and everything. I was a little disappointed that the women all seemed to be either loose, weak or stupid. But,it was still kinda funny and it would be fun to analyze for a book club."
1,Review Harry Belafonte's interview,As a fan of Harry Belafonte I bought this DVD thinking that it was a performance but it was a one hour interview. Interesting as it was (HB spoke very open about his background and career) but no singing and I have to look for another DVD by HB.
1,Not as described,The item description said it had a metal die cast case. What I received was a plastic crome coated case. I am a big fan of the old original die cast metal because they were almost indistructable and I would not have ordered this item if they had correctly described it! I feel like I've been misled.
3,Gripping with a caveat,Vengence is a gripping description of Israeli counter intelligence with the emphasis on vengence. My only qualification is the accuracy of the narrative. It is extremely difficult to penetrate accurately what Israeli counter intelligence is up to.
3,Not very believable,"I read this book many years ago and repurchased after watching the movie Munich. I feel this is another fictionalized account based on some true events. The point to be made by this book is legitimate: hate breeds hate, killing breeds killing, terror breeds terror. Another lesson to be heededis that world powers must be more fair minded to all other nations. We can no longer afford to ignore hundreds of millions of our fellow world citizens. We all must be open, to listen, to show some sense of willinness to work together. If not WE are all doomed."
1,Don&#65533;t Spend Money on these 24-bit remasterings!,"The 24-bit remastering of the ABBA CD's is a HUGE letdown. The older CD's (the one's that came out originally) have a much brighter sound, but plenty full. They remind me of the original album sound. But the new discs sound too muddy or dark and the high end (which includes things like acoustic guitars and cymbals) are rather flat or dead sounding. Like my fellow reviewer from San Diego said, ""save your money"". Keep your old discs. They simply sound better in a side by side comparison. The box set sound quality is better than these 24-bit remastered discs."
5,Nice shoes.,I take EEE size shoes and these are tight on me. I did not returned them because I lost the paper work on them. But as far as the shoe goes it is a very nice looking shoe. I could not find fault in them. If it fits buy them. They are really nice looking for a dressy casual look.
3,Sachs SG204006 is better for a 2003 GMC ENVOY XL,"I have a 2003 Envoy XL and I wanted the rear hatch to open (much) higher than the OEM parts did because as I am 6'4"" tall and was tired of having to duck down to get into the rear of the car.After weeks of research I purchased Stabilus (or Sachs, same thing) Model #SG204006 lift supports. I had to initially almost force them on (due to their length), but they fit great and I now have a 6'6"" clearance and no longer must duck down to get in the rear hatch. They snapped on perfectly with no modifications needed."
3,had to return first,"I loved this lamp in the picture, so I was very disappointed to receive it and find rust on the base and the embroidery dangling and badly sewn. I asked for a replacement, which I promptly got, however, only was reimbursed $9.23 for shipping and it cost me $32.23. Therefore I believe I WAY overpaid for this lamp. I do enjoy it, its very ""Burtonesque"" but basically I paid $120.00 when in all actuality, thats what 2 should cost. Enjoy the lamp, but NOT HAPPY ABOUT COST AND HASSEL."
2,this product is so bad,"I shouldn't have expected much for the price, however, I would like to give the advice to others that are interested.. don't waste your dollars on this one! Spend a few more bucks to get better quality. The saying is true to this item, you get what you pay for!"
5,Stanley Tape,"The perfect tape measure for my job. I use a tape dozens of times a day and I'm very happy with this purchase. The overall quality is extremely high and the tape rolls in and out of the housing with ease. The lock works perfectly and I know this thing can take some falls and still function just fine.As for the actual measurements and markings....they are great too! Easy to read yellow surface is marked down to sixteenths on the English side and millimeters on the metric side, with handy red markings for feet and every 100 millimeters. Not obstructed with pointless markings and needless writing.For the professional who works with standard and metric and for the homeowner needing a tape for the toolbox, this is perfect. Buy with confidence."
1,Over hyped trash,"How this band got any acclaim is beyond me, maybe it was all the drugs where people like today were to stupid/stoned to actually hear the garbage being played to them. This is terrible."
3,Not too bad.,"I have this item connected to the marine stereo(CDX-F50M)on my boat. Even though the box said it was not compatible with my particular Sony stereo I tried connecting it anyway and what do you know......IT WORKED!!I do have to admit, it is a little slow when it comes to scrolling through the albums and playlists but I like it because it keeps my ipod away from the outdoor elements.It was very reasonably priced too. Less than 8 bucks!!"
2,"Buggy, oh so buggy","This is my second iPod interface for a head unit in my Escape. The first one was JVC and I replaced it with the Sony because I wanted Bluetooth. The Sony head unit is easier to use, but the iPod interface is sadly lacking. It does not allow the basic search functions JVC did. It also crashes the iPod regularly. I used to leave my iPod in the glove box for months without touching it. Now I pull it out to reset it almost every day."
2,I've seen all DEAF people!,"And they all love this album!What do you get when you put together a bunch of guys with good technical music background, no talent as composers and a vague common interest on world peace, oriental wisdom and saving the whales?You get exactly this, The Yes Album. If you add overinflated egos after a few years of succesful albums, what you get is Topographic Oceans. But by the time they did The Yes Album they were relatively unknown -and that is what saves the thing to a certain point."
4,Great yes album,"This is the best studio yes album out there I think. It is all classic Yes material. My favorite songs on it are Perpetual Change, and Your's is no Disgrace, but The rest of the songs are also very good too. Ive seen all good people is a big radio hit and Starship trooper and clap are frequently played at Yes concerts. The reason why I am giving this review 4 stars instead of five is because although Tony Kaye's organ sounds good on Yes's first album and Time and A Word, it just does not fit the proggressive rock sound. Instead of getting this album I would get Yessongs since it has most of the songs from The Yes album but has Rick Wakemen on Keyboards instead of Tony Kaye."
4,"First Yes ""classic"" album","If you haven't heard ever old Yes albums, this is the right album to start with. Album is easily accesible, not so progressive like Close to the edge. However Yes Album has just one great song (Starship trooper), two good songs (Yours is no disgrace and I've seen all good people) and rest is mediocre stuff. This may sound harsh (especially compared to endless praise elswere in this pages) but I have heard all Yes classics and this is not their best album, far from it. But defenetively must one to hear and start your Yes prog adventure."
4,Very usefull if you need metric,This rule is made with the usual high quality that I have learned to expect from Stanley. It's case is identical to their 30 ft power lock rule. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I would have found it easier to use if they had left off the English units and put the metric scale on both sides of the rule.
4,Love It,A great collection of smooth jazz greats. It scratches that smooth jazz itch anytime you need it.
5,No Depression when Bette's around!,"Who doesn't love The Divine Miss M? Bette's early work is wonderful. I wore out the grooves on my LP of this album. How nice to have Bette's work on CD. This one is difficult to find... if you do find it do not hesitate to buy it immediately!Bette played Mama Rose in the television adaptation of Broadway's greatest musical, ""Gypsy""... Please take a look at my new book about Gypsy Rose Lee, also known as The Divine Miss L and The First Lady of Burlesque.Lady of Burlesque: The Career of Gypsy Rose Lee"
2,Johnny English re-packed,"I just finished watching this.I hate say it, but something went wrong here?No where as funny as the first .Johnny English Reborn is kinda a failed satire .As much as I like Rowan, Aka, Mr Bean.They story is trying to be edgey... with character that far from it.Things were too fast paced in this. All characters seemed rather dull.There was too much editing in this movie. proof is having about 20 mintues ofdeleted scenes that were more funny than movie.Director wanted edgey, faster, movie. Well he got it.The result is just 2 stars rating.I think this the final Johnny English."
2,UNTALENTED MUSICIANS,"I picked up an advance promo. 1. Mister New Year's Day 2. Pilgrim's Progress 3. One Becomes Two 4. Jaywalkers of the World 5. A Hard Year 6. The World on a Shoestring 7. To All My Friends 8. Arms to Hold Me 9. Empire State 10. Mortimer' Ghost 11. StayThe strength of Josh is his unique topics and views. However, similar to Madonna, he likes to fuse trite sayings into his lyrics and then calls himself an ""artist."" Like so many alternative bands, the lead singer can't sing and the band can't play their instruments. Frequently his lyrics are drummed out, and rather badly, as the band lacks an arranger. If you enjoy the bulk of the no talent alternative folk-style music that has been made so successful by a generation that loathes talent, by all means pick it up."
4,Interesting with a capital I,This book was not so much a love story as a character study. The cultural information and historical information was fascinating. I couldn't put it down. The ending was a bit abrubt and contrived but this was an excellent read.
4,Still funny but starting to fade,Season 5 is still funny to me but kind of weird at the same time. I feel like the show kind of started to get weird. A lot of it is funny but it kind of felt all over the place at the same time. Like Sophie having a baby with some random guy. The episodes just seem very random and really have nothing to do with each other. But because some parts are really funny I still watch them.
1,Don't Buy This Juicer!!!,"Bought the O2 directly from Omega -- that was the first mistake. Almost 3 weeks later the O2 arrived after virtually harassing them into shipping it. First time to use the juicer: apple, carrot, ginger juice, nothing robust. The O2 kept shutting off. Some kind of internal breaker was tripping. Second time juicing, same thing. Can't seem to make more than half a glass of juice at a time before the thing shuts off. Great juice...if you can get it.I've had another Omega juicer which was a work horse. VERY, VERY disappointed with the O2 and Omega's service. Now I am absolutely dreading going through the return process with Omega. If you're buying Omega, I definitely encourage you to spend the extra money. The O2 is not where it's at."
5,Great for my dog,This is a wonderful de-matter. i have a cockapoo and she gets matted quick often. This works wonders. Its exactly like the one my groomer uses.
1,run out of steam,"The original concept wasn't bad, but the writers just don't seem to be creative enough to produce good plot lines based on the ""math whiz"" idea. Rob Murrow was the wrong person to cast for FBI role and his single dimension talent is really showing.Judd Hirsh was good at first but now is just an annoying aging Hippy."
5,Love it!,I had this watch for five years before it started to die! I loved it so much that I bought it again. The face is really small. The band is really a dark magenta. It is almost a plum color. I like it but changing the bands is pretty easy as well. Everyone compliments me on this watch!
4,Great everyday watch,"I had this same watch for about 3 yrs when it stopped working. It would have costed more to fix the 1st one than to replace it with a new one so that's what I did. Even if this one only lasts 3 or 4 yrs it works well for me. Its easy to read and very nice looking. I love the fact that it can light up with the push of a button. It's only con is that it doesn't ""take a licking and keep on ticking "" ."
2,Not Worth It,"Despite their having a decent appearance and set of specifications, I'm returning these binoculars. The principle reason is that they are mechanically substandard. The focus wheel, which is quite stiff anyway, has several mm's of free play before engaging to begin changing focus. In addition, it was not clear that the diopter functioned properly to alter the focus in the applicable barrel. Because of these problems, I did not use the binoculars in the field, or, indeed, for more than a few minutes testing. However, my impression was that the barrels were not perfectly aligned, a fault that would lead to eyestrain with extended use. Bushnell knows how to make good binoculars. It's disappointing that these are not."
2,"Not bad, no practice paper included","This is an OK book to give you the basics of origami however it did not include the practice paper that was noted in the description. Also, it notes that there are 100 images of different origami however it only shows you how to make 25 of them and the rest is instructions on basic folds along with images of shapes you can make (no instructions). They don't even give you instructions to make a crane! I think you're better off YouTubing, I found it a little less confusing and obviously straight forward."
3,Simple Projects,"The cover in this book, when you order it, is different, and the models in the photo are not included in the book either. The projects are all for beginners. It has very good illustrations of the different folds and easy to follow instructions."
5,eye opener,"Packed with detail and concrete evidence. This is an expose of the Florida elections and how they were fixed before the ""chad"" stuff even began. Jim Crow is alive and well under the hand of the Bush family. Wake up call of the first order. Also a powerful description of the disasterous results of privatization of utilities: ie Enron etc... Connected to the Bush family as well. Clinton doesn't escape Palast's critiques either. Aggressive and passionate."
4,Good view of the Globalization Greedsters,"Palast gives many examples of how the ravages of globalization affect industries and whole countries. He provides true stories that are both long and short to support his assertion that ""democracies"" are being destroyed by corporate greed. He further shows how government not only looks the other way, but also has insiders at the very top who profit by it. Some of his longer stories tended to be a tedious read. But then, Palast is a reporter that is careful about facts and timelines. I wish his TV program could be seen in the US. My only complaint about Palast and others like him is: Where was he in the eight years of Clinton? Maybe he wasn't writing books. The phenomenom that there is often an unholy coalition between corporate pirates and people in high places in government is nothing new."
3,Very nice but they wear out very fast,"I play volleyball a lot. Typically a pair of Vincere sand socks gets a hole in them within a few weeks, which might be 75 games or so. Once you get a hole in them, then they fill with sand easily and little lumps form under your feet which are uncomfortable. But I guess that's about 35 cents per game of protection. Maybe it's worth it. Your mileage may vary, I'd like to hear others' experiences in terms of durability. Don't know why nobody makes a san sock that really holds up to the strain. I know sand is abrasive, but it's not that -- it's the seams split open from lateral movement."
5,Effective,"Keeps the cold sand out in the winter, and keeps the scalding hot sand off in the summer. I only wish I had bought these socks about 10 seasons ago."
4,Purple Planet,"This game is loads of fun for kids 3-7. They really learn how to follow directions. It also dosen't hurt that it's Dora and Boots, what kid dosen't love Dora?"
2,Boring,"My four year old received this game for Christmas. It is very repetitive and has little or no educational value. Probably the only good thing about it is he is learning how to use controller. I think the Leapster is the best bet for video games for kids. However I am thinking about getting him the Frogger Hop, Skip and Jump game and mat. Lets hope that's not a waste of money too!!!"
5,A Journey That's Worth Repeating,"Our 4-year old daughter loves this game. I wish there were more like it for the ""early childhood"" category. She is able to play it by herself and says she likes it because ""no one dies in Dora and you get to explore every planet everywhere"". It's a well done game with nice graphics (though I think Dora looks like those Bobblehead collectibles) and a happy atmosphere. It's a teaching game that builds skills and confidence and lets kids disappear into this fun world with bubbles and bouncing and fun kid-stuff. Plus, what kid of any age wouldn't like to fly a spaceship and collect treasure?"
1,"Doesn't Play on PS2, just my PS3","This game only plays on my PS3 even though it is a PS2 Game!!! I tired contacting seller and they won't respond. I suggest statying away from seller (Coleman Biblio)and game!!!! I own two other Dora games that work great!! Better grapihcs game play, and they work on my PS2!!! Bad BUY!!!!!"
1,disc error!,Well I bought the game fr my 4 year old daughter and it won't play says disc error! Any comment on resolving this issue? please help!
1,Disc error,"My son got this game for christmas, he was very exicited until we couldn't play it because of a disc error; I do have the ps2 ;also it makes a very loud disturbing noise every time i put the disc in the playstation."
2,Constantly repetitive,"Ok, this used to be a great show but it's now getting repetitive. Raymond is still spoilt, Robert constantly gets jealous of his brother, Marie constantly gets involved, Frank is the same rude self, and Debra constantly nags Raymond. So what's new in this series? Absolutely nothing. It's as repetitive as I've used the word 'constantly' in this review. Pretty annoying."
4,Legion Fan,I have read comic books for years. The item was exactly how they represented it and it was shipped in a satisfactory time frame.
3,Good but disappointing,"It's a very good performance, although the Pirate King seems to think he's Captain Jack Sparrow.....My real complaint is that it's only Dolby Pro Logic (2 channel) and 720P! I have a 1080P 67"" set and I can tell the difference with this. Plus, the miking was frequently off.They should have/could have done better."
1,Wrong One,"Wrong one. Still waiting on the Kevin Kline, Angela Lansbury, Linda Ronstadt, and George Rose version. My only copy is on LD. Guess I'll have to burn my own DVD as MCA seems reluctant to issue it on BluRay or DVD. Too bad."
5,Great CD! Top Notch Music! Buy it Now!,"If you want good listening music, turn to Brian Culbertson,for the ultimate in Smooths, and Grooves. His newest is NOEXCEPTION! My favorites would be:""1: Just another Day""""2: Get it On""""4: I could get used to This""""5: Without your Love""""8: Together Tonight""""9: All about You""""10: I wanna Know""..."
2,A Little Too Slow,"Here's yet another smooooth jazz album, although this one has some interesting things. Herb Alpert's trumpet is a nice fit on ""Just Another Day"", and Culbertson does some nice playing here and there. But for the most part there is too much of the same feel, with little spontaneity. This will probably do well with the wine-and-cheese crowd."
5,Nice and Smooth!,"Brian Culbertson gets better with each new project. This takes smooth jazz to the next level. He starts off kind of funky with the track titled, ""Get It On."" There is something for everybody's taste represented here. I like the song with Trey Lorenz, ""Nice and Slow"", ""Someone"" featuring Kenny Lattimore on lead vocals and ""I Wanna Know."" My favorite though is a beautiful piece with an interlude called ""Together Tonight."" It is so passionate and expressive that I can almost hear words even though it is a completely instrumental song. It hasn't left my cd changer since I bought it almost three weeks ago. The cd itself is dedicated to his wife. There's 'something bout love' that makes for the sweetest inspiration. It's definitely worth a listen!"
3,The Murder Mystery Video Flop,"I ordered the VHS because my daughter wanted to have a murder mystery party. I also ordered various other murder mystery items, willing to try anything. This video was satisfactory, although not quite as good as i had hoped. Over all, it was easy to follow and i would recommend it to a first-time party host/hostess."
3,Not really what I wanted but still useful.,I was really after a Right angle engineers (Draftsmans) triangle made of Metal with both imperial and metric markings on to use on a flat surface. This was the nearest thing to what I was after that I could find. However the picture made it difficult to see that there was a lip to use along an edge. My purpose is so I can draw and cut papers and cards for bookbinding.
5,MASTER STORY TELLER OF A BYGONE ERA,"KENNETH ANDERSON 'S TALES ARE MASTERPIECES OF STORYTELLING!

3,"Mostly Early 1970s Tracks, Plus 2 Live Recordings.","In the 1970s progressive/art rock took of, especially in the UK.The Moody Blues, Genesis, Barclay James Harvest, Jethro Tull, to name only a few.Yes were certainly a leading light having been formed in the late 1960s.The CD provides 65 minutes of their work, most are songs of 9 to 10 minutes long.Although this has been remastered, I found some songs a little rough around the edges.Having said that Wonderous Stories really is lovely with soaring vocals from Jon Anderson and inspired keyboards from Rick Wakeman.For me the cream here is And You And I, Alan White (drums), Chris Squire, (bass), Steve Howe (acoustic guitar), Rick Wakeman, (keyboards) and Jon Anderson (vocals) just seem to come together as one for a 10 minute masterpiece, maybe the best they've ever recorded.The live recordings, Roundabout and I/ve Seen All Good People, are not the band at their best, I think Yes were at their best in the studio."
5,This book can give you hope if you work with gang members,"As someone who has worked with gang members for a number of years, this book really resonated with me. It is so hard to communicate to people who gang members are behind the facades they wear. Arturo Hernandez's real life experiences speak powerfully to both the hopelessness and the hope to be found in America's inner-city areas. He also provides insights as to the underlying problems which have created our gang problems today, and hypothesizes about possible solutions, many of which seem viable based on my personal experiences. This book is a must-read, particularly for those in education-related fields dealing with gangs."
5,"Dictionary of Literary Biography, Vol 76 Review","These series of books can be use to find biographical information about a wide varity of authors. This particular book is good for finding information on Afro-American writers between 1940-1955. The resources found in the book include the author's writings, photos, and illustrations etc..."
4,Last Hurrah From 3 Legends.,"Now this is more like the CSN of old! Except for a few forced attempts at some kind of commercial chart success (yuck), this disc is one of their best. Crosby is at his best with ""Delta"" and ""Might As Well Have A Good Time"", while Stills writes some of his best in years with ""You Are Alive"" and ""Daylight Again"". I'm usually hard on the Nash written tunes but these aren't too bad. A definite for CSN fans."
4,More Like Stills and Nash in Concert,"CSN came to the Los Angeles in 1983 in support of their Daylight Again album. The concer featured selections from their first 15 years of touring. Playing a powerhouse set that included material from the Woodstock years to Daylight Again this should have been a defining moment for the band. It was a great show for Stephen Stills and Graham Nash. David Crosby was catatonic throughout the show fighting his own personal demons rather than performing as a member of the band. Stills carried the show with his intense guitar playing and Nash's singing while not perfect was adequate for the occassion.This is a stripped down disc that features no extras. The highlights include: Suite Judy Blue Eyes, Wooden Ships, Southern Cross, For What its Worth, Long Time Gone and Teach Your Children."
2,"Sounds good,hard to watch","Firstly the sound quilty,harmony and music is excellent in this DVD. The problem I have is in the veiwing.Crosby is stoned out of his head, like a deer caught in the head lights. Vacant steers, a drug coma on his feet. No energy in his performance. Even worse than a middle aged drugged musician is a middle aged musician who thinks he's twenty years old. Graham Nash looks like your father dancing at a party, its disturbing. Combine this with bad 80s fashion and it becomes embarrassing. Stills is alright, dressed fine. Put this DVD on and switch off the vision."
1,schnit stills & nash,This album qualifies as one of the biggest scams in rock-Crosby wasn't even on the album. Most of the vocals he would have done were supplied by one of the most talented and under-rated singers in the business-Mr. Timothy B. Schmit who did tons of studio work with little recognition when the Eagles were on hiatus.Do yourself a favour and buy Timothy's album *Feed the Fire* instead of this farce.
5,Great Concert,"To my mind this is a far better concert than their later Acoustic set from 1991. Stills and Nash are in fine form , Crosby plays a minimal part due to his ""blissed out"" state , but he's not really missed . The backing Band are excellent and add a solid punch to the songs they play on .The vocals and harmonies from Nash and Stills are wonderful and far truer to the original songs than the later Acoustic set and it is this aspect of the concert which truly makes it great. Five stars for me, I loved it."
5,Billy Kicks Butt,"Beale Street is full of great blues players. You can see them inside and outside. My favorite club has always been the Rum Boogie Cafe with dozens of autographed guitars, pulled pork, cold beer and if you're really lucky - The Billy Gibson Band. These cats are all pros and know how to turn on a crowd. From Keep on doing it to Polk Salad Annie this is one tight band. Makes me want to go back right now. Billy is a very cool guy who likes people as much as playing so maybe he will join you for a beer but for damned sure he will let you buy him one. This album is by personal favorite and is on my IPOD. Billy seems to play at every Blues Festival known to man or at least known to Steve Simon. Hope to see him at the big festival at Hunter Mountain, New York in August. Rock on."
3,Didn't fit for me.,"I when I tried to put the new RAM in my Acer Aspire One ZG5 Netbook, it didn't fit. If you have an Acer Aspire One ZG5, consider [...] because they guarantee their products will work with your hardware or your money back. The stick shipped ok, arrived on time, and was in perfect condition when I opened it. It's hard to say any more on this since it didn't fit."
4,A good deal,"Hi,I bought two 1GB RAMs for my IBM ThinkPad R51 Laptop to replace 256 MB and 512 MB RAMs . I checked on other sites and found this RAM to be cheaper at Amazon. Installation was easy as described in the Lenovo support. My Laptop recognized it instantly as I powered it back on. I am still on Windows XP and this additional RAMs have been providing extra juice for my laptop. Its been only a month since I have been using this, but I am satisfied with the way it is working.Though I have been a customer of Amazon for past 8 years, I never took time to review anything. I am extremely satisfied with Amazon's delivery. All my packages were delivered on time as promised.ThanksHemanth"
1,Did not work,"Was the right item for my laptop. Even called tech support for Crucial to confirm. I think was just unlucky to get defective memory. Now will have to order new one. To be safe, will go with PNY this time..."
5,Works great!,"My computer is soooo much faster! It was easy to install, took about 30 seconds. And my comp is doing much better. So far so good."
4,Patience Tested to the limit,"Have an old Packard Bell which was driving me mad. Memory was like mine, very poor. New Card has made a huge difference, like a new machine. Wish I could have one installed in my head."
3,"Crucial is excellent, but...","I've always had excellent success with Crucial and will continue to recommend it. However, this time I bought the memory for my netgear ReadyNAS Duo, which is ridiculously persnickity in terms of what memory it will accept. This module was originally on the HCL, which has now been taken down. When installed, it worked for about a day, then the unit became completely unstable and I had to revert back to the original memory. So, go ahead and order Crucial with confidence, but not this module for your Duo."
4,Crucial to consider,The product arrived in perfect new condition. It performed well since it was installed and no signes of conflect. It is a good product.
5,Great purchase!,This product works! I would recommend it to my mom and to a friend. My silver tableware shine like never!
5,SILVER RETURNS TO SILVER!,THIS CLOTH GOT ME AWAY FROM THE LIQUID CLEANERS THAT GET VERY MESSY. I HAVE A LOT OF SILVER JEWELRY AND WITH THE LIGUID IT TOOK ANYWHERE FROM 45 minutes TO 1hr & 15minutesAND THE ITEMS SEEM TO COME OUT CLEANER AND BRIGHTER. I RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT VERY HIGHLY!
2,A bit of a scam....,"This cloth is advertised as being 12"" x 15"".....it is two smaller pieces of cloth sewn together in the middle. I had planned to use this cloth as a drawer liner for my silver jewelry, which of course won't work with a big seam down the middle. So, beware. It does polish, though not spectacularly. I'd look for a better cloth."
4,Hell Wouldn't Stop Is Well Worth Reading,"Hell Wouldn't Stop is probably the most complete resource available concerning the invasion of Wake Island and the POW experiences of the survivors. The personal accounts are quite gripping. However, since this book is an oral history, given by survivors, and transcribed verbatim, most events are repeated very often but from the unique perspective of each survivor.The repitition gets tiresome occasionally but the author allows each man to tell his complete story, long or short, so these accounts do not appear edited.The survivors of the Wake invasion became the first POWs of the Pacific Theater. Their accounts are important since they spent the longest time in the brutal Japanese prisoner of war system.I recommend this book to anyone interested in WWII"
4,Another Good One!!,Adam's Fall ranks pretty high on my favorites list by Sandra Brown. I loved how all of the tension between them in the beginning ended up becoming the very reason for their inescapable passions. From the first page to the last it was interesting watching their words of hate and resentment turn to words of love and lust. Congratulations Sandra! You've done it again!!
2,Speculative Fiction?,"A friend urged me to read this book knowing that I had some interest in Arthurian lore and in feminist theory. The author has me puzzled on both accounts. It's not just that she posits some unusual ideas, it's the flat statements of fact she makes. I know of nothing that backs up some of her conclusions-- and the author does not support these statements with any citations. The first one that really brought me up short was something like, Guinevere's marriage contract with Arthur made her his archivist. That is not a direct quote but it's close enough. Marriage contract? Where did this document come from? And why would she be made her husband's archivist?So, if you are looking for ideas for speculative fiction about Guinevere this is the place to look. If you are looking for facts about Dark Age Britain then look elsewhere."
4,Thanks for clearing her name.,"My Mother named me Guinevere. I am thankful to Norma Goodrich for clearing up the issue of the name being associated with infidelity and dishonor. Often times I would be the brunt of jokes relating to Lancelot. At least now I have some rebuttal. Being a historian myself, putting the Arthurian legend in the 5th Century is makes sense. Goodrich's style does get off track and at times gives too much information without conclusion, causing confusion. I agree with other reviewers that her writing should be better. The writer John McPhee comes to mind as one who can reveal a subject such as geography/geology and make it exciting."
1,Unsecure holder,"After having my phone ""pop out"" of the holster and hit the concrete floor numerous times, I threw this away! Just could not get the phone to stay locked."
5,Cajun Pawn Stars Season 1 - So much better than Las Vegas Pawn Shop Show,"I love this show! It has all kinds of neat stuff. People bring in all kinds of junk and treasures. Very interesting to watch and as a result, educational as well. Like other pawn shop shows, they talk about the history of items that customers bring in. They show the negotiating and everything else that goes on. They have their quarrels and disagreements. The cameras keep rolling and capture every true moment that reality tv was designed to deliver to the audiences. All in all, a must see!!"
5,A Childhood treasure,"My fifth grade teacher helped me to appreciate this book. Everyday after lunch was a treat. My teacher selected a story from this book to read. This was an introduction to Black History before it became popular. In those day we celebrated ""Negro History Week.""As a teacher I read this book to my students. I purchased this book through Amazon.com. In this in day and time, this publication is not important. But I treasure it. I am happy to own a copy of ""Famous American Negroes."""
1,Owner's manual is Where ?,so the guy that originally put in my security light outside over my garage is no longer a neighbor and moved out of state so I decided after the flood in my house I needed a way to cool down the garage a bit and turn half of it into a room where we could store some stuff - so we had a fan installed IN the garage only to find out that we didn't have a nuetral wire for the security light outside over my garage - Now I can' find a owner's manual for it ... sad - can't find it in the house or on the internet....
1,not reliable at all,My wife wants these insecurity lights. I put up 5 of them. Over the last 5 years I've had to replace all of them at least once. Sometimes they just flash or go out on their own. If the power goes out then they might or might not come on again correctly. I loathe the awful Heath lights and would take them all down if I could.
2,A whispy primer,"This book (really a pamphlet - only 42 pages) shows examples of basic chart patterns such as trendline breaks, cup and saucer, retracements, gaps, consolidations, etc. The description of each one is very brief. You can usually get the same information for free by attending a charting lecture at your local investment club.On the other hand, it is brief, concise, and a good primer for someone just beginning to look at the world of technical analysis."
4,idiots fantasy baseball guide,its good if you are trying to learn the basics of fantasy baseball. Its really explained well but there is so much to know its abit tricky... should be interesting this season
3,A couple of true grit Nuge songs,"There are at least a couple of songs on this album that have serious balls like the songs we have grown up to know and love from terrible Ted. ""Good and Ready"" and ""Fightin' Words"". ""Good and Ready"" is the best song on the record, make sure you play it as loud as humanly possible."
1,"Was this the inspiration for ""Spinal Tap?""","I like Terrible Ted, but this album really is just plain terrible.I can't help but wonder if this is one the albums that became the inspiration for Rob Reiner to make ""Spinal Tap."""
4,Wonderful,"This is a truly fascinating and engaging work. The meaning of indepence from Great Britain is much more profound that one would think on first thought. With this idea in mind, Morgan penetrates to the fundamental ideas and characters of each three men. For both Washington and Adams, I must say that he is right on target. His account of Jefferson is also good, although I cannot help but wonder why Morgan spends some much time and space castigating the man for what he views to be his short-comings. Regardless of the actual merit of his criticisms, he clearly strays rather far from the subject of the work. Nevertheless, the piece as a whole is gem."
4,Looks great...,This is my son's first chess set. It came quickly and looks durable. Nice value as well. that is all.
1,dull,"This book took me a year to read because it was so easy to put down. The last 3/4's of the book could have been written tighly in maybe twenty pages and maybe not even worth it. Too simplistic, too underdeveloped. The Gail was dull and selfish and incredibly self centered. I little feeling for her except ""Boy that was stupid"". The worst of her books."

2,"You can do much, much better.","I had to force myself to listen to this 2CD set a second time. There really is nothing on this album that works for me. I'm into the progressive/epic trance, and this is neither. It is dark sounding, and doen't give any upbeat energy and emotion that I like in my music. Everyone has different tastes, so maybe this will work for you, but for me it didn't. Take a look at the reviews for Tisto, Acosta, Paul Van Dyk, Sasha/Digweed, Armin Van Buuren, DJ Micro, etc. If these artists are more your style of trance, stay away from this one."
3,"Feel Good, Cute, But Predictable","Dolphin Tale was a cute, feel good movie, but followed a formula and was rather predictable. There were many tender, heartfelt moments, and I cried first in sadness, then in happiness for Winter, the dolphin. Overall I enjoyed the movie, but loved Winter."
5,Great movie!!,"I can't believe the price I was able to get this movie for!! My kids saw this movie and loved it. When I saw it for the lightening deal on Amazon, I couldn't pass it up. Another excellent deal!! Amazon saved my Christmas!!"

2,Family movie,"Heart warming family story. Not everyone in our family would watch it start to finish bit of a chick flick, heart warming family story."
4,A terrific family film.,"A dolphin washes ashore and a young boy helps to save her. When the dolphin is cared for by a local rescue organization, the boy develops a bond with the dolphin and assists in her recovery from tail amputation. This storyline may sound overly sentimental, but the film isn't that at all. The film realistically portrays the rescue effort and adds the emotional connection of the boy and the Dolphin as a way to grab the audience. This is a delightful family that that will be enjoyed by adults and children alike."
5,My whole family loved this movie,"Sorry I have not sent a review sooner, but have had trouble with my computer. This was a gift to my grandson, but they whole family watched it and we all loved it.Dolphin Tale"
4,Dolphin tales,Great movie. My granddaughters loved this.nice family movie. makes for a good night to sitand have family night.
5,great entertaining,loved this movie great for all ages very touching to the heart. could watch it again when usually I watch movies only 1 time.
1,UltraViolet Blues,"I am not going to buy any video with UltraViolet as the sole digital copy. Digital copy is a feature we frequently enjoy but when it come via wireless streaming the availability is so limited that it becomes unusable for our needs. We travel overseas and the 9-12 hours on the plane plus the days/weeks out of the country often puts us in areas where internet is not available. We will, from now on, opt for the cheaper ""movie only"" version of the film and buy the real digital copy from iTunes."
2,Made for Tv,"Echo Bridge Home Entertainment sells these titles individually at around $10-13 each. There is value with this deal of 20 made for tv movies & mini-series. However, content is so subjective in a review so I'll just point out what I know about them. Most of the mini-series discs run close to 3 hours. No lossless soundtracks on any titles. Audio options average per title at 2 channel dolby or 2 channel LPCM with a few that have 1.5mbps dts. Each title is 1080p MPEG-2 encoded. I've watched most listed here & the video quality isn't that of a major motion picture studio title. That said, believe it or not most of these Blu-ray's are a step up over their dvd counterparts."
1,One Hidden Gem That Justifies This Cube,"I must echo the thoughts of the astute ""Dream Cardiologist"" in that this gift cube should be reserved for that person on your list whom you're debating on whether to give either nothing or a bag of dog poop...human poop if you really hate them.... Save yourself a potential lawsuit and jail time and present this alternative instead. Trust me, the message will be delivered just as strongly as a steaming bag of poop.Thank you Amazon, you really do look out for us all.P.S. If you do decide to give this gift, grab the Angel in the Family starring Meredith Baxter disc for yourself....Some of the hottest ABC Family smut you can find...may be worth the price of the cube alone and NO ONE in the know will ever question your possessing this gem in your collection. Don't believe me? See for yourself and thank me later...Ronny Cox is in it for God's sake!...http://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi4189454617/"
2,Buyer Beware!,"My low rating of this product has nothing to do with the artist's abilities or his material. Infact, Skip James was a master of Bentonia/Delta Blues. My problem is not with the seller either; the problem is with the manufacturer (Document Records). My case inserts say Skip James and the printing on the CD does too. However, the artist on the CD is not Skip James. It's actually a female blues artist named Georgia White. James and Georgia came from the same time period and both sang the blues, but that about all they had in common. So I got a factory defect - I'm not totally dissapointed though because Georgia White is an awesome artist that I wasn't aware of until this happy accident happened."
5,WOW!,What an excellent book this is. It't very easy to understand and has so many different projects to try. Full of great tips.
5,Very attractive book,This is a very attractive book for anyone (like myself) who is an amateur potter (not a complete beginner) but interested in learning more and getting inspiration. The instructions and photos are very clear and there are many useful tips and hints. I am very pleased with this book.
5,A must have for all Pau Simon fans!,This is a great production! I purchased after watching it on PBS. Lots of great talents covering lots of Paul Simons most popular songs. Really enjoyable!
3,OK But Not Great,I liked it but wish Paul Simon had a bigger role. I also would have liked more emphasis on his older songs which were good poetry besides being good songs. Most of the songs in this video were his later solo works which are good but I like his older works better. It was nice to see him being honored with this award but I don't think I would have bought it if I had been able to review it first.
4,a fun read,"The trials of coming to grips with who you are in the setting of typical high school cliques and angst are well told here. Most importantly, its a fun read. You root for our heroes Russel and Min and hope they make good decisions -- they don't always, but that's part of the fun!"
2,Thinks the audience is stupid,"I purchased this book, hoping to find a funny and riveting tale of growing up gay. Instead, I purchased a book whose author believes that his readers are unintelligent. The story itself was not all that bad (though a bit dull and predictable). However, the manner in which it was written was absolutely pathetic. Hartinger explains each and every thought the character is having with such detail that you begin to feel like he is patronizing you. There is one section of the book where a boy named Brian Bund does a nice deed for the main character, and Hartinger compares him to Jesus Christ dying on the cross! Sorry, Hartinger, but I don't think an unpopular boy who does something nice should be compared to a man nailed on the cross. All in all, I will agree with my fellow reviewers in saying that this book was a breeze to get through-but that was because everything was explained for us and did not contain one thought-provoking moment."
2,The breakout comedy of 1981,"I you are looking for thrills an chills in the form of a killer shark see a Jaws movie, Deep Blue Sea, Open Water The Reef or even Shark Night. If you want to see a blatant rip-off of one of the best movies of all time with horrible acting and worse SFX, this is the movie for you. Words can not accurately convey the depth of this cinematic train-wreck. You have to see it to believe it!"
1,Like Xeroxing a Van Gough,"I got the joke of the original Blues Brothers segments on ""Saturday Night Live,"" and I do think that they should be credited with reviving interest in a genuine American art form. But rather than buying this album why not seek out the real deal -- the original versions of these songs which crush these frat boy keg party covers like an elephant stomping a grape?"
3,Good replacement minor problems,"I had to reverse the stator on this one, it was spinning in the wrong direction, two screws, and nuts to remove, reversed the stator and it worked like a charm. Easy fix, could'nt find a replacement locally. googled the motor frame number had a link to this site. easy and cheaper than finding a new one at local stores. Which did'nt have them anayway."
5,A Piece of Musical History,"""Roger the Engineer"" was the British version of the American LP Over Under Sideways Down.""""Roger the Engineer,"" like most British LP's, featured more selections than the U.S. counterparts. Some of the selections were not even available on the American albums.Back in the days of vinyl, ""Roger the Engineer"" was a must-have for any Yardbirds fan. It was gem that at one time was available only as a British import.In my opinion, this was the Yardbirds at their peak. Great songs. Unlike the Yardbirds previous albums, this was also in true stereo.Now that we have progressed from LP's to CD's, ""Roger the Engineer"" is a must-have for any Yardbirds fan. It provides irrefutable evidence proving that the Yardbirds were a legendary band."
4,Great-- but too short!,"When this first came out, I preferred it over WELCOME BACK MY FRIENDS. This was recorded during the 1977 WORKS tour, when I somehow managed to see the band twice several months apart. I still remember listening to 2 fans on the subway ride home discussing the show and trying to figure out what that opening number was-- ""It sounded like something from a BOND movie!"", one said. ELP, of course, were the ones who ressurected Henry Mancini's PETER GUNN theme, and it's been covered endlessly by other bands ever since!However, this particular CD serves little purpose, as it has since been reissued with TWICE the amount of songs as WORKS LIVE. By all means-- get THAT instead!"
2,Mediocre book written at 8th/9th grade level,"This book is very simple introduction to basic business terms and concepts. Even for a freshman course at university this book is a bit thin. Be wary of any college-level course that lists this as a required book. If it is one of several, you may be alright but if it is the only one be wary."
3,Too Much Highlighting,This book had an exhorbitant amount of highlighting in multiple colors. That should have been mentioned by the seller.
2,Not for beginning students.,"A review that is missing is this caution to beginners: If you are new to the study of theology, Shedd's ""Dogmatic Theology"" not an ideal starter book.This book was required reading for a graduate level class in Christian doctrines, but as a beginner I found it was way over my head. I required multiple readings but usually did not know what Shedd was trying to say. Some classmates complained of the language also while others appreciated Shedd's attention to precise details.Shedd's unusual 19th Century language reminded me of Shakespeare. Shedd isn't exactly Shakespeare, but he's no Wayne Grudem, either."
4,Must reading for anyone uncomfortable with numbers.,"Paulos introduces us to mathematical concepts with a very real and easy to read style. He discusses our discomfort with numbers and shows simple ways to understand them and the relationships between them. He shows us how to apply mathematical concepts with ease. Also, the book includes a good primer on probabilities for those who consider them a ""black"" art.The one thing this book is lacking is an index."
1,A shot on video nightmare (it's that bad).,"Savage Island is a lame movie that was shot on digital video. No, the movie is not lame becasue it was shot on video. It's jsut plain dumb. The nonsensical plot , tedious acting and boring direction is what makes this movie lame.Nothing worth mentioning about this flick except find something else when you're at the video store.Not recommended."
5,Charlie's best!,"This is an incredible album. In listening, Charlie takes you from jazz to funk to latin to shuffle blues to percussive jam. An amazing experience that is accentuated by the drum trio and horn section (trombone and tenor sax) that joins him. Bottom line: this album is fun. Prepare to listen and be amazed! Check out ""Two For Bleu"" ""Cloud Splitter"" and ""Dersu""."
1,Faded high temperature black and blue engine enamel paint,"This degreaser is too agressive for engine spot cleaning. Small drip spots left on the blue valve covers of my old Cadillac faded the paint to a yellowish haze. Castrol Super Clean also faded the high temperature black enanamel to a grey haze around my old Mecedes engine. I found that Simple Green is slower but otherwise just as effective for spot degreasing. I need to let the Simple Green sit for 3 minutes vs 3 seconds for the Castrol Super Clean. It is too easy for some of the Castrol Super Clean to contact the painted surfaces around my engine, even when carefully using a rag. The Castrol Super Clean also irritates my skin, but Simple Grean does not.Gunk Enigine Brite is also just as fast Castrol Super Clean, and does not fade my engine enamels. However, it is much more expensive."

4,Great but not what's in the picture,"This is a great package of Toy Story character's however it's not the same as the picture. The picture shows woody, jessie(girl), zurg(evil robot), the horse, a little alien, and buzz. I wanted these characters for a cake I'm making. But instead I got woody, buzz, the little alien, the toy car, binoculars, the pig, t-rex, and little bo peep. Although I'm disappointed that it wasn't the character's in the picture which is what I wanted but I'll just have to re-do my cake design. The upside is there are more character's for my son to play with."
5,Movie,This movie came in great quality. It had no scratches or marks. I was very pleased and happy with my purchase.
4,Cage & Foreman shine on DVD and WIDESCREEN !!!,"For those waiting for ""Valley Girl"" to get the Special Edition treatment--the wait is over. Director Martha Coolidge gives unique insight into the film's production. The most interesting tidbits are the film's art department budget and how she chose the song ""I Melt With You"" for a key sequence. Missing from this edition, however, is Deborah Foreman. Virtually everyone else (Nicolas Cage included) contributes interviews and on-screen commentaries. Deborah, we love your work, like totally, fer sure. Your smile is so cute. Why were you a no show?"
4,Re-Release Please!,"I'm 16, so I was born the same year this movie was released. Obviously I never got to enjoy it in the theaters or expierence it the first time around. But I've seen it on TV, rented millions of times, and gotten my friends hooked on it too. This movie rocks; it is so much better than the teen movies today, I mean compare ""Can't Hardly Wait"" to this and you'll know what I mean. I know that there are thousands of you valley girls out there waiting for this movie to be re-released, let the companies know what you want, demand to be entertained, RE-RELEASE ""VALLEY GIRL""!"
4,Well acted,This was a well acted kids movie I saw when I was a kid. Nicholas Cage I thought was a freak at the time and now looking back he really showed what a good actor he would become.There are great nuances in this movie as well as some pretty good pop rock tracks.Lee Purcell is absolutely fantastic in her limited scenes as well as forever beautiful.
3,Not Good For Wheat Grass Juice,Screen is very weak and cracks when you make wheat grass juice. I broke two already and only had the machine for a few months. I've been trying to be very gentle with it. The customer service is not very good either.
5,Very good performance from this well-constructed juicer,"My sister recommended this juicer, so I purchased it. So far it has performed flawlessly and I am impressed by its solid construction."
5,Very happy juicer,"I had an old juicer that a friend had given to me when I decided to start juicing. When I realized I was serious about it and it wasn't going to be just a ""temporary"" commitment, I started looking and researching different kinds of juicers. When Amazon offered the Omega at such an amazing price, it was a no-brainer for me, so I ordered it and threw out my old one. It juices kale so much better than the other one which was a centrifical (or whatever you call it) and does extract much more juice too.Definitely would recommend this juicer!"
5,"Great Juicer, but are there other options?","I, a first time juicer, just got my omega juicer yesterday and juiced this morning. Great product, easy to clean and assemble. My only beef with juicing is that there is a good amount of remaining pulp. I thought it would be more fine or incorporated into the juice. I think I would have preferred a Vitamixer to get more pulp incorporated into the juice for a smoothie texture?"
1,"You're kidding, right? The new face of Omega juicers :-(","Omega used to be THE juicer brand, and we waited for a good sale to invest in one. Well, we were very disappointed. First, they now make the units in Korea - Omega used to be made in the USA. This model, now made in Korea, is VERY cheap. It's all plastic parts, even the base was a cheap plastic with chrome finish. The chute could barely fit a full carrot or celery stick in it - EVERYTHING has to be chopped up or dissected in order to fit. To juice an orange, you have to put in individual orange segments! The juice and pulp cups are also extremely tiny and made of cheap plastic that probably contain BPA. This juicer really looks like a child's toy and we laughed in total disbelief when we unpacked the box. This one just isn't for us."
5,Omega J8005-Love it!,"We purchased our Omega on February 4th. It arrived shortly after and we began juicing that night. We have used it at least once a day since the day that it arrived. My husband and I have never had a juicer before, but I did extensive research before we bought this one. Since juicing was new to us we did not want to buy the more expensive juicers on the market. We decided to stay in the middle of the road as far as the price goes, as we were afraid it would end up being an unused appliance taking up space on our counter.Both of us feel so much better since we began juicing. We just have fruit juice in the morning and vegetable juice at night (something healthy for lunch) and the results were evident in the first couple of weeks. We look better and feel good!Since this is the first juicer we have owned, I maybe shouldn't give this juicer a rating of ""5"". But, I can say, after using it everyday - sometimes twice a day, we love it!"
1,do not buy the omega j8005,"Keep shopping, I do not recommend this product as it is lacking in quality. The grinding component is plastic, it is slow, and it has a very small hole to put your fruits and veggies in. I had to quarter carrots lengthwise to juice. I used once and I returned."
3,"Juicer was good, customer service is not","I've been able to juice with this three times so far (wheatgrass only), and those three times were great. Certainly better than the previous juicer I tried. At the end of my 3rd juicing session, the screen broke. I contacted Omega via email for warranty replacement, and never heard anything. When I called them, I experienced ""longer than normal hold times"" before I finally got to a human that told me yes, my replacement order was in the system (thanks for telling me!) and that the screens were backordered and expected ""next week"". It's now two weeks later, and I still don't have a screen. I called again, and after three calls where I was hung up on as I was being connected (didn't sound like a connection problem; it sounded like a person picking up, then hanging up, a handset), I was told that the screens are still backordered and expected ""next week"". I have now been without the juicer almost as long as I was able to use it."
5,Amazing,"This is the most amazing juicer ever. It is soooo easy to clean, and the left over pulp is so dry that it crumbles in your hands. Worth the investment!"
4,Good product,"Great juicer, but the tiny chute found on most if not all these masticating juicers is a major downfall for a first time juicer. I should have listened and bought a centriifigul juicer.I'm a college student with two jobs, have slowly changed my life habits to consume more raw or fresh food. It took me about half an hour to set up my juicer and get my veggies clean and trimmed to be juiced. The pulp was still fairly moist, but it did a good job with all but the softest of veggies/fruit. The container was quite small for the amount of juice I made. I ended up making a mess by letting juice drip out during container changes and had vegetable trimmings everywhere because you have to cut size.I returned the juicer to get a new centrifigul juicer one day. Hopefully with a bigger chute, faster operating time and a large container so I dont have to replace often and make a mess."
4,No problems yet,"No problems yet, it juices well. I don't have a tone of experience with juicers, but they are all not fun to clean, this one is no exception. I would buy this product again."
4,great juicer,"For the money a good juicer,I purchased this for my husband so needed to be easy to use and clean,also able to juice greens like Kale and strong leaf greens.So far has been great,we love it,I use the pulp in my compost so nothing wasted,there are plastic parts which I feel could be an issue long term,too early to tell yet."
