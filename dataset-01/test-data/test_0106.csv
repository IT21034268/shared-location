2,Palm or Visor?,"I tried a Visor Deluxe for a couple of days (I am a Palm user) and the quality is definetly lower than the palms, not only you can *FEEL* the difference but it usually crashes... I think the IIIxe is a much BETTER choice. Expansion slot? MP3?, well, I really dont see any future for that extra considering price, battery life, .."
3,Only a little disappointed,"Several months ago I bought my Handspring Visor after several years as a hardcore Franklin Planner user, and have been generally pleased with it. I use the calendar and phone book functions religiously and do not have any complaints with those functions. I have only briefly experimented with a couple of the downloadable programs which are available, and due to their lack of functionality in my life, I'm indifferent to them.My disappointment stems from the fact that I paid ..for it and two months later the Edge came out and they dropped the price of the Visor. Additionally, I find the stylus a little difficult to use at times. I assume I would experience this problem with all PDA's.If I hadn't paid so much for it I'd probably go back to my Franklin Planner. If you're a tech junkie, buy the Edge. If you want a decent PDA without spending too much money, buy the Visor."
2,Extremely disappointed after 4 months,"I purchased this product four months ago, and I have had it replaced four times already. The first Visor Deluxe lasted two months, as did the second one; the third one lasted three days. The device will simply freeze up during use, and resetting it does not work. Furthermore, Handspring cannot provide a reason for the malfunction. Although Handspring and Palm may share operating platforms, Handspring certainly has inferior hardware."
2,Not always reliable,"At first I was happy with it, but then screen cracked (a common problem). Sent for replacement.The replacement did not work at all. Sent it back. Third one freezes all the time. I got out of the habit of using it (this whole exchange took several months and the month I really needed it came and went while it wasn't working) and it is not reliable because it freezes. I bought it because it was much cheaper than the palm and because of the modules, but I would probably not make the same decision if I had to do it all over again. If you need a reliable product more than you need bells and whistles (in the form of modules) I would not recommend this product."
2,Unreliable,"I have had my VDx for about 15 months. I used it daily, but would occasionally get ""Fatal error"" messages which required a hard reset and the loss of my most recent data. Finally my original unit died. I called customer service,which is NOT an 800 number and waited 15 minutes to get through. They sent me a replacement ""refurbished"" unit which was defective. I then went through the same procedure on the phone and amazingly got another defective unit!I have had it with Handspring and will look elsewhere for my next PDA."
1,Nothing to rate,Well I would love to write a good review but I ordered this product on 4/24 and I just found out today (5 days later)that the seller I bought it from can't deliver me the product because he's out of town... Maybe the face to face purchase at my local electronics store is the best way to go.Doug
5,reat Product,"I will be short and sweet. It a great prodicut. I had ZERO trouble getting it set up and working with my USB Macintosh system. I find the desktop software to be excellent, and no issues with hotsyncing.All in all, I am impressed with ease of use, thoroughness of software and price."
3,"Fragile, but push for free replacement screen!","Indeed the Visor is very fragile and you should always keep it in its leather case, to damp any shocks from it falling, even on carpets. It happened to me, and I was told I had to pay $85 for a replacement. I refused to do that, stating that a) although they SAID the screen was exempt from warranty it wasn't WRITTEN anywhere in the manual or online in their warranty declaration; b) it is mentioned only far back in the electronic manual how sensitive the screen is, whereas it should be noted on the first pages of the (poor) printed manual. By placing the info in the electronic manual they assume everyone has a PC to read it, which is unfair. So, with these arguments I got my replacement screen for free."
4,A very good PDA,"This is a very nice PDA, with lots of features and expandable. USB-equipped cradle works very well on my PC, with fast data syncing between the Visor and the PC. On improvement Handspring needs to have, however, is the quality control on these handhelds. I've had a chance to get my hands on three brand new Visor Deluxes out of the box, and the clicking of the control buttons feel differently on all three of them. Worst yet, on one of them the actual digitzer area on the touch screen is shifted a little toward the side (meaning is not exactly located evenly in the middle). The Visor is very well constructed, and the genereal feel of the buttons is very good, but certainly can stand improvement in better quality control."
3,Disappointing for Bond,"I recently checked out the audio book format of The Enemy Within, expecting it to be as good as Vortex, arguably one of the best books ever written. I was disappointed with this one. The Thorn character seemed a little too heroic. Especially in the part where he defies the President's orders. It's kind of like, ""Screw the President, I know better than my commander-in-chief."" So he risks the life of his team to go hunt down his friend-turned-arch enemy and get revenge for his girlfriend who was mortally wounded in the line of duty. I like the scenes of the terrorist attacks, which are well written, and the Tomahawk attack on Iran is awesome. After these, the book fades out. A readable book, but definitely not Bond's best."
3,Just what you'd expect,"This book does its job adequately. The dialogue is typically awkward and many characters are wooden. The breakthrough moment for the plot is extraordinarily farfetched and the resolution seems harried.That said, the story moves along crisply and the terrorist atrocities it presents are unnerving, to say the least. And suprisingly, the romance (which is usually terribly botched in this genre) is quite endearing. Fans of the genre will be generally pleased."
3,Amazing plot,"An astonishing book by a great writer.I was overwhelmed by the indirect, yet ingenious ways to accomplish an objective. It showed me how full of vulnerable areas we are in our days of comfort. That it is the small things(that usually goes unseen) which, when assembled have the power to overwhelm anything in it's path. Unfortunately i must agree that the book ends off a bit too quick, a lot of detail has been left out in the last parts. But nevertheless it was a great book and well worth reading."
5,His writing just keeps getting better!,This book kept me hook until the last page! I will have to read Combat next!
5,Great indicator,I use this indicator at work. It's accurate and has good repeatability. Amazon had the best price. I liked the fact that it came with the rod and the clamp. Highly recommended.
2,So-so at best,"I loved the first Black Company book. I found the second and third books to be entertaining, but not really in the same class. I read this book fourth, and found it to be hardly recognizable as the work of the same author. The characters are unsympathetic and one-dimensional, and the plot meanders without rhyme or reason. The climax is a yawner and the denouement is neither believable nor satisfying. From reading the other reader reviews it is clear that some Black Company fans enjoyed this one. . . I just hope that the later books in the series recapture some of the gritty, imaginative writing of the original."
5,Damn,"Clean as a whistle, so surprised, I am not sure if it was used or not but it was definitely in amazing shape."
4,The Bedford Reader- used,this book was in excellent condition for a used book. no marks and the binding was in good shape and all pages are in good condition.
3,A step backward.,"""Winds Of Change"" #26 (1982).After the classic ""Modern Times"", 7th studio album ""Winds Of Change"", is a letdown. This album had good songs, but there was more filler here. It starts off with the smoking' title track #38 hot 100 and #18 MSR, with Mickey and Grace sharing leads. The ballad ""Be My Lady"", #33 hot 100, with some good guitar by Craig. The rocking ""Black Widow"", ""I Will Stay"", had a nice gospel sound and the A.O.R. smash ""Can't Find Love"" #16 MSR. ""Nuclear Furniture"" followed in 1984."
1,It totally SUCKS!!!!!,"this CD sucks!!! The constant paddling of the water is annoying. i was expecting a soft, tranquail, and soothing sound but instead got a the sound of some guy trying to paddle out of his bath tub!!!!"
5,Hysterical Horse People,"This is one of the most hysterical books I've ever read. I thought it was so funny I had to e-mail the author to tell her what great laughs she had given me. (She has another book coming out in June.)My husband read it first, on an airplane, and I was reading over his shoulder and we were hooting out loud. We are trail-riding horse people, but not dressage riders. If you know anything about horses at all,whatever your ""discipline,"" and the people who surround them, you will appreciate this book. I have ordered numerous copies for Christmas presents for all my friends for next year."
4,"LMAO Funny, charming and full of wit","Once I picked up Horseplay it was hard to put down. So hard that I actually finished it in one day. Not an easy to do feat for me since I do have a horse etc that are needing attention nearly all the time.""Judy"" was me just a mere 14 years ago. Although I was being screamed at in Finnish, not German. And the horses I was paired with were not anywhere near as hoity toity.If you love Jennifer Cruse and you love horses. And you need a friend, or two that are just as crazy as you are. Read this book. Just make sure no one else needs you for a bit"
3,No Ending to The Return of the King Story,"The pictures illustrated are very good but unfortunately I found that my copy of ""The Return of the King"" ends at the picture of Frodo and Sam climbing up Mt. Doom with Gollum trailing behind. It doesn't go any further...what happens to the ring, the results of the battle at the Black Gate, the coronation, etc. are all missing from the book. If I were to show it to children/adults they would be wondering what happen's next. Climbing up Mt. Doom is not a way to end a story."
3,"Beautiful Crystals, but Why?","A great deal has been made about the influence of chemicals on the structure of water. This documentary demonstrates purported effects of sounds, thoughts and even printed words on water. The technique for producing the crystals is demonstrated, but not explained. Indeed, there is a striking lack of scientific integrity underlying the demonstrations. For example, only some of the crystals from a sample look beautiful; most drops of water do not form beautiful crystals. Also, the crystals form as the frozen drop of water warms up under a microscope, not as the water freezes. Apparently, the crystals form as moisture in the atmosphere freezes onto the very thoroughly frozen drop of water. All this is without explanation. The documentary alludes to the successful use of specially prepared water in the treatment of diseases, but provides no explanation. Still, as was said in ""What the Bleep Do We Know!?"", if thoughts can do this to water and our bodies are 90% water..."
3,"""watered"" down","I have fallen in love with the science of life... however I felt this dvd to be a bit insipid. Perhaps it had something to do with the japanese to english translation (It seemed the english subtitles were rather condensed compared to the dialogue... by the way, I do not speak japanese). I sort of feel like I could have made a better choice by buying the book rather than the dvd... I think I may pick up Alexandra Bruce's book (Beyond the Bleep) instead."
2,"Disappointing follow up to ""What the bleep....:",I love this topic as discovered in What the Bleep. However this book as a follow up is a disappointment. It is basically a documentary of how the scientists did the experiments and does not really expand on the significane of the findings or offer any new eye opening insights. The DVD is especially boring to watch. The book at least has some nice pictures.
4,A good edition of the standard Kemp Smith translation,"This is the standard English edition of Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON. Perhaps the recent Guyer/Wood translation is better, but the scholarly literature of course does not yet refer to it. So you need to own the Kemp Smith."
1,This version of Critique if pure reason is awful!,"This version is not, to the best of my knowledge, a true version of the actual book! It doesn't even list an author or who edited it. It doesn't have a table of contents and is loaded with typo's! It went in the trash and I'm looking for a better rendering of it!"
4,clarifications,"For those who read the editorial review, know that the ""paperback version"" is actually an entirely different translation, and while it is abridged, this version is not.So, for those who read the editorial review and were concerned that this translation was abridged, don't worry, it isn't.However, for those of you who read the editorial review, which sings the praises of the editor, and think that you're getting a version of innordinately high quality in this book, you're not. the translation is very awkward at points. it still gets the point accross, just sometimes with little attention paid to grammar."
1,Anti-reason = anti-thought = anti-life,"This book is good to read if you understand that it's completly socialistic, and anti-thesis."
5,Arguably the best rock album of the 20th Century,"Written and recorded during one of the most historical periods for rock music--1969--this album has it all: blues, rock, some folk, and even touches of heavy metal. I bought this cd in 1997, and it is only one of a few in my collection that I can listen to from beginning to end. It is truly amazing how such an album has had so much direct influence on music for the past 30+ years. If you listen to many of the popular rock bands today, it is easy to trace their influences back to Led Zeppelin and especially this album. This was Led Zeppelin at its highest....no other albums or songs would quite compare to Led Zeppelin II...and no other bnad has quite been able to match it."
5,The Greatest Rock album Ever!,"Nobody touches this album in rock history. Its worth the money just for ""A whole Lotta Love"". Any serious rock collection must include this album and Zoso. Enough said."
5,The second helping satisfies most,"British blues, which began to gather steam in the early '60s with Alexis Korner, John Mayall and others, reached a pinnacle in 1969 upon the release of LED ZEPPELIN II. The group's first album hadn't done much in the U.S., but a summer tour of the States as opening act for Chicago Transit Authority helped to greatly publicize this new offering. ""Whole Lotta Love"" was a megahit that autumn of '69, and it seems every high school and college-age kid was tuned in to Led Zeppelin from that point on.LED ZEPPELIN II is one of those rare albums without a single weak track. Blues, heavy metal, hard rock-- there's something here for everybody. The term ""classic rock"" was invented for sets like this. Give it a listen, but be sure to say ""Thank You.""TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 41:33"
2,Thunderous?,"I must say that I don't understand how you reviewers can describe this album as ""thunderous"".When I first heard Whole Lotta Love I thought to myself "" it sounds like he's playing a toy guitar, a plastic guitar"". I honestly thought it was a quiet intro before the real hard song began.The reviewer who said that no albums rocks quite as hard as this one must have a very small record collection. However before you Led Zeppelin fans damn my soul to the fiery pits of hell, I have to say that I do quite like this album because the toy guitar sound and cute songs like Thank you and What Is And what Should Never Be bring back some lovely childhood memories of being taking to Santa's Magic Grotto and seeing the elfs,the first time I saw Bambi in the theatre with my parents , and the nice birthday cake I got for my fourth birhday( it had a lovely little pink sugar mouse on it)"
5,Led Zeppelin II,"This is a classic album. To those of you who chose to buy, a word of advice. Don't just skip the slower songs like ""What Is..."" and ""Thank You"" in favor of more upbeat songs like ""Heartbreaker"" and ""The Lemon Song."" Listen to the whole album from start to finish in one sitting. The feeling I got from doing this was something no other album has given me. What will happen is a musical journey from a loving relationship's peak ""Whole Lotta Love"" to its ending ""Heartbreaker"" and eventual resolution ""Bring it on Home."""
5,Just the start of something big...,More raw edged hard rock and roll from the best rock band ever. Early ZEP at its best!
1,poo,"i dont know what all the fus is about lep zepplin sucks always had always will if you know about true metal you would consider to that and stay as far away posible from this piece of crap band called ""led zepplin"" and help your self to some Iron Maiden instead."
3,Disillusioned,"I used to like Led Zeppelin, but they've soured on me because it seems that many of their songs are ""borrowed"" or ""adapted"" from old blues songs.Imagine my disappointment.They really weren't that original at all.This album still has some good songs, but I can't really recommend any other albums to new listeners, except maybe Physical Graffitti."
5,My All Time Favorite,"I listen to all kinds of music, except for rap and country, and this is by far my favorite album. I first heard Led Zeppelin II at age 15, when I found it in my parent's record collection. I had listened to dozens and dozens of their records, liking some of what I heard, but usually putting the record back in its sleeve and moving on to another one.When I put Zepp 2 on the the turntable, it stayed there! For a long time, there was no need to listen to anything else. Fifteen years have passed, and no other album compares to this one. Even the various Led Zepp live renditions of these same songs don't hold a candle to the original studio recordings. I suspect this will be my favorite album until the day I die. I cannot see anything ever replacing it.Mark McGinty is the author of ""Elvis and the Blue Moon Conspiracy"""
5,Great CD,The Best Zeppelin CD ever! What else can be said about this album? I can only wish they were still making music but will always like this one for sure.
5,Led Zeppelin makes it's mark,"Although I love Led Zeppelin's debut, it's a confused collection of songs by a band that hasn't really found it's sound yet, but on Led Zeppelin II, the line between blues and hard rock starts to blur and Led Zeppelin finds it's own style, set apart from their blues and hard rock heroes. Two examples of this are the Blues/rock masterpiece ""The Lemon Song"" and the smooth, jazzy ""What is and What Never Should Be"". Another favorite of mine is ""Bring it all Back Home"" because it just plain rocks, but the real masterpiece of Led II is the opener, ""Whole Lotta Love"". It's a hard rock anthem and that opening guitar is classic, like this album."
5,SUPERRRR!!!!!,"The best album that this group has done. Years ago I,d listen it in vinile, when the CD's are far away miles and miles, with scratches, jumps etc., I'd have recorded it onto a tape that I keep as a ""Reliquia"" and I'm continuing still now to listen it into my car. Really, really the best."
4,Don't read this book by its cover,"This is an excellent item for a booklover to have, as detailed by other reviewers. Be careful, though-- The book is not the luscious item, with embossed title, ribbon closing, and included bookmark, that is suggested by the photo. The ""photo"" is actually the artwork on the cover of the real book, which is bound blank-book style."
5,A wonderful gift for book lovers! I love it !,"My sister ordered this book for me for my birthday. I was so excited when I opened the package and found the wonderful pages to document my reading, copy favorite quotes, list books I loved as a child (and still do), keep track of books I want to read, and more. This simple organizer is lovely! It has numerous wonderful quotes about books and reading from various sources. I took several evenings to browse through it thoroughly. I still enjoy just looking at it. The paper is of a very high quality. The colors are minimal to prevent competition with the reader's entries. If you love reading, get your hands on this little gem to store all your favorite memories of books!"
1,Great actors undercut by terrible direction,I got this because the principal actors are so excellent. But the movie is so slow and boring with so many half-hearted plot elements I could hardly watch it.
1,Helpful only as an overall reference to the PCAT,"The book was helpful as additional set of questions for practice. The test questions, however, were misleading and tricky, which was not true of the actual PCAT. Each section seemed to be written by a different person and there was no consistent method to the presentation of the material. The Biology section did not explain the answers at all, so there was no opportunity to learn from mistakes. Other sections were somewhat better. I found the study skills and test taking tips section to be of little or no value. The overview of the mechanisms that have been developed to describe how people learn was of no value at all."
2,Dry as the Texas soil,"This was probably the driest history book I have ever read. With all the exciting things that happened in Texas history, it would be easy to spice this book up. However, Fehrenbach spends more time on agriculture and geography that the actual history of the state. He goes on for pages on minor events and minor governors, but then breezes by others like the Mexican-American War. I've read many history books that monotonous, but this one was just flat boring. Furthermore, the author justifies the killing and suppression of Indians, Negros, and Mexicans by Texans becuase they were inferior and did not deserve the land. This at times made me very uncomfortable.The author needs to seriously think about whether he is writing a history book, or a detailed description of every rock in Texas. I would not recommend this book for people interested in Texas history, but could be used as a resource for students."
4,Great Modem,"This modem is great albeit bulky, making it impossible to fit into any form-fitting cases. The bulk comes from its AAA battery compartment. Having its own batteries keeps the drain on the Visor as low as can be expected from online activity. Don't think 33.6 is a slow speed for Palm-based devices. Data in the Palm world is much smaller than its PC equivalent. IRC, ICQ, e-mail, and web-surfing... you can do it all with this modem."
2,A Snap Shot not a Story,"There was no story in this book, just snap shots of life. Nothing really happened, it was like a smooth flow of water, undisturbed and undeterred. If I thought that this book would give me an insight into an Indian family, I was not satisfied. The characters in Uma's family seemed to be stereotyped, following a well defined path and so was Uma. She was not happy with her life, but she didn't want to do anything about it. So the story just stayed in one place, never moving, never changing course. Arun was even more of a mystery. We never really got to know him. He just floated around without any anchor and without purpose. Unlike other books written by Indian writers, this book was written well. There were no long winding descriptions and horrendously constructed sentences. This is a good book to read, but don't expect Booker Prize quality, whatever that means. The last three Booker Prize winners I read, disappointed me."
1,OMG WORST BOOK EVERRRR,"this is truly the worst book ive ever read. im soon 2 burn it. we had 2 read it for school, thats the only reason i finished it. it was horribly written, no plot and just outright boring. if your looking for a good read, FIND ANOTHER BOOK!!!!"
5,A tragedy of mistakes,"Mr. Klein is a bitter tale about an exquisite marchand, in the middle of the war. Suddenly he's caught for burocratic mistake for other Klein from jew ascendence .This is the dramatic focus of this dark picture. Joseph Losey once more swims in his favorite theme : the cruelty and moral decline in the nazi environment.Delon makes a magnificent performance as the disturbed Mr. Klein.The ending is unforgettable!Acquire this jewel."
2,Cheap,This was a gift from Santa to my 3 1/2 year old son. Parts on the tow truck and police bicycle just came right off within the first hour my son played with them after opening it on Christmas morning. Not good quality at all.
5,A violinist rates it!,"I have been playing the violin for 18 years and I ordered this for my birthday. I love this violin! It came with a lot of extras that others don't offer, including the fine tuners! It was really easy to set up. All I had to do was make the notches in the bridge, which is easy. The strings were already put on, they just needed tightened. This is my first electric violin, and I am very happy with it so far. I have been carrying it around with me everywhere and it makes me want to practice more! It's a great violin for anybody wanting to get into playing!"
4,great violin,The violin the headphones and the rosin are great. And the only thing stoping me from giving 5 stars is the bow isnt that great. Frog is to narrow and needs a shoulder rest. I got the setup and the box was broke and so were the strings. The seller is making it rite by sending me new strings. Great seller and great product for the money.
2,"It arrived with a moldy case, and the pegs are unusable","One thing is to recieve a cheap product and another is receive something that's molding through. I had to wash the canvas ""case"" from the molding on it, as well as rub down the violin and stuff. I thought I was getting a half priced 100$ quality violin, but I really received something worth about half of the 60 something that I paid.Sound quality is pretty nice, however the biggest issue is that the violin won't stay tuned for longer than 2 minutes. The pegs are garbage and I am still trying to find a way to make this violin playable."
5,What Fun,This is great fun. Love practicing with the headphones on. It's a different experience from regular violin and is quieter for those around you who don't love your music as much as you do.
1,If I would have know this condition I would never have bought it.,"When I first opened it up, I was excited, compared to the reviews, I thought minor repairs wouldn't be that bad. There is a small chip on it which the 4th string catches on, and if it does at least it's staying in place, Otherwise it easily falls under the neck, and the key to turn and tune it will not tighten at all to fix this. The receiver under the cords are loose. And I can only hear noise when I pluck the strings with my fingers and I hear nothing when it comes to using the bow EVEN with it plugged into my amp. Otherwise, yes, it came with all that they said it came with, but this Violin needs more work than I want to put into a new instrument. I'm returning it, and never buying this kind ever again. Want a Electic Violin? Please save yourself the trouble and look at another."
3,meets requirements,"Not pleased with this item I purchased one of these brands a few years ago and needed another one so I googled the name brand to see what I woyld find and found this and it looks like the one I had purchased in the past but when it came I found it to be smalled in size, cheaply made (the holder is deformed) and flimsey. It was very expensive and not realy worth the price I spent on it. I kept it only because I didn't want the hasle of returning it for a refund and am using it"
4,Great Book... Could have been better with more transition between scenes,"My Little Girl is about a little gal who is looking forward to spending the day with her daddy. They are going to have a `wonderful, better than chocolate ice-cream with sprinkles' kind of day. But when her dad tells her that they are going to do nothing in particular she is worried her day will be no fun.The story was very cute and had a wonderful message about just enjoying the small things of life with those precious to you; taking time out to find the 'special' in the mundane and enjoy it. Ducks doing the samba, new-born bunnies, even brushing your teeth all have wonderful joyous potential when experienced with those we love. I especially appreciated the emphasis on fathers spending time with their little girls. There are not enough books about that out there.If you buy this book for no other reason, buy it for the pictures. They are wonderful!"
5,No 'stranger' to excellent fiction.,"You've read it before - handsome rich man meets beautiful woman, they fall in love, happily ever after.Not!What's the message of this book? That greedy, ruthless, manipulative people sow the seeds of their own destruction? That not even love can last forever? That secrets will out, and acts of betrayal have shattering consequences? Read this book - not just as an antidote to Judith Krantz or Jackie Collins, nor just as a dark-side-of-Hollywood peek, but as a mesmerizing story about two people who could have had the world, but instead loved and destroyed each other."
2,Not Recommended,"I didn't enjoy reading it, no one seems to have any values, so much of spite and hatred, it really leaves a bad taste in the mouth."
3,An average Novel by SS,"I have read SS books before. Most of them are gripping thrillers - this one is not like them . its more r like a biography of a star - his failure, pain, agony, success and finally his death. Still it makes to sit & read .. after sometime u feel for him & adore him. Thats the success of SS narration.The behind the scene of Hollywood is told in detail.Looks like most of them r inspired from real life incidents. The book starts with good suspense speaking abt the incidents in the ship.Then somehow it drags in the middle and goes for a perfect climax."
3,Not sure I got a true Libbey product,"I purchased the dinner plates, salad/dessert plates and rimmed bowls. They arrived in great condition - no breaks, cracks or chips. I was very concerned, however, that no where on the box or on the sticker on each piece did it say ""Libbey."" I was very hesitant to open up the other two boxes because I could tell by the outside that they were all made in Mexico, minus the ""Libbey"" product name and did not have whether it was rated for microwave, dishwaster safe etc. I did not pay for a ""no-name"" company to be substituted for a name I know and trust. If Libbey is in fact behind this product - wouldn't you expect to see their name boldly displayed on the packaging?! Frustrated to say the least!After examining carefully the plates I opened, I decided to keep them as they seemed to be well made. Time will tell..."
5,Love These Plates,"I wrote a review for the Salad/Dessert plates also, and we feel the same about the dinner plates. They go with any decor, they're strong, dishwasher and microwave safe, and we would buy them again."
2,Poor quality,"Half of these were pretty bad, very wavy glass, I would have been embarrassed to ship them. The size and shape and weight on the rest is what I was looking for though."
4,Great plates.....poor packaging,"Received the plates in 2 days. The plates are great!!!! I guess they used to be made in the USA, but now are made in Mexico. Packaging was horrible!!!! The tape was coming off the box. One plate was broken. I chose not to send it back, because of the hassle. I hope Amazon can remedy the poor packing."
3,"Pleasant, suspenseful, and a bit improbable","Not quite up to the author's first novel, 'The Martyr's Chapel',this is still an engaging story with good plot twists. A bit improbable in places - e.g., a general officer of the U.S. Air Force bursts into a clearing (what's there? The Judas Tree!) with another officer and bullies some of the characters in the story. The general's involvement in the plot becomes apparent but this scene is almost in a bubble. The characters are generally likeable (or not) and knowing that this book will not get mired in gore, sex, etc. makes it a pleasure to read. I'd like to see more from this author."
2,Disappointing,"A quick glimpse at the book store persuaded me that this was a potentially good , or at least adequate read. At first, it wasn't bad, as though the author had actually tried to build a good story.Sadly, the story falls apart at the end, with a comepletely unbelieveable climax, brought on by the cheap plot trick of holding back information from the reader, and introducing new characters to deliver it. Furthermore, one character described as frail and old and ill suddenly morphs into a sly, quick-moving and powerful danger, now with a ""beefy arm"". The entire conclusion was completely lame, makeing it seem that the author was in a hurry to slap the book together and be done with it.I was unimpressed. Normally, when I discover a writer new to me, I try to find all the books he has published, knowing I can trust him for a good read. In this case, I won't bother."
3,over the dark,I picked one of these up after nearly breaking my legs during a fall on a stairway because of the dark. The hostel I was staying in normally has lights but the rowdy guests broke every bulb in the place. I left this out & it worked for a while until some drunk Germans tore it out. Best thing to do is to carry a mini flashlight in instances like that.
3,earrings,"The earrings are lovely. The only problem I have had is the butterfly clasps that came with the earrings. The first time I wore them one of the earrings fell out! I did notice the clasp was loose when I put the earrings on, but I didn't expect it to fall off. Luckily I realized the loss before leaving the house and found the earring. I'd hate to lose the lovely anniversary gift my husband surprised me with."
4,it's a good deal!,"very simple yet nice & sparkling. bought these for my 2nd piercing so the size is just perfect,otherwise,it's quite small to be noticed if you try to wear the pair alone."
3,Silver Pennies,A very special book. I was surprised that the book was not in better condition. There were several places where the pages had pulled away from the spine. I would say that the condition of this book was just a bit below average. Speed of delivery and packaging were good.
3,It's Okay,"Only a few patterns in this book that really interest me, one of them being on the front cover. Many are very dated. A few classics in there and the patterns are well written."
2,Sweaters could be better,"On the one hand, this knitting book is easy to understand. The instructions and materials list is straightforward, unlike other knitting books I've seen. And the sweaters are pretty cute. There are matching sweaters for mother-daughter and father-son pairings, and so on.The down side is that many of these patterns aren't very appealing. Sure, they're ""cute"" to look at, but to be honest, most people today won't be proud to go out wearing sweaters like these. They're not very trendy, and for this reason I think it would be better to find a knitting book with attractive sweaters that are difficult to make, instead of this book right here. Oh, and there aren't that many projects focuses solely on crochet. There are knitting projects that involve some crochet work, but if you only do one craft or the other, you can't even do those projects at all!"
5,An excellent CD of subtle Hawaiian slack key sounds.,Island Treasures and Kohala by Kohala are both excellent listening music. No vocals. Great background music with a hint of jazz while communicating the pleasant sounds of Hawaii.
3,Pleasant ride,I hadn't read the book so I had no expections except that Lublum is known for telling a good yarn. The movie was pretty quickly paced.I realized about half way through the movie that it was shot entirely in Europe with simple inserted exterior shots of D. C. area locates. It isn't a kid's film but I was glad that there wasn't overloaded with excessive violence and sex that some filmmakers use to pump up an otherwise weak film.
3,Average,"I didn't care for it at all. For an action movie this wasn't very entertaining. I read the book sometime ago and enjoyed it but the movie doesn't even come close. Matt Damon is a very poor choice for this role with this boy next door looks and bland personality. I also don't know what's with the ridiculous role that Julia Stiles was playing, it was very annoying. Don't bother."
3,Good Action Movie for a Saturday Afternoon,"Not a bad movie . . . but not a particularly memorable one, either. It's got a lot of good action, but there's very little exploration of the background or personality of Jason Bourne, despite the fact that this is the central point of the movie. Instead, it focuses too much on being an action movie, with mysterious people trying to kill him for reasons unknown.This is a rare movie in that the movie is better than the book. The only thing the book did better was explore the complexity of the main character's past.Pick it up some Saturday afternoon. It's good for a few hours' entertainment- but if you want a movie that will be a little more memorable, grab the original instead."
3,A VERY loose adaptation of the book...,"For the most part, this is a pretty straight-forward action film. While it has a different setting and different stars than what we're used to seeing, it has the standard car chases, fistfights and gun battles that we're used to seeing in this kind of movie. Damon was good, as was Franka Potente, but there was really nothing to set this film apart from any other.The thing that drove me nuts about this movie was that with the exception of the title and the Character names, there was very little in common with the book. Bourne's whole reason for existing was deleted from the movie, and his true identity was remarkably reshaped.Not bad, but not terribly different from most other films of this genre."
3,"""A Good Movie for Matt Damon""","I was impressed that Matt Damon could do a good job with that role. He was actually pretty good. The movie is good , nice car chases and action. I would reccomend this movie for people who just want to be entertained , and not want to expect Oscar-worthy performances and such. I would wait till it comes out on DVD! Starring: Matt Damon , Franka Potente , Chris Cooper , Brian Cox and Clive Owen."
2,Boring and Predictable,"This spy movie is a total nonsense. The character appears in the middle of nowhere, with amnesia, knowing many languages and fighting like a ninja. He runs away from different people - everybody wants to kill him. This movie is a recipe for success - there is a good boy, a pretty girl, one romantic scene and lots of action - but it's so boring and predictable. For me, the worst part is the end. The effects are very good, but not enough to give support to a ludicrous story. I don't intend to see the sequel and I would suggest you do the same."
3,"Though not a masterpiece, a movie worth watching","The Bourne Identity brings to the screen the story of a young man dragged out of the Mediterranean Sea and without a clue as to who he is. His only lead is a bank account in Zurich. His problems, however, have only just begun...Matt Damon is amazing in his respective role though the rest of the cast fail to follow with the exception of lovely Julia Stiles who seems to have quite a bit of potential.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good, but nothing extraordinary.In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment."
4,The Bourne Identity a close 2nd to the book,"Great action guy flick. It reminded me of The Saint, however, Matt Damon has a greater range as an actor then Val Kilmer. Overall the story is fast paced and action packed. Also the chick in the movie is a POA"
3,The Bourne Identity.,This movie turned out fine. The movie arrived on time and had the extended features that were described in the product description.
2,decent action flick,"Bourne Identity is good if you like ""on the run"" type movies. The plot of this film seemed very similar to The Saint. If you have seen The Saint, you might be a little disapointed with the Bourne Identity."
5,Intelligent and Entertaining Spy Thriller,"At first I was a little iffy on having Matt Damon as an action star. He has a good look, but I felt that he was too good an actor for this part, however, he pulls it off with ease. This is a well paced and smart thriller that does not insult the audience's intelligence by just feasting our eyes on explosions (go see XXX instead). Franka Potente as his love interest is also good in this film. Car chases usually cause me to curl into a fetal position from sheer boredom, but the obligatory one in this movie is very exciting to watch. It makes me want to go out and buy a Mini Cooper. This movie is a must own. My one complaint is that the very beautiful and talented Julie Stiles is wasted in this movie."
4,A Good Action Movie,This was a fine action movie. The fight scenes were very good although at times you could tell that the film speed was advanced in order to make it look faster. It was also a theme that has been explored before (with Jackie Chan's 'Who Am I') with some success. With all that aside it was still an enjoyable movie. A movie about assassins and the CIA. About someone's personal struggle between good and evil and about a fledgling romance and wanting to be a better person. It was also about betrayal. This is a decent way to spend a few hours. Watch it and enjoy.
1,Spy Kids for grown-ups,Matt Damon is terrible. The cinematography is awful. The graphics are cheap. It's basically a movie version of CSI with a few more fight scenes.Terrible.
1,That sucked,"I watched the movie a week after I read the book, and that probably wasn't the best idea. The only part of the movie that follows the book is him waking up not knowing who he is, and having the number to the bank account in Zurich. That is where it ends. I tried to appreciate the movie as a movie, and not as an adaptation but I found it impossible and turned the movie off somewhere near the end. Not cool."
1,Based on what?!!!!,"The movie is awful. Boring. Plotless and the only thing that relates to the entire book is the title The Bourne Identity. The books that the movie is based on are three of the most cherished books in my library. 1st they do a really poor job of introducing the characters. It was not till the third installation that I finally learned the name of several of the characters.Let me just list off who is not in the movie (these are MAJOR characters in the book too!):Alexander Conklin - Jason Bourne's creator & friend.Moe Panov - Jason Bourne's doctor & friend.Carlos - Jason Bourne's nemesis, his equal.These three characters are NOT just paramount in the story line - they ARE the story line.I am certain that the screenwriters, directors and everyone else on board with this movie never read the books and only wanted to make a quick buck.A sad excuse for a good book. An absolute chaotic nightmare!"
2,Damon as an action hero...I think NOT!,"If anyone actually believed that Matt Damon would make a good action hero needs to have their head examined. If you look closely at the fight scenes, you can tell how awkward Damon looks at these shots. What was going through casting director Joseph Middleton's mind when they chose Matt Damon. I bought this DVD and deeply regret having done so! Don't make the same mistake."
2,Fun but...,"OK, here's the problem: I've read the book three times already,(and I know I'll read it again), so I can fairly say it's one of my favourites. I saw this film and I found almost nothing even similar to the book.If you did not read the book, the film is OK, entertaining and with LOTS of action, but if you are an old Jason Bourne fun like me, go grab your old paperback, relax and stick to the real J.B."
4,Action packed.,This movie has you leaning into all the twists and turns... very entertaining ...will watch the other 3 sequels next.
3,The Bourne Identity,"While there is a lot of action in this movie, it fails to live up to the expectations of those who enjoyed the fabulous book by Robert Ludlum. While movies based on novels often fall short, Harry Potter being an exception, this rendition of the novel ignores major plot points created in the book. That said, if you've never read the book, or can ignore the temptation to make comparisons to Ludlum's work, this is still an action movie that fans of that genre may enjoy."
3,Disappointing,"Why, I must ask, did the film producers bother to purchase the rights to Ludlum's novel if they weren't planning on using any of it? The movie retains only the slightest similarity to the original, far more complex and interesting, novel. I suspect I would have enjoyed this movie more if it hadn't pretended to be based on a novel I've read and enjoyed. It's good enough as a spy story, but it's not The Bourne Identity."
2,Wasted my time and money!,"This movie was not only unrealistic (scaling buildings, driving a car through oncoming traffic, and remaining unseen after changing only their hair color) but hard to follow as well. I was extremely disappointed with this movie. I was expecting a captivating espionage thriller with excellent, well thought out characters and a fast-paced plot. Viewers were left with unfinished turns in the movie and characters that were left unexplained. This wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, but it certainly wasn't the greatest. The best part about the entire movie was the scenes from around the world. The movie includes excellent shots from various different locations."
4,The Bourne Identity (HD-DVD),I'm a fan of the Jason Bourne movies. I wanted to add this great movie to my HD-DVD collection. I had an HD-DVD player before a Bluray and wanted a few of these HD-DVDs as these are now cheaper due to being obsolete.
4,Fast-paced Fun!,"High octane action and explosive performances power this vivid adaptation of the Robert Ludlum best-seller. As the titular secret agent on the run, Chamberlain lends courage and conviction to his signature role, while the sumptuous Smith supplies the glamour. For your money you get a pleasant transfer with decent picture and sound, but extras are thin at best. Highly recommended!"
4,"Love the movie, Don't like that it is a flipper",I was a little disappointed that this is a flipper disc. I would have been happier if it was just a Blu-ray with the cover art. I have the standard dvds and wanted blu-ray. The audio is outstanding on my HT. Great price so I can live with it.
1,Boring and Cumbersome,"I was disappointed with this movie. The movie is too long and I found it confusing. It was hard to focus on the plot while at the same time trying to figure out who all the characters were. At the same time, Damon as Jason makes some pretty stupid decisions. I just didn't buy any of it."
2,A Serious Miss.,"Any similarity between the book and this movie is purely accidental. In adapting the book to the screen the scriptwriters have stipped away all of the pacing and logic of the book, as well as a good deal of its intricacy. The characters become hollow and one dimensional.The only redeeming feature is that the actors do what they can with a lousy script."
1,Terrible acting,"Story is ok, but nothing original, and acting is bottom horrible. Damon has no personality whatsoever on screen."
3,Where's the book?,"The movie was good. The book was better. If you have read the book, the movie will seem completely different. Don't adjust your set, i *think* this is what they were going for. The movie left out some very important characters like Carlos, Andre' Villers, as well as the staff at Les Classiques, in fact that entire part of the plot. I suppose the book was proably too long to make into a movie exactly the same, but this is unacceptable. For gods sake, they don't even mention conklin's name during the entire film, only in the credits! I am sure, at least i hope that other fans of the book will agree that the movie and book were completly different entities. I will give the movie three stars, and the book five."
4,Go Bourne!,"The Bourne Identity is a great spy thriller starring Matt Damon as Jason Bourne! This filck may not be as clever as the book ,but hey I loved the car chase! The ending is predictable ,but it's an excellent movie!"
5,Great movie even greater on HD-DVD,I am a big fan of the Bourne movies. Seeing them in HD makes them even more enjoyable to watch. If you are Bourne fan you really need to check these movies out on HD-DVD. Can't wait for Ultimatum to come on HD-DVD.
3,Who is Bourne?,A great introduction to the series. I liked going in not knowing how the plot would turn out. I also liked how Bourne was much more vulnerable and less all-powerful at this point. Not unlike Neo (Keanu Reeves) in the first Matrix movie. Although I must say the damsel constantly in distress started to wear thin on me.Also look for Clive Owen barely recognizable as himself.
5,Classic!,"This movie is a classic! Everything about it, in my opinion, is great. From the acting, to the story, and the Christian overtones. I highly recommend it"
5,Must see for Engineers Architects and Artists,"This story about Michaelangelo contains a brief documentary introduction. It dramatizes most elegantly the trials of Michelangelo and of Pope Julius. It centers mostly around the painting of the Cisteen Chapel. It redefines what it means to be productive. The Medicii family history is in the background. A most important insight into art delivered by Rafael, the contemporary of Michaelangelo. This story needs to be viewed at least 3 times. Once for overview, once for context and insight, finally once for allowing yourself to fall into the story and really enjoy this great work about a great work and a great artist.I believe this would also be a good story to view with troubled teenagers and troubled adults who can't seem to find meaning in life."
1,agony or ecstasy,"ALONG TIME AGO I SAW THIS IN THE THEATER, AND FOUND IT INTERESTING HOW THE PAINTING OF THE CHAPEL WAS DONE. HOWEVER, IT WAS VERY SLOW MOVING, FOR A TEEN AGER. NOW THAT I'VE GROWN OLD, (63), I COULD HARDLY STAY FOCUSED ON IT AT ALL.IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN PURCHASING THIS MOVIE, I WARN YOU IT WILL BE PAINFULLY SLLLOOOOOWWWW. THINK OF IT AS ""THE AGONY NOT THE ECSTASY"". SORRY MR. HESTON, BUT ITS TRUE. I STILL THINK YOU'RE THE BEST.YOUR FRIEND, JEFF"
1,waste of time,"this was not a good movie when first released and it has not improved over time. the acting is stilted and over the top, the script poorly done and full of angst. Heston and Harrison are annoying enough when seen individually but are almost ridiculous when on screen together."
1,THE AGONY AND THE ECTASY,"WHEN I RECEIVED MY (1ST ORDER) IT WAS DEFECTIVE, SO I RETURNED AND REORDERED , THE 2ND COPY WAS ALSO DEFECTIVE, SO I GAVE UP, PISS POOR QUALITY AND I HAD TO PAY THE RETURN CHARGES.NEVER AGAIN."
1,Man for all Seasons,"This was my first encounter of buying on-line. It proved to be a costly lesson, that you don't buy DVD from out side your own country As I have 4 DVD that i Can't play.Br Robert Cottam"
2,"History, but not Mystery","As a fan of both history and mystery, I really wanted to like this book. Unfortunately, I was unable to find more than a small portion intriguing. In isolated sections, the prose is almost lyrical, and the details of this fascinating period in history are well done. However, the main characters are just plain unlikeable and descend into tediously melodramatic cardboard figures by the end of the novel. Not since the Duchess of Malfi has mass death been more appealing.Perhaps the morose nature of the plot would be bearable if there was a real mystery to solve, but anyone who is an avid mystery reader will recognize the real killer and motive by the end of the first chapter.Since audio listeners seem to be more favorable, it may be that Tim Curry really does have the power to entertain us no matter what the material. Pity there's no talent of that calibre to redeem the printed version."
3,PC - Sync DOSN'T WORK WITH WINDOWS NT!,...the pc - sync for the franklin organisers ONLY work with windows 95/98 and only ENGLISH! versions. Although the organiser supports many different languages.THIS UNITS DON'T WORK WITH WINDOWS NT!
5,"Tops for the job, just like Reagan","This was just what the doctor ordered. I was able to finagle the business and cajole my parents into leaving everything either to me alone or at least with my hooks in it. Seven children and seventeen grandchildren, all scheming and backbiting to get as much as possible and fritter it away. I had to get some sort of help to get me past the family values claptrap. I mean, how are you going to do your patriotic duty to the economy and keep estates intact and working for the profit of a few? What's the point of protecting inheritances from taxes if they're just going to be sawed up into a million pieces?"
2,Lacked a lot,It was really just a collection of very short essays and reports. It did not delve very deeply or have much umph to it.
5,It is a Great Item.,"We have a small business and this has come in handy on more than one occasion. It is a great product,"
4,Best Miss Marple ever!!!,"Geraldine McEwan is awesome as Miss Marple. I MUCH prefer her over Joan Hickson, who looks like she's about ready to fall over at any moment. Geraldine McEwan is spry, witty, tough, and looks like she can actually take on her enemies. I didn't like the Moving Finger, there was just too many adult issues and things like that. By the Pricking of my Thumbs is my favorite out of all Miss Marple's I have ever seen. It has suspense and has this sort of scary-movie sense to it without being terrifying. Those are actually the only two I've seen from this set, and from McEwan,(they came on PBS) but she makes it so much better than Hickson that I would give this 5 stars if not for the Moving Finger."
2,Out of Place,"Agatha Christie fans be forewarned: the screenwriters have plunked Miss Marple down in the middle of a Tommie and Tuppence story in this series. Did they think we would not notice that they have changed story lines on us?I loved Dame Christie's original stories; it did me no good to throw in good actors and costuming, I couldn't get past the warping of the tales."
5,Fun to have,"Tiny Tim sings songs from the forgotten past and did it with style and class.Close to a 35 minute set , 14 songs with a secret track at the end."
3,"Some terrific animation, but...","The live action segments connecting the animated shorts are tediously long and full of mean, unfunny humour. We eventually decided they were unwatchable and started skipping over them. I almost purchased this thing based on recommendations, but I'm glad I found a rental copy first. I suggest you do the same."
2,Too small,"I usually buy a 7-1/8 cap. This ""large"" cap is too tight. I should have bought an adjustable cap."
5,REISSUE NOW AVAILABLE AGAIN,"With a new cover, newly mastered and a full booklet THE RIVER has been reissued! I lost my CD and found the reissue recently on Amazon!THE RIVER (Sounds of Nature Series)There is also a version with musicRIVER OF LIFE (Tranquility Series)I happen to like water themes, they are so relaxing. I can also recommendOCEAN WAVES (Sounds of Nature Series)orA WALK AT THE BEACH (Sounds of Nature Series)as well asBUBBLING CREEK (Sounds of Nature Series)or the version with music which is one of my favoritesZEN GARDEN (Tranquility Series)"
5,Virgin Forest,-Just a great recording with lots of dynamics(very musical)and all of the musicians have lots to say. The album is very much like a story with many interesting characters and plot twists. Plus it often Grooves-especially the title song.
5,Great old songs by Marty Robbins,I used to have this album many years ago and lost it. What a treat to be able to listen to these great songs again!
3,Not enough Umph!,"Although I enjoyed reading TMOAGT, I thought Ms. Roby could have had more flava to her writing. It was almost like she held back, and gave more along the lines of a step by step guide of the plot...but it was for the most a take-my-time-read because I already knew where it was going...too predictable. I didn't race through it like CTFS perhaps because that was my first introduction to greedy Pastor Curtis Black."
4,Great read that's full of action.,"Too Much of A Good Thing is Kimberla Lawson Roby's finest novel to date. Nicely paced and well-plotted, the storyline continues to follow the antics of Pastor Curtis Black who is now married to Mariah. Curtis's new wife is happy, even though she's disappointed that Alicia, her teenage step-daughter, won't open up to her.The happy marriage faces many challenges when Curtis Black wants to head Truth Missionary Baptist Church. Church business and other commitments weigh on Mariah's mind, and the choices made by Pastor Black threaten to uproot everything important to him.Roby's fan will have a great time catching up with Curtis. Too Much of A Good Thing is humorous, emotional, and eye-opening; the only question you may have at the end of the book is Curtis's motivations for the questionable decisions he makes.Roby shines in her latest novel and the book is highly recommended."
3,3 star performance...Good but not her best!,"Ms. Roby is a good writer, but I am not sure if she is trying too hard to stay a float in this writing game. TMOAGT was by far her weakest story yet. Let's be real.The dialogue...was...um shall I say straight up wack! Mariah and her mother talking flashed back to Beyonce trying to form a coherent sentence! Lordy, lord. Curtis Black should have paid a much higher price and blood should have been on his hands literally...I fear there will be a follow on (I pray not) because there is no way Charlotte's father can go from being mad as HELL to supportive...no way!!! Overall, I was quite disappointed as I was expecting to live the story, not predict it. Kim, please take a hiatus and put substance back into your craft...and no more Curtis Black!"
4,"Umm, um, um",Now Curtis Black is a handful and I like reading about him. The author gives this character traits and situations that make you say---I gotta watch out for my man or is my man Curtis Black. A very nice read.
4,Surprisingly entertaining,I didn't really have any opinion on the movie before I actually started watching it but it suprisingly drew me in. Treasure Island was a book that I loved reading over and over as a child and this movie just brought back that feeling of adventure and suspense and exotic locales. The animation was very well done and the story pretty well crafted with enough surprises that it kept you engaged.I would highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys animated movies as well as kids of all ages.
5,You can lose your eyelashes it's so great!,"Okay, okay. I lied about losing your eyelashes when you see a good movie. But to me, this movie was packed with action and hope. It teaches little children to not give up on your adventures and dreams. Also, it gets kids to read the book ""Treasure Planet"" is based on, ""Treasure Island"". I say it's a perfectly good movie. And if Jim Hawkins were real I'd freak out! Hee hee! Well, that's it. I hope for the people who hate this movie understand how the movie is good to my point of view."
3,Noteworthy for its vocal casting!,"Disney bastardized its earlier classic ""Flubber"" with the pathetic remake, so, I suppose the company tried to do the same with this updated reworking of the Stevenson classic that the studio had so superbly adapted in the 1950's. ""Treasure Planet"", while boasting some magnificent animation, doesn't hold the interest of those beyond the age of 10. It's almost like watching an offshoot of ""Titan, A.E"", taking place in a parallel timeline.Great casting of the actors providing the voices is the film's only saving grace. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brian Murray, Emma Thompson, the great Patrick McGoohan, the distinctive Roscoe Lee Browne, and the always-dependable Tony Jay as ""the narrator"" bring life to routine storytelling."
2,What's up with Disney?,Once again Disney disappionts me by making yet another action film to target young boys. And in the proccess making a movie with no heart I could care less about the relationship between that 17 year old and Captian Long John Silver or whatever they called him. Why can't Disney come up with more orginal stuff like Lilo and Stich that movie was halrious! The future for tradional animation is looking darker and darker. Hopefully Home On The Range will brighten things up but not likely.
2,Meltdown,"You let all the fat aliens die (except for Meltdown)! How could you? Snuff, Hands and Meltdown are my favorite characters!All of them should have lived. Why not kill Onus, Bird Brain, Oxy and Moron instead? If you'd do that, it would save my belly from losing another 4 stone."
1,Product is extremely limited,"The Eye Module is very limited in it's use and capabilities. It is a cool concept...taking pictures with your Visor and I was taking pictures within seconds of opening the package. However, the pictures are blurry and very small when viewed on the PC. Enlarging the pictures to a useful size results in a grainy, poor quality image. It's a fixed focus lense that requires a lot of light to capture an image. This product is a great idea and is very easy to use, but overall it falls short of being useful and is definitely not worth [the money]."
1,eyemodule disappoints,"The eyemodule is a great idea, poorly executed. I had hoped to use it as a handy jpeg capture device for web applications, but even at the maximum file size of 187K, images are fuzzy and of little use."
1,Unreadable Version,"This review is specifically for the Kindle Version of this book. While I have this book in a paperback and had enjoyed it, the formatting on the Kindle download is so totally screwed up that it borders on unreadable. Specifically, everything is left justified with no paragraph indents. Indeed, I slogged through about 10 pages or so in the hopes that it was just a glitch with a page or two before it became apparent that the entire book had this problem (and spot checking proved it so.) Downloading again, this time to my computer instead of wireless, resulted in the same problem, so it's rather obvious it's not been formatted correctly."
4,Super Reader,"Brain Wave describes what happens when an astromonical phenomenon passes Earth, and elevates the intelligence of a sizable proportion of the planet's population.This causes plenty of changes, as super geniuses have to keep busy and keep from getting bored, somehow."
5,Great service,"I ordered this watch from overseas, had it shipped to an address in the US. Overnight delivery, accepted international credit card - Perfect service and goods arrived within 24 hrs from ordering.Watch in perfect condition."
1,Poor quality and terrible customer service - regretting this purchase!,"I'm not sure if this is exactly the one I bought - but it is similar. I also bought the Gaggia espresso machine. The grinder worked fine for the first 10 months or so. Then it started smoking one day and stopped working. The warranty clearly states that the product has a 2yr warranty and instructed me to send it to Gaggia repair center, which I did. They sent it back saying they do not repair grinders. Then Gaggia Milan told me the product only has a 1 year warranty and therefore it was no longer under warranty, even though I have the warranty details which clearly state it is a 2yr warranty. I can send it to them for repair but I have to pay for shipping (to Milan!). This is a poor product manufactured by company with no concept of customer service. I wish I had bought the Nespresso machine instead."
3,Out on the Farm,"I had purchased ""Farm Life"" by Magic Moods and was disappointed in the types of sounds recorded. Although the 'Sounds of Nature"" series are not the best in environmental sound experiences, I liked this item. This album sounds just like a mountain farm or ranch should. This is not the first cd I would reach for when it comes to relaxation time, but it is a nice alternative when you have heard enough ocean, rain, birds and thunder sounds for a while."
5,Simply Incredible,"Okay, the cd is so incredible, it is easily one of the best in my collection. Some have written this off as a cheap rip off of such bands as Theatre of Tragedy or Tristania, but if you listen, there is much more talent than Theater, and Tristania recently is more industrial goth sounding. For example, Theater of Tragedy does no double bass drumming, but in some tracks on Perpetual Desolation the double bass ranks with Satyricon as far as speed(if you dont know what im talking about, listen to ""A Tormented Soul""). If you havent heard the music I would reccomend going to the bands... and listening to the samples there. The Sins of Thy Beloved are extremely talented but go about showing there talent in a very delectable and beautiful manner. The only band that i would consider better is Opeth, for obvious reasons. If you are a conniseur of goth metal or just curious about it, this is a great cd to buy, it is sorrowful and beautiful goth at its finest.Absolutely fantastic."
5,A heart wrenching tale of life in the early history of our nation.,Every day I thank the good Lord that I was not a part of those trying and desolate times as our nation was coming into its own. What a rough and rugged life these people led. This is a heart rending tale of a couple of 'pioneers' who literally carved out a place of their own in the wilderness. A great tale of the endurance of our forefathers and mothers in the early years of our country. A great read dramatically told and probably as true to life as possible.
2,Lamb in his BBBOOORRRIIIING,The author writes in such a slow pace that ends up boring his readers to death. The story line is interresting but way to drawn out.
4,"I love Patti, but...","Regarding this book, my main gripe with Patti is that she edited some of the poems from Seventh Heaven so that they're missing the lesbian erotic content. This change seems both deceptive and cowardly, and I think Patti needs to have her [...] kicked for it."
1,Awfully slow read,"The Bank of Fear is an awfully slow and unbelievable read. The premise rests on a dirty Arab businessman who runs a hundreds of shell companies for the Iraqi ruler. Alas, the ruler is assassinated so there is a scramble for the ruler's riches."
5,Excellent and fun,"Unlike so much of the software for kids, this is well-constructed, with an interesting and usable user interface, and challenging problems. I have a pretty bright seven-year-old, and she loves this one.BTW, anyone who finds logic-based software like this of interest for their kids should check out Squeak, a programming language developed for kids by Alan Kay (who invented a good bit of modern computing). It's available for free on the Net."
2,Frustrating,"We have had this game for a while, and bought it because of the many reviews. However, my daughter and I find it extremely frustrating. Even when we know what the task is to be done, we often cannot figure out how to do it. The math puzzles, when we come across them, are fine, but most of the time is spent figuring out where to click for something. This game is very linear, so if you can't figure one thing out, there's no way to move to another task where you might eventually better understand the gestalt of the game. You just sit there, with Mia tapping her foot, repeating the same clue again and again and again and again and again. The help at kutoka.com was good to find, but it wasn't sufficient to solve the problem.Even with the parts we have played, I don't find it terribly compelling."
2,Waste of time,I bought this for my son (6) and daughter (8).The program is very interactive but you will waste countless hours just wandering around Mia's world. If you spend 1 hour playing it you will really only spend about 10 minutes really learning anything useful. It is extremely frustrating to figure out how to get from place to place. The designers obviously built this program to show off their skills but failed to really make it a productive use of time.Bottom line. Don't waste your money on this. Many other programs are also very fun and challenging and don't waste your time wandering aimlessly around...
5,Fun and Educational,"This educational software helps me sneak in some math drills into my daughters' day. It is definitely supposed to feel like they are just playing a game, and my girls play it without me having to tell them to give a try."
5,"Pretty much as close as film can come, to the real deal.","The festival is not really film able, the Kumba Mele comes before and outlasted film. Can't CGI either, but this film comes as close as I've seen to on the festival, that allows you to gain some scope and heart. Five stars is a lot, still, I've watched 10 or more documentaries on the Mele and this one works the best by far."
3,a pretty good debut...,"this cd is defintitely not one of the best i own but it is a good debut for the group n for young jeezy. it's easy to see that he is one of the best rappers in the group from the start but for a group they do well. most of the songs have the young jeezy feel to them and remind me a lot of his cd. but some are a lil bit wack. overall, it was an excellent debut for jeezy and if u like listening to his music u will enjoy this preview of the beginning of his rap career."
4,Hos S**T,"This album his hot ass hell Jeezy, Duke, Gee & Jody all spit hot fire. It's about time Puff Daddy finds some good talent it's a good thing there backed up by Block Ent. because Puff let's his artist make one album then drop you, but all together it's worth buying"
5,The NWA of the South,This was one of the albums that I was waiting to be dropped for the year and they definitely disappoint me on this one. This is the hardest group to ever come out of the South by far and they are from my home state so I had to buy it once it came out. This whole cd is ridiculous and every track on there is a banger. If you love the south and rap period you should definitely pick this cd up
5,SO HOTT,this album is hott!!! the sample that i heard from boys n da hood's c.d. had me bumpin' in my seat!!! Evrybody should go out and get it tomorrow..best believe i'll be at the store as soon as it comes out!!!
1,Why do you support these Fool's,"Trash, and irrated plus the good albums ya'll give them 0's.so now I'ma let the world know."
5,Beginning to End,"While listening to this CD all I could think about was how I hadn't listened to a CD from begining to end in a long time. Well that wait is over! With the exception of Diddy's annoying talking on the intro this complete joint is CLASSIC. I mean the south has never really been off the map, just slept on a little bit, but these boyz really are showing people the south is here to stay. I was skeptical at first but once I listened to it I was sold. Even the track with Easy E, which I thought was going to be another garbage song using someone who died vocals, was off the chain. DEM BOYZ REALLY GOT WORK!!! SCOOP THIS DISC UP YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!"
3,I was thinkin about buyin this album but........,"all theese BS reviews completely turn me offex: Quote from Jody Breeze Luva""OMG! I just bought Boyz N Da Hood cd and I can EASILY say that this cd is the best cd in my whole collection. Nobody's cd can compare to theirs. They have the best cd in the world.""and i listened to it at my friends houseand its not anything different. Im not a south h8er either. Ludacris and lil john are way better than them. I gave it a 3 to be fair because i dont have he album and it not horribleIf u want ACTUAL classics buyKanye West: College DropoutThe Game: The DocumentaryCommon: Be50 Cent: Get Rich Or Die Tryin'2pac: Greatest Hits(and most of his other albums)Notorious B.I.G: Ready 2 Die and Life After DeathI know the 1st couple barely compare to the last couple( Biggie and 2pac) but the rest r more modern day classics."
5,A quirky and hilarious look at the young Lando Calrissian,"Lando has just one the Millenium Falcon in a card game and, against his will, also finds himself the owner of a brand new droid named Vuffi Raa. Their adventure is strange and confusing, but highly entertaining. The mystery of an ancient and highly intelligent race of beings who leave no trace of their existance except giant and impenetrable monuments has only one clue. Guess who gets to play detective."
3,Just doesn't quite cut the cheese,"The reason for 3 stars is the sound quality. It bites really. It doesn't do Deceased any justice to their music! The music rips and is friggin' awesome... but the production is lacking and makes this album 3 stars. I have Fearless Undead Machines and the clarity of that compared with this is like a kick in the teeth. After listening to one of Deceased's clearer albums (with better clarity) and then listening to 13 Frightened Souls... its a dissapointment. But that doesn't stop the music from being sweet as, it just clouds it and makes it less obvious :-( If you're a Deceased fan, go ahead get it. But if you're just starting to get into Death Metal or Deceased, then try for a more recent Deceased album or summin'."
2,Horrible Material,"I agree with another reviewer that the bristles are a bit too soft. The dust pan itself it made of a plastic that holds a lot of static. Because of this, when I try to empty the dirt out of the pan there is a lot of dirt that remains in the pan. Would not buy again."

5,Review,"I received the book in few days and in good condition. In my opinion, you can trust this seller."
5,This music will kill your parents before you can (indeed! ),"Talk about insanity &psychotic lirycs huh ?Some times i wonder if they let the menbers of a.c out of an mental hospital (laughs)!!Anywho, the music here is beyond what any one can stand and its more extremy then i dont know what realy...I assumed if your a fan of cephalic carnage, aborted, &,napalm death then you'll love this album !buy it!"
2,The band's name says it all,"I got this CD as a gag birthday gift in 1993. It is endlessly funny that this thing got made, much less reissued in 1998. The few intelligible words appearing on the disc will stay with you, but for all the wrong reasons."
1,"not item in picture,","dissapointed, picture showed item same as one being replaced.received item was not the pictured stapler."
4,The Serial Killer Sub-plot,"The serial killer is inserted, not thrown in, as a means to ""say"" more about Bill Pullman's character's capabilities. These hint at aspects of this fellow others will ingore as the film moves on- I'll not comment on the consequences of their oversights."
4,let me rack my brain for a clever retort...,"There are other candidates for best line besides ""I AM God."" My favorite is ""Welcome to the game."""
5,Christmas keeper,"I collect Christmas movies and this one is definitely a keeper. It is clean, fun, not predictable, and Christmas-sy. It makes me want to change the way I do Christmas next year - more like this movie and less about the presents under my family's tree. Wonderful movie."
5,Great Family Movie,I really enjoyed this movie. It actually moved me past inspiration to action to give and make even more of a difference with my life than I have been making. Takes the focus and puts it onto what can you do for others.Very heart warming and a real catalyst subconsciously. :) Enjoy your life.
3,not the best christmas movie,"it was a cute story, acting was ok, but nothing spectacular. I guess measuring everything against ""it is a wonderful life"" all come too short for me. I was looking for a good Christmas movie, but again, this was just ok. Watch ""The Christmas shoes"" if in the mood for Christmas movie"
5,Nice Movie,"I thought it was a great movie. There were some sad moments, but overall very worthwhile. I would recommend seeing it."
5,Anthony N,"How good is this book?Well, let me put it this way. If you could only have ONE book on martial arts, this is the book to buy. It is a huge (over 1,000 pages) book that covers a lot of areas, and even though I am not a Hapkido exponent (I have 2 decades of reality based fighting systems - primarily Krav Maga, Arnis and JKD), this was definitely a very interesting book for me.Once again, if you could only have one book on fighting systems/martial arts, this is the book to have. I honestly have not seen anything that comes close to it.It is simply amazing and worth every single red penny."
5,Great overview book,"This book is really a great overview of Hapkido. Just don't expect to learn the art just from reading it! Also remember this is not ""traditional"" or ""purely korean"" Hapkido - a seasoned practicioner will see influences from many other, ""modern"" martial arts - like taekwondo and wing chun for example, so i like to refer to it as ""modern"" Hapkido. This is not bad, just remember this when buying the book.I personally think, that the interviews section could be omited, or sold as a solo book.Also, some of the photographs have a slightly distorted art/information ratio, but this was to be expected as the author is a professional photographer ;) But this also shows in the overall quality of pictures - they are beautifull and (most of them) very informative!Overall - this is a VERY good book if You want a VERY good overview of Hapkido. And if You're ready for a LONG read (over 1000 pages!) ;)"
1,"E for Effort, D for content","Excellent design and photos, indeed much work went into this book.Many of the techniques are a joke.Missing chapters on one of the most famous and respected Grandmaster's, the Late Myong Jae Nam (Jae Nam Myong) and his VERY important style of Hapkido which is simply not acceptable.Lack of cicular techniques. Poor research."
1,4000 photos of white belt jujitsu techniques,The book is a waste of time and space. Hapkido is supposed to derive from aikijujutsu and all this book has is basic jujitsu. I looked at the standing grappling/grappling section (400 pages). Its about 4000 photos of white belt techniques. If a 130 pound girl was forced to fight a 225 lb. heavyweight cage fighter and the girl asked me for a good book to read I would not recemmend Tedeschi's book. I think Tedeschi must spar with one-armed old ladies--- thats about all his book will prepare you for. I don't know about the striking section of the book so I can't comment on that. Check out Jwing-Ming Yang's Chin Na books for the advanced locking techniques. I would recommend his chin na books to that girl I wrote about above (I was actually thinking about Whitney Houston vs. Mike Tyson).
4,like it,I like it wasn't too hard to do. I am a beginner. Love the music however the Price was a little high.
1,Winsome Wood Black Coffee Table,"The coffee table arrived on time, but about two months after owning it, a crack started to occur on the table top. It's been about 9 months since receiving the item, and now there is a very large, visible crack on the table that seems to be getting worse. I will not be purchasing any more items from this line of furniture."
3,Really like,"The table came to us fine, with no nicks or scratches at all. It's the perfect size for a not large living room, which is what we have. The kids have scratched it up a little however it doesn't show as much because it's black."
2,Not worth $143.00,Table was easy to assemble using extended screwdriver with socket. The hardware and the black finish is cheap. The front edge finish was bubbled and scratched. Its a very small table so beware... go to Ikea get a much better deal spending $99.
1,my coffee table,"arrived with crack on wood, cannot see when assembled, top surface bumpy looks cheap, bottom shelf does not allign. Over all was way to expensive for how it looks, local store has same table for $100 less. Looks okay, but not for $250 , I would expect a nicer piece, would have bought the matching hall table , but not now, will buy from local store"
4,Cute little table!,Purchased this item for my daughter & son-in-law and they liked it. It's a light weight piece of furniture & it seemed to fit their decor.
4,GREAT BOOK!,"MERHABA, THIS IS A GREAT BOOK, IT TEACHES YOU ALL THE BASICS ABOUT TURKISH, I RECOMMEND GETTING ALSO THE LONELY PLANET TURKISH PHRASEBOOK, 1999, BY JIM MASTERS AND TOM BROSNAHAN, COK GUZEL, HOSCA KALIN!"
3,Polarized Lens,"I am not 100% happy with this purchase. My understanding was that the lens was supposed to make the colors vivid. What I found was that while some colors were enhanced, the overall photo was dark."
5,Macbeth,"If you are in a hurry to complete your report, it will help you so. But don't forget to read the entire book as soon as you can."
2,Microphone not working,Purchased this item at Christmas the video works great but can't get the built in microphone to work. Been in contact with Logitech support several times but none of their suggestions seem to solve the problem.I'm using a Microsoft Ergonomic 4000 keyboard and they're suggestion was to uninstall the software. The reason was that the volume on the keyboard could cause the problem but this still didn't solve anything.Even went as far as downloading the software off their website and doing a clean install. Did this three different times using three different USB ports and this still didn't work.Now waiting for next response from Logitech.
1,This thing is unusable and amazon charged 20% to return,what a lousy design. I expected this to be the same size as the quick cam fusion.It is nothing like it and huge. The pictures display pictures on Amazon are not scaled. This model is twice as big. The support brace will not hold it on anything but a flat surface. Isn't usable on a lcd flat screen or laptop.I returned it to Amazon. They charged me a 20% restocking fee.Won't be using Amazon any more.
4,Does what needs to be done,I got excellent feedback when using this unit on SKYPE. Auto features for light and echo make video conferencing quite easy. The unit also can record an HD version of Windows Media video as well as large still images when not used for live conferencing. There is a privacy feature that displays a still image rather than live video if you don't want to be seen on camera. I hope this feature is improved and designed to be used as a slide show presentation. I've been looking for this feature for a long time. During a live video conference I've often wanted to show recently taken digital photos while chatting. This feature lets you go to a folder on your computer and display images in place of your live video as you talk. I love this feature if they would only improve the resolution of the image displayed at the distant end. The camera turned out to be a bit larger than I expected but it performs exceptionally well.
2,Bad,I ordered the third edition and was sent the second edition. Material is pretty much the same but the examples are different so i can't use my book for class.
3,The Scorpion King,Not what I expected from the previous Mummy movies and The Rock's promos on History Channel. For some reason the writers moved the story from Egypt to Palestine. Ignoring what is currently believed about the Scorpion King and what he may have actually been involved in. For a mindless 90 minute romp with fighting and swashbuckling it was pretty decent. Don't look at this as a prequel to the Mummy movies it does not fit.
3,Hollywood...,"I know it sounds weird but Akkadian language appeared in my dream. I started researching about this culture. There is not much on the web nor from architecture professors, but there is this movie... hence I rented it. Although I enjoyed this movie, I am disappointed that the whole setting is elaborate but generic. I don't watch action movies often... so I would compare it to Mel Gibson's Braveheart for the discussion. I love Braveheart much more because there is much more to the storyline and to the culture that it refers to. Scorpion King, on the other hand --can be a bunch of Vikings fighting, a bunch of Egyptians fighting, a bunch of Romans fighting, a bunch of cowboys fighting --it makes not much different except for the scene setting."
3,The Legend?,"This was a B movie with some interesting references. I remember the TV adcvertisements when the movie was first released -- The LEGEND of The Scorpion King. Well, there were quite a few legends that rated mention through the characters of the movie. We have Mnemnon of the Greeks, Mattithias of the Hebrews, Seth of both Hebrew and Egyptian legend, Isis of the Egyptians, Acadians and a ziggurat of the city of Ur, and a few others. If you have some background in ancient legend, the first mention of one name and you start listening for others. Also deserving of mention is that the city that the Scorpion King takes is Gamorrah of Hebrew legend -- with the mention of Sodom as a rival city. I can't say much more about the plot."
2,Low expectations,"Rumors abound that the first cut off this movie came in at only 70 minutes, and that a substantial amount of reshoots were needed to stretch the film out. If true, someone dropped that ball badly, and may have messed up what could have been a killer summer movie. Hope the rumors are only just rumors."
2,"I Could Smell it, alright.","...a lousy movie. The movie was so cliched, the acting was barely fair, and the script was nonexistant ... The camel was seriously the most interesting character in the entire film. I also couldn't buy into the guy with the achy-breaky hairdoo as a credible villain.I usually like cheesy fantasy movies, but this one took itself too seriously to be worthwhile for campiness.Don't waste your time with this tripe... Get Army of Darkness instead. It's just as anachronistic, but tongue-in-cheek enough to be worth it..."
1,Rocks don't talk,"I have to cover my eyes whenever a movie like this comes out. There are so many wonderful movies being made out there and yet people will flock to this one because a WWF wrestler is the star. His acting on that should tell people he cannot carry an entire movie. And he proves that in this. ""The Scorpion King"", stupid title, is filled with terrible acting, cheap fighting, and cartoony special effects. It looks like an episode of ""Xena Warrior Princess."" I would like to beg of The Rock to please stop making movies! Do what ever other wrestler does and run for governor."
1,"Scorpion King, what a flop","Terrible acting; Hum drum plot that really just follows the general guildlines of the standard conquerer movie. Really [bad] special effects. Basically just an extremely boring movie, with tiny humerous points which are a desperate attempt to liven it up. Plus, where is the great relation which makes him the Scorpion King? Nothing special, he just gets stuck with an arrow with a little bit of scorpion venom on it and doesn't die. WHOOOPYY! What is really funny is the music video by Godsmack has better computer animation than the movie itself. Even in the music video the Rock forms out of scorpions and then dissolves back into scorpions which didn't even happen in the movie. What a let down.Heck I would recommend Panic Room over this movie, and my girlfriend and I left during the middle of that one.Your time is valuable.Better options lay elsewhere!"
2,"Girls, don't even bother...","This movie was blatently and tastelessly aimed at the male genitalia and ego, and although I had the suspicious it would be so, I didn't think it would get as bad as it did. I should have ran away when the Rock first made his grand entrance by scaring off a whole building of people by whispering ""boo."" The main characters were very attractive (both the Rock and the sorceress), but take my word for it, it's the kind of movie to rent (when it is no longer a new release), and only when there is nothing else to rent. And whatever you do, don't think for a second this is going to be anything like Mummy and the Mummy Returns."
3,An Excellent Adventure,"This movie was a fun, wild ride from start to finish! Take it for what it is and you'll have a blast! Get to analytical and it will fail you. My advice, just have fun and let it take you on an action adventure and you'll have a great time!!!"
1,"My eyes, my eyes!!","I was thinking this film would be on par with The Mummy and The Mummy Returns but not only was it no where near the same in special effects, but it's absolutely horrible in every respect.The acting stunk, the sets were small like an episode of Xena, the special effects were nearly non-existent, and it was horribly boring. Conan the Barbarian from 20 years ago was far better than this piece of trash.The Rock has the body for this kind of film but his acting talents and his charisma are disappointingly tragic.This film had the set-up and the plotline to be a fantastic fantasy film but the producers decided to simply milk the connection between this movie and The Mummy Returns (kinda the way the producers milked Aliens 3 from Aliens 2) and spent nothing in terms of sets and special effects.Please, people, don't waste a single second watching this total letdown."
4,Excellent Sword - Action movie.,"Waste of time?! Not! That was the opinion of one reviewer and I disagree. This is a fun ancient-times action - sword movie. Born of the MUMMY duology, the Rock delivers a strong performance in his fight against a powerful, well crafted opponent. This movie is to much fun to be a waste of time. As my 8 year old son always, there are two things that make a movie great: Swords. Sword Fighting. there you go! This movie is also reasonably family friendly, as we don't recall any Spurting blood, nudity or simulated sex."
3,"Not as good as The Mummy, but still...","The Scorpion King boils down to one thing...fights. Lots and lots of fights. And while The Rock does a nice job as Mathyas (aka The Scorpion King), he does need the support of the actors around him. The movie does, however, give viwers the chance to see who the Scorpion King was prior to selling his soul to Anubis in The Mummy Returns. The story is decent, and the type of comedy that prevailed throughout the two previous Mummy movies is present here as well. The movie also left itself wide open for a sequel, so more Mathyas is probably on its way."
3,"Slightly surpasses mediocre, I guess.","The plot is utterly formulaic, and ""The Rock"" has all the acting ability of a cinder block, but this movie isn't totally boring."
2,The Rock cooks up a STINKER! Blu ray review,"Campy Conan in Egypt? This movie is a total disappointment. I understand their is plenty of camp in the Mummy series. However, it seems to be just the right amount. This is a non stop camp fest, with the Rock cooking up a stinker! The problem begins with the way the Scorpion King was set up in the Mummy Returns. That story called him a fierce and ruthless conquerer who made a deal with the devil. Well, this doesn't seem like the same guy. The story is goofy and filled with cheesy lines and sub par acting. The movie does have it's good points, such as the action sequences and beautiful cinematography. Worth a viewing.BLU RAY THOUGHTS: A sharp looking disc with great audio. Universal has done better though. Missing special features from DVD. FINAL THOUGHTS: NOT UPGRADE WORTHY"
2,Ha ha ha ha ha.....oh wait...it's not a comedy. Or is it?,"When I go to see a movie with assasins, barbarians, swords, arrows and man-eating ants, I don't want to see a COMEDY. Well, that's what this is. So if you go to this movie expecting another version of The Mummy Returns, then you probably wont be too disappionted. The problem with this movie is that it's too safe. There's no suspense or mystery with this movie. It's boring and predictable. It has a worthless script and is filled with cliches. I suppose it's the equivalent of watching a wrestling match from the WWF."
1,The Scorpion King.,"This [stinks]. Don't get it...Rated PG-13 for Language, Sexuality, and Action ViolenceRunning Time: 94 Minutes"
5,A real must have album,"I love this band, old and new.80s soundscapes and BM/death metal, what more do you need?This album is great if you like Privilege"
3,Ok To sport your team,"I bought this at the beginning of the 2011 football season to support my team, when i got it though the blue finish had a few bubbles in the enamel and a few mar marks but can't be seen from afar and the loins mane is crazy sharp and sticks into my stomich when i sit, I wouldn't get it again but i do wear it to support my team"
4,the meaning of colored smoke,"Are you caught up in trying to understand yourcontext and meaning? Sometimes it seems the pointis that living is more important than knowing everything.Enjoying life is more than just the grind of existence.Not everybody can find a beautiful girl who loves yourintellect, but we all love that Bickford Smeckler did..."
3,a massive letdown,"I would not recommend that you read the ""Riverworld"" series. Or at least, if you do, only read the first three books.This is because the evanescent wonder and joy of the first couple of volumes gives way to the enduring rage and disappointment of the final two.Without giving away too much, I will say that the explanations you're given for the ""big mystery"" will prove infuriating (to say the least) since the questions you want answered are not answered in any satisfying way, and many more questions arise for which there are no answers forthcoming.The whole time I was reading it, I kept thinking, ""Goodness! This is delightful! But there's got to be one heck of an explanation waiting for me down the road.""But there wasn't. Arrrghghghgh."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Not your dad's science fiction.Farmer shows his love of throwing strange casts of characters together in this novel, where those who die wake up on the Riverworld - which as you might guess, has a really long river. This is not just dead people, or dead famous people, it includes an alien, as well. Nazis, famous adventures and more, in a strange quest to work out what is going on."
5,A Truly Creative Work,I loved this book which combines wildly creative ideas with a great adventure story. A highly thought provoking work from a terrific science fiction pioneer.
4,Beginners,As a catholic I learned things from this book surprisingly. Was a good overview for my non-catholic husband. Helped him understand alot about my religion.
5,Catholicism for Dummies,bought as a gift. The person just love the book has thanked me several times.
5,An excellent introduction,"This book sealed the deal for me. It dispelled a lot of anti-Catholic garbage that I had heard over the years and taught me to pray the Rosary. I joined the Church soon after reading it.It is clear, concise and informative."
5,Helpful Book,Catholicism for Dummies provides a good understanding of Catholicism. It is easy to read and understand and provides an in-depth knowledge of all things Catholic. Our Church is using this book to teach Catholicism to adults wanting to join the Church.
4,Spirit of the 80's,"Although I thought that Working Class Dog was a better album, I thought that Success was a wonderful follow-up. And let's be real here, Rick was not trying to win an Oscar with either of the albums. The 80's were a fun time and the songs reflected that - the lyrics didn't always make sense, but boy they sold the records! I can think of a lot worse lyrics that any of the songs that are on this album. When I listen to it, it takes me right back to high school. :) Thanks, Rick."
4,Typical 1982 Album,"Guess what is my #1 favorite? Not What Kind Of Fool Am I, nor Don't Talk To Strangers which became huge hits in the US.I really like Kristina it really rocks!! But even Rick has not yet escaped the trend of 1982. Dance Pop yielded to hard rock. Rick has secured his positon between hard melodic pop rock bands (such as Styx, Boston, Journey and Survivor)and blues or country flavored rockers (such as John Cougar Mellemcamp, Bruce Springsteen and Bob Segar and The Silver Bullet Band).The album is nearly as enjoyable as Working Class Dog."
4,Love Sally Hansen products!,"Sally Hansen makes the best products for nails. This product was received before EDD and I use it twice a week, so I will be ordering again!"
2,Doesn't Do Everything It Says,"It's decent as a base coat, but this brand also has base coats that work better and provide other benefits such as strengthening your nails or making them grow faster. I'd recommend other base coats from this brand, just not this one. It doesn't seem to dry hard enough to work as a top coat either. Buying separate base and top coats would more than be worth the extra effort."
2,Yuck - Get their eponymous debut instead,"I'm from New England and have dug these guys for awhile, and their first disc is among my faves. But - and I hate to say it - this record bores me. It lacks fire and punch. It sounds like an uninspired Mike Ness solo record. I don't know if it's the production or the new guitar player or the cliched lyrics or what, but this is just too smooth, like the Rev's last few attempts. I think they're still a great live band, but stuff like the hook on ""Chop Shop"" is just plain cheezy and the disc sounds like so many other neo-rockabilly bands, whereas they really used to have a harder, more distinctive sound."
2,"title and cover great, but contents unsatisfying","this book seemed like a good idea when i bought it. but after living with it a while i feel there must be better prose poem collections out there. about half the book--up to robert bly, say--name-checks the hoary old classic, mostly european, proponents of the genre. i say name-checks because only a couple of works by each poet is included. the book justifies its price with a comfortable type size, generous margins, usually one poem per page--but the result of the consequent stingy sampling is that one tends to read through as if it was by a single author. and the choices in the second half of the book, with its heavy emphasis on american authors, seem arbitrary. i think this book tries to do too much."
1,Edwards' Confusions,"It is sad to see a so-called 'professional philosopher' attempt to misrepresent another philosopher in order to discredit and riducule him. This is precisely what Edwards does in this book. The language he uses that reviewers have called 'lively' or 'witty' is actually nothing more than empty rhetoric against a straw man. The only value of this book is that it is a perfect example of what philosophy should NOT be. Unfortunately, I'm sure many readers will not see this book for what it is and walk away from it thinking that they understand Heidegger's philosophy. Of course there are problems and 'confusions' in Heidegger's philosophy, but this is hardly a proper way of addressing them. My advice is to read 'Being and Time' for yourself. Shame on Prometheus Books for publishing this and calling it 'a thorough critique of the philosophy of Martin Heidegger'. Misrepresenting and dismissing a thinker as 'obscure and mystical' is hardly a critique...and it is certainly not thorough."
1,4 and One Half Stars? You've got to be kidding.,"Robin Williams did a superb job with a slow,boring plot.Fifteen minutes into the movie we were ready to take a nap. This movie wasn't a thriller nor a murder mystery. We're not sure what it was and wished we hadn't spent $$$ nor wasted our evening.I read the book, which was great, but the screenwriter must have read something else or got his scripts mixed up.Don't waste YOUR time or money."
4,I was very excited to watch this...,"And was not dissapointed.He was a very disturbed man, whos fantasies were of things we take for granted every day. He portrays a lonley old man, who has developed photos for this family for years, and has grown attached to them throughout the years. He fantasises about them, and dreams about them.Its quite good, i reccomend you get up and go rent it and see for yourself."
1,Robin Williams' worst movie to date....,Okay so that may be overstating but honestly there was not much to like about this movie. The oddest moment is when he breaks into someone's house essentially to use their toilet.I get it... he wants to be a part of their lives. He lives vicariously though those with whom he is connected via their photographs.What should have been an interesting plot starring an uber-talented actor falls flat in the less than talented hands of either the writer or director. Not sure which one dropped the ball here but somebody did... and Robin Williams's best performance couldn't have saved this film.
2,Entertaining but lacking,"I was disappointed in this film as a whole. There were elements of it that impressed me, such as Robin Williams' performance as a psychopath. The cinematography and the lighting were good as well. The events lacked. This film didn't have much purpose. It was only an hour and a half, and it didn't live up to its potential. This could have been a great film if it had given the viewer more to think or talk about. It was just weak. This is not something that most kids would enjoy. They would be bored while waiting for Robin Williams to crack a joke, and its R rating reflects sexual content, including some nudity, and profanity. One Hour Photo was okay. It just was not a thriller that stands out among thrillers. It was weak. For a good psychopath movie, watch The Silence of the Lambs."
5,Even though dated b/c no one turns in film anymore still a tremendous portrayal of lonelines & isolation in contemporary society,Even though dated b/c no one turns in film anymore still a tremendous portrayal of lonelines & isolation in contemporary society.Robin Williams is usually far better than pundits state in reviews and this is really worth a watch; kinda film that stays with you a while....
5,One hour photo,"My mom suggested that I ordered this movie becasue she had seen the translated version into Spanish of this movie so she already knew what the whole movie was about. I personally love commedy like when Robin Williams came out in Mrs. Doubtfire so it was fascinating how Robin Williams played his role in this thrilling movie One Hour Photo but it is all due in part because Robin Williams is one of the best actors ever, he has an outstanding personality so when it comes to the movies he is alwasy prepared for any role and his movies are great. One hour photo is a great movie because it is very realistic since the plot involves what could happen to a family in real life, so this is a great movie to own."
3,Good..but......,"This movie had the potential to be really good. Infact, after the first half-hour it was so creepy I felt like a had to take a shower. But we all knew how it was going to end and it was no big surprise. I would have loved to given this 5 stars but it was not that great. But it ws good. Robin Williams is better playing weird characters instead of ""joke every 2 seconds"" characters. Showing the ending scene at the begining gave a lot of it away. And him laying out the pictures at the end was totally lame. But I did like the way he [messed] with his boss' head. That was cool."
3,A little disappointing,"After looking forward to seeing this movie for a real long time, I finally got the chance, and sat down to watch what I was hoping would be a real scary thriller and I have to say, that's not quite what I got.Robin Williams is excellent. It's been said before, but this would be one of his best performances either in comedy or drama. He is totally creepy and rather delusional. I also was very glad to see the gorgeous Eriq La Salle in the movie. But there wasn't one time throughout the whole movie where I got scared. I wanted one of those predictable chases or something, and this movie lacked it. Overall it was good, but don't expect to get freaked out - only creeped out."
2,A total Bore!,"Wow, I am really surprised to see that many people rate this movie as good. Both my husband and I were totally bored with this movie and thought it was dry and not very interesting.A waste of a rental..."
2,mutton dressed as lamb,"It occurred to me this film would fall flat on its face without the stunning shots of italian architecture and when i realised the ruse, it did of its own accord. Before that i had found the movie skimpy and whilst holding out for the film to maybe get going- I was kept on hold with shots of lovely old italian architecture.The stream of architectural photography throughout the film seems oddly like a deliberate distraction that dwarfs the story. In fact this is its pretentiousness taking centre stage.The architect is being poisoned we know that- but does the rest of the cast or screen-play? Poison is an intriguing theme always but meanwhile the drama potters about. The staging is magnificent but the actors vapid and tepid.God what a crashing bore."
2,Christopher Decker's Biased view,"True, the book is an good compilation of the various Fitzgerald translations of the Rubaiyat by Omar Khayyam, yet the editor, Christopher Decker, gives an extremely rude, biased veiw of the Islamic belief. Decker unneccesarily gives his enraging opinions, for example, he calls Prophet Mohammed (SAW) a ""false prophet"" of the Muslims. He openly attacks Muslim customs and beliefs, calling the Muslim calendar ""clumsy"". The editing is very unprofessional. Also, he attacks the Muslim Holy month of Ramadan. Fitzgerald is to be given positive credit for this book."
2,May not work with your Espresso Machine,"I bought this grinder, and the doser is too narrow, and does not fit the basket of either of my espresso machines (Krups and Saeco). Too bad."
4,"Excellent, but could still be improved","LOVE this grinder. Once we got the right setting -- in our case, 4 was the magic number -- we were consistently creating spectacular espresso. Quibble -- the doser really could use some work. You've probably read the comments by other users about the spring mechanism: ours is working fine so far, so that's not our problem (yet). But it is fantastically inconsistent: nothing, then an overflow of coffee on the next stroke. Lots of waste. We sigh, tamp, scoop up the spillings, make spectacular coffee, and move on with our lives. Great coffee is worth some effort."
4,No nonsense grinding...,I love how it grinds the beans perfectly and how you can adjust to exactly what your coffee needs for a perfect brew.The dispensing takes a little getting used to. Personal preference - you figure it out.
5,what's NOT to love?,having seen chris boti in person at the rochester international jazz festval and with the rochester philharmonica- what else can i say? i always wear my diamond tiara in case he wants to meet me!
4,Perfect for romance,"I love the soothing sounds of Chris Botti, especially on this CD. I can't wait to see him perform live - I've only caught him on television once, but that's all it took! He has that warm, full sound to his horn similar to that of Michael C. Lewis (also on Amazon.com). This is definitely a CD for a romantic dinner in."
4,"""When I Fall In Love"".....","Once again, Chris has brought us exceptional music with the release of ""When I Fall In Love."" This is for all intensive purposes an album of standards, with a few surprises thrown into the mix (like track 3; ""No Ordinary Love,"" which happens to be a Sade cover and track 8; ""La Belle Dame Sans Regrets,"" which happens to boast the vocals of Sting).Even though listeners may have heard these pieces time and again, Chris' unique arrangements, tone, and 'phrasing' breathe new life into them, and thus, make them his own. And as added bonuses, Chris' good friend Sting and vocalist Paula Cole lend their talents to some of the tracks. I would definitely recommend this album to classic and contemporary/smooth jazz fans alike, not to mention people who simply enjoy easy, good music."
2,battery operation horrible not recommended,It uses 4 AAA batteries.They last only 10 days. I used two sets of batteries that is eight batteries in twenty days.It is a good product if you want to spend $15.00 a month on batteries that is $180.00 a year.The only reason I bought it is because the winder said Battery or AC operation.I wanted to keep it in my Safe so I have to use it as battery operated. Right now I am using it with the AC adaptor plugged in and it runs fine outside the safe.It comes with no warranty I assume as there is no warranty information with the watch winder.
3,Old style tent,"Got this for my Honda element. A little buyers remorse, as the tent is not that cool and I've never really needed my car to attach to the tent. Less practical than I originally thought"
4,Lodge Square Dome Tent,"The opening is big enough that we not only use with our HHR, but we have also used it with the full size pickup/camper shell. It is easy to set up with two people, but one person will struggle unless they are very experienced with tent setup. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the tips came off the poles and we almost lost one before we realized it. We duct taped them on so they won't come off again."
2,Purchase with Caution,"After reading reviews and taking price into consideration, I settled on the Texsport. The directions, which I wasn't really convinced from reading other people's comments, were HORRIBLE. They printed a very easy to read ""list of what you need to take camping"" but the directions for putting the tent together were unreadable. The images where blurred so badly we had no idea what piece was what. If it wasn't for a nearby camper we would have thrown the tent back in the box. There is one spot on the window screening that is already ready to rip apart. The zippers to the main door will not work correctly. All the work that goes into manufacturing an item, it is too bad they didn't take the extra time to print clear instructions and check the zippers."
5,The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt,"Back in 1980's I was in college taking a class in american history on warfare. This was one of the books be had to read. Because we only took pieces here & there in the book, I never had the opportunity to read it front to back. I was one day doing some spring cleaning (old boxes), when I found it! Now I am reading it and finding/learning all kinds of cool stuff. I am reading Part One. It is a wonderful book to read to relax with before bedtime. Already I am learning so much about the Great Man he was. Some of our Presidents today need to read this also.The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt"
5,Great biography of a great man,"Great biography that is exquisitely written. Pardon the cliche, but I could not put this down. I was fascinated by TR's upbringing and his formative experiences as a young man. What a contrast to how a pictured him! This is an excellent first volume."
5,The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt,"The book is one of those that at times it is hard to put down. Teddy Roosevelt is a very, very interesting person. The author does a marvelous job in keeping the readers interest. I highly recommend the reading of this book.Rich from Chicago"
2,Uli Jon Roth - Guitar God!,"Although ""Living and Dying"" and ""Robot Man"" are absolutely horrible, In Trance is a must have for guitar players who appreciate solos. Uli Roth was probably one of the coolest guitarists who came out of the '70s. He's like, 50% Hendrix-ish and 50% neo-classical. (I prefer his neo-classical style). After listening to the title track, you'll agree that Uli is the father of neo-classical guitar and NOT Ritchie Blackmore! Uli's playing just ""screams"" emotion. Heck, just buy it for the instrumental, ""Night Lights""."
4,Great Record - Non Scorps Purists Would be Wise to Abide,"Love the Uli Jon Roth era. Taken by Force is my favorite album from the pre Tokyo Tapes days, however."
1,Aweful socks!!,"Worst pair of socks I've ever owned !! Supremely uncomfortable, makes my feet itch till it also bleeds !! Biggest waste of money ever !!"
3,"Stays put, but they are really tight.","These socks stay put that's for sure, but they are really tight at the top even after stretching them, wearing them, and line-drying them. I cut a slit at the top to give my calves a break and I don't have huge calves either."
3,"It's Great for Reference, but...","I have to admit, I was looking for a nice little compact reference book to have on my desk or in my knitting bag from a source I knew to be dependable. The information is dependable as it is in the larger Vogue Knitting Ultimate Knitting book format. The wiro binding is great to keep the book open at the information needed, but it is very flimsy and oversized for what I wanted...if I were to keep this book in my knitting bag it would probably fall apart within a week. As it is, I keep a rubber band around it to keep it together. A stiffer cover and smaller format would have made me a very happy owner of this book."
4,ankle brace,"Happy with design of this product. Needed a brace that would prevent ankle roll while playing soccer after several bad sprains. This one seems better than others I have tried. Also happy with company/ shipping, etc."
5,Great Price - Great Car Magazine,Road and Track is really one of the best Car Magazines still around - if you enjoy keeping up on the latest cars and love that they review the everyday driving cars as well for us that can't afford the thrill cars - thanks!!
2,Road & Track Magazine,I purchased a 1-year subscription.Pros : The subscription arrived/started in a timely manner.That's it.This lost my interest a long time ago but I felt that I needed to give it a shot again. I'm still not interested in it. This mag is totally out of touch. More competition reporting in this area of the automotive world would be bennificial to this mag.
3,Lots of shared content with C&D,"If you are already a subscriber to Car&Driver;, you will see that a lot of content is similar (same cars tested, similar editorial lines...). There is little track specific content and if you are a racer there will be very little satisfaction in that magazine for you.On the plus side, the subscription is really cheap and it is worth the couple of unique and interesting articles that you will see during the year."
1,Have not received it yet,"So I am forced to trash it with one star. I am not worried about loosing my money because I am dealing with amazon, but let it be said it is still aggravating to have to wait and wait and...you get the picture."
2,1.5 Stars,"If ever a band found itself trudging through the dense morass of intellectually stunted 80s metal, David Chastain must have founded that band. Were there only a few Spinal Tap like mishaps to provide amusement value there might be some reason for listening to this schlock, but there aren't, and just because I had to give it several spins doesn't mean you should be subject to the same torture. This is essentially just the same style of uninspired, paint by numbers shred metal Shrapnel puts out, only without the guitar heroics to give it a reason to exist. Sample lyric says it all: ""We're the kings of the world and we're gonna getcha, we're gonna getcha, the kings of the world""!"
2,Overwritten,"This book was such an effort to read! I couldn't put my finger on it till halfway through but...Every single line of dialogue ""has"" to be accompanied by an in-depth internal analysis of what each person's thinking!It's as though one person says, ""Hello, Sera."" Then: He wasn't sure about his feelings for her. He recalled back in the War when he was wounded, and it brought up huge emotions... And that'll go on and on before Sera says,""Hello, Tom."" (or whatever his name was.) Then SHE has to internally analyze: She could tell he'd been sweating, and smelled like fireplace smoke but not of the hardwood that he used in his estate--no, she could tell it was a hardwood only found on the coast near Brighton, which of course meant he had a mistress...And on and on. It takes like 4 pages for a conversation to really take off. Everyone's always assuming things they couldn't possibly have known unless they were psychic.Just too annoying to finish."
1,Flimsy Controls...,"DO NOT BUY THIS!!! I got a plug and play for christmas, and was really happy. I could already envision myself playing Ms. Pac-Man hour after hour on Saturday night. So when I ran over to the T.V., I pluged in the cables, turned it on, selected Ms.Pac-Man, hit the joystick down... Ms. Pac-man goes up, right into an awaiting Blinky.I don't know why, but this control is extremely flimsy. You go up, the charachter goes down. Turn the car left, takes about five seconds, and when it does, it collides with a car trying to pass you. Ms Pac-Man is horrific, especially. I can't even go pass one screen before falling in to the clutches of a ghost.So don't buy this. Bad controls, mainly. Don't waste your money. Trust me."
4,Ms PacMan Plug and Play,"I got this for a few friends for Christmas. I also have 2 of these for myself. This is the second version of the plug and play MS. PacMan. The second version has upgraded graphics and is more visually pleasing (not that there was anything wrong with the first version). I have noticed that the joystick is glitch-y. It seems to be fickle and difficult to direct at times. Sometimes it seems to have a mind of it's own and refuses to respond to the player. I love Ms. PacMan. I think the first version was a little more reliable in terms of joystick responsiveness. After I bought the second version, I reverted back to the use of the first version just because the joystick has greater sensitivity and responsivity in the first model! In any event, it is still a great game! I bought the A/C adaptor to decrease battery use, however I have yet to figure out exactly how to install the A/C adaptor, even after trying multiple times to install it."
1,Short Life,These used to be $20 a few years ago. The cords are way too cheap and continually need to be replaced along with a controller switch from time to time. Unless you are handy in the electronics field don't even think about buying one. I need 3 of these to keep one working.
4,Attention Getters,"Randal the Flannel CamelI loved the Astrobright Envelopes from Wausau. I bought them to send copies of my new book for children called ""Randal the Flannel Camel"" to friends all over the country. At first I worried that they wouldn't be strong enough to make it through the sorting process, but they worked out just fine. Everyone thinks the colors are great. Not easy to find until I look on Amazon."
1,"For the love of god, don't buy this book.","Rather than repeating what previous reviewers have said, I'll just note that I would like to strap this book to a block of C-4 and turn it into fine ash."
5,love this shampoo!,I love this shampoo and routinely buy it on amazon. it's wonderful for my hair! :)
1,Crush turned me Blue....,This movie could have been a whole lot better... If you have only half a brain you will love this movie... If you have more than that - save your money...
3,"Not enough surfing, but I enjoyed the scenery.",Overall the movie was cool for me. The storyline was so-so and there wasn't enough surfing. I did enjoy the bit of good surfing they had though. The main reason I bought the movie was because it was filmed on Oahu (although there were parts that I think may have been filmed in Maui but passed off as Oahu). The special features had some good footage.
4,"Lots of good footage, but the constant scene-switching is dizzying.","The documentary covered most of the top female surfers out there and some of the surfing spots around the world. There was a lot of good footage. Only thing I didn't like was the constant, blink-of-an-eye scene-switching during the action shots. It hurt my eyes...felt like I was going through some weird shock therapy at a mental institute :oP. Also, the interviews were a bit low and the background music for the action shots were high. So, I had to constantly adjust the volume."
3,blue crushed. this was a good movie but the second was better.,this movie was ok. not as good as the second one. but i did like how anne marie wanted to be on the cover of surf magazine and the fact that she achieved her goal!
3,The Pros and Cons of the dialogue and characters wipe out!,"Pros: Michelle Rodriguez, Sanoe Lake, some killer surf sequences, Beautiful people, beautiful cinematography, fun, humorous, interesting, brilliantly shot, good cast, refreshing ending, great story, nice subplots, an easygoing sense of exuberance, inspiring in-the-wave sequences, one feels he or she is actually THERE, formulaic plotting and drama, original location/setting in Hawaii, attractive women with goals other that being attractive,Cons: The romance, the little sister, time taken away from actual surfing, story dwells too much on failure and loses steam on land, familiar territory, some corny teen events, more time on land than on the water, some of the acting is pretty bad, occasioanl cliches and underdeveloped characters, not enough actual surfing, unfathomable romance, predictable moral-of-the-story, lack of originality and plot, middle drags on, no story line, and the sex scenes took away from the movie"
1,Sent them back,"The Amazon ad doesn't tell you that these are ""Birkies"" (plastic uppers) and not like regular Birkenstocks.The shoes actually cost $40 by the time they added taxes and shipping. I ordered a size 45 (US 12). When I tried on the shoes they clearly were mislabled. The shoes were at least two sizes too small. I called Champs about a return and they only defended their size chart. They would not address the missized shoes. They said they would refund my money minus $6 for shipping. After a number of phone calls and emails, I finally got a full refund from Amazon."
2,No more cork shoes for me,"Like many, I had long associated the Birkenstock brand with comfortable, healthy footwear (and granola and patchouli and...). When my current pair of Bohn sandals finally fell apart, I happened across this pair of Birki's at a reasonable price and decided to see what all the fuss was about. Yes, they were lightweight and comfortable, and the cork did breathe really well. For short stretches around the house, they were very comfortable. I discovered on a recent 4 day trip to the Outer Banks, however, that when I wore them for several hours a day or several days in a row, my feet became so sore that I resorted to walking around barefoot unless I absolutely had to have shoes on to enter a business or walk on the asphalt. My heel in particular suffered from the minimal give of the cork footbed. I am beginning to think a pair of Crocs may be more my speed."
4,Makes You Think About Your Current Wardrobe,"Spending all day indoors because of the snow, I read half of the book skipping some parts that I really didn't need to read. I found A Guide to Elegance a great read because it makes one think twice about how much money they spend on clothes that are rarely, if ever, worn. The author comes across a point when it comes to spending money on clothing. If you are going to spend money on clothes, spend it on items that are timeless classics and what is more appropriate to wear as oppose to buying it because it is on sale. More than likely, you are spending money on a sale item that is going to be put away and never, if ever, get worn. That is where the buyer is actually wasting money. I got some useful information out of this book when it comes to shopping for the right garnments and accessories and hope to put it to good use on my next shopping trip."
4,Great Classical Fashion Guide for Elegant Women,I like the way the chapters are organized. This book presents fashion in a way that assists most women so they can achieve their chic best. Not for those who are into fads and short-lived trends.
4,A Guide to Elegance: For Every Woman Who Wants to Be Well and Properly Dressed on all Occasions,I really enjoyed the book. It has been updated from when it was originally written in 1954 but still has a view that would probably be considered dated by a younger audience today. The author's style is delightful; many laugh-out-loud moments. I agree with most everything she offers. Dressing with class never goes out of style.
4,Stepping stone for people who wants to look elegance.,I am written on behalf on my boyfriend. He order this book for me and I really like it. Its the stepping stone for people who wants to look elegance especially for starters as this book gives you basic information. This book has inspired me to read other books that can take me to higher level. Its must read book.
1,Poor product description,"These are not ""Thin Wall"" sockets. They are regular sockets with a thick plastic sleeve around it making them unusable for my wheel application. If you have race wheels that require a thin wall socket, look elsewhere."
1,Why people why?,I am sure this game will be great (I am currently waiting for it to arrive) but why do these dumb... write reviews before a game is even out? I suggest that more people write 1 star reviews to get this evened out.
2,Overrated,"This game is 90% hype and 10% graphics. Highly overrated and very demanding of system resources. Be prepared to tweak your system to suit this game, and if it adversely affects other games - too bad. The sound is the worst I've ever heard even at that. CFS3 is FAR superior in that area. And, you will need to turn your sound hardware acceleration down just to avoid bugs. There is no ""runway"" selection for free flights. You can only start in the air. So you can't test various planes. Graphics are unmatched, though. Lots of eye candy if you have the hardware for it and you tweak your system properly.Rich"
3,A Bit Biased and in Need of Updating,"After spending a month in Nicaragua, living with a Nica family, I don't feel this book is completely accurate. First of all, it dwells on all the negative things that have happened in Nicaragua in the past (natural disasters, revolutions, foreign intervention) but, in my opinion, it needs to spend more time on the positive and how Nicaraguans have overcome these events. Although I consider myself somewhat left-of-center politically, this book is completely left leaning. I'd like something more neutral. It also blames many of Nicaragua's problems on foreign governments, and whereas there is some truth to this, it isn't accurate to be blamed for everything. Lastly, I feel the informaion is somewhat out of date. Although it says it was updated just two years ago, I don't think much was actually updated and changed."
2,"A Tedious, But Practical Text For Only the Beginner","Dry, dry, dry is the only way to describe the method of this text's approach to the work of the director of a live play. If directing a first project or working in the classroom, this book does contain useful tips for the analysis of a script, the use of various techniques in the staging thereof, and all the basic (and I mean ELEMENTARY) knowledge one needs to get a play off the ground from day one. But if seeking more insight into the art of it all, or a text not resigned to refer to the director as ""he,"" for the sheer simplicity it creates, one would do better to seek out the other numerous interview-style tomes, with pieces from great directors on their own approach."
2,"You get what you pay for, Vendor is good","This violin works fine. However here are the faults, and not just of this silent electric but of most, even the ones in the $500-$600 range.1. To heavy. This Violin is 10 times as heavy as a regular violin2. Can't use a shoulder rest on this Violin.3. Poorly constructed, gaps in the molding between pieces4. Felt like it would break after a couple of months of useI wanted to travel with this, but the case it comes with is just a bag. This Violin has strange deminsions and wouldn't fit in any case I could find. If you are thinking about purchasing an electric make certain it can use a shoulder rest (if you use those), can fit into a standard size case, and is well constructed.I emailed the vendor for a refund and this was done promptly and courteously."
4,Funny as Hell... is just that,"This is a superb performance by Adam Ferrara that pulls together some of his old and new material together into a spectacular hour long set that will have you laughing from start to finish.There is some foul language (so it certainly does not fit into the ""fun for the whole family"" thing), and those easily offended by religious jokes may find some parts a bit too course. Otherwise if you can sit back and just let it flow, Funny as Hell is exactly that."
1,Not melodic and sweet like their other work,"This is a very atypical Jefferson Airplane album. There's no ""Coming Back To Me"", ""My Best Friend"", ""Today"", ""Get Together"", ""Triad"", ""Lather"" type songs on it. It's raucous. You may like it, but be prepared for what it is, and what it isn't. You should know beforehand. It isn't my thing, but it might be yours."
4,A Compelling Read,"I cannot say that I loved this book--but something about it kept me reading. The writing is beautiful, although I must say, the author's decision not to use quotation marks didn't work for me with this one. Jiles is a poet, which is obvious throughout the novel. The story of Adair Colley starts of rather slowly. She is a young Missouri woman who is taken prisoner during the Civil War. While in prison, she is interrogated by Major William Neumann. Despite their differences, they fall in love. (There is no way to describe it without making it sound like some trite romance novel, is there?) They are separated and she travels the long journey home--hoping to find her father, her sisters, her horse, her home. Needless to say, it is a difficult journey. There are no surprises in this novel, but the writing is beautiful and it does vividly portray the horror of the Civil War. The story, despite its predictability is compelling."
1,disappointed,Had high hopes for this book but couldn't get into it. Really liked other books by this author but this is so slow to start I haven't gotten anywhere and quit reading.
3,Not a Page-Turner,"This book left me wishing that the author would have offered up more historical fact than she did. Obviously, her research was extensive, based on the references and quotes at the beginning of each chapter. I found those to be extremely interesting. I loved Adair's plight into the unfamiliar terrain, her drive and determination to make everything right again for her family, but I was put off by the hokey romanticism that was entirely unnecessary, in my view.The ending left me hanging also. Nothing happened."
2,A Lesson in History,"I enjoyed the book and read it in two days. Our book club chose it; I would not have thought to suggest it. Now that I have read it, I agree that it is a very good book for discussion. This book is both historical and fiction, and as such, you learn quite a bit re: man's inhumanity to man during the ""Civil"" war. The cruelty to the people is not often brought to the forefront when you read of the war itself, but in this book, I sometimes was taken aback by the casual way in which both sides reported horrible actions taken by the opposition. The letters and correspondence,(which are authentic), that open each chapter reveal a glimpse into the lives of ordinary people of Missouri and the military who are held in the vise of the war. This book would be appreciated more by readers interested in learning more of the Civil War; however, the telling of the tale of Adair Colley is a lesson also."
4,Beautifully understated,"Adair Colley is a marvellous creation, and this novel is a very worthy conveyance with which to bring her to you. In a beautifully understated but still highly descriptive narrative, she is revealed as a gritty and pragmatic survivor. Starting low key, and punctuated by actual historical excerpts, the horrific story creeps up on you, finally painting a full picture of both the times and a very alluring character. Paulette Jiles is a writer of some significance."
3,Slow,"The overall story was good, but slow! Maybe if one is familiar with the area they could better appreciate the heavy description of the land. I respect the bravery and strength of the woman in the story. I would have like more about her and less about which path she travelled. It is graphic in places, but so is war. I have yet to decide how I feel about the ending."
2,I expected more.,"This album is probably what the non-fanatic would expect. Better than ""Carmen Electras"" cd, but not as good as say ""Jerry Cantrells"" or ""Chris Cornells"" solo work. Funny enough to me, it sounds something more like ""Saliva"" or nu-metal, than it does ""Janes Addiction"" or ""Chili Peppers"". The first song is definitely the best one. But regardless of what this does and doesn't sound like, the songs become pretty monotonous, and some of the lyrics are high school-ish. Not that ""Trust no One"" is bad, but Dave seems more at home in a band, than on his own. I guess he's back with ""Janes"" now anyway. Get this used, if at all."
3,Pretty Good Stuff,"Most of what Alabama has done is simply great, they are one of the best country music groups to hit the scene. While this one is good, it kind of lacks the ""punch"" that put them in the spotlight, rather, it shows the more slow ballad style rather than up tempo. My two favorite songs would be the title cut ""The Closer You Get"", and ""Dixieland Delight"". If you want a quiet evening to lie back, relax and listen, then this one will be what you need."
5,Long live lovecraft,"Finally after a long wait this classic is now on dvd. I have to say this is just a little better then the the RE-ANIMATER. What makes this movie a great classic to own, it is release by MGM midnite movies. There's a chance this will be out of print. Than if you want it you have to pay big bucks."
5,Finally,"I'm sure everyone who is a horror fan has heard of this movie. It is my top favorite of all of all the horror genre. It's sick, its twisted and boy oh boy will it stay in your memory. Finally its on DVD. Reanimater has been available on DVD for the longest time, and while I thought that was great I'm so happy they put this on DVD format too."
3,"CREEPY, WEIRD, SEXUAL,FUN-I T'S STUART GORDON!","Nobody could of made this film but the legendary Stuart Gordon.I hadn't seen 'From Beyond' for at least 10 years, when I was little, and I must say I'm glad I had the pleasure of viewing this film again last night. From the moment the film started I was intrigued throughtout it all. I think the end impression one will be left with is that this is a little weird, imaginative film, but you'll have a lot of fun with this film. I have a huge amount of affection for the delightful Barbara Crampton and Jeffrey Combs.They were rightly cast and their performances are fun. Not as excellent as Re-animator but worth a look, especially for the Stuart Gordon fans.By Justine Ryan."
3,Sounds like Rush x Quasi,"Don't get me wrong. The Standard have talent. But why isn't anyone else saying the obvious? These guys sound a lot like Rush on their first record and Quasi + The Cure on their second. You will like this record if you like those bands and you like tons of keyboards in your ""rock"". Just don't get confused and think these guys are doing something new."
5,A sweet book for young girls,Readers of Little Women will enjoy this collection of flower Fables. I specifically downloaded this book for my 9 year old daughter who had enjoyed other books by Alcott. She finished it in an afternoon and rellay loved it. This was a new book for me and I enjoyed the lyrical stories by this beloved author.
1,Good,This was a really good book. I will give it five stars. I would recommend this book for anyone. It was very entertaining.
5,Amorphis' evolution!,"This Amorphis second album presents black metal with a touch of atmospherical and ambiental music. A lot, and I mean a lot, of keyboard is used in this album. Even the last song is mixed like techno music... a great blend!!! The use of clean vocals is also included in this album. Sounds strange but, it is kind of relaxing."
5,Hair Devine,"This works great on short, thin hair. Have used this for about 3 years. I would recommend to anyone that wants a spikey look on short hair. I have used other water based gels and this beats them hands down."
5,Excellent strong hold and no mess!,My husband loves this product. It does not cause white flakes or leave a visible residue. I would definitely recommend this product.
5,This stuff is the schizel,If you have short hair and don't want 1 strand to move this is the stuff. Excellent product that is easy to wash out and works like concrete. Best product I've ever used for spiking.
1,Superglue for Hair,"Good grief, I can't believe how much I paid for this! It's totally useless for me. Don't use it on hair longer than 1/2 inch. My hair is about 4 inches long, which I consider short, and when I put it on my hair, it was a nightmare. It hardened like concrete and I couldn't get a comb or brush through it without extreme pain. I brought the nightmare to an end by washing it out of my hair. Never again!"
1,overpriced and poor light output,"You can make something like this yourself with a higher output and lower cost. for almost $50, it's well worth your time.It's a nice novelty item if you've got money burning a hole in your pocket. It puts out as much light as a 20-watt bulb.I would avoid this puppy altogether if you're looking to replace any standard lighting."
4,great for the price,it s a nice perfume for the price. I have been using charlie from before and really adore its fragrance. I was looking for the best price in different sites and I found the best here.
5,Extreme Ice,This is a dazzling portrayal of the deterioration of the great Icecaps and glaciers of the world. Some heart-stoppin sequences of scientists decending into huge cravasses.
5,Scarily good collection!,"GIT really did a fine job with these comic collections. Too bad Marvel is now going totally online and won't let anyone have the actual comics in hand anymore. *sigh* Oh, well -- but if you can get it used (or from GIT), go for it. It's definitely worth the money!"
4,A Fun Read,"This is one of the best books by this author. Very memorable and a truly fun read. As in his other books, the author pokes fun at the wealthy gent who, in this case, decides to raise chickens. Interesting logic when he decides to run the incubator at a lower temperature for a longer period of time and belives that it all averages out."
4,Interesting,"This is a very well done documentary, combining the background to the Wrights famous flight with the drama of recreating and early Wright Brothers flyer. The only gripe I might have with it is that it has a somewhat incomplete ending. Were they ever able to successfully fly the plane they built?"
4,Beautiful Slack Key,"This is a wonderful piece of work by one of slack key's best talents. Ledward plays his own unique style of slack key, and this album has plenty to recommend it. Close your eyes, let the music take you to the land of swaying palm trees, active volcanos, and black sand beaches!"
4,Awesome first record for silverchair,"I love silverchair. The first half of this cd i perfer but it's all great. Silverchair in general is just an extraordinary band. This is not my favorite silverchair record but it still is worth getting. Some favorite songs include: shade, suicidal dream, israel's son and faultline. A song on this cd you might recognize is ""tomoorow"" which (in my town at least) is the silverhcair song thats gets the most airplay on the radio. Silverchair is just a great rock band."
5,An amazing CD!,"I have owned this CD since about 1997. I used to listen to this CD non-stop. I just recently picked it up again and I am as impressed as ever. For kids 14, 15, 16 years old writing this stuff, it just totally blows me away. Probably one of my favorite albums ever. I have just about every rock record you can think of that has been released in the past 10 years and this one is certainly in my top 5 if not the top."
1,Doesn't sound like the Silverchair I know!,"After listening to Neon Ballroom, this cd has an Eve6 type sound, except much heavier. Still, I think you should not waste your time with this cd, or Freakshow either. Instead, I reccomend that you check out Neon Ballroom. IT ROCKS!"
5,Rad,"THE best Silverchair album, closely rivalled by Freakshow and before they sold out with Neon Ballroom. The essence of Silverchair back in the days of good music, not pop crap."
2,It's OK I guess.....,"For their age, it's very good...But its nothing new. Honestly, If I wanted to listen to pearl jam or Nirvana, than I would put in In Utero or Ten...Not this. They obviously DO rip off Pearl jam and Daniel JOhn's voice is a cliche. I do like the songs Leave Me Out and Undecided...But other than that, It doesn't impress me."
5,Nice,"Ilove this cd. I love her voice! what a good kick back, kinda mellow, kinda groovy music. I would love to see these guys live."
5,SpringFest 2011,"This was my first Donna album and I still love it to this day!! Go check them out at Suwannee SpringFest this March in Live Oak, FL. more info and ticketing found at [...] discounted tickets for students and military"
1,Please STOP ruining the great memories of the ORIGINAL,"This is just the next in a long line of poor post-accident Skynyrd efforts. Why do they keep on releasing new C.D.'s and touring under the name of Lynyrd Skynyrd? This band is only the remnants of Skynyrd.You don't see the three surviving Beatles trying to tour under their name and claiming to be as good as the original. Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines, and Allen Collins must be rolling over in their graves. KEEP THE OLD MUSIC ALIVE, but stop trying to profit from the legendary status of the original band."
5,Worth reading again and again,"The distant human past is visible in the Orkneys, the low green islands in the sea north of Scotland. People who lived there five thousand years ago built fine stone tombs and henges older than the Pyramids.They watched the sky and kept calendars. And they used the right triangle of Pythagoras two thousand years before Pythagoras was born.It used to be thought that culture slowly radiated north from the Mediterranean to ignorant savages in northern Europe.But the people of the Orkneys turned our ideas about cultural diffusion upside down.Tomb of the Eagles is their enthralling story."
4,Warman's Pattern Glass,"This book was organized in a very concise easy-to-use fashion, giving manufactuers' and other pattern names for each design illustrated. The only drawback that I found with this book was the fact that the illustrations were not always as accurate as a photograph would have been."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in this book. The smells were VERY faint and there were not enough places to smell. My nephew wondered what the point of the book was because he couldn't smell anything.
4,So Beautiful Chinese Erhu Music!,"This is such a beautiful Chinese Erhu music cd! The CD is made in Japan, but Chen Min the Erhu player is from China, Suzhou(2 hours from Shanghai). Most of the songs in this CD are Chinese - the most beautiful one "" I want to be a swallow"" this is a very old song from 70's originally sung by a famous Chinese sopronal named ""Li Gu Yi"". Its beautiful, a little sad though, that's the number 9 in this CD is another version of the same song but with happier tune also has children's chrous....This CD is a little pricy but defitenely worth the price...Also if you love this CD - try some other Chen Min's CD"" Moon"", ""My story"" : I Love"".... ( the most beautiful CD of Chen Min's is called I love..but amazon.com hasn't list it yet...)"
2,"Nice watch, huge band","The watch is very nice, but if this is a ""mens standard"" length band, then Kenneth Cole must be produced in the land of the giants. I usually wear metal watches off the shelf, but this would need major adjustment--it must be two or three inches too long and there is no apparent way to adjust it. Back it goes to Amazon."
3,Great for tutoring students but not for Iowa Test Prep for Algebra,"Several sites recommended parents use this book for preparing for the Iowa Test in Algebra Aptitude. I am a local tutor who purchased it for my daughter to prepare, but it was outdated and way too difficult for a pre-algebra student. It does have some excellent problem sets...many of which will be challenging for my honors algebra 2 students, so luckily for me as a tutor, it wasn't a total waste of money."
2,Not as clear as I expected it to be,I took algebra in high school and haven't used it since so wanted to brush up. I find this book more opaque than I expected. Harder to understand. Not detailed enough
2,I was left disappointed,"Let me start out by saying I am very much a romantic, which biases me a little. So without giving anything away, I'll say that I wasn't very satisfied by the way this story wrapped up. Certain characters were made so likeable throughout the book, and certain relationships so dynamic and passionate, that I was inevitably disappointed when the plot took an abrupt turn toward the end, and cavalierly dismissed those things as fraudulent. The tacked-on happy ending wasn't happy as far as I was concerned, and a much needed confrontation was completely missing at the end. LIke I said, I don't want to give too much away to people who haven't read the book yet, so I apologize if this review is coming off as a bit sketchy. But I will just say, this is not a book I'd recommend for the hopeless romantics out there."
4,All arond fun,"The Color of BloodThis was a very unique film for an Indy production. Usually, an Indy film doesn't have this much work put into it... you can argue too much was put into this one. The camerawork and locations were nice and the monster was in the classic monster style. Overall a lot of fun, with all the flaws you'd expect in an Indy film production."
1,pass the relish,"Yeaahh!!! Mortician!!! This Rules!!! Actually, this is horrible. This CD belongs in the comedy section with bands like Dope. This music isn't exactly too broooo-tal! I don't think brutal music is supposed to make you laugh! Where do I start? The riffs are terrible, the vocals are monotonious and unoriginal, and the drum machine is reaaaal dumb. This is supposed to be death metal, not Abba. The lyrics are like the movie evil dead on paper. Oooh, and the samples strike fear into my heart. And to be honest with you, I wouldn't even care about mortician if they weren't so popular. I don't get it. Oh, and by the way, this isn't ""underground."" You can pick this up at a best buy for 12 bucks. I guess I better stop now before mortician puts me on the grill!!! And I guess by this point you think I listen to Ben Folds Five or something. That's not the case. For REAL brutal music I reccomend Angelcorpse, Krisiun, Krabathor, Immolation, Skinless, and Dying Fetus."
5,He loved it!,I bought this book as a gift for Christmas 2008. I was visiting there last week and the book was sitting on the kitchen table looking very used. He says he uses it all the time and just loves it. I'd say that was a very good rating!
4,Safety rails for Unimax Flames Steel Bed Wagon,"This is a good wagon but the standard depth of the bed is somewhat shallow. To aid in the safety of my grandson while riding in the wagon, I built pvc safety rails that sit on the sides of the wagon. The rails are held in place with bundgee cords the allow the rails to be removed as he grows older.Unimax Flames Steel Bed Wagon"
2,I bought this one for my wife ...,"... and she was polite enough to read half of it. One night, we were reading together and she could not keep it in anymore. She felt that Extremities was written with way too much focus on verbose descriptions. The focus on environment and surroundings made Extremities never scare her or even intrigue her.I read a couple stories from it, too. I can honestly say that the author seems really close to writing something good in her stories, but that they all lack that ""certain something"". This book is probably best enjoyed by true enthusiasts of this genre; otherwise, it is quite boring."
2,Merely a bad dream,"For me, the short stories' lack of ""story"" was fatal. I did not enjoy it.That aside, a dark picture is well painted."
4,Returning to their roots,"Here's a CD that demonstrates something every band should do at least once in its lifetime -- give tribute in music to its influences and roots. Amorphis does a fine job of this with the folk-tinged ""My Kantele (Acoustic Reprise)"" and the 70s-era roots-metal/hard-rock feel of the other four tracks. This EP is a very good change of pace from a band that's spent most of its lifetime cranking out death metal tracks."
5,"Fair, Timely, Important, Interesting","Perilous Times is a fascinating account, by Geoffrey R. Stone, of free speech in wartime, that is oddly both often a little frightening and quite hopeful. The six periods on which the author focuses are the sedition act of 1798, the Civil War, the two World Wars, the Cold War, and the Vietnam War. Three of these periods show a carlessness with the First Amendment (1798, World War I, and the Cold War) on the part of national leaders that is balanced with a less hysterical reaction in the other three wartime periods. The author is brilliant in analyzing why this is so and he tells a fascinating story of a progressive, though never inevitable or strictly linear, development of the importance of a free press and a free discourse of ideas, even (perhaps particularly) during times of national crisis. A brilliant, important, truly fascinating tale."
5,Wonderful hero. Very sympathetic.,"This is a lovely story. The hero is a retiring type, but is drawn out of his shell for the love of the heroine. I really liked him a lot."
3,"Works, But Doesn't Fit","This cable works fine, but it really doesn't fit in the receiver or other components I have it placed in. For example, when it's placed in the slot, it's really loose. It easily gets bumped out and doesn't 'snap' into place like other fiber optic cables. For the price, it's still a good deal and if you're not moving stuff around, then it will work great. Granted, I'm still using this until I get my new receiver which just uses HDMI, but I might still use this cable for backup."
5,Excellent collection,"It took them waaay to long to come out with a Gold Records Vol. 5 ! This is an excellent overview of the last decade of Elvis career. It includes most of his big hits from the period (Suspicious Minds, Kentucky Rain, In The Ghetto, Burning Love, and Way Down) and some not so big hits that may jog your memory (Clean Up Your Own Back Yard, For The Heart, Guitar Man, and U.S. Male). I especially like If I Can Dream, which I think is one of the most inspirational and underappreciated songs that Elvis ever recorded! Sure I wish they had included a few more songs, but still this is an excellent collection!Now if they would only come out with a Vol. 6 to catch some of the songs they missed!"
1,Bad Customer Service,"I received 5 of these tapes 3 weeks ago, 3 of the 5 were defective. Called Tandberg to get them replaced under warranty.We explained to the Tandberg rep that we had just received them and they were bad out of the box. Tandberg refused to exchange,There reason was, this is a wear item. Thankfully Amazon took these back."
3,love this movie,"The disc arrived quickly. It wasn't secured to the box so it is moving around in there probably getting scratched. I bought if as a gift for X-mas. So, hopefully, it isn't too scratched up. We will see."
2,one of the weirdest 'kiddie' movies ever,"This movie just doesn't really appeal to anyone. The only guy that kept me interested was the greaser. And the only reason I liked him was becasue he carries a knife, was always making threats, and he was very very funny. Other than that kids and adults will have a pretty tough time struggling through this movie. After collectign the cards growing up I had to pick this flick up when I saw it. If they would haev given it an R rating, the movie would have at least had a chance."
5,My Favorite Movie,It's one of the best movies that i've seen since i've been born. I would encourage any one to buy it.I promise that they won't regret buying it.
3,"""Muppet Babies with Snot""","The only reason it even gets 3 stars is because it's the freakin' Garbage Pail Kids. Any ""diehard fans"" (whatever you take that to mean) of the cards that have never seen the movie would probably be sorely disappointed. A bunch of kids or midgets in bad looking costumes (especially by today's standards) run around singing inspirational songs (huh??) trying to help some kid impress an older chick. Rats and thunder, wind and hail...send this disc back in the pail. Tasty lookin' toes, too."
3,"wow, it exists!",surprise christmas gift for my 10 year old step-daughter.she loooooves collecting the stickers and has been dying to see this movie.very happy to find it on amazon.
2,order not received,"ordered online, waited for and did not receive. Did get an e-mail w/a cancellations, and refund."
1,Wrong Book,"We orderd the Scarlet Letter CLIFF NOTES, but we were sent the Scarlet Letter BOOK. Ended up getting it somewhere else."
1,stinky!,"I first bought this exact product at a well-known health and supplement chain. When I saw the same product at Amazon, I thought I was taking no risk by ordering it online. Though the bottles and capsules inside look identical to what I had purchased in the store, the big difference was the stinky smell! The bottle I purchased in the store had no odor. The two I ordered via this website both stink! They are nowhere near the expiration date. I can't figure it out. It may be the gelatin in the capsules, but why didn't the first bottle I purchased smell? They may be fine, but purchaser should be prepared for this."
4,A Good Course,"I think that this is a good book if your intention is to immitate a college course on your own. The book was well structured, and the listening excersises were a great compliment to the book. The cassettes were not meant to be used on their own, and no where on the package does it claim to be a ""learn while you drive"" type of product. This book is meant for more serious users who plan on devoting a little more than their freeway time to Italian. My only complaint is that it has a very poor method of teaching grammatical skills that are often desired."
5,Better then these ratings show,"This album is full of new and unique beats/flows.I almost didnt give this album a try due to some reviews of it I'd seen but I am glad I did, people complain about him using his names in songs? what rapper dosen't? I think the people who wrote the previous reviews on this site obviously didn't LISTEN to the album, only scanned through for the catchy tunes on the radio.This is an excelent album and I'd encourage anyone with doubts to just give it a try, you won't be disapointed."
1,WOW,Is this how pathetic America is now. We think people like this actually have talent. THis could be the worst cd ever. I don't know what he will rap about his next cd because we know his name and number now. THis is painful to lsiten to save ur 15 dollars on something else if you want the same houston style get Slim thugs cd he actually has some ability.Worst songs- The whole album
3,For what it's worth,"When my boy got out of jail, he told me about this new rapper, MIKE JONES when he was still underground. We hit up the number and he actually picked up.. MIKE JONES, WHo?, MIKE JONES!!! It was pretty tight, we passed the phone around, we had no idea he was gonna blow up like he did. The album was aiight for like a month although it gets frikin' old real quick, but it was mad tight while it lasted. Now when we put MIKE JONES on everybody wants to turn it off. If you wern't there to hear MIKE JONES, it's not even worth trying anymore, you missed the boat, NEXT!"
1,I GOT TRICKED,"i heard back then and still tippin on mtv.i liked them so i bought the whole cd for just 2 songs.the rest of the songs SUCKED.i got tricked,but im sure im not the only 1.that cd was a waste of my $15 allowance.save your money or buy something else like mobb deep or jay z.stay away from gay swishahouse."
4,WHO?,"Even though he repeats his name a million times in that CD, and he repeats his phone number just the same, it was still a good CD. Not a lot of variety to the CD, but, #15 explains why. For it being his first CD, it is really good and I like to listen to it alot."
1,A musical masterpiece,"OMG!!!! OMGOMGOMGOMG!!!! Lyk dis noo Mike Jones cee dee is da fresh-st noo s**t on da blok!!! Da way he raps his name ovr and ovr es soo phat!!!!! I LUV da way he shows his icEEEES and his grillz es lyk so TYTE!!! Muv ovr led zep-lin, cause deres a new leg-nd n town, n his name es mike jones! who? mike jones!!!Honestly, if you believed any of that, on your next trip to chicago or New York City, go to the highest floor of the Sears Tower or Empire State building and jump (seriously)Oh, and Led is infinitely better then this loser."
1,Pretty unnecessary,Why would you need this??- the Garmin iQue 3600 Auto Navigation Kit will charge as well as this item and has the added advantage of allowing you to use the Garmin 3600 as it was meant to be used...as a hands free GPS navigation system.
2,An interesting book,An interesting accounts that details to much on the fictionized stories concerning these slave revolts. The book seriously neglects what happen to the crews and the slaves themselves.
1,Bad remastering,Amazon description is inaccurate.This was not released in 2008 as mentioned but in 2000.Sound is too harsh and shrilly.It might sound OK in a car stereo but in a good Hi-Fi system it definitely will reveal how bad it sounds.This might not have been remastered using the original master tapes and it looks like engineers are not very experienced.
5,Guess Who Comes Alive!,"The Guess Who were one of the more popular bands of the mid-60's to early 70's. The group put out fairly successful singles and albums, so imagine how great it was to get a good live album from this band! Burton Cummings had a lot of attitude back then, and in an era when most bands were lip synching with backing bands made up of musicians you would not recognize, this group could play. Back then, this album ranked up with Ya-Ya's from The Rolling Stones and Live at Leeds from The Who as one of my favorite live albums. ""Pain Train"" allows Burton Cummings to get up to speed, and ""Runnin' Back to Saskatoon"" really rocks, along with Cumming's clever lyrics. Another guilty pleasure for us baby boomers to enjoy and relive our younger times."
4,Great moment in time,"Growing up in Canada, this was one of my favorite live albums. Sixteen minutes worth of American Woman alone was worth the price.This version includes additional songs - all of them hits - but doesn't really enhance the vinyl experience which was a tight set.Still a very good listen for those into the Guess Who."
1,Overpriced; Bad Manual; Horrible Support,"Buy another camcorder! This one will be a waste of your time and money. On paper this camcorder is great. However, not only is it overpriced and full of extraneous features. It is also difficult to use, has a poorly written manual and horrible support. I tried the SONY product support line at 888-449-7669 twice, but got little help.Additionally, writing to the memory stick produces poor quality images, and there is no built in video light. Finally, the PC software that comes with the camera leaves much to be desired.My excitement about buying this camera and all its accesories has been replaced with utter contempt for SONY. I now understand why the company has been having so many problems."
2,Good for little kids.,"Please keep in mind that this isn't a DVD for adults who enjoyed the original ""Beauty and the Beast"" on an adult level. It's made for kids and it works for kids - especially little girls who can't get enough of Belle.A few other reviewers have commented that the Beast was too scary in the last cartoon, where he keeps a little bird in a cage. Personally, we didn't think the Beast was scary. In fact, he acted a lot like a little kid having a temper tantrum, and our daughter thought he was funny. But, a word of caution: after the Beast finally set the bird free, our two-year-old decided to emancipate our pet bird, and became upset when she couldn't. So pet-owning parents should be prepared to have a long talk after viewing.On the whole, our daughter finds ""Belle's Magical World"" entertaining and, while it's not our favorite thing to watch, it was worth the price."
1,NOT the original!,"BEWARE! This is NOT the original movie (Disney has it in the ""vault"" and not available for retail purchase). It is a compilation of 3 Belle ""adventures"" thown together to grab some bucks from unsuspecting viewers. I usppose it is ok if you just want some stuff to keep the kids busy."
5,Live-An Evening with Crystal Gayle,"WOW....What a great set.Crystal Sounds better than ever and looking good.The full length DVD was worth the price.Mostly songs from early on,thereis some new material like""MIDNIGHT IN THE DESERT"" She did for radiotalk show host Art BEll of Coast TO Coast AM that he signs off with.she also did""YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW MY NAME"" a very important tributeto our troops and how she would like to thank them for what they do.very good song.MY FAVORITE is""THATS WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE SOUTH"".Well done Crystal,Huge fan."
5,Prepare yourself .,"This cd will rattle windows and walls.Total attack on ones eardrums.I like ultra marine blues the best .It has variety of sounds some eerie haunting sounds in it.Merzbow is just everything.BEst god of noise.No one can compare to his greatness, and higher standards of being the best noise-maker on the planet.Pick it up .Trust me everyone for miles will tremble in thier shows its just that frieghtning and sometimes beautiful.One word for merzbow and thats amazing.Well worth owning as a variation to constant diet of metal and other music.Trust me noise is better it really hold much more power then any metal could ever hold.UNLEASH THE BEAST FROM THE EAST . and buy this cd today.This is my first merzbow cds and isn't gonna be the last .I am out to buy lot more of his stuff.masami akita rules."
5,The Wonder of Chaplin,"The Music of Charlie Chaplin is an excellent view of Chaplin's musical genius. Here is a musical treat that offers a wide range of his composing talent. The compilation gives the listener a musical pallet that paints auditory pictures ranging from the romantic to fast-paced tunes.....and at such a bargain!For those who are familiar with, or are new to, Charlie Chaplin's amazing musical ability, this album should not be missed."
1,Not as good as the original,"Bought this game for my sister who was travelling. I recently visited her and find that this game in the Vegas mode will allow about 1 win in 100 - 1%. The satisfaction of getting the game to a win is exceedingly low.This version is not as good as the original, which allowed a much more frequent game play / win ratio. Overall the bells and whistles added to this new edition to enhance it, are no compensation for the lack of wins.A big disappointment over the original which was a lot more fun to play."
5,This is the best love song ever.,"I love this song, and I love Voices of Theory. I hear the song, I stop every thing and blast it, because it reminds me of that special someone."
4,The shoes are good. But the free shipping takes for ever.,"The shoes are good. But the free shipping takes for ever.You might be able to get it cheaper at an outlet store (great mall, milpitas, CA). I had to buy it online since the outlet store didn't carry the 9.5 WIDE shoes for my son."
1,Unbelievable,This is a most unbelievably badly written book. It must have been dictated and never proofread. I am amazed that it could find a publisher.
5,I absolutely loved this movie!!!!!,"This movie is awesome! I've loved this movie since I was a little girl and it continues to be one of my favorites. granted, the glowing Jesus eyes were a little scary for me as a little kid, but still, there's nothing wrong with anything in this movie. I think it was very creative and nothing like anyone expected it to be. I seriously reccomend this for all garfield fans, it's spectacular!ps: about that lady that was all about God this and God that- she took this way too seriously and she can't get her story straight (ie: God asked odie if he was a CAT, not a dog)....."
5,Catchy without being trendy,This artist will be around for a long time. Her songs are not only catchy but they have staying power. Kirsten is a very talented song writer and singer. Every song on this album is a hit which is so unusual. Everyone can relate to her songs because we've all been there at one time or another. I feel like she wrote these songs esecially for me and i'm sure you'll feel the same way. This album is FANTASTIC.
1,All Hype,"Boy was I let down. For all their hype about the spirituality and depth of the music, I can see through it all fairly easily. These guys have no talent. To their credit, they are patient and I will admit somewhat creative in their idea. And, no this disc is not like the rest of the metal records out there now. They have set themselves aprt (for better or for worse)But this disc rides on atmosphere and just plain strenge noises. There is not one good guitar riff on this album, no lead guitar whatsoever. There just isn't any quality instrumental work. They attempt to take you into a dark world and try to almost put the listener in a trance. I believe this record fails for its lack of substance. I wish a band with some more ability would try to do what Neurosis is trying to do."
1,Nothing on disk,"I tried to install this on 3 different PC's, one running Windows 7 x64bit, one running Vista and one running windows XP and none of them would allow this game to install due to the disk being void of data. I received a disk that was labeled and looked like a game disk yet it was an empty disk, all dressed up lol . Glad it was only $4 or I'd be seriously pissed off haha."
2,weak..,"theres not much to say about this one. Friday was hilarious, Next Friday was pretty funny and ok, Friday After the Next didnt change the direction.. 5 stars, 3 stars and now barely 2.the plot was weak, the jokes were not as good as before, the some of characters were annoying and had been taken to ofar so on.. really cant think of anything good to say, a pity."
3,Funny At Times,"""Friday After Next"" is the third installment in the ""Friday"" films starring Ice Cube. In this installment, Craig and his cousin Day Day begin new jobs as security guards for a strip mall where their family owns a restaurant. The night before, Craig and Day Day are robbed by a guy dressed as Santa Claus. Not only did the robber steal their Christmas gifts, but he also stole their rent money, which is, of course, due the next day. Thus begins a Friday filled with things going wrong and seeing just how crazy people can be.While there are some very funny moments in the film, it somewhat falls flat. Ice Cube and Mike Epps are very good together as Craig and Day Day, but many of the other characters start off as funny and then become annoying.Fans of the ""Friday"" series will love this installment, but I personally look forward to seeing Ice Cube in the sequel to Barbershop."
2,This should be called last wednesday!,"Yo this movie was horrible! I am a crazy fan of the original Friday movie but the next two got progressively worse. This DVD barely had a plot. Very un-funny comedic attempts, I really blame Mike Epps. His comedy is just not on par with a Chris Tucker. The characters are just recycling same old bits. I say check this out from blockbuster."
3,Good but i thought they said your favorites were commin back,"ok where the hell is Chris Tucker, he shoulda got outa rehab by now, i'm sorry but witout tucker they just don't seem right, i mean next friday was resonable since u knew smokey was goin 2 b gone but still they shoulda brought him back for this 1"
4,Not bad at all.,"I first stumbled across These Green Eyes unintentionally on Limewire about a year ago. After hearing Why Hawaii (the Demo version) I began to follow their progress until they released House of Glass.Anyway, onto the album. A more accurate rating would be three and a half stars, House of Glass isn't quite worth four stars but it's certainly better than a three star album. Most of the songs on the album sound a little like weak Post Hardcore. If you're unsure as to whether to get their album or not you could always download their songs from Limewire (their entire album isn't available but some of their better tracks can be found there).Tracks that stand out: Self Inflicted, Crimson, Why Hawaii are the best tracks on the album, followed by Watch The Lights Go Out, Stay Awake and Bouquet."
4,Nice old movie,We bought this movie for our grandkinds. They enjoyed watching it. It was really funny watching a movie made 50 years ago- things have really improved in movie making! It was a fine movie- appropriate for children! Brought back memories.
1,"OK, but not great","I managed to record all of 2 hours worth of video. Now, it will not load a cassette anymore. It comes up with a C:31:40 error and grinds to a halt. Sony's web site and support are horrible when it comes to fixing this.I used to be a Sony fan. I bought this thing because of the Sony label. No more. The Sony brand has lost it.I returned the camera for service, costing $250. I got it back and tested immediately. Same problem occurred after 1 hour of recording.I returned it again, Sony willingly paid shipping. Camera eventually came back and has been reliable. Fine as an indoor and fair weather camera."
2,Disappointed in sharp plastic seams,Received the Little Tikes Rocking Puppy today. Ordered for a birthday present for a one year old. I was very disappointed in the sharp plastic seams. Poorly seamed and/or trimmed. We had to use a razor blade and sandpaper to trim and smooth. Plastic seams sharp enough to cut delicate baby skin. VERY DISAPPOINTED in this Little Tikes toy.
4,Little Tikes Rocking Puppy - a good buy,"My daughter enjoys her little rocking puppy. She figured it out right away and loves playing with it. It has also helped to teach her the color ""Blue"". We really like the product's stability. It's a safe, fun toy. It does slide a bit when rocked vigorously so we have to keep pulling it back away from the wall, but that is the only con I can think of. I would recommend this product."
5,Excellent toy,My grand dauhghter loves it. She has the rocking dog at her day care center and was thrilled to see it at her house. Shipping was fast and quality was great. I would recommend it.
1,Save your money!,"Yes, this toy is very affordable BUT you might break a finger trying to hammer the pieces on. Whoever designed the accessories to be installed with a hammer and a piece of wood should be fired... stickers would have been alot easier and safer.STAY AWAY!!"
4,Little Tikes Rocking Puppy,Little Tikes Rocking PuppyThis item was purchased for my granddaughter 2 years agoIt is still in good enough condition for my younger granddaughter
1,Very poor quality,"Do not buy this or any product from this supplier. This is a very cheap product. Ordered two belts and both were defective. The ""leather"" split apart. Freight charge is way too much. Vendor will not return calls."
1,You get what you pay for...,The belt started peeling after about a month. Poor Quality. I'd definitely spend the extra money next time and buy one that lasts.
3,KDG820-WEAV,"The clock does not display when the car is on and the radio off.The clock does not keep time when using the USB, the clock is displayed and blinks like it is working but it does not keep time"
1,I want to get back my bag,"I sent you my fendi bag about 20days ago because when i sent you a mail that my bag has lots of problems, you sent me a reply mail and said that you will fix it with no charge.However, i still didn't get my bag.Plz let me know when i can get back my bag or refund my money."
4,Worth picking up,"I was quite impressed with this cd. Theres a lot of talent on here. My personal favorite is Violent Generation by Brutality. It's easily the best instrumental i've ever heard. It's a shame they didnt make a soundtrack for Traces of Death II which in my opinion had better death metal. But in any case, this is worth buying. Get the movies too!!!"
4,A good basic resource,I think this is probably best for people that need basic info. For the person that needs to write an indepth paper or do indepth research this is probably not the choice for you. It's a good basic tool for the beginner though.
1,EXACT SAME PROGRAM as HIGH ACHIEVER Pre-Algebra,"What a rip-off. I bought THESE because the covers looked a little more intelligent than the HIGH ACHIEVER series of Algebra products but, this is the EXACT same program; identical. Very cheesy, DOS-type presentation. It's packaged differently but it's another AMAZON software rip-off. This is getting old fast.The ALGEBRA BOOSTER was OK and I had somewhat decent hopes but seeing the exact same thing boot up when I loaded this disc just made my stomach drop. I just bought some shiester dinner, courtesy of Amazon.com....again."
1,titles switched,i bought this album to get the song hey little girl and little red riding hood neither of these songs is on the album they have been substituted with other songs.the songs on the album are great rock and roll songs but as i said the 2 songs i bought this album for and were advertised as being on this album are not.talk about false advertiseing
1,Pictured Item,"It would have been nice to have the actual picture of the item to be shipped, rather than the picture of the Garmin item that you wanted. I realize it was lower priced, But when you show one picture and deliver a differant product it feels like your being taken advantage of."
5,I loved the Sermon on the Mount,I liked this book so much that when I finished it I started over reading it. The whole book gives the author's explanation of the meaning of the book of Mathew (sp?) from the bible.
1,Battery,This battery didn't perform any better than the one it replaces. That led me to wonder if it was in fact a new battery.
1,A cheap imitation of a fun game,"My kids love to play skeeball (at arcades) and skillball looked similar so it seemed like a perfect match. However this game is cheaply made and not durable at all. The netting that keeps the balls in play was the first thing to break, which resulted in little objects being shot all over the house and under chairs. Once the fascination of ""shooting"" things wore off and with the broken netting (which is plastic of course) the kids put it away and it soon found its way to the trash. Save your money, it's not even worth the little they want for it here."
3,"not bad, not great","it does the job but is cheap in quality , no wonder it costs so little. shipping is more than the item itself."
1,This book is completely out of date!,"I just took the 1998 Subject test last week, and I can tell you it does not at all resemble the practice tests in this book. Although this book has a 1997 copyright date, I discovered after months of studying and stressing out that it contains practice tests which are clearly extremely out of date. I took four of the six tests in the book and scored in the 50-60th percentile each time. This surprised me since I have quite a good background in English lit. So I set to work cramming all kinds of obscure authors and literary terms. Then I got the official practice book from the ETS, and surprise! It contained a very different practice test, with much more contemporary questions on literary theory, non-canonical writers, etc. I sat down and took that practice test and scored in the 99th percentile! All that pain for nothing...Don't make the mistake I made! Find another practice book, and make sure it contains test questions similar to those in the official ETS book."
2,Maybe the first 20 pages are helpful,"I bought this book before reading all of the bad reviews on amazon, but it cerainly deserves the poor reviews because it was really not that helpful in preparation for the Lit GRE. The first few pages have reviews of major authors in different periods which helped to narrow down the ones to review, but the practice tests are ridiculous. The questions are extremely specific and trivial and do not reflect the true nature of the exam. ""Cracking the GRE"" by the Princeton Review is more helpful, but honestly the best prep one can do is grab some Norton Anthologies and review that way."
4,I want a year's supply of whatever these geezers are on.,"These guys could be Good Charlotte's grandparents. This CD would burn the mohawks off that band at 20 paces. It's almost too intense to listen to all the way through. Just a tad more metallic than their earlier records but still flys that Oi/Crust flag high. Recommended, if for nothing else to prove that old codgers can still melt young whippersnapper's faces off if they put their minds to it."
5,I hate punk rock,The Exploited are the worst punk band of all time and this album proves it. They all deserve to die and rot in heaven. And pigs just flew by my window. So I guess you really should buy this album. It motivates you to get up and start a war. So go riot and bomb a city or something. (joke)I don't want no Feds coming by my house calling me a terrorist either.
4,Really makes you think about American culture...,"Meet the Applegates (original title) shows just how consumer driven Americans are! Sex, Drugs, Rock n Roll and don't forget the home shopping network. Can we really live without our credit cards? All these questions are answered and more by an unexpected source, a cockaroach! Or, should I say a family of them! They can live through a nuclear fallout but not commercialism in America! A must see for all camp movie fans. Please revieve this movie and put it on DVD so I can buy it!"
3,Send up of Suburbanism,"Although Michael Lehman and Denise di Novi's follow up to their brilliant satire Heathers is not as wicked, it is an equally bizarre slant on middle class American life."
3,"COLD STL TI-LITE ZYTEL 6"" STS/BLK",BIG knife. Bigger than I thought it would be. I like the quality of the knife but it is not meant as a boot knife or a pocket knife. Better to be used as a demo piece.
3,Not Great,"Other DVDs in the series were much better. I don't know why they say it's uncensored. It's all ""G"" rated. It's ok, but not great. I wouldn't buy it again."
4,"Sounds great, but how about some more seasons?","The episodes included are, for the most part, big time favorites of mine. However, I hope this isn't a cop out for the studio to release a ""Best of"" and be done with it instead of releasing the rest of the seasons. There are too many classic moments of this show which haven't been released yet and won't be in this set. Still, I will be buying this one. As a dedicated WLIIA fan, I can't pass it up."
4,Stuido Cop Out?,"hmmm.... as with above sentiments, this better not be a cop out so that they don't have to release any more eps.... As with others, I bought the first 2 dvds and have been eagerly awaiting the next instalment. I also would have preferred them to release a box set of all Season 1 eps, then move on to Season 2, etc. I'd happily pay whatever was necessary to know that I had every ep of this incredible show. (especially since we were never lucky enough to get the whole series here in Australia).Please don't be a copy out - please give us the whole series! Pleeeeeese!!"
4,Garmin iQue 3600 auto navigation kit,Works very well in auto. Keeps battery charged and allows brighter screen for 3600 than the PDA battery alone would allow.
3,"Good product, but not slip-proof","You might get the impression from reading the other reviews here that this device never loses its grip even under off-roard conditions. Sorry to say but this isn't true. At least on my sloping dash, I have had to place it on top of one of those ""sticky pads"" to get it to stay in place at all. And it still isn't really that secure. As others have said here, it would be hard to live without now. The unit is very flexible in positioning the iQue for best visibility, and the charging cable/speaker is great, though a bit bulky around the power plug. Still, until something better comes along this is probably your best choice."
4,Dr Manny' book,"This is a good book about health and healthy living. It is organized by one's decade in life. It's an easy read, and it's easy for a layman to understand. I can recommend this book to anyone who's health is important to them, and who doesn't want to wade through endless medical mumbo jumbo."
5,The Checklist,"This book is the Dr. Spock book for adults! Parents live and die by Dr. Spock's advice, written in easy to understand terms. Now there is a similar, comprehensive, easy to understand book for managing adult lives & health issues. A must have for all."
2,Merley Repulsive,"This sounds like bog-standard industrial. Loud and noisy, sure, but makes little real impact. I can't recommend it, really - there are so many albums out there that do this a whole lot better."
5,Donald Hamilton is best spy novelist,"I've read all of Hamilton's books starting back in the 1960's. He is absolutely the best writer of this genre, ever."
3,Red Heart Wreath,"I like the heart wreath. Was disappointed in the size. Wish it was 24"" in size and would light up, so it could be seenat night. I hung it oudside on the porch beside my front door. It really looks nice. I would recommend it to my friends."
1,A Horrid Album,"Seminal Vampires and Maggot Men is, even by grind-core standards, a terrible release from Abscess. Of course, the formula is in full effect, members blasting through ludicrious songs at top-speed. Unlike most other (and better) grind outfits, they also seem comfortable at injecting some different styles into their one deminsional sound such as punk and sludge. Heck, judging from their overall attitude, it's obvious that the band is just having fun. Unfortunately, I had no fun listening to it.-l-"
1,Lots of assumptions,I find it interesting that a book was written based on forum posts. No evidence that the company in question is guilty of anything has been presented. I will wait for the investigation to be over before i pass judgement.Doggy
3,Campy with a great title song by the Seekers,"The movie plays as good as you expect any other DVD to perform. The movie itself is camp and the best thing about it is Lynn Redgrave and the title song ""Georgy Girl"" by the Seekers featuring Judith Durham who is a great singer."
5,Convenient and affordable,"Great item. I was a little hesitant in buying one because of all the hype behind the Apple iPod, but it seems I made a pretty good choice. Very easy to use, the software (SonicStage) copies files real fast. The Minidiscs can carry up to 5 hours of music at minimumbit rate mode, in which the quality of the songs have no apparent change. It's durable too, I dropped it once real hard and it only got a small scratch (I hear iPods break real easily). The only drawback to this product is the organization of the music. You can't make seperate playlists or select a song to start with, you'll have to search for it, and you'd have to keep changing mini-discs when you want different songs. Those are minimal flaws however that most people could live with, and I recommed this over any MP3 players."
5,mini disc player,very easy to use piece of machinery. Easy to record from CD to walkman. The sound is great and the earplugs are very comfortable. Great for traveling on planes and working out in. Small enough to fit in a pocket and does not skip.
5,"GOOD dictionary for the teachers of Russian, stjudents,lingu","The excellent dictionary for the teachers of Russian, students and linguists. Is constructed on associative - semantic communications. In one dictionary article: a synonymic line, antonomy-line, dictionary of compatibility, numerous examples and ideomatical combinations and phrases. The excellent dictionary. It is very a pity, that has not purchased the dictionary earlier! This dictionary very much helps in my activity of the computer linguist."
3,A little gore for ya,"Total sonic meltdown with incredible drumming and creative, original guitar and bass work. Get this or die ignorant!"
1,RAYMAN HAS GONE TO THE DOGS!! Rated E? No way!!,"What a let down! The storyline, if there is one, is horrible! The characters are annoying, even Rayman! UBIsoft, what have you done to the Rayman franchise us die hard fans have come to love since the original 2d Rayman sidescroller game?What is the most dissapointing part is that UBISoft has woven a little ""Adult"" humor, and swearing(religiously based) into the game. I was shocked to see this in a ""E"" rated game, let alone a Rayman title.UBI, you really botched this one. Graphics=8, Story=0, Fun=0.You need to re-hire the original game writters,programers,and storyboarders that you had on the Rayman 2.Pass this game up at all costs! Get Rayman 2 ""The Great Escape"" instead. There is how Rayman is meant to be played."
3,Quick and Easy Read!,"I was surprised by how quickly I was able to read this one. It was light and entertaining, with strong, well written characters, but I give it only three stars because it's not very original. This is just ""Affair"",""With this Ring"", and ""I Thee Wed"" all over again, only with different characters. Ms. Quick needs to find a new subject matter. I found her ""Don't Look Back"" and ""Late for the Wedding"" series better and more refreshing. I look forward to more installments from that series.One great thing about Amanda Quick is the names she gives her protaganists. A hero can have a name like Arthur and still be handsome, strong, intelligent and get the beautiful girl and not be just some wimp who ends up as a background character."
3,I hate to say it....,"I'm a big Quick fan, but it seems like this story was lacking somewhat. The characters were all of the same sort I enjoy, but maybe that is why I couldn't get into it. Same old song and dance? (""Wince."") Perhaps this is why so many new fans like this book?If you're new to Amanda Quick I would recommend Ravished or Desire."
4,Couldn't stop reading near the end...,Definitely a fun read! I LOVE Amanda Quick and I've been waiting for another one of her books and I am happy to say that though it took awhile it was worth it. The mystery in the book enhanced the reading though I wish that the characters had been more fully developed.
3,An Enjoyable Read,"I came across this book and thought it sounded interesting. As I was reading the book however, I noticed that the main premise and some of the details seemed to have been borrowed from the movie ""Pretty Woman"". While it is not completely the same there are several similar elements. The heroine, Eleanora. is a paid companion hired to pose as the hero's fiance while he investigates his uncles murder.This book is an absorbing read and holds the attention easily. The book would have been better with less description of their romance and more attention to the narrative. Much is skimmed over that the reader is curious to know more about. While the book is a romance, it should appeal to even those who do not like romance fiction. The author could easily write mainstream fiction and be a success at it. This is the first novel by this author that I have read, as I generally avoid romance fiction. In summary, a good read and an enjoyable plot."
2,Uninspiring tripe,"This is my second attempt to endure Amanda Quick/Jayne Ann Krentz (see my other review about Wildest Hearts). To be truthful, I purchased this title during a layover in a New England airport, an act of unfettered desperation on my part. I've owned this pile of you-can-figure-it-out for three weeks and I haven't finished reading it. I can't--it's that much of a lullaby. I'm guessing Amanda Quick was equally bored when she penned it, and frankly, for it to have made it to the shelves at the bookstore, someone at her publisher's was asleep at the wheel--no doubt the result of having read this book as well. Do yourself a favor if you need something compelling to read--DON'T patronize any other book with the names Amanda Quick or Jayne Ann Krentz on the cover. If you do, you won't be reading, you'll be SLEEPING."
4,a whole new world,"Using this telescope opened up a whole new world to my children. Educational, durable, and fun."
2,Orchestra does Mario a disservice.,Flat. Background muusic blah. Lanza would have been better of without the orchestra.seven more words blah blah blah
2,Not the Lincoln Food Service pan that you want,"Thought I had found a great deal on the highly-rated Lincoln Foodservice half-sheet pans. I put the brakes on and cancelled my order after doing a little research, and finding out that these are the ""Economy"" weight and gauge pans. (The ""Professional"" designation intially threw me). THESE ARE NOT THE PANS YOU SEE ALL THE TIME ON TV.You need to get the 13-gauge Lincoln Foodservice pans, which are twice this price, plus shipping from a third-party merchant. I wish Amazon would carry these in stock instead of through a third-party vendor,so I could order two and get free shipping. I do own the 13-gauge pans, and they are quite nice - heavy and sturdy."
4,Best jelly roll pan ever,I read about this product in Cooks Illustrated magazine and they were not wrong in their recommendation. It does not warp which was a problem with every other jelly roll pan I've bought. It looks like this will be the last pan I will have to invest in. I've had these pans for over a year and no problems yet and I like its shiny finish because things don't get too brown. I have told all my friends that they should invest in this pan and they can without breaking the bank when purchasing it.
4,Early Scorps - The RCA Years,"As a big Scorpions fan i was very interested in hearing how they sounded before they hit it big. I had heard that their early stuff was as good or even better than the material released on the Mercury Label, i'm not sure that i'd agree with that comment, but this album does feature many solid songs including 3 live ones. Also, they seemed to have a bit more energy & faster riffs, largely due to Uli Roth, who is wicked at guitar! I would definately recommend this album, not just to the die-hard Scorps fan, but to any rock fan!I don't think it's necessary to buy all of their RCA albums, as long as you buy this and their first Best Of album. Some of the better songs on this Best of Vol. 2 are: ""Speedy's Coming"" (Live), ""They Need A Million"", ""Longing For Fire"", ""Top Of The Bill"", ""Catch Your Train"", ""Sun In My Hand"", ""Crying Days"", & ""We'll Burn The Sky"" (Live)"
3,good read,"This is my third book by Alan Topol and I enjoyed this one too. It was slightly predictable but no more then most books are. It was one that kept me interested in the characters and plot, which is something that Patterson books don't!!! With a little tweaking I would have given it fours stars."
2,The Only Disappointment,"I am a devoted fan of Judith and Renie and have read every one of the Bed and Breakfast books with the exception of Creeps Suzette (I'll get to it soon). I have to say that this is the ONLY book in the series I have not enjoyed. The plot was up to par with the usual twists, turns and colorful characters. However, I just felt that Judith and Renie weren't their usual selves. Renie was not nearly as fiesty as usual and her slobbering over Rover at one point is unbelievable if you remember in September Morn that she ""hates"" dogs!! As for Judith, this was the only time I found her to be insensitive, pushy, and irritating. If this had been written by anyone other than the exceptionally talented Ms. Daheim, I probably would have thought it was pretty darn good. I would be interested if any other devotees who have read the series feel the same way! Can't wait for SILVER SCREAM!!"
1,what would Christopher Lee like to tell his opinion?,"Dracula is described ill at the end of his day, he upchucks twice and brokes his own stomach cause he sucks the blood of non virgin maid. The role of Dracula & his acting are very weak, weak and weak. He cannot catch his own victims by himself.what happen, if Christopher Lee (the grandest Dracula Actor) sees the weak film like this? he said that he seems not so enthusiastic as he watched another variation of Dracula.Let's go to the old Hammer classic Movies with Christopher Lee as a Count."
4,"OK for the unit, should not be advertised as storage for the books and cartridges","The backpack itself is very well made. It holds the Powertouch unit beautifully. However, it should not be advertised as a backpack that can hold the unit AND the books. It does have storage space, tiny pockets, sewn in the front under the top flap for 4 cartridges, but where do the books go? I can stick 4 books in to the same pouch for the unit but it is stuffed and scratches the outside of the unit. My son has over 10 books/cartridges for the unit so this backpack does not help with complete storage. I would still purchase this pack again though because it is great for protecting the main unit and easier for him to carry from room to room than just the unit itself. But, be prepared to arrange storage for the books/cartridges elsewhere."
2,Beginnings,"This was truly the beginnings for Shania. Most of it sounds like just about any other ordinary singer...before she developed her unique style. The voice is still beautiful, but without any of her true depth & feeling."
5,beautiful!,"gave this as valentine gift to a boat lover, it is a wonderful gift to home addition and it looks beautiful and definatly worth the money."
1,how it work or not,"the machine worked well for about a mounth and than the rake that puts the ice in the bin broke . they sent a new rake ,then the pins broke this was about a mouth or2 later i had to gess how to put that on tray and all in .year later it will not make ice . when it worked it was nice made ice about every 7 to8 min nice while it worked at this point ill buy another kind of machine never a danby dim1524w again do not buy it you money will be gone and no ice in you bin!@#$%^&"
2,Not good if you store ice,"Wife purchased one of these recently and I am not thrilled with it. It does make ice and I like the shape and sizes but the ice is soft and doesn't hold up very well in a less than very cold drink. My main complaint is that the ice begins to melt as soon as it drops from the freezing posts and makes for rather wet ice. Not too much of a problem if you use the ice as soon as it is made but if you transfer the ice to your freezer, as I do, you end up with a frozen mass of ice that is made of individual ""cubes"" frozen together into a useless chunk."
3,For younger audiences,"I found the exercises and patronizing tone in most of the contributors' articles to be sophomoric and borderline juvenile. Only one or two of the exercises were helpful or interesting. I was hoping for some authorial expertise, and instead got a compendium of shopworn notes and examples from CW class teachers and students. My guess is the novice students who had their examples printed are the happiest purchasers of this flimsy book. It would be better to buy Jerome Stern's ""Shapes of Fiction"" or even Goldberg's ""Writing Down the Bones"" if you are a grown-up writer looking for some help."
3,OK,"Works fine. However, it has a lot of transformer hum, which is really annoying. Had purchased this unit to replace a similar one that had the same problem, but no improvement."
1,Just My Opinion,"The narrator was a bit much with his goofy laughing, and excessive drama. If you enjoy shows like Ghost Hunters, Ghost Lab, A Haunting (not ""Haunting""), etc. You probably will not think much of this show. If you're looking for a Halloween, lets scare the kids around the campfire - this will be fine. I found the narrator to be annoying at best!The choice is always yours."
2,I would stick with Garmin,Bought this unit to update my gps. Yes is has some great features as stated above. The con of this unit is it will not find a address in a gated community. It will give you an error that no route is available. If I knewthis I would never have purchased this unit. Garmin is a better more reliable unit.
3,A few little improvements and it would be great,"First, I agree with all the other reviews - it would be nice if there were more cases to solve. I got really caught up in the scenarios and they were well presented.I don't know whether I'm missing something but I also hated that if you want to repeat the game from the beginning (to improve your score, for example) you have to go through the tutorial which is really time consuming and boring and takes up half of the first case.The ""you can't use that here"" voice, that tells you when you're not using the appropriate tool is annoying after a while too. You kind of want to yell: ""shut up!"" Also, some of the tools that you ""can't"" use, could actually be used in a real crime scene so it really makes you realize how much of a simulation it is.Just know - there are no points for creativity in approach. Either you do it their way or it's wrong.Overall, a fun game though and I had a good time playing it."
2,"Too easy, over fast","I was looking forward to playing this game because I greatly enjoy the TV show. But like someone before me mentioned, it was too easy -- I finished playing it in about 4 hours. There are too many hints and the clues are blatantly placed (even if you aren't into the game and you just want to win, all you have to do is drag your mouse over various areas and wait for the mouse pointer to turn green, collect the clues, and then it all comes automaticaly together). Spoon fed.I do think, however, if it was too hard, people would get frustrated with it. But for fans of forensic shows, or even someone who has basic knowledge, this game is a breeze. Which is frustating in itself, because you play the game, anticipating it getting harder with each level, and that just doesn't happen.Hopefully if they make another version of this game, they'll take some time and think up more complex plots that require greater deduction in order to win."
2,Just OK,"The graphics are fair, the game-play is pretty linear, and the game doesn't last long. Though I usually like role-play/simulation games, this one struck me as a bit boring--you just click on everything to look for clues. I am a big CSI fan which is why I bought this game, but I was a bit disappointed."
3,What Now,"I do like the crime scene investigation,and i don't.I don't understand what i've got to do now,I'm stuck i did all the scenes now i'm up to where grissom goes missing i collected all the evidence asked everyone there Questions,and i can't do anything else.And i find this quite boring and ript off.Someone told me that you have to start all over again and get 100 points in all of them.If this is so i find it again quite boring to start from the beginning and do it all over again."
3,Fun but short,"This game was a lot of fun but it did not take to long to finish it! It was sometimes nice having the characters help you but they always were looking over your shoulder. If you did something out of order, they would tell you 'There is no prints here'. Also, if you looked over one piece of evidence you could not move one. And, you rarely got to analyze the evidence for yourself. Greg usually does it all except for finger prints. However, I liked how all the graphics were so realistic and the cast's voices."
4,GOOD GAME,It's a good game. There's a lot of cases. It's challangeing (O can't spell) and it's addicting.
2,"Too Short, Too Easy","First off, this game takes up to 1.5 gig of hard drive space, so make sure you have it. In the game you are an CSI intern watched over by one of the CSI cast members for each of the five missions. The cast member is just there for hints, and very, very basic ones at that. There is no interaction with them. You just go to a site, collect clues with the tools (some tools used only once in all the missions) and see where they lead you. When at a site, there are a limited number of clues, so you can either hunt for them, or drag you pointer across the screen until it turns green. There are only a few basic tools and nothing fancy or fun. Interaction with people is done with pre-selected questions, so you just click on every question to finish a person's interview. This game took me four hours to finish at the 90% level in all missions (no hints needed). They better have a cheap add-on soon, since the game is over way too quickly."
1,What A Letdown!,"To be honest I am absolutely shocked by the rave reviews given to thisbook by Amazon customers. I hated it, absolutely hated it!Let mesay I am a great fan of the author, having read most of her books. Iloved The Eleventh Hour and Searching for Sarah, but this book didabsolutely nothing for me.I found the plot unbelievable, thedialogue stilted and the ending PATHETIC. There seemed to be no realwarmth betwenn Ellie and Michael, none that I could feel anyway. Ithought the author revealed far too quickly into the story, who wasthe good and who was the bad guy, ruining the suspense of thestoryline - what suspense - I ask myself?I was so disappointed withthis book, it's not true, and was truly amazed when I came online togive my opinion of this awful book and saw all the five stars! Maybeit's because I'm English -I truly don't know."
3,"Loud, reliable, gets the job done.","Just like every other dehumidifier I have seen or used, this dehumidifier is just as loud. This thing has been keeping my 600 sq ft basement at 40% humidity for about 6 years now - basically it works."
2,Good when working.,"Purchased this at Home Depot. After the first year of use in my basement, the unit started icing up. After an hour the evaperator will be covered in ice. I then took the unit to the authorized Maytag repair center here in Dartmouth MA. The technician stated that the unit was fine and did not ice up for them. I then brought the unit home, ran it for a day and brought it back, (very heavy with ice), fully iced over. They then ran it the next day and stated that it will not ice up for them. I called Maytag but they were of no help. Repair center does not want it back since they can not figure out the problem and hint that it may be normal. According to my manual, this model will sense icing and disable the compressor and default to high blower speed to clear the ice. I guess thats what does not work on mine and I guess it can not be repaired. So much for the 5 year warranty."
1,Beware!,Great book. No problem there. BUT... This Kindle version is not a standard text formatted for Kindle. It's a .PDF looking picture of each of the pages and very frustrating to try and navigate and read.
2,Disappointing,"Paul Newman plays a burned-out private eye and Gene Hackman and Susan Sarandon are a movie-star couple with a long-buried dark secret. Too implausible, too many overdrawn secondary characters. A rental at best."
1,Not elegant at all,"I was very disappointed with this tray. I sent it back. the engraving is not refined at all, the borders are not elegant. Even the silverplating is not nice. My husband even thought it was just metal."
3,Not the best Kelis song,"Kelis's album ""Tasty"" is a great album full of sexy RnB songs, but Trick me is actually one of the weaker songs, I do see some appeal to it, but there are better songs Kelis could of released, I say pass on this one and get Kelis ""Tasty""."
4,WW2 naval mistake.,"Good reading, but a little slow at times. Seems the navy covered up a few faults of it's own. Hopefully this has been corrected for our brave troops in the future. The Captain took the heat and never complained even though he was not at fault. Would recommend to any naval personel looking for naval history."
5,light sci-fi/ fantasy here.... don't pass it up.,"This book was a pleasant surprise. Although it is a wee-bit fantasy/science fiction, don't let that stop you from reading it. I just wish the author would put out more, or perhaps continue the story in other books. Please do so Karen Hancock."
4,Sad it's out of print,"I stumbled across this book on either a MySpace or Facebook book forum. Someone reeling in the post-Twilight saga haze had recommended it as a good and enticing read. It did not disappoint.I really enjoyed the allegory and symbolism of Arena, as well as its SciFi edge. The most striking allegory in the book is taking the ""easy path"" vs. the ""right path."" Temptations, pride and evil abound in the Arena--interweaving the spiritual world with the physical.I very much enjoyed the storyline and plot devices, however, I did wish there was a bit more character development. For the protagonist, Callie--we only know of one or two events that took place prior to the Arena, for Pierce (her love interest), even less. I believe it would only help to further the story if we cared about these two characters slightly more.But in all, a thought provoking and intelligent read. A must for anyone who is a Science Fiction and Christian Lit fan."
4,Works for curious babies too,"I use this gate to keep my very active, very determined one year old granddaughter out of the boo-booville kitchen while I babysit her during the day. When she goes home at night, the gate comes down then goes up the next day with minimal effort and no damage to the wood door sills.Very useful and very affordable."
1,Not for mid sized dogs,"I bought this in order to keep my dog out, a bulldog that weighs 55 lbs. We had a previous gate that worked just fine as he knew that if there was something in front of him, he knew that he was not meant to go through it. Well with this one, he just walks right into it and the gate just falls over. With a smaller dog, maybe it could work but even when placed in the door frame, I was expecting a gust of wind to blow it down. Taking it out of the package, I just knew it was not going to work as I wanted it too as the gate felt so cheap, so wobbly. I understand that people buy this model as a cheap alternative to a real gate, but save your money and just upgrade to another model. Save yourself the headache. It could be useful for ferrets though."
2,Gates come apart easily,"I have several brand of gates of this sliding variety, and this is the only one where the 2 ""sides"" come apart from each other entirely. It's as if the metal brackets are not fitted correctly (or not the right size), because depending on how you slide the sides, the 2 pieces come completely off the track. This also happens if someone takes the gate down and stores it on its ""side."" It works fine and looks fine if you handle with care, but I would not purchase this particular brand again."
5,Loraine,"The gate works great and is so pretty, I did not expect it to look so nice, and you can see through the inserts. Great. I am very happy with it."
2,Get what you pay for . . .,This gate was so cheap I should have known it was too good to be true. I was hoping to use this to block off the fireplace opening from my soon to be crawling baby (we never use the fireplace so no worry about the plastic on the gate). This gate has very limited ability to adjust at the pressure points and I was unable to get it to fit in the space that I needed. I then tried the gate in our kitchen doorway thinking I would keep it if it fit there. Again this gate would not fit in any of the positions available for what I consider to be a pretty standard doorway size. On top of the inability to get this gate to fit it's kind of cheap looking and the wood frame doesn't seem very sturdy. I guess you get what you pay for - lesson learned and I'm now returning this gate and will continue to look for a solution for our fireplace opening.
4,Classic Metal,"A great album from a great British Heavy Metal Band,the first wave.They don't get as much as credit as their peers,like Deep Purple or Led Zeppelin,but in some ways(as this album shows),they were just as good or better than them in some ways.A very prog oriented album,but like the two previous,they mix up the styles.If you like heavy keyboards,and slick guitars,this CD is for you.This is the first album that they sounded really tight as a preforming group.and deserve credit with a revolving rhythm section.And if you like classic rock,you can't go wrong with this CD."
2,Jammed in printer; labels didn't stay on all day,"Normally I am very pleased with Avery products, but these didn't meet my expectations. I had to feed these sheets into my high-volume laser printer individually; putting a stack of about 10 on the printer tray caused jams on two separate occasions.The labels stayed on a lot of fabrics and didn't curl too much but after a full day a lot of people had lost theirs. I had to press mine back onto my shirt several times during the day to prevent it from falling off. That said, these stayed on better than the OfficeMax labels I had tried previously. Might be time to invest in plastic badge hangers."
4,Beautiful...once they got here!,"I ordered two of these for my room. They are considered to be nursery furniture but work well in any room. Very solid and heavy with metal rails. Only problem was with the company they use for delivery. Took many phone calls for them to even find my order, and once they did, they scheduled a delivery and didn't show. I called again and they said they had no record of me. They conveniently said they were supposed to deliver the next day, as if I was mistaken. I was not available that day so I know I didn't schedule the delivery that day. After reading reviews, it sounds like I was lucky to get the dressers only a week late, rather than months like some people reported. I love the dressers and would recommend them, but the company delivering them were a bit of a hassle."
4,"Very cool, sort of.","This camera is very cool, although I wish I had ordered the one that takes a series of photos instead. This one takes all the photos at one time so there is no movement, it is just blah. I got some really neat shots with it though so I can't really complain too much. Everyone always loves how cool the gold looks, I kind of wish I could get a regular camera with this much BLING!! I guess the only thing I don't like about the Lomography cameras is that they are not all that practical. I think it would be good if you could alternate between 9 lenses and 1 lens. Then you could have more options with the same roll of film. All in all this is pretty great, just uncomfortably basic for me."
4,consise data,"I thought it gave instruction for each repair so they were understandable. I think the work was worthwhile for the beginner or , intermediate person."
3,Backlight is too weak,"The clock works well but the backlight is not strong enough to see the time at night (I have normal vision). If you don't need that, it's fine. If you do, buy something else."
4,"Some flaws, good clock","I bought this to use as a medication timer. For that purpose, assuming you don't have to take medication more than twice a day (it has two alarms), it works well.Page 10 of the manual incorrectly states that the alarms only activate Monday to Friday, but they work on weekends as well.The LCD is such that it's somewhat dim when viewed straight on, and even dimmer when viewed from below; you get a clear view from above.It emits a quiet high pitched squeal when the nightlight button is pressed.It's necessary to push the buttons firmly.It uses a single AAA battery, which I find convenient since they're easy to find and relatively inexpensive."
3,classic male schavenist humor,"i was a fan of this A-HOLE in high school, when my head was up my @ss and i didn't care about anybody or anything but myself!!! everything this jewish madman did to get himself blacklisted he eventually deserved! the only product i still have by him is ford fairlane.even his shows ""bless this house"" and ""hits"" got canned so quickly as to make his wife ""trinny"" leave him and his own head spin. now he is a vegas late night side-show freak married to a brown chick named maria!even his vh1 program from 2006 called dice rules only lasted one season and i missed the final episode featuring artie lange because i was a carlos ""mind of"" mencia fanatic! hell, i still own ""those"" dvds!how many people realize this jerk, ripped-off same kinisons persona?andrew ""diceman"" clay (aka andrew silverstein) lost his fans do to his never apologize attitude."
1,How can I buy an item if I do not know the size?,How can I be expected to buy this item if it is insufficiently described? My wife has a very old 6x9 3-ring recipe binder that broke. She has pages full of recipes she wants to transfer to a new binder and wants to be able to add new recipes to it. But without telling me the size of the binder or the size of the additional available pages I cannot tell if it suits our needs.Very poorly/incompletely written.
1,Its too fast,"I brought this clock considering the lengendary sony trademark. But it turned out to be a complete disappointment. Its gaining hours and I am about to return in today. Well,the display is not so bright. If you are looking for a good bedside alarm clock with radio, please don't go for this one."
2,Looks Great but makes buzzing sound when OFF!,I liked everything about this clock except that it makes a buzzing sound when it's OFF. I think it's the internal transformer. When you squeeze the clock it stops for a few minutes. It's very annoying. At first I thought the radio wouldn't turn off or something. Sorry this cancels out anything good I'd have to say about it. What good is a clock that keeps you AWAKE?
3,Don't buy for the radio.,"I like the clock, with an adjustable display that is even larger than it appears from the picture. The alarm and time-setting controls on the front are simple and intuitive. But the radio is barely usable, with small cheap plastic dials, poor discrimination between nearby stations, and a high shrill sound that is hard to listen to even for talkradio."
1,Risk-que,"This product didn't work in any of the outlets in my house. I've read another review of the happening, and my advice is to find something else."
1,Invisable Large Display,"When adjusted for maximum brightness, the time display on this unit is so dim it is difficult to read from across the room unless it's night and all the lights are out. It's truly a dream machine. You can't see it if you're awake."
4,Digital clock,The numbers on the clock are not bright enough to see in the day light I wish they were brighter and bigger.
1,Great brightness control !,"Finally I have found a digital clock that has a full range of variable brightness levels. A dial allows you to change continuously from bright to invisible. MUCH better than the typical High/Low switch. But, the level we find comfortable at night makes the clock virtually unreadable during the day, unless you want to fiddle with the control every day. Have not tried other features, but it seems to have all the goodies you would want."
1,Not useful,"I bought this 2 weeks ago. Now the time lags behind ( i.e clock is 10 seconds slower every minute.)Got it from US to India, not sure if anybody can service this.Atleast for me this was a huge disappointment since I believed in the name ""Sony'. Also I can not return it at the moment."
1,This clock doesn't keep time,I'm very disappointed with this clock. It does not keep correct time. From the very first day it lost at least 1 minute per day. By the end of the week it is 7-8 minutes slow. What good is a clock that can't keep correct time? This purchase was a complete waste of money!
4,Deanna's Review,"I replaced our old Sony AM/FM Clock radio (it finally broke after 41 years)I am pleased with our new one so far. The tone is not bad .....clock is easy to read ...... I read some of your reviews on this item, and several of them complained that the digital clock was too dim to read in the daytime. Sony must have changed that because mine is very easy to read. I am pleased with the clarity of voices on talk radio. I also like the small size. It takes up very little space on my night stand."
3,Not great radio reception,"The big display is nice. But my main complaints are 1) the radio does not get good reception. I can't get NPR, which is why I wanted a clock radio in the first place. 2) I can never seem to find the snooze button in a half-asleep state. I always push the time set buttons and wonder why the alarm is not turning off."
1,never received shipment,Sony ICF-C492 Large Display AM/FM Clock RadioThe item ordered was lost by UPS and never delivered. The company ordered from has not responded to my inquiry about tracking the lost item. I have no reveiw of the radio as I never received it!
3,Not the correct size,"Not a bad product just not the right size. Maybe list on the packaging, which holder size best fits the inserts. Was a bit nervous that they wouldn't arrive on time but they did."
4,Name Badge Inserts,This fufilled our expectations. Service was timely. We were very satisfied with the product and the price. Will order again when needed.
1,Technocel Car Charger (SCP4900) - Substandard,I received this product and it worked for about 2 days. Then Amazon was wonderful and replaced it right away. The replacement worked about 5 days longer than the first one. Amazon was great to stand behind the product and give me a full refund. Steer clear of this product - it is substandard !!
3,Short coil cord fix,"The coil cord is too short but just grab the cord in each hand where the cord goes from straight to coil and pull on the coil part slowly and firmly. Do not allow the power jack at either end to be pulled / strained. After about 10 ""stretches"" the cord will be somewhat longer and more functional."
4,speedys coming... to rock.,This was the second hard rock scorpions release. the first is the more psyh rock flavored 'lonesome crow'. This one is more accessible and has the classic song 'speedys coming'. The rest are more hendrix inspired and the band had yet to get it's true bearings. The next release would see that change into a fully modern metal style that was the scorpions own. Gone would be the long psych rockers like 'fly to the rainbow' and instead the hot guitar driven sounds of what would really be modern metal would come to the fore. This is still good early metal though and a must for any scorps fan. Casual fans who are not psych rock fans might enjoy the groups catalog after this one though. But if you give it a chance you will find a great cd of well crafted and sung songs in the early metal / early 1970's style of hard rock.
5,Mindblowing,"An absolute classic from Scorpions. Meine, Roth, Buchholz are all amazing on this album.I grewup listening this and other Scorpions albums of that era, 20 years later it sounds just as fresh. Also check check out Tokyo Tapes... what I woundn't do for the live footage of this!"
3,Early works,"Probably the best of the Scorpions earliest works, just the right amount of psychedelic influences from Uli Jon Roth.I too, need a million...."
4,Nice idea,This is really a good product. The caribinger is the key. However I bought it for my magna cart and the way the magna cart is made the caribinger was not large enough. I however kept it to work with my other cart and it works beautifully. You don't have to worry about the cord popping or coming out.
5,Great recipes,I just purchased the Ronco Showtime Rotisserie and this book it helpful. It gives good ideas as to what to cook.
2,Problem with Book,"This book has excellent recipes. However, Ms Phillips does not address the oven temperature for any of the recipes only the cook time.Jeff S"
4,"Informative, Gripping, Graphic, True","Fastidiously researched, well-documented, and equally well-written, this book is probably the final word, not only on the Texas Rangers, but on certain epochs of Texas history. This is the book that we`ve been waiting for - the kind that evokes the human side of the Rangers without destroying their larger-than-life reputation, and one that makes them live up to their sins without minimizing their heroism. This combines equal parts fact and testosterone to make for a satisfying read that, although it does drag occasionally, quite makes up for it with a steady stream of colorful events and individuals on every page.- Benjamin Gene Gardner"
4,Just like a history flows in the river of novel.,"This is the first Texas Ranger book that give me a strong impression of the Texan heritage. Remarkable, the way the author tells the story, flows like a river. You won't stop easily from reading this book."
5,great pro guitars,this guitar is really nice sounds nice the strings on it are slightly to stretchy so you can here a string buzz some time but thats cheap to replace the pick ups are good and it stays in tune pretty good adventurliy i would replace the tuners and strap buttons and pickups to an enclosed pick up all in gold tone once done it would be perfect but as is its high quality and great and it arived on expected date
3,Wrong color,The guitar itself is nice but I wish someone would've taken a non stock photo. There's no wood grain and it has a flat finish almost purple colored.
2,Purely for beginners only,"On the plus side, this guitar is inexpensive. On the minus side, the pickups are very noisy, the tuners are loose and don't hold tuning, and the body construction is such that if you put any weight on the body while holding the neck, the tuning goes sharp.If you're short/small and always play sitting down, this might be an OK value. For anyone else, avoid it."
2,Overwrought bit of fluff,"You know for a personal insider account of Iraq during the American Occupation, I'd expect a little more than a series of sound bites and political articles about the bad bad things that America has done to Iraq. This ""blog"" is too ready to condemn America and too smug to really be genuine. Where does this woman eat? What does she like to buy? Does she watch television? Movies? Does she have any friends?None of these questions are answered because this is not a real person writing. This is a series of anti-war essays about how America is wrong about everything. It's out to convince the anti-war folks that they are correct in their condemnation and annoy the folks that supported the war in the first place. Pretty light stuff."
1,Poor Little Rich Girl,"Riverbend and her Sunni family are from a previleged class in Baghdad. She now laments for her family's lost power and fortune. Riverbend anquishes over the sporatic supply of water when it is her own Sunni compatriots that blow up the water supplies. She complains that the electricity is only availabe a few hours a day. It is her friends that repeatedly blow up the transmission lines. She also complains of the ""uniformed"" people that recently assassinated a Sunni cleric and his two sons. She neglects to mention that the assassins are also Sunni, wearing uniforms taken from murdered police. The cleric was killed for cooperating with the coaltion forces (she calls the Americans the occupation).Riverbend would have been shot if she had opposed Saddam's regime. In this new government, she is allowed to say what she wants. This is called biting the hand that feeds you.It is time for Riverbend to grow up."
5,Grunge Collection,I ordered this as being a part of my little grunge collection. I've never played it. This single has some of my favorite Nirvana artwork.
5,Best Monitor Around,"I recently purchased this monitor to replace the monitor that came with my gateway computer. My old monitor had a LOT of distortion, so I figured it was time to replace it.This monitor is BIG. The color is amazing, and the brightness/contrast settings are phenomenal. You can go from so bright you look like you're George Bush to so dark that....well....it's...really dark. You get the idea.Pros:HUGEGreat Color/ClarityNo distortionColor is distrubuted evenly, meaning there's no corners that are lighter than others.Range of brightness/contrast settingsCons:Mine came with one dead pixel, but that was so easy to fix it's not even funny. Turned it off, put pressure on it (cloth and a blunt sharpie end behind it, turned it back on, and it was gone.I had a little bit of trouble getting the blue cable attached, but that's just my impatience.This is a great monitor, I LOVE it. If you're having any second thoughts about buying this monitor, or are even considering it, buy it!"
1,It's blurry,"Don't buy this!!1. Uneven illumination - it's most noticeable at boot-up time when the entire screen is grey -- the corners are a different shade from the center of the screen.2. It has a ""focus"" option. But no matter how you adjust it, you can't get everything sharp. If the left of the screen is sharp, then the right is smeared and vice-versa. This is especially noticeable with text.3. External power supply. This is common, but not necessary, in my opinion. It's lazy design, I think. I'm going to send it back,"
4,from someone older than most,"At 37 and 225lbs a skateboard wasn't exactly my doctor's (or spouses) idea of fitness equipment, but I was tired of the gym (I'd already dropped 60 pounds). The first thing I had to do was to tighten the trucks (for obvious reasons) and get used to two new 'improvements' to skateboards in the fifteen years I've been off them, the lack of a skid-plate and the presence of upwards curves to the sides. The transition wasn't difficult at all, I've been cruising on it for about a month, hitting ramps and hopping from time-to-time and I've found it holds up from the parking lot to the church's fellowship hall floor. I will probably invest in larger wheels at some point, but for now it does everything I ask of it..."
5,Very catchy tunes on this Debut,"These guys have a really tight post-modern rock sound. Their songs have chord changes and bridges that, while only subtly different, add texture to the traditional rock and roll format. At least 3 of them share lead vocal duty (like the Beatles!) and the effect is positive - it adds depth to the overall album. Even their use of keyboards (which I usually can't stand) is tasty. Definitely worth a listen."
3,Pretty Good,"I ordered this book having at least three months to study. I must say the book reviews a lot but it does fall short in some areas. It would of been a whole lot better if they would of explained the answers to the Practice Test at the end. They did provide explanations to the practice problems but not to the Big Practice Exam they have at the end, though they did provide the answers. The positives about the book is that its exactly like the exam. You get familiar with the way the questions are asked and that was a real plus when i took the test. It was as if i knew where the questions were heading.Best one out there though."
3,Poor LCD,I for one think this is a gorgeous looking clock radio. I can't help but feel Sony took some cues from the ipod when designing the exoskeleton.My disappointment would be the abysmal LCD. You can barely read it head-on. You'd have to view it from a bird's viewpoint for the digits to be legible. I doubt it'll be legible from afar either. I've seen other clocks with a similar LCD and it fairs much better even with the illumination turned down.
1,Style yes. Functional no.,The clock was in use for 33 days and then it died. The display output dimmed and the radio and light functions all stopped working.I have a Sony clock radio from the 70's that still works. I'm sorry to see the quality tail off like this.
5,Holy jesus...,"This is some disturbing stuff right here man... I know bands that are truly dark and haunting but embalmer--woah! I love very song here and yes it gives me the chills and not band yet has done that except for somet exhumed,brujaria,,mortician and early stuff from cryptopsy! Buy it!"
2,Pretty but a bit staid for my taste,"This topic is a favorite of mine and suits my style, but I am disappointed in this book which, although pretty, is rather dull. The first book I saw on the subject was also called Garden Style Decorating, I believe, but it was by Better Homes and Gardens. The Better Homes and Gardens book has a fresher look and a wider variety of styles."
1,Garbage !!!,"What else would you expect from a ""Born-Again"" Christian... This book takes factual items out of context in Freemasonry. It's just the Christian Right's distorted ""spin"" of an honorable Fraternal organization. One which has been misunderstood and attacked many times in this and other countries. Many poeple forget that Freemasonry was instrumental in the Formation of this country. So much so that this country uses many Masonic instruments on a daily basis, such as a gavel in a court of law. This honorable orginazation has existed for hundreds of years, and will continue to do so. God Willing..."
1,a Madea Christmas (the play),"this is Tyler Perry s worst ever. when you are used to movies that can make you laugh and cry, then here comes a play. i was very disappointed. i donated this to a charity, consider the money i spent on this as the conrtibution. i will be leery of any other Tyler Perry Studio releases. definately not worth the money."
3,"Not his best, but funny.",This wasn't Tyler 's best However it was still funny. There are some characters that should have been in the play.
4,A Madea Christmas,"I liked the play and the message. If I had to compare it to Laugh, I enjoyed Laugh more due to the inspirational songs."
3,A Madea Christmas,It was good but I wish there was more Madea. I found myself fast fowarding to her parts and wishing to see more of Madea and less of almost everyone else except Aunt Bam.
5,Exceptional!,I love this play! It has a twist to it and makes it much more interesting! I love the singing the entire cast is spot on. Every time I see a Tyler Perry play I can relate and that is a great thing. Keep doing your thing Tyler it is much appreciated.
2,usually love all...,"I usually love all of Tyler Perrys movies, but this one had a lot of sassy talking smark comments of some new character. I enjoyed the music at the beginning more so, not for the kids and the humor was few and far between for me. Only one part actually made me laugh in this play and that was when Madea knocked over things before she left."
5,A Madea Christmas,"This DVD was purchase as a gift. The package arrived early and was packaged securely. Thanks for the prompt, excellent service."
2,Play,I didn't like to watch it in a Play form. I would prefer to watch it in the form of a movie.I do like Tyler Perry's films. But I didn't care for this.
3,Somebody please beat this guy up!,"I got this after I saw Iggy perform ""Mask"" live on Letterman last summer. Unfortunately, that's the only real rocker on the album, which on the whole is rather depressing. Iggy seems out of touch with the music world, as most of this material sounds corny and could easily have been recorded in the early 90's. The only thing that keeps this from being a complete bomb is the fact that a real maniac is singing the songs, but if you want to hear Iggy angry and yelling, try the old Stooges stuff instead. Iggy either needs to go back to his classic material, catch up with the times, or just stop recording."
5,Iggy's back,"What a great cd. Iggy said he wanted to make another ""Raw Power"" which I don't think is possible, but he came as close as possible. This time, he has more metallic riffs. Great for first time Iggy listeners."
3,Where Did This Kind Of Music Go????,"I remember first hearing Vangelis' ""Heaven & Hell"" back in high school, and getting creeped out by the haunting Hell passages on the record and loving it. Having Jon Anderson as a guest vocalist only enhanced the record. A couple years ago I found this cd in a bargain bin at my local record store and picked it up. I still pull it out every now again (for some reason I really dig listening to this in the Fall season). It's a shame that music like this and artists like Rick Wakeman, Brian Eno and others, isn't still being made, instead the 80's & 90's came along, Prog-Rock gave way to New Age, you had Yanni and John Tesh take over the instrumental scene and water it down to elevator pap. It's a shame that music has to be pidgenholed into such confining catagories, and most folks are left unaware of all that is out there."
3,Minor Ups and Downs,"I suppose that with a title like HEAVEN AND HELL, one should expect some ups and down. I did in terms of enjoyment and in terms of interest.I am not a stranger to long pieces. I like classical music. I got turned on to Mike Oldfield in 1979. I even remember having a Vangelis 8 track back then but I don't remember what it was called. Vangelis too, seems to specialize in long, symphonic type compositions. With any such long work, though, the artist is bound to hit ups and downs in terms of interest. This one certainly does but the ups are not very far up.Criticism aside, the artist is effective at capturing his ""theme"". He manages to portray, musically, the tension between good and evil. There are even a few delightful tidbits in which they might be confused for a few brief moments.This will appeal mostly to those who like electronica. I do, sometimes. I am willing to give him another try sometime but he is not at the top of my list."
3,Not bad,"This was an exciting book about a young professional couple with fast-paced careers in NYC. This book is primarily about Nora and Jeff Montgomery and their mutual friend Hilton. But there is also some side drama concerning their parents and a scandalous neighbor. Though I liked the book overall, it felt like some of the characters were underdeveloped. Jeff's mother is an insufferable snob who never wanted her son to marry the daughter of a couple of Haitian immigrants. Their mysterious neighbor Olivia is also very haughty and looks down on Nora because she thinks that she is materialistic and superficial. And we know very little about the Deschamps, Nora's parents. They are not major characters, but a little more depth would have been useful in helping the reader to understand their behavior.Other than that minor criticism, I enjoyed this book."
4,Jazzmasters V,Classic Jazzmasters! Good CD. Paul Hardcastle's music always evokes thoughts of carefree summers!
4,Great Jazz Instrumental/ Vocal CD!,"A combination of Smooth Jazz, chilled ambient vibes and relaxing grooves. This is what makes Paul Hardcastle music so inviting. This CD will transport you to a super relaxed atmosphere. Very high quality music! Cool atmospheric beats and sensual Smooth Jazz phrases that come together.All of the instruments flow elegantly together to create this latest collection of tasty songs that offer a fusion of musical flavors. Compelling and vibrant! Great seductive CD / Album cover sets the mood and tone to entice the listener!"
4,Jazzmasters Newbie,"I'm a relative newbie to the Jazzmasters music but I know what I like and I like this album very much. When listening to a disc and you think ""Wow...it's 'over' already!"" I realize what a pleasant experience it is."
3,Not very good,The four CD before this are very good. I have them this is two steps down. Not very good.
3,mbg,The product arrived as expected and I love this set to give as gifts. I was a bit dissappointed in the gift wrapping that I paid for as it was not done very nicely. Just wrapping paper and no ribbon or bow. Had to re-wrap the gift to make it look better as a gift.Mary
5,in love with the process,"I'm not a sailor but this book (a gift) has charmed me. Somehow, the boat, the man, his family, his tribulations and the art of navigation are so artfully described that I have become enamoured of all of the above! Anyone who has ever been seasick or obsessed with completing a project will find themselves turning pages here. . ."
4,Home Town Girl,"My childhood WAS Cisco, Texas and I had heard this story all of my life, as well as, seeing all the displays at the bank. I visited there shortly after the book was first published, fully expecting every store in town to have copies for sale. What a shock - not one store had the book for sale and I was told not one store planned to sell it, that I might find it in Abilene. My older brother purchased a copy in the Dallas area for our mother and me. My Mother read part of it and quit. I read it - laughing all the way - not only for the bungled robbery and aftermath - but, realizing the language had made it a 'no-no' for my Mother and my hometown. Oh yes - it is a great read."
2,Little Bailey Doll,"The doll is adorable. Very cute and looks just like my Granddaughter when she was about 5 mos old. That being said, the doll is not cuddly at all. The body is oddly lumpy and the neck, feet and hands are stiff hard and are stitched rather obviously to the torso which is kind of a beanbag sort of construction. I think the doll is cute, but probably would not have purchased it if I had the opportunity to handle it before buying.I think all baby dolls should be cuddly for the little children who they are meant for. I didn't return it. Not enough time and being housebound, shopping the stores was not an option. My Granddaughter likes the doll and it is part of her trove.For cuteness, 5 stars for cuddling and loveabilty 1.5-2 stars.Service from the seller was very good and prompt 5 stars"
2,Not comparable to the broadway recording,"The performances are adequate, in some cases skillful, but from the opening note of the show (which the chorus member, in a misguided attempt at humor, aborts in order to insert a racous throat-clearing), this recording lacks the taste and dignity of its Broadway counterpart. I do not recommend this recording."
2,Very little suspense or intensity in these stories,"This collection of ghost stories is in no way riveting, they are presented more in a matter-of-fact rather than as something to rattle your bones. The second one describes a male traveler masquerading as a woman who has a ghostly hand and is the best of the group. When the traveler uses the powers of the severed hand to keep the men of the inn stupefied, the maid keeps her wits and locks him out until the spell can be broken. There are nineteen entries, some of which are short verse.There are many collections of ghost stories for young children and this is not one of the better ones. At times, it was a struggle to read them, as there was little action or suspense."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this and I've got the July issue but the September issue is already on the newstand. You are always 2 issues behind the newstand. What a ripoff! They must buy the bulk leftover unsold newstand magazines and ship them third class to have them arrive so late. Go to the newstand if you want it. There is absolutely no customer service to complain to either. They won't give you an email or a phone number.
3,Makes me hungry for a submarine sandwich,"50s movie about a submarine crew that meets a large octopus like puppet living in a flying saucer who wants to take over the world. Alien creature can read minds but cannot read that the movie hero was going to shoot him. One scene has a sub worker screaming for his shipmate to rescue him from certain death. Shipmate hears his cries and slowly wanders over to see what the problem is. Wandering shipmate gets stuck in a thin rubber door that closes on him so he also dies. Flying saucer can hop from galaxy to galaxy but cannot outrun a slow missle launched from a submarine. Wooden acting, cliche filled script but still great fun!"
3,Decent studio collection but I think I got gypped.,"i like this album but i only have songs 1 to 7 on my cd, which looks different on this page. perhaps the waldenbook people should go into more detail about their products.anyway, yes, i like this offering (although) a short offering, i like it none the less.there's like 1 or 2 songs that are on diabolical conquest which i think is the next (3rd) album after this and the version on this album is much better."
5,Awesome,"I love this conditioner. It leaves my hair very soft, yet clean and easy to style--not weighted down or greasy. Use with Bumble and Bumble Super Rich Shampoo for best results."
2,"Rent ""The Hunt for Red October"" Instead","""Das Boot"" was way too long. It's over three hours long and the director's cut contains many scenes that should have been left on the cutting room floor. Also, the disc must be flipped to see the entire movie. The English dub was good, however. And the 5.1 Dolby Digital did sound good."
1,Das Boot,"The first side of the DVD is in English, the second side in German. I wasn't aware of this feature when I ordered the DVD."
3,"Great Movie, Unworthy DVD","""Das Boot"" is probably the best and most honest World War II submarine movie ever made.I do have some quibbles with the DVD, however.I began watching it with English sound and English captions. But it was hard to follow because the words on the screen often differed drastically from the words being spoken. Whoever did the English captions probably didn't use the English version of the movie. My guess is that the captions were translated directly from the German soundtrack.I ended up watching the movie with German sound and English captions.Secondly, the ""Making of Das Boot"" item in the Special Features menu leaves much to be desired. Compared to the ""Making of"" features on the DVD versions of ""American Graffiti"" and ""1941"" it's woefully lacking.I was hoping for a shot of a bird landing on the U-boat miniature, or at least a modicum of detail on the genesis, casting and production of the movie."
5,DAS BOOT,"This is one GREAT WW2 FILM. If you are interested in WW2 Films, this is the one to have. I love WW2 films and this is one of my favorites. It is thrilling and full of suspense and action."
4,Das Boot,"This is a splendid film. It is gripping and tense through out. I have only one complaint - DO NOT WATCH IT WITH A GERMAN IN THE ROOM! My other half is German and so we watched it in the original German, with English subtitles. Every two minutes ""That's not what he said!"", ""That had nothing to do with what he actually said!)... and on and on. And the English language version - OH MY GOD! They seem to have been dubbed by cartoon characters! Despite all this don't be put off - you will love this film and the above annoyances are easily ignored when you get into it.Oh and one final thing - the director's commentary? Just say no."
2,A low point of german cinema,"forget what the last review said, consdiering this film came out in the post Tin Drum, Berlin Alexander Platz and Agurrie the Wrath of God ear odf german cinema, it is a ture low point of any cinmea in any era. Based on the stanards of the above films it is a conventioal action film , whit hokey dialouge and repitive scenes, peterson is no wirter and no director. dejavu takes over after about twenty minutes when scenes are palyed over and over again( whit remiscancent dialouge as well) Sure this film is on par with any america film becuaes most american films are carp wate of time. No true brillance is shown here , only the conventonal war film with no real philosocial or any over overtones for that matter"
4,Das Boot,The best U-boat movie ever made. U-571 should be ashamed for stealing material and even dialog from this film. My only problem is with the dubbed version. The subtitled version is 100% better. Who wants to watch German soldiers speaking in English with French accents? Try to see this movie subtitled if you can.
4,A really long damage control flick... and so much more,"I dug it. There pre-deployment party was the best scene. I've actually been to parties like that! I will have to say, when I first saw the move (in the theator) that scene alone, signaled that this movie was going to be good, no Hollywood junk but a good rendition of a U-boat in WWII, under hard conditions. It portrayed the circumstances very acurately. I've been on quite a few older ships, sailing around the western pacific, so the life-at-sea conditions were well done. The director went to painstaking detail in bringing us an excellent rendition of the times. Bravo!"
1,DAS BOOT DVD,"I bought it because this version had Closed Captions in English. But, the Closed Captions verbiage did not match the actual spoken English in the dvd, so it became a joke to follow the movie."
5,"ultimate ""Das Boot""","The blue-ray version of the director's cut was excellent, from picture quality to the soundtrack. When I saw that the original theatrical release version was included, I was especially pleased. This is still probably the best film ever made about submarine warfare during the Battle of the North Atlantic, and stands as a testament to the courage of the sailors of both sides of the conflict, the sufferings and sacrifices and the tragedies that marked that dark era. Peterson should do a film on the Royal Navy's side of the war before he passes from the stage........"
5,Best Sub Movie,"This is the best submarine movie made. More realistic than the clean U S sub movies. The sub is cramped, dirty, smelly. The crew is terrified. Depth charges don't make their day."
5,Great movie!,"Been many years since I have seen it but still as good as when it came out in the early 80s. Excellent movie.Pretty good special effects and Very good ""Feel"" of what life might have been inside a UBoat."
5,A DVD Review,"One of the best restorations of an older film around. All great movies 20+ years old should be redone this well. The sound was re-taped to 8 tracks and the extra footage, over an hour, was seamless. The documentary was only 6 minutes long and was more of a trailer for the restored Director's Cut version. The commentary is very good with the director commenting on the film plus you get Jürgen Prochnow, the Captain, commenting on his experience making the film and the producer of the restored version commenting on the restoration process. You learn some really interesting stuff about the actors, locations and other fascinating facts about this film that was over a year in production. A great DVD to add to any collection."
5,"Excellent history, excellent video transfer and Sound",It's a great movie and you'll realy enjoy the power of Dolby Digital 5.
3,Too Bad the Director Didnt Cut the Soundtrack,"The soundtrack sounded like a four-year-old was playing it on his keyboard. I am definetely an opponent of film scores, and the ambient music that already existed in the film stood very well on its own. The score aside though, it was an excellent film, if only for the sheer fact it manages to run over three hours long and never get slow. Highly reccomended to war-film fans, reccomended to all film fans when you can't find your favorite movie."
4,Great submarine movie but be ready for the sub-titles,Bought the DVD after enjoying the video of Das Boot. My only disappointment was I never figured out a way to get the English language to come on. (It looks to me the DVD doesn't have that option) So I end up listening to it in German with the sub-titles running at the bottom of te screen. Having to constantly read the sub-titles makes it a little less enjoyable to watch but this is definitely the classic WW II submarine movie of all time.
4,Das Boot Director's Cut - Too long????? No!!! Too short!!!...,"No doubt! ""Das Boot"" is definitive the best Anti-war film ever made.The only disappointment is the length. (That's why I only can give it 4 stars)I watched the DVD and I must say, I could feel the cuts. The DVD concentrates too much on the action-parts and the english dubbing really doesn't bring it.I don't say the DVD is bad! There's only a lot of story missing.For those who don't know; there are 3 different versions:1. The original film made for TV (in 6 Parts) with a total time of over 6 hours.2. The 120 minute cinema-version3. The Director's Cut with around 180 minutes.If you have the chance to get your hands on the 6 hours version, get it instead! Watch it in german (with subtitle if you really have to). It has a lot more ""Depth"" than the ""Director's Cut""."
1,I just did not like this book,"I was looking forward to a real spy thriller here but all I got was a couple paragraphs of the spy plot in between pages of Anastasia and Lucas both having daydreams of of each other, or Anastasia bemoaning that she wasn't good enough to do the Job or Anastasia bemoaning the fact that she was being unfaithful to her dead husband(and even with all that you know who the spy is right off.) Lady Anastasia was without any backbone or self confidence, she was just too wishy, washy and weak for me. I like stronger heroines. And I hated the constant comparison between Lucas and her dead husband, it got old. I made it three quarters of the way through the book and I just couldn't take any more and I never had any desire to finish it. The book went in the box to donate to my local library. It might be more someone else's cup of tea."
4,An overdose of bad luck,"Don't try to see anything logical in that film. It is just a big joke. Some women are like that. All men die around them, kill themselves, kille one another, in one word drop dead. That girl is that type. And she is as innocent as a newborn babe, and yet we will never know who was guilty first, who lied first, who put the poison out first, who overdosed who first, who was cut up into pieces first, who was buried in concrete first, who was drowned first, if any, in one word a real slaughter on a completely deserted island. But how does she manage to attract so many flies to her honeypie ?Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Université Paris Dauphine, Université Paris I Panthéon Sorbonne"
3,"okay, not great","We used Petrodex toothpaste every other day for a year on our two cats, in conjunction with CET oral rinse. Only mild improvement but still poor cat breath. We've switched to CET toothpaste and kept using the CET oral rinse--in two days it's done the trick, no more bad breath! We won't be buying Petrodex again, the extra two dollars saved isn't worth it."
5,This Started It All,"This is the season that started it all. Though it is short compared to the other seasons, it is quite possibly the funniest. Granted, the stories and plot does not carry over, but the foundations of the show were built here and each episode allows a person to have a good laugh without having too many carryover jokes."
4,Great First Season.,"Okay, so many people complain that the first season is only 6 episodes long. Well, get over it! As for almost any other show, the first season can be a little hard to get into, given that you are just getting to know the characters. I think that the writers did a great job in introducing the characters and sub-plots in these few episodes, and makes all of the other seasons even more enjoyable."
1,Unfunny Lead Performance Dooms This Show,"Steve Carrell's acting job in this comedy is just unbelievable. As other reviewers have noted, his character is so outrageous and so out-of-bounds that he's totally unbelievable. That dooms the rest of the show, as everything revolves around Carrell's character. Maybe he was trying to top the BBC version, but I expected so much better from him after seeing his movie roles, that this show was a total letdown."
4,"good, but not the US type of good","this was entertaining but not as good or funny as our U.S. show. it is a different feel of comedy, but it still made me laugh"
3,over the top,"I started watching The Office during the 3rd season on TV and love it. The first season however, is WAY over the top. Michael (Steve Carell) is beyond stupid in season 1. I am happy to say I get the impression that he starts to tone it down a bit by the 3rd season."
4,Good Stuff,"The comedic timing, along with the wacky stories, is the best part about this show. The sheer awkwardness of the interactions between these people, pulled off brilliantly by these top-notch actors, will leave you laughing out loud.The central cast is backed by a large amount of recurring characters (other employees) who shine just as much as some of the stars. Each episode is a quick twenty minutes, which allows for quick and pleasant viewing. While this season is very short--one disc with six episodes on it--it will surely leave you craving more ""The Office"" hilarity.8/10"
1,Obnoxious,"If you are an American it is hard to understand the english in this show. I didn't finish out show one so I might not be the best reviewer here because obviously others liked it. I might try to watch it one more time but I doubt it. I liked an english sitcom called "" The IT crowd"" better"
1,Still haven't got it.,"I ordered this series a month ago, I received in the mail a completely different movie addressed to someone in connecticut ( I live in Louisiana) I then payed out of my own pocket to mail it to the address on the slip. I contacted the seller and they said they would work on getting me my product. Then yesterday I sent an email to see what was going on and they told me they have confirmation of delivery a month ago. So now I have to reexplain what happened to what I am assuming is a different employee."
1,Good but a bit misleading.,"I enjoyed the episodes that were on the DVD.... but I thought, with the title THE OFFICE SEASON ONE, it would include all the episodes of Season One and not just 3.I was left wanting more....... much more!However, the three episode included in this DVD were funny."
5,Gentle Julia,A great book by Booth Tarkington. I love it to read as classic novel in the regency genre like Alexander Duma or Honore de Balzac a little humor like from Vanity Fair by William Thackeray. I love to read the story again.
5,One of my all time favorites!,"I think I was maybe three years old when I first saw this movie and fell in love with Fieval. I just saw it again a week or so ago and like the first time, I loved it. This is a great movie for the family!"
5,"A dream, a tragedy, a new begging, a happy ending","This movie is coming out in 1/2004 on DVD, & I can't wait.The determination to find his family Fievel meets many people from rich to poor, bad & good. Fievel using a story from his papa was able to help the mice get together, & defeat the cats.The end show Fievel waking up after being knocked out, to his father voice...Get it, love it"
5,THE CHIEFTAINS & BLUEGRASS,This is the best bluegass album i've heard in years! If your a fan of the Chieftains and/or bluegrass you have to get this cd. It made me break out the Bushmill's and Guinness and dance a jig.
3,Not up to the usual Chieftains standards : (,The tracks are only mildly pleasent. They could have done with a few less guest artists and a little more Chieftains. You can't win them all. Save your money.
5,Grandfathers Memories - Wonderful idea!,"I completed the Grandmothers Memories for our grandaughters last Christmas and they asked if their Papa would do the same type of book. Lots of memories generated, great gift!"
2,Very Christian,"I've been looking for a grandfather-specific journal to give to my father-in-law. This looked respectable enough but I was disappointed to find Christian prompts and biblical quotes at the bottom of every page. If you're not Christian, you might be willing to overlook questions like ""Your favorite verse about God"". Unfortunately it's harder to ignore the random bible quotes at the end of every section.""We love Him because He first loved us."" This book is less of a celebration of the grandfather in your life and more of a devotion to the Christian faith."
3,"The way of ""Street Fighters""","This book is based upon the rules of ""Street Fighters"", which was unsccessful series in White Wolf products. I thought that the combat system of ""Street Fighters"" was not so playable for ""role playing game style"". This book contains the same problem. But this book show us how the creatures of World of Darkness fight with martial arts. That is interesting to me."
3,Great but flawed printing,"This is a wonderful book but the version I was sent did not match the See inside version. The copy I received was printed in China, rather than the United States, and had numerous problems. The binding cracked when I opened the book, one page had obvious misprints in the constellation drawings (p. 30), and the constellation charts on pp. 74-105 were printed all the way into the gutter margins, making some of the text very difficult to read. Also, the text on facing pages was not aligned. Great book but poor production values, at least in the copy I received."
5,The only guide to the constellations you'll ever need,The book is a magnificent teacher of our nighttime skies. This is the only star guide you'll ever need unless you buy a telescope.
5,The Stars,"Love this book! My boys had it when they were little, it got misplaced, so I got it again for my grandkids. Still wonderful after all these years!"
3,Very!!! Very!!! Small! Displays only a few slices of cake!,"I purchased this dome with hopes of using it for a cake. I was surprised when I received it. It measured 7.5 inches; not 8 inches like stated in the description. It is very lovely and unique, but just not large enough for the purpose I had in mind."
5,"Wild River 8'6"" MHF2","I'm glad I ordered this beautiful rod. The blank's very swift, dynamic and robust. To put it in a nutshell, it's a really versatile rod. The cork handle is beautiful and as smooth as silk. This is the right gear for an abundance of great fishing experiences. What more can I ask for? I really love this rod, thanks St.Croix!"
5,Moving beyond,"I want to start this review like i've started several others. This is *not* for all metalheads. Not even for all meshuggah fans. If you liked the earlier stuff but didn't dig Nothing, then you're better off not getting this album.Now, if you're like me and enjoy groove-oriented math metal, this *is* for you. This is a step past Nothing but in the same direction. You won't find anything like ""I"" or ""War"" or any of the other almost-speed/thrash songs. Well, except in parts. The songs are much more groove-oriented like those from Nothing. Yes, they move kind of slow and the music could be monotonous because the riffs are repetitive, but that's the whole *effect*. that's what they're going for. I've never understood people who complain that an album doesn't sound like the one five years ago from a band. ""It doesn't sound the same""...oh, gee whiz there. you think? what the heck is the point of putting out an album of the same material?"
4,My intro to Meshuggah,This was my first album for Meshuggah and really not what I expected. Its a good album but I dont like the whole one huge song split into 13 peices thing. Still pretty good though.
4,"Solid, Not Great","I usually classify greatness by whether or not I will spin this over and over in my CD player, and in this case it is questionable. This is an experimental record with some good moments (Re-inanimate, Entrapment, In death - Is life, Shed, Pesonae non gratae and Dehumanization) but it can be damn boring in spots like the way too long In Death is Death amd Sum. Also, I didn't think the song Mind's Mirrors fit (the voice is way too spacey, not mean enough to mix with the Meshuggah vocals). The lyrics are awesome and if the music were as good I would be giving this record 6 stars. So in summary, music 3.5 stars, lyrics 6 stars, uniqueness 5 stars, long term playability 3.5 stars = 4 stars. Still Meshuggah is a cool band that never ceases to surprise."
4,Enjoyable but overrated,"I approached this novel as one who enjoys Dickens, and also as one who enjoys the concept of ""retelling"" a classic story from another perspective. But while I enjoyed it, I found _Jack Maggs_ to be slow-moving and many of the characters not altogether convincing. The most interesting concept was the use of Dickens himself (disguised as ""Tobias Oates"") in the plot, and the intermingling of fiction with some true events, and some speculations about true events, in Dickens's life. But the tale could have been told in perhaps two-thirds of the length without losing very much."
3,Good read,"A fun read, well written but the story take a long time to unfold. I was forcing myself to read on. But right about half way through the story unfolds and grabs you. The finish is entertaining."
2,Disappointing in many ways,"The premise of the book is very good and even the characters are excellant but after that it falls short. I love Dickens and this book is a sore excuse for a spin off. While set in the time of Dickens little else here resembles a Dickens work. The plot is just your standard modern day [same old stuff]. This is the kind of book that makes you so sick of modern day literature that you long to read the old classics like Great Expectations again. Unfortunately, Dickens is dead while Carey lives on to write more sub-par books."
2,Only if you've nothing better to do ...,"I can't help feeling there is something autobiographical in Carey's portrayal of Tobias Oates, an author who annotates each page with the fee he will receive for it. Whilst the quality of writing is excellent, you can never lose the sense that this is a book written by method - the characters have colour but never live; the plot holds but only weakly and at the end you are interested but don't care.As such, the book is the literary equivalent of a TV mini-series. If you have a quiet weekend ahead, then this is as good a way as any to fill it - but make sure you've exhausted all the alternatives first."
5,:0),I loveeeee this movieif you want to be entertain and have fun this is the movie to watch and add to your collection..it gets better with age
4,A silly but fun and entertaining film,"I had seen this film back in the 80's and thought it was a wonderful comedic view of spies. When I watched it this time I realized that the humor was a bit silly but still entertaining. If you liked Kathleen Turner in other film like ""Jewel of the Nile"" I think you will enjoy this little known gem."
5,Hilariously entertaining and refreshing,"Turner, Quaid, and Tucci (along with some other unknown cast members) are side-splitting funny in this action/comedy. Fit for family night or just hanging out with friends, ignore what the critics have said. You will watch this movie over & over and find something hilariously new each time. Definitely a must have for your movie collection. 2 THUMBS UP!"
5,From a Stroke Caregiver,Final StrokeI used this book during my research for my novel and found it uplifting. I was a caregiver for a stroke survivor and used my experiences in my fiction writing. I applaud Julia for this fine work.
3,A little disappointed,"I bought this to replace some old ones that wore out. I bought 2 because we needed them to replace 2 worn out ones. These are NOT inexpensive items but they are not made with the best materials. They should be built to last, given the price. So far, I have had to replace all the nuts and bolts in all the joints as they have already worn out. The other brackets are bending just from the stress of regular use. I had to rewire one of the lamps because it just quit working. And now I am noticing that where the arm attaches to the round case of the lamp head, the metal is cracked and bending and it is only a matter of time before it just breaks. I don't know what to tell you. They just don't make things like they used to. However, they should not cost this much if a year is all you can expect out of them."
3,A swift kick to the nuts following a litre of bad whisky,"The drippiness of this album in general is saved in the final 4 minutes and 11 seconds with the arrival of the most formative and evocative song of my youth - The Wings That Fly Us Home. Bugger the rest, buy it simply for the power and sheer spiritual depth of this one track which surely provided the vehicle for the rest of this weak album to travel upon. A song (therefore album?) to die for and to die with, despite the bitter irony within it's words."
5,excellent read,"If you buy into this theory, shown to me by my current golf instructor, then this book is a must. I have been taking lessons and my current teacher uses many aspects from this book. I am striking the golf ball much better and can't wait to hit the links again."
1,COMPLETELY FALSE,"The band listing on amazon for this disk tricked me into buying a product that doesn't exist.Here is the real track listing.1. Babes In Toyland: Sweet '692. Moist: Machine Punch Through3. The Jayhawks: Blue4. Letters To Cleo: I See5. The Muffs: Sad Tommorow6. Earth 18: Girl Of The Downward Smile7. Suddenly, Tammy!: Hard Lesson8. Underground Lovers: Dream It Down9. Big Head Todd & The Monsters: Wearing Only Flowers10. Senser: Age Of Panic11. Underworld: Dirty Epic"
2,Disgusting,"I have been waiting for years to actually see a Robert Jordan book that follows what was in the first 7. All those books, while having some filler in them, were action packed. (...). Repackaging a book that has already been released into two books will end up [confusing] people who have already bought ""The Great Hunt"", and will end up annoying more people than it pleases. The greed in this stunt is disgusting, and I honestly feel that he has alienated many people with it."
3,"Passable, But Definitely Overrated","I'm a long time John Denver fan, but I'm a little surprised by the enthusiastic reviews for this album, which doesn't hold a candle to much of JD's other work. It sounds a bit like one of those albums put together with a few decent tracks and then padded with mediocre cuts which didn't make it onto other albums. JD's familiar trademark passions reach out in Singing Skies and Dancing Waters and To the Wild Country, but the rest of the material is pretty forgettable. An essential element of JD's appeal is his use of good songs and these are mostly missing here. If you're a big JD fan, this album will be a must for your collection in any case. However, if you're interested in this period of JD's music, I can recommend Windsong and Seasons of the Heart over this album."
5,"Denver changes his style, and still makes beautiful music...","This album is one of John Denver's best, in my opinion. With a diversity that most people don't realize Denver had, his piano-driven songs are many of the high-lights of this album. ""I Wanna Live"" is a heart-felt, operatic tune with a powerful chorus. ""Dearest Esmerelda"" is a beautiful song with beautiful lyrics, one of my faves on this album. ""To the Wild Country"" and ""It Amazes Me"" are beautiful tunes about, well, of course...nature. These songs differ from many of John's earlier ones because of their specific change in structure between the chorus and the verses. ""How Can I Leave You Again"" shows Denver at his troubled best: A song that could easily have come from Denver in '71, but with a beautiful piano and a style of singing that is more along the lines of ""Bridge Over Troubled Water,"" than ""Follow Me."" All in all, a great album in which a musician adds to and changes his music, and it works well. A MUST for any true John Denver fan."
4,"Framemaker, excellent but....","Framemaker is an excellent product that offers all sorts of advanced features. For example, it is simple to produce and print out a double-sided document with a universally applied page format. However, the instruction manual is the worse example of documentation that I have ever experienced. After completing production of a book (several files amalgamated into one group that may be worked on as an entity)it is reasonable to assume the next step will be to generate a list of contents. You will have to work it out for yourself as the section dealing with this topic is gobbly- gook, disjointed,full of unexplained terminology and frankly not understandable. Take my advice, if you are not good at working things out for yourself, the instruction manual is a very good reason why you should choose another product"
1,The NASTIEST tasting tea I've ever had the displeasure of drinking.,"I love tea and drink at least three cups of green tea per day. I wanted to try a tea with kava because I've heard so many good things about its relaxing properties. Unfortunately I still don't know if kava has any effect on me because I gagged on the first sip of this Yogi tea. I brewed the tea as directed, but nothing can help the nasty, medicinal, weirdly sweet flavor. Sasparilla is the second ingredient, and the root beer flavor really comes across combined with the numerous other ingredients including cinnamon, cardamom and ginger along with sweetness from the stevia which I assume were all added to mask the ""dirt"" flavor kava is said to have. I just personally can't stand this flavor. If you don't usually drink tea that has numerous ingredients like this, I would save the receipt just in case you dislike it and need to return it."
3,Arrived as promised,"This tea is spicy, kind of like a chai. I can't vouch much for the stress relief potential of it, but it did make my lips tingly and my tongue a bit numb. I think if you sat down, with a long-steeped strong cup of this, you would be able to feel the kava do its magic."
4,Pretty good!,Works well just doesn't taste the best!!I think if actually tasted like tea it would be a little better. Try to 2 bags instead of one for a better high. Get ready to be velcroed to the couch!
2,A little too sweet...,"This tea would be nice if wasn't so sweet. The cinnamon tastes great but the sweetness is very strange and overpowering and ruins the tea. I use stevia to sweeten other teas and my coffee and it's not sweet like it is in this tea. The effects are nice however, 4 hours later I do have a bit of a headache. I may look for another Kava tea or perhaps try it in another form."
4,A comprehensible introduction to Hegel's Philosophy of History,"Comparing this translation with that of Sibree (1991), I find this one to be clearer and for more penetrable. Even if you read Sibree's entire translation of Hegel's ""The Philosophy of History,"" I suggest you read this introduction instead, if you wish to comprehend the rest of the book by its introduction."
2,My $0.02,"Hegel was immensely popular in his time but I do not think his ideas hold up well today. I believe that his greatness lies in his influence to be found in the even greater philosophers who followed him. I'd be lying if I said that some of the ideas he brings up in this work aren't interesting, but I wouldn't be if I said that the prose itself isn't."
4,"Great for beginners, but the Spanish is geared for Spain","I am currently teaching from this book, and I am saddened that it is geared towards Spain.Other than that, it is fun and lively and well-thought out. Great for those who haven't had Spanish in a while."
5,My kids love it!,"We first saw a DVD of Miss Pattycake that I found at our local library, and ever since my two girls (ages 1 and 2) love to sing the songs. When I found this CD, I knew they would enjoy it because it combines songs from several of the Miss Pattycake DVDs. I was not disappointed--they ask for it all the time!"
2,Not What It Should Have Been,"Melanie the perfect singer for Christmas songs? Yes, so I thought. I wish Melanie would have released a Christmas album back when she was in full command of her voice and had proper studio backing. There are a lot of songs on this album, the best being the songs she wrote. It is in these original songs that Melanie's passion is clearly on display. But, once she sings the classic Christmas songs, she slips both vocally and the production is cheap(at best). However, she does do a fine verson of ""O Come All Ye Faithful."" "" Silent Night' and especially ""O Holy Night"" suffer from tedious vocals. ""O Holy Night"" is a song Melanie should have nailed; she is a very emotional singer but here she sounds bored. The rest of the CD suffers from tedious vocals, trite production and it has a ""let's get this over with"" feel to it."
3,"Good story, but a bit cheesy","I knew the story behind this movie, but the film did help provide a picture of the setting during the rise of christianity in Alexandria. It was clear that it wasn't a big budget movie and was a tad on the cheesy side, but still worth the watch."
4,Hypatia,This movie captures a time in history that is often over simplified. How many of us today know how well educated women could be during that time. Spend a weekend with Hypatia and Cleopatra and you'll see the world in a far different way.
3,historic/,tough to see Jews and pagans and christian fighting and killing each other. so its ok. not really that entertaining though. good acting. sets were amazeing.
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This film belongs in the Hall of Fame for Worst Movie Ever. It is lovely to look at, but the actors are horrible. The plot idea is good, but the execution fails. The dialog and movement seem really false. It just doesn't seem like a representation of real people of any time period. I tend to love period pieces, but I actually hated this and could not finish it. Horrid."
1,"quality is ""made for tv""","it is an attempt to discuss science vs religion; which is a topic that should bode great movie material. but ...this movie is not realistic, storyline not believable, plot is thin. especially stupid is a script that repeats the same dialogue over and over; weak effects, and non-realistic make-up where the actors always look clean as if straight out of a salon. if you want to watch a movie that should have been a television broadcast, this is it..."
1,Skip it.,Not an original idea in this movie. The acting is so stilted that I couldn't make it through halfway.I have always thought Weiz was an overrated actress. She didn't disappoint in Agora: bad.
4,Big Bonds fan,"I'm a big Barry Bonds fan, dating back to the 1996 season when I chose him first in the first fantasy draft I ever participated in. Since then I've been his biggest fan. This book is very well written and very informative, but it's also way too hard on Barry. I think the writer doesn't give enough attention to the fact that it is very hard to be a great athlete, and that great athletes are not like other people. If Barry is somethimes mean, maybe that's the reason. But I still enjoyed the book and learned many things I never knew. I just think there should be more good about him."
3,Ultimately Disappointing,"I am a S.F. Giants fan and have enjoyed the excitement Mr. Bonds has brought to that over the past years, but I am neither an apologist, nor do I turn a blind eye to what may be negative reality as it applies to him. Mr. Pearlman's book feels even-keeled as it starts, but rather soon moves quickly into bias against Bonds. By the end, Mr. Pearlman seems a Bonds' hater. The book still has value as an interesting collection of comments by third parties and a good number of interesting tidbits about the history of this baseball player. The ""non-baseball"" portions of the book seem small in comparison. There also seems to be a much too large reliance on what others have written or opined about Bonds and this materials adds little to learning about him. Ultimately, the book was disappointing, even if quite readable."
2,"disappointment if you loved ""Lonesome Dove""","The acting, directing and plot don't compare to the original. I was very disappointed in it. Don't botther if my davice."
5,The archetype of TV western series,The DVDs were new and factory sealed as promised. They arrived promptly. Only Deadwood challenges these two western series - Lonesome Dove and Return to Lonesome Dove. The acting is superb and the story is inspiring. The production quality and resolution are surprisingly good for almost 6 hours of video on only 2 discs.
2,not nonstick,"I bought this at target after reading some good reviews. It is nicely made and solid and fits onto my glass cooktop nicely however mine is not non-stick and I have been rather unhappy with its performance. I have owned it for about 6 months and make pancakes on it several times a week. My pancakes always stick to the surface and are difficult to get off of the griddle making a mess of the pan and the pancakes. I have to use a squirt of cooking spray before each new pour of batter or else I cannot remove the pancakes at all. It is also very difficult to clean as well. I cannot get my stuck-on pancakes off of the surface and have tried numerous different cleansers and soakings to no avail. I'd appreciate any input from those who have had good results from this pan, otherwise I will be purchasing a higher-end calphalon double griddle that is truly nonstick as I have other calphalon products (2 skillets and a wok) that have performed beautifully for years."
2,"Unless you wash before you wash, look elsewhere","I have a dishwasher to wash dishes. I remove chunks and might soak the nasty stuff to soften it before putting it in the dishwasher. Seventh Generation isn't a good match for me. Even after cycles of hot water, presoaking, turbo boosting, and all the other zippy, high-powered settings the dishes still came out dirty. I went through a couple of bottles of this stuff and am convinced it's not the right product for me.This gel smells fresh and I appreciate the commitment to eco-friendly ingredients. I'll stick to Bio-Kleen."
3,"INTERESTING, BUT EXPECT SOME HITCHES","Although the approach used in authoring this book is not very cogent, there is something good about it. The book presented detailed information on how to manipulate such Java technologies like Servlets and ServerPages. There are also grounded tutorials on how to create multi-purpose Web applications.However, instead of making the sample codes available in the textbook, the publisher decided otherwise: opting to make it a downloadable option on her website. Again, most inexperienced Jakarta Struts programmers may find the haphhazard details of DyanActionForm a bit cumbersome."
2,"To learn Struts or ""their"" example????!!!!!!!!!!","The organisation of this book is not very pleasing. While explaining topics they jump from one to another...I get bored very soon while reading this book. The shopping cart example is also not provided in a user-friendly way. It is scattered all over the book. The way of explaining things is really irritating me.. If you buy this book, download the examples from o'reilly website and keep that open always. Because, if you wish to learn a new topic say DispatchAction class, you should first learn how their StorefrontDispatchAction class is defined!!! To learn this class you should learn some other class and the chain goes on.... The author could have explained it with some simple examples instead of this big example."
1,It's a complete mess,"I've bought this book to have an overview of struts, beeing myself an experienced java programmed for years, it would be a good choise. I was wrong! BAD choice. It's a complete mess. You don't understand anything by reading this book! ""You will build up an application""... where? The code is incomplete, it jumps from one thing to another without any logic.Stay away, there are better books on struts (any will do, I'm sure) and internet is also a good reference."
3,Lacks breadth and examples,"I bought this book thinking it would provide greater depth than the previous book I bought on Struts. I was also looking for details on the many tag libs and examples of complex ways of using them.The book is great at providing high level understanding and explaining the basics. However there is little to no example code, no details on the many taglibs, not even an appendix on the taglibs. The book is helpfull, however once you've got the basics down, you can set the book down for good. Needs example code and details on taglibs desperately."
3,Not quite what I had hoped for,"I'll admit that I'm a little new to Struts development, and I was expecting something that would take me through the use of Struts in minute excruciating detail - and this book works sometimes and fails others.I believe that the framework is well suited to help developers accelerate the build process, but if you're looking for a book that takes you through the entire process, look elsewhere.Another thing that really annoyed me was not presenting ALL of the sample code in the book. You can download it from the O'Reilly site, but you shouldn't have to - it should be presented along with everything else."
3,A little disappointing...,"I rely heavily on O'Reilly books because they generally provide complete, understandable, and easy-to-read information about any topic. Because I have come to expect so much from them, I was a little disappointed with this book. The coverage is good, but not great; and I definitely would not recommend this book for someone looking for a complete reference.Instead, I would recommend the Wiley book, Mastering Jakarta Struts. It provides step-by-step instructions for developing a Struts application from scratch, and all code samples are downloadable from the website. It also has complete references for each of the configuration files and the major taglib libraries."
4,Best (but FEW YEARS AGO!),"Outdated, but it was one of the best about Struts. But I gave it 4 stars because it was really my fav."
1,O'Reilly's Quality is Sinking,"I've been using O'Reilly books since I started programming 15 years ago. They used to be by far the best unix books in the industry. In the last few years I've seen the quality sink to the same level as the other mainstream tech books. If they get any worse, they'll be down there with MSFT Press. Yikes!This book is horrible. Full of vague generalizations instead of concrete statements and examples. A 2nd edition is out but I wouldn't touch it."
2,"Struts, smuts","Book is kind of simplistic, but it reflects an 'API' that is overly complicated for what it does. Abstraction is a good thing - as long as it conceptually simplifies an interface. Struts is abstraction for the sake of abstraction. It is a complex abstraction over a set of complex APIs. It seems to me that the designers of Structs just wanted to write an abstraction layer for the sake of writing one. There are lots of complicated things that I normally program that Structs can't even begin to do. And, all the objects that Structs creates makes it perform slowly."
2,Weak covertage of Struts 1.1.,"Tiles, DyanActionForm and validation coverage incomplete and not used in samples. To much detail of different aproaches and why they should not be used yet leaving out some critical aproaches. I was hoping to learn best practices found by the author and not go thorough the trenches myself. Storefront sample is buggy, Banking works.There are some free articles which have a better grasp of the subject. Coverage of older version of Struts is good.Chapter on using ANT build tool with Struts is worth the price of the Book and the best I have seen."
1,Don't bother,"Looks beautiful. Nothing against the poster itself. But for this price it's insane. Pay an extra twenty bucks and get a real screen. Its only worth it if your going to get a nice frame, and even than, its still only a poster. Kinda like a tshirt tux."
3,"Good idea, but...","I got these to hang our Christmas stockings on the brick fireplace chimney of our rental house. I was able to fit the larger hooks somewhat precariously in the crevices between the bricks, but I could not put anything inside the stockings at all without the hook popping out. It may be the way the bricks are, the sort of worn-out style they are. I have it three stars for staying in the bricks, but the last two I left out because I definitely couldn't put even one pound of weight on them. I don't think I could hang a framed picture with them at all."
2,Design for Living: Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne,"I just finished this book and am fascinated with ""The Lunts"" and their legacy. I too thought this book was innappropriate regarding the speculations on their intimate lives. No one will ever know this information and to write rumors about them in a biography is a bit irresponsible. Just because they had many gay friends means nothing. If you want to read a tabloid, this is your book and I have to admit that it is a page turner. I also agree with the previous review, that ""The Fabulous Lunts"" is probably a much better representation of them from a professional standpoint and that Peters favored Alfred in her writing which I think is too bad since they considered themselves a team and should be treated that way by anyone portraying their lives together. I suggest taking a visit to ""Ten Chimney's"" if you really want to get to know ""The Lunts"". It is a most charming place and you still feel their magical presence. It is a very memorable experience."
2,Margot misses the point,"I have to echo the comments made by some of the other customer reviewers. Although this book moves along at a more sprightly pace than The Fabulous Lunts, unfortunately Design for Living makes detours into innuendo and sensationalism. All allegations unfounded. It was as if Ms. Peters thought Lynn and Alfred were not interesting or accomplished enough to write about without throwing some salacious gossip about their sex lives! Too bad."
2,Left wanting more,The biography was not about this famous couple as real people; rather it was a recitation of their newspaper reviews for each production. I have been to their home and taking the tour brought me firmly into their world. Reading this book did not.
5,Amazing,"King makes you wonder not only while reading each one of his 14 amazing short stories, but many days after.Highly recommended to eacg of king's fan."
4,"Good read, interesting stories","Good book, quick read. 14 stories, not all scary per say, but all very interesting. This work shows King's versatile side."
3,Don't Slay Me; Not the King Standard of Excellence,"First and foremost, I'm an avid King fan with every book in hardcover splendor but Everything's Eventual is filled with only 2 stories that I consider up to the maximum King ""Chill Factor"".Upon completion of many of the stories, I was left with a ""that's all?"" question on my lips and feeling as if the story came up short of the normal vivid terror, angst, and surprise factor so prevalent in his works.I can't quite put my finger on it, and I would still encourage the purchase of this particular volume, but the stories included within did not stack up against a classic such as Nightmares and Dreamscapes.Just wanted to be honest with the review and hoping that the King short story magic returns with a future volume."
5,My favorite of any of King's collcetions.,"I rather keep this short and sweet. The title story is tied to the Dark Tower books. And as a treat Little Sisters of Eluria which is about Roland himself. 1408 is amazing, and I rather enjoyed the man in the black suit. All of the stories were great. L. T.'s Theory of Pets and Luckey Quarter are a little diffrent and quite good. A great read. I had a hard time putting this book down."
4,Not outstanding or horrible,"...Every one of King's books of short stories consists of stories previously published. Night Shift, Skeleton Crew, Nightmares and Dreamscapes...all feature stories originally published in anthologies or magazines...This isn't just a King-ism. This is how it happens all the time. What's the big deal? Sometimes a writer might include one or two new stories, but an entire collection of previously published stories is completely normal...""...""s added by Amazon editors. That's where they made their edits."
2,Almost everything's a repeat!,"While I am a ""constant reader"", it made for disappointment while reading this book. Up to half the stories have appeared elsewhere, particularly if you bought the audio tape of short stories a few years ago. Since his writing is plot-driven, if you've read, (or heard) the stories previously, you might as well skip the story entirely. The title story is, to the best of my knowledge, new, and was great. I just wish the book was half as long and half the cost!"
3,"Okay, I guess, but still the worst of King's I've read.","I'm not a fan of the horror genre and I've only read 5 or 6 King books. But I've enjoyed them all and think King is a great writer, one of the best I've read.His short story collection has both pros and cons. If a story doesn't sound interesting, you can skip it. I skipped two in this collection because they just didn't interest me. King proves he has a vivid imagination with this collection yet some stories began to run together when they are all based in Maine.King isn't a writer who has a big climax at the end of his stories or novels. He excels at giving the reader a great story and characters over several 100 pages. In these short stories, King doesn't have the time to develop plot and characters and this since the climaxes aren't surprises or twists, some of his short stories end with a whimper.Still, I enjoyed this collection because I was able to finish each story in a short amount of time and move onto the next one."
4,"Good, But Something's Missing","I've been a fan of Stephen King for a few years now, and Everything's Eventual is the first collection of his short stories that I've read. I enjoyed them all, mostly because they were all good pieces of literature. I was waiting for King's short stories to scare the pants off me and haunt my dreams, but it never happened in any of the stories. Everything's Eventual was a great book, but it was missing the Stephen King scare-factor that I've come to know and love."
3,I think its time,"for Stephen King to retire. There is only one truly brilliant story in this collection: The Man in the Brown Suit. It chilled me like King's stuff always used to. The rest, except for Little Sisters is filler.Everything's Eventual is also something of a rip off. Most of these stories aren't new to any regular King reader. Several are from his Blood & Smoke book that was supposed to be available only in audio form. This was a beautifully packaged disappointment."
3,"Not great, but good","Like Stephen King's body of work, this collection of short stories is a mixed bag. A few were chilling and original, others seemed little more than rambling. I'm not holding it against King. When you're as prolific as he is, not every story's going to be a home run. He has enough great novel that he's earned a few strike-outs and he's still among my favorite authors. That said, this collection is not a strike-out, only a few of the stories are, and another few are so-so (base hits, if you will). I enjoyed the read, but not as much as I usually enjoy King. Kings fans should definitely read it (I won't tell you which stories I liked or didn't like since we all have our own tastes) and readers looking for a few nights of scary stories could do worse."
2,Very poor only 2 out of 14 were worth reading,"I was very disappointed in this book. I am usually very impressed with all of King's work even his short stories. It seemed to ""light"" compared to the normal King fare. The only two stories in the collection that even make this readable are ""Everything's Eventual"" and ""The Little Sister's of Eluria"". Other than those two stories, instead of fighting to out the book down, I had to fight to keep reading."
5,the best for knowing God,"I have been looking for an excellent book to help me understand and get some insight into the attributes and nature of our God. This book definitely does the trick and make me really satisfactory. I do give it a 5.0 rating because of its excellency and in depth. One thing you should know of is the dated English style of the author. It was written in the 17th century, so it is somewhat difficult for me, especially as a foreigner, to read and understand his writing. From what I have read, the author had done an excellent work. I highly recommend this book for everyone who want to know God better and better."
4,Who left what to who and why,"This reprint of an earlier edition contains more current demises and devises, including the wills of Elvis, Jerry and Diana. These peeks at how the glitterati and the grandees shuffled off their mortal coils and bequeathed their worldy possessions is revealing, amusing, sometimes noble and heartening and other times demeaning and peevish. These wills may not be for you, but they remind you that we all enter and leave this plane in a similar, if not identical fashion and the stuff, such as it is, that we accumulate in this realm, is no more than what dreams are made of, but, in our society, must be attended to. This is a snapshot of how some of us attend to that chore."
5,pretty good,"Definitely best price for the items you get, BUT get a bottle of gasket sealant (that can take high heat and petrol) Gasket was not the greatest fit, needs a smite more thickness and teeny more on the edges.. sooo in trying to tighten it down enough to stop the gas flowing out of the carb while running... i busted one of the bolts off (yeah, THAT was fun and not scary at all to drill out of the main body)> I ended up using the orig bolts, a little gasket sealant, and have driven her a few hundred miles now, all is well. The fuel bowl itself is a good fit, and it sure looks purty."
5,Everyone should listen to this,This is definitely the best of Uriah Heep. This is like Mozart or Beethoven. This music is for anyone and everyone. Don't die without experiencing this.
1,...or maybe 1.5...,"Uriah Heep are a very uneven band, releasing great material as well as awful stuff. To like this album you have to be a fan of Uriah Heep's early days, and I think ""Sweet freedom"" is far from one of the finer efforts. But it includes the classic tune ""Stealing""...."
5,Religious Experience,Look....this is when music was music. Just listen....just listen. Sweet Freedom takes you away....You'll understand...Just listen...
4,"2003 Notable Book, Association of Jewish Libraries!",This title was declared a 2003 Notable Book by the Association of Jewish Libraries! Almost 200 children's books of Judaic content were reviewed during the year to find the best of the bunch.
1,More like a smoking oven! FIRE HAZARD!,"We bought this toaster oven and in less than a year it began smoking..i mean really smoking! We contacted the manufacturer and they sent us the same oven, let's hope this one doesn't do the same thing. They said if it did, they would send us a different model, not a refund! I would rather a refund because it's not the best toaster oven overall. It burns rather than toast and even warming up pizza is a challenge, you have to stand there and watch it before it burns your food. Don't buy this toaster oven, it doesn't even deserve ONE star!"
5,BRAVO!! BIG DADDY WEAVE!!!!!!!,"You guys have done it again and better! This new CD should be rated with 10 stars. It is so Christ filled. The growth of you guys as a band is amazing. Every single song on the CD is magnificent. ""Without You"", is the greatest of all !The talent of Big Daddy Weave is the best out there.This CD showcases it all!"
3,Looks like more of the same,"Yet another olympic game without a track event longer than 400m, in this case, nothing longer than a 100m. I am waiting anxiously for the time when an olympic or track game will figure a way to do track besides pushing buttons, or at least incorporate a longer race(at least 800m). Also, 12 events just doesn't cut it, with how many different olympic events there are, i think they could have added many more to make this a more complete game. i recommend digging out your old power pads and nintendos and playing world class track and field."
3,Source code is available,I found the source code for this book (and two additional chapters in PDF format) athttp://support.apress.com/books.asp?bID=186100754x&s;=0Hope this helps.
1,"a 1 star rating, and you made a big liar out of me!!","This one book must not be rated at all!- yes, not even a 1. But everybody must know before they buy it - some chapters are missing and a chapter was taken from another book. Thus, you have to imagine what really goes into those missing chapters. I cannot believe that Amazon is still carrying this book in their website. Why, to populate it with complaints! So arise and be counted: lodge your complaint about this book."
3,"A little messy, but boy did it do the trick!","Loved the bath, just hated cleaning out the tub afterwords. This one leaves a little mess for you but boy is it ever relaxing."
5,Perfect Brush Fit,I have a small mouth so the larger heads are uncomfortable. These are the perfect size brush heads to reach behind the farthest molars. My order came on time and as published. Good price. Great product.
1,Disappointed,"I am disappointed with the product that I received, as the heads get loose after a few uses, and end of cutting the inner lip. I have been using Oral B Precision Clean brushes for some time now (purchased at local store) and never had this problem, thus am assuming it was a bad batch that I received."
2,Not for regular use,These replacement heads are not soft by any means. I don't brush for the full 2 minutes for fear I will take the enamel off my teeth. Being a former dental assistant I know you should only use soft bristle brushes. I think these were made for people who only brush their teeth once a week. I would not buy again.
5,Dedicated User,"My entire family are loyal users of the Oral B electric toothbrush and without exception prefer this toothbrush head. They have gotten very expensive in the stores (even the ""discount"" stores) and I was thrilled to find them at this price through Amazon."
4,it's good!,"i have never used the electronic toothbrush before and i find this one a great product. it works good with my teeth, i like it!"
3,campfire stories,"this is pretty shallow...i lovee the girls and i give them props on a horror movie. i did watch snoop doggs hood of horror and flavs little horror flicks so i expected more than i got. if u are looking for originality and gore then this is not for u. although i have to say it was sort of entertaini9ng because especially the first story reminded me of the times when me and my girls used to have sleep overs and hide under blanklets, telling horror stories."
1,A book to spread hate and intolerance.,"This book deals with how a Christian could win an argument with a Hindu about how his faith is better than Hinduism, and How Jesus is the true savior. It is sad that a person writes a book with the explicit purpose of converting people from their tolerant viewpoints.If people knew how to tolerate diversity, such books would not be written. Amazon needs to take this book off its store."
5,Oldie but Goodie,"I ordered this book as a reference manual. I remember when it first came out and how I relied on it during my early 20s helping me through my childbearing years. Now that I'm ""middle age"" the references to my changing body have been invaluable and it's helping make the transition so much easier."
3,"Great Classic Country, Marginal Audio","This CD features some great 1960's country, however the audio quality on some of the songs sounds quite overmodulated. This seems to be a problem on a lot of Starday releases, which is too bad because they are classic performances."
2,My spiritual Journey,"I was looking forward to see the bible come alive, but what I got was story time.I did not like the fact that it had words on a page.I would recommend this movie only for early bible study."
3,Mothers Book,Good for a another point of view of the story; I gave it to my mom to read as I think it would touch the heart of mothers better.
4,Linda Armstrong Kelly Book Review,"Inspiring woman and even if she wasn't the mother of the 7 time Tour de France legend this would still be a great read.No wonder where Lance got his determination from. Linda is a great example to any mum who thinks they are down on their luck and needs someone to look to.The only downside I thought was she has aliases for the men in her life and other certain characters which sort of loses it's warts and all feeling.Otherwise, definitely recommend this book. You won't be disappointed.[...]"
4,"Frank, Funny and Charming","Reading Linda's story I instantly knew I'd want to lend this book to my Mum after I'd finished it. Are high achievers born or made? You won't find the answer in reading this book, but you'll see how a determined young woman who had every reason to fail succeeded and raised a champion. More importantly I feel - this story isn't just about Lance. It's definitely hers, it's quirky and charming, easy to read and definitely gives you a feel for her character. I preferredIt's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life- but I definitely recommend this as a great follow up read.Kirsty Dunphey, AuthorRetired at 27, If I can do it anyone can"
3,A GREEN POT (Marijuana) LEAF SHIRT,"When I wear this shirt only a few ""420 People"" really know what I'm wearing, others think it's just a flowered shirt.The quality is not that great for a shirt costing over 40 bucks(with shipping) and it would be nice if it had a pocket."
1,Misleading title and cover,"The title of the book would leave one to believe that it examines and demonstrates the position that compassion and empathy go hand in hand with intelligence. This point was perhaps mentioned once in passing (without support) while the rest of the book tried to describe the evolution of the brain and how certain traumas will inhibit its growth. The title also states that it is a guide to further develop the brain. However, most of the book contains no useful information except for the point that the brain can be further developed by doing new and different activities. This is about the extent of the 'guide'. I was quite disappointed overall and certainly didn't read anything revolutionary or even new."
3,"Good, but very 80's","Ok, so the book was really complex. This movie captures some of that complexity; a great deal more than the newer version does.However. It's a TV miniseries, with no sense of humor at all (this doesn't mean you won't laugh - check out the love scene), and a limited effects budget. And some really overblown acting in places. And it still manages to be way more faithful to the book.I seem to remember it being so much better... It helped that I was a kid and living in the 80's at the time and didn't know any better, I suppose. It's still really good, but that's more an effect of sticking to Robert Ludlum's plot than anything. And his plot was really superb, so that does go a long way toward making up for the other stuff.Go read the book."
1,Only buy if you need help sleeping....,"This has to be one of the most boring songs I've ever heard on the ADD label. I didn't think it was catchy at all. The main melody just didn't move me or made me want to dance. Even the ""remixes"" were lame. What XRV did do was make me yawn excessively. In that regard, the XRV single would make an excellent sleep aid, or better yet a drink coaster.If you want to hear some good synth pop on the ADD label, buy Neuropa or Syrian."
4,A few sequels can be better...,"This movie is far less era sensitive than its predecessor, and just about anyone should be able to understand the humor behind the Smell of Fear. There is quite a lot of genius to this particular comedy, and the jokes just do not get old. Of the trilogy this film is the best. The title alone is worth a thousand laughs. If you only buy one Naked Gun movie, make this installment that movie. I think that if modern comedies were more like this than we'd have a lot more genuine laughs."
3,What coulda been,"I am a big fan of the Naked Gun series. But was disappointed in this DVD. There where a couple of missing scenes and no extras to speak of, except the trailer. I geuss I just expected more."
3,The Last Naked Gun,"Not as funny as the original, but is still definately worth watching. Leslie never fails to deliver as the bumbling detective."
4,I've been swimming in raw sewage...I LOVE IT!,"I actually did like this move quite a bit, and it was amazingly funny, but it had a few too many man-gets-hit-by-something-and-falls jokes for me. This is my least favorite Naked Gun movie yet I still watch it all the time and have a good laugh. the Naked Gun movies to me are the funniest movies ever created, and this is no exception. It is great, but I think you would first want to check out the other two. My favorite scene: The one where Frank and Ed go into the sex shop while Norberg is going under all the cars. Another downer: there were too many jokes stolen from the series it was based on, Police Squad! Otherwise, very good and very very funny."
4,Leslie Neilsen..... The God of Spoofs.,"Like Charlie Sheen in ""Hotshots"" and Cary Elwes in ""Robin Hood, Men in Tights"", the key to a successful spoof is to have the cast keep a straight face throughout all the jokes. Leslie is the king at that. The three naked guns are (along with the Austin Powers movies and Blazing saddles) the best spoofs ever made. All of Leslies others (Spy Hard, Dracula, dead and loving it, Wrongfully accused and the abominable Mr Magoo) don't even come close. 33 1/3 is my least favourite Naked Gun movie and I still watch it all the time. They are all absolutely Hillarious. Watch out for the Sperm bank scene. It is one of the funniest scenes on film."
2,"7 OK, 1 died very quickly","Ordered 16 batteries in 3 different sizes from this vendor and all arrived promptly. All working when installed. Subsequently, one of the size N batteries failed (less than a week).I don't blame the vendor; stuff like this happens.I would buy from these guys again, no problem."
2,Disappointing,"I so wanted to like this book because I really love Greek Gods. And the premise showed lots of potential and drew me in. Unfortunately the execution was lacking. The dialogue was stale and there was lots of telling, rather than showing. No deep point of view into the characters - it left me cold and I found myself skipping whole paragraphs just to get through it. I think the story could still hold up and the original premise would work, but I think a re-write is in order to make this more exciting and fun."
4,Shows Promise,"The whole premise of this book intrigued me from the beginning and I do think this author shows a lot of promise in her work but this book definitely still needs a little work. Her characters are interesting and she does have the ability to blend mythology and modern society in a funny and entertaining way. My main problem would be in the developing relationship between the hero and heroine, while entertaining his constant turning to stone and back to human again definitely made the relationship feel stalled at times which obviously when your man's a statue it would feel that way. that might just be my particular taste in romance, but I still enjoyed this story, it's a light and enjoyable fluff read and I would definitely check out more by this author."
5,A 5 Star read!,"This non typical read was very well done. It had and intelligent story line and characters that left you laughing. Enjoyable from the first page to the last. The only bad thing about this book was the turning of the last page, it left me wanting for more."
4,"Great book, with help","I had a difficult time learning the basic knitting stitches alone with this book. It would be better if there were more pictures of what each stitch should look like when completed correctly for us beginners who have never picked up knitting before.Once I took a short class to teach the movements of the very basic stitches, the book was very easy to follow. It is becoming a great reference item."
4,Maybe I need the book for idiots.....,"KNITTING FOR DUMMIES was written for me- or, as the cover says ""A Reference for the Rest of Us."" I am starting again at the beginning with the urging of my 10-year old granddaughter who wants me to teach her how to knit. I told her I would, and now I have to come through or I will be a grandmother who makes promises she can't keep. I told her I was just relearning myself, and that I would teach her as I learned. Thank goodness for the DUMMIES book.The KFD pages are marked with little ""wizard"" icons like those that pop up on your computer software packages to indicate, technical stuff, knitting tips, and ""remember"" notation to remind you of something you should have learned a few pages back. I haven't progressed very far, but the steps I have followed have been very straightforward and relatively uncomplicated. This is a good book for a beginner like me, but just in case I'm going for the idiot book too."
4,A great book for Starters!,"I love this book. I wanted to pick up knitting and no matter how many times people showed me I couldn't pick it up. I have only had this book for 5 months now and have knitted a purse, change purse, makeup bag and scarves. I find it very easy to read and follow. I am getting ready to practice the other patterns they give. They have an extensive set of patterns to try and they are cute ones. I recommend this book if you want a great refrence to get started.**Still a great book a year and a half later!**"
3,Good for beginners,"This is a good, basic book for someone just learning to knit, but it doesn't really offer anything I could see for anyone with a few years of experience. I picked up a few tips here and there, but not enough to be worth the purchase price."
3,Light Reading,"I don't consider the time spent reading this book wasted, but I don't feel that I would have missed much if I never read it."
3,Quiet!,"It is very quiet, and it appears to work really well on odors. If I cook or use disinfectant to clean, it turns itself to a higher setting and gets rid of the smell.However, I was hoping it would eliminate dust, which it does not appear to do. I have just as much dust on my furniture as I did before I bought it. And I bought it because I can't stand the dust.I did not buy this for any other reason other then dust control, which I am not getting, therefore I am not happy. If I bought it for other reasons, I would be totally satisfied."
5,"Sticks when you want it, comes off when you don't","Works perfectly on a variety of surfaces. I use it to organize the pantry, label drawers, on baby bottles, file folders, basically any non-fabric surface. Huge improvement over Post-It notes, which is what I tried first. As another commenter noted, don't try to remove it while it's wet. If the label does get wet, just let it dry and it will remove cleanly."
2,Moen 1560V Extensa One-Handle Faucet,"We are very disappointed in the quality of this faucet. The handle does not keep tightness - we have had to fuss with it twice since installing it last month. The faucet itself is inferior quality to what we had before - cheap plastic, not ceramic. The hose is very inflexible, and the swivle is awkward. It still looks nice, the water comes out properly on stream and spray. No problems with shipping, just not the quality we expected."
1,A pullout kitchen faucet that often leaks!,"The hose that screws onto the head often becomes unscrewed and then it leaks! I have to constantly check up on this thing to make sure that the stuff under the sink doesn't get soaked, or I have to keep the stuff under the sink to a minimum. The leak has also damaged the ceiling of our finished basement below the sink. One light fixture in the basement even filled with water! I am left wondering if a pull-out kitchen faucets are ever worth the trouble!"
5,BEST customer service,"Loved the faucet but it rusted after 5 years. Moen replaced for free including free shipping without any hassles. They've changed the problems with the old design, so if you like the look, I'd buy it!"
2,cheap,"The pull-out nozzle is cheap: it's plastic and doesn't firmly ""lock"" back into the base after pulling it out. Although it's less expensive than other faucets on the market, it's still too much money for what you get. I would not recommend this faucet."
2,Lasted four years... sort of,"Yeah, that might sound like a long time, but for a kitchen faucet, it really isn't. Bought this to replace the one that our builder installed (that one lasted eight years before developing a leak). This new one was fine for about two years, then it started to leak, so we called Moen customer service about their lifetime warranty. They were perfectly nice, shipped us a new 'snake' hose to replace the leaky one free of charge, and all was well... until the handle on this one stopped working properly, so shutting the water off involves finding just the right handle position. Argh.Guess all those other reviews were right; Moen doesn't mind replacing these under their lifetime warranty because they're made so cheaply in the first place. Maybe we'll try a Kohler next time..."
2,If you can take your mind back to being 15 years old...,"you will enjoy this movie. It's all about one thing...sex. More specifically, it's all about a young man's sexual obsession for his gorgeous neighbor, the super-gorgeous Keri Russell. I admit, she is the only reason to watch this movie."
4,Why is this NOT on dvd yet?,"It's a good movie, but for the poor souls who have dvd players... We can't watch it!"
4,Keri Russell is sexy,"First, I have to tell you I got this movie because I'm a fan of Keri Russell. In this movie she is pretty, sexy and flirty. The movie delivered on all the eye candy I was expecting. I have to give credit to the director for getting her to run through the sprinkler in the thin white shirt. It instantly became see-through and the slow motion was awesome! Thanks for that! There are some other really good eye candy scenes. As far as the story, it's pretty funny at times. It's not your typical shallow teen movie.I highly recommend this movie to fans of Keri Russell and also to fans of teenager movies.Four stars!"
5,Amazon track listing incorrect for this release!!,"Amazon did not update the extra tracks that are available on this 2004 Sanctuary update Re-mastered version of this classic, so here is the correct title listing:1. Sunrise2. Spider Woman3. Blind Eye4. Echoes in the Dark5. Rain6. Sweet Lorraine7. Tales8. Magician's Birthday9. Crystal Ball [#][*][Outtake]10. Silver White Man [#][*][Outtake]11.

5,Memories revisited,"I had this album on vinyl many years ago, so was excited to find it on CD, didn't know if I would still enjoy this music or if it was a silly phase I went through in my youth, but HELL NO it still rocks."
2,Awesome! simply AMESOME!!!,"Tony Jaa, the new champion. This movie has excellent stunts ands fight scenes a must buy for martial arts lovers. you won't regret."
3,good action bad acting,i bought this movie from [...] a month after it came out in theaters. I saw both and having the chance to have seen it several times I can say that the action is really well but the acting is virtually non existant and a lot of the dialogue is not believeable...i don't know if thats from bad translation or from bad in movie dialogue but nothing is really believable in the entire movie other then the fighting
5,Awesome,"Great movie lots of awesome stunts and fighting scenes glad I watched it, now want to see the rest of the trilogy to see how it ends :)would recommend to anyone who likes action movies."
3,Warning about Subtitle,"The DVD is pretty good. There are some interesting extras, particularly The Movements of Muay Thai. I watch a lot of non-english movies and prefer listening the original audio track with subtitles, rather than watching it dubbed. But, I have a bone to pick with this release. As far as I can tell, there is only a closed caption ""dubtitle"" track rather than a true subtitle track. Personally, I can stand these kind of tracks with their ""audience shouting"" and ""man shouting"". If there was a normal subtitle track I would give it atleast a 4. Anyway a heads up."
2,a book of its time,"I love Shostakovich's score to the movie based on this book and since I couldn't find the movie I got the book instead. It's about a revolutionary in 19th century Italy. Despite being written by a British author, it never got much traction in the english-speaking world but was apparently very popular in communist countries.This book (first published in the 1890s) is very much of its time in that it takes a romantic view of revolutions and revolutionaries. A view that is difficult to sustain today as so many revolutions have ended in gulags and dictatorships.On top of that I found the main character to be too annoying and unsympathetic. In order for this book to work you have to accept the Gadfly as being some sort of hero but I just couldn't.If you can forget the 20th century ever happened then maybe you'll be able to buy into the worldview of this book."
1,"Too good to be true, but also too expensive","I first read this book more than 50 years ago, and it has lost none of its punch. However, charging $35 for it is obscene. I should have checked the Gutenberg Project first."
2,Private Wings will not work on windows 2000 or XP,This software will not work on windows 2000 or XPIt uses 16 bit password protected files that cannotbe unzipped with 32 bit systemsbetter aircraft can be downloaded
4,Great recording,Farewell Andromeda is another of those old LP's that I have replaced with CD's. It is a good sign when one is willing to purchase multiple copies of an album. I love John Denver's clear voice and his wonderful songwriting.
4,"""Berkeley Woman"" Alone is Worth the Cost",What a great guy's song. I am surprised that the Politically Correct Denver recorded it but I will always respect him for it.
5,MUST HAVE!!,"This is a MUST HAVE for Ripley's fans. It is the ultimate in Ripley books. It contains beautiful color pictures, and history of all the Ripley finds and adeventures. Great book."
1,Disappointing movie,"Normally, I don't mind movies that use visuals instead of dialogue to tell the story as long as the visuals give a good insight into the character. I also don't mind if the plot is simple as long as it is revealed in a compelling way. However, the visuals seem to give a sense of the environment around the characters than revealing anything about the characters especially in the second half. Nothing in the movie compelled me to feel anything for the character even when she finally got the guy. This movie was a waste of my movie-viewing time."
5,"Magical, mystical memories of sounds and scenes of Vietnam.","Having spent several years working in a small village of Vietnam, I still cannot believe that this beautifully crafted film was not shot in the heart of Vietnam. The scenes, sounds and the breathtaking authentic look of the film take me back to those early 60's years in the country side of South Vietnam. The story, the people and the ambiance of this film is true and honest and constitute a memorial adventure for the viewer. I have wanted to share this film with my family for so long. Thanks Amazon for finding me a copy."
5,out of the ordinary,"This is a rather unusual Nancy Drew mystery involving seances, hynoptism, and a journey to New Orleans for Nancy, George and Bess. Nancy is attempting to help Mrs. Putney, a woman recently widowed, who, while gullible in some matters, does not completely trust Nancy.The action is non-stop and the plot moves breathlessly and will sweep you up. ""The Ghost of Blackwood Hall"" is a thriller, and highly recommended."
4,the most wonderful book that i have ever read!,"Hey, if youre looking for something really cool and very thrilling,why not read Carolyn Keenes The Ghost Of Blackwood Hall with the super sleuth Nancy Drew. In the story, she was determined to solve a case of an old client involving some jewelry thievery and later on, it was complicated with a ghost playing on an organ in a dark,old mansion. She was also been assigned to study the cases of 3 working ladies for they are giving and donating money on a crook company. The very interesting part in the story is that when Nancy, with her friends George and Bess, first went to the old mansion. Come on, share the thrill and go on screaming when you read this wonderfull stuff. thanks!!!!!!"
5,Best Stroller!,"I have had this stroller for over a year now and I still love it. I had a Jeep Wagoneer Tandem Stroller prior to this and never could steer it. I would have to lift up the stroller by the handle to maneuver it. This stroller is a breeze to steer. I have 4 kids and when I am in a big hurry my 1 yr. old sits in the front and I put my 3 and 5 year old on the bench seat with my 6 year old standing (yep, I can squeeze them all in) and I can push it no problem (and I am very petite).I like the cupholders. I like the storage space. My kids like the stroller. Sometimes it is a little difficult to fold because the wheels turn the wrong way or something - I am not really sure why but I just try a few times and get it closed. Even with that minor problem I still feel it is 5 stars."
2,Product sent not as advertised...,The picture and description that is represented of the ink cartridge on Amazon is NOT what you get. This is a REMANUFACUTRED item. I had to call 2x to get a refund. Finally got it. They might have changed the pic by now...?
4,Enjoyable,"I liked this story quite a bit. Not the best I've ever read, but still very good. I liked the characters, though they were a bit predictable, still the story moved along well with plenty of action. Been reading fantasy such as this for over two decades. This one will enjoy.If you like books like this one, might I suggest another I've recently come across. The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. It's another fantasy adventure sure to please. I highly recommend it. It's available in e-Book too."
1,Cheaply made. Didn't work with batteries.,"Cheap plastic construction. Battery mode didn't work unless I shook the device, and was then intermittent. Expected way more, given the cost."
3,Average,"I'm a huge Jackie Chan fan for many years but this movie wasn't quite as good as some of his other ones.It was more serious/darker,with not as much humor.Didn't enjoy the fight scenes as much as some of his other movies.(I know he was injured and had a double)plus I'm not much into racing,that being said it did have it's moments.Overall I would say it an average movie.6/10.Maybe if your a guy and are into cars and racing you would enjoy it more.I would say it's definitly worth a watch if your a Jackie Chan fan."
4,Ghost Force predicts the here and now?,"I read this book in late 2009 and thought it a very good read, the story being set in 2010 and 2011.I also well remember the Falklands conflict of 1982 and many parts of the story depicted the inadequate military response that would be available now, bearing in mind the defence cutting by the British Government.Writing this review now (23 February 2010) it would seem Patrick Robinson may have either had inside information or was extremely adept at predicting the future!"
5,A latin jazz lover's concert dream,"Fernando Trueba has presented us with a lushly filmed and recorded valentine to Latin Jazz. Calle 54 is 54th street in New York, where the Sony studios are - and for these individual performances,these studios became like another country called Calle 54. The opening number, ""Panamericana"" features Caribbean and South American rhythms, with Paquito d'Rivera on clarinet and Milton Cardona, vocal. There's a bandoneon, awakening echos of Astor Piazzola, and what looks to be a Brazilian cavaquinho - a guitar-like instrument,and bata drums. Eliane Elias, a beautiful Brazilian jazz pianist, performs a swinging ""Samba Triste"". And the list goes on. Jerry Gonzales and Fort Apache are memorable, as are Chucho Valdez with his dad Bebo; Michel Camilo's fingers fly across the keyboard with the speed of light- there's Cachao,Puntilla Rios and more.Tito Puente gives us an energy-filled farewell, sounding as great as ever. What a cd."
5,The life of Jesus Christ,Well written easy to read. Covers complete life including year of obscurity. Also includes historical context in which events occurred.
1,This is the wrong battery for the Nikon One Touch Zoom 90,You have listed this battery as an accessory to the camera and now that I have purchased it I discover that this battery doesn't fit this camera. It is listed wrong.
1,dry and uninteresting,"I am a feminist and also very interested in the philosophical, linguistic and psychological intentions and positions of various feminist theories.This book reads like a high school history textbook, doing very little to consider the theoretical or historical considerations behind the cultures it examines. For example, 'In Egypt it was like this for women', next chapter 'In England it was like this'.If you are just looking for a perspective on what was going on with women at various times and places, and can keep yourself interested, this isn't so bad. If you want an enjoyable read, look elsewhere."
4,A good album,"I think this album is pretty good, I like every song on it, but my favorites are ""Suicidal Man"" and ""Something or Nothing"" I know this album has a reputation of being a bad album, but if you give it a chance I think it would be a good addition to your Uriah Heep collection, also I think its as good as ""Return to Fantasy""."
2,Too much partying!,"Uriah Heep ""Wonderworld"" #38 (1974).Their 7th studio album, ""Wonderworld"", just doesn't sound as good as past releases. ""Suicidal Man"", stands as one of Uriah Heep's classic rockers. The orchestrated ""The Easy Road"", is good also. Gary Thain's drug problems were getting worse as was David Byron who was drinking way too much. On tour Thain got a strong electrical shock onstage, and he fell into a deeper heroin addiction, before the band kicked him out. Thain died in 1975, at the age of 27. ""Return To Fantasy"", (1975) brought back some power and ex-King Crimson, Family bassist John Wetton."
5,A volume worth adding to the collection,"I'm not a heavy duty folk or celtic music fan; but I have found this series delightful. I loved volumes 1 and 2 in the series but didn't like 3 or 4 at all. With volume 5, Hearts of Space seems to be making up for the two previous duds with a volume as wonderful as the first one was. It's one of those CD's that you can play over and over again; and enjoy it every time."
5,OOP in JavaScript Flash,"I picked this book to help me further understand OOP in JSFL, which it did very well. ActionScript 2.0 and JSFL are similar enough to make this book a value to anyone wanting to get deeper into OO programming with JSFL."
5,FUN game for family game night!,"Once I figured out the directions for this game, it is a lot of fun! Similiarities to Yahtzee, with some differences in scoring. Actually thought it was harder to understand than Yahtzee, because there is more rules in Farkle. BUT, that said, once you learn it, you're hooked! My 8 year old daughter and I have a blast with this, as long as I keep score because I think it's a little copmlex for an 8 year old to score it."
3,"Nice to have, but not needed.","I like this game, it is fun and easy, but honestly while I did receive this for Christmas, you could just play with paper, pencil and dice. You don't need the box game to enjoy the game of Farkle. I still enjoy having it, but is isn't needed."
5,Family fun,If u like yahtzee you will enjoy this game. Very easy to learn and fun for entire family. Even my seven year old enjoys playing
4,Fun game,Gave this as a gift to my 12 year old niece. She enjoys games so this was a good toy. Fast shipping and would recommend.
4,A very spooky and cool action figure!,"I recently bought this action figure and i must say that i was really impressed with the high details that Mcfarlane Toys put on this early 70's shock rocker. From the creppy snake that wraps around alice cooper's body to it's very deatailed guillotine with a severd bloody head, all i can say it's just a phenomenal action figure to have if you are a big alice copper fan (like myself)..This toy is definitely not for younger children because of the graphic nature of a bloddy dismembered head, BUT it's definitely a good collector item for all die hard McFarlane Toys collector like myself."
5,Meet the browns season 3,Hilarious! absolute fun to watch. Can't wait to get season 4. Mr brown is so funny and the looks on his face during the episode are so funny.
4,"Great subject, but Perlstein needs a prose editor","This is an excellent book, on a subject not often addressed----the origins of today's right wing. I loved running across names we today know went on to assume very powerful political positions (Rhenquist, Jarvis, Cap Weinberger) etc., yet reading about these guys when they were just ""tots"" in the political process.Other fantastic background included the Knott's Berry Farm connection in a nascently fascistic Orange County! Who could've known the power of the...blackberry? Nixon, Rockefeller, Scranton and other so-called Republican moderates of the early 1960s were also maddeningly inept against the more ""extreme"" Goldwater supporters. Good drama here.My only gripe, and it came up again and again, was the writing. Perlstein isn't a bad writer, but he most definitely needs a talented editor in tow. Clumsy sentence structures that had to be read 3 times to understand started to get to me.But again, this is a great book that should be read."
2,It will break!,"The flash flood certainly has the best nozzle scheme i've seen recently, flash flood to drown, standard for conserving. It was a nice gun, until it broke within 2 weeks.Ever since Max-D was used in a water gun that didn't have plumbing problems (Like connecting hoses falling off aquapack devastators), the trigger spring (Which stops the water from coming out) falls off in a month or so. On this gun, since it uses 2 triggers and deals with rapid discharge, the trigger spring WILL fall off in a little bit.The CPS 1200 (5 or so years old) is one of the toughest things i've used. Even the toughest maneuver damage (Except dropping, maybe) can be taken without harm. The flash flood is the exact opposite. 1 hyperactive rampage, and it's gone!"
2,"Exciting, but underpowered","The 2005 Flash Flood has wimpy range. The flash flood nozzle may be powerful, but it empties your firing chamber in the blink of an eye. Here's a tip: cut out the mesh over the nozzle and you'll get, like, 10 feet better range. Probably a check valve freeze would bring up the range considerably, but I wouldn't know. My Flash Flood got 30 feet at the most. To state it simply, there WERE air-powered soakers that are better than this ""CPS"" soaker with a pint-sized pressure chamber. Some of the better soakers of the XP-line were better than this, but that's a separate rant. Oh yeah, it's got the Max-D style trigger system, so you know it's going to break in, like, a few weeks. I mean, if you see it on a Wal-Mart clearance rack for twelve bucks then, yeah, go for it, but don't pay full price for this sad excuse for a CPS."
3,Not for everyone,"This was one of the assigned readings for an English literature course at the University of Illinois, Navy Pier, Chicago, 1954-56. About halfway through the book the instructor gave up on this title, no one objected."
2,DO NOT LISTEN WHILE OPERATING HEAVY MACHINERY,"I put this on in the car today and almost missed my exit because I had drifted off. Not because of the music's beauty, but because of its monotony. Every song is sluggish and depressing. I love acoustic music, but there's no life here. Ron Sexsmith, who is on this album also does lots of acoustic songs, but he mixes it up a little. I bought this based on Shear's good track record as a writer and on his choice of duet partners. But there's no tune here that sticks with me. To top things off, Jules' singing is poor--his pinched voice is really irritating on this album. I have a couple other Jules Shear albums that I can recommend--especially his best of on Razor and Tie, but I think you should avoid this one."
3,Good for the price,"Pros: Transparent and somewhat easy to peel off once stuck onto paper. Price is good.Cons: Wish there were more colors available. 4 is not enough. Also, you cannot use a normal pen to write on them, need a sharpie or some type of permanent pen."
4,Great color-coding!,"We use these to color code our dates in food storage. This is wonderful! Our kids are told which color goes in front every time we create more food storage items. They help us rotate foods accordingly, think it is fun to learn food storage, and encourages our children to learn this skill with joy."
1,Poor Quality,"Not sure if my particular seller was selling seconds or not, but I would be surprised if Avery would allow such lackadaisical quality control. Several of my sheets of dots were clearly on the end of the ink run and were faded or had only partial coloring on them."
5,"FOR THE PRICE, IT IS GREAT","LOOKS AWESOME IN MY HOUSE. I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER. GREAT QUALITY FOR THE PRICE, AND LOOKS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN WHAT I PAID FOR. ALL IN ALL.. I AM HAPPY."
3,It's ok,"Good size, assembles easily. Table top though is not quality wood and although painted black, it comes across as a piece of just ok furniture. If I had seen prior to buying I would not have bought it."
2,scratches and dents,"After reading the reviews on this table, I took a chance hoping I would be one of the lucky ones. When I received it I was disappointed that I wasn't. All of the corners were scratched and a chip about one inch long was broken off of one of the corners. One of the underneath corners was cracked all the way through. I did give this a 2 because after taking a permanent marker and filling in the corners and having my husband put in a new piece of wood under the table, the table does look very nice. The cost to ship it back was not worth getting a new one. I will say for the price, this is a nice looking table. You should just be prepared that it may not come in perfect shape."
3,Good starting point,"I knew this book was dated when I ordered it so I got what I expected. I purchased it specifically for the purpose of understanding some of the perceptions of Kentucky (and Kentuckians) during the time it was written. I had hoped for more information on the pre-settlement history so was a bit disappointed on that front. I'm still searching for something told by the perspectives of American Indians about pre-settlement/pre-""frontier"" times...if you have suggestions, please share. The Clark book was fine for what it was intended to do, but don't expect to get an ""honest"" and ""unbiased"" report from reading it. It largely deals with the political aspects of Kentucky's formation as a state. For a history pre-dating that, you'll need to keep searching."
1,Judging a book,"This book is preachy, too simplistic for my four-year-old, and boring. As simple as the story-line is, it still makes no sense--why does the alligator stop stuttering just because he's repeating Creole's words? The characters are simple stereotypes. The moral at the end is a decent enough message, I suppose, but what's the point of this retelling? Worse than the Berenstein Bears!"
1,poor design and poor quality construction,This hole cutter is being made in China and sold by quite few companies for cutting holes. The cutter needs bars to screw in with different bars for different sized holes. When the threaded part of the bar breaks the tool is no good any more. The plastic shield is thin and need the plastic and pot metal brace to hold the cutter in place. The case is of recycled plastic and does not look like it will hold up very well.My foreman bought one for us to use and it worked ok but the shield has a hard rubber gasket and it scratched the ceilings when it was used and did not do a good job of catching the dust.If it sold for half the price it might not be a bad deal. We replaced it with an adjustable hole cutter that uses two blades and no bars to change. Much better.
1,yuck,"well, yeah, but cardboard is good, too, if you cover it with enough gravy. The only things worse than the recipes are the unctuous, syruppy commentaries. Eat sensibly, exercise, and avoid cook books which you might get more value from eating than from reading."
2,"Not ""good"" as said","I received the book quickly but it was in AWFUL condition... the cover is all torn and just about every single page has highlighting and writing that CANNOT be erased. its really a crappy deal that i received and I am super upset about it, I wish people would be honest and say when there book is is TERRIBLE almost not USABLE condition."
4,total 2 batteries,"The battaries are working great, I put them in my SLR camera and start using it immediately. I just get confused for the item description. This item is one pack containing 2 battaries, not 2x2 batteries. I was hoping some reviews will indicate this but there is not."
5,Skeptical at first but this product is great!,"I was skeptical as to whether this machine would hurt so bad that I could not use it but the pain is not that bad. Sure an epilator is going to hurt a little bit but it is worth the pain. By the way, maybe I have a high pain tolerance (I don't think that I do) but it didn't really hurt that much, more of a tickling sensation and of course some spots hurt more than others. This is such an awesome machine, it's like waxing but without the mess!"
1,Ouch,I have a pretty high pain tolerance but this thing hurts like nothing else. It moves waay too fast - I think if I had more control over the speed I might be able to deal with it better but there isn't that option. I think I'll stick with shaving.
4,Its good...,"Hi,I bought this product on suggestion of my friend. It was painful while it pulls hair the first time but then iam used to it now... i never go to a parlor noww...I like it though."
4,Braun 5270 Epilator review,I bought this for my girl friend.She has been using it for over a month now.It's really great.
1,Did not work,It tweezed about half the hair and cut the other half so I would still have to shave on a daily basis.
1,OUCH!!!,"Didn't remove all the hair. Quite painful. Redness lasted less than 1 hour. Overall, not impressed."
2,Braun 5270,"The first time I tried the Braun, I was very surprised at how little it hurt compared to waxing. The next day, I realized why: It seems to only be breaking off the hairs and not pulling the hair out from the root. To be fair, I decided to use it for 6 weeks and then decide on effectiveness. I have exclusively used the product once a week for 6 weeks and have seen no diminishing of hair and definitely no reduction on the need to shave. After 2 days I need to shave and by the end of the week I definitely need to do something with the hair on my legs. As far as effectiveness, it is no different than using an electric razor. It is slower than shaving (electric or otherwise) and since there isn't a difference in the need to shave, you are better off just shaving."
1,Ridiculously Painful,"Epilating is RIDICULOUSLY painful. While I'm sure this might be a good product, I used it once with the epilation tip and that was it. I could barely do a square inch, let alone an entire leg. Has worked great though with the shaving head. That's about all I'm gonna be using it for."
3,gave it a good try,"I was so excited to try this product after reading all the rave reviews. My leg hair is so coarse & thick that shaving always hurts and I have to do it every day. The pain was terrible the first time - like everyone says - but I was determined to do it. It does get less painful every time. However, I was doing it every day or every other day just to keep up. The ingrown hairs were horrible - I still have scars from them! I did exfoliate all the time but it didn't seem to help. I finally had to stop after 2 months of pain & suffering. Never again!!"
1,"Good concept, failed execution","The way this product removes hair makes for the perfect recipe for ingrown hairs, bleeding, scaring.... horrible product and waste of money."
5,beats a tweeze,"I just tried this epilator and it does a fantastic job. I have been using a tweeze but it only gets one hair at a time. Not to mention it uses batteries a big negative. This epilator does speed ""tweeze"" the hair out and it will hurt but after continued use it will not be noticeable. It beats shaving by far. I did try it on my upper lip and yes it hurt but it will get easier after a while of use as well. So I highly recommend this product and of course you can't go wrong with a Braun product haha that rhymed."
5,I love it!,"I just purchased this epilator today and already used it on both my legs and underarms. I'm a once a month waxer so I figured there could be some pain. Well I started with my legs and... no pain! I couldn't believe it so I turned it off, removed the roller cover and my gosh, tons of little hairs! It was working. So I tried my underarms. A little more pain but not nearly as much as I expected. Hubby felt my legs after and couldn't take his hands off them! Now that's worth it, when your hubby of almost 9 years is acting like he's just dating you again, lol. I'm going to try bikini line next. All in all, I LOVE this epilator."
4,not quite perfect,"I bought this on the advice of a friend. I do not find it very painful at all and went from beginner to expert within 2 uses. However, my legs do not feel silky smooth when I finish like my friend's. I am hairy and she is not so that may make a difference. I continue to use it and my legs feel OK (like the end of the day stubble only soft). I will keep using it and would buy another if this one quits."
1,Bad Ingrown hairs,"I have been using Braun, I love it, I decided to purchase a new one, read the reviews and bought this one.If you have coarse hair, please dont ever use this, after 3 months, I have had extremely bad ingrown hair and infected follicles.I had to actually pay so much to go to a salon and she removed the ingrown hair for me, and I still cannot seem to get all of them..I stopped epilators.. I am scared to go back.. I now shave and use Tend skin. Please dont buy this one.. you will have ingrown hair issues."
4,Braun Silk Epil 5270,Great product. I am glad I purchased it.Now I can wax at my free will. Dont need to go to a beauty parlour for this.
2,Not worth it,"I've been waxing for years. eventhough I've never professionally learned how to wax, I've learnt on the job, and I thought it would be the same with the epilator. I found it to be easy to use, but it's extremely painful, and my hair grew back a week later, where as with the waxing, it was much less painful, and it doesn't grow back for at least three weeks. really not worth starting with it."
1,OWCHIE!,"i bought this with really high hopes, and i was highly disappointed. I'm really sensitive to pain but i read a review that said it barely hurt at all so i tried it. OWCH. i cried while i was doing this it hurt so bad! I don't think that waxing is too awful but this thing was one of the most painful experiences of my life! i tried it on my lower calve and it got maybe 3 or 4 hairs and that was it. i kept going over and over but it would only get about 3 every stroke. it was a waste of time and money and it really hurt! i don't normally listen to reviews like this but trust me it's awful!"
2,Braun X'elle 5270,"I bought this for my friend who had a Braun epilator from Europe. She could not use it because the power requirements here were different to Europe and so decided to buy one here. The unit looked well made but on using it, did not pluck the hairs on her leg from the root but it was as painful as her European model. She attributes this to the fact that one side of the pincers was made of metal while the other side was plastic unlike her European model which had metal parts to both sides of the pincers. In less than a week, her legs were rough again unlike 3 weeks when she used her European model. She was disappointed that it did not do a good job like her European model and so returned it."
3,Effective But Still Flawed,"This epilator is effective in that it removes hair on the legs and underarms, but I would characterize it as a somewhat painful procedure. It is not a pain-free procedure as other reviewers have indicated; I can just barely tolerate it, and it doesn't seem to get any easier the longer that I've used this product. It also works for underarm hair removal, but that area is even more painful. It really does feel like someone is pulling out your hairs all at once, so some people will have a greater tolerance for this than others. I also tried it for bikini line hair removal, but that was too painful for me to tolerate. Bottom line is that it works well for leg/underarm hair removal, and the results last longer and are smoother than with shaving. The hair that grows back may be just slightly finer and lighter than with shaving. But if you have a low pain threshold, you might want to pass on this product."
2,No pain no gain. That is not the case,"It doesn't hurt , actuallly it is quite nice to use ( on legs) but it doesn't do a good job at taking the hair from the root . It cuts many hairs, so those hairs come back as if you have shaven them. I wasn't able to use it for underarms. It just doesn't take anything out. Bikini line , tried once , but I need to get more courage to try again. it takes about 5 strokes to get it right.Nice handle, wouldn't buy the same one again."
4,"Ouch, but it works.","I have never tried epilating before and the first 3 times I tried it on my legs, I nearly had tears in my eyes. After I got through the initial pain, it was like other reviewers said and the pain decreased significantly much as with plucking your eyebrows. I have attempted to do my underarms on a couple occasions, but it really did bring tears to my eyes, so I think I will have to think of alternatives for that area. I shudder to think what it would be like if I attempted the bikini area. I am really pleased with the results on my legs as my skin seems to be much smoother and I can go several weeks without having to worry about unsightly hair. Since my hair is pretty course and dark, it did take me several attempts to get a hairless leg. I have been using a body brush to exfoliate and have not yet had a problem with ingrown hairs."
5,much better than waxing!,I love this epilator. I am glad some of the reviews had tips on how to use it and that the pain would decrease after a while. The tips were very helpful since the product didn't really have much.
4,"Hurts a bit, but it works","Definitely a good item for this economy. I no longer pay to get my legs waxed so this saves a lot of money. See the hints in the other postings, they help"
5,**Fantastic**,"I have to say, after being a slave to shaving and waxing - this is fabulous! No, you won't get EVERY single hair off, but you know what - it's pretty doggone smooth. Initially it'll be a little uncomfortable but I use it every 2 days and have welcomed the little 'stings' as it means that the hair is being plucked. Make sure you take your time (do it while watching tv) and go slow so it's more effective.No more waxing or shaving for me!!!! Worth every dime!!p.s. I've got coarse thick hair."
5,Wasted YEARS using another model!,"I spent years using the epilator from Sharper Image, thinking ""it's Sharper Image, it must be great"". Then (thankfully) the quality started to drop, and I started looking for a replacement. This is FAR SUPERIOR to my other model. Prior to this model I had NEVER been able to use it on my legs - with this I can do both legs with shockingly little discomfort (notice I said discomfort, NOT pain.....it's amazing how little you feel). I noticed some other reviews mentioned the noise or the power cord being too short. I didn't find either of these issues to be a problem. I found it ergonomically shaped, and the little light was ingenius. Absolutely fantastic product! Better price through Bed Bath and Beyond, though, since you can use their 20% off coupons."
1,Not a good design,The attachments fall of as you are using it and you spend more time picking up the parts from the floor than using it. I returned it.
4,A good product,"This is a useful product for girls with lots of body hair! I bought it for my girl friend. But she was very lazy to use it. Anyways, we broke up after a while and I don't have any idea how the device works now!"
2,Not the first one I've had,"I'm not sure what the difference between this and my old Epilady is, but it just doesn't work as well.I noticed the little tweezers, one size is metal and does the motion, the other side is a stationary plastic wall. This is different than the Epilady which has a full-on tweezer action where both sides come together.All it does is cut off my hair - I might as well be shaving.I gave it more than one chance and it's just not doing what I need it to do so I'm returning it even though I will only be getting a partial refund.I am Asian, so I have pretty strong hair follicles, about medium to thin thickness. I would not recommend to anyone with similar hair."
1,Scary,"I wanted a product to get rid of my fine hairs after my No No device died. And let me tell you, I was scared from the minute I turned it on. The noise, the pain; this thing is a monster. Please someone suggest something that will work on fine hairs on the body as well as the face."
5,Hurt 20% Less Than I Thought,"If you are sick of shaving or can't afford getting your legs waxed, then I totally suggest buying this. I have only used it once (as it just came in the mail yesterday) but I love it."
5,Love this Epilator!!!!!!! But NOT painless,Who ever says this is painless is lying. Its very painful in the begining but as you go it does lessen considerably.
1,Not For Me but Obviously For Others...,"I have thin blond hairs on my legs. I tried this and it hurt quite a lot and it didn't remove very well at all.(I had to run it over the same area on my leg several times and even then it was not completely smooth). On top of that, i got the most horrid red bumps on the areas i used this product on, which was thankfully remedied with severe globs of jergens lotion. I think this works best on people with thicker hair maybe? because then the device can really grab the hairs. Anyway, you will be pleased to know that I returned it and got a refund (at least i was). Hope this review was helpful; Happy hair removing!"
4,Great epilator,This Braun epilator works much better than the older model I had. It seems to spin much faster and is more effective at removing the hair. I like the shaving attachment too. I took one star off because its still not perfect at removing all the hair and its very noisy too.
3,Painful but worth it...,"Even though this Epilator is very effective in removing hair, it was the most painful thing ever!!!!!! It took me nearly 3 days to finish both of my legs because I could NOT take the pain (maybe I had extra sensitive skin for it). All pain aside, It has been almost 3 weeks since I used the epilator and I have a lot less hair than ever before...I recommend it for its effective hair removal that can last upto 3 weeks, but the pain is something you'll have to take...pain is beauty so...good luck!"
2,Threads of in the pattern,same read as large volume books- disapointed thought would ge into more details. illustrations geared for the younger reader and not aware of this
1,More like the bottom of the barrel,"Despite some good production this album is a true disaster from start to finish. These guys have no talent what so ever. Stupid lyrical content, bad rhyming, lots of gimmicks, corny punchlines, and terrible performances are all over this CD. These guys are trying to act they are gangsta but tell me this, what gangsta makes a song with Bow Wow? This is not gangsta rap, this is an idiotic and disgusting geek show and an embarrassment to rap. If you want real A-Town rap, check out P$C or Boyz N Da Hood. This will most likely be headed to my list of 2006's worst albums."
1,Straight garbage.,"Another wack group to pop out of ATLDFB are just as wack as D4L.Plus this isnt crunk rap people. Its Snap rap, D4L are the same thing. They take really boring wack beats and spit wack rhymes over them. It takes no skill whatsoever.Listen to some real"
5,So nice to curl up with,"I am so glad my market had this on sale and I tried it. And, I love that I can order 6 boxes at once. It is naturally sweet, so no sweeteners are needed at all and the flavor is wonderful. For me, this is the best gift that anyone can buy me. I just wish my local market could carry the Egyptian Licorice with Mint so that I could taste it before jumping onto Amazon and ordering 6 boxes. I will keep looking. For another recommendation though (especially for those of us who like our caffeine), try the Yogi green tea with blueberry (they call it ""Slim Life"", but I bought it for the caffeine and blueberry)."
4,Pure Patchouli,"This smells like a dirty hippie...and that's a good thing! The bottle is tiny, but it packs a HUGE smell! A little goes along way and I really like this!"
2,No,"There are three settings for this device. Loud, louder, and loudest. I'll be returning it and getting something else. Something that is quieter and osculates."
4,air purifier,I am very satisfied with the Honeywell air purifier. It's not very noisy and people stopped mentioning the smoke odors. Thank you Amazon.
2,Cost too much,"I bought this and turned it on. Within a couple of weeks..less than a month, the red light came on indicating it needed a new filter. I opened it up to find it had 2 filters. The filters are over $11 dollars each. If you purchase this, go ahead and order the filters. You will be needing them soon. And I didnt notice that it did much. Very disappointing."
3,Non-permenant Hepa-type Filter,"Recieved the product today, opened the box, read the directions and found that the Hepa-type filter needs replacement every 6 months. Had we known this we would have continued to search further. The box and instructions both state that the Hepa and particle filters need replacement every 6 months during which they may be vac cleaned within that time period. I shop regularly with Amazon and hope that descriptions of products are double checked to ensure accurate information. Although we thought of returning the unit, we will keep due to the $20 return fee."
1,Not the right item as advertised,"After opening the box, I immediately knew that this wasn't the item that I bought as advertised online. I wanted a model with a permanent filter, as what was described in the product description, but what I received required 3 additional filters that had to be changed every 6 months. That can get spendy, so I sent it back, which I will say was pretty hassle free."
5,A Must Have for Rick Fans,"This cd has got to be one of my favorites. The well known singles are great ""Celebrate Youth"" ""Dance This World Away"" ""State of the Heart"", but you must listen to ""My Father's Chair"" - a tribute to his dad and follow up to April 24, 1981. You can just hear the feeling in his voice as he sings the words and plays his piano. Other favorites of mine are ""Walk Like a Man"" and ""Written in Rock"" about the struggles in his life. Add it to your collection; you won't be disappointed."
5,One of his best,"I also remember the video for ""Dance This World Away"". It was a classic which, sadly, was not seen by enough people. The same goes for the other 2 singles - ""Celebrate Youth"" and ""State of the Heart"". Like all the other songs on Tao, they're great. If you've ever been a Rick fan and you've never heard this album, you should give it a chance. A true turning point for Rick and a great musical achievement."
3,Vampire 101: Self-Analysis for Self-Preservation,"Engaging and interesting. I enjoyed ALL the characters, the writing style and especially the format: both in that the story was told from various characters' perspectives, and also in the way the main character's life is compartmentalized in his own analysis. I liked the introspective aspect, and the self-realization at the end.However, the inherent detachment, which I believe significantly adds to the novel's appeal, also has the unfortunate effect of slightly distancing me emotionally, meaning the novel probably won't leave a long-lasting impression in my mind... hence three instead of four stars.Still, definitely worth reading!"
5,Excellent Primer Textbook,"I'm an absolute beginner in makeup, even though I'm in my 30's. My recent interest in Theatrical makeup led me to buy this book. I was EXTREMELY delighted to find clear pictures presented on a variety of faces and skin types. The book is layed out very like a college text with examples and exercises. I found it VERY useful in developing a solid foundation (hee hee!) in doing my own and others makeup."
3,good for the price,VERY cheap and the product is decent for the price i paid.. product is used daily
1,Not what is pictured,"First of all the covers are not black with a grey highlight, they are a brownish see-through color with painted on black highlights.Second I bought the brown one as well which was the exact same color and cheap see-through silicone material only without the black highlights painted on.So rather than getting one brown and one black I got two miscolored cheap covers, neither of which look remotely anything like the pictures. I am very disapointed since the shipping costs have all gone down the drain as well."
2,The Missing Cross-Refference,"While it had many things listed and perhaps they might be interesting to someone, there was a lack of organization or lack of a cross-refference."
2,Sizing not accurate,Sizing was not accurate. Had to send back the medium and order a large for a foot that wears a size 9.
5,Very good text book....,Very good text book....I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more about reading/writing in an academic environment.
2,"product ok, timeliness terrible","It took far too long for this book to arrive (over three weeks), and i'm pretty sure i paid for expedited shipping to boot. When it arrived, the cover was in rough shape, but i always prepare myself for the worst when purchasing used books (even if the seller's notes say its in good condition). Again, my biggest (and really only) issue was the fact that i had to wait over three weeks for a textbook that i needed a week after i ordered it."
4,Great Compilation - but ...,"Most of the Songs are great but the majority of Elvis Fans have them already on other compilations, that`s why i only gave it 4 stars. I think i have to correct the guy from Southampton/UK, because the Beatles also sold more than one billion records (Source: Guinness Book of Records), but within a shorter period of time (active recording career 1962 - 1970 compared to Elvis` recording career 1954 - 1977) and Elvis released more records, that`s why he has more Gold records certifications in the U.S."
2,Missing some of the essentials,"Where is ""Blue Christmas"", ""Peace in the Valley"", and ""Kentucky Rain""? I find it hard to believe that this CD set can capture the essence of the man without containing his most famous Christmas song, his most famous gospel song, and one of his best country songs."
1,A brief Comment on Sail Power,"The first chapter was difficult to follow, and, I believe, was incorrect in its truncated description of how a sail works.The second chapter was also difficult to follow so I gave up and resorted to Peter Hahne's book, Sail Trim: Theory and Practice"", which was helpful for this controversial and complicated topic."
2,The language I was interested in is not on the CD!!!!,"I just bought this cd because I am learning Haitian creole, and that's one of the languages that is supposed to be on this cd. When I installed it, I was unable to find anything on the CD in Haitian creole, even though it is listed as one of the languages on the case. So it has been a complete waste of money for me, perhaps if I was interested in the other languages I could give it more stars.It also says in the blurb that u can use any of the 16 languages as the source language, but that is not possible either, u can only chooose a few of the languages as your source. I am very disappointed in the false advertising for this product. If anyone can find creole on this cd I would be happy to stand corrected.PS I contacted IMSI and they say the cd's were mislabelled, there is no haitian creole on the cd, despite the fact that it is listed on the cover."
1,car seat handles,For the mom who wrote about the handles. You're absolutely right. We purchased an Evenflo seat before our daughter was born and the instructions specifically said that the handle is not to be up while driving. It's supposed to lay flat along the top of the seat (as if you were rocking them). The police officer was right in telling you that and although we're looking at purchasing a Graco stroller for our second child I'm dissapointed that their rep. said otherwise. She must not have known what she was talking about.
2,24 hours at Indy Dvd. Behind the Scenes at Fans At Indy.,"Not much racing, just A look At Indy, It's fans, some preparations and the before and after and during of the race. Ok Little bargain , I brought it for $2 at a Big Lots.It is a bit boring.."
5,Violation,Absolutely one of the best novels I have read. Very hard to put this one down as you become so involved with the story.
4,"Taut, gripping!","Thea Aubin, survived rape victim and coma patient, has put up so many fences around herself that it is a miracle she can leave her home to try to rescue her son, David, who has been kidnapped by someone connected to the original ""violation"" that left Thea nearly dead and impregnated. The author is able to convey the horror of her rape so chillingly that it is unforgettable. The action slowed for me when Thea and Jack reached Long Island to track down the rapist because it started feeling a little bit predictable, but I did enjoy the relationship between Jack and the wounded Thea (damaged as she is, could anyone really have a long term relationship with her? Another book)."
3,A Page Turner,"Being a fairly new fan of Darian's, I have to first give props to her for this book. It took me a while to get really interested in the characters, but after the plot thickened, I began much more intrigued. This book covers a very serious, and disturbing topic, but it winds itself into a web of excitement that kept me reading. Although the ending was quite predictable, I am still going to continue to read her novels.Oh-and the chat room conversations WERE quite ridiculous. Who would print those out anyways?"
4,A Bit Convoluted But Very Interesting,"The plot was very interesting though sometimes a little unbelievable. There were a lot of characters and various relationships among them which made it a little difficult to follow. I had to reread portions to refresh my memory on names and what roles they played HOWEVER,those are the negatives. Overall the book very much held my attention. The story was a good one and the main characters were well developed. I certainly would recommend it."
2,POOR RESEARCH,"This author took a good story and ruined it for me by failing to research the simpelist of things such as Airport Security(no guns on planes), Law(statute of limititation on rape)and court procedure(reversing convictions). A romantic willing to overlook these things will probably enjoy this book. As a retired police officer it made no sense."
3,Romeo and Juliet meet Vietnam.,"Not the greatest performance by Ken Wahl, potraying a brooding, Navy surgeon at a field hospital who falls for a widowed nurse serving elsewhere in the conflict in Vietnam. Ladd as always delivers and she's not hard to look at, to boot. Somewhat predictable storyline but its strengths are that it doesn't bog down so it holds its entertainment value. Not a bad film if you like movies about lovers separated by the trials of war. Bring your tissues... and a bag of munchies."
4,What a GEM of a movie !!!,Why isn't this movie available from amazon?Why is the price from 2nd party sellers soridiculously high.I did a review of this movieon vhs several years ago and asked everyonewho wanted this out on dvd to click yes if this was a helpful review.91 out of 91 said yes.So I again ask all of you to say yes if you want this dvd at a reasonable price.
1,A Horrible Book about A Great Man,"Despite having an accurate title and being the most recent biography of George H. Thomas this book was the pits. The author relies too much on primary sources and battle reports and thus takes the exciting story of a Virginian who fought for the Union during the Civil War into an unreadable mess. I am glad to see books written on Thomas, however this one is a major disappointment."
1,Utter fraud,"""Sorority House Scandals"" may be the single greatest fraud in the history of commercial videotape. It is presented as if it's an actual movie, with actors and actresses and a director and plot and dialogue and at least minimal production values. (One plot description mentions that the sorority girls order their ""pledges"" to make skimpy costumes.) But this ""movie"" contains neither sorority house nor scandal. No dialogue either. The picture is instead merely the amateurish taping of an ""emcee"" on a stage (no audience is ever shown) with several girls who take turns removing their tops and jiggling a bit. What did it cost to make this picture? Well, if the girls were lucky and were hired for $50 each (and actually got paid), the emcee worked for free, the camera man got a case of beer, and they slipped the janitor $20 to let them in the auditorium for a couple of hours . . . they overspent.The only scandal is that this production was ever marketed. It is a scam, pure and simple."
3,"OK, but I expected better....","I recently tried out the Cross Blue Jumbo Ballpoint refill (medium point), and while it isn't terrible or anything, it is not as good as I expected it to be. The ink tends to skip and is also completely different from other Cross ballpoint inks (all the others put down a very deep, dark blue line, while this one puts down a very light blue line). The refill does write very smoothly, but it's just not the quality I expect from Cross. I did notice that this refill says ""Made in Germany"" on it, while most Cross products are produced in China now, so maybe that is the reason for the lack of consistency of this product in relation to the rest of their products."
4,Nice addition,I use this as an additive to green tea or oolong. It's a soothing addition that takes it up a notch.
5,Tasty goodness,Being a Acid refluxer this stuff is great right after dinner. I noticed it helped me considerably so I came on here and got the 6 boxes for cheap.
5,WOW!,"Oh my goodness! I knew that I'd purchase the ""Hero"" cd, but I read the Amazon reviews,anyway, prior to my purchase-- I hoped that the reviewers were right. They didn't lead me astray. This cd is an incredible blessing-- the best part is... it keeps on giving. The first day, all the songs were good by day 2 ""my song"" was ""Imagine Me""...(yes, I cried...several times) but now, ""First Love"" is working on me. Okay, enough of my business. Kirk Franklin's ""Hero"" is a worthwhile investment, it will richly bless you. Go get it! :o)"
5,Hallelujah!,"I'm not the type who does reviews, but this was powerful. I've loaded it onto my I-Pod so I can listen to it to and from work.Looking for you and Hero just lift you to a higher place and After a while, Brokenhearted and Without You bring you to tears. Jesus be praised, he is high, exalted and lifted up!"
3,Good CD,"This cd is not my particular favorite, but it is good anyway. This album is very hard core. It seems to have heavy feel to it.It has more of a Hip Hop flavor than gospel to me. I miss the good choir songs Kirk use to put out. This album is average when compared to his other works. I don't really hear any powerhouse choir songs on this album.I'll wait for the next album to come out."
5,Awesome,"I have not stopped playing this cd since I received it. Of course, ""Looking for You"" is an all-time favorite but I am sold on the title track ""Hero"". When I think about a hero, this song let's me know that the hero of my life is Jesus Christ. I hear the deliverance from Kirk on this cd and and I thank God for it. This is one of Kirk's best projects. To God be the glory!"
4,The Appeal,"I love this cd and how Kirk recalls his past only to get over it not dwell in it on ""Let it Go."" ""The Appeal"" is a song that is for me everyday I wake. Even though I usually stay with the older spirituals and listen to few mainstream gospel songs/groups, this cd turned my head and I wasn't upset."
3,Hero CD,The CD case was cracked and came apart but it did not seem to affect the music on the CD which was more important
1,Look for quality literature elsewhere,"I had to read this book for a class in the book of Revelation. I could bearly force myself to get through the book it was so bad. The characters were flat, the story line terribly predictable, the dialogue was boring, and it couldn't have been written at more than a third grade reading level. I noticed all this and I'm an engineering student not an english major!"
2,Badly written,"I did not even finish this book, got to about 2/3 of it and just breezed through the ending. Only read it because my bestfriend recommended it. Badly written, dry and slow, in no way can Pat's style compare to my favorite Christian fiction writer, Frank Peretti (although the Oath was a bit disappointing)."
5,How can you not like a classic,"I originally bought this ring in dark pink, loved it so much I went back and bought another and then added the white and light pink. Size runs slightly larger which is great for me since I am not a true 8. The service is great too."
2,Too Slick..,These are extremely thin and slick and would not recommend them to anyone..A waste of money..
3,Classic Movie,"Picture color/resolution is a bit flat but not distracting. I have always enjoyed Rebecca De Mornay's acting and saw the original in a theater years ago. Given today's standards And God Created Woman would probably get a ""PG"" rating."
1,Dont waste your money,I was excited about this DVD after the positive comments I saw. I though it would be more about stretching (Yoga and Pilates) than what it is. It just jumps into moves without any explanation and is too fast paced. You can't take your eyes off this video which makes it hard to do the actual moves they want you to do. The movements just aren't explained well at all.
4,Good Value,I ordered 3 replacement blades for my lawn mower. The item was of good quality at a reasonable price.
2,"Half Good, Half Bad","I had a good time in 2006 and half of 2007 till itbroke after buying TWO of them. I LIKED HOw the eyes go up and how it exploded but I WAS mad at super soaker for not making it right. If you do not want to waste your money, DONT buy this!"
4,Fun toy but breaks easily,"I bought 2 of these years ago on sale for $4.00 at walmart and they were really fun....before they both broke. I was only out 8.00 so no big deal, but disappointing because they were so much fun. They lasted maybe a week before both had the same problem. they stopped spouting the water. Too bad the insides are so cheap because it really is a fun toy."
5,Toy,"This is a fun toy for my kids[...], my kids have worn their's out over the past three summers, but at these prices not only will I not buy it here but I won't buy from that seller at all. [...] I will repost if I can find the sprinkler anyplace that doesn't take advantage of people."
2,Not worth paying over 10 bucks,"I got this in the summer for our Summer splash wetdown party for all teh neighborhood kids. It worked for a good 10 minutes and then it just stopped working. THe blast is very predictable but every so often it woudl malfunction and lose pressure to blast out water and it woudl simmply just run over instead of blasting. My husband took it apart to fix it and found that once it stops blasting it overflows on the inside causing a loss in pressure and a ""spill over"" in the water So bascially it broke"
4,Do not pay $[...] for this!,"Good grief! $200+??? Even Hasbro says it's only $17.99. These vendors are ripping people off. Look around on the web or in your hometown and get it for under $[...]. *shakes head in disgust*That said, this sprinkler ROCKS! We got one a few years ago, but a party guest broke it. :-( So we are on the hunt for another one. I'm not a fan of sprinklers, but I love this one!"
2,Isn't technology supposed to improve life?,"Ms. Jackson's work is poetic, but the storyspace hypertext format is more convoluted than helpful. By the time you've gotten to the second section of the book you begin wishing that it was something that could be read with ANY other browser. By the time you get to the third section...aw heck, I just gave up.What a disappointment. I loved the ideas that inspired her, but the technology not only got in the way of the reading, but of her writing. I would only suggest someone buy this if they want to be turned off of e-books completely."
4,Another Maisy book recommended,My 18 months old likes Maisy and she enjoyed this book. Its too bad she started pulling off flaps.
3,"Great audio, lousy construction","I love the audio I get from these headphones, but the construction is not great. The plastic is fairly cheap and feels flimsy. The battery cover had a tendency to fall off. And I left one of the pair on top of a hot stero turner for awhile and that seems to have fried the battery.On the other hand, these headphones are a marriage saver in that I can watch my action movies happily without disturbing my wife.For the price, I wish they were better built, but they DO perform if youa re careful with them."
3,A good book -- but a little misleading.,"The book is good -- for an advertising piece for landscaping plans. It is well illustrated and does include a lot of information on landscaping. It helped me. HOWEVER, each landscaping plan has an 800 number with a plan code. For $45 plus the company will send you a detailed plan that is adapted to your zone. Frankly I would have preferred to know this up front. I should have been more suspicious when I saw the low book price. Would I recommend the book? Yes - if you want some ideas about achieving different looks in a suburban garden. But unless you are willing to pay more, don't look to this guide for plant recommendations."
3,rest in sleaze,this cd is so awesome! go swedish rock! another good swedish band to check out is loud n nasty.
3,Could be better,"I love the way the car sear looks! Finally something cute and pink for a girl. But I am unhappy with the sun shade...it doesn't move back and forth very easy and the hooks/holder keeps popping off. Plus for some reason it has a strange yellowing in the fabric now!? This car seat was for my 7th baby, so I have tried an infant seat or two in my day....I've been happier with the others."
5,Love this book,I love this book i think it was writen for kids but still a great read.I have Alaskan Mal called Balto !!!!
4,ROCK ANTHEMS,Excellent collection of some of the best hard and heavy rock tracks ever. The big effort of collecting them all become absolutely vague when you open the booklet and realize there is no information on the bands and the whole design of the album.
2,Shirt Sizes Lie,"The product in itself is great, good crisp picture not an iron on so will last through many washings, but my major flaw with this product isn't the product so much as the sizes. The seller of these shirts needs to better understand sizes and the groups they belong to. I ordered an Extra Large figuring it would fit me a woman who likes to breath in my clothes lets say and allow for shrinkage in wash. What they neglected to say was it was a Jr. Ex Large. Something I have not been since 7th grade. The sizing button did not work something I wish had as I would have liked a chart explaining sizes. I think it should be with all clothing products, a size chart, even it it's just chest measurements at least explain without going to a page that may not work, put sizes these clothes fit. I have resolved to keeping this shirt in hopes one day a grand child will wear it. Only have to wait oh 8 more years."
3,Moving but excessively grim,"The Emigrant Novels are a riveting, deeply moving story but at the same time unrelentingly grim and sad. Yes, these people had very hard lives but that was normal for the 19th century. Leaving one country and going to a new one far away was terribly difficult but considering the circumstances it was the best thing to do. People are not trees; rather than having roots they have feet and anyone who can't use them with courage, then or now, is done for.I liked ""Pelle the Conqueror"" much better. Pelle has a very difficult life but he faces it bravely and never looks back."
5,"An emigrant epic of torment, hard work and persistence","How wonderful to hear the story of our ancestors through the writing of one of Swedens best writers. We follow a group of emigrating Swedes closely as they make the enormous move from Sweden to America. This emigrant epic reminds you of how things have been, and who Americans are. I emigrated from Sweden to America like they did, only more than a hundred years later. Foremost, I feel that Moberg captures the torn inside of an emigrant fenomenally, many tears were shed while reading of the torment Kristina feels. It's as true today as it ever was, and the author tells exactly how I and many others feel having left one land to be part of another. The books are splendid reading, you can't put them down."
5,The Emigrants a real eye opener!,"I bought this book because I've recently visited Sweden again and, for the first time, went to Stockholm. I went to Skansen - an open air museum - where I saw how my Swedish ancestors lived before my g-g-grandfather emigrated to Australia. I wanted to know more and so my Swedish 3rd cousin suggested I read this book.Well, she wasn't wrong! Not only is it a great read but, through anecdotes about people in the village of the main characters, I learned a huge amount about how they lived, what they thought, how they laboured and - more importantly - why they emigrated. I was only going to read the first book, as these characters travel to America and not Australia, but now I'm hooked and want to see how they adjust to their new life in America which they were totally naive about. I'm off to buy the other three books before I die of curiousity!"
4,Enjoyable read,Purchased this book as a gift but have heard from the receiptant that she loves it. She being of Swedish descendant loves learning about the strife the swedish people endured and seeing the courage it took to leave their home.
3,it's okay,"I'm not really a fan of the flavor and I think it gives me a sore throat. I'd like to think it works, but I don't think I'll be buying another pack for the reasons I've already listed."
3,"Uncomplicated, quick read","In the beginning, first 60 pages or so, I said that I was going to really like this book. Then Coulter started padding the prose with unnecessary dialog and extra details that did not add to the storyline. I did finish the book in one day as it was an uncomplicated, quick read."
2,FBI thriller???,"I have read the first 7 books of this so-called ""FBI suspense thriller"" series. They are little more than romance novels with a bit of murder and mayhem added. Every story is the same formula: woman (who is too thin, with unruly hair) is in distress, man saves her from all evil, they fall in love in less than a week, the end. Snoooooooze."
3,No surprises,"This book was enjoyable and the plot moved along quickly. Characters were somewhat contrived as was the whole ending. I hate when they do that. The love story in it was totally predicatble and as I said, the ending was so unrealistic that I stopped reading the last chapter - why bother? The good guys always win and the bad guys get theirs. The main female character should have been dead so many times that towards the end you are rolling your eyes and thinking, yeah you go Rambo...If you don't mind those predictable story lines then this one is for you"
2,Lost Appeal,I have read many and many of Catherine Coulter's books and have enjoyed them immensely. I have to say that this book was not what I had expected of her. It had a good plot with very few twists and a decent ending. The characters were very undeveloped and dialouge was not good. By the middle of the book I already knew who was behind both of the killings. It didn't explain enough about the crime scene or about the findings.The romance and the mystery was left out. The characters didn't communicate that well and definetly no romance.It is a decent book to read when nothing else is going on.
1,"Catherine Coulter's ""Eleventh Hour"": Duty or Deadline?","Speaking as a fan of Catherine Coulter's previous detective novels, I am disappointed in this product. I wish I didn't feel compelled to refer to it as such, but the ""Eleventh Hour"" seems indeed to be a book that was written for commerce, and at the last moment to appease an editor. As with Iris Johanson's recent books, we have another writer with a fine imagination who has left her work poorly crafted. It might have been an acceptable first draft, but in truth, I feel even that is being kind."
2,Not Her Best,"I LOVE Catherine Coulter, but this book left me cold. The ""mystery"" was very predictible and the main characters wooden. I was especially put off by the dialogue; it just did not seem to fit the context or the characters. I'm sure I will continue to read Catherine Coulter - when she's on, she is one of the best of the genre. This, sadly, was not one of her better efforts."
5,Love the FBI series,"A friend got me interested in Catherine Coulter and the FBI series. Have read them all and look forward to more, In fact, it's about time for another!!!"
2,"sadly, not too thrilling",I was very disappointed in this new book by Catherine Coulter. It was overly long and I like long if there is a good story. The mystery wasn't much of a mystery. But my biggest complaint is that the characters were so cardboard. What happened to the way she used to write when you cared about the characters. These FBI couples are totally unrealistic and not interesting. I think this will probably be my last Catherine Coulter book. I haven't really enjoyed any of her books in quite a while.
5,I played keyboard on the same session,"A disco classic. I played, too, on the session (keyboards)....assuming the previous reviewer is Mike L. or Louie P. / greetings!Will Crittendon was in the booth playing an imaginary tiny guitar,shouting 'It gotta' be TIGHT! gotta be TIGHT!'....which it was.Got onto the charts but the promotional operation was not in placeat SMI records to do much with it."
2,Poor quality,It looks like bender but has very little bobble to it. The glue that holds the feet to the base gives way if it gets warm and fell apart. I can probably get some super glue and fix it myself rather then deal with mailing it back.
5,Amazing and beautiful,"What a beautiful story! I loved the videography, the music, but most of all, I loved that young boy! Truly amazing! Bravo REX! Thank you 60 Minutes for creating such a moving and inspirational story in these times when we are surrounded by so much heartbreak and bad news.Rex: A Mother, Her Autistic Child, and the Music That Transformed Their Lives"
1,The world's most beautiful woman is unknown.,"I was very dissapointed by this dvd. I was expecting to see the most beautiful woman in the world. Aishwarya Rai maybe a top actress of Bollywood but She is not the most beautiful woman in the world. Her look is quit common---blue/green eyes, dark hair, 5'7--- she looks a bit funny and ordinary like most woman you see on the street. 60 minutes may want to do a more intense search to found the most beautiful woman in the world. A note to 60 minutes ""The world's most beautiful woman"" is a model whom I see in my native Europe on many billboards, her name is unknown."
2,Overrated,"Although the Goodie Mob's intentions are admirable--they aren't your stereotypical stick-up kids with a mic--this album is a failure. It's just not that listenable. I'm a big fan of their first joint, ""Soul Food,"" but the electro-techno production they adopted this time round just doesn't do it for me. Nor do their rhymes--on ""Still Standing,"" they've gotten a little too preachy, a little too pretentious. They've always walked a fine line in that regard, and now they've crossed it, sad to say.Frankly, the album comes across as cheesy and overblown. For something in the same vein, but better, go with Outkast or the Mob's earlier effort."
5,one of hip hop's top 5...fa'real...,"...still standin...hard to believe this album is 3 years old. i still be playin this like its new! this is music i play whenever i have some heavy moods and thoughts to purge through...'black ice', 'inshallah', 'beautiful skin', 'the experience'...every song...classics!""soul food"" was tight...but this right here, is that true southern dirt!"
5,"""The Little Prince"" with an ancient Egyptian twist","The special blend of child-like innocence with profound wisdom contained in ""The Story of Bes"" reminded me of Antoine De Saint-Exupery's classic, ""The Little Prince"". The future of the human protagonist in each story appears rather bleak until the unexpected encounter with a small, otherworldly character. In ""The Story of Bes"", Andy does not encounter a petite blond-haired traveler from a faraway asteroid who asks him to draw a sheep, instead he finds himself face-to-face with the immortal Bes, pint-sized warrior of ancient Egyptian legend, who has journeyed to the New World on a quest to recover a lost papyrus scroll pilfered from its ancient homeland years ago. It is while vying for control of that scroll that Andy first learns the special story it contains...and it is there that the magic begins...."
3,My favorite cookbook!,"If someone told me I could only keep one of my cookbooks I would select this one without hesitation. Each recipe gives you a little history of how that cookie came to be. I never had a cookbook in which I loved every recipe until now. I have made MANY of the recipes in this book and they were all fabulous! Macraroons to die for, peanut butter chocolate cookies. I originally bought this cookbook because I wanted a good recipe for black and whites (a New York staple) and this book has now become my baking bible. Whenever I am going to a party I look through this one first.Nancy Baggett's directions are so easy to follow too, so you won't get tripped up. Try it, you'll love it!!"
3,"Haven't watched it yet, but....","I haven't watched it yet, but i have looked at the posted contents of the release. I can definitely say that I am a little disappointed at some left out yet underrated classics. Junkyard Dog vs. Ric Flair for the world title in 1990, Lex Luger vs. Rick Steiner for the world title, Scott Steiner vs. Ric Flair for the title, and Bobby Eaton vs. Flair in a 2/3 falls match were all classics that we may never have seen on PPV's but got the rare chance to see some of these guys get a main event match for the title. I hope they release some more volumes, but I'm not holding my breath."
4,Ex-Pistol Kicks ***,"If you don't know this guy, you've been under a rock for two decades. As the guitarist for the Sex Pistols, Steve Jones penned the memorable riffs to such unforgettable punk classics as ""Anarchy in the U.K."", ""God Save the Queen"", and ""Pretty Vacant"". This solo effort is no exception.Originally released in America in 1989, it features 12 tracks of pure power. ""Freedom Fighter"" is a hot spot, as is ""We're not Saints"", co-written with Nikki Sixx. Nikki isn't the only artist who helped out as Axl Rose and Ian Atsbury of the Cult sing on the new version of ""I Did U No Wrong"". The album ends on a good note, with his cover of ""Suffragette City"", which I even dig more than Bowie's original.Even if you aren't a Pistols fan, I highly recommend this album. If you like AC/DC, GNR The Cult, or Hanoi Rocks, this little known gem is the record for you."
4,Cheesy 80's Hard Rock from the Original Pistol!,"Fire and Gasoline (1989) was Steve Jones' second (and his best) solo album. Several members from other 80's hair bands (Motley Crue, Guns N' Roses & The Cult) help him out throughout the album. The best tracks are ""Freedom Fighter"", ""Fire and Gasoline"", ""We're Not Saints"" and a Sex Pistols cover song ""I Did U No Wrong"" (co-vocals by W. Axl Rose). In general the songs are not very brilliant, a bunch of pop throwaways. But altogether they're a hard hitting album filled with Steve Jones' trademark guitar crunch and solos. A far cry from his first album.After he quit living the punk lifestyle, Steve grew out his hairand got off the white horse and became a hair band rocker.Fire and Gasoline is pretty good disc, you'll be thumping along with these songs after a couple of listens.Highly recommended."
3,Lebrie gets even more angry about something i dont careAbou,"Out of all people of DT to make a solo effort Labries, Elements of Persuasion brings the ball and chunk. big sledgehammer guitar riffs, futuristic keyboard effects, vibrant tempoed percussion, Labrie jells pretty well with this heavy wall of sound. its pretty unusual seeing the opera man dabble in futuristic-eque metal hijinks in the tradition of soilwork but he manages to pull it off alright.it gets kind of same-y though and the bridge solos and vocal harmonies are sometimes the distguishment between the songs. elsewhere Labrie solo-project company also dabble in some midtempo piano numbers which somehow sound better here mainly cuz there restrained and dont aim to be the big and pompus like the way his main band aproaches material of the sort"
5,Struggled with microscopic colitis,"And this answered all my questions. I knew what foods to eat, what to avoid, and how to figure out the food path that was right for me. Great info on supplements. This book is a lifesaver."
2,Way too Technical,This book is full of information if you have a PhD. For the average IBS sufferer like myself the information was not all that helpful.The lists are confusing and some contradict eachother. I'm still searching for a better book.
2,Just OK,This book is mostly a review of literature and interviews conducted by the writer who sees to have written many other diet books for chronic illnesses. Did not like its contents much.
1,Save Your Money,"This book is a huge disappointment. It's poorly written and completely ignores events in season 7. The whole purpose of this book seems to extoll the wonders of B/A4eva. If you're a Spike or Buffy/Spike fan, don't bother even picking it up as it will raise your blood pressure. The author should make a public apology to all the fans who loved and were emotionally moved by the Buffy/Spike love story."
4,For all Buffy Lovers....,"This book was sooo cool! If you're a Buffy freak like me :) It has all kinds of cool extras in it, not just episode recaps. It has quotes, trivia and much more! I would definately reccomend buying this. It does only have seasons 5-7. This and the other Watcher Guides I'm sure..will help keep Buffy alive!!"
5,Calculated Liberty,"This band is all about juxtaposition. In West Coast Boogaloo, the Allstars produce an incredibly tight and unified groove, all the while peppering it with badassedly loose and liberated abandon. Bouncy, flowing basslines, coupled with the light touch and tasty hi-hats workings of Zak Najor on drums lay the ground work for this disc. Sprinkled on top are lively horns, simple but effective guitars, and hot keyboards. Karl Denson leads the group, donating mind-blowing flute solos and soulful sax runs. The only drawback to this band is when Denson attempts to sing. Each member gets the opportunity to solo in almost every song, giving a free, fresh and `flying by the seat of your pants' feeling. Tight, free, big, funky, exciting, fast - you choose. This album is the band's crowning achievement and is not be missed."
1,Johnny stecchinio,Can not view movie. It's not for United States DVD players. That sucks. I paid for this movie and can't even watch it.
2,Not in English,"Had to return but my own fault, did not realize this does not have english subtitles. Would love to speak Italian but I don't!"
4,Great for beginners and intermediate traders,"This is a great book. Elder covers the psychology of trading and crowd behavior, risk management, and technical analysis. Written for the novice and intermidiate level trader, its all in this book."
1,you gotta be kidding?,"I had traded successfully for several years before reading this book. I found doing exactly the opposite of what Elder recommends is the way to succeed as a trader. I bought a black box system and stuck with it through some rough times. But for the last three years it has consistently produced high five figure income for me, without really having to think about it."
2,BUY Market WIZARDS INSTEAD!!,"Market Wizards are the books you want to read. I read the 2 market wizard books 1st then read this book. The wizards books if full of the most fascinating, hard to EVER put down reading I have ever done. They have taught me so much. Then when I got to this book it was as if I was on my 1st day of trading and never knew about charts, fundamentals, P/E's and other basics and then some more advanced chart readings, asset allocation, when to place stops, protecting what you have not what isn't there. Read Market Wizards and then if you want more reading get this book. I found that it was overpriced 1st of all and the Wizards provided more valuable information.In Summation this book is good if:1) U buy it Used2) You have never invested before3) You don't know from charts to getting hurt by stock price movement4) Never read any other quality books about investing."
1,Garbage! Don't buy this book!,I tossed mine in the recycling bin rather than donate it to the library book sale. What a piece of trash this book is. All these old trading maxims and catch phrases are really a lot of hogwash. Save the price of this book and buy a lotto ticket. The risk/reward is better.I've bought a lot of investment books. This really is the worst. The positive reviews here make me seriously question the legitimacy of amazon book reviews.
5,Content Rich,"As with all good books, this one speaks to you on multiple levels. As a beginner 3 years ago, it was one of the first books that really made sense to me. Now, as a veteran trader I find additional insights every time I browse through it again. In between, it has helped refresh, reenforce, and remind me of lessons you just can't understand without actual experience. One of the best books in my trading library."
4,Good Book to Start With,"Nicely written, from a market psychology perspective. The basic technicals were well explained, though more elaboration on centering moving averages would be desired. Seems most ema's in his examples are for the current day, not pushed back a couple of days, as was advised earlier in the discussion. I would like to see an update to include options an futures, any more applicable and recent technical indicators, and more on money management strategies. But it is a good book to start with, easy to read, and I still recommend it."
2,Useless for traders,"This is probably one of the most overrated books about trading. When reading this book, you get the opinion, that Mr. Elder isn't a trader himself and doesn't really know, what he is talking about. This book is useless for traders, but it shows, that someone, who isn't able to trade for a living can still make a living writing books about it. It is well known, that vast amounts of money are made day after day by very few professionals because of books like this which promote an illusion. Anybody who is able to trade for a living doesn't need this book. Nevertheless I give it two stars, because of the part which deals with the psychological aspects."
3,Healthy Tips,"I picked up this book because I read a number of good reviews here and was intrigued. There are some good tips here undeniably but I was bored reading this book. Many of these things I've heard or read before. One of the bigger turn offs for me was her ""candor"" about her obsessiveness whether with food or exercise. I'm sorry I couldn't really get into this book."
5,Love this book,Loved this book...very informative and inspiring regarding health and wellness. You are not overwhelmed with the information but better prepared to make good changes in your life. Highly recommend
4,aiat is really nice!,I really liked that watch...its perfect when you wear it in the party or somewhere in the official occasion.
4,cool,Very cold!!!use in the summer when it is hot to cool u downholds lots of water yet is light weight
4,Happy to find.,"In past years lesser works by great authors were difficult to find. If you could find them chances are they were old books at exorbitant prices.I am extremely pleased with this book in that it presents a little known work, newly printed (outstanding print and paper) and at a reasonable cost. I must admit that I am biased, Conrad is my favorite author, and having said that I can also say that this is not his best work. But I havenever read any of his stories without appreciation and enjoyment. I was happy to find this book and add it to my collection. KLM"

5,"A charming lesson on ""looking through the eyes of love.""","This is a charming story of a child lost and reunited with her peasant parents. When I was a children's librarian I used to read this to my first graders who all thought that their own mothers were beautiful. Now that I teach in high school I use it as an comparison for a Japanese story by Kawabata. It is the perfect explanation of ""looking through the eyes of love."""
5,Top 10 Crime Book of the 21st Century,"I must say that in all the recent books about gangsters and their molls from the 1930s, this book is one of the best ever, period! Full of new information on the Dillinger gang and Ma Barker and her brood of killers. Also, many photographs, which have never before been published. If you don't purchase this one, you are missing out on an important part of researching any gangster from this time period, which will include the woman who ran with these bandits."
5,Seeking Knowledge?,"The small details when compiled by Mr Missler produce powerful revelations and ultimate truths that will make you shout for joy, say a prayer or ask for mercy. This gem of bible treasures will convict your heart leave you in amazement and awe of how great God truly is and how much he LOVES ALL of us.... ""Hidden Treasures"" a little book with a big message has reinforced my faith and encourages me to continue to seek the real treasure Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.... ""Hidden Treasures"" a treasure found worth more than silver and gold! Deuteronomy 4:35"
4,"I wanted headphones, and that's what I got.","I got a Samsung Gleam (SCH-700) a little while ago, and felt that I was missing out by not being able to listen to music on it, so I picked up a memory card, and then started looking for headphones. These were the cheapest I could find, but they work (although, at least with my phone, the plug has to be in the right range of positions for the left ear bud to have sound), and they're pretty comfortable, as far as earbud headphones go. I have yet to (and probably won't ever) take a call while wearing them, so I can't say much of the headset's full capabilities, but if you just want something so you can listen to music on your phone, this headset should work just fine."
1,one side doesn't work,"One of the ear buds doesn't work unless you pull the thing that plugs into the port out a little bit but if you touch it at all, it stops working again. Its very annoying. sure they were cheap but if only half of it works then its not worth it. I would have rater used the money i wasted on half a pair of earphones to buy a more expensive pair that actually works all the way. I read the reviews and other people have had this problem too. I figured theirs were just defective or something and i bought it anyway, but no. Mine don't work either. Plus, the wire is really really long for one ear bud and really really short for the other. It makes it extra difficult to listen to music on top of on side only working when the jack is exactly in the right position, the earbud with the short side is always getting pulled out of my ear cause all of the extra wire constantly gets caught on things.Don't waste your money"
5,Horizon Season 1,"This product was sent to me in a very good condition and I'm glad I bought it. The series is a confusing one but once you understand it, the plot becomes amazing. I would say watch the anime online first and if you're in love with it, buy it because it'll be worth it."
5,have read it a million times!!!,"louis lamour is easily my favoritest author - and this is my favoritest book of his.superlative action, adventure swashbuckler.the story of an irish prince who becomes a fugitive, becomes the greatest swordsman of his time and wins back what is his by right.action, adventure, romance, a little bit of history, mystery, drama, sentiment, earthy philosophy - this book has it all!pity that lamour never got to writing a sequel to it - though apparently he did desire to do one."
3,Book review,I got this book thinking it was another one. It's one of his best ones and I've read just 1 or 2 short of all of them.
2,I liked it but it it failed in 3 months,I did what I wanted and worked well from July to October but now the lcd is failing and it won't connect to the remote.Yes I did replace the batteries but no difference.So now I look for something that does the same thing but is better built to last at least 2 years.I would have given it 4 stars if it lasted longer than one set of batteries.
2,Not working,The meter ran for about a week with fresh bats and quit. Would like a repacement and might give it 5 stars if it works.JD
1,"outdoors sensor isn't for outdoors,. also weak range","I have had this a week and it is useless. The range was about 25' through a wall, and didnt read the outdoor meter. That makes it close to useless.It rained for the first time yesterday, and the outdoor sensor got wet and it is now completely useless.What's the point of an outdoor sensor that cant take rain? If I wanted to walk out and look at a thermometer, I wouldn't need a wireless one.There are a lot of ""should be great"" pool toys/lights/thermometers that are poorly made, this is the next in that list. I have looked at the comparable items, and there are none under $200 that will work. I should have regarded more of the negative reviews on this one before buying."
1,Do not buy!!,"I bought one of these units to monitor the temps in my solar greenhouse. Worked great until the batteries in the remote died. I replaced ALL the batteries with brand new Duracell's but the weather station can not ""find"" or will not communicate with the remote after the battery failure. After dancing around with LaCrosse they refused to do anything other than blame the batteries.I will NEVER purchase another LaCrosse weather station!DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!!"
1,Another remote sensor problem,"I wondered how come the lake temperature in Northern Wisconsin was still shown to be over 50 degf. When I took the sensor in for the winter, I found out. The remote sensor reads 11 degf high. I then went to see if Amazon would honor a return policy....nope, right to return expired earlier this summer. LaCrosse techs say merely to replace batteries. Already done that, and it still has 11 degf error.This is a great concept for a great price. Let me know if anybody gets one to operate with any degree of accuracy."
2,External probe does not work,"It's a nice little unit. The range is better than most I've tried, but not nearly what they claim. Unfortunately, the external probe that plugs into the remote unit does not do anything; it is ignored. I have already thrown out the packaging; don't make my mistake!"
3,its not the greatest,Well at first I loved the stroller...it is light weight and easy to fold it and put it to ur trunk...Well then as i used couple times couple reasons that made me question1. it doestnt recline all the way so when my son is sleeping he is sliding down.2. he is sliding down while he is sitting.3. sun cover wont stay in its place.4. cup holder keep poping out.
3,Love the ease of this stroller,I have researched every stroller on earth and decided on this one for my third daughter. After having it for 4 months and using it regularly the foot rest started to crack in half. I live in cold climate 1/2 the year and dont know if thats part of the problem. Anyhow Graco didnt have it to replace so they refunded me in full.Problem aside its still a great stroller.
3,"Love the product, but not the pattern.","I love this car seat, and the matching stroller, but the pattern on the fabric is not quite what it looks like on here. The fabric looks quite a bit more stylish in the picture than it really is. The dark color is a really bright purple, and not quite what I was looking for."
2,Great music for only 10 darn tracks!!,"Typical of Collectables to reissue their version of the deleted ""Rock Artifacts: Sugar & Spice, A Collection"" on Columbia, which had 18 tracks. This crummy Collectables collection has only 10.It's their way of saving some dough on royalities and mechanical liscensing.The band was one of Chicago's best groups of the mid-1960's. Seek out the not-too-difficult-to-locate deleted Columbia collection, instead."
3,"Great show, shame about the video","This was a great show - all thirteen wonderful episodes - and if you are looking for old appearances of Anthony Stewart Head or Michael Easton then this is well worth the money.But if you're a fan of the show, like I am, you'll be more than a little aggrieved to learn that this tape, Vol. 4, contains the episode 'Escape.' As does Vol. 3. For some reason known only to themselves the company producing these videos, Rhino, have decided not to release episode '5D' on a tape and instead have issued 'Escape' twice, on two different tapes. With the price I have to pay to ship this over to the UK you can guess I'm not a happy bunny. This on top of the fact that Rhino have mysteriously edited out the original soundtrack and replaced it with tinny muzack of their own choosing. All in all, not great value for money."
3,Pricey to add shelves,I love my closet system. I was just a bit taken back by the cost of 2 shelves. Could have used 3 but was unwilling to pay for 4.
3,Not a bad book.,"This book is set around Valentine's Day, and a big party that a neighbour of Annie and Max is holding. At the end of the party the hostess is found dead. There aren't many suspects for this murder in this exclusive gated community, but Annie and Max set out to find out who dunnit with the help of Max's spacey mother. I enjoyed this book a bit more than some of the previous ones since it didn't seem as silly and the murder and the clues were pretty good. But I can't tolerate Laurel much longer. She's too typecast for me, and that is why I gave this book a three instead of a four. Anyway, the war between the two cats, and Annie's paintings that are explained at the beginning of the book made this a fun book to read."
3,"India's Past, re-visited.","As I have remarked previously, the whole Merchant of Ivory series, is interesting as education but slow and lacking in the entertainment dept."
4,An author to watch!,"This book is as charming and irresistible as its hero, Robin Goodfellow. I admit that I'm most familiar with Robin as Puck as portrayed in Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream."" This book takes him way beyond that.Kate, the heroine, is a real keeper too. The plot went farther afield than I expected (in fact, ""beyond the fields we know"") but was satisfying. I could quibble over a few minor items, but that would just be nitpicking.Thanks to this book, Karen Fox is now one of my authors to watch."
5,Best Bones,"This book is the most comprehensive and helpful that I have read on the subject of osteoporosis. By following many of the suggestions, especially for diet, my bone density has been slowly but surely improving, and the last scan shows that I'm moving back into the osteopenia area of the chart!! Hurrah!"
2,"Ross' Attempt to Duplicate Streisand's ""Guilty"" Fails","Miserable RCA 1980's collection with the Brothers Gibb trying to do for Diana Ross what they did for Barbra Streisand. The songs are boring nondescript dated material, with the exception of the quirky and nostalgiac ""Chain Reaction."" The title track is notable because it pairs Ross with Michael Jackson."
4,Outings made easier,This product made it much easier to walk our two dogs at the same time. We have a beagle and a dachshund. It is adjustable and has a soft grip handle. The only complaint is that it should be a little longer of a leash.
2,Had problems with larger strong dogs,"I used the sporn for 2 large huskies; I found that when one dog pulled, the other suddenly had a much shorter lead. In other words, the locking mechanism to keep the lengths of each lead as I set it didn't lock well enough to keep the leads from changing lengths when one dog pulled and the other didn't. Possibly it was defective but I came up with a new solution so just returned the sporn rather than exchange it to try again."
4,Soothing and uplifting,Beautiful and inspirational songs. My kids got it for their Granddad for Christmas; he really enjoys it. Very soothing and uplifting.
3,Not too sure,"Hard to tell if really affective. But, I think it does the job as intended...no negative side effects. So, therefore, I am neutral on the product but had no negative effects from it."
3,Disappointing,"Two major objections: (1) product doesn't ""breathe""--wrist gets sweaty and itchy; (2)velcro straps are cumbersome and bulky.There should be an illustration of the back of the hand side showing the 3 straps."
2,Continuous play cd (arrrggghhh),"I really bought this cd for track (#13 on mine but different on the site), anyway for ""Back Together"" Hardsoul featuring my acquaintance the talented Ron Carroll of Defected Chicago also a DJ with a profound voice... I was so displeased to realize this cd is a continuous mix-which I hate. Not only that, for instance, the Ron Carroll track isn't even a full 2.5 minutes so... If you're looking for a full song on this cd, you won't get it.This is more Techno than House."
1,"A book written by a bitter ,disgruntled man","I spent eight years at First Baptist preparing for the ministry. I am now Pastoring a growing church in Pa. I left Hammond in 1992. I just have one question for anyone reading this comment: Will you take the word of this former member who got his feelings hurt and got with the critics , or would you check with one of the 1000's of members who attend regurally? I suggest you take the word of 1000's that are serving God faithfully rather than choosing to listen to a few critics who are doing nothing for God! But then it is always easier to believe a lie."
3,Quick Read - Offers some valuable information,"My daughter will be 22 months when #2 comes along. I am pretty anxious about the closeness in age, so I really wanted to start early and try and be as informed as I could about my situation. I read the whole book right when I got it. It had some good points and gave some real life situations, but I thought everything was touched on briefly and left some questions unanswered. I would still recommend it, because it did bring up situations I did not even consider.I gave it the 3 stars because I think it is a little on the ... side. There was 112 pages of rather large print and a price tag of .... You can read this book in an hour. The good thing is that I think I can actually get my husband, who hates to read, to read this one, because it is so brief. I too have become a ""Twice Blessed"" fan. It is much more informative."
2,Unimpressive,"This book had some good points, and it's an easy read. But it doesn't have a whole lot of information, and it wasn't inspiring. ""Twice Blessed"" is significantly better. Two Fast is not worth the $15."
1,Climax of Season Three Slump (Part II),"This is one of the lowest spots of TOS. The Way to Eden was the ""Jumping the Shark"" moment for Star Trek. Even though the rest of Season Three would be excellent, the Season Three slump probably convinced the executives to pull the plug on Star Trek. Question of the day: If a blade of grass or a flower is too hot to handle, wouldn't it have been too hot for Adam and Dr. Sevrin to hold a piece of fruit? Very dumb. Also, how did Dr. Sevrin climb up an acid tree? Avoid this episode."
2,This episode gets a C- grade and is ranked 66th out of 80,"Chasing the stolen vessel Aurora, the U.S.S. Enterprise rescues the thieves just before the Aurora is destroyed. The group is led by Dr. Sevrin in a search for a mythological planet named Eden, a planet reputed to be a paradise. Since one of Sevrin's group is the son of a Federation ambassador, Sevrin is held in protective custody while his followers are permitted to be free aboard ship. But when Spock is able to deduce Eden's location, Sevrin's followers free Sevrin and take over the starship. Reaching Eden, Sevrin takes his people down to the surface in a shuttlecraft. When Kirk leads a landing party in pursuit, they find that the planet's vegetation all secretes deadly acid, and the fruits are all poisonous. Madly refusing to believe Kirk, Sevrin bites a piece of fruit and dies immediately. With his death, his followers are taken back aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise."
5,Great Detail!,What a great little book. I bought it for my daughter who is 6. She has had so much fun with the charachters and the detail of the school. This was a great Christmas present!
2,Poor paper quality,"The stiff, easily broken paper won't lie flat or hold intended positions. The book is always misshapen when opened and problems can't be corrected. Ribbons are very weak and don't close the covers when tied."
5,THE REALLY SOUL OF BUENOS AIRES,"I'M SORRY BUT I CANT WRITE ABBOUT TANGO WITHOUT SPEAKING SPANISH. CONSIDERO QUE ADRIANA VARELA, ES UNA EXCELENTE DISCIPULA DEL POLACO GOYENECHE, UN ENFASIS MUY ESPECIAL EN EL TIMBRE DE SU VOZ, SU CAPACIDAD DE VOCALIZACION. CONSIDERO QUE LOGRO CAPTAR EN SU ESCENCIA INTIMA LO QUE CADICAMO QUISO EXPRESAR CON UN TOQUE MUY PROFUNDO DE GOYENECHE. PLEASE, EDIT THIS CD AGAIN, I THINK NO PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD WHO LOVES TANGO CAN MISS THIS WORK GUILLERMO J. MARTINEZ MD."
5,Incredible expression of Bristol's underground,"The CD is incredible. It's a continuous mix of brilliantly assembled sounds from the Bristol Underground. If you're a fan of Massive Attack or Tricky, you'll have to move something out of your CD rack to put your Smith and Mighty CD. It's a must"
3,all beats,not what I expected - its all beats and zero melody. singing voices are mixed way down into the back of the mix. Its a long CD so if you like this type of music you'll have lots of it to listion to.
4,LIVELY LECTURES,"In a complex and engaging study of William James, Newman, von Hugel and Buber, Nicholas Lash makes the case for the experience of God not being something totally a matter of mystical feelings restricted to a few.Indeed, the experience of God is to be found in ordinary life. The closing chapters on difference, mystery and experience as well as observations on the pattern of Christian teaching are challenging and uncommon. Reflections that are worth a peek."
2,Cheap imitation of a cool tool,"This is such a cheap imitation of a great toy. Unfortunately after one pop the gun broke. The wood is cheap and thin, the cork disintegrated after the first shot, and the string popped out. Luckily the price wasn't too bad. However, considering it was a ""one shot deal"" it was costly.Definitely not worth the money."
3,Cheep but effective,"I bought 2 of these, for my 3 year old son and 7 year old step daughter. They love to ""hunt"" and ""spy"" and all that fun stuff. I played with both of them after taking them out of the box last night and they will be okay. Much smaller than I had anticipated."
3,Historical quirk.,"This Nightline is useful for, if anything, its capturing a snapshot in time of a doomed political movement, ""Intelligent Design."" Its most remarkable feature was a ""debate"" of sorts, ostensibly on a scientific topic, by two conservative journalists--Cal Thomas and George Will. The back-and-forth is too short, too unstructured, and too short of expertise in relevant fields to be of any pedegogical importance, but Will's presence in itself demonstrates that one need not be a liberal to accept and advance good science. There was a time when I admired Thomas for a principled stand he took on censorship, but that was many years ago, and since then I think he's gone increasingly off the rails in his efforts to promote a religious right ideology that eclipses reason and good sense."
1,Childish and pathetic,"I was prepared to love this book - the premise sounded extremely promising. However, the more I got into it, the more disgusted I became. The writing is extremely childish. Lily's character was PATHETIC - literally BEGGING Whitby for crumbs of affection. Have some self-respect, girl! Grow a damn backbone! It was disgusting. And Whitby's falling in love with her by the end was not convincing. Seemed like she browbeated him into loving her until he was too tired so he just gave in. UGH."
5,A women after her man,This was a really good novel. The plot was interesting and it kept you interested in what was going to happen next. Lily was adorabel in the way she when about getting Whitby. I recommand this book. It's will make you cry and laught at the same time. Ms.Julianne MacLean really caught the essenes of Lily.
2,I would pass - save your money,This was very sweet love story of a man who was rake and feel in love with Lily after they were married. Lily had loved Whitby aka the rake all her life and was willing to marry without love. This book took me three days to read and was very sad slow book. I would suggest instead One Little Sin by Liz Carlyle or The Lady Lies by Samantha Saxon.
5,An Excellent Overview,"This is a great way to understand what is behind this great epic story. Charles Kovacs brings it up to date, placing it in context with today's events and helping the reader to appreciate its relevance for the modern human condition. If you are teaching it or if you just want to understand it yourself, I highly recommend this version."
3,Only part of the film!,"This version of Heidi was my absolute favorite movie as a child. I have the VHS version and decided to upgrade to the DVD. I couldn't believe it when I started watching it that the first part of the film is not even included. We don't see how Heidi got to her grandfathers, met Peter or his grandmother. I don't know if it is somehow a mistake on just my movie or if they are all missing the first scenes. The quality of the rest of the film was fine and just as good as I remembered. But, if you want to see the whole film, get the VHS."
1,Canadian money??,I went to open this box and found that I had received the Canadian version of this game...with Canadian money. Nothing on the site says or shows that this will have Canadian money....I will seek to get the American money version as I am most upset about this. I sure hope I won't have to pay to return the product so that I can get the correct version!!
4,Money Bags Game,This is the second one I have bought from Amazon. It is a great educational board game for learning how to count change. Thanks.
3,Great for young kids,I have a 7 year old. He has learned to count change and now he pays the tabs when we go shopping... With my money of course.
1,Awful!,"Simply put, this is an awful film. It is billed as a comedy, but there is nothing, at all, funny about it. More than a financial burden it's also a waste of time. John Cleese, himself, was unable to save this picture, that is how bad it is. What is unfunny about it? Everything. I don't know who the planned audience for this disaster was supposed to be, but I can't think of any part of the world population who would think this film was even mildly amusing. The more serious storyline, if you can even call it that, makes very little sense and doesn't bring the notability or the value of this project up either. For a better relatively unknown John Cleese film check outClockwise."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I ordered this ""DVD"" because it said:4 hours of instructional video on DVD. But, what I received for my $10 was a instructional VHS that was only 30 minutes in length."
4,Oh My...,Unbelievably original concept. I really enjoyed this book. I'm not going to go into the plot since so many has already written about it. It's very original and gives both sides of the smoking debate. There are a lot of twists in it that you don't see coming and you fall in and out of love with the lead characters. Mr. Mills leaves you hanging in a lot of instances for chapters while you are trying to figure out what is happening and why. It's extremely well written and I highly recommend it. I will be reading more of Mr. Mills' books.
1,Where's The Big Hit???,"I was going to purchase this CD until I found out ""Try Again"" was not included. Why release a Best Of package on an artist and not include their biggest, most well-known hit? What a waste of time. ""How Bout Us"" was a moderate hit for the group. The rest of the track listing are relative unknown songs. Maybe someone will release a more befitting package on the group in the future."
4,"Great photography & variety, not all practical.","This book consists of pictures of wood designs categorized by type of work. Each design is a combination of craftsmanship and artistic creativity. The photo reproduction is excellent. The level of woodworking skill is incredible. I'm just an amateur, and many of the works used amazing techniques that I wouldn't even think about trying.I was looking for project ideas and the variety in the book far exceeds my tastes. Less than 20% of the designs actually interested me, though many had ideas that I could learn from. The book doesn't include shop drawings or build instructions. It does, however, reinforce my determination to continue working wood."
3,Intriguing storyline,"Mr. Wimpfen obviously shared from his storehouse of worldwide experiences when he wrote this story. I felt I learned a great deal about parts of the world I have only visited peripherally. For example, I have been to Manila several times, but have yet to step foot in the jungle. He took me there.I found his thesis thought-provoking. When it came to implementing his formula for saving the world from itself, I wondered if I would have willingly been a participant. It sure made me think."
5,A Masterpiece,"This is as good as it gets, folks. It's easy to understand, as you listen to this complex stunner, why Elvis Costello is one of the most treasured songwriters of his generation. Elvis plays to his strengths on this masterful release: tight song structures and a feeling of impending emotional erruption. A mindblower!"

5,Excellent book!,"I've read this book more than once and have bought it for friends. Kenneth Hagin goes through the Bible and what it says about the subject. Not man's religious opinions or verses taken out of context. I'd especially recommend it for divorced Christians who are feeling condemned, particularly when the divorce wasn't what they wanted."
5,Failing Schools or Failing Law?,"James Popham's book ""America's 'Failing' Schools: How Parents and Teachers Can Cope With No Child Left Behind"" is an up front and simply written piece that argues why the No Child Left Behind Act is actually hurting our students and schools instead of helping them. Popham explains how school report cards are not an accurate portrayal of a school's credibility, just as standardized tests are not a fair judgment of a student's abilities. He goes on to challenge both parents and teachers alike to speak up against this unfair assessment and demand better tests and more indicators to determine the educational health of our nation's students and schools. Popham's book clarified all questions I had regarding the No Child Left Behind Act as well as broadened my outlook on the negative effects standardized testing has on our country. Although his book contains some bias, he supports his claims and (as a teacher himself) has the credibility to speak his mind."
1,Not Recommended,"There is a reason some movies go straight to DVD and this a perfect example of one. I like Larry Bishop, but he should have shelved this project. Save your time and $$."
1,pure rubbish,"I walked around blockbuster one day and happen to run into hellride thinking it could be a fun movie being that i'm a big 70's exploitation buff. I put it in my player and i gave it a chance hoping it'd be fun. Boy was i wrong, the moment i saw larry bishop in that ridiculous clothing and animated as hell persona i knew i was in for unadulterated nonsense and drivel. it's a disgrace to cinema, and dennis hopper was so wasted in this film, as the typical druggie looking for a purpose, shame on you dennis. not even the sexy babes in the film piqued my interest. it's a huge snoozefest that makes absolutely no sense. This film felt rushed. It only has the tarantino credit on the box to keep the grindhouse fans happy. Not recommended."

1,Tarantino Wannabe,"I was really looking forward to this movie from the trailer i saw earlier in the year and the cool cast. However this film has a nonsensical plot, wooden acting and is flat out boring. The writer/director/star of this self indulgent tripe (Larry Bishop) seems to think that simply putting nudity, drugs, violence and bikes into a movie will make it cool and worth watching. Wrong. This is nothing more than a vanity piece from a man who loves nothing more than trying to look and act tough whilst getting to feel up as many skanky women as he can. I love many B movies but this is try hard and not worth your time and money."
1,Worst 'Biker' Flick EVER! ! ! !,"I caught this POS on Dish the other night, and don't know which was the stronger urge, trying to stay awake, or not changing the channel. I have lived the Life for over 40 years, and, to an 'Old School' Outlaw, this is the lowest form of satirical comedy bordering on insult. I can't believe it was actually written & produced by anyone who had ever had anything to do with this 'genre', even the 'B' class U/A flicks from the '60's'. It views like some high school kid's fantasy wet dream.If you MUST watch this piece of drivel, do like I did and catch it on Dish or cable (IF you can sit thru it!) and save your bucks for gas money. . . . .The actors, especially Hopper & Carradine, must either have been bored out of their minds or had some serious debts to pay off to get involved in this stinkeroo!"
2,A good machine...when it works,"I am a complete beginner and have had lots of fun with my machine and am totally hooked on sewing. However, in the 3 months I have had it it has been sent away twice with alignment and various other problems with the bobbin case and motor. I am really disappointed. One person who looked at it thought that I had been sewing fabrics that were took thick; I have been making bags that have two layers of fabric and a layer of interfacing, but even given the price, I feel that the machine is not value for money if it cannot cope with this. Overall, when it works it is a great machine - maybe I have been really unlucky - but I am not sure I would buy it again."
4,Brother ES2000 sewing machine,"Great price,easy to use, the speed control pedal takes some getting use to though. All things considered a good all around machine."
3,I really do love this machine,"But...I sew ALOT. I get very frustrated when a needle bends or breaks. And I seem to be going through alot of needles. I keep my machines clean and oiled. This one seems to be for light things and for pretty things. But if you are going to do a good bit of heavy sewing I do not recommend this machine. But for light sewing, use of the embroidery stitches(the best feature for the price)or occasional mending I love it."
5,Great sewing machine for the price,I just purchased this machine for the little girl I teach sewing to and am jealous of how many features it offers and how nice it sews. I've recommended it to 7 of my friends and family and all love how well it handles thin and thick fabrics alike. This is really a great machine.
3,Brother 77 Atitch Sewing Machine,Does not do basic stitching well. Not so easy to setup for novices. Recommended for those with higher skill sewing experiences. Still an amazing machine.
4,great historica fiction,"My daughter read Sound the Jubilee (this book is the sequel to Jubilee) for required summer reading. She enjoyed that book so much, we ordered this one. She did not devour it as quickly, but still enjoyed it. Living in the South, I like for her to read books where she learns more of our illustrious (or not so illustrious)heritage."
4,Very Cool!,"After a few listens I couldn't put my finger on why this sound is familiar. After reading the credits I realized why. Most of the tracks were written and produced by Jeff Kabot, lead singer and writer from the Superkools. ""Booze Cruizin"" actually sounds like Kabot. I have a Superkools version of this song off Trigon Records ""Auto Body Experience"" and it's different. It's cool a record, like the SK's with a Voxx. Early Miracle Workers and Pandoras. Nice to hear a fresh take on Garage Punk!"
2,Lame... very lame,"This book sucks. It makes the basic principles of marketing more confusing by bombarding the reader with various terms and phrases with an excessive amount of overlap between them. There is no clear-cut distinction between the glossary items, making studying for bi-weekly exams a chore."
3,"""okay"" reeds","These are usually the recommended ""step-up"" reeds for woodwind players. The quality of these reeds are mediocre at best--there are maybe 2 good reeds out of a whole box, even after you adjust them through filing and sanding. When you get a good reed from the box, it can produce a great, warm tone, but it's a rare event. When I first used them I thought they were the greatest things on the planet...until I tried other reeds. Vandoren reeds are okay, maybe as a substitute until you can order your favorites. As a step-up, Rico La Voz are better. I'd also recommend Rico Grand Concert or Reserve, as well as Gonzales."
3,my review-gregg's party,"I thought the video gave an opinion of a parnet who thought they were doing the right thing for their son and his friends sake. That they could have fun at home, but not behind the wheel. I viewed this with an open mind, but could not help that I personally would never let my child partied/drink as much as these kids did at one night after the prom, someone could have died or passed out from alcohol poisioning.everyone has their own opionion. I wished they could have shown some stats of drinking and driving in some states, and the severe consequences they would face."
5,Great Tumbling Mat,"We bought this to be able to practice Jujutsu.It is great.Just be sure to order the velcro on all 4 sides, we just got it on the ends, now that we want to buy another mat to put them side by side, we would like to have the velcro on the sides."
3,no very good for an adult,"This is an ok product for kids, the space for your legs is too small to be ok for an adult for any long time in the pool. I would not buy again even though it is 30% cheaper then the better product"
3,"Good Suspense, a bit weak overall","This was my introduction to Ferrigno's books, and I expect that his later efforts will get better. He dragged out a minimal mystery with a lot of good characterization. He was able to sustain the suspense - not of whodunnit, but rather of whydunnit. I read through it quickly, which means it was written well enough to sustain my interest."
5,Great Game,"I have just got to write this as a rebuttal to the previous review..This game is fantastic. I don't know what kind of system the previous reviewer is running, but this game works flawlessly on mine. As far as ""falling asleep during the game because the missions are too long to reach the target"" there is an option in the settings to ""start game near target."" It really helps to read, not just jump in and start banging away! The targets will blow up if you HIT them. No crazy ""third person camera"" problems here.It just drives me crazy when people bash perfectly good games just because they either don't have a decent machine to run it or they just plain don't know how to set it up!It's a great game, folks.The aircraft are beautifully modelled..Way better than I had expected."
4,Good realism,"I purchased this game because my late father actually flew Phantoms in Vietnam and participated in the Rolling Thunder campaign, and I wanted to ""share"" in his experiences. He also flew the F-100 for many years prior to the Vietnam conflict. The game runs great, and is pretty realistic. I would recommend it to any Vietnam-era combat enthusiasts."
4,Great Book!,"I have been using this book for many years and I must say that it is the best book about colonial silver coins there is. This book, the Krause book, and Sedwicks book together make a pretty complete library about cobs.Yes there are problems with the book, but there is honestly no better book on the market. This book has great information on all the mints, the most extensive collection of pictures of nearly every type of coin from all the mints and very good desrciptions of everything."
3,A little off the beaten path...,"This flick scared the fecal matter outta me as a thirteen year-old babysitter late one night back in the seventies. Haven't seen it since but would jump at the chance... The 3-star rating is just a guess and may be overly rosy as I couldn't tell bad acting from good at that age, of course."
2,I prefer the newer one,The movie itself was fine quality but the actual movie was kind of lacking. I perfer the newer one from early 2000s. I cant understand why this became a cult classic.
3,guess this is the best we get?,"Wow, what is going through the minds at IMAGE? This may have passed for a DVD, but for a Blu-ray this looks terrible. The picture is so soft i thought my contacts were dirty from how blurred the picture is. There is no vibrant color or anything to distinguish this from a pristine VHS. I cannot speak for previous versions of this movie, but it is clear that no remastering was done beyond the original dvd mastering/clean-up. This does not in any way - nor does it even say remastered in HD. Just ported to 1080p.Edit: I went and read some on this and i guess this is about the best they will do for it. So i guess. Either way a soft and fuzzy picture on your 1080p HD TV, cleaned yes, but a soft picture."
3,Vinyl Version Superior to CD,"The vinyl edition of ""Fresh Aire IV"" sounds far better than the CD. I noticed this upon hearing the CD on it's initial release. Several times over the years I pointed this out to the people at American Gramaphone Records via their website but they always disputed any difference, saying the CD and vinyl sound the same. I found the vinyl album at a used record store and play that now instead of the CD. Oddly, the label issued an edited version of ""G Major Toccata"" that sounds exactly like the vinyl version on a CD sampler."
1,Great perfume; terrible packaging; rude vendor,"I ordered this for my Mom (she loves Safari and I can't find it in stores anymore). When it arrived, it was a tiny amount of perfume in a much larger bottle (I know, it's perfume and more concentrated, but the size of the bottle seemed misleading). I literally struggled for half-an-hour to remove the stopper from the bottle. My mom is in her 80's, and I knew she would not be able to handle it. When I called the vendor (Beauty Encounter) they were very rude, denied there was a problem and said if I wanted to return it I would have to pay for it. (Plus I had to pay for the LD phone call... apparently they have an 800# but don't print it on the packing slip). I ended up ordering the Safari eau de parfum spray from [...] (much better experience), and keeping the perfume with the stopper myself. A $66 mistake!"
1,Useless,A real pain to get the phone into and out of and very hard to use the keyboard while attached - sent it back. Still haven't found a good case for the XV6700.
4,Pop music,Aman ali khan and ayaan ali khan are known for very innovative and great music creations.This album is one more proof to the statement.
3,Good for school,Very good! For students of all ages. Sized right for bookbags. Some schools don't allow phone use so books are handy.
3,Music Duplication,The music of The FreshAire is really good! However FreshAire II Fall has only 2 or 3 songs that are not on the two disk set from the original studio production.
4,Great add-on for George Foreman G5 grills,I made omelets with this and they turned out great. My kids asked for seconds and said they were the best omelets ever. Also makes great pancakes!
4,Not big enough scooped out area,"Very nice. I have used the plates a couple of times now. Once for omelets and once for the stuffed french toast that came in the small recipe book. It may have worked better with two scooped out areas instead of three, making each bigger. The scooped out does not hold enough for two egg omelet with any kind of ingredient such as ham. Same was true for the french toast."
4,ease of use,"I have a terrible time trying cook a decent looking omelet in a conventionalskillet (no talent). The the George Foreman Omelet Plates do a good job of omelet cooking, and they look nice.It tends to run a little hot at their reccomended settings."
2,Good rain gauge for one year,The rain gauge worked well for a year and a half. Batteries lasted one year and are nearly impossible to replace without breaking the cover. Once the cover is broken water gets inside and you are done. On the other hand it's cheap so if you don't mind buying and installing one each year or two this is your rain gauge!
1,Don't waste your money,"The design of the outdoor unit is poor because the battery compartment cover doesn't seat well and allows moisture in. It worked for about 6 months and quit completely. New batteries didn't help. Also, the order you have to put them in to establish communications between the units is a pain. Spend more money and get a good one or spend less and get the simple tube type with no batteries."
3,Problems in Setting up Rain Gauage,"I could not get my rain gauge to work with the instructions, so I returned it. I ordered another one and I had the same problem. I called a technician and he said that the complete instructions never got from China, thru Germany to US translated correctly, so he had to email me the complete set of directions.My neighbor bought one and is having the same problem. I want to help her get hers working, but unfortunately, I deleted the instructions so would you please email the complete instructions so I may help her."
1,Worked... only for 6 months...,"This ""Wireless"" rain guage is worthless. Item worked for a minimum of 6 months. Continues to loose signal and even with fresh batteries, needs to be reset every two weeks. It has eaten through a mess of batteries and is totally not worth the cost or effort to keep it running. I am looking for a stable replacement. Sad, it looks quality made, but function is non existent. Buy at your own risk. LaCrosse is off my list."
