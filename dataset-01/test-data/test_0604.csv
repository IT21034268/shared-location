3,"If it wasn't for ""Overcome""...","I'll keep this short, this album is what one would expect from the ""Bon Jovi of alternative rock"" straight forward, nothing mind blowing or unexpected. V is however a solid effort from beginning to end, the exception being the creepy Overcome wich has taken on a life of it's own with the demolishing of the World trade Center towers."
2,Not the same Live,"If your a real Live fan who loves them for what they've got to say, don't buy this CD. They get lost in repeated choruses that don't really get anywhere and the music is too edgy to enjoy. If you don't own Mental Jewelry, definitely pick that up instead."
2,Disappointed,"The reviewer put it best in his depicting eastern references as ""slapped on"". What made the band ""Live"" was its lyrical content and strong driving force (Jimmy Buffet with your Dad?-Transmit your Love). Perhaps too many ""holidays"" in the east have been taken and too little time in thinking and expressing the feelings of youthful angst. I fear that a band I love has diluted itself over the years and that it has proven itself to be very much like U2."
1,Really poor effort,"I can't tell you I was thoroughly disappointed I was hearing this album. Live is one of those bands that I will buy anything they make, even without listening to it. I won't even bother pointing to specific songs because they all sound contrived and flimsy. It is my hope that they will shake out of their rut, and come back with another triumph. I am sure they will."
1,horrible,i hate live i hate live i hate live this is HORRIBLE music i hate live i hate live i hate live i hate live
2,Disappointing,"I've listened to this album a few times now. I keep waiting for it to grow on me. It doesn't. Many of the songs are mediocre, if not outright bad. ""Simple Creed"" has some of the elements of their earlier efforts and will probably be the biggest (and only) single. The lyrics of many of the songs are quite laughable. ""Deep Enough"" makes me laugh/cringe each time I hear it. Even ""Simple Creed"" sounds silly at times, just listen to the line, ""born with your back to the god/that picked you up by your puppy scruff"". I have to agree with the editorial review. The whole feels devoid of emotion. Their recent live performance here also lacked the passion of earlier shows. Perhaps Ed should continue with his acting career (he did a cameo as a waiter in Fight Club) and hang up his guitar."
3,Its no Throwing Copper,"Live seem to have developed a sine curve of a career, alternating between brilliant albums and mediocre ones. The two high-points of Throwing Copper and Distance to Here have always been offset with more difficult and experimental albums, the most obvious being Secret Samadhi, which never quite took off.V unfortunately finds itself in the trough of the curve, with Live building on their powerful riffs but pushing them into more nu-metal influenced areas. But the good news is that this trough is not as deep as Samadhi was, and once you get past some of Ed's weaker lyrical moments (""In the West, we think we're the best""??), and indeed, Ed's rapping, you get an album that still manages to be uplifting and energising."
5,Middle school Latin,"I am developing a 5th and 6th grade Latin program at my middle school, and I have been delighted with the Minimus books. The kids really seem to like them, and I appreciate the bright colors and easy to follow story line. I am supplementing with more of a traditional paradigm approach to learning the grammar, but the books provide a great launching point for discussion and reading that is much more fun than just sitting around memorizing verb endings. Some of the material is very British, so I have to explain some of the references to my kids, but other than that it is a wonderful curriculum."
4,Fantastic Jack,"After using a standard floor jack for transmission work and having more problems than I could ever think about, I decided to try the tool that was made for the job. The Torin jack filled the bill completely. Although the cradle is more suited to automatics, I devised a cradle out of wood that would fit the standard. I used ratchet straps to secure it rather than the chains that came with the jack, just couldn't figure out how they could possibly work. The only con was that the tilt adjustment was very dificult to use -- it needed more leverage than the small plastic knob could provide. That was solved by using a socket wrench on the other end of the shaft. Like most things made off shore, all the fasteners are metric. This jack just made the job 100% easier. Would hartily reccomend this tool to anyone doing transmission work. Would have been 5 stars had the tilt adjustment been easier to use."
4,Very detailed and beyond pure usability by the user,"The book is very detailed packed with information. What I liked the most about it was the fact that conflicts between pure usability for the visitor and search engine friendly site architecture (search engine optimization or SEO) were addressed by the book as well. It did not just point out those conflicts but offered suggestions for possible compromises between the two.I think that this book is especially helpful for Internet marketers that are Webmasters and do-it-yourself SEO but also corporate marketers should pick it up to learn about those conflicts, because it will help during cross-department discussions about the Website content and features.Those aspects are often not considered and costly when fixed later, unless you have a SEO consultant around all the time who covers it for you."
3,A Solid Effort!,"Robert Pino uses the model of success in the martial art of aikido to show how corporations today can succeed. Aikido believes in winning without fighting and in gaining a victory over yourself. In business, that means concentrating on building your own strengths, rather than trying to launch an aggressive attack. You deflect attacks against you by neutralizing your competitor and taking over his power and energy. Pino discusses ways aikido's philosophy applies to the business world and gives examples of how major companies have used this approach. This interesting, original book suffers from two writing faults: occasional long, difficult-to-read sentences and repetition of the same ideas. Nonetheless, we at getAbstract recommend this book to those seeking new strategies for strengthening their organizations in a competitive marketplace."
1,Unfortunate misfit,"As an expert on business strategy and Japanese and Chinese culture I have had a hard time reading this book. It is not original, it is not thought-provoking, it is not exciting or new. It is old wine in new bottles. Mr Pino clearly doesn't master the art of Aikido yet. If he did, he would not have written a book which breathes self-importance every page along the way. This book was recommended by a friend of mine who watched a CBC documentary apparently. He liked it, I didn't. Mr Pino still has a long way to go. He may be successful in business, he may even be able to sell his mambo jambo to 90 percent of the world, but he can't fool the shrewd and keen. If I were him I'd sell my business before anyone found out I was fooling them."
5,Great book.,"This book offers insight into our own relationships with our kids and how parents' attitudes ultimately affect how our kids react to various situations in life. It is a book about honor, what honor is, and how to teach honor to yourself and your kids. It is a book about how to live your life and live it well...and pass that on to your kids. It has already helped me to be a better dad & husband, help keep the house clean, and stop complaining and being negative. There are religious aspects to the book (many bible readings to look up). But, no matter if you are Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Atheist, etc., you don't need to look up the bible readings to get the point. A very good book."
5,Awesome,"I got to see them live at the gypsy tea room in Dallas, TX. It was an awesome show. After seeing them, I downloaded all of their mp3s, and I just can't get enough of their sound. Mark Greaney has a beautiful voice, and the music itself is godlike. Some refer to it as being anthem-sounding, which I feel does it duty. All of the songs are filled with passion, which, for me, is the most important thing. A great album!"
5,This is why you need to go across the ocean for your music,"I downloaded ""Snow"" on a whim and after the first listen I immediately left for the record store. The only other time I've ever felt that impelled to buy a record was upon my first listening of ""Muscle Museum"" by Muse. In fact, if there were any one band who I could point to as being rather similar to JJ72 it's Muse. Both 3-piece bands, both possessing lead singers with almost operatic range and emotion. Both bands are spellbinding, but JJ72 comes across as simpler and slightly less refined, which I think is to their benefit. So, go out and have a listen to any of their singles (""Snow"" October Swimmer"" ""Oxygen""). If you aren't hooked after the first listen, this probably isn't the band for you."
1,Frisbee,"Em, this album is really bad, the lyrics are just jumbled up nonsense and the music is predictable and boring. Go out and buy a pair of shoes instead, actually even if you bought just the one shoe your life would be enriched so much more so. DO NOT BUY this album there are far better musical sources. Your kitchen for example even the sound of a microwave or washing machine will be more inspirational and thought provoking than this ""thing"".Check out this site for album reveiws which are not clouded by the acne scarred artisanhttp://www.allmusicguide.com"
1,"Concepts, not reality","I read a lot of business books. The best present lessons rooted in empirical data, real-world case studies, and personal experience. This book has none of these. The authors present a number of common-sense hypotheses and back them up with a long-running hypothetical case study - a made-up company that exists only to reflect the authors' ideas. Add to this the tedious consultant-speak and the dated examples and there's no reason to buy this book. Except that it costs $2 used."
3,Partially practical,Discrete good ideas. But the book does not present solid practice evidence that the framework will work. The core is model and in many places the authors implied good quantifications. In real world it is hard to get near precise and one needs to handle many quantity and quality unknowns.
4,"A great ""how to"" book. Very practical.","About a year ago I was faced with a business problem to solve. My intent was to try and develop client offers which concurrently delivered value to the client, the employees and the shareholders. I had a conceptual frame work in mind but I didn't really have any idea of how to go about the task. Synchronicity at work - I had purchased a copy of ""The Value Enterprise"" about two months earlier but had not yet read it. I thought it might have something to offer. What I found was a well thought out ""How to"" framework to support my conceptual ""What"". After finishing the book I contacted Brent Wortman, we were able to do some work together with great results. I found the book to be an easy read, with practical application."
1,Wasted Stories offer little if anything New,"I've worked with the authors. From last to first: Wortamn has little or no motivation to get down into the real info to understand what is going on. Tully doesn't have the brain power and Donovan is nothing more than a flim flam man - a very good one - but still a flim flam man. The authors spend months selling projects to clients - pushing hot bottons - but not really understanding what drives customers, employees, operations. This book is nothing but drivel. Its logic is flawed: Because company x is doing poorly and company y well and because company x and y's returns correlate to my metric - then if I can change a companies metric - they will do well. The problem with this should be inherent. Too bad they waste so many companies time and money."
1,No scent whatsoever!,Sorry but these inserts are not aromatherapy at all. There isn't even a hint of a scent of lavender on/in or around them. They are nice to have as an extra cushion in your shoes but don't work with open-toed sandals because they keep slipping out of them. False advertising!
5,MUST HAVE!!!!!,"This book is a must have for any serious Bible Student. It is easy to understand and almost every catergory is covered. Some books are like reading a manual on how to fly. I love this book and I won't be selling it at anytime. If you want a reference material that will give you extensive, fully detailed information, then this is the book for you. Enjoy!!!"
5,Simply the Best!,"This has got to be the greatest collection of jazz standards ever compiled. Sung by the best. It's really an education in jazz music. Highly recommended for those learning to play the standards, and for those who can actually remember the day..."
1,Hate it!,"I bought this vacuum based on the Consumer Reports recommendation and on the reviews here and after living with it for a year, I finally retired it to the garage and bought an Electrolux Ultra Quiet Canister which I love. Here are the reasons I was not happy with this vacuum:- very heavy (made vacuuming the stairs very hard)- very, very loud- too powerful - sounds impossible I know, but when you start to suck up the corners of your carpets and shred them to bits and the edges of the curtains when you come within a few inches, you will see what I mean.- poorly made controls - they feel like they are going to break when you change the setting.After using it a few times, our house keeper started bringing her own vacuum and said that she thought ours was too heavy and blew too much of the dust around before sucking it up. We have almost entirely hardwood floors and are much happier with our new Electrolux canister."
3,Just ok,This vac is average or a little above. It is very hard to press the little pedal that releases the handle(you actually need shoes on to press it). It is quieter than any other we have ever used and suction is below average when using tools.
1,Unreliable Product and Unresponsive Customer Service from Eureka,My Eureka vacuum broke within 6 months of purchase - the motor in the vacuum died!! The Eureka recommended service center is waiting on a new motor from Eureka for over 6 weeks. My repeated calls to the Eureka customer service center requesting someone to follow up on the shipment of this part hasn't yet been addressed. Unresponsive customer service and unreliable product from Eureka!
1,Broke on 2nd use,"This may be a fine product. Indeed it seemed to be the first two times we used it. But the foot switch you step on to recline the back broke on the second use. Taking it in for warranty service this week. Now, every time you put the back into the full-upright-and-locked position, the foot switch pops about a foot into the air. There may also be a problem with the carpet-bare floor switch, which moves at random and doesn't seem to control anything. Warranty work so soon is ridiculous."
1,belt keeps on breaking.,good suction but have replaced 5 belts in last 7 months. CSR says belts not covered in warranty.each belt is for $10 .If buying this vaccum think twice
1,Only lasted 1 Year!!!!,"I read many reviews before I bought this vacuum and was impressed by this vacuum. However, mine did not live up to its reputation. The switch that allows you to move the handle fell off when the sweeper was 8 months old. Today when I was sweeping the vacuum just stopped. I have only had it for 14 months! I found the vacuum very heavy and very loud, too."
5,great vacuum,"After reading a review in Consumer Reports magazine, I purchased this vacuum. I have had the vacuum for a year and a half and remain VERY pleased. I have had no malfunctions of any kind. The sucking power is incredible both on hard floors and carpets. I have a slate floor in my kitchen which I am unable to sweep because it has so many grooves, but that's not an issue becuase this vacuum works great on getting everything out. Further, I believe some of the complaints in other reviews would be a non-issue if people made sure they flipped the switch to ""hard floor"" when not on carpet."
4,Eureka 4870DT - A good vacuum,"This is a great vacuum. It performs well on both floors and carpets. It's easy to use the attachments (especially since they are all located on the vacuum body). It may be a little loud for some, but it has great suction. It also has an assist for the forward movement; it does require a bit of extra pull on the return. Be sure to put your carpet setting possible one notch higher than yuo think."
3,Wonderful Vacuum But ...,"This is a wonderful vacuum in many ways. First, I love all of the attachments. They help me clean the carpet on my stairs and all the nooks and crannies and corners. There are two things about this vacuum that I don't like. One is that it's a real pain to switch from carpet to hard floors. So I often, with hard floors, find myself using the hoses and attachments. Second, it's heavy. It's 21 pounds. I live in a 2-story townhouse. Yes, I can carry it. It's got this little stair helper, too. But I just find that it's such a pain that I actually vacuum less. If I bring it upstairs as I'm doing the stairs or to do the bedrooms, it stays upstairs. And if I bring it down to do the hard floors, it stays downstairs. Yes, it's a doable weight. But at 21 pounds, it's no lightweight. Still, it might be the vacuum for you--just not for me."
5,Great Vacuum!,"This is the first vacuum I have ever spent my own money on. I am replacing my old Phantom that my mother had handed down to me.I must say, everything I have read in all the reviews was dead-on. This vacuum really REALLY works well, lets virtually NO dust of any sort up into the air, is relatively quiet for such an inexpensive machine, and cleans the carpet very well.The first time I used it the bag was filled approximately 1/3 of the way, and I don't have a very big home. I probably vacuumed less than 800 square feet. That means it REALLY cleaned the carpet well.The belt does seem rather thin so if you suck stuff up it probably would break easily. Solution: don't take chances, don't suck up the curtains or a sock.The valve on top that changes from floor to hose suction works great. I have a huge shop vac and the suction from the hose on the smartvac is actually quite competitive with the Powerful shop vac.Great buy, I'm glad I chose it!"
4,Great machine with one minor issue,"We bought this machine last March (2005) and so far, it's worked very well on carpet and our tile. No complaints there.The one issue I have is that one of the plastic clasps that hold the hose in place broke of after 2 months and the hose no longer stays in place very well. When I'm vacuuming and brush up against something, the hose falls off and I have to stop and put it back. Very irratating.Other than that, we've been very happy."
1,WHAT A CLUNKER,"Based on customer reviews and Consumer Reports, went to a store to look at one first hand. What a piece of junk ! You really have to fight the foot peddle to release from upright position and getting it to release is still easier than getting it to lock back in position. The wheels on it are terrible. You could just as easily drag the coffee table around the living room. It will not lay flat to be able to get under a bed and to get it to lower to I guess what Eureka calls flat you have to fight the foot peddle again to get it to lower the rest of the way. We then checked out a Bissell Lift Off. It impressed us enough to buy one and take it home. Very Impressive. This is what a vacuum should be. See review on Bissell Lift Off Vac."
1,Caveat Emptor!,"Major disappointment! After reading many positive reviews I was anticipating a real taste treat. In my case nothing could be further from the truth! If you like over-priced, tasteless, initially hard and then eventually gummy red glue, this is the one for you! To call it tasty would verge on being criminal! The unpleasant aftertaste will linger seemingly forever in your mouth unless you brush your teeth! The phrase ""rip-off"" comes to mind as does ""waste of money"". Do yourself a favor.....buy a nice fresh tub of tasty Red Vines and avoid this purchase.....much more satisfying and much less expensive!"
5,YUM!,"These taste so good! I've discovered now my favorite texture in the world. I bought these and my husband hardly got to have any of them because it was my new weakness. I will definitely be buying these again.The only downside would be that they seemed to be melted together slightly, but nothing a good tug couldn't separate. =)"
4,Review of Uppers & Downers,"I loved this album (can I use that term?), particularly the Uppers CD and the song, Oblivious. My great-niece really loved it too, especially the remake of Dream On. She just couldn't get enough of it, asking me to replay it over and over again so she could sing along."
4,The near complete missing piece.,"Finally there is a record of what became of one of the most influencial rock & roll bands in history. Don't be fooled by popular lore. The velvets did not end with the departure of Lou Reed, just as they did not end with the departure of John Cale. As Yule says in his liner notes, they merely changed.The ones whowant to continue on do. Pink Floyd was still Pink Floyd after Sid Barrett left, and even after Roger Waters left. This is the essential document of the Velvets end. There are only two reasons that I have not given this five stars. Number one, the sound quality is definately bootleg quality, but more important, the set should have included the ""Squeeze"" album, which is still un available."
5,Gives children the power over their fear of monsters!!,"This book, hands down, has been all three of my childrens favorite! It tremendously helped calm the inevitable fear of monsters in the bedroom. Maggie showed no fear in telling that monster to get out of her room, yet had no trouble rolling over and going to sleep when it refused to leave. She handled the problem on her own,with reassurance from her mother. This book was the best help I could have had when each of my kids reached the stage when they needed to learn that they had the power!(It also inspired me to name my third child Maggie!!)"
3,AAA and Network Security,"Though a thorough treatment of all the relevant aspects of the advertised elements of network security, the English is bad enough to be ambiguous and distracting and many places. A recommended work if the reader is prepared to be patient and diligent with the awkward use of the English language."
2,Frustrating toy,"My 3yr old son received this toy as a present a year ago and gets very frustrated by it. My kids, and their friends are attracted to it but once out of the box it is abandoned. It needs an adult/older child to put it together and once together it offers very limited hands-on play. It has little levers which you push to make the train change direction but apart from that they get to watch the train go around the track. We are big fans of the Thomas trains and love the way the kids can use their imagination to construct different layouts. This track offers no flexibility.The trains have to be set in certain positions so they can complete the circuit, our experience has been that the kids want to touch the trains and usually put the whole sequence out of synch. My 6 yr old can put it together but then has no interest in it.My advice is save your money and buy another piece of track."
1,Don't buy me!!!!,"I bought this product for my three year old for christmas. When we put it together the train cars fell off of tracks, the loader would try to pick up the marbles and fall off the track. This not a very durable toy. Within one hour of playing with it my son broke it. I strongly recommend that you not purchase this item."
3,A lot for a little,"My 3 year old Thomas fan received this toy for Christmas. Though it is fun to watch at first, it gets old quickly. There is little interaction required. Terrence is a weak link, and regularly gets the engine jammed. Also, it isn't very sturdy, and is difficult to move without having to take the whole thing a part. I was disappointed, as normally Thomas toys are such great learning tools as well."
2,Not as Fun as the Wooden Sets,"My son received this toy as a Christmas gift, and we were disappointed with it. Once out of the box, we were frustrated with the number of small parts, such as the tiny plastic balls which are used in the loader. These could be considered a choking hazard for younger children. Also, there is very little room for ""hands on"" play. The trains merely move around the track by themselves. My son became very frustrated with this and wanted to push the trains himself. I had to tell him that he would break it if he pushed them. I recommend that you purchase one of the excellent Thomas wooden train sets. They are much better than this set and allow for much more interactive play."
5,Modern Masterpiece,"Trippy.....and totally hip. Alternately mysterious and exciting. Always clever. Film noirish with a certain Chinese-Zen-Tibetan flavor. To be best enjoyed in a darken room, alone at night with a street light shining in. Highly recommended."
3,Assumes *a lot* of knowledge about cars!,"I don't know much about cars and I was hoping this would give a good idea of stuff I can do to take care of it without much work. Well, they recommended putting a huge amount of time into your car without much detail on how to do all the stuff they suggest. May be useful to someone that knows a lot about car maintainance, but wasn't of much use to me."
1,Horrible,"My sister and I watched this the other night. It was horrible. We didn't like any of the characters and had to fast forward through it. Sloppily edited. The main character had no backbone - guess that was one of the main points - but it was dreadful watching her give that fake smile as a response to well...about anything. We started yelling at her in frustration! A completely sappy, annoying movie. The best part was when all the daughters banded together to tell off their dad, after years of repressing their emotions, obviously. Geez! What a mess! A total trainwreck. If you like watching trainwrecks, this is the movie for you."
4,A perfect gift,"This book is an extremely human look at this famed institution of learning and discipline. There is something strikingly different in its tone from all other military tributes. Interesting choice of writers, thinkers and leaders heading up the list of contributors-- Arthur Miller reflecting on West Point? Yes, indeed. And what a reflection. This beautifully photographed, and meticulously detailed history is not a one-sided look at the struggle of ideas and policy, brotherhood and pride. A perfect gift for the not yet instinct, thinking, God fearing soldier."
3,Where is this product headed?,"It seems that whenever I need to order this product, one or more of the flavors is not available. That means that often I'm forced to purchase untested (by my dogs) flavors I would normally pass on.Where is this product headed? Will it be available at all soon? IAMS needs to make up their mind as to whether they are going to continue this product or not."
1,SORRY DVD,"WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY THIS SELF PROMOTION DVD FOR CROOKED I , DNT GET ME WRONG THERE A FEW INTERVIEWS THAT FOR A MINUTE WAS INTERESTING BUT OVERALL IT REALLY SUCKED !!!"
3,Mrs Bell and the mouse,"Salve! I would like to congratulate Mrs Bell on writing such a fine book, all though I have not read the book, I am taught by Mrs Bell and she is a fine teacher. Vale!"
3,Way Over Priced!,"This book is a necessity if you buy the student book and don't already know Latin. The format for Minimus is great. The problem is that it is priced for a classroom teacher who need to make copies for an entire classroom every year. I am homeschooling and added Latin at my son's request. I shelled out the money but was quite disappointed with what I received. It breaksdown to a little less than $1 per page. Considering I will only make 2 copies of the replicatable pages I really don't think it is worth the money.If the price of Minimus Secondus comes down, I may purchase it when we finish this one. However, given the current price I plan on switching to a different book."
2,Monotonous,"I purchased this CD because I'd only recently for the first time heard/seen the song/video for ""Lucas With The Lid Off"" which was amazing, attributable mostly to the Michel-Gondry directed video, although the song itself is great. The rest of the album is so similar to ""Lucas With The Lid Off"", it became immediately monotonous. I guess this guy is a successful producer now but, as an artist, he's very limited."
4,Just As Good As The First,"This album is a pretty solid effort but with a few flaws. The topics could've been better, and tracks 12-14 are useless. R.Kelly did his thing with G.H.E.T.T.O.U.T and Jay-Z with ""All of My Days"". The album is worth a listen but the fans would probably like the first one a little better."
3,Great Basic Introduction,"This is a good basic introduction to ""e-commerce"" if you can get past the first 7 chapters which are very repetitive and self-promoting. I particularly do not care for books that give numerous examples of what other people have done with their newly found businesses. I am interested in as much information as possible, as quickly as possible. Skip the stories.I am learning very quickly that people who write books about making millions are usually making their money selling those books. An internet business requires a lot of knowledge and skills that are not learned in an intro to internet riches. Read the book and expand your knowledge of every topic by reading detailed books and articles about the specifics. There is a lot they are not telling you. You need to know!!"
3,Good book but avoid some business models,"There are a lot of things to consider when starting an internet business - from what product or service to offer to web hosting and design. Scott Fox steers the reader through the maze in a very practical way, giving you everything you could possibly need to start a business w/out breaking the budget.This is a very practical book that shows you step by step how to get started. Online updates are also a click away.Update: I would avoid some of the recommendations for building content sites with ads and affiliates as I don't know anyone who does this successfully. Also, in the age of WordPress, this book needs an update on how simple it is to get a domain and get started."
5,Amazing inspiring - a MUST read,"If you were hesitating before you read this book, then there is no need for excuses anymore. Scott Fox provide you with all you need to know to get started and on top of that he tickles your curiosity and your inner entrepreneur! Don't check out of amazon.com before you have added this book to your cart!"
2,Boring,"Although useful, the book is boring. I had to force myself to finish it. Author constantly mentions and refers to his previous book and his website. It's annoying and irritating."
5,Internet Riches Review,This book was well thought out and truly walks you through step by step of creating your own online business. I believe that you will really enjoy this book and learn a lot. Kudos to Scott Fox for this book!
1,Very disappointed,"The curtains were far shorter than I anticipated. Because I only opened the box a few weeks after receiving the curtains (we were finishing up renovating the bedroom), Olive Kids refused to allow me to return the curtains as I'd passed their 14 day return policy. Very poor customer service."
4,"Nice curtains, a little thin",Overall I am pleased with these curtains. They look great in my son's room. The fabric is a bit thin but I can live with it. Just don't expect these curtains to do any work in keeping out drafts.
5,birders blend,"This is a very good all around wild bird food, only problem I have is that at the store I can't find the large bags, just the 5 pounders.Anyway, this feed seems to attract a generally all around blend of feathery critters, it doesn't disappoint and birds seem to guzzle it down quite fast.I have other feed, but I always go back to the birders blend as a basic feed,it will not disappoint."
5,Enigmas on a chess board in sweet voice,"This masterpiece is a true gift to the serious music lover.There is always a flurry of excitement in world chess tournaments: singular genius on each side, international politics and intrigue, personal life choices away from the chess board that consume each player and the audience as well. Josh Groban plays the Russian chess master in a strong and sweet voice. The musical score plays nicely with the choreography,illuminating life and death choices with each move on the board.One sees a variety of enigmas from which there appears to be no extraction, and these are truly heart-provoking and gripping. Music is emotion that must come out to the world from the depth of the singer's soul.So, we enjoy fine vocal performances that whet our political instincts and take us into our own emotional world of choices we make. I was very moved by this presentation at each viewing. I hope that the reader can reach that same state of emotional engagement and enjoyment."
4,Chess in Concert review - very good,Have been enjoying this concert. Josh Groban is very good and there are some other very good voices. Very well done.
2,Buy one of the 1980s CDs instead,"Warning: this is not a dramatic production. This is a concert, in which some of the singers pretend to act. Most of the space, and much of the camera time, is given over to the chorus and the orchestra; the singers with roles have a tiny sliver of space in which to sing, move around, even gesture--but not act. They don't emote; they don't really engage each other. Sort of like opera, but without the sets. I don't really see the point of putting it on DVD; there's very little to look at.I suppose it should've been clear from the title. I'm just glad I got it through Netflix instead of buying it. I'll stick with my copy ofthe CD from the Broadway production."
3,I'm a Josh Groban fan,I caught this show on PBS in progress and had to find out how it began and what the premise of the story was. Interesting concept and staging. It was delightful to see how Josh has grown in his performance. His anthem was magnificent.
5,great read.,"great charecter delvelopment, fast pace, exhilerating, amazing voice, interesting plot line, accurate vocabulary, beleiveable story of a genius junky who is neither good nor bad living a life that is neither good nor bad.recomended to everyone who's looking for a realistic somewart comical readyou can really get into this novel"
5,Tom And Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes.,For all Who enjoy watching a cartoon with their children. Well drawn exciting action .Plenty of humor. And for all Adults who enjoy a cartoon and seek Sherlock Holmes here is your chance.
5,"An intriguing blend of history, science and anthropology","Roberto Casati's Shadow Club about shadows goes far beyond their usual definitions to probe shadow's legends, influence on myth and religious beliefs, and changing scientific concepts of the shadow both on Earth and in space. Shadow Club is very highly recommended as an intriguing blend of history, science and anthropology which presents unusual insights into shadows and their lasting impact on mankind."
4,Not the old Uncle Henry,"I hope this is as good as the American made Schrade knives that I have used for over 30 years, the 4 stars are because of the really cheap sheath, and to be honest, it worries me that it is so cheap, if they are cutting on quality in one place who knows where else. I do think that they shoud try a little harder to let folks know that this is not the knife that was made here for so many years."
1,A $12 Copy of Sick Pornography,"Vampire is an adult game, yes. But does it have to be so horribly gratuitous? This clan adds nothing to the world of Vampire, and takes away a lot. I bought this book, and found it to be disgusting, distasteful, and, most of all, offensive. And I am not easily offended. It features pictures of nude women with insects crawling out of every orifice they have. It features graphic sex, violence, and is utterly and totally gratuitous about it. At least Clanbook: Giovanni, for instance, shows something with its sex and violence. All this shows is that White Wolf can sicken anyone if they try hard enough. You are not missing anything if you don't own this book."
5,DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE REAL LIVE....,Yo this album has some of the best beats i have ever heard and had me wondering why this album wasn't given enough attention. Larry-O's lyrical skill and flow ignites the track and the joint ends up bein' on fire. Explicit content for underground kats...cop the album if u love undeground hip-hop or if u love hip-hop at all. I wish more artists could be as real live as these kats. For anyone sleepin' on the Real Live i have one thing to say...Don't underestimate the Real Live.
4,Danze Faucet,As always a good transaction throughAmazon.com. The faucet installed easily and works well and is attractive. All intallation hardware was included excluding the flex hose.
4,"Value priced, good quality, limited design","I loved having single-lever faucet with a built-in soap dispenser & sprayer on my old Moen. Having a built-in soap dispenser means drips fall in the sink and there's nothing to knock over. This was the only affordable model I could find, as I wasn't up for spending $200-300.My installer was a diehard Moen/Delta/Kohler fan but was impressed by Danze's quality and ease of installation.However, whereas my Moen had a full circle rotation, this rotates between 7:30pm and 4:30pm. Once the water is hot, I can't go past 6pm. It takes more nudges to get to a workable temperature than my old one.The sprayer is weak and the ""cord"" is a little stiff and a little short.For value & quality I give it 5-stars and for design, only 3-stars."
4,Spiderman Fan Loves it,"Bought it for my little cousin, a die hard Spiderman fan at 4 yrs old, and he LOVES IT. The only issue is that after a while you have to pull the arms back up into place to get it to sing and spin at the same time, but it says that in the instructions. Otherwise it's lots of fun for small children."
4,Zen Debussy,"Sparse, often quiet and highly impressionistic, Takemitsu reminds me of Debussy in his skill at orchestral color and his ability to evoke strong images through sound. On this recording Patrick Gallois' lovely flute playing is the star of the show, weaving a strongly meditative mood in the seven pieces here (all 13 minutes or less).Takemitsu's mastery of the orchestra isn't immediately apparent because he used the (at times) huge ensembles he wrote for so sparingly, but his subtlties do indeed hold up to repeated listening. Still, less is definitely more in the world of Takemitsu, and those used to strong western-style musical discourse may find it lacking in substance at first. I for one have listened to his compositions many times and for me, it is always an interesting experience.Recommended for those looking for a softer, quieter, but still genuinely musical experience in contemporary ""classical"" music."
5,BEST GAME IN THE WORLD!,"This game is soooooooo fun! I totally think you should buy Dogz 5! If you don't buy this game, your missing out on alot of fun. I have a cute dog named Daisy. Oh, there's 15 breeds you can pick from. You can adopt as many dogz as you want, but they can run away if you don't treat them well. If you don't wanna play with your dogz, there's 5 fun mini games that you'll enjoy! So trust me, if you buy Dogz 5 you'll never be bored again! SO BUY DOGZ 5 TODAY!!"
4,Handy & Reliable,"This mini dictionary is easily placed in a backpack, satchel, or briefcase and is a handy reference for those times when you are not so sure of spelling or usage. I love it!"
2,Not what I was expecting.,"I was expecting a little....Ok, a LOT more action. Although the girls were nude, that was it. It really was a cooking show! Just like the title but I thought it would show more. After the girls were done cooking, the clip ended! And the dude that was interviewing them seemed to never shut up! I recomend you barrow it from a friend rather than buy it. Definitly not worth the money but not a total loss."
2,Not what I was expecting...,"I was expecting it to show a little....Ok, a LOT more. It really was a cooking show! Although the girls were naked. The clip ended when the girls were done cooking.......why? Don't get me wrong. If you read the title of the DVD, it says COOKING with porn stars for the Holidays. But I was thinking they could show a LITTLE more than what they did. And I almost had to watch it with the sound off because the dude talked way to much. It's like he was on speed or something. Not a TOTAL waste of money but I would recomend you borrow it from a friend rather than buying it."
3,Rose Colored Glasses for a Dying Industry,"I liked Economides book. It was well-written, entertaining and concise. Unfortunately, it simply did not reflect the reality of the future of oil, since the major forecasts for oil production all indicate that by 2030, yearly oil production will probably be no more than 30% of today's totals. You can check out Hubbert Peak for more information.Since the only energy security we as a nation can be assured of is an energy futre that we control from within our borders, if you want to read a book that more accurately reflects the reality of energy and the future we must build, read Power Surge: Guide to the Coming Energy Revolution by World Watch Institute."
3,The color of Oil,"This book is not too bad, it has chapters good as green colour chapter and black colour chapter and other that are not so good. I think that it is too subjective and has a patriotism air supporting United Estates against the rest. Also it is well written and simple to understand it. For sure that it will not be a master piece but it is interesting the thinking of the writers and Texas AM ( in my opinion one of most prestigious oil involving schools, I studied there). You can learn something about the book..."
5,Vida privada de Emmet Fox,"Este libro es clave para todos aquellos que quieren conocer íntimamente al señor Fox. Los relatos de su amigo Herman Wolhorn son muy detallados y traen consigo la radiación de cariño fraterno que da la comprensión íntima y camaradería.De todos los hallazgos valiosos encontré en sus páginas toda la dimensión esotérica del señor Fox: su creencia científica en la existencia de los Niveles Internos de conciencia y en la reencarnación. Además me llamó la atención la búsqueda que llevó durante toda su vida sobre los medios y maneras para sanar el alma y el cuerpo a punta de oración.Por último quiero señalar que toda la primera parte del libro, dedicada a mostrar los puntos centrales de la enseñanza de este maestro espiritual, brilla con luz propia por su acertada y ordenada selección."
5,The Best Way to Prepare,"5 Steps to a 5 is an excellent AP Calculus review book. Its comprehensive review of the AB curriculum makes calculus incredibly easy to understand. The sample problems and detailed explanations of their answers help students to gain a complete understanding of calculus problems as well as the ability to solve the problems themselves. Now that I have taken the AP test, I can say that this book is definitely the best way to prepare for it!"
3,Petz 5...,"I must admit I was a bit disapointed about petz 5, I was annoyed that ubisoft changed it so you play it their way if that makes any sense, you can't do any time forwarding, I can't find petz profile anywhere maybe it is just some place else but I think they took that feauture out so you couldn't tell how old your petz are so you can start breeding... if this were the first version I would give a 5 star all the way but this is the fifth version, there was so much more they could have done with it like password protection, more new breedz (rather than five), and so my rating would have to be 3 or 4 stars."
3,Catz 5,"This would be a great game for smaller children. It is a little older, probably made in the 90's but it is very cute and would be great for kids that love animals."
4,It worth the cost,I really enjoy men colognes and I often purchase different ones at least for trying them on.This one is fairly not expensive but provides you a pleasant and quite long lasting scent.At least it did on my skin.The smell is sweet and soft although masculine.I truly recommend it.
5,"Tallulah, You Naughty Thing You!","Yep- it's a keeper. Maisy is just so patient and wonderful, as always. But pushy, impatient Tallulah keeps showing up. What can Maisy do?? Nothing, it seems, cause Tallulah is going to do just what she wants, which is play with Maisy. This one caused some concern for my 3-year old son, who wanted to know if I'd be angry if *his* friend, ""a girl with braids"" came and took a bath with *him*."
4,Good Enough,"While they might have a low thread count, I really didn't care too much so they are perfect for me. Only issue I have with them is that when I washed the pillow cover, it came out very very wrinkly unlike other pillow covers I've used in the past. It makes it look kinda dumb, but I'm in no place right now to worry about my bed aesthetics."
2,Consider something else,"because I wish I did.They're thin, wrinkle easily, and only 200 thread count. My laziness is the only reason I'm not returning these."
2,thinner then I'd expect from 200 tc,"I no longer believe in thread count if these are 200. They're pretty thin but will do in a pinch for the guest room. Wouldn't buy them again. They blue is lovely, however, and the Tommy Hilfiger Logo is very prominent for folks who care about that sort of thing."
5,"Tommy Hilfiger Sheet Set Full, Cardinal Red",I was a little disappointed in the fact that these sheets really need to be ironed. I iron the pillow cases and the top of the top sheet.
4,"Pretty good, gets a little rough after a while though.",I use them for my dorm and they're pretty comfortable but don't expect anything more than what you're paying for in terms of quality.
1,DONT BUY THIS,"how annoyed am i ? today my son is 5 an aunt bought the tmnt monster jam truck ; so we ,supposedly, bought the battery to go with it. WRONG THIS DOES NOT GO WITH IT. SON HAS A TOY WITH NO BATTERY , WE HAVE A BATTERY WITH NO TOY. WELL DONE TOYS'R'CRAP. WILL NEVER BUY HERE AGAIN"
1,Not what I thought,"This book is not what I thought. I agree with the fellow who said it's like reading a science fiction novel. The author writes well but I'm on chapter 2 still waiting for something to keep me reading. All he talks about is being in a deep meditation-state and talking to a spirit guide. His ""conversations"" with this guide sure sound made up to me. I wouldn't waste my time or my money on this one."
2,non slip dashboard pad,I DID NOT LIKE PRODUCT BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ADHERE TO DASHBOARD AS I HAD EXPECTED. THE ITEMS THAT WOULD BE PLACED ON THE MAT ALSO DO NOT ADHERE. DISAPPOINTED IN PRODUCT.
1,Waste,"Its a flimsy product. The mat doesn't have a lot of surface area.The mat isn't suitable for slanted dashboards, I have to put it in the seat."
2,Not very good,With most things I order from Amazon I get them fast enough. The order was slightly slow then average and when I receieved the book there was junk inside of it that made the pages stick together. Overall had I known the condition of the book I recieved I would have spent the extra few dollars to get it new and faster delivery time.
1,RIDICULOUS!!,"I guess I join the league of others who purchased a Tyco toy this Christmas. I purchased the Grave Digger R/C truck and found out on that morning that it needed a seperate battery pak that was not included. All remote controll units I had previously purchased had this item included. It is now March and I still can't find one of these items. I've checked 3 different WalMart stores with no luck. I'd take the darn thing back to the store, but I ordered it over the internet. And he doesn't want something else - he wants this one! Sad to see a grandson so unhappy. Poohie on Tyco. Your'e worse than Mattel !!"
4,Thought provoking,The author presents interesting nuances about meditation and how different holy people have approached this type of prayer. It has provided me with a deeper understanding of my own struggles with meditation.
5,Outstanding!,"SIMPLY MUST READ MATERIAL FOR NOVICE AND EXPERIENCED INVESTORS ALIKE. WONDERFULLY WRITTEN ,HUMOROUS ,AND VERY COMPREHENSIVE. I'VE RECOMMENDED THIS BOOK TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS WITHOUT HESITATION. WORTH MUCH MUCH MORE THAN IT'S SELLING PRICE.AM AWAITING EAGERLY FOR MR. KELLY'S FUTURE WORK IN THE AREA OF STOCK INVESTING!"
4,wipes,Size of sheets easy to handle. Dog likes me to clean his teeth because he makes a game and bites the sheets like tug of war.
3,Slightly victorious grunting,"3 1/2Besides for its emotionally satisfying conclusion, some of the Paris improv elements have been integrated better before by the great player, and can come across as melodically repetitious. Of course much of Jarrett's searching solo style could be described that way, but even if it sounds a little less inspiring here, contrasted with two shorter functioning tracks will make this album an intriguing purchase for all piano fans barring Sun Bear worshipers."
5,outstanding,"The first piece is one of Jarrett's epic solo improvisations that has a considerable classical influence of the Bach and Beethoven eras. It is a wonderful piece of music.The other two are wonderful melodic jazz tunes.I would say the quality of the music on this album is on a similar level to the very best of his work.I'm glad to see it has gotten very good reviews, and why its cumulative rating shows as 4 1/2 stars rather than 5 is hard to fathom."
4,Yummy-and the jars make fun water glasses,Tastes great and the empty glass jars are keepers. Buy your preserves now before the price skyrockets due to the terrible bee situation from Colony Collapse Disorder.
5,Get the draws CD,"This is my favorite cd of all times. If you like love songs, or just have a date tonight you need this on. Don't sleep just listen to it on amazon. Its a crime the cats only have one cd."
3,Fun and interesting but fell apart,"This was a great gift for my 5 year old daughter who had wanted to make her own ""smooth stones."" It turned out to be an interesting project for us to do together. However it did take several weeks to tumble the batch of rocks included with it and by the end the unit was leaking gravelly grit. It is extremely loud and we kept it running in the basement for that reason. We could only make one set of stones because it didn't seem safe to continue using it after it began to leak."
3,Initial rock supplies,"We bought this toy as a gift for my daughter, who was looking forward to making the pieces into the beautiful jewelry shown on the cover box. The machine is easy to use and assemble, but the starter rocks supplied are too large, too angular, and too plain to create anything interesting or attractive for jewelry. We had purchased a supplemental package of tumbling rocks, which also left a lot to be desired so we are using rocks from our own collection. If the company really wants to get people (especially children) interested in tumbling rocks as a hobby, they should provide a better set of starter rocks."
1,Very Unhappy!,"This product was bought for my eight year old granddaughter who was very interested in geology and so excited to receive this. After reading all the instruction we set up the tumbler, it ran for two days and quit! The hassle to send the product back has not been worth it, but does confirm my attitude not to order items through the mail again."
1,"Loud, Long, and Boring","My son, a budding scientist, was so excited to get this toy home. No where on the box does it tell you that you will have to live with the sounds of rocks bouncing around a tumbler for up to 30 days and that the end result will be very disappointing. Step one takes 48 hours, step two takes14 days and step 3 another 7. We put the tumbler in our cellar and could still hear it all over the house. The rocks came out (my son had really lost most interest by then) and they were not very polished. It was not very interactive, just dump the rocks and grit into the tumbler and wait and wait and suffer through the noise for a MONTH solid. Think before buying this ""TOY"" (AKA: Parent torture device)"
2,It's a mess,"What fun is a toy if it leaks all over the place? When I turned it on, it began to rotate and the liquid splashed everywhere. I end up mopping the floors and drying the ceiling too. However it is a great Idea, if only it would work!"
1,Not for the impatient or noise-sensitive,Too noisy and takes way too long. I'd rather go buy crystals as the store. Not terrible educational either. Just take your kid to the stream and explain how rocks are smoothed.
1,save your money,plastic tank wore thru B4 1st rocks were finished. looking around after the fact it looks like i should buy a rubber tank. Grandson was disapointed
1,roch tumbler classic,"We purchased this rock tumbler just to do small sets of rocks but two things I find darn near impossible.. First no matter what I do it leaks.. So I put tape around the lid.. It helped a bit, but the worst is to get the top off.. Impossible once a little grit leaks into that seal. I sure would not order another till I saw how it sealed.. Got to be a better way."
3,Classic crafts rock tumbler Review composition.,"I was thinking about purchasing this product until I realized that the negative reviews outnumbered the positive. While reading the reviews I burst out laughing at the horror!Waste of noise,Waste of money and timeAxle wore outBarrel leaksHuge messLots of time for nothingMotor diedThe rock tumbler is very annoyingDull and without a hint of shineMisleading picturesThe end result will be very disappointingWait and wait and suffer through the noise for a month straightParent torture deviceIts a wonderful ideaWe no longer have a Rock Tumbler !All good advice, I have never seen such a bad review of any item. There must be world record potential here."
2,leaks,"I couldn't get it to not leak, I cleaned it multiple times made sure the grits weren't on the seal. Still leaked. It didn't polish them like I thought it would. I am going to look for a different rock tumbler not one made of plastic.Fun for my first try."
1,It never worked!!!,It never worked. We put it together and tried it several times but the water would always leak out and we would ultimately end up with a big mess. Buy a more sturdy and expensive rock tumbler.
4,Terrific Navigation System,"Works great, touch screen is very good.Only one small drawback, it runs out of battery preety fast like 2 hours."
1,Piece of Garbage,"Magellan Roadmate 800. This product should be shipped directly from the manufacturer to the garbage dump. I recently used this to go from Eugene, OR to Lake Tahoe, CA. The errors, misdirections, and mis-routings on this one trip are far too numerous to list here. I will give 3 for your amusement.1. While going South on Interstate 5 it insisted that I was going East.2. While sitting in the Wal-Mart parking lot in Red Bluff, CA, I asked it to direct me to the nearest Wal-Mart. It told me that it was 163 miles south.3. On my return to Eugene it routed me through Placerville, which is fine. Except once I got to Placerville it routed me off the freeway and through several streets and back onto the freeway, going in the opposite direction...twice! Also, you can forget about finding a rest stop on your way, it will route you 20 miles in the opposite direction when one is actually just a few miles up the road. Save your $600, buy a roadmap and a magnifying glass..."
1,Steer Away from Magellan,Had to give a rating so gave it 1 star - would have preferred to leave it at 0. The only thing worse than their product is their customer service. You won't be able to talk with anyone in the US. The 800 number is direct to India. They will repeatedly lie to you - and you never get to talk with the same person or a supervisor - they'll tell you a supervisor will call you back - don't wait for the call. You can call their corporate headquarters in the US - the only problem is that nobody is there. Steer clear - look at a different manufacturer - anyone EXCEPT magellan.
4,"Fine product, but not needed","This is a fine product, but not really necessary. It provided some cushioning in the bassinet more than anything else. I had a mattress, this mattress pad, a sheet, and then a Carters Keep Me Dry Flannel Waterproof cover, which was easy to change out whenever it got wet. So a waterproof mattress pad wasn't needed. But if you want to add a little cushion but still have a relatively firm surface for the baby, this is a good option."
3,Useful as a quick reference,"This book is useful as a quick reference when you have a specific question about writing or formatting a document and have a general familiarity with technical writing. If you are completely new to writing technical documents you will be better served by other books that provide more of a guide through the process and document types. This book could also use a section on how to work with professional writers, because not all engineers or scientists need to fully write or produce technical materials."
5,Perfect,They have a great product and it is exactly what i was looking for when i was online shopping that day.
1,Clone,"Lisa is hilarious and I love that she pushes those racial buttons. If you can't laugh at something sometimes, then you probably shouldn't be watching tv. However, if you want to own this DVD, forget about it. It's the exact same skit as her ""Take it Like a Man"" DVD, but less quality so I recommend just buying that one. Frankly, I'm a little disappointed that she would make two DVD's of the exact same show and sell tham as separate labels. I fell somewhat like the wool was pulled over my eyes."
1,Poor Quality,"I agree with others here. This is my first purchase of Lisa Lampanelli's DVD and this one's quality is beyond poor. The sound was terrible, you had to turn it up in some places and down in others. The picture quality was also terrible. Sometimes you couldn't even see her and the cameramen's shots were inexperienced, at best. I love Lisa Lampanelli and think she is hilarous, but will definitely try another of her DVD's for better quality all around. I too thought once I started watching it that it was a boot leg copy and thought I had been duped. After reading these reviews, I see that others received the same low quality that I did."
4,Good for Crosman 1377C,Powerful but they are somewhat cheap they bend easy.Buy them and see if they work out for you.
4,Gamo Rocket,"I tested out these pellets in my old Daisy 880. Now my old BB/pellet gun is not that accurate. However, I was not just going for accuracy. I was also going for what gave me the best grouping. I do not believe these are good for accuracy over 20 yards. Your riffle may differ.Daisy 8802 pumps20 yards60 degree tempGrouping: 2 5/8""I will say this, these pellets can punch through a lot of stuff. The BB tip sure does add strength to the pellet. If you are after a pellet that can hit hard on a large target, then these are nice to have. Keep in mind, the tip of the pellet is a little heavy so you might need to aim a little high."
5,"Gamo Rocket .177 Cal, 9.6 Grains, Ballistic Tip","Really accurate pellets through my Crossman rifle. No chrono available to me but the signature sound when it goes off is slightly different than the Crossman pellets I normally use, slightly higher (maybe faster?). They seem to do their job, the squirrel population in my immediate vicinity has been devastated. The lead surround seems to fragment when the pellet hits like a hollow-point should leaving the bb to do the penetrating. Well done Gamo!"
3,they look cool,i got these when i ordered my gun they look way cool and shoot pretty good i dont know if its me (i have been shooting all kkinds of stuff for years)i think they might not be as accurate as some pellets could just be me thoughthey arent bad though
4,Good Shocks,"I purchased these shocks to fit my 99 expedition 4x4. The front ones were not that hard as I had also purchased new lower ball joints and other front end pieces. So I replaced them while everything was apart. The drivers side rear shock was a pain because of clearance with the gas tank area. These shocks have helped with handling a great deal. The tires feel more planted. It feels a lot better to drive. I read a review and it mentioned that these shocks are the generic version of Billsteins. I don't know if that is true or not, but the ride has improved."
5,Fantastic Game,My 8 year old son got this for Christmas. What a great game! My son loves anything having to do with space and this game is fun AND provides so much information for him to learn. If you have a child who is interested in space this is a great family game for you!
3,"""Kon-Tiki"" Was Much Better","The shadow of the more nobly conceived and executed ""Kon-Tiki"" hangs over this book, although ""8 Men and a Duck"" still offers a vicarious opportunity for thrilling and exotic adventure. Many things inevitably go wrong on such a voyage, but this group of fellows were so unprepared, both technically and emotionally, that it was almost a surprise when anything went right. Their ineptitude is somewhat frustrating to read about. Don't they make them like Thor Hyerdahl any more?"
3,Not the Best . Only for Existing Bloomfield Fans,"This album along with others from the Post Butterfield Blues Band and Electric Flag era Michael Bloomfield varies in quality. This is not one of the best. Much better are ""My Labors and More"", ""Super Session"", or either live album with Al kooper. Also better is ""Live at the Old Wardorf"".Two of the songs on this album, Peach Tree Man and Saturday Night are also on ""Knockin' Myself Out"".Best track is Bad Man. As usual Michael and Nick combine for a terrific song.I don't recommend this CD to the average listener. If you are new to Michael Bloomfield, try the albums mentioned above (starting with ""My Labors and More"" and ""Super Session"") plus the Butterfield Blues Band and Electric Flag ""Old Glory"" albums.If you are big Bloomfield fan (like I am), it is worth getting for Michael's slide guitar work plus Bad Man."
4,"Good, but ouch!","I really enjoyed this book. It places Duncan within the historical context of Scotland, something rarely done. Ms.Roberson has done her research on the complicated period of Jacobite history well BUT, The King James in question was the SEVENTH of Scotland and Second of England - sorry, but it niggled - James II of Scotland got blown up by his own cannon in the 15th century. I'd like to see more of Duncan's adventures in his native land, perhaps in the present day as well."
4,Great Debut,Twistas first album is awesome. Its incredible how someone can spit so fast and still flow with the songs. this CD has dark grimy production which fits with twista. Go and check out this Chicago artist you wil not be disapointed.
5,Classic,"First off, this is NOT Twista's debut album, it's actually his third those the first two are hard to find, the second was never even officially released.Anyways, this album is just a striaght up Chi-town classic. Trust me, if you do not have this album, cop it. You won't be dissapointed."
5,TWISTA to twist ya!!!!!!!,"ADRENALINE RUSH WAS SNAPPIN ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE WHOLE ALBUM, ESPECIALLY WITH BUK KICKIN IT OFF, TOO. ALOT OF PEOPLE SAY THE BONES ARE TIGHTER, BUT I'M WIT TWISTA IN THA DOO. OH YEAH, WHAT'S UP WITH THE PSCYCHODRAMA ALBUM? I'M FIENIN' OVER HERE!"
4,"funny, funny, funny","I don't know what took me so long to finally read this book. The cover and title had me intrigued for ages. I also don't know how I survived my San Fernando Valley upbrining without this bible. But, now that I am aware of this authour, I am a devout follower. What a funny, original, in-sightful read this was. Very light and easy to get through but with some really brave, intelligent and all too real observations. Read it in the summer when you'll relate to her misery in the sweltering heat of the story's setting. I'll never attempt to go to the valley without this book again."
4,"A Strong, Confident Comic Voice","Sandra may describe herself as a loser and the pathetic eye-bags queen of the world, but she has a strong, confident comic voice. Her blistering wit, her love of hyperbole, her close observation, her fearlessness, and the way she sees through everything remind me of Tom Wolfe--if Wolfe were a young-ish, ethnically-diverse woman writer living in an unfashionable L.A. suburb. Highly recommended."
3,Not as bad as MacGowan fans make it out to be,"Ok, this isn't the Pogues of old. It's their sixth album, and Shane MacGowan isn't on it. Get over it. The last couple of Pogues albums WITH HIM weren't that great...he mumbled his way through the lyrics and that got old pretty fast, I think. He was such a hindrance and nuisance, being drunk all the time and not showing up for gigs, walking off stage in the middle of shows, that the band finally canned his ass. They moved on.This album features their biggest hit in the US, ""Tuesday Morning"" which would reach #11. It's a catchy tune, certainly more polished and commercial than anything MacGowan ever did with the band.Give it a couple listens and it will grow on you right away. Unless you're looking for Shane MacGowan, in which case you're looking in the wrong place."
2,It gets two stars cause its the pogues...,...but thats all. They should have just stuck to making insturmentals after shane left. Mahone could have been absolutly beautiful with no words. One thing to say about this album though...Herb Never Came
2,Not Worth Buying,"I have had this album since 1996, and I confess I still haven't listened to all of it. The band's lyrics are just not the same without Shane's creativity. The music is decent, although, in my opinion, The Pogues sound strangely like the Irish Rovers without Shane. The Irish Rovers are nice, of course--but they are not the Pogues. ""Tuesday Morning"" is the only song that I really like (of the ones I've listened to), and that one song doesn't make the CD worth buying."
5,OUTSTANDING,"From the moment I started this book, I couldn't put it down. Found this author to have wonderful knowledge of this time period. Would love to see this in movie form. Keep up the exceptional work, Mrs. Glass."
2,Knocking the wrong side,Patwant Singh's 'The Sikhs' is the same re telling of Sikh history written a thousand times before by a thousand different writers - most if not better certainly more qualified to write on the subject. Singh's USP is his inclusion of more recent Sikh history in independant India. Here Singh uses the book to blame the Hindu's for all of the problems with Sikhs today. This may have been fashionable with Sikhs 15 years ago but today it just doesnt wash. Singh knows which side his bread is buttered and fails to recognise the negative impact of the British on Sikhism during their days of empire building in the subcontinent. A really poor book designed to play on the emotional prejuidices of the Sikh diaspora.
3,The Sikhs,"The prologue of the book was very interesting due to the brief discussion and comparison done by the author between the Brahmins and the game of chess. What the author lacked to do was put more detail into the missions of the Sikh Gurus. Also the author makes statements, which are debatable, because he makes them without giving any references. Example of this type of statement is when the author goes on to claim that Guru Gobind Singh had two wives and does not give any proof of where he recieved this debatable information. Overall the book is well writen and suits well those who are new commers to the understanding of the Sikh Gurus and their mission and how it effected the history of the Sub-continent."
3,Just Okay,"They are pretty thin quality, flimsy even. The color is more dull than pictured. Even so, they are still the match to my dinnerware, but I expected more from this maker, always quality items in the past. I don't expect these will hold up very long and not sure of a recommendation."
5,Perfect for my wall,"Looks beautiful on my wall and blends well with all my other deco. It came quickly, and I am very happy with my purchase."
1,Is a Mask bounce even possible?,"I bought these at wall mart for a few (non competitive) games with my brother. These are the worst paint balls i have ever owned. If you were to shoot five at a tree directly in front of you 3 would not pop. In play the balls would always bounce off of the opponents. Even a few bounces off the masks. From 30 feet away i shot my brother 10 times (within 1 second) he had only 2 paint spots on him. These are only good for target practice, if that."
4,Great Price,"These work great and are a great price especially with Free Shipping :)The paint is watery so if you are using them for purely impact-great-if you want to see the ""splatter""-not so good :)"
1,Poor Packing,"Im in Kuwait, so i use my APO Address to get this stuff but when it arrive it dissapoint me BIG TIME. 2000ct is 1500 balls usable. The packing is so poor that makes ball squeeze each other until it breaks apart, im shock when i saw all the liquid yellow content around the balls.Suggestion: Check where the item to be ship to then pack it correctly."
1,Warp 2,"The very same thing happened to me. All I did was clean it with warm water and my dish cloth. (This was not a soak. This was getting some drippings off the surface.) I now have a warped board with an 1/8th inch split on the side. I've used this board only a handful of times. They make great knives, but I won't be back for one of their cutting boards."
3,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with this book. She includes a lot of information ... but completely leaves out the meanings of names! I'd have to have yet another baby name book on hand to complete what this author leaves out. I would recommend Bruce Lansky's Five-Star Baby Name Advisor instead, because he has all the information Wattenberg includes (minus sibling-name suggestions) plus meaning and how likely the name is to be spelled or pronounced incorrectly. Those are all good things for a parent to consider! Also, I realize name opinions are subjective, but I found myself disagreeing with quite a few of this author's; she seems to miss some pretty obvious drawbacks or associations with certain names, and has odd taste in names that she thinks *should* be used more often (Edgar? Really??)."
3,ok book,The book is good just not as good as it is made out to be a little helpful but still looking for more information.
4,Fun book for parents-to-be,"We are having a little girl in October and bought this book before we went away on vacation to help us select a name. Although this book does not have a sea of names like many of the 100,000+ name books out there, there is a wide-range of names to choose from. I like the methodology behind the book and it makes it much easier and more fun than reading through lists and lists of names. What is also fun, is that we can take names that we like but may not want to use and look them up in the book and see other similar name suggestions. I definitely recommend this book!"
4,The Best Baby Name Book Out There,"This is the best name baby book I've ever seen, but, with that said, I don't think any baby name book is really going to help you pick your baby's name. At the most it will help you to rationalize the names you already like.What makes this book great is that it takes a look at names in a whole new way. Not just the derivations or meanings, but also what names ""match"" that name and what people associate with that name. It also groups similar names together so you can peruse a list of names that you might actually like rather than pour through hundreds of names that you won't like.Laura Wattenberg is obsessed with names and naming trends over time. If you haven't taken a look at her blog then go check it out; the Baby Name Voyager is a must see!"
2,Name ideas really weird,I bought this book thinking that it may give some unique ideas and insights into names. Unique ideas it has... but so completely untraditional that I think any child with these names will be perpetually made fun of. I will be buying a different book.
5,A truely unique baby name book! None other like it!,"I am obsessive about baby names. I had baby names books years before we decided to start a family. I have 6 at present and am actually pregnant now.This is the only book that is unique in it' s layout and in the type of information it provides about names. A notebable acheivement in a genre in which it seems everyone is just reformulating every other books information.With charts, explanations, unique lists and ""brother"" and ""sister"" names, this book is sure to please parents-to-be like me who are information junkies and need more than just a regurgated alpha list of the same names over and over. The author is a bit sassy and some comments seem to made tongue-in-cheek, so it is a good read if you have a sense of humor.This is an excellent book and will certainly be a keeper in my collection, even after we name our baby!"
5,Perfect,"This is probably my favorite album of '06, and I don't really know much else about Shawn's music. It's beautiful, it's moving, it's sad, it's gorgeous. If you feel like an album you'll want to listen to over and over again, buy this one."
2,Disappointing,"Seen her live. Have a couple of her albums. Disappointed with this one. I usually like cryptic lyrics, but what the heck is she talking about. I don't get most of the songs. Musically OK but lacks excitement. Her production partner is talented but all the songs are starting to sound the same. Gave it a couple listens and gave up."
2,"Story line was okay, editing was atrocious!","The story was okay. It had some unexpected twists which make it interesting. There was character development that was irrelevant, but other vital characters were not developed at all. The editing of this book was absolutely horrible. Numerous misspelled words, improper punctuation, and subject verb ""disagreement"". I mention this because it made me re-read many lines just so I could understand the point that was being made. At times, it was difficult to understand who was speaking. For Mr. Carter's next effort (if there is one), he needs to hire PROFESSIONAL editors, not friends and family that ""write good""."
1,Where's the Music?,"This album isn't selling music, it's selling sex! Nothing new, nothing fresh, nothing to make an image for herself as a new rapper with her own attitude. Maybe next time."
5,Classic Hip Hop,"If you're into Niki Minaj then this is not for you. The title says ""Hardcore"" this was when The Notorious one was alive his production skills are all over this. Nothing Politcally correct here. I played this in the car and evryone wanted a copy, Not from me buy your own!Buy it:You won't be disapointed."
5,rad cd,"Yes, I'd like to say that this is one awesome album, and for those who don't like the profanity I'd just like to ask why you are even in this area writing or reading reviews. My favorite song on this album is Not Tonight..Yes, it's profane, but it's got a phat beat"
1,it's the worst stuff i ever heard,It's so bad that i not can say about this album that is worst and tihs that im out and say niothing more
3,A Theology of Worship,The book was received quickly and in good condition. The author did a good job on this subject. It is well written and well researched.
3,My guineas use this as a toilet,"My guineas don't cuddle up, they typically poop in this. They seem to like it enough, but really, its like a big toilet to them. Just to see what would happen, I added an old hood on top. Now they cuddle in it with the hood. I guess my guineas just like to be covered up when they cuddle."
3,Received NOT what the picture shows,"I ordered this, thinking it would be small enough for my little guinea pig to get in and out of, because that is what the picture above states. I thought THAT is what I would be getting, but no. I got a dark blue bed, that a cat could fit into. My guinea pig can barely crawl into it, because the side is too high for him. I ordered a small pet bed, not a cat bed. The product is fine, but I wasn't expecting what I received by any means. If you want a surprise in the mail, order this product. You never know what you are going to get."
5,"fluent, integrated, imaginative","Language was important to Monteverdi, and this recording is the first I've encountered to pronounce and perform the text fluently. The instrumental work, while elaborate and imaginative, never distracts unduly from the vocal lines, and the work is presented with an impressive integrety. Worth listening to even if you have another version."
4,Packed with sensible and thought-provoking advice,"Don't hold your breath if you're waiting for your company to hand out a blueprint for your professional growth as an emerging executive. In a book packed with sensible and thought-provoking advice, Morgan W. McCall Jr.'s overriding message is that aspiring executives are responsible for their own development. He believes that few organizations are structured to promote the proper training of young, promising executives, although they should do a better job. He says rising leaders should create their own breaks, embrace opportunities to gain experience, and view adversity as an ideal situation for learning. McCall hammers home the point that the only power you really have is over yourself. Be proactive, or pull up a lawn chair and watch as the parade passes. getAbstract wholeheartedly endorses the author's lessons on how to groom leaders and how to grow as a leader. If you want it, go and get it."
2,Coffee and Ink: How a Writers Group Can Nourish Your Creativity,I was disappointed in this book. It was more like an anothology than about nourishing creativity through the writing group. Maybe its intent should be restated of examples of how its members write. I didn't even finish it.
2,Not for all types of skin,This is my first electric shaver. I have pretty rough skin and i get a lot of ingrown hairs. I'm a dark hispanic male and the shaver isn't doing much for me. It isn't as clean of a shave as a regular blade. It does leave your skin smooth but it doesn't cut very deep as to remove all the hair. It has a great desisn and very easy to work with and to travel with but the cut is just not the greatest.
1,not recieved book,I have not recieved the book I ordered yet and it has been over a month.I switched my address but I have gotten other mail.
3,"Hockey? Not for me, thank you.","I got this book as a gift. Boy, this person doesn't know me very well. I don't like hockey. And this book doesn't help matters. Not at all. Its boring, and there are no interesting characters or plotlines. These guys that wrote this book clearly tried hard to write an informative book. I guess I recommend it for people who are interested in hockey."
5,Great..,I was glad to know all i had to do was to sharpen these the way I wanted them instead of someone else messing them up!! I have been told you always have to sharpen you tools when you get them anyway..
5,X Volume 3 Review,"This volume is great. I would give it 6 stars if possible. I think it is the best of all the volumes at this point. It talks about Satsuki's past and how she found out she was a Dragon of Earth. Fuma's father tells him that he is Kamui's twin star. Fuma then has a vision of the two of them fighting, and then Kamui killing Kotori. Kamui has a cool, exciting fight with a Dragon of Earth, Seishiro Sakurazuka. Fuma steps in and saves them both and Seishiro vanishes. Sorata and Arashi go searching for Subaru Sumeragi, one of the Dragons of Heaven, but Seishiro finds him first and the two have an intense battle. Seishiro leaves during the middle of the fight and Subaru then meets up with Sorata and Arashi. Subaru and Seishiro are my favorite X Characters, and their battle made this volume the greatest. Buy it, it's amazing."
1,Completely Under-Complex,"Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen have presented evidence that differences in national IQ account for the substantial variation in national per capita income and growth. However, these findings simply reflect inappropriate use and interpretations of statistical instruments. Secondly, the models presented by Lynn and Vanhanen are under-complex and inadequately specified...."
3,ultimate pak,"I think it was a good value for the prise. It has all the accessaries needed to optimize play between two or more players, example, linking two gameboys together to trade characters, also the car adapter great for trips to keep the battery charged etc."
1,Don't Buy This,"I bought this phone for a 3 person office and it does not do what it says it can do. The Auto Attendant only works only if that particular phone is not being used. If you transfer a call to a person who is on the line, then it wont' go to voicemail, but will just keep ringing."
2,Better than Roark's Formulas for stress & strain.,"This book has a lot of information most of which is useless calculus integration with vary brief summery which seems to me being derived from other books just thrown into the mix with general categories. The book is basically an oversized machinery's handbook but with a poorly written index and with a lot of inapt formulas that don't have a explanation for formula variables used in the equation. If you do a lot of strength of material design I would suggest a machinery's hand book, or the McGraw Hill Mechanical Engineering Design book which is an excellent P.E. exam reference book. Stay away from the Roarks Formulas for stress & strain book its more poorly written then the Marks."
2,Overrated,"""Mark's Handbook"" is one of those books you hear other students in college talk about like it's a must have that you'll use for the rest of your life. But it's not. I bought this book, and six years out of college I barely ever crack it open. It's packed with information, but it's so general that you can't get any real-world specific information out of it. It's like a restaurant reviewer who can tell you that ""New York has some great Italian restaurants"" but doesn't give you the name of any of them. You're much better off skipping this book and buying one that's more specific to your particular field. As an example, the mechanical engineer is much better off with Shigley's ""Mechanical Engineering Design""."
2,Poorly designed,"There is no ""positive"" hold for the battery so it doesn't keep slipping off. Not sure simple rules of engineering design couldn't be applied here.I learned my lesson."
2,Just not well-manufactured.,"I purchased this razor in December 2006. The good news is that it shaves well -- the bad news is that it falls apart pretty quickly. Remington has replaced mine three times -- the first time, the trimmer stopped working. The second time, the cleaning base started spewing fluid all over. The third time, the little clips that hold the head in place broke -- one broke OFF completely, and one disappeared into the body of the razor. I took VERY good care of the razors, but it's pretty clear to me that these are not well-manufactured. Remington customer service has always been very gracious about replacements, but I'm done with Remington."
3,jack review,"jack was what I expected, nothing special, was used to replace a jack that was broken. if you want to buy a jack buy it somewhere else and you dont have to write thes stupid reviews."
4,Just the thing!,"I wanted a case to hold my laptop and keep it safe while also being sleek and light. The added bonus of heat insulation makes it almost perfect. Now if it just had a pocket on the outside it would rate a 11 out of 10. As it is, I would call it a 9-3/4!"
4,My 5 year old daughter loves this game!,"My 5 year old daughter received this game as a gift, and although she needs my help to read the cards she loves to play this board game! It has more than one game version for you to play and educates you about the different markings on the horses, colors, etc. Great gift for the horse-loving girl! I bought 3 games online after receiving it, so I now have them to give as gifts to her girlfriends!"
2,Not for the suburbanites,"Based on the reviews, I purchased this game for my 9 year old neice who ""is into horses."" Well, the suburban concept of ""into horses"" was not enough to make her like this game. She didn't relate to it, there were too many horses and the games did not grab her."
1,This product is a resource hog!,"I installed this program, and I did like the look of the program and a lot of the features.However, after installation, my computer slowed to a crawl. When I looked at the ""processes"" and CPU usage, I found that my CPU was > or = to 70-100% usage at all times. There were multiple McAfee processes running as well.I had to uninstall the program because my computer was no longer functional. I was able to do a virus scan and it did find some adware that my Symantic virus-scanner didn't.My computer is a 2.08 MHz AMD Athlon 2800+ processor, with 512MB RAM and 120GB HD. The box recommends at least 256MB RAM, which seems laughable."
1,Dont' Buy this program,"I installed this on my laptop and it slowed it down to a crawl. I deinstalled it , installed Norton 2005, bought the subscription Renewal and my laptop is back up to speed.You have been warned"
2,It hates itself,"As everyone else has said, this product is not at all what it should be.It slows down the internet browsing to a crawl (my laptop that has crashed several times, is several years older and runs wireless loads pages faster than my new computer with McAfee).You can't close it, as others have said, other than uninstalling.The funniest part I've found, however, is that it warns you the first time it tries to access. Being amused, I refused the program permission to update itself. Other than removing the program, it was the best thing I did using McAfee."
1,Not recommended,"McAfee Internet Security will take your otherwise satisfactory computer and wreck it. All your resources will be tied up operating McAfee. You won't need to worry about viruses, you'll be too frustrated to even use your computer. Look elsewhere for this sort of software."
4,Good Product,"Works great, much better imo than the air powered Dynabrade I was using. Only knock is the spanner/hex wrench was not included, despite being listed as included."
5,Makita Polisher Buffer,"Great Product and fast shipping .I detail Boats and Yachts and have been using the Makita polisher for over 13 years,its light weight and the speed control makes it the best."
2,This is not a .Net book,"Some good material in this book that are related to N-tier design, but not a .Net book at all. Less than %20 of the book had anything to do with .Net. It looks like the book was written 2 years ago and then .Net was added to the title to better market the book. I had to return mine."
3,"""Quark Xpress and Photoshop Four Comic Books""","This book is more a specialized ""how to"" manual for specific software than a ""definitive guide"" for computer owners who want to make comics.It is assumed by the author that the reader has three programs: Photoshop, Illustrator, and Quark Xpress. No other programs are ever mentioned, if you use anything else, this book was not written for you.The author provides excellent information about how printing in color works, his hints on getting your colored artwork to look good on paper (as opposed to on your monitor) make ""Digital Prepress for Comic Books"" a worthwhile investment.The book is, however, plagued with childish spelling errors--""there"" instead of ""their,"" ""use to"" instead of ""used to"" etc. Considering the cost of the book, it could have benefitted from a proofreading."
2,Interesting,"This recording by Kerilos covers a lot of the same material on the Paniagua CD, however, the Kerilos version is far more sombre in effect (sombre is good). Paniagua's treatment is tighter, wittier and more natural. The solo singing on Kerilos is far too operatic, souring the mood and the heavy French-accented Greek recitation is hard to forgive. I personally enjoy this darker rendition, but it does have its failings."
5,Love this Song!,"I originally heard this song while watching ""Kung Pow: Enter The Fist"" (which, by the way, is hilarious, but you need a certain sense of humor to enjoy it...It's pretty silly!) This song plays during the closing credits. At first I didn't really pay much attention to it, but then it started to grow on me. After about 3 or 4 listens, I was skipping to the end of my Kung Pow DVD, just to hear the song. I love the blend of traditional Indian zithar (spelling?) and a fast-paced beat that a bar with a dance floor or a club could play. This song can also be heard in the movie ""Vanilla Sky"", (listen for it while he is running through empty New York at the begining) but disappointingly, it's not on the soundtrack. The only thing I would change about the song it the way it stops and the zithar plays solo for a few seconds, then starts back up again. Other than that, it's a brilliant song...give it a few listens!"
3,Interesting essay,"Bloom describes the main religions of the United States in a very comprehensive analysis, not suitable for beginners. I would have liked the author to include more information about each religion in order to achieve a better understanding of them."
4,Decent,"I picked this album up at random while at the store one time. I was pretty wary since I'm usually not much of a doom metal person. I was wrong, this is definitely a good album for the overall metal fan. If you are not into darker bands, you will probably not like this album. The progression of songs is interesting too, as the vocals switch from death to clean often. There are epic sounding songs, as well as thrash/speed sounding songs as well. I think it works out well. This is by far not one of the most defining metal albums to date, but it's certainly a good buy."
3,Okay at best,"Good for freshening up the carpet, but I expected more from a deep cleaner. Doesn't really do anything for stain removal, and it leaves pieces of carpet fuzz all over the place from collecting on the brushes. Construction wise, the plastic handle on the top feels like it could break any time you use it. The bucket is easy to empty and clean. Putting in shampoo is also fairly straight forward. Anyways, mixed feelings on this one, it does an okay job, but plan to do more work for stains and such."
2,Made for large people,"I do some pretty extreme hikes & I always had my camera either around my neck giving me migraines or, in my backpack missing all the shots.This product was obviously made for a large person. No matter what I did, it would not adjust to my size. Other than that, I think it would have worked great. I gave it to my bosses buddy , who is a large person and bought a smaller one from other company."
4,STATUS QUO AT THERE BEST,"I bought this album before the bounus tracks where added on, but i am not complaining,no pun intened.Standout tracks where the title track ,and every time i think of you.These guys continue to rock and i hope it never stops."
3,bird cage,I'm not crazy about it. The bottom grate dosen't stay on when you remove the top to clean;therefore;the birds keep getting out and stuck under it. Then I had to juggle the top with two birds in it and the bottom with the other bird sruck between the grid and the top. The grid should stay in place when you remove the top for the safety of the birds
5,Vison Bird Cage,"Great bird cage, controls the seed from going every where on floor.Highly recommend. Easy to get to the feeders and clean. Anothergreat tip is use Tiomthy Grass on the bottom and it looks good andthe birds like it. Costs little more but well worth it."
5,happy in miami,Great cage and easy to put together and great product.I love the design and keeps my floors clean. I hope this maker keeps up the good work and gets better..
4,one of the best of lindsey's!,i have read quite a few of lindsey's books before and find this one of her best! the plots of this book is really very true and..i just love the way derek treat kelsey...so caring ..so tender..~!
4,where is jeremy' story?,"Say you love me is a great book as are the rest of the malory books, but I cant help wondering about Jeremy Malory and can't wait to get my hands on his story. Is Ms. Lindsey writting a book for him? If any one knows , let me know!!!!"
4,Say you love me,"Very refreshing, this book is not the usual romantic novel. It's very sweet I absolutely fell in love with the hero."
3,Hilarious but not too useful,"Those Wacky Setites! This book is one big Sob story about how all the other clans (meanies that they are) MADE them do all the evil stuff. But once you get past that and stop laughing (which took me quite a while) the book provides useful info on setite paths, rituals, merits/flaws, etc. A good book, but for me it was better to set the mood than to have practicle use. It could have told us a bit more about Set himself."
1,Very poor sound quality!,"I love Tolle and was looking forward to this but am very disappointed in the sound quality.This should never have been put on the market. A waste of money.I recommend very highly Tolle's 2 disc DVD ""The Flowering of Human Consciousness"" if you can find a version playable on American DVD players. That one is definitely 5 Star in every way!"
3,a good experiance.,"Okay, I tried this product for the full 15 days, it had me running to the bathroom often. I dont really notice much of a change other than some how I produced enough poo to go 10 times a day for a few days (not the whole 15 days though). I definately feel glad to get all that out. I didn't have any side-effects. The pills do not taste especially good but it's not something that will make you hurl. I built a tolerance to them after the first week."
2,No change,"I was skeptical at buying, and should have listened to my gut instinct. Food and exercise are the only way to lose weight."
3,Works OK,"One thing I did notice when taking this product was a flatter stomach and significantly less bloating. What the product did NOT do for me is make me lose weight or make me more ""regular""."
2,Not that impressed,"This product has not helped me become more ""regular"" and I have not noticed any additional weight loss from taking this product. Everyone's body responds differently, but to me, this has really done nothing. I wasn't expecting it to be a miracle pill, so I've been on a reduced calorie diet and hoped this would up the benefits. So far, nothing. I took 2 pills twice a day a few of the times, and one of the times had horrible cramping. So I just take two a day right now, and maybe that's where I'm going wrong, but I didn't want the cramping that came along with a twice daily dosage. Also, it tastes HORRIBLE. Even chugging with water, the taste will not leave my mouth for about 30 minutes after. It tastes like tree bark, which in a way, it is. Overall, I don't think it was worth it."
2,It's ok,"Well I wanted to lose some weight,it didn't work for me,I end up putting more weight.It might have worked for others but not for me."
1,If I could choose no stars I would,"It was a poorly written, disorganized book. Not worth the paper it was written on or the money spent on it."
1,Another Afghan Disappointment,"Yet another book about the ""Great Game"" that isn't great, and has no game. No sense of person, place, or time can wriggle past the stifling ooze -- consisting of equal parts journalistic drone, hoary cliche, and predictable modifiers -- that lies, awaiting unsuspecting readers, between the covers of this tome. MacIntyre deserves to be applauded for his research; he should have hired someone else to do the writing. Here again we have a fascinating subject rendered lifeless by low-level prose. You want to know about this stuff? Read Kipling. He, at least, was not guilty of adverb abuse."
3,"Cute yes, but smaller than I expected",Yes the earings are cute. But based on the picture I expected the earings to be bigger than what I received.
1,Bent then BROKE the first day,"There are some other snake rings here that are great. This one is very misleading. My girlfriend tried it on, it was very maliable and was like almost a paper clip is the best explanation I can give you. it bent when she delicately slipped it on and it broke in half when she took it off to wash her hands. DO NOT BUY!!! I'd seriously take a good look at the seller and be careful with their other products. Couldn't be worse. Also they refused to take it back and said thats the way .925 sterling is, sometimes it ""breaks"" unbelievable!!"
4,Riding High~Eddie Kidd,This film was filmed in my local town and the jump over the vaiduct is 5 mins away from my house.
1,Cut Your Losses: Return Your Copy,"It was difficult to figure why this book received so many one-star ratings until it became apparent that the zero-star rating this thing deserves isn't available. Farrell is an extremely mediocre writer: he tells (and tells and tells) the same thing ad nauseum, instead of showing. He is neither funny nor entertaining. Typos and grammatical errors abound. None of this should matter in what purports to be a technical volume; unfortunately, the ""techniques"" the ""author"" purports to ""reveal"" are completely inane and akin to making a living picking pennies from under a freight train in motion. In addition, many topics advertised on the jacket hardly figure inside the book, or are dealt with in one page. This volume should be a huge hit on the 25-cent garage-sale circuit. I'm returning my copy for a refund right now."
2,Repetitive but Interesting,"I also found this book very repetive. The author uses the same sentences over and over again. This book would be great for a person who can't absorb the written word on their first reading of a sentence. I believe the formula will work, but the author does not tell you about the down side of his system. If it is so easy to make money in the stock market, more people would be staying home day trading."
3,Not so fast,"I tried the method and even opened an account at a daytrading firm to have the best equipment. The problem is you will sit for hours and then if then just praying the bid doesn't drop before someone comes along and buys your shares. He says you will make money in stocks that don't move and maybe, occasionaly, this will happen. The reason the stock is not moving is because there is no activity in the stock. You can sit at card game but if no one is dealing cards then you will lose precious time and make no money. The technique I liked was buried in the back of the book under momentum trading Nasdaq or NYSE. As a daytrader, the momentum trade is a great way to make nice gains, minimize risk with as little as 100 shares. I wish the book spent more time on those methods, which I promise are better daytrading methods then the sit until you rot method. However the book did explain how the NYSE system works and that alone could be worth the book price."
1,RIP OFF,"What disappointed me the most is that after reading this book, I could not find a single recommendation that would help me day trading. Also several technical errors leave doubt as to the quality and depth of the research done. Can I get my money back? Probably not.And don't bother reading this book either even if you can borrow it; you will waste your time. The book is nothing more than a promotional brochure for an expensive course that will probably come out soon. There are no secrets to be revealed"
1,THIS BOOK IS COMPLETELY WORTHLESS,Sitting on the computer all day to make 1/16ths? What complete nonsense. This book is completely worthless.
1,SELF-PROMOTIONAL AND REPETETIVE,I found there to be very little useful information here. I returned this book;very disappointed.
1,you will not be a day trader if you read this book,"The content of the book can be sumed as: In low volatility stocks, a day trader exploits the spread by using limit orders instead of market orders. In this way, the day trader trades with the market maker and makes teenie profit everyday.This book tells it over 230 pages. It repeats himself many times. It was not useful. You had better choose another book."
5,"Be real, egnore charts and learn the secrets of Day Trading.","This book is one of the best books that I have ever read. He writes from his heart and he says it in a very understanding way. He egnores all charts and past of the stocks, because he teaches the secrets of day trading. He beleives that if you want to make money in a matter of minutes nothing would help you but the information that you get based on your real time quote. If you want to be a good day trader and just a good day trader read this book. You will find his methods very logical and understanding."
2,"theorie sounds good, but in reality?","This was my first book about day trading, and I got very exited about his ""easy way to skim the market"" for 1/16s ALL DAY LONG!!! But reality was different: The stocks he mentioned to pick are most likely traded in lower volume. Lower volume means, it takes forever (sometimes I had to keep the stock overnight and dump next morning) to buy or sell. It also takes hours of intensive search to find a stock, that meets all in the book described criteria. I realized the hard way, that there is no way to make a living with these techniques.They might have worked a couple of years ago, but the market adjusted very fast, and as the author says: the specialists don't like somebody else taking their food out of their mouth. For inspiration purpose and the rough introduction to the markets I give this book two stars."
3,"Jerald is Finally Back, But Not Alone","This is the first recording by Jerald Daemyon since the awesome ""Thinking About You (featuring ""Summer Magic"") was released in 1995. As the title indicates this is a collaboration with a group of other musicians and several vocalists. While this is entertaining, don't expect the mind-blowing violin dominance of Jerald's earlier work. It should be noted that Jerald was supposed to have released a recording called ""Jerald's Groove"" in August of 2001. However, it has yet to be available for purchase. I am waiting and hoping that that effort will be more reminiscent of ""Thinking About You"". In the meantime, for those who are starving for jazz-funk on violin, I hope you know about Regina Carter, Doug Cameron, and Noel Webb."
4,Woody Allen Movie,"I am giving a course and am using this for presentation. This is one of Woody's least favorite movies because it has been rewritten, but it is funny and popular and many people love it."
1,Blows Like Blofeld,"It's just a bad screensaver with pics heavily skewed towards the Pierce Brosnan movies. You could create a more interesting screensaver in 5 min by downloading your own free Bond pics online. I generally love all things Bond, but this screensaver and Halle Berry's dopey performance in Die Another Day are the two exceptions."
1,Don't buy this,"I just purchased an upgrade from Studio MX 2004 and cannot change from a windows based pc to a mac. Macromedia was a great company, never a problem. I will not purchase ANY other product from Adobe."
5,Scary good,"This is the best and most thought-provoking book I have read in a long time.Sam Harris is an excellent writer and presents his arguments with clarity and ingenuity. He questions why reason and evidence is what makes people believe in propositions in all areas, except in that of religion, and points to the danger with this one exception, the danger of blind faith. He challenges religious dogma, yet recognizes the need for spirituality.This is a book that needs to be read by as many people as possible, even though I fear that it will be disregarded by people of faith.Read it and open your eyes!"
3,Difficult to enjoy. Harris could do much better.,The combination of poor organization and long sentences using advanced vocabulary words made this book difficult to enjoy. I also think Harris comes through as arrogant and condescending. His discussions would be much more welcome if he would refrain from cheap shots at the oppositon.
1,"Misguided faith, indeed","After making some excellent points in the first 135 pages, Harris stumbles badly, and does not recover, once he attempts to claim that U.S. crimes cannot be compared to those of others because the U.S. is, in fact, a ""well-intentioned giant"". That Harris would buy into this argument in the face of historical fact points to the existence of a patholigical faith of his very own. His paragraphs addressing the My Lai massacre and his interpretation of so-called ""collateral damage"" explicitly demonstrate Harris' abject ignorance regarding the deliberate and systematic violence visited upon those who oppose U.S. hegemony. Harris may have some insights regarding religion, but his abysmally flawed understanding of geopolitics leads me to question his entire premise."
4,sceptic,A very good title. Substance a bit predictable but covers a number of areas well. I just wish authors in this genre would think more about what challenging questions we ought to rehearse and fire at believers in the sort of pre-enlightenment superstitions and fairey tales he describes. Reason could then be used as a tool instead of something being lost post 9/11.
1,Sorry I bought the Kindle version,"Needed this book for a class and was so excited that I could get it on my Kindle......yeah, for the first time ever, I'm sorry that I bought a book on my Kindle - can't sell it, can't even donate it......."
1,Disappointing,"The review dated August 9 does a far more detailed critique than I am willing to undertake, and admirably addresses the failings of this book. As stated, this is a book best chosen by those looking to indulge in an articulation of their own views, but it inevitably fails to provide even that. In addition to being inconsistent within his own established guidelines of secularity, Mr. Harris is, quite frankly, a little scary.Rather than looking for ways to deny our Creator's existence through the active solicitation of errant philosophies, potential readers would do far better to turn with an open mind to such works as The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren or, for a really fascinating read, The American Prophecies by Michael D Evans. Our loving Creator waits for you!!"
1,The Bible of Lucifer,"Sam Harris is the Devil himself! The book insults God, and God is almighty. He rules us all, and you must believe that he is good otherwise he'll throw you into a torture room where there is no escape! That's how good God is! If you read this, you're the Devil!I fear for mankind because of this book.God is a good and merciful ruler, that's why he beat up Job to show how much he loved him. That's why he sent fire down on Sodom. That's why he made his son suffer a long, quite unnecessary death for our sins. Some people say he's a bully, but not me! He is God almighty, and if you don't worship him, then you're the Devil."
2,Simplistic and dangerous,"Ultimately this is a thinly disguised right-wing rant that supports intolerance of religion in general and an atheistic crusade against all Muslims in particular:""Some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them."" p.52-3""The only thing that seems likely to persuade most Muslims that their worldview is problematic is the demonstrable failure of their societies."" p.133Goes to show that denying religion does not automically give your arguments objectivity, much less any moral value. Sam Harris has recently praised the views of European fascists which shows the direction his own worldview is headed."
4,A nice book,"I give this book only 4stars and for good reason. Yes these monotheistic religions do pose a threat to the future of humanity. However, the specific threat of Islam is blown a bit out of proportion. While Muslims scholars did not issue a sufficient number of edicts and sermons against terrorisms at the time of the writing of ""End of faith,"" they did it and using strong language in the most recent Arafat sermon during the 2007 pilgrimage.Additionally, as someone who lives in Jordan and spent a good amount of time in Lebanon I can say with a good amount of confidence that what he writes about honor killings in Jordan and Lebanon is 30-50% blown out of proportion. I would greatly advise Mr.Harris to come and visit these two countries to get a more up close view."
4,Great overview of religious extremism,"You have to love Sam Harris. Harris really gives a good overview of how all religions are extremist at their core. He argues that there is no such thing as moderatism. I kind of disagree on that point, thus the four stars instead of five."
2,Strong Start; Weak Finish,"Perhaps it's ""only in America"" that a book which purports to attack superstition can end up reaffirming it.The early chapters are pretty good. But it's rapidly downhill from there.For example, after explaining the drawbacks of torture in the ""war on witchcraft"" (EVERYBODY ALWAYS CONFESSES!), the author turns right around and ENDORSES TORTURE in the ""war on terrorism"".In fact, he's a ""war on terrorism"" kind of guy -- going so far as to favor a U.S. pre-emptive nuclear attack on any Muslim nation with nuclear arms. (!)Then the book dribbles away with Buddhist babble and mindless yap about ""spirituality"".If you're an atheist -- that is, rational on this subject -- you will be very disappointed in this book."
1,REMEMBER THE VICTIMS OF SECULARISM!,"Please, all those of you who read this book, remember that in the 20th century, tens of millions of human beings died premature and agonizing deaths because of the fanatically secular politicians who led their countries to war. Hitler, Stalin, Churchill, Roosevelt, all were secular men. Religion was not an issue when the Turks committed the genocide of Armenians, of Greeks and of Assyrians, when the French massacred the Algerians, when the Japanese invaded China, when the Americans decimated Vietnam or when the Tutsis eliminated the Hutus.If the human species did not have faith in bigger and nobler values, then this planet would be such a dreadful place to live in, and all hope for a better future would have been lost in the cold meanders of the mindsets of secular skeptics who replace God with themselves."
1,Anti-faith views will get us no where,"Harris' focus is off! The real problem is a small percentage of radicals in each religion that want to interpret their religion according to their own small minds. To blame religion as the problem for ills of society is as small-minded as those radicals who interpret religion in extreme, self-serving ways. Religion (i.e. Christianity) is all about the service of others and selflessness."
1,Shame on Dawkins,"While discussing the dangers of Christian/Islamic practice, Harris also demonstrates quite clearly that he is a religous thinker himself, accepting concepts such as ""spirituality,"" ""mysticism,"" and even the possibility of psychic powers. (How responsible is it to suggest precious resources be spent on studying concepts than have no sound theoretical basis?) An atheist would have simply discussed the emotional needs and eschewed terms acknowledging the existence of a soul. I find it particularly disturbing that Dawkins provided Harris with an endorsement. Atheists need spokesmen who are less muddled-headed."
4,great and then not so great,"Some issues (dangers of extremism and fundamentalism especially) are treated thoughtfully, thoroughly and largely objectively, and the book is well worth reading - a real breath of fresh air in a world where criticism of religion is not tolerated, but as he continues on about the dangers of religionism, Harris merely replaces the three major world religions with ""religion"" (under a pseudonym) of his own liking, despite his avowed atheism. Overall, I loved the first two thirds or so, despite his numerous misunderstandings (of mysticism and rationalism, for example) and consider it a ""must read"", but was disappointed the last third of the book."
3,One of the discs was defective and wouldn't play. No. 7.,"Sam Harris is a very interesting speaker with lots of good information.Some of it was a bit tedious, but I enjoyed it."
5,Read Sam Harris and Spread the Word,"If by the end of this read, people of faith are not seriously reconsidering the doctrines they previously subscribed to then I would feel confident in saying that there is likely no hope for that individual's ascent from the abyss that is religion."
2,NASTY,The pills were fine and i felt good from them alone but the fiber drink was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. By day three i couldn't even do it. i tried mixing it with juice and now i have taste aversion to the juice. i also tried mixing it with lemon water and plain oatmeal (i know i wasn't supposed to have oatmeal on the cleanse but i was desperate!). For those of you who were able to use the cleanse- kudos. This was not for me. I can't even think about the fiber wood chips.
3,5 day fast and cleanse,Well I took this product for two days now and I don't feel to hungry. The craveless pills really work and I only feel hunger when its due for me to take more. I however had not had any bowel movements yet which I thought was strange. The fiber powder is gross and I could only drink it with the naked green smoothie. I did cave and ate something today because I felt like the only way I will go to the bathroom is if I eat something. Plus I started a cold and its not good to fast a cold. The pills were not to big to swallow like other reviews stated. It is annoying taking like 20 pills a day. Price is reasonable when I compaired prices I found one kit for $28 plus free shipping. Over all it takes alot of will power to go without food for a week after years on a SAD diet. I recommend doing a vegan diet and limit calories before starting this cleanse to prepair your body for 5 days without food.
3,Hard,I'm sure this product works just fine...if you can do it. I made it a full day and then quit. It is VERY HARD.
2,not for me,"I have been on fast-cleanses in the past and have even done the master cleanse for 21days. This product was absolutely not for me. I was incredibly nauseous, lightheaded and drained after 1 day, I had to break the fast just 2.5 days into it because of my adverse reaction to whatever is in one or some of the supplements. This may work for others but unfortunately didn't for me"
1,Never Again,"I eat a lot. Had I realized just how strict this program was about fasting I would not have bought it. I was irritable, nauseated, and completely drained of all energy midway through. I had to stop and never really felt any of the positive effects that I was supposed to see."
3,Caution,"I am currently looking to buy a new shaker, and just saw this... Take the following with a grain of salt as I have not tested this (and will not be) product, but I felt the need to give caution to others that might be considering it.I am a biomedical engineer at a medical supply company in Ohio where we work almost exclusively with plastics. There is one thing that makes acrylic one of the specific materials that we can not use however, and that is that alcohol degrades acrylic. High concentration alcohol (99%+ isopropyl) will weaken a fresh, uncoated 1/16"" acrylic plate to the point of being so soft you can crumble it in your hands within 30 to 60 seconds. I have never researched the impacts of ethanol (drinking alcohol) on acrylic, but I would expect a similar outcome given time and use.4-star rating is to attempt to not skew review values, as this is what the only other current review was at the time of writing this. This score does not represent any actual rating."
3,"Eh, its Okay","I have the new LG Shine and got a few scratches on the surface. I went looking on the net to see who recommended what to get rid of scratches, and a few websites recommended IceCreme. I bought it and gave it a try.Long story short, if you want to put a lot of elbow grease into it, give this stuff a shot. But the scratches on my phone still remained after twenty minutes of buffing. I tried it on my ipod and the stuff made a more significant difference on that as opposed to my phone - it made the scratches less apartment, but they didn't miraculously go away. All-in-all it requires a lot of work for a minimal amount of improvement"
2,Sad excuse for a microwave.,"I actually have the 8992sb model, but they appear to be exactly the same. It works, but it doesn't seem to have the capability to allow the user to punch in a cooktime. Each number pushed gives you that many minutes, not seconds. For example, push the 2 and the unit automatically starts, giving 2 minutes of cooktime. It also has a 30 second button. But I frequently want 15 seconds. Or 8. Or 45. Apparently there's no way to do that. Extremely frustrating to have to put in more time, then stand and watch to be able to stop it before it incinerates your food. Definitely look elsewhere."
4,"Bette Davis at her wretched, haggard, best!","Hunker down for a night of B&W suspense/psychodrama with outstanding acting like they can't do today. A twist at the end that you won't expect. How anyone can come away calling this a ""black comedy"" is beside me. In my book it rates up there with the great ones of the genre, including ""Psycho"" (the original, of course)."
3,Disappointing for a 50th Anniversary Edition!,"This is just a re-release of the 2006 double disc product, except the sleeve graphics are changed. If you're looking for more Baby Jane content, it's not here! I was so hoping for more interviews or commentaries, out-takes, script re-writes, production stills, etc. Why WB won't get B.D. Hyman involved in a featurette is beyond me. She could probably use the cash."
5,Well worth re-buying this gem !!,"I certainly agree with Brenda Maskunas, the last reviewer, concerning this wonderful re-issue ... As a die-hard Manilow fan, I'm not one to buy and re-buy if I don't need to. But based on Brenda's review, I decided to try this item and what a treat it was!The new cuts which were not on the original issue of this concert was just like having Barry back again in his 30's with the same young voice and style. This concert was MANILOW AT HIS BEST ... young, just starting out, a fresh voice ... the Manilow I got hooked on back in the 70's ...This re-issue is well worth buying again if you are a big Manilow fan from the 70's and miss hearing his younger voice ... I love whatever voice he has, but it sure was good to hear it young again!"
5,Splendid Album--His Best,"This is Barry's best album I've heard. The original album is great, and the special additions are even better. Definately worth the $."
4,"Ordered, received and had it installed in three days","To my surprise, the company I ordered this from is only about 40 miles away. So I order it standard shipping and the next day it is in the mail box?!? The original thermal switch was much lower quality then this one and the wiring was about as short as possible, so I took a little extra time and rewired the who unit and that was 2+ months ago and we have used the fireplace literally everyday since and the switch has performed flawlessly."
1,You have to drill holes in your window ledge.,"This product has a 2 inch ledge. You must drill holes into your window ledge. It is so heavy that I was afraid the wooden window ledge would crack. Not made for windows, any kind."
5,Artistic Anatomy of Animals,"This is a great book for both artists and those interested in animal anatomy. The artwork is wonderful, the text informative and the book easy to use. I recommend this one if you are trying to understand mammalian anatomy or wish to be able to draw anatomy of animals."
2,Stephen King's The Golden Years is absolutely horrendous,"Of the two movies in this set The Langoliers was pretty mediocre but Stephen King's The Golden Years stands out as without doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The plot is that an explosion in a secret laboratory sprays an old guard with unknown chemicals that begin to turn the man younger instead of older. As the government is interested in finding out more about this development, the guard is hunted across the country. The movie was so slow and uneventful that I fast-forwarded the last half hour hoping in vain for something to happen. The movie was so boring that there is no sign that Stephen King was involved in this. Please avoid at all costs unless you want to fall asleep!"
5,Crafty gift,Perfect for my nieces. They enjoyed this project & making something we all will keep around for years to come. A useful & fun gift.
1,Only 1 tension clip per end lets it pop out of socket,"Like other reviewers, the fact that the male ends only have one tension clip (every other plug I own has two) keeps it from staying in the socket securely. I thought Schumaker products were of a little higher quality, but it is made in china :-("
2,Good though not as I expected,"I haven't shot a bow since I was a little kid and simply bought this as a bow that seemed to be all inclusive. It's sitting in the corner until I regain interest. The fishing device isn't as I expected with no way of reeling the line back onto the non-existent spool, I think there are better choices I could've made to get a simple bow to shoot."
3,Not the hottest shipwreck book,"If you are considering reading a shipwreck story from the sailing era, I would not pick this up until you have read Shackleton's ""South"", Philbrick's ""In the Heart of the Sea"", and Taylor's ""Caliban's Shore"". If, after that, you are still hooked on shipwreck stories, consider this one about a Clipper ship which is lost to an accidental fire in the Pacific far off South America. The other books are all better written, provide more historical context (except for ""South""), and are at least as compelling a story as this. That's not to say it is a poor work, but it does read like an academic paper drawn out into book length by spiking the fascinating underlying storyline with speculation about class warfare and other tangents, flashbacks, and asides. All these additions are too clumsily inserted and start to get in the way of the main storyline of leadership and survival which is the primary reason to read, and keep reading, this book."
1,For a hamster,"I bought one for my hamster and no mater how small I made it, she was able to wiggle out. I know it may not be meant for hamsters but it didn't work for mine."
2,no good for ferrets,Its an ugly brown. Its one of those cheap ones thats sold at petco. Dont waste your money it's not even for ferrets
1,"Not good for ferrets, the picture lies.","Despite what the picture shows, this harness is NOT really suitable for ferrets...the neck strap fit alright, though it was a little big. The body strap, however, was far too large.I doubt this would work for a ferret unless yours was the size of a small cat. This is due to ferrets being approximately the same size around their neck and around their armpits, and this harness being made for a creature with much larger armpit circumference than neck.Not only that, but these harness are not made to hold up. The fabric is cheap, so it starts to fray quickly with normal use. The stitching is also lacking. we have owned two now, and they have lasted maybe a few weeks each. I will not buy this again.The SMALL size of this harness could work for baby ferrets, but nothing much older than two or three months.Also, the clasps are completely worthless, you may as well cut those off. The velcro is the only thing that works."
2,Not suitable for guinea pigs,"I bought this for my two guinea pigs, and they absolutely hated it. The fatter of the two managed to wriggle out of it before you could say ""awww"". The second and more cooraperative of the two was not exactly enthusiastic about it. I made several attempts to put the harness on her, and the few times I actually succeeded, she either put her arms in the collar part and pulled it off or just sit there, as the shape did not allow her to move properly. I stopped my attemps and just let her run around without it and in minutes she was back to her bubbly self. :)I think this would be ok for small puppies and kittens, but not guinea pigs (or rats)."
1,GP's hate this,"My pigs hated the harness, it seemed cruel to keep it on. Guinea pigs are fragile, harnesses are meant for larger, stronger animals, not little guinea pigs."
1,Horrible Company,"I wouldn't recommend anyone buy from these folks. 2 weeks after I placed my order I began to wonder why I hadn't got it yet. I sent them an email and they responded with basically ""we ran out"". And I'm like wow... thanks for letting me know. Crappy, crappy, crappy service."
3,Hard to Put On,"I bought a medium size for my 5 month old Mini Lop after reading a couple of reviews. It was waaaay too small (think ""Fat guy in a little shirt"")! I had to return it and got a large instead. The large fits much better and has room for him to grow into it. He doesn't seem to mind the harness once it's on, but putting it on him is such a pain! I can get the velcro parts on but clipping the two clips over the velcro is so hard to do with him trying to get away. I've managed to get it fully on and clipped once out of 5 times so far. I've kind of given up but seeing the picture of the cute guinea pig, I want to try again! Another thing I don't like: You can't pick the color you want. When I ordered a medium I was sent a bright pink and bright green harness when I wanted a blue one. I did, however, get the blue one when I ordered a large. My male bunny is angry enough as it is without making him sport pink and green! :-)"
3,Lead Harness,"I liked it and it was what I expected, but the littlest ferret can wiggle her way out of it with no problem at all and disappear on me. But the oldest ferret seems to stay in it with no problem."
2,Too gritty.,"The coarse grind of this rice flour makes for poor quality, gritty products. It is especially noticeable in cookies, whereas the moisture in cakes and muffins disguise the grit better. Try Authentic Foods super fine ground rice flours, instead."
2,OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!,...I am completely fascinated by faeries. I have been buying books nonstop. I bought this book and was horrified! This is a fascinating book but it is definitely NOT for children. It had one too many sexual themes for me and I would reccommend this book for older faerie lovers
2,It was okay...,"This book is more or less very fluffy and frilly. It had loads of description, but somehow never got the point across. If you read the excerpt, you'll get my meaning. Hard to read if you're not either a college english Professor or a rocket scientist. Not very informative, and hard to look up info. Take my advice and stay away."
2,I do believe in Faeries... but...,"This book did not live up to its potential... sure it told the facts but it lacked in interest and good art. If you want a book that renews/brings the faery faith into you, then I would suggest Good Faeries Bad Faeries by Brian Froud. Now that man knows what he is talking about!"
3,i'm shopping for a replacement...,"I've had this in my salon for 8 months and it's not holding up well. only used for eyebrow waxing, not under duress if you know what i mean? my advice: great price but verrrrry flimsy product."
5,Absolutely First-Rate Adventure Story,"Shark Lake was wonderful. I enjoyed it from cover to cover, and particularly the dry sense of humor that pervades the writing. The story drove on hard and fast, but the characters were surprisingly real and sympathetic, if a little hard-bitten. (Especially one of the women! Tough as gristle!) In terms of the way he expresses himself, author John McKinna is a writer to watch. You can put your tongue in your cheek (where his seems to be most of the time!) and go along for the exciting and often humorous ride. I kid you not: the guy's good. There are two other books in this series (Crash Dive and Tiger Reef, according to Amazon) and one of them, Crash Dive, is about an Arab terrorist attack on a Louisiana oil rig--written in 1999! Talk about predicting the future. I'll be interested to see where McKinna's imagination takes him next."
1,Down load problem,I'm sure you would have more people reading this if it could be down loaded. Could you please fix that problem?
2,Music box a disappointment...,"The concept is a great one, but the length of the melody composed is too short and too choppy. I thought the melody would be similar to that of the Munchkin (Mozart) magic music cube which plays continuously until stopped by the child but after 5 short disjuncted phrases it stops. I found my grandchild 20 months enjoyed the Magic music cube more."
3,Disappointed,"We borrowed the old version of the toy from a neighbor and my daughter (and her parents) liked it so much, we decided to order our own. The new version is not nearly as good as the old. It is more the quality of the sound that bothers me than the lack of cassettes. The sound quality is terrible. Also, I like the Mozart night music but the jazz and African music is not as good in my opinion. I wouldn't have ordered this had I known how different it was from the old version of the toy that we liked so much. The idea of the toy is so fun though. Just wish they could improve the model."
2,waste of money,"This toy doesnt play much of the song, only a few notes. I found it to be pretty well useless"
1,Mary still doesn't get it,"Having read the excerpted first chapter of Mary's book, I was struck by the fact that she still really doesn't understand the problems with the forged documents.In at least three places, she refers to 'peripheral' spacing, when the correct term is of course, 'proportional' spacing.Proportional spacing, or variable spacing between letters, was the obvious downfall of the forged documents. They included proportional spacing virtually identical to that used by Microsoft Word, to the point where one could retype the documents using Word's default settings and create an exact copy.That technology was available to linotype operators but was virtually unheard of on typewriters of the day.For her to misname the feature, 'peripheral' spacing shows that she has never taken the time to read and study her critics complaints.She prefers to live out her days in denial, and wishes to take her readers along with her."
1,"""Truth and Duty"" is an Orwellian Title If Ever There Was One","Mary Mapes, the CBS producer at the center of the forged documents scandal who was fired in disgrace, offers not so much a defense of her actions as a denial of them. Having read the book, one wonders whether the author can actually believe what she has written, since it seems to be contrary to known facts. One will have to await for more honest books for an answer to the question: Was Mapes, Rather, et al so anxious to put on a story that would embaress a sitting President that they so clearly loathed that they ignored the question of the forged documents upon which their story was based? Or did they know that the documents were forged, but put on the story anway?"
3,"Interesting read, but too many excuses","I am a political junkie and I enjoyed the book. Mapes is bitter, and maybe understandably so. The book doesn't do much to shore up her journalistic credentials: instead of saying that she got duped (and she obviously did; I don't believe that she was deliberately lying), her argument seems to be, ""Look at me! I did Abu Ghraib; I can't be wrong!"" She WAS wrong -- maybe not about the substance, but about the documents, and it seems like she's doing a lot of finger-pointing. Unfortunately for her credibility, the finger is never pointed at herself. I think I would have given her five stars if she had just turned that finely-honed harsh light of scrutiny inward."
5,Xmal Deutschland,"I just recently discovered Xmal Deutschland at Robertos club in China Town, (Los Angeles, California). I have yet to find a copy of their 3rd (Viva) & 4th (Dreamhouse) but love the first two. I think they should follow the lead of Bauhaus and have a reunion tour."
3,Make believe it's April in Paris,"This spare travelogue of a story tells of a cat that runs away from her owner during a visit to Paris. The story, though illustrated with beautiful watercolors, begins rather abruptly. It's a little hard at first to recognize that Alice is the name of the cat and not the little girl, who is named Annie.The story gives us a cat's-eye view of Paris, the city of lights. The pictures contain a lot of the usual sites of the city on the Seine, including the ubiquitous Frenchman with long baguettes of bread in the basket of his bike. Since the book is targeted to the non-French, throwing in an illustration of the Eiffel Tower, easily recognizable even to young children, might have been nice.A nice book to read when you want to make believe you are in Paris in April."
5,Reprints the entire highly collectible hard to find Blade Runner isue of cinefex in hardcover form,"For those of you who missed out on the legendary Blade Runner Cinefex issue, here it is in a more permenent hardcover. Contains many behind the scenes color and black and white pictures with tons of information on the making of this classic sci-fi movie from Ridley Scott. Definitely a must have!"
4,Worth the time to listen!,"Give Love (For Christmas) is one of those holiday CDs that you don't want to put away after the season is over. You can find it at [...] and it's a bargain for the enjoyment you get out of it! For those Trans-Siberian Orchestra fans, you know Joe C. well and love his voice and what it brings to any song he sings. This compilation of songs is fresh and original, including some that are vintage that you may have never heard before. Guaranteed to become one of your favorite Christmas CDs!"
4,Gleanings from the Ice Age Man,"Remember the excitement in the early 1990s about the frozen man found in the Alps? The ""Man the the Ice"". He had laid there since the last Ice Age. It was a precious opportunity for scientists to investigate human remains from that period, with clothing and tissue present and amenable to analysis.This book is a partial summary of those efforts. (The third volume.) It actually spans analyses done on corpses found all over the world. These might have been deliberately or accidentally preserved, by various means. Discussions are made about the relative efficacies of those methods, from our standpoint, centuries or millenia hence; in terms of how much has been left for us to study.The motivating event was that Ice Age man. As the book makes clear, from him, we have found much about human life and capabilities in that era."
4,As we read it we believe it really is a true story.,"Three brothers - Jed, 8, Matt, 6 and Andrew, 4 - disappeared. Police investigation report considered they drowned. Fifteen years later, Alex Collier, a TV anchorman, starts his own investigation. The author knows how to immerse us deep in Collier's investigation. And very slowly, we go through every small step he takes. Each page you turn could lead you to a surprise. Dead Silence is, undoubtedly, a great book."
3,Pretty Basic,"I bought this book on the advice of my pediatrician to help my newborn sleep through the night. While it was no miracle-worker, it did give me some basics such as a nightime routine to follow, and what I could actually expect my child to do at his age. I recommend it to someone who has no good ""sleep"" resource, but for seasoned moms, it is probably not any help."
2,"Somewhat helpful, but mostly biased and rigid!","I as well did not find this book very helpful.I am not a mother, but my sister and her family live with us.My sister practices and has practiced co-sleeping with all 5 of her children and they are not whiny, sniveling brats as this book and others against co-sleeping suggest! They are happy, well adjusted children who are confident and secure.And also, to think that the AAP would scare poor first time parents into believing that they could accidentally suffocate their own children is appaling to me! There has never been any scientific proof thus far that this happens, unless the parent is drunk or otherwise impared.My sister has 5 living breathing human beings to attest that this rarely happens.I wish sleep books would give parents this option without presenting it in such a negative fashion.The parents have the right to do what they feel is best for their children without being made to feel guilty for doing it!"
3,Works Good but...,not made for all size bladders. I had to cut and modify to fit both of my camel backs. For the price and a simple mod...I would buy again
5,Great movie,I always felt that honesty is the best policy and his old girlfriend finally learned it the hard way. Taking credit for what someone else did will get you in trouble sometimes when you are caught
3,Not quite in the same league as Elaine Stritch,"This CD is pleasant enough to give you some insight into Bea Arthur without the frankness charm and truthfulness of Elaine Stritch. Neither of them are great singers and both of them have been wonderful in what they accomplished. If you have limited funds or only want one one woman show, I would stick to Elaine Stritch. After you listen to her, you just must love her. Warts and all. And she is not ashamed of those warts."
5,Introduction to Judaism,"This is an excellent resource for those wishing to learn more about Reform Judaism. This book, however does not represent other forms of Judaism."
1,Strong start but a lousy ending,A good main character and concept but let down by it's justification for terrorism and mass murder.Basically 'if a democracy commits acts of wanton slaughter it's OK because it's a worthy cause'.The authors afterward really destroyed any good feeling I had for this book and the only reason I give this one star is that it is the sequel to 'Freehold' a great book about a capitalist anarchic society and a soldier who joins it.Give this a miss if you have any shred of decency.
1,Ayn Rand meets Charles Manson,"The idiocy of the book knows no bounds. First, there's not more plot than needed to him to string together way too many details of training and operations. A military techno dweeb convinced of his own importance.Then he has too strong a Libertarian streak that seems to have given him a lobotomy. To much screaming and preaching about all he thinks is wrong with society -- and that's a lot.He spends a lot of time talking about how religious extremist excuse all their violence because of a belief system in which their just cause says it's ok. Then he rationalizes, both in text and with an apologia appended to the end of the book, all the violence and terrorism of ""his side"". Why? Because the cause was just.He's a bad writer, a fanatic and a hypocrite. A sad excuse for a book and I'll avoid him in the future."
3,"Solid philosophy, little information","As a 30-year playwright and a 20-year playwriting instructor, I can recommend Smiley's text for those interested in the philosophy of script construction, but do not suggest it as a ""how-to"" book. Smiley is poetic, romantic, and writes well, yet assumes the reader already understands basic structure. Not for everyone."
2,Too long - Too hard,The 8 holes on zipper are spaced too far apart for my jungle 8 hole boots. The constuction is indeed strong but it's made of stiff rubber-plastic and does not conform to the tounge of the boot which will cause discomfort on the top of foot. Maybe good for you but Not for me. I returned them for refund.
4,Extended Video Preview,Length:: 4:41 MinsClips from the official The Young Knights webpage: http://www.hymntosurfersmovie.info
5,Review Definitive Anthology of the Easybeats,"This is definitely worth the wait; ordered at the end of May and didn't receive it till the end of June. This is for the Easybeats collector, it's a double CD with almost all their songs, a really nice booklet with info on the band and the songs. Harry Vanda, the lead guitar player, is quoted at length in the booklet and he has liner notes for each of the songs. Really special information for the collector! I'm glad I ordered it."
3,Story holds up,"Tigre's father is hurt. It is to Tigre that the Mayan family must look to take over the father's work. Tigre rises to the occasion and successfully helps the family to put in a good corn crop, though a severe drought threatened the family's crop and their survival. I'm happy to report that, unlike many books published long ago, there was no feeling of judgment in this book, no feeling that the people in the story were savages or ignorant. Instead, the story was told from the point of view of a detached observer. The story holds up. Newbery Honor."
5,Life changing reading,"Like others, this book was recommended to me by a friend. It is one of the most pratical, most amazing directives on living life the way God intended. It is truly life-changing and is a powerful guide in helping one live in freedom and joy despite the turmoils and struggles of everyday life. I am buying several copies to pass along to friends. You will want this book to be your life-long companion."
3,Not great,"I was expecting it to be like the plates, it is cheap plastic. I just someting else to use instead."
5,misunderstanding of description,The unit mailed to me was for tenor sax although this states it is a clarinet ligature. The company was very helpful in the return process. It looked like a great quality product for the tenor sax.
3,Better Horneys....,"Karen Horney's work is essential reading for anyone suffering from an excess of narcissistic pride. This work, though, is a curiosity for those who are familiar with her groundbreaking work, found to much better effect in NEUROSIS AND HUMAN GROWTH among others. Her final lectures give a certain texture to her as a character, and they are poignant as they come at the end of her life. But without already knowing her work, a general reader is likely to give up halfway here, with a shrug."
2,I was disappointed,"When I rented this dvd, I was expecting that the models would start out fully covered and then slowly begin their erotic strp-tease. Most of the models are actualy scantely clad to begin with and there isn't that much for them to take off. The only strip-tease that lived up to my expectations was the two performed by Faith. She, unfortunately, is the only dark haired performer on this dvd.One thing I noticed was that all the models seem to have a bruice in the same place on their left buttucks. I guess they have to be innoculated to work for Peaches & Cream.As for the multi-angle feature, two are from a distance and one is up-close and personal. Unfortunately their are no up close shots of Faith's stocking clad legs."
2,Battery,"Works well, except the phone will go dead just after it shows a charge left; rather a mystery?"
1,or maybe one minus?,"Extremely politically correct to the point of distorting facts. All supposedly information is about 30 years old, everything staged and on top of this comrade Arafat shown as positive figure and the well known facts such as the guy was murderer,criminal,terrorist and pedophile never mentioned.Viva to history channel!"
4,"Heavy, and Heavy Duty","This case seems to be saying ""Go ahead, drop me from an airplane."" If you need super heavy-duty, this could be your case right here. I have not done a hands-on comparison with the nicer pricedPelican 1550 Case with Foamor other brands.PROs:* Super protection- Configurable ""Pluck 'n' Pick"" foam- Large comfy handle- Padlock holes- Many other nice touches - Rubber feet, etc.- Lifetime Warranty- Macho beyond compareOKs:- Two 2-1/2"" storage levels (but no foam layer between storage levels)CONs:* Heavy (14.3 lbs)* Expensive- - - Size Correction - - -Despite Vanguard's printed and Website specs, this case is 21-1/2"" wide NOT 20-1/4"" wide as stated (outside dimension). I guess that's a bonus."
5,Great for camping,This tent is easy to put up and take down. There was plenty of room for five of us. It is well made and stood up to the different weather we had in the mountains. The tent folded into a reasonable size bag. I can't wait to use it again!
4,Good Value,"We like this tent. We camp out just about every other weekend when the weather is good and have been doing so for about 10years now. Along the years we have used different types of tents mostly the ones with fiberglass poles and I can say that this 'rigid-type' pole setup is pretty sturdy and well constructed. The tent is really easy to set up and dismantle, has plenty of room for a family of four and the build quality is pretty good. The place that we live does not see a lot of rainfall so water proofing is not a major issue. However we did notice that on very cold nights with high humidity condensation does tend to form around the seams inside the tent. The anchoring pegs that come with the tent are a bit on the light-duty side but most tents seem to have the same issue; just get some heavy duty pegs and you are ready to go. Though I give this a 4-star rating, I am already considering ordering another set as back-up. That's how much we like this tent."
2,Not one of Morrell's best. Please read his others.,"While David Morrell is one of my favorite authors, I can not in good conscience recommend this particular submission. Blood Oath lacks several things, not the least of which is substance. You can not develop a liking to the whiny, pitiful, under-developed protagonist; Peter Houston. If this is your first read by Morrell, please don't judge him on this work. Try ""The Brotherhood of the Rose"", or "" The Fraternity of the Stone"", or ""The Fifth Profession"" to get a glimpse of what this wonderful author is truly capable of."
2,no dissent allowed,"There is a telling point midway through this film which clearly illustrates this film's way of operating. The late Professor Milton Friedman appears on screen and speaks one sentence conceding a point to the filmmakers but then he is immediately cut off without further comment. Professor Friedman spent his life working as an economist and I would have liked to hear what he had to say regarding the specific issues raised in the film. Is there a way for a film to be partisan without stacking the deck in this way? Professor of Linguistics Noam Chomsky is given lots of time in the film to lecture on economics, a topic on which he is not qualified to speak. A fairer, less slanted film would have let the actual economist have more screen time than the 20 or 30 seconds allowed him.This leads me to wonder why so many Amazon reviewers are satisfied with a film that has such a low regard for it's own audience."
3,"Some interesting revelations, but ultimately doesn't deliver","The film offers a few head-turning pieces of information, but in the end, it simply condemns the modern corporation and all of its greed and psychopathic tendencies without ever coming close to suggesting or advocating for a realistic alternative."
3,"interesting, but I got the point a hour into it...","At 3 hours this is a stretch to watch and sustain my interest. I would have rather watched a more concise 2-hour version of the film. I get the idea - corporations are nasty entities that live for profit. I had hoped that the film would eventually breakaway from the annoying use of interviews where the people stare into the camera. Errol Morris did it to great effect in his last film, but this attempt is a poor-man's version of Morris and his work. The stock footage of garbage heaps and corporate videos was interesting but again, at three hours it became tiresome after the first 120 minutes. Sometimes, less is more."
2,not really in performance,"If you are an obsessive compulsive fan, you will like this item. But its more like a documentary with old film clips. All of the clips are available in better quality thru other dvd's. It's a overpriced for what you get. It should be in a 3.99 bin. It was mediocre at best. It's not really about Paul individually either... It quits after the breakup."
3,It's OK if you only have gluten intolerance,"I enjoyed this book, unfortunately I also have yeast intolerance so lots of these recipes won't work for me. (Yeast intolerant people also cannot have sugar or vinegar.)"
4,Living Gluten-Free for Dummies...my kind of book!,"I actually am no dummy, but sometimes the reading material out there is difficult to understand, and often contradictory. Not so with this book, and the recipes are an added bonus!While I do not have an actual allergy to gluten, I am unable to eat any wheat or corn products, so following this book is about as close as I can get to my recommended eating plan without the worry! It's worth the $$$!"
4,My new food Bible,Very easy to read. Full of factual information and resources. I purchased a copy of this book for a friend that has MS and another copy for an elderly gentleman who was recently diagnosed with celiac disease. Both found helpful information they could use.
1,Seem kind of 1980ish,"I was so surpise to see the copyright date on this DVD was 2005. After falling asleep on the movie three times, I finally made it through the entire film. The special effects look like it was done in the 80's. I mean it is extremely horrible. The acting was horrible. Too much dialogue, weird unbelievable responses, and not enough action. I would say that if you don't have the budget to make a good movie, don't try to and embarass yourself in the process. I wouldn't purchase this movie ever and probably wouldn't even accept it if it was given to me for free! I'm only mad that I wasted 3.99 to rent it..."
1,a very easy review,"This is a very easy review to write. I am watching this movie as I write this, and can review it using only two letters. PU.Cheap special effects (what little special effects there are). A story line that wanders all over the place. Long boring dialogue. Stay away from this stinker."
2,"Umm,Another OUTSIDER protects Us from Evil ET !","Would have preferred the title, INVASION,You guys could have avoided some headaches. C. Thomas Howell steals the film, As he should being it's star. Jake Busey is awesome as a psycho military type. Rhett Giles gave a performance his fans have wanted since day one of his career. Didn't understand having Peter Greene show up at all,and was feeling very cheated by his whole single scene. Almost seems like a Sci-Fi channel buddy flick,Or a modern greek tragedy with alien attack gore.I picked the order of these reviews by box art and the back of box description, Now I'm thrilled it's played out that way"
2,Hg Wells War of the Worlds,"I have recently seen the new Steven Spielberg Movie and have seen the old fifty's War of the Worlds and enjoyed both so I thought I would surely enjoy this one as well. Well I was Wrong. In the movie there are only 2 0r 3 scenes with the alien tripods, and those scenes are very short. The tripods did include heat rays that were similar to the ones from the book and the Steven Spielberg movie put the whole thing looked like a giant crab or spider. and the aliens somewhat reminded me of the movie ""Alien"". I prefer the aliens from the other War of the Worlds movies a lot better, especially the 1953 version. I would only recommend this movie to someone that wants to see all the War of the Worlds movie to compare them (Like me)otherwise I suggest you watch another movie instead."
4,useful practical tips and instructions to improve your videoblogging skills,"yes I agree with the previous review. I found out about many new aspects to videoblogging after reading this book. it was easy to understand and follow and provided useful & relevant examples. I showed my sister who had never videoblogged and now she's started her own too, so I'd recommend this book for anyone who's both new to videoblogging and who has been doing it for a while - there's always something new to learn and try and this book is great for expanding your knowledge and practical skills.thanks"
2,Deserves better sound quality,"I can't believe there are no better source materials for this recording. Audio quality in the late 50's and early 60's was much better than what this release presents. The tinny, over processed fake stereo on this CD is way inferior to the original LP, which I still own."
3,"Good, but the language used is difficult to understand.","It's a good introduction to DWDM technology, but the language used by the autor is dificult to understand, especially for no USA people (that no speak USA english), like me.The autor uses idiom to explain technical issues."
4,My favorite flat iron,"So, this is my favorite flat iron so far.I've used a Maxiglide, Sedu and Chi and have stuck with this....and it's only $30!This iron takes a few minutes to heat up. I have thick curly hair so I set it to 350-400. After using a Maxiglide for over a year I realized that it was frying my hair. I've used this for 6 months along with major conditioning treatments and my hair is nice and strong :)Pros:1. Price2. Works just as well/better than an expensive flat iron3. Soft and Shiny hair!Cons:No ""ready"" indicator light"
4,You need to watch the movie in its entirety,"Those who complained that the movie is in French most likely never finished watching it. Ture there are conversations (<15%) that are in French, Russian or German, but you can simply set the subtitle and audio in English.Excellent spy movie. Very well made."
1,Not for rats,My rat houdini'd out of this in maybe ten minutes. No problem. She tore a big hole through the side. Do not want.
2,Not what I expected,"I thought this witchcraft movie was very boring, most of these series I have seen are pretty good but not this one. Of course I read the review from others before I bought it and should have taken heed to them. I wanted to see this first series because I had never seen it. The only thing I got out of it was how Will Spanner came about. He is the main character in other witchcraft series. I would not had lost much by not seeing this film but I did get to see how it all started."
2,I've Seen Worse!,"To be perfectly honest, THE UNBORN offered a few momentary, jump-up-out-your-seat chills & thrills -- all of the sort you've sat through (and survived) countless times before -- and to far better effect! -- in other vastly superior horror flicks. However, one cannot easily dismiss the pleasure of admiring 70-year-old Jane Alexander's sympathetic performance, or the nail-biting uncertainty that derived from wondering whether Gary Oldman's Yiddish/Hebraic accent was polished enough to weather the storm.Feel free to skip this middling horror flick without any enduring qualms of conscience."
2,Ugh...I've seen better!,This movie to me was so typical and showed no range of acting capabilities. I actually stopped watching after Meagan Good died and wished I could get my money back!
2,"""Only for the faint of heart"" can appreciate....","If you are easily scared then you will like this movie, but if not, then this movie is BUTT. Absolute CACA.Besides not being scary it was actually quite boring. I am glad I did not watch it at the theater or I would have been ticked off.Anyway, the only scene that was pretty cool was the staircase/hallway scene with the demonic old man. That was pretty freaky. Yeah, that was a good scene.So again, for those easily scared you will like this movie, but if not, don't waste your money."
3,i liked it (3.5/5),"maybe it's just me,but i actually enjoyed this movie.it definitely hada creepy vibe going all through it.it builds tension and suspensenicely and maintains an eerie atmosphere throughout.it may not be themost original movie,but i think parts of it were.i also thought theacting was pretty good.there are also some subtle clues in themovie.it's one of the better supernatural thrillers i've seen in thelast while.for me,The Unborn is a 3.5/5"
2,So disappointing...,"This had the potential of being a good horror film, but as is the story with so many movies... the good bits are shown in the trailer! I really was disappointed not to have watched it in the theater b/c my brother was too scared to go! I waited with much anticipation for the dvd, only to settle down and be thoroughly disappointed. It isn't scary at all. Sure, some of the effects are good, but the story is lacking and leaves you wondering why you bagan watching it in the first place. Anyone want to buy my dvd copy? I'll give you a great price!"
1,Do NOT purchase,product did not perform post loadingno response from manufacturermass man product probably made in Indonesiafirst product of many from Amazon that turned out a ghost
5,Very informative,"I've got more experience casting flies to trout in the Rockies, and having moved to Texas, decided to read up on flyfishing for bass. I have read several of the books that are available, and I think this is probably the best one, at least if largemouths in still water are your most likely quarry."
5,Finally - a leadership book you can really use on the job!,"Many leadership books are on the market with excellent concepts and theories, but the great thing about this book is that it contains real tools, assessments, and ideas any manager can download and actually use immediately to assess their own skills or to use as team activities with their employees. This book is great for those who continually work to develop their leadership skills, but is especially excellent for managers who ""don't have time for leadership classes"", because they can use the activities on their own with their team during staff meetings, or as ""just-in-time"" tools as they are needed to help employees deal with change, etc. This is also an excellent resource for those in the HR/leadership development field - the tools can be used on a 1-on-1 basis with a manager, or they could be used within a leadership course."
5,"This book is so MONEY, and you don't even know it - Yet","This book is so MONEY, and you don't even know it! Everyone should buy this book, whether your a dork, a nerd, heck, even a ROUNDER should buy this book. Not only is Jon Favreau the man, but he is also the greatest inspration in my life. ""Swingers: A Screenplay and the Swinger Rules"" teaches the average joe everything from getting the DIGITS to catching a BEAUTIFUL BABY for yourself. Without this book, life is just PUPPY DOGS AND ICE CREAM. This is the one step-self-help guide to getting the BEAUTIFUL BABIES, using your WINGMAN effectively, and learning how to feel the VIBE a PARTY GIRL could be sending you at a PARTY. Although some DIGITS come with BUISNESS CLASS PARTY GIRLS, BUSINESS CLASS always equals BUSINESS A$$. With Favreau's ""Swingers: A Screenplay and the Swinger Rules,"" you will never, ever be SHAQED. I guarentee it. So after you go to AMAZON.COM, and buy the book, you'll be MONEY, and YOU WILL KNOW IT!"
3,A different kind of Danni Leigh,"If you liked those first two cds by Danni Leigh, you may not necessarily like this one. It does not have the same drive that the other records have. That's why I only give this record 3 stars. However, if you like ballads, this one has them, more than the others. At any rate, her great sensuous voice comes across nicely here."
1,"deep, dark hole","I paid ten dollars and change for this book, read it one time, and haven't opened it again in a year. The artwork is revolting -- seemingly the whole point of the book -- and it gave my little sister nightmares, but the actual game mechanics were only marginally useful, and then only if you're willing to tap into your the most depraved, unstable portion of your soul to fully flesh out the character -- and those of us who have jobs and responsibilities don't have that option. If you're a punk rocker and have at least three holes per earlobe or more than one eyebrow pierced, what the heck, go for it. If you have to get up the next morning and look people wearing white shirts in the face, keep to Lasombra and Ventrue."
3,Not like drawing on paper.,Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So I’m short about 19 0r so words for your review.
3,Eh.,"Good tablet for beginners- Not so good otherwise. It's large, and takes up my entire lap. It's difficult to store.The mouse is very useless- You miswell throw it away.Stylus is very good, but I wouldn't suggest playing around with it a lot. It's plastic is kind of flimsy.It's pretty good, generally speaking, although lacks the smooth feel that a good Wacom tablet would have. It's sort of rough feeling.I wouldn't suggest this for anyone who had used tablets before, as it's a slightly irritating system to deal with. For someone getting their first tablet, I do suggest this. It's sturdy, and a trustworthy tablet.You may have to call in to Tech Support to get the right driver, if you're running Vista. The driver provided doesn't do as it should, and the proper one can be obtained via tech support.Overall: A decent tablet, and I could probably skip it across a mine field and have it come out alright. The mouse and stylus, though, as sort of crappy.Works decently, although not smooth.Recommended."
5,Better than I was thinjking,"This thing is absolutely amazing!Hooking it up took exactly 1 minute, and within the hour I was creating Illustrator paths that were previously impossible, and the airbrushing you can do with something like Photoshop is off the chart good. If you are thinking of a career that has anyhting to do with computer graphics you'll NEED a tablet, and with this one so much less expensive than the Wacom version, and IMO almost the same quality. You can't go wrong."
3,too early,Too early to know if effective in running moles off. Used a similar product several years ago and it worked
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The only way this item would get rid of moles (or voles) is if you accidentally stabbed the mole while putting the stake in the ground! I purchased one of these, just to test it, several months ago, and although I still saw a mole hole or two in the flower bed, the roses seemed to perk up a bit. Then, in August, I purchased two more for heavily infested areas. The moles have tunneled into the ground right next to the base of this product and tunneled under and completely around it as well. Apparently they enjoy a good massage every day. I am thoroughly disgusted with the three ""mole chasers"" I purchased and if it were within the return period, I would send them back in a heartbeat. My dog does a better job detering the moles by just sitting on their mounds!"
1,Mole chaser,WE bought three and sofar there is no vibration from them. I truly hope when the sun shines more it will activate them. They have been in the ground two months.
2,possibly satisfied,"We think the mole chaser is working. It did not work for 2 weeks after we installed it. I could hear the vibrations, but the mole was still activein our garden. We are not sure the mole chaser worked or if it was chasedout by my digging out his tunnel under my carrots. That is why we delayedsending a review sooner. Also the instructions say to bring it in when it is freezing outside. However, our mole was busy in our garden during the winter past, chewing the roots of our permanent flowers. So I'm not sure it works."
1,WinDVD,I have received WinDVD but this one is only for Dell computers and vers ion is 4. There is no mention of Dell only WinDVD in the advertisement. This is not good for my IBM Thinkpad laptop.
3,Helpful,"This book offers some helpful approaches for what I do for work, however, have not yet had the opportunity to formally present them yet."
3,"Great for parents, but not terribly useful for professionals.","I am a family therapist and was hoping this book might have some new tools to utlize in my work with parents and children.There are some nice ideas but not many that I hadn't already learned in my education and training, so I am somewhat disappointed.That said, this would be a wonderful book for parents in general, just not for my intended use as a professional."
2,At least the chicks are hot.,"This movie is pretty much a remake/homage (or more honestly, ripoff) of John Carpenter's The Fog. A pirate returns from his watery grave to seek vengeance on the descendants of those who wronged him. Like I said, a rip-off of The Fog. The acting and make-up are pretty decent, but the continuity is horrendous. I realize logic isn't something you should expect in a horror movie but the many flaws are clearly due to oversight or inattention or downright laziness. I love b-grade movies but unfortunately this movie doesn't suck enough to qualify. But it isn't good enough to qualify as a decent straight-to-video horror, either. I guess the best compliment I can give it is this: The production quality of Jolly Roger: Massacre at Cutter's Cove makes Bog Creatures look like Legend of Chupacabra."
1,"If You REALLY Like Valby, Skip This Release!","John Valby is a guilty pleasure. He's rude, disgusting and appalling, all of which make him a lot of fun! The sad thing is, this CD is a real letdown to anyone who likes Valby. It was only a matter of time before he skewered Osama Bin Laden, and that part is fun, but the rest of the CD is very weak. Furthermore, Valby really sinks at the end when he tries to be patriotic and SERIOUS. Yikes! Stick with the naughty stuff John. To make matters worse, my copy of this CD featured a manufacturing problem where it was apparently produced track-at-once. What this means is that Valby's performance, which is live, stops jarringly for two seconds between each track, then starts up again, just as jarringly. Where is the quality control at Laugh.Com? As far as Valby's material goes, this is a sub-standard release, and the technical snafu just makes matters worse. Not recommended!"
4,Sturdy headset with clear sound.,"The mike arm swings for use on the right or left side. The headset is light and reproduces conversations well. The complaint I have is that the picture looks, to me, like this is an over-the-ear set, but it's an on-ear set so it doesn't blog out external noises that well. There is no volume controll, so you'll probably want a base set that has volume to use.The cord requires a Sennheiser connector to connect it to a standard phone jack or a mike headset plug."
4,I like it ... even the 90's workout wear!,"This is another ""oldie, but a goodie"" from Leslie. It is brisk, and higher impact than the WATP series. The toning section is intense ( at least for beginners ). I understand why some people were not pleased about this being a 1990 production. This should be stated where it is easily seen, so people know what they are getting. I like the fast pace, the toning, and I get a kick out of seeing the old workout wear. Leslie's newer productions are more professional, and updated.I gave this 4 stars because it lacks any pointers about form. These are important reminders especially for beginners."
3,Disappointed with this one.,"I have 3 other videos by Leslie that I really like, but this one just doesn't measure up. First of all, it is very amateurish compared to later tapes. There are gaps in the music that are distracting. Also in her ""Walk Away"" and ""Express"" videos, there is a friendly back and forth between her and the people exercising with her. In this one, Leslie just talks and talks alone, which is very dull. Another thing: they jog in this one, not just walk, but for some reason, I got more of a workout with her Walk-Away-the-Pounds 3-mile tape, than with this supposedly 4-mile tape. Overall, I wish I'd left this one in the store."
3,do yourself a favor,"If you enjoyed Tellefsen's playing on this CD, do yourself a favor and listen to Henning Kraggerud play Ole Bull on Norwegian Violin Favourites (Naxos). I admit that the CD sounds like something advertised at 3 in the morning on TV, but the selections, production, and playing are sumptuous."
4,Rare Wax - Must Have for Fans of Sinful,"This single is one of the most rare ones in my collection. In all, the single is seven tracks:* Phonkie Melodia (Remix Radio Edit)* Phonkie Melodia (LP Version)* Push Up N Da Wrong 1 (Radio Edit Censored)* Push Up N Da Wrong 1 (LP Uncensored)* Phonkie Melodia (LP Version Instrumental)* Phonkie Melodia (Remix Instrumental)* Push Up N Da Wrong 1 (Instrumental)The beat on the LP version of Phonkie Melodia is completely sick, with an interpretation of ""Night Moves"" by Michael Frank. The lyrics are clever, and the delivery style is a bit like Das Efx. What's great about ""Push Up N Da Wrong 1"" is that one of the verses by Sinful eventually became the hook for ""El Pecador.""Also, keep in mind that the instrumentals include their ad libs. Other songs on the single sample ""Faith"" by Wee Papa Girls, ""Slow Down"" by Brand Nubian, and ""6 Minutes of Pleasure"" by LL Cool J."
5,Very Informative,"After finding out my daughter was diagnosed with Asthma I read this book. It was very informative and it clearly described Asthma. It was very helpful in explaining different treatments, medications, and steps to take to limit Asthma attacks. I have a much better understanding of Asthma and how to control it."
4,Quality Resource,"This game Guide is another quallity production from Prima that we have come to expect from them. I open it always during every mission and when exploring the land of Cantha.I would highly recommend it's purchase. It's assets far outway it failings. That is to say, we cannot judge this guide poorly in the face of the game's rapid development.There have been many Quests and changes added to the game sense this book was released this is how life goes in an MMO. It is to be expected. Where the Books lack newer quest information forums seem to pick up.On a very positve note I found the mission maps easier to read then the ones they first developed for the main game. So that is at least something too.Great BookThanks"
5,Cynthia Hart's Victoriana Calendar 2006,I have been purchasing this particular calendar for about the last ten years and I have always been very pleased with the product.
4,A Great Starter Book,"As the title indicates, this is a great way to get started in self hypnosis. The author writes with great knowledge of the subject and is interested in using hypnosis for the good of his reader. I found it leaving me with a desire to learn more about hypnosis. The only downfall with this book is that it seems to give the reader the routines instead of teaching how to make routines for yourself. Still, I have read it more than once and would highly recommend it to any one who is interested in getting started in self hypnosis. A GREAT book for beginners."
1,This book is terrible!,"I bought this book as an introduction to hypnosis. It was easy to read yet well written. Alas, despite the writing talent possed by the author, it did not in any way shape or form serve its perpose. I was not expecting to be able to hypnotise someone having read just one book but I tried these techniques time and again to no avail. I then bought ""Fun with hypnosis"" and can now hypnotise people at will. Since reading it I have a 100% track record on over 50 people. The book in question though does keep me warm in the winter months though when I burn it page by page."
3,Good first book to read,"I read this as one of my first books on hypnosis and found it to be informative. It offered a basic outline of what to expect and how to use hypnosis in an effective manner. If you are not familiar with hypnosis, this will provide basic information that will be important to building a strong foundation in how you construct your hypnosis sessions. I found it encouraging to the new hypnotist, even reassuring that sessions will be successful. I now have been in practice for over ten years. In my opinion, reading it was time well spent. There certainly are better books out there, but one can gain insight from each one. I liked the author's ability to craft a script for each session, in theory it makes sense. In reality, I rarely used them, but it does give you something to say, until you know what to say."
1,Not that good,"This book did go into great detail and was easy the read, but it didn't work. It shows how to do certern thing, but not many."
5,A Daily Inpsiration,"This book was given to me by my sister/godmother at a time when I truly needed it. The insights and quotations strengthen my resolve every day to be more the wife and mother that I believe God would have me be. It is a resource that you can use every day, as I do, to remind you what a gift you have been granted through your motherhood."
1,They made a mistake promised a replacement. That was in September 2011,"Thriftit is an unreliable company. They made a mistake and I tried and tried to contact them to no avail. When I put a review on here all of a sudden they were very helpful. I was asked to remove my review that they would give me a substitute for the book I originally ordered, That still has not happened and now they act as if they know nothing of the problem.Do not order from them. You can't call them even Amazon does not have phone number and I am left without my book for a Bible study that starts Jan 5."
1,Probably one of the worst moviesI've ever seen,"I very rarely turn off a film. This one I did. Poor acting, poor writing and really just a waste of time."
2,only o.k.,"This is not a c.d. I can listen to over and over--Raul Malo is much better with the 'Mavericks'.-His voice cries out for harmony and other accompaniment--not that memorable, and I didn't think it was well produced."
3,leader of the Beatles,"I have some interest in songwriters, so I found this DVD interesting on how the songs of John Lennon matured during the years he was in the Beatles, making a few movies, and exposed to Bob Dylan and drugs. Heroin makes a good explanation for the break up of the Beatles, as John Lennon became reluctant to take part in anything that did not get him off in a major high. Something about John Lennon being shot still tells me more than this DVD was willing to try for. Tom Paxton wrote a song, ""Crazy John"" as if ""Where you gonna run to today?"" and ""I want to be crazy, too"" were more natural reactions than a lifetime studying popular music."
2,better to read oracle doc on RAC,"This book is really not special. Why the author still try to cover so many topics that are not really related to RAC? I'm thinking that oracle documentation is better to read, beside it's free.If you have already familiar with oracle architecture, and have some exposure to RAC env, you will feel dissatisfied buying this book."
2,Not much RAC in this book,"This book is somewhat of a misnomer. First it says it includes Oracle10g, yet there is none to be found. Moreover, at least one-thord of the book is basic Oracle and has NOTHING to do with Real Application Clusters. For example there are 10+ pages dedicated to STATSPACK, a non-RAC utility.I think if the non-clusters information was removed this would be a 150 page book. I feel somewhat mis-lead by the title, and the material is not worth the price."
1,Product delivered doesn't look like picture,"The shoes that arrived are of decent quality, as far as I can tell, but they don't look like the picture. What I liked about the picture is they didn't look like typical clown shoes, but what arived did. Fat and with red stars on them.Disappointed."
3,OK,"Have not yet finished it but seems a bit dry, may get into it later. it was required reading for a class."
3,Overpriced,"Even though it looks good and sturdy, my opinion it is overpriced. I thought I'm supposed to get a pair (i.e. front and back) for that price but I've found only one shipped to me for $27. There are a bunch of other plate frame manufacturers for just a fraction of the price Weathertech wants for their product. So am sending it back to seller. I wouldn't recommend buying it for at least this price."
1,Total garbage!,"Some of them were broken, the ones that weren't were just garbage. Doesn't hold the DVD's in place, when you open the case they fall to the ground. Will not be buying again!"
3,compromiesd during shipment,10 of the cases arrived broken. The spindle was cracked and plastic torn; looked like this had happened during shipment. Otherwise happy with product.
1,Price = Quality,"Like most things price does equal quality to some extent. These are no different. FAR cheaper in quality than those you would receive with a retail purchase, these are pretty fragile. The first I removed from the box broke when I tried to open it, second one tore along the fold seam. Pretty crappy. I decide to just keep them to store backup dvds. I would NOT recommend them for any other use."
1,DVD cases,"I debated on buying these DVD cases (Vact 7mm Slim DVD Cases 100-pack) wondering if they would be too flimsy. You definitely get what you pay for because they are awful. They are very thin and when trying to simply place DVDs in the first few cases, 3 of them broke while just trying to open them. They will do in a pinch, but I would NEVER recommend them or buy them again myself."
1,Vact 7mm slim casess,Half these cases came cracked from poor shipping and crack very easily when closing. Recomend the 14mm cases but don't know if they are made in a slim style. 14mm is the thickness of the plastic and they come out much better in shipping and use without damage.
4,Great Deal!!!,"The product is grea and since they have the clear plastic window on them, I'm able to make my own cover for my movies."
2,Cheaply Made Case,"The case is not near the quality I desired. In the past, I've used the Verbatim cases and was pleased with their quality, but Sam's Club stopped selling them so I decided to check Amazon for a replacement. Amazon had the Verbatims, but Since Amazon's price for these cases was very attractive, I decided to try them. I wish I had spent the extra for the Verbatim cases. I suppose one gets what one pays for, and if you go with the ""cheap"" product, you should not be surprised with what you get. They are usable, but on the ""flimsy"" side and not too durable."
2,Not such a good deal!,"As I opened this box of video cases I was met with a terrible smell. The recycled plastic used was not only stinky, but as I opened the cases up fully and set them out to hopefully air out, I found that if I opened them too widely, the cover joint would begin to tear. The plastic is not very flexible, and after 5 days of sitting out, my office smelled awful and the cases didn't seem any less stinky. If you don't mind the smell, and are careful with them, these DVD cases are a pretty good deal, but I wish now I would have paid a few bucks more and got a better product."
4,Best for everywhere EXCEPT for feet,"I'm not sure what it is about this particular formula that makes it especially meant for feet. I have rough, cracked and calloused feet that need a LOT more than what this lotion provides; I might as well have used plain water. The description claims that it is an AHA product, but there aren't any ingredients in it that are active as AHAs. OTOH, it's a very good, fragrance-free hand/body lotion and I've used it that way through several tubes. Eucerin has at least half a dozen other moisturizers, both in a creamy formula and in an ointment formula (under their Aquafor label) that work much better on calloused, cracked feet than this one does."
5,Miracle in a tube!,"I read about this product in a magazine but could not locate in any store. Lo and behold - it's available on Amazon. com and it works wonders! I put some on either at night or during the day under footies and in 7-10 days, my heels were completely soft as if I had just had a great pedicure. I've already told friends about this product. I'll be coming back for more."
2,therapeutic for author only,"I'm guessing that writing this book was quite therapeutic for Ms Stark; marrying a military guy must have been hard. I found it full of personal info, but short on real-world application. I would not recommend this book for anyone looking for real advice, but only as a semi-entertaining story of one woman's trial thru her early days of marriage (with tidbits thrown in from her friends' lives). And maybe that's all its meant to be, but the flavor is laced with resentment--which is not that funny."
3,Wasn't for me...,I thought this would be a fun book to read... give me some tips and find out things I didn't know... but it wasn't for me.I tried to read it several times but couldn't stay interested.I sent the book back.
1,Boring and Longwinded,"I bought this book a few months before my wedding. I started reading it right away, took it on the honeymoon to read on the plane and by the beach, and continued it after the wedding. My husband and I have been married for over 7 months, and I'm just now finishing this book. It was VERY boring.I felt that the main purpose of this book was for the author to tell us her story of marriage. She also throws in an anecdote here and there from couples that she interviewed, but it's mostly about her and her husband.Also, she lists MANY problems you may encounter or feel as a newlywed, but gives absolutely NO advice about what to do to alleviate these problems.Take my advice (I am an avid reader), and pass this one up. There are other books on the topic that I'm sure are more interesting and helpful."
3,"Good insights, but I was hoping for great....","Peppered with anecdotes which detail the Author's personal transition to a married life, this book is not for everyone. Although Stark offers many good insights, she is a freelance writer- not a relationship counselor or psychologist. If you are seriously soul searching and looking for something 'meaty', look elsewhere."
1,La normal,"I'm sorry but I can't praise this. Andy and Lucas sound like every other spanish pop group. I know I'm going to get bashed for this but I live in Spain and I'm sick of everything sounding the same. This is bog-standard stuff. Don't let the other reviews fool you into thinking this has flamenco elements. It does not. And by the way, they are two of the most ugliest pop stars I have ever seen. Almost as bad as Marc Athony. Buy it if you like boyband(lots of sappy love songs) pop at its most potent. Lo siento tios, pero es la verdad."
5,Every piece he writes has sense and meaning,"It is a pleasure to read Orwell. I think that there are two major reasons for this. Stylistically he an exceptionally clear writer. His work has a quiet elegance. Secondly, he is a writer who says meaningful things. Whatever subject he writes about he writes about not only with knowledge but with real ' sense'.In this third volume of his collected essays, jouralisms, and letters there are a number of outstanding longer pieces, including those on 'The English People' 'Notes on Nationalism' and 'Anti- Semitism'He is an excellent letter writer and I especially enjoyed his insights into literature. His remarks on Conrad and Koestler and European as opposed to British Literature are sensible and insightful.All through this work there are scattered gems of humane perception."
4,Good book...BUT,"I have no idea who edits these books but they suck at it. I'm not going to give it 3 stars for editing because it really was a great story, as were all the Misfit stories. But I think Ms. Jerigan should read all of them and see all the problems. It would save on a lot of stars for the story itself.The editor should be fired.And, why does one reviewer have 3 reviews? I thought you were aloud 1 review per book?????"
3,A bit too sweet,"I love hot cocoa in winter. I made it according to directions with milk and it was a bit too sweet for me. If I only use half the cocoa called for, it tastes much better. Has a rich chocolate-y taste. It does dissolve better that some of the mixes that leave you with huge clumps in the bottom of the mug. Only a trace of chocolate there."
3,Love Ghirardelli but--,I really love this brand but this mix HAD to be used with milk to taste good. It could be used with water but the taste was not very good. The Ghirardelli packets are great with water but somehow this type packaging does not measure up. Sorry.
1,WHERES MY TIGER?,WELL I REALLY NEVER RECEIVED MY TIGRESS SO I CANT REVIEW IT I GOT AN E MAIL SAYING IT WAS DEFECTIVE SO THEY WOULD REIMBURSE ME BUT NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT I DONT THINK I GOT THAT MONEY BACK TOO BAD I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING THIS
4,Quilty printing,"The adaptability is low- as in you are on your own when adjusting levels.. The quality as a book is great, art, paper quality and the convenience of having all the adventures in one place. A lot of character back ground is helpful too."
1,Didn't work for me,"Unfortunately, this is my first negative review out of too many good ones to count. Maybe I didn't read carefully enough before making the purchase but in order fo this to work you need to have the right door. I will describe as best as possible, but basically the door and the entry to need to align perfectly to give the two pieces that make up this product a chance to meet and sound off. Second, when I sounded the on switch the device just kept ringing regardless if the second piece was beside the main unit or not. I am not afraid to say this might be my human error, but with that said the device was advertised to be a lot simplier than what I experienced and I am the most electonic/tech savvy person I know so this item had to go back:("
2,Disappointing,"The Elizabeth Lowell books I have read have been wonderful--until this one. The characters were so shallow and unbelievable--and an unpleasant hero! I'm glad this was not the first one of her books I'd read, or I would have missed the great ones!"
3,Uhm............what exactly happened?????,"This was a good book....I think. Characters were great, plot was great, blah blah blah. But the ending...just made no sense at all and was a letdown because after a great novel...it just didn't make sense. Anyone mind e-mailing me and explaining to me exactly WHAT happened at the end here?Decent, if forgettable novel, but the ending just loses it for me...and not only that, but leaves me horribly confused..."
3,I HAVE COME FOR WHAT IS OWED TO ME!,"This is good stuff. Much of the statistical data is difficult for me to interpret. I have not hit the big wampum but have come dangerously close. IT PRINTS MY WAGERS ON THE BET SLIPS; THANK YOU! An autoupdate feature is a must. Most effective when used in conjunction with player savy. Do not rely on software, else you will become a slave to the software. Best results in pick 3,4,5 and Keno. Megamillions and Powerball are the devil; rely more on the data to pick your own numbers for these games. THESE LOTTERY CARTELS OWE US! LottoPro is an effective tool.."
1,Cheaply made and overpriced,"The pejorative term ""Made in China"" doesn't apply to everything made in china, but it does apply to this item. We bought one several years ago, and although the design is very neat (we got many compliments from visitors to our home who saw this wall clock), it wasn't very long before the hands of the clock began to either get stuck or become loose and fall the to the bottom. So, we decided to replace it reluctantly because of the high price. The new one didn't work from the get go. The hands were loose and it is difficult to insert the single battery. Thank goodness Amazon.com has such a generous return policy because we promptly returned it. This is one of the cheapest made products I've ever seen, which is too bad considering its attractive, albeit, simple design. Even if it did work properly, the price should only be $9.95."
2,dont waste the cash,Looks really cool and different for about two weeks then the clock part falls off the wall cause the sticky stuff isnt sticky anymore. Then the minute hand bends a little and catches on the hour hand. I would not buy this clock.
2,Mediocre,The bag is smaller than ideal. I bought two bags and the draw strings on both of them broke within a month of use.
4,GOOD TO GO,They came in with the mail today and appear well made for the amount of money spent on them. We'll see how well they stand up to the laundry system out here.
2,Spine or spline??????,"I've bought several rod building books so far. They all seem to put gtreat emphasis on locating the Spine of the rod. They all tell you how to find itwith a weight, but they don't tell you once you found if the spine is up or down. Nor do they tell you whether the line eyelets go on top or the bottom. One even said the latest fad is to have the eyelets spiral around the rod from handle to the tip. I wish I knew where it is."
2,Not cream of the crop!!!,"After reading the reviews and buying this book I was not impressed. I am a begining builder and some of the info is very very vague, esp on the spine of the rod, most other info I have read on the subject gets right to the point and lets you know where to install the guides, this book is not written for the begginer it is written for the experienced builder, it would have been a great book if I had have built a few rods, I don't even like the guys writing style he is irritating. not a pleasant read, also I am building a rod that I want to look and work for me not for the guy writting this book, if I had looked at this book before I purchased it I would not have bought this book a waste of time and not alot of money!! A must miss, and legend that will last a lunch time."
5,Good How to Book,This is a good beginners book covering the many facets of rod building and repair. The graphics are well done. The book is written by a hobbiest not a professional writer but the book is so well done it is not evident.
1,Great View Horrible Play,"I played this game a few time and gave up. I have recently sold it on ebay. It is so difficult to switch between players that you can not be in control of your play. You are at the mercy of the computer most the time. Example: If you are a defender chasing a faster player usually you would simply switch to one of your defenders up field, but with this game you can only switch to the player that is closest to the ball; regardless of anything else. So, if the computer does not put one of your other defenders in front of the attacking player you are toast. Then, all you can do is hope your keeper, who is almost always controlled by the computer, can stop the shot.I am a huge fan of FIFA Soccer games and I have played them since the early 1990's. This is my first bad experience with a FIFA Soccer game, but it was so bad that I simply refuse to continue playing it. I can only hope that EA Sports will come out with a better version next year."
1,Guide??? Riiight,"I admit, I havent baught a game guide in a looooong time...So maybe things have changed. But when I buy a guide I want full details of ""ALL"" encounters, ""ALL"" abilities, ""ALL"" everything there is to the game.. This... ""guide"" brought me nothing that I could not have easily found on my own.. half of the info is not complete. IE. ((Bestiary, alchemy list, maps, events)) Events!? there is no important info for where to go next, for whos going to be faught when you get there or any decent form of strategy for said foes, there isnt even any mention that a boss is there...The only redeeming qualities of the book are the tear out map, (also incomplete but very useful none the less) and the items list.Overall I am very dissapointed and will never buy a Brady brand book agin... well... maybe 1 more just to say I gave them a chance."
1,Possibly the worst Brady Games Guide ever.,"I am a big fan of strategy guides for the simple fact that I enjoy playing a game one time through and getting the most out of it, replay generally means nothing to me. This guide doesn't give any strategy to enemy/boss battles. Even in the bestiary some of the bosses aren't listed in order not to spoil the story. The maps are decent and will provide chest location but will not actually tell you what is in the chest, it's up to you to figure out. Some detail is given to how to distribute skill points. I can see where the authors of this guide were going, but as a strategy guide it fails horribly. Perhaps they should have looked towards the Shadow of the Colossus guide for direction; that guide is able to balance simple direction and full disclosure. I highly recommend not to spend your money on this guide, instead use the Internet to search for a proper strategy guide."
2,Brady's new low,"This guide is seriously lacking, on top of that a LOT of information in the guide is incorrect. If you feel as though you need to but a guide for this game I would check out a Prima guide or some other guide. I bought this guide when the game first came out, if only I knew then what I know now."
1,Severely Lacking,"I understand that many strategy guides prefer to tread the ""anti-spoiler road,"" and let you figure some things out on your own. But what some authors fail to understand is that many folks who buy these guides WANT to be walked through the game. And that's precisely what's MISSING in this guide.The authors were so careful in not revealing ""too much"" that they inevitably left too much, out. It does give exhaustive information on usual things you might expect such as, item locations, extras, mini games, side missions, boss and enemy locations, maps, etc.Bottom line, if you're the kind of gamer that prefers to be kept in the dark, then buy this guide. But if you're looking for a guide that will actually guide you on ""what to do next,"" then look elsewhere. For Shame, Brady Games ... for shame..."
5,Bible for a first time pregnancy,"I had three best selling pregnancy books and this one stood above the others!! I refered to it more than the others due to the content being more ""facts"" rather than the ""stories"". Any Mom may have her own way of doing things but there are basics that you just can't expect to know based on instinct and this book spells them out in easy to read sections that are well labeled for reference. It's the best and most thorough! A MUST!"
1,NOT WORTH IT,"This is worth ~12 cents but sells for $12.If a tool really improves my work or solves a problem, I'm willing to pay a premium. so I ordered it.This plate doesn't solve the problems of using a SC-29 with stroboframe brackets and later I will upload photos to show the details :1) The screw of the stroboframe is so long, I need two extra washers to make it fit into the short thread of the SC-29. This bracket is so thin, it doesn't solve this issue2) The SC-29's external FP input jacks collide with this bracket and make it impossible to mount3) The bracket is at a 90 degree angle compared to the original foot. The original setup allow to rotate the flash from -90(left) to +90(right) degree. With this bracket it goes from 0(straight forward) to 180degree (straight back)."
3,"It's good, but not for me","Don't judge this scent when you first spray it on. When first sprayed it is very synthetic smelling. After an hour it turns into a very basic soft white floral. Nothing original at all. I added a lippie for great lasting power.UPDATE: After 'marinating' on my skin for well over a hour and a half, Island's tropical florals started to come out and I could really envision an island with clear aquamarine water and a salty breeze blowing. Not one I will repurchase, but nice for wearing to bed I think."
2,Devries/Kors purchase,I think the perfume is old since the smell is somewhat like alcohol. I've used the producut in the past from retail stores so I know what it should have smelled like. I would not buy perfume on line again.
1,Awful Book,"I don't know what kind of servers Mr. Woods designed, but this book was no help whatsoever."
1,Faulty Product,"This product is not really an MP3 player, its an SM3 player. The program that comes with it can only convert songs into 98kbs SM3 format which stinks. Cant try puting an Mp3 on the card because the Rush only looks for SM3 encoded files, not mp3's. The drivers also do not support XP. Grrr..."
2,A new age book,"The fundamental weakness of this book is that the probabilities of his code matrices are not given, so there is no way of knowing if the codes are random. All of the codes in this book use single words or numbers. Skeptics such as Brendan McKay have shown that simple codes can occur in any book of this length. Some codes that I believe are genuine form sentences and the probabilities are beyond chance. A good site for those interested in code research is biblecodedigest.com"
4,Don't pass this book by,"i have used this book over the last ten years with an Edleman review book to pass the ARDMS Registries. You must have another source inconjuction with A&L. However, no other book I have come across gives you so many Q&A. I have passed my physics, ob/gyn and abdominal ARDMS tests using this book and Edelman. I am currently studying for the Vascular exam...again no other book gives you so many questions as well as explanations for each answer. Yes there are obvious typo errors,but don't let that dissuade you from this very valuable learning tool. Couldn't have passed without it. My technique is to read Edelman first then when I have a good understanding I go to A&L read, do questions until i can answer 90% correctly which is not so bad because of the answer explanations), then I am ready for ardms. It has worked everytime. There are hundreds of questions in the A&L for each section. ARDMS only has like 150 question (give or take). You do the math how can you fail?"
5,Huge tent!,"This tent is huge. It is a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be. Which is probably good because we want a couple more kids. My husband was pretty excited to be able to stand up in the tent! He's 6ft 2in. Over all we like it and plan to use it a lot! In fact we are going camping this weekend! The only thing is when I read 'dome' in the title I didn't realize that it seriously meant a circle! I thought from the photo it was an oblong tent, but it is round with 3 doors."
3,Wenger Adler Tent,Pros : Exellent tent for family of five.Cons :1. If roof is little wrinkly you can get sprinkling of rain inside. 2. Front entry roof could be more bigger or small additional room would be great there.
5,Don't Believe the Idiots,"I was fortunate enough to catch a viewing of this DVD several months ago and it is superb. It shows a side of Oasis that the fans don't get to see and after looking at some of the comments and ratings for the DVD, the fans probably don't deserve to see this side of Oasis. For years the media has portrayed these guys as drunks, idiots, rude, etc...with this release we get to see Oasis as human beings. Instead of just getting snippets of an interview in which Liam Gallagher tells a reporter that he is going to go ""kick someone in the n*$%"" in order to get some attention, we get the whole picture and see the sarcasm in Liam's gestures and get a feel for the annoyance of being asked the same stupid repetitive questions for the past 13 years. I thank Oasis for sharing their lives on the road with us and to those who are criticizing this DVd for whatever reason, either get on the bus or go *%^# yourself in the bushes.Cheers!"
1,Not impressed,"I know this thing wasn't much money, but it's pretty much useless. It basically makes the level more bulky. Not much engineering thought went into the design."
1,unknown factors in review,The book provides numerous structural formula in metric format only. there is a conversion chart that shows up at the end. Nowhere in the description of the book does it state the formula applications are for SI units ONLY.
3,Don't buy the Kindle Vers. Hard to read,"I will never again buy technical books in the kindle version, particlarly old scanned ones like this one. It is hard to make out the symbols and variable. You cannot distinguish between characters.The content is very good just unusable with the Kindle."
3,Alright,It was a helpful review. That is about all. I would not recommend it for a beginner. It is a bit fast paced.
3,I'm losing faith in this author.,"Ok, I decided to purchase this DVD since I enjoyed a previous DVD by the same author...Unfortunately, I'm losing faith in this authors instructional experience/ability.Every new concept should start with the basics of that concept and work slowly into the advanced stages...The author didn't do that in this case, and he relies too much on the audience having ""previous"" experience...The author also seemingly becomes confused/distracted too easily by what he is doing, or is intending to do...If you are completely unfamiliar with Trig or Pre-Calc then I suggest you not start with this DVD. If you have some past experience you may be able to ""muddle"" through along with the author...MJL"
2,An okay basic review,"Id recommend this DVD for someone who has taken pre-cal and needs a little brush up on some basics. I didn't find this DVD to be very in-depth at all, and not suited for what I was looking for. I tried to use this DVD in conjuction with my class and it really didn't cut it. I would recommend the Teaching Company's High School Algebra II for those about to take or who are taking pre-cal."
4,I'm Full Now,"Over 30 tracks spanning 30 years, this Album's got a great mix of theMTB's work. I had a hunger for some Marshall Tucker Band after hearing Can't You See, I'm Full now, but I'll throw down again tomorrow! I'm a younger guy, with less to reference from but this album keeps me rockin and I got it for way less than an album goes for on itunes!"
5,Marshall Tucker Band-Anthology: The First 30 Years,"This double CD is filled with hits from one end to the other. I enjoyed it completely, as it contained all my favorites, and then some. It was definitely a bargain, and if you like MTB, I highly recommend this CD."
3,THIS is the real apologetic work to read!,"While I do not agree with this book's arguments or conclusions (or its ""atheist"" main character who believes in God) this is a really good book.It is very short, and sums up the reasoning and thinking of most devout Christians. You won't find technical or philosophical arguments here. But if you read this and have had experience debating Christians, you will have deja vu!This book was essential for me in understanding the Christian psyche. Recommended."
4,Great nice looking anti-theft device,"I have 2 older version AutoLock X and works great on my cars.Ordered this one for my sister but it doesn't fit my sister's 2007 Audi A4 Diesel Wagon even though the product said it fits 2007 Audi A4 but not the previous model years. My sister sold this to her friend.So be careful, make sure it fits your car before order it."
3,Book Review,"Only the first chapter seemed to be useful. The book is very dated - all data seems to have been collected in the 70's, thus it's written from that era, even though it has been updated. Even though the book is very liberal and much of it doesn't seem to apply to todays young gay person, if you wade through the 'muck' there is still some useful info and I would still recommend it."
5,Good for groups or individual learning.,"This product comes with a booklet full of fun activities to do with your toddler to help them learn the alphabet. I've used many of their suggested games, and the children have enjoyed them all. It isn't the most requested alphabet game that I have in my preschool, but never fails to entertain the group when I pull it out. I'm pretty picky about what I use to teach, and I'd prefer that the letters weren't crooked and that a more basic font was used, but that doesn't bother the children at all. They seem attracted to the bright colors and they don't seem to have too much difficulty identifying the letters."
3,Okay,This is more suited to rodents. I have a cockatiel and he freaked out when I put him in here. I wouldn't recommend this for traveling for over 20min.
3,very small not good quality,I oringaly bought this for my peet chinchilla as a travel cage but it was much much smaller than i thought it would be. It would wourk great with gerbils and hamsters though.*edit. i forgot to mention it is a very poor quality cage. when my pet was in it i was worried bout the bottom falling off/out. i have long since replaced it.
5,Really nice set of flatware,"Replaced an aging set of flimsy flatware and was really impressed with the heft and look of this set, particularly for the price I paid (which naturally may be different than the price currently charged).It arrived promptly and I'd buy another set in a heartbeat."
3,"It was not necessarily not on time, but i wish it could have came faster","I ordered text books for college online and a little late this year, i had a late registration. i currently have three out of the five text books i ordered, this not being one of them, and i start school tom. sooo i just wish it could have came a little faster and just a tad upset."
2,hackneyed plot,"Although well-written, I thought the plotting too contrived and the characters not altogether credible - too monochromatic. The style and setting throughout are determinedly realistic, but, like the plot, the protagonists seem manipulated into doing what the author decides is best for them. Unfortunately, much in the story came over as padding. For instance, why the constant allusion to the fires, why the rain which in any event did not douse them? Neither served any purpose. In fact, I found little of real substance in this novel. And in the end, OK, fine, but what happened to Bull?"
2,A Good Yarn,"This is entertainment! Mr. Baldin names no sources other than a ""document"" he found at a garage sale; the rest is an example of a wild and wonderful imagination. He even gets the location of Area 51 wrong saying it's in Arizona. Actually, I really enjoyed this book, and was able to read it all in one sitting. However, until the author offers better souces for his information, for me, it's all ""PULP FICTION."" After I was done, I threw it in the garbage."
2,Not what I expected,"I suppose my disappointment in this book could lead to the fact that it was publised in the late 1800's. I didn't realize that when I downloaded it. There really aren't 'recipes' in the modern sense, just directions on how to prepare different types of salad. The problem for me was that it's all kinds of salad that I wouldn't like like lamb salad, carrot salad and other strange combos. I suppose back in the day this would have been interesting, but for me it wasn't. However, it was free, so I really can't complain to loudly."
3,Good book for more advanced goldfish lovers.,"This book isnt for the first time goldfish owner, but is good for more advanced owners. It has good pictures and has lots of info on how to start a goldfish pond and also has info on some aquatic plants. I would say it is a pretty useful book to have on goldfish."
3,Ho Hum verses Ho Ho,"I had not read any Hercule Poirot books although I really enjoy the TV series - even in reruns - with David Suchet. I thought the book was quite boring - Interview all suspects; eliminate suspects; pick primary suspects; put all suspects in room, yada, yada, yada....... So my conclusion is that what makes Poirot so.... well.... Poirot is Mr. Suchet and not the mystery itself."
4,Another Classic,Agatha Christie at her best. An intricately constructed story that flows quickly to a surprising ending.You will not be disappointed.
4,A good read,Agatha Christie at her best. Good story and a colorful group of characters.. Any fan of Hercule Poirot will love this book
5,Hercule Poirot`s Christmas (Hercule Poirot Mysteries) by Agatha Christie,Agatha Christie comes thru again with Hercule Poirots little gray cells this book is a must read for Agatha Christie fans!!
1,Made in China,"I bought this deck expecting to use it as a learning tool, larger images make it easier to see the details; I would have also liked to have been able to use them to read with also but they lack the feel, durability and coating of the cards made in Italy. These feel cheap and suitable only for looking at not like a deck to be shuffled. Very disappointing."
5,A worthy tome of mammalian facts,For years I have keep this book close by my side. I'm amazed by the number of times I have consulted it while watching a nature show or after a discussion of wildlife. The coverage of mammalian families is comprehensive and the photographs are beautiful. A must own for any naturalist
3,check the copyright date,This is an excellent source but one must be accurate about the copyright date. This book has been reprinted several times but the date of copyright is 1984. There has been much new information and research that would be available in a more current text.
5,BEAUTIFUL,AAAAAH Beautiful This guy is awesome. He is the first piano player with whom I experienced Debussy's work.I am happy with this cd.
2,too good to be true,"Pet Zone Pop-up Finch Thistle FeederAlthough it looked great, and had easy assembly, it is a lousy design. Everytime it rains, the water gets trapped inside making my thistle food soggy and moldy. Would not recommend buying it."
5,Great Historic Photo Collection of Pan Am's Clippers,"Stan Cohen's book is a wonderful pictorial exploration of the commercial aviation conquest of the Pacific. I found the discussion of the North Haven Expedition and the Pacific Clipper base construction most interesting. Cohen shows pictures of their heyday and as the looked when he researched the book. Cohen also has some photos of the China Clipper I had not seen previously. If you are a Pan Am Clipper history buff - this is a must have book.Jamie Dodson, Author[...]"
5,Love this game!,"A friend bought this game for us to play, and it was a blast! We loved this game so much that I decided to order it for a family game night. We all really enjoyed it. I purchased it a long with the tin, and now we have hours of fun ahead of us!"
3,Fun pastime,"My mother gave me this game for Christmas. She found that the name was perfect for me. Luckily, it was perfect for her, as the box claims, ""even if you're a dumb ass you can win.""Now, on to something more pertinent (and more true).The game is a very, very easy to play trivia game, with smart and exceptionally simple turns.That being said, the game is geared toward culturally or school-savvy persons. Although I do fine, my much smarter mother almost always wins, and the younger family members have no chance. This game would be best played by a group of similar-aged players to level the field.One good aspect of the game is that questions not answered correctly will benefit the reader, so when most players are evenly matched, the game is a little more exciting.A game can take from 15 minutes to 45 minutes, although the latter is unlikely."
3,Just Alright,"This game sounded pretty good. Some questions are difficult. My major complaint is that for the social group that we are while playing it is quiet. You are only to respond when you think you know the answer. Board is quick to go through, but each round is slow because there's not much excitement."
2,Maybe because I don't like trivia...,I did not really enjoy this game...but that might be because I am not into trivia. I would not recommend this game to anyone who likes party games.
2,Decent game with no staying power.,"The game is reasonably fun. The question format is inviting to all skill levels: trivia buffs will enjoy guessing after the 2nd or 3rd clue, while novices should be able to identify the object/person/place after a few more clues.This game has a fundamental shortcoming, however. There simply are not enough cards. After 6 or 7 times playing the game, you have gone through nearly all the cards. Even without memorizing the cards, the experienced player has an advantage, consciously or not. For this reason, the game has little enduring value, and I do not recommend it."
5,Fun game that tests general knowledge!,"This was a fun game to play. Good trivia questions, some of the clues might get a little too obvious at the end, but then some of the others are really hard, so its a good mix. The more players you have, the longer the game lasts. We first played with 3 people and it went real quick, so we played multiple rounds. Then when we had 6 people, it took a good amount of time to complete one round. Its fun and a good deal for the price."
3,Not so much,We really didnt find this game all that amusing. We played it once or twice. The directions are cumbersome however we do use the cards because the questions are pretty good.
3,Only okay.,"I bought this game so we could play it during the holidays. We ended up playing it only once. The ""ass"" part of it wasn't really made very relevant, other than repeating the word occasionally, perhaps for shock value. The trivia questions were okay, but we didn't really like it enough to break it out a second time."
2,"Deceptive description, disappointing film","This film was decent, though overall I found the pace and the way it was edited to be rather tedious. Beware! If you are looking for an actual documentary of the process of Indian film making and film music making, this is NOT going to satisfy you. While this DVD claims to ""take you behind the scenes"", it really is mostly focused on how Bollywood films are superceding older forms of entertainment like theater, and drawn-out critiques on the irony of selling escapist dreams of idealized village life to India's poor. There are a few interviews, but nothing that really shows the amazing scale of film music production or the incredible speed at which the composers and orchestras work. It also fails to explore any of the exciting intersections between Eastern and Western culture occuring in Bollywood music. If you're interested in this aspect I recommend the CDs ""Dance Raja Dance"" and ""Bollywood Funk."" Overall, this DVD was a disappointment."
3,Adequate,"Not heavy, fairly easy to move, but the light it casts has a weird shape. It's not a nice soft all-over glow, but rather bright in some areas and darker in others. Still - it's functional."
5,Comedy at it's best.,"Benny Hill was a wonderful comedy writer and performer.His clown and mime routines are especially outstanding.The supporting cast members are very good and fit right into these skits.There is a lot going on in these programs, watch them multipletimes and you will see and hear things you missed on first viewing.Glad they are available on disc."
4,Keep you laughing for hours!,"This DVD set is a dream come true and a must have! Benny Hill is non stop laughs. Benny takes satire, relevant topics, and cultural themes of his era and combines it with sexual humor. This set covers his career and evolution of his comedy. To anyone who does not know who Benny Hill is, I would say he is a mix of Johnny Carson, Richard Prior, Jim Carey, Adam Sandler, Michael Richards, and Jerry Seinfeld. Benny Hill is the Sean Connery of comedy, others who came after him are good, but there will always be one true original."
4,Great DVDs... astonishing bargain!,"This set contains all the specials Benny did for Thames between 1969 and 1989. It was from this material that the syndicated Benny Hill Shows which ran in the U.S. were compiled. If you purchase this set, you will have the complete, original & unedited source of all the Benny Hill shows - including lots of bits and pieces that never made it across the pond.This ""megaset"" is also a terrific bargain. Buying the volumes individually would cost you over $100 more! I recommend it highly for Benny fans."
1,Arrive Damaged,"Purchased a recently, packaged well, item damaged in a way that could only have happened at the factory and evidenced poor quality processes. Item would not work safely with this condition. Connecting area was chipped preventing a secure attachment. Other than this important issue the item is a good attachment concept so check it carefully before trashing the packaging."
1,Poorly design and built,"This unit not only doesn't not work as stated, in fact mine never worked well out of the box. it will not even mix granulated herbs and spices let alone any difficult task. This a poorly designed and constructed device. Save your money, do not buy."
3,Stick To Google,"This book is a waste. I feel like a child wrote it. It's not what I expected at all. All the lovely ""tips"" are a waste of time. You're better off with Seventeen Magazine's 500 tips book."
4,Neat little read!,"I got this book very fast. It has some very unique and interesting tips. I'm so excited about trying a few of them, especially the ""Cool Whip"" tip."
4,Good information provided,"Very clear. Covers feeding, housing, breeding, and genetics,as well as common diseases and household medicines that can be used to treat various conditions to which canaries are susceptible. However, an owner who does not want to breed might grow tired of the focus on breeding. Also, owners with canaries who were not handfed as babies may assume there is something wrong with their bird because the book discusses relatively tame handfed canaries and neglacts state that their tameness and willingness to be handled is not true of birds who were not hand fed. So be aware that if your bird does not like to be handled, this is normal. In fact, a non hand fed canary who does not struggle when caught may be ill. One final note: Information and medicating are fine, but misdiagnosis can occur,so it is good to also be have the name of a vet."
5,Very well-written and informative,I enjoyed this book. It was detail oriented yet enjoyable. It covers a tremendous amount of territory in a short space.
2,The best study case cd about Zaha Hadid,"This CD, ""Zaha Hadid works,"" from planet architecture is the best cd for study case that i ever viewed. Planet Architecture provided many informations and pictures about the works from Zaha Hadid. They give you more information than the books from the library. In some of their cds, they even have the interview video with the architect. With the new technology, planet architecture let you see the building like you are there. From scale 1 to 5, I gave it a 10."
3,"Ok, but not what's advertised","I received these in the mail in a timely manner, but they did not look like the picture. They still served their purpose, but felt that the picture lied to me. They had green tops."
5,WHAT I 'VE BEEN WAITING FOR,"My friend bought hers directly from David Bisbal's website and lend it to me, but I wanted my own copy, so here I am ""waiting"" to receive mine.I could see this DVD over and over again, and I could hear the CD all day long. This relesase just proves that there's no other Latin male singer better than David Bisbal, he's simply the best."
3,Not Bad Practice if You are Sure of Your Abilities,"The idea of sticking just practice tests into a book is just novel. But buyer beware; you must truly KNOW the information before the practice tests for them to really help you. I bought the book, worked through 3 of 5 tests (5 is a lot of practice tests!) and got a 760. If you are shooting for around that score and only crave some practice for the writing SAT II, this is the book for you. Don't expect to learn anything new. Just expect to drill and kill."
1,Exploding headset,"After operating without a hitch for more than two years, my BW900 suddenly exploded while sitting in the charging station. The headset itself popped out of the charger and was split in two. The culprit was the battery (yes, the original one that came with the headset), which had split open, forcing the headset apart, while apparently expelling enough gasses to eject the whole mess from the charger.There is no way I will ever put a Sennheiser headset on my ear again."
2,Spotty performance - doesn't justify the cost,"This was a huge disappointment. Having gone through about 5 high end bluetooth devices in the past year and not being able to tolerate cramming plastic ear buds into my ear, I had high hopes. I wanted to use this for both voice recognition as well as wireless for my cell and my VOIP phone in my office.It worked great on the office phone and was extremely comfortable. However, there was a problem picking up the line from the handset or speaker phone.On the cell phone it was absolutely useless. Every other word would cut out. No one could understand what I was saying. Just utterly useless. I went back to my jawbone for cell usage.Even bluetooth for PCs for voice recognition was spotty. On my desktop it would not even meet the minimum quality for DNS. However, it worked great on my laptop.Sadly, just spotty all around."
1,This is not a toy.,I am an adult collector of Barbie dolls. They really are not toys for young children. This one does not come with little accessories and basically it is just for display.
3,Low carb marathon - hydration help,"As a low carb runner and marathoner, I was looking for an electrolyte replacement product. Ultima comes recommended from the Grandma's marathon and a few others, so I thought I would try some. The taste takes a bit to get used to drinking. This is not low carb gatorade as the Stevia has a bit of aftertaste. Does it work? I did long runs of over 15 miles with this as my sole source of hydration in the summer heat without problems. If you are looking for other products, Hammer Nutrition sells electrolyte tablets and of course there is always Emergen-C lite packets."
4,National Park Rangers for KEXP,"Lots of very familiar chords, hooks and transitions here - from the 80 and 90s mostly. The David Byrne comparison is obvious, and one reviewer heard Gordon Gano (Violent Femmes). What I hear is more Richard Hell and/or Tom Verlaine - Does anyone else concur? Anyway, on my 100 minute commute to Mount Rainier National Park, this was in my stereo from August till November...lovely, goosepimply music."
3,Read this book...but then...run into a brick wall,"Frankly this is a nice book for beginers as well as a ref. source for experienced data warehouse experts. The book very briefly, avoiding all the boaring and unnecessary details, explains the process for building a data warehouse.But there is something very interesting about this book.... There is no way you can reach the authors of this book if you want some explanation on something written in this book. There is no email address or any other contact detail mentioned anywhere in the book. Also, any attempt to write to the publishers to get some help are totallly futile..they just don't seem to care.This leaves the reader with a far-from-satisfied feeling after reading this book. Nevertheless, I believe the authors have no role to play in in this book providing a not-so-adequate experience.---- One disappointed reader nmcv@hotmail.com"
2,"Constant, cloying, religious gobbledygook","What would otherwise have been a pretty darn creepy movie is ruined almost instantly by the presense of an over-brainwashed, hideously annoying little boy who spends the entire film vomiting forth blase, pathetic, semi-Christian witnessing. There simply is not a scene where he isn't praying, reminding everyone that god is to be served or just generally mewling about his creator.Whatever your view of religion, be it positive or negative, I can't imagine ANYONE could stomach this endless barrage of sickening idolatry. It's like watching a Beatles or Elvis fan prattle on about their favorite singer.Ignoring that, the film is still loaded with re-hashed horror and King stereotypes: creepy little girl, check, ex-alchoholic hero writer, check, drunk old know it all townie, check, corrupt person in power, check... the list goes on and on.It had some good points but I just can't reccommend the thing at all."
5,"Wonderfully written, unique story","Yes, this is one of the best & brainiest children's/young adult's books out there. The main characters are misfits stranded amongst ""normality"" in a boarding school... anyone who has been less than incredibly perfect and popular can relate to the heroine. Gardam has created very unusual, intelligent and deep characters... and she writes with compassion and skill. What begins as a story full of painful non-interaction and isolation moves toward riveting romance and self-discovery and bravery, unveiling the plot with an almost gothic mood. Complex, atmospheric, smart and strong; this is for mature young-readers and for adults who remember their own coming-of-age pangs. One of my most memorable surprise discoveries."
4,"good, not great, but it's still Anita","This wasn't the greatest book in the series but it was still a really good book. This book didn't quite have the same bite, if you will excuse the pun, as the other books did. I just didn't think the action or the jokes were as good, but I still finished it in one sitting. Anita is growing closer to the dead at each step whether she want's to or not, adn this also means she is growing closer to Jean Claude. Dispite all her efforts to get rid of him he moved from monster to someone she cared for. And the saga continues. This book was well written and amusing, and introduces us to an all new ""magical"" group and their slave, Bloody Bone"
2,Forced my self to read it....,"Well, at this point I knew there had to be a flaw to this wonderful series, bloody bones was so boring and so confusing I didn't enjoy it at all, it took me like forever to read it and I had to force myself to finish reading it.For starters, it wasn't very clear who the bad guy in the story is, bloody bones? Serephina? Bouvier? Xavier? Janos? The Feds? Jesus! So many bad guys, the description of how she raises the dead was so freaking long and boring, i think half the book was that scene.The only saving grace was the hot make out scene between Jean claude and Anita, which wasn't so hot anyway. I'm so mad at her, she brings Jean claude into this mess and mistreats him at every chance she gets. Doesn't seem fear to me. Edward and Richard were no where to be seen.So far the worst."
4,Great Urban Fantasy!... at least for the first 6-9 books...,"Anita's back! Unlike book 4, Anita's necromancer skills are once again in demand. They want to raise dead from unmarked graves that contain corpses at least 100 years old. Anita is the only person in the world who might be able to raise that many ancient graves without using human sacrifice.As usual in Anita Blake novels, Anita is also asked to advise on a crime scene. During the investigation, Anita turns to Jean-Claude for information and assistance.Richard is only seen at the very beginning of this book when Anita tells him she has to go out of town for a job. This gives Jean-Claude the opportunity to become a true rival for Anita's affections.Still the same great action-packed story lines as the first 4 books. If you liked the first 4 books, don't stop yet! You'll definitely want to read this one!"
3,Anita Blake book 5,The Anita Blake series is okay. I purchased the sets for books 1-4 and I feel that I need to finish the series. However it seems like the same story line keeps happening over and over.
3,"This is not her most ""characteristic"" Anita Blake.","While I will continue to grab and devour anything byMs. Hamilton and most especially the novels aboutAnita Blake, in this one she has Ms. Blake act hopelessand helpless not one, but three times. This was not her best.I would award that honor to ""Lunatic Cafe."" Can't wait for""Death Dance."""
1,The honeymoon is over !,"Antonio Rocha gets the news from his lawyer that he is the guardian for his dead bro's kid; thus, he hops on the plane to confront Sophie Cunningham, the tramp, who watches over his neice.Antonio and Sophie don't see eye to eye on many matters, and their underlying passion for each other confuses them. She is a virgin, yet Antonio thinks he can bank on their ""arrangement"" to give pleasure on his terms notwithstanding Sophie's needs; indeed, Graham tries to unravel some of their thought processes like why Antonio harbors resentment for his beloved wife and her transgressions as a (...).True Graham fans are in for a disappointment with this book, especailly since many of the twists, setting, and the lines are recycled from other plots. It is sad, but it took me 3 days to finish this novel; I can hardly tell others to put it down; however, you were forwarned that the honeymoon is over even before it began unless the characters can sort out their personal differences!"
5,A good escape,This was a good read! I recommend this read to anyone who like's Lynne Graham's books! The characters meet up with characters from her other books and I like that it's like a continuation almost like a series but not!
1,Not a single mushsroom!,I ordered this as a fun item for my Biology classroom. I followed the directions to the letter. Not a single mushroom has appeared! I bought mushroom kits (not logs) last year and they were a great success. But this one was a complete waste of money. Look elsewhere before you too throw good money away.
4,low price works as well as more expensive item,"The price was good, the vendor was prompt and the item works as it should."
5,Replacement filter for Duracraft Humidifier,"These filters are simple and inexpensive. One lasts a whole winter season, although you may need to replace it once. I use the humidifier in the winter months when the heat dries out the house. It keeps me healthy and comfortable. I have tried almost every portable humidifier out there. Many promise no maintenance and no filter replacement, etc. I keep going back to my Duracraft Evaporative Humidifier which I have had for years. The other humidifiers do not last or the ""permanent filters"" fall apart and are costly to replace. The Duracraft does require regular simple maintenance. I rinse out the tank and filter every time I fill it, rotate the position of the filter, and periodically clean the tank with white vinegar."
4,great voice,great selection of songs - not the run of the mill. Unusual quality to her voice - always a great performance.
3,disappointing book with great art,"Only about 8 festivals are included in this book, both major (Christmas) and minor (Tanabata from Japan) lumped together. Corresponding stories are quite long, sometimes stilted and oftentimes violent, and don't always pair well with their festivals. For example, the Indian festival of Holi appears with a story about Krishna, a Hindu god who has no involvement in the festival of Holi. This book is best for older children (10 and up, I'd say) with a strong interest in a particular festival. If you're looking for a comprehensive book of world festivals, buyChildren Just Like Me: Celebrations!- it's the undisputed monarch in this category.The illustrations are by far the best thing about this book. They're unequivocally gorgeous. Now that I've bought it, I think the best use for this book might be to take it apart and frame a few of the two-page spreads."
3,Seems nice...,"... this is a great book for kids who are doing a project on different kind of festivities or to sit down and talk about cultural things with your kids, however this isn't really an interesting read for the average reader."
4,"Great stuff, but I'm keeping 9 or 10 for REALLY great stuff","The best thing about this book actually, to me, was Kevin's intro pages. He talks about why/when he started writing for movies. Two very good screenplays in one volume. Don't get me wrong, I really liked them, but the fact that they win awards is a testament to the low quality of hollywood movies in general. It's cool, but it's not right that a guy on a shoestring budget with some decent ideas can kick hollywood's a**.The ""latent homosexuality"" motiff in Kevin's work gets a little tiresome. Otherwise, top notch work."
2,Chasing Amy Was Trash,"Although Kevin Smith does have a way with dialogue, I thought Chasing Amy was just plain gross and offensive. Graphic description of sex scenes between two women doesn't interest me. Although I appreciate mature considerations about sex, I find his toilet humor approach to sex much like that of a horny 12 year old who's spying on his sister in the shower. I will never go see any of his films again. And Joey Lauren Adams' screaming approach which she called acting in the movie didn't help much either..."
4,3 years and counting... but time may be running out...,"I purchased this clock about three years ago and it has worked great. Keeps time accurately and is still waterproof after years of regular use. The battery lasted over two years before it needed to be replaced.The only problem I have now is that the little ""pull"" tab on the back of the clock (used to remove the waterproof housing) has broken off. I have only opened the back up for the normal time changes and the one mentioned battery change, which amounts to about 8 times total. The back is now much more difficult to get off. Darn near impossible actually! It is a minor inconvenience, but I was a surprised the tab broke off after relatively little use.Side note: If your shower is near your bed/bedroom and you are a light sleeper or have trouble falling asleep, it might help to know that this clock does tick sort of loudly. It isn't anything that can't be fixed by simply closing the bathroom door, provided you have a door to close of course."
5,Truly useful,"We bought one of these shower clocks more than 3 years ago. It ran with no problems until just this week. When we opened it up to change the battery, we realized that some moisture had finaly leaked in. The battery was corroded and the motor must have burned out. We are replacing it with another because it really helps my son shorten his showers so that he doesn't miss the school bus."
5,Great shower clock,"I've had mine for a few years now (and bought a second for another shower).It works, it ticks, battery lasts perhaps 2 years, and it keeps accurate time.The top of the clock does collect dust (easily rinsable), but the rope appears to be impervious to rot or mildew.Never had any problems with water (but I tend not to bother adjusting it for Daylight Savings, so I don't open the case often)."
2,It changed color; I did not need that!,"Someone gave me a motorcycle chromed highway bar which had a few scratches. I purchased this item to cover the scratches which had now rusted. For the first month, this stripe looked fine: just like the rest of the chromed bar. However, in times it changed color and became an eye sore just like the rust the bars had. Mind you the bars were not near pipes where the heat might have affected it. I think it was either sunlight or chemical reaction to rust. Either way, it does not work for what I needed it. I did not need the chrome guardian stripe to stop looking like chrome!!!"
3,colors are less crisp than other videos,"I do not have a high definition tv - but have a good tv. I like the ""Sierra Nevada Log Cabin Fireplace"" and the ""Virtual Flames"" dvds better than this. This has a nice roaring fire but the colors are dimmer than the other ones."
2,Doesn't cut it,"When I read The Blue Edge of Midnight I thought it was about as strong a first novel as an author could hope to have, except for maybe the few truly genius writers in the genre. I have no idea what happened to King here, but, as other reviewers have stated, this is by the numbers and even then gives little to keep the reader interested. In fact, there is not a single physical confrontation, a single scene of suspense or thrills, only a very weak and ultimately uninteresting mystery.I want to make it clear I am not bashing King. I will read his other books and hope this was an aberration. His prose remains excellent but prose does not equal story. My only saving grace is that instead of buying this I got it at the library."
4,Want to get a better look at this politician ...,"Picked this up months ago and reread upon hearing of Lieberman/Gore ticket! This is a man of substance, character and strong conviction.Thinking of public service? You might find some inspiration here.I am a registered Republican and yet there is no denying the strength and direction of this man. You also learn that he truly enjoys and respects his own role in the political arena."
3,Structural Functions in Music....But Not Grammer,"Very informative. Berry explores deep into the chore of musical functioning. An extremely useful resource for students and professionals alike. However, grammatically, Berry's unending use of extremely long run-on sentences, unnecessary wordiness and excessive punctuation take more than their toll on a reader. The structure of every last sentence in this book is so complicated that it is often difficult to understand what idea Berry is attempting to convey. There are at least four commas and often 1 or more colons and or semi colons in almost every single sentence. A good tool, but difficult beyond necessity to the point of hindrance."
1,How dumb does Nintendo really think we are?,"The number one problem with the GBA (in its original configuration) was that you couldn't see anything you were playing without some sort of overhead lighting. Any review you read, and comments made about the original GBA that is the #1 complaint. So how does Nintendo answer this question, they create a new 100+ dollar item, that while it looks prettier, has nothing more to offer over the original model than a lit screen. How can Nintendo seriously mess over their customer's like this. This is nothing more than a bad answer to a commonly acknowledged problem. I for one will not be buying myself a GBA SP based on the fact that if there is a problem with your product, you don't charge the customer another 100+ dollars to fix it."
2,Not Much New,"If you already own a Game Boy Advance, DO NOT BUY THIS. All this is is the same system, only it has a built-in light for the screen, it folds up, and it has a rechargable battery. It still plays the same games. Also, you can't use headphones with this without an adapter. There are third party solutions to lighting the screen that aren't half bad. If you do not yet own a Game Boy Advance, however, this is recommended over the old GBA because of the new features. Why spend another hundred dollars on a new GBA that does practically the same stuff when you can just wait for the next Game Boy that will play new, better games? Please take this into consideration when buying your Game Boy."
3,Game Boy Advance SP,"This new machine does sound better than the old GBA but really its basically the same all it basically is, is a special light in the back a bigger screen and a rechargeable battery. I don't have one yet but i was thinking about getting one just cause my friend is getting one for her birthday. But as soon as i realized there are no new games and just a light, a bigger screen, and a rechargeable bettery i knew i could probably make the ajustments my self. But this GBA SP is great if you bring it places cause its easy to carry and can probably fit in your pocket. It also is good if you get bored on a camping trip or something. Because of the light it is an advantage at night and the recharger make it better for traveling so you don't have to bring betteries."
4,Good Game player,"My son's plays the game all day long. This one, the screen is a little light, but the sound is good."
4,I got a question,I think you can put regular batteries in the sp insted of the rechargeable one because doing that can help if there is another blackout and you can not recharge your rechargeable battery.
1,Batteries,"We drive alot with our children (10-12 hours) when we go on vacation. What happens when the 10 hours are up in the GBA SP? Recharging 3 kids batteries in the car may be hard to do! On the GBA, I just change the batteries and we are set to go. What do I do when they are dead and we are only half way there? I still think the GBA is better until they get some of the quirks out of the GBA SP. I think I will pass until they come up with still a better solution."
5,Very Excited...!,I think this unit is going to be the best Gameboy ever...! We have always wanted a lit up screen.. and now we will be able to play in the dark...! Soooooooooooooo Cooooooooooooo...!!I had to take my GBA back because the screen was sooooo dark.. so I have waited a very long time for this GBA improvement...! This is gonna be great...!But I do agree with others who are troubled about how we will get our batteries replaced and sad we can't also use regular batteries too...But all the worries about batteries seem sooooo small compared to the excitement about this unit... It's gonna be GREAT...!Some people have aready gotten theirs from Japan and say they are as perfect as expected and they are very satisfied with them...!!
4,Keep kids happy...,"I would recommend this game system to any parent who is going to be travelling anywhere with their young children. I take my six year old niece and 5 year old nephew on trips, and they are both satisfied for long periods of time. In addition to which there are many games available that younger children, at different skill levels, can play. There are easier and more fanciful games for my niece, and more detailed games for my nephew. When they're happy, I'm happy."
4,amazing,"i have to admit releasing the sp so soon after the first game boy advance was stupid because everyones tuck with the original, but it doesnt matter. this new advance is amazing. now u can play at night without a worm light, and youll never have to worry about batterys or scratching the screen up again."
1,Horrible service.. Package never came,This service sucks i never got my package and it was supposed to be shipped dec. 13.. I recommend no one to ever by from them
4,I purchased the SP from Japan in February,"I purchased two of these Game Boy SP's from Japan when they were released. I was not expecting them to be that much better then the regular advance...but boy was I WRONG!! Like I said I bought two...but I have 4 boys. They love these new ones so much, they dont even touch their old ones. I am planning on going out the first day they come out and purchase two more, so each of the boys have one."
4,Incremental improvement,"Nintendo has addressed two of the biggest weaknesses of the Game Boy Advance in the Game Boy Advance SP: screen brightness and battery life. With the SP you don't need a light to hover over the screen (and many times, creating glare of it's own) because the screen is backlit like a laptop computer. It also can be plugged directly into the wall and played or recharged without having to buy a seperate AC adapter.There are other nice things like the folding design which makes the SP more compact to store and carry along. The folding design also minimizes incidental damage to the screen.All in all, the SP design is a step forward for the GameBoy platform. I'd highly recommend it over the standard GBA to anyone considering buying a mobil gaming platform."
4,Um... Help?,"Everything is good exept if the connector is broken and you can't charge, what do you do? PLEASE, ANSWER ME!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,STINKS!,"If you want this, let me tell you what I recommend: the PS One LCD Screen. It has way better graphics! And if you don't want to spend that much, it has cheaper brands. Sure, maybe this is cheaper, but the PS One LCD Screen has better graphics and it has a very very very very very wide selection of games!"
4,I love the GAMEboy advance sp,"I love the Gameboy advance Sp. It's so fun. The buttons push alote easer then the GAMEBOY advace. THe light is a big plus. It feels like a laptop. Becous it folds down. If you have football,soccer or any sport games. You can just watch a game like regular TV. I know it,s a little pricey. BUt it's worth the money. PArents the perfect present."
5,GBA SP= PERFECT,"THE GBA SP IS A MASTER PIECE. I RECIVED IT ON CHRISTMAS AND I'M YET TO PUT IT DOWN. THE THING THATS AWSOME ABOUT IT IS THE LIGHT. IF YOU TURN THE LIGHT OFFF THE PICTURE IS WELL, TERRABLE. WHEN YOU TURN IT ON IT WILL BRIGHTEN THE WHOLE ROOM. THE GBA SP IS AMAZING. THE BATTERY DOES LAST 10-18 HOURS. THE SCREEN IS HUGE COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL GAME BOY. BUY THIS RIGHT NOW."
4,Has a pointy hook that likes to scrape.,"I'm not sure if this is normal for this type of belt, but this one has a hook with which you adjust the size. The hook extends past the rivets and sometimes scrapes my arm. My last belt, of a similar style, did not have this. But overall I am happy. I think I will try to make the hook less sharp with a dremel or file."
2,Full of sugar,"The reason this tastes so good is because it has sugar in it, hidden in the form of date crumbles. You can taste the sugar as soon as you put it in your mouth. Dates are very high in fructose. Compare the nutrition facts on this with red mills five grain cereal: the five grain cereal has 0 grams of sugar per serving while this has 5 gram of sugar.I used to eat this for breakfast but started to gain body fat, so I switched to the 5 grain cereal and the problem has resolved."
5,Bobs Red Mill Old Country Muesli,I luv this product..it is everything you want in a cereal plus this one is really good for you...this is not like the stuff you buy at the grocery store. This one I rate 5 stars.
5,Great breakfast food +,This Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli is fabulous! Get this straight away!
2,Not one of Capra's best,"We're supposed to be amused be an eccentric family but, in fact, most of the family members are downright irritating."
4,This game is great--in 4 words!,"We play this as a family and it is great for helping ""talkative"" kids hone in on the most important aspect of what they are describing. A great challenge for all ages, but very ""doable."" We just skipped the words that might prove to challenging for the less knowledgeable players."
5,Absolutely AMAZING!!,"Arturo Sandoval is the king of Latin jazz and one of the world's most dynamic performers and this album proves just that!This album is sophisticated and elegant, but also displays plenty of fire. I love that ten of the eleven songs are original compositions by Arturo himself, I think they really highlight his renowned Latin side.His band also sounds incredible and really rounds out the whole album. The whole band sounds really excited to be a part of it and the songs just flows so smoothly.It's high-powered and shows remarkable range, but at time is also moody and graceful, and it even showcases Sandoval singing!I love it!"
3,"Smaller then 12"" neck","This collar is cute, I bought it to try and stop our puppy from biting the other dog's neck.The collar runs small, my dog usually wears a 10"" neck collar but this did not fit and we added a hole to the very edge to make it work until we can get a larger one.The material is very easily chewed as the pupy got her teeth on it for about 30 seconds when it was on the sofa (not on the other dog!) and she got a few through teetch holes in the leather."
2,Be warned--it's dull,"Sanders may be a genius in his field but the book is painfully dull and slow, despite it not being very long. Why? Because the writing and presentation of fascinating information should have been much more carefully edited. Instead, we get the persistent drone of ""this is what I'll tell you,"" ""this is what I'm telling you,"" ""this is what I'm going to tell you."" I wish he'd had an editor who could have pushed him to make the book what it needs to be: accessible and inviting to an average intelligent reader. I left academia a long time ago and am reminded of why I was glad to go when I read books presented in this dreary style. I'm not asking this to be dumbed down, but one can write for intelligent readers without being dry and unappealing."
5,A powerful read,"I picked up ""Serendib"" thinking it looked interesting, and couldn't put it down. A powerful story of father/son relationships, this book made me laugh, and broght me to tears. I'll buy a copy for all my brothers, and then buy some more for friends. It's a must-read for any sibling from a large family who wants to know how to navigate the crowded road of parent and child relationships. Not to mention a fabulous peek into life in Sri Lanka."
2,Mangled. Truncated. Raped. Shamefully Violated.,"SHAME ON WHOMEVER DECIDED TO CUT OUT THE EASTER SPECIAL AND PLANET OF THE TURTLEOIDS.Probably a producer for those dirty Power Ranger usurpers. A conspiracy, I say!"
1,This is old book beware,the new book that has been used since 2001 has isbn # 1-587-13-026-2. dont make the same mistake i made.
2,Only to be used with Cisco Academy...,This book lacks a lot of detail. The only way I would recommend this book is if you are also enrolled in a Cisco Academy. If you are enrolled then you have access to a lot more info at Cisco's web site that this book cannot substitute for.
4,Pink Ribbon Lanyard,"The 2 lanyards that I received are just what I was looking for. Perfect to support breast cancer awarness and I liked that there was a ring on the end of the lanyard. The problem that I had while ordering though was that the description said that there was a choice of 6 styles, but I did not get to chose the style that I wanted. I thought that possibly I would receive all 6 for the price."
3,pretty women,"I was hoping for a little more fantcy with these beautiful philippna women, just three outa five for me. Maybe if you have seen this you might disagree and thats ok."
1,A sadly lackluster production,"It is a shame that this seems to be the only widely-distributed video recording of Yeomen of the Guard. In my opinion it was Gilbert and Sullivan's best collaboration, but this production fails to capture its spirit. A crucial element Yeomen's greatness is its balance of humor and pathos, but the humor is completely missing here. Joel Grey, especially, in his drab costume, seems to miss the Point (forgive the pun) entirely. Without seeing his brighter side, I felt no sympathy for him at the end. In fact, all of the actors cover up the humor. I also feel that the choreography is extremely dull. In some places, the chorus walks aimlessly around like zombies. The numerous cuts further detract from this performance, especially in the second act. On the positive side, the singing (with the possible exception of Joel Grey) is generally very good. Nevertheless, if you want to see Yeomen as it was meant to be performed, go see a good live production."
2,You Can See the Girdle Thru Clothes,Not impressed with the fit of this girdle because you can see the imprint around the thigh thru jeans or skirt. The velcro wrap around portion of the girdle actually adds inches to my mid-section which is what I was trying to narrow.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I've owned this stroller for about 2 months. The trigger folding mechanism is terrible. Most of the time, it takes several minutes to fold the stoller because the ""trigger"" button will not release. Also, the child cup holder snapped off exposing a very sharp screw. I've contacted Mia Moda customer service and have yet to get a reply..."
5,excellent Introductory Book for Psych,"Although this was a required book for an Introductory Psych class for university, it is nicely organized and includes comprehensive review & reflect tables and summary & review sections for each chapter. These help to consolidate major concepts and also provide a great study tool. It also contains periodic ""Remember It!"" quick reviews after each major text section to help reinforce comprehension. Another helpful feature is that all key terms are bolded as well as highlighted. It would have been great if the book included access to MyPsychLab, so that I could use those resources also to reinforce my learning, but unfortunately it involves a separate purchase so I will go without that. Amazon's price for a brand new book was cheaper than my college bookstore's used copy price."
5,thanks!,"I needed this book for a class I was taking and all of the bookstores were either out or only had new books, so this helped me out a lot. Thank you."
5,Easy to follow the structure of chapters,Very informational. I liked the presentation patern and the text size which are not so compressed. The book arrived on time too so I did not miss any time at class

3,MBA Class,"This is a required book for MBA class. Content is easy to read, summaries at end of chapter are helpful. I'm a business major not a marketing major so much was new to me. Other reviews state the data in book is dated, my class discussions covered more recent trends in Marketing.I bought paperback used so I got a bargain compared to purchasing new hard bound. I purchased expedited shipping & book arrived as promised in good shape. For the price I paid & fact it's required I got a bargain : )"
1,Reset light goes on often & pain to clean,Dont waste your money on this. I will never buy another bionaire again. My vicks lasted for more than 4 years. This one worked fine for the first couple of months. Now the reset light comes on within few minutes irrespective of the water level. There is enough water on the tray. Also the salt deposits on the small hole in the tray causing it to block the water reaching the heating element. You have to clean it often and make sure there is no salt deposits. Lot of maintenance and still it doesnt work well. I am throwing it and buying a vicks or something similar.
4,Smooth Shifts Now...,"My 2002 Audi allroad 2.7T AWD with 159k had bad slipping, especially at lock-up. Added Lubegard Universal(grey bottle, red cap) and shifts are now crisp and smooth....even with the 159k fluid! The RPMs at 80mph is now at 3400RPM(AWD cars have higher revs), compared to almost 4000RPM before. So, my gas mileage improved by 2-3mpg.In a month, I'm going to do a fresh fluid and filter change and the Lubegard is included, simply because it will extend the useful life of new ATF.If your car has an automatic transmission that has no dipstick, it's supposed to be a so-called, ""lifetime fluid."" Don't ever believe this dealership ploy...change the ATF fluid EVERY 50,000 miles!!!"
5,math,I already own some Anno books. He surely give us a different perspective of math and how it works. I really like it. My children enjoyed Anno's books when they were smaller and then when a bit older we enjoyed them together - trying to figure out what he wanted to show us. I think it stretched my head.
5,Getting Through The Day,"I found this book to very helpful in many different ways. It helps those who have panic attacks and need help dealing with them, those with multiple personalities, and those who just need help getting through the day. I was little nervous about purchasing this book because many people had stated it talked about multiple personalities (I tend to self diagnosis myself with no real evidence), lol. Although, this book does talk about multiple personalities, after the second chapter it just has small sections about multiple personalities which you can skip over if you don't want to learn about multiple personalities. I can definitely say this book has really helped me overcome my issues and I am happy I had the opportunity to find this book and learn about myself on a much deeper level. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs help but don't feel comfortable going to a therapist or psychologist."
3,flag so so. Company not so good,"The flag is what you pay for ,a cheap chinese made flag. The first time I flew it the gromets fell out,so if you buy from them put your own gromets in first. This is the second flag that I have purchased from BC Novelties and both were the same.This would have been my 3rd one but they didnt ship the other one then said that it was lost in the mail. They would ship another.Well it never arived, so I went to Amazon 1 2 3 easy return and where is my stuff. and after 3 weeks and 4 E mailsBC Novelties admitted they were out of stock so they lied to me and Amazon and kept my money for almost a month before it was resolved. I would not do business with them but would find another company to deal with. I have not said anything that was not true and if this gets past the Amazon censors you will get what you pay for.I have to say Amazon did a good job after I turned it over to them but the E mail that I exchanged with the company were turse and deceptive."
2,Solidly Average,"Being a teacher and a solid Blues fan and Jimmy fan on a good day ""Solid Ice,"" would at best receive a C+. Nearly a third of his tunes here are instumental way too much for this fan. Hobart's Blues being the only solid one.The title CD song Solid Ice perhaps in person would go over but not here, it is just WAY too long. Fifteen Minutes is the best here. The only one that gets a B grade and worth listening over along with Hobart. If you like Country, you may enjoy this CD. Unfortunately I don't and three tunes here are basicly Country and don't belong on a Blues CD. Sadly, nothing here has any fire in it's belly. Solild Ice at best is solidly average."
3,"works great, but leaks","This ice pack works great, stays cold for a long time, but they always spring a leak after a while (not a long while, either!) and ooze the gel out. For the price, I expect much better quality."
2,Worked until it dried out,"I purchased this product in 2007. It worked well for several years, both in the freezer as a cold pack, and in the microwave as a heat pack.However, due to limited space, I did not store it in the freezer. Instead I kept it in the cabinet just above the refrigerator. I recently needed to use it, and I discovered that the gel inside the pack had diminished in volume and became quite stiff. It is now unusable.It had never leaked, and there was no evidence of gel leakage around the pack where I had stored it. My only conclusion is that the solvent used in the gel had evaporated through the plastic, leaving behind a stiff, crumbly substance. This may have been due to the increased heat above the refrigerator, accelerating the evaporative process.For the price of this product, I will not buy it again. I would recommend purchasing one of the cheaper versions."
5,Best kept secret,She only made one CD but it's amazing! Buy it! You won't be disappointed. Amaya will rock your musical world! :)
4,Returning to this classic series,"First time I viewed this series was when my local PBS station aired it following the Challenger disaster. I had taped the shows but in the last 20 years they are long gone. So, I'm purchasing the Spaceflight series through Amazon.com. Too bad it's not on DVD. I loved Martin Sheen's narration as he walked us through the history of space flight. Most importantly however, I will view this series in the aftermath of the Columbia accident, a long return to the shuttle program which is now and the U.S. space program stuck in neutral. Perhaps we can regain the wonder and promise of manned space. This series showed us how it started."
1,Not sold,"I only used this product for 30 days, but unfortunately found no change in my body's behaviors. I was so hoping I would."
3,Can't See Anything to Point,"Like a lot of supplements, haven't seen much effect from Pycnogenol as of yet (I've been taking it for forty-five days--so this may be unfair until I continue taking it a while longer). One can only wait and hope, I guess."
3,As text books go. . .,"It's ok. I do like the first person stories which apparently were the impetus for the book's origin. I purchased new from Amazon and did not get the code for publisher's website for student helps. I'll live, but I was disappointed. This isn't a keeper and I'm selling it back as soon as the class is finished."
4,A spectacular performance...,"..with lesser known singers. Hans Knappertsbusch is at his most inspired and exciting in this electrifying performance. The two leads, Helena Braun and Gunther Treptow, are not among the very greatest to have sung these roles, but they are both very, very good, and in this performance they rise to great heights. Ferdinand Frantz as King Marke, however, stops the show with his extraordinarily moving and beautiful account of Marke's big scene. His is a voice for the ages. (BTW, he was also Helena Braun's husband.)"
3,big Daddy,"This is a good gun.The accuracy is alright but it is inconsistant.I like mine a lot, it is very fun to shoot! But if you want to fight getsomething else.Over all a good gun.Good buy for the money."
1,Are they all duds?,"I've had two of these shipped to me in the last week. Both showed up DOA. I contacted Stanton Technical Support, fully described how I followed all directions, hit all the right switches, etc., etc. Nothing happened. No nada. Motor did not run, the unit did not light up. The best they could suggest was that it would require factory service to replace a fuse. For a brand new, $400+ turntable? No thanks. Contrary to the maxim that the third time is the charm, I will take a refund."
4,COOL! LOL!,This is a very cool program! The music can be turned down if it annoys but it is pretty cool. Anyone who gets bored just biking in an empty room you can now bike in Scotland! This is very cool!
4,nice functional cell phone holder,The price was good. The holder is of good quality. The belt clip seems to rotate a little too easily. Sometimes I will notice that my holder and phone are upside down. Also the holder was just a little too big for my Nokia 1100 phone (both height and width). Otherwise i it's great!
1,Kids ONLY,"I read this Book in TWO Minutes. Its for KIDS, ONLY. I thought was More than That from the reviews. It is NOT. Its a Large STORYBOOK, with about 10 Words per page. Dont waste Your Money. You Can Go to Book store and read it In two Minutes for FREE. Unless Of Course You have a Kid, then Be Good for Them Maybe. But Not if Your an ADULT truly Grieving. Get the Rainbow Bridge - Pet Loss is Heavens Gain. Im going to take this KIDS Book to My Vets, And Give it to Them to Give Out to Someone who Has kids, when A Pet Dies."
5,Wonderful read if you have had pet loss..,My family cried a lot after reading this book; our well loved cat had just passed away. It helped us in the grieving process.
5,Cat Lovers of All Ages...,Everyone we know who loses a beloved cat receives this book. My personal copy holds the names of all the cats who have thus far blessed me with their company. The words are simple and speak right to the heart.
5,Great book for young children,I definitely recommend this book as a gentle way to talk about the loss of a pet with children. It is a great way to bring up questions that youngsters may have about losing a loved one.
3,Effective but some flaws,"First off: the first unit I received was defective but as usual Amazon's customer service was outstanding. The replacement is fine and is actively removing gallons of water from my basement. I saved the price of the pump model by routing the water drain to the water pump connected to my gas furnace and that works fine too.The product has some shortcomings though. First, the fan is quite loud. Don't even consider using this in a living space. Second, the fan runs all the time, even when the set humidity level is reached. That may be necessary to maintain and accurate measurement of the ambiant humidity but it's wasteful and noisy. The auto-on/off timer is useless because it only allows to set the start time OR the stop time and it has to be reset every time. A more useful feature would have allowed me to set the unit to start at 8 PM every night and stop at 8 AM the next morning for example. Lastly, the drain tubing included is way too short so plan on buying some extra."
5,A very good overview of telecommunications policy,This is a great overview of American Telecommunications Policy. I wish there was a such a book for each area of federal policy!
2,Not a good book to learn data structure in Java,"This book focuses on the AB-specific part of AP test. It starts with a good idea as a beginner's book by having lab sessions and exercises. But the book does not clearly explain concepts and in general lacks of examples, some lab session descriptions are confusing, and some exercises are more suitable with different solutions rather than the data structures it suggests. A better approach is to go with a good ""regular"" Java data structures book, such as the one by Rober Lafore. These books target a broader readers and do a much better job in presenting data structures in Java. To use these regular data structure books specifically for AB exam, one could just skip the non-AB parts of content."
4,nice but....,"The canopy was beautiful when I put it up in May.I now wish that I had ordered the beige one, because now it's August and the blue top has faded from the sun.The waterproofing is still holding up well. It's been great to protect us from bugs, and the frame has held up well in strong winds. I will probably contact the company to see if I can purchase a new top.I am glad I bought this item, I just wish I had picked the lighter color."
3,The Trial,"This was a very good movie. Interesting storyline. Wonderful actors. However, too pricey for a rental. I always enjoy a movie with a good ending."
4,before there was the Galactic Cowboys...,"This is the band that Monty Colvin and Alan Doss were in before Galactic Cowboys. I really like it, but that could be because I bought it when it can out. I was already a King's X fan, it was produced by Sam taylor and they all were listed as bass/vocal, guitar/vocals, drums/vocals, with no lead vocals listed(sound familiar?).The songs are pretty good, the vocals are better(in my opinion)than the GC stuff, but it's so different, it's hard to compare them.I would by it if you're a GC fan or King's X(but don't expect Dave to sound like Doug)."
2,Lacks a Certain Spark,"I was disappointed with this book. It was just another Scottish time travel romance, indistinguishable from so many others I've read. While competently written, it fell flat in characterization, making it easy for the setting to take center stage. The ending was disappointing, too, and somewhat contrived. All in all, in this reader's opinion, the book does not live up to the hoopla. Not all that bad, just nothing new. Nothing different."
2,Simplistic,"I bought this because of the positive reviews, and while it wasn't a bad read, I found it ultimately very.simplistic, although I can see the romantic idea of living in another age being attractive to young women, the thought of someone from this era being happy living hundreds of years ago without dentists, modern medicine, enduring the lack of cleanliness etc. is truly difficult to imagine. The smells alone would be enough to knock one over. The writing was just soso and I won't be reading another of her novels."
4,I liked it,"This was interesting. I liked it. I just was tired of the cheesy moments, but it is nice to time travel!"
4,A Good Read,"I enjoyed this book and thought about it long after I finished reading it, the characters were so real, and the plot kept my interest and moved along freely. I think everyone would love reading this book, it is great! Another great new book is Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. This book also goes straight to your heart and becomes a permanent resident . .read both books!"
3,UNA COMEDIA MUSICAL,"Esta comedia musical de Leos Janacek no es de gran valor artístico, al margen de algunos pasajes de evidente inspiración el resto de la obra suena superflua sin llegar a ser desagradable en ningún momento. Con seguridad la mayor valía de éste álbum es la interpretación, puesto que el elenco que utiliza el Maestro Keilberth es de primera categoría: Fritz Wunderlich, Kurt Bohme, Wilma Lipp y poder escuchar estas voces prodigiosas siempre nos proporciona felicidad. La grabación no es de lo mejor puesto que está realizada en 1.959 en VIVO, por lo cual no se puede comparar con los estándares de grabación actual, pero se deja oír con tranquilidad. La presentación es buena con fotografías de los artistas y de muchas escenas, pero NO tiene Libretto."
2,"Same old, same old.","A great concept, but I didn't find the chosen passages to be particularly meaningful or inspiring. I ended up giving my copy to the library book sale."
2,Demo is all you need,"This game is entertaining as it is meant for co-op. If you are playing by yourself, wait for gears of war 2 or just play gears of war over again. In the beginning of the game, the graphics and the gameplay was very entertaining. However, after 4 or 5 levels of the same thing without a decent storyline, the game gets extremely repetitive."
3,Not Gears,"For some reason I thought this would be like gears of war, you know another third person shooter(which I love). This is not gears which is okay I guess, but be warned this game is pretty complex especially the controller scheme. Still overall pretty cool game."
1,One word.... terrible,This game is just terrible... truly terrible. I was able to finish it in under a day and must agree with the review above. The game does look nice but the story is so contrived and sounds as though it were written as part of a John MCcain election speech. We must stop the terrorists... blah blah blah more terrorists and suicide bombers :America is the best. I think the worst part of this game though is the aiming system. It would be fun to play online if the aiming was not so difficult up close. You can easily shoot someone down but then you have to back up to kill them again before they get up and kill you. Also if someone leaves when you are playing online the game ends.... it really sucks when you're in the middle of a 30 minute battle and someone decides they dont want to play anymore.Overall I would say rent this game or avoid it altogether.I should have known from the cheesy music during the commercial that it would be like this.
3,Awful!,"I looked forward to this game forever. and when I finaly got it..just YUCK. i'm used to playing Call of Duty 4. and I guess i'm comparing to that, but i Realy do not like this game. I feel it is a HUGE waste of my money! and i hate that.I took it in and traded it after 2 days. big money loss there."
3,"New, good idea, not to well implemented","This is a game I was anxiously awaiting the release for. The game has a great idea of building a game around a 2 man team, which I was looking forward to as this is pretty much a first. The graphics are decent however the gamelplay is not very realistic at all. I was hoping for more realism. The gameplay is a bit quirky. This is a good start and expect the sequel if there is one to be much better. It is a decent game, but somewhat boring and repetetive...NOTE: I may be a bit biased due to the extremely high expectations playing Call of Duty 4 has placed on us..."
3,"""TiVo Hacks"" Disappoints","Book contains lots of hacks, but lacks clarity. Writing seems muddled at times, and instructions for hacks such as backing up TiVo's disk and adding a new disk are unclear/confusing (at best). Although I've not been a TiVo hacker, I do build & repair PCs as a business (and dabble in LINUX)...so I consider myself to be somewhat knowledgable.Ultimately, the book disappointed me. I shall keep searching for one that's clear, accurate and useful."
5,"Finally, something that makes sense.","I have read more financial advice books than I care to count and this book was the one that finally made sense to me. I have been floundering around, investing here and there, without a feeling of actually knowing what I was doing. Mr. Staton's methods are a great comfort to new investors, especially those with limited funds. It takes the guesswork out of wondering whether you're investing in a solid company or one that will fold before you have a chance to make a profit. Mr. Staton lists hundreds of companies that have stood the test of time and you can feel comfortable investing in any one of them. I found his book to be easy to follow, with a lot of solid and practical advice. I feel as though I finally have a real investment plan. This book is a treat for long-term investors and for those who are new to the investing universe."
4,Hardwood Bowls Are The Greatest!,"Fresh Salads seem to taste better in wooden bowls. It is easy toss the salad and get all of the dressing coated to the ingredients and then serve. The wooden bowls clean so easy in soap and water. They are easy to store until ready to use again. Great for serving condiments, chips, and other foods too."
3,Wrong title !!!,"This little book is more about what I call ""locational geography"". It lists geographical places instead of geographical terms. Still a fairly good reference book. Also, difficult to read due to very SMALL print. For definitions of geographical terms, including all earth science terms, I recommend McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Earth Science."
4,"Bright, narrow beam, heavy","I bought this unit for use in early morning and evening bike commuting. It's quite expensive in comparison to units I've owned before, but that seems to be the case when you make the jump from AA powered units to Li-Ion packing rechargeables. The largest drawback of this unit is probably the battery -- it's quite large and heavy in comparison to other units in its price range. My commute is short and I ride a mountain bike so I've opted to live with the weight, but I'd steer someone away from this unit if they're concerned about every ounce. Otherwise, the light is plentiful and it is supposed to go for a whopping 6 hours on high output. The beam is a bit narrow, but that works for me since I'm on mostly straight sidewalks and roads. The unit seems fairly well built, but I am disappointed that it's made in China. Many other units in this price range are Made in the USA."
5,Great book !!!,Buy this and give to anyone hurting from pain physically or spiritually. Phil Yancey is a great writer but even more a great Christian man of God who really comes through in this book wanting to make sense of the senseless.His Peace and Grace...
3,doesn't do itself justice,"I can see why Yancey is such a popular Christian writer. He has an empathy and ability about him that draws you in. He is an excellent writer, but while he wrote about pain, he never really answered his own question. We don't particularly understand pain any better or much of why God allows it, though Yancey does touch on it. He just didn't spend enough time developing the book. You could see where he got started and just petered out. I'd like to see this great writer tackle the subject again, this time carrying it through to its conclusion."
4,God is Good all the Time,"I was so excited to see this book for free on Kindle. Philip Yancey seems to put his finger on what I want to know, meditate on, or just understand about my relationship with God. It took awhile for me to read, as the substance needed thinking on between chapters. Yancey did not dissapoint... finally near the end was my answer."
5,great book,I loved it! It was a book that I would most definatly enjoyed reading this book. Philip Yancey is a great author.
5,Classic book treating question of pain,I really like the access to this classic woirk from Phil Yancey and look forward to other works from him as they exists
1,Not recommended,"I love the Holman Christian Standard Bible in print form due to its accuracy combined with readability. I also have several Audio Bibles and like most of them very much.Unfortunately, this particular audio bible is one of the two worst versions I have. The narrator's accent doesn't bother me here, but what does is that the music throughout the reading is so loud and distracting as to make it nearly impossible to listen to the bible.I would recommend any of the Max McLean ""Listener's"" bibles (KJV, NIV or ESV) or a reading by Alexander Scourby as an alternative to this reading. Either of these versions can also be partially listened to from their websites for evaluation before buying."
1,Too many bugs and no Raid.,"Somehow I was able to play this game to the end. The game had a habit of freezing up on me. It was pretty cool but the story was weak, however, there's a twist at the end which leaves possibility for a sequel. After a while I felt like I was just going through the motions of going from one level to the next. It's good to play only once if the bugs don't get you first."
5,I love this deep-fryer!,"This deep-fryer is the best thing I have bought in ages! The large capacity means I can cook enough food to satisfy even MY family, in no time! It cleans up easily and everything comes out delicious. I haven't bothered to test the actual oil temp. since it has all passed my personal litmus test of non-greasy food output. Love the design! NO MESS afterwards. I highly recommend this fryer."
3,Hmmm,I put a big write up on this cd on here and I guess amazon didn't like www.noiserecords.com in my text. Check it out...it has all of the songs.....you be the judge
3,It Works,"I carry a Motorola i355 (one brick of a phone) with the case. It holds the phone tightly enough to keep it from falling out. Only downfall is that it constantly turns upside down on me. I haven't lost the phone yet, but it's a good idea to keep a watchful eye."
1,This thing sucks!,"I e-mailed support to get help with the audible alarm, and ultimatly I was told to buy a different one which could disable the alarm. This thing has a REALLY annoying beep, which for me went off about every 5 minutes."
4,Naked boys bare all!,"Naked boys singing is a fun romp of a dvd. A musical with ""balls"" - it is fun and well choreographed. While this is a video of a stage production it is about the best film of a theater show I've seen. While there is a little of the ""feel"" of the show lost without a live audience in a stage setting, it doesn't lose much of its charm. Yes, the boys are naked, but the show quickly becomes more about the songs and their deeper meanings than just skin. There are numerous comical moments in addition to a few more serious ones. You won't want to miss ""The Naked Maid"", ""Fight the Urge"",and ""Jacks Song"". With mostly gay themes it's not done as a ""Chipendales"" video. and while it's not your mother's ""Rogers & Hammerstein"" it is a modern musical not to miss."
2,"Not Too Great, Not Too Bad","Let's start with the negatives first:1) The singing is often off-key. These guys obviously weren't chosen for their vocal technique.2) The stage dressings and sets are drab or non-existent. Nothing to look at...except naked boys running around. It's fun for the first ten minutes or so, but after that...ho-hum.3) I would not pay to go see this in person; I fell asleep the first time I watched it.Now the positive things:1) Only a couple songs were clever and memorable. Some of my favorites were ""The Gay Maid"" and ""Perky Little Porn Star.""2) This video WILL offend conservatives and most Christians. That's a plus!3) The added featurettes on the DVD are interesting to watch. They detail how and why the video was made, etc.."
5,Very good!,"This book is not only about dinosaurs. It is also about us. Where we come from, where we are going... There are no answers in the book, but at least you will find a lot of honest thought."
4,Junior Golf Clubs,"Upon opening the box we were pleasently surprised by this nice looking set that is perfect for little people. The stand was easy to engage and the handle made it easy to carry. It was a gift for our 5 year old grandson, so time will tell as to how functional the set turns out to be for him."
4,WORKS GREAT AND BEATS HECK OUT OF PHONE STORE PRICES,CAR-CHARGER WORKS PERFECTLY. EXACTLY THE SAME AS CHARGERS COSTING 10 TIMES AS MUCH OR MORE!
3,Nice but ill fitting,"I bought these for my husband for his birthday. He loved the look of them, but when he tried them on they didn't fit true to size. He tried a different pair of socks to no avail... and sent them back. Too bad, as they are great looking. They run big. Hope this helps."
2,Not so hot,chose it based on price mainly. plastic cracked when I tried to use it so I bought a metal mender for a few bucks more
2,Color bled in the rain,"I bought an orange collar for my white dog in April 2012. When I took her out in the rain the color bled and turned her neck orange. Amazon gave me a refund, but told me to keep the collar. I just took her out in the rain again and, unfortunately, forgot she was wearing the collar. I've now got a Goldendoodle who looks like she's wearing an orange fur bandana. I'm really disappointed because I like the lights."
4,Helps My Dog Stand Out,"I became super freaked when my dog caught me off guard and ran away from me after seeing a cat, ending up in the neighbors yard after crossing the road in front of my house. After that, I realized it wasn't worth not having some kind of collar that glows to help oncoming cars see her.That said, I've only used this collar a couple of times. It must be turned on, and there is a constant orange or flashing pattern that you can set it to. Dogs with really long hair may not benefit though if their hair works its way over the collar.For me though, its great. Just not sure how long it will last.Please take a look at my book while you're shopping today.The Journal: Man's Quest For The Perfect Match"
1,"terrible product, or worst product ever?","I've been buying various products on Amazon for about 8 years now, but this is the first time I've been so disgusted with a product that I felt the need to leave a review. The first day was actually pretty good. The collar provided solid visibility. The the dog got a little dirt on it (dogs like dirt), and now it's barely visible. I removed the light, washed the collar, and reassembled, but the light was still very faint.If you're using this to see you dog glow around the bedroom you might be fine, but don't expect the same results if you take it outdoors. This collar is not for the adventurous type. This will be our next purchase:[...]"
4,Smart Item,Difficult to adjust. Only about an inch available to adjust the size. Medium is too big ande small is tight.
3,Missing promised battery takes away from 5 stars,"I would rate this collar 5 stars for performance except that when it arrived, it was was missing the all-important battery that the product description stated was included. I was disappointed that I had to purchase a battery from a local store for $12.99 before I could even use the collar! (Expensive battery because it is one of those specialty batteries you find inside wristwatches.) Otherwise, the collar works great--very visible in low light conditions. The darker the surroundings, the brighter the collar appears."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased the DVD version of Calendar Creator 12 Deluxe. I have had nothing but trouble with it. The technical support is AWFUL. I keep getting a form e-mail (the only support available) stating that I need to uninstall and reinstall. I have done this and several other steps over and over to no avail. The corruption is in the Art Gallery Browser. I cannot select or import pictures to my calendar. I have begged for a replacement DVD or my money back, but have yet to get either. I would suggest using a company that is more supportive and backs their product."
3,Not an exact fit,Works fine but not an exact fit. Has simple tabs on sides that take some adjusting to keep it in place. Original equipment had springs along each side that ensured that the unit fit snuggly.
1,Will never buy an import item again,The DVD was an import and unable to view the movie. Disappointed that I purchased something I can't use...won't bother to send it back. I have purchased import CD's before no problem...DVD's must be different
4,Keeps me going,"This coffee is priced fairly,keeps me buzzing all day long and tasts good.I'm a truck driver and need to be alert during those long boring days"
5,Miles at his best,"Miles is absolutely briliant in this recording. his improvizations are both creative and so relaxed. surrounded by jazz greats such as John Coletrain on tenor sax, Philly Joe on Jones on drums, Paul Chmbers on bass, and Red Garland on piano,this recording is a special treat and a must for the jazz collection."
2,Disappointing Coltrane,"At least until Ascension Coltrane could do no wrong for me. However, I recently heard Cookin' for the first time and was shocked at how bad his soloing was. Every one else - great. But I can only think something was wrong with Trane during the recording - maybe drug problems - but I am now wary about buying any of the rest of the Prestige 'set' despite all of the good reviews."
5,Blues Album of the Year,"Simply put: This is the best blues album I've heard in years.Listen to the sound-clips here and check out the free videos on his website. I first heard of Watermelon Slim from hearing/seeing the video of him doing Howlin Wolf's ""Smokestack Lightning"" on his website (somebody recommended I check it out). I was so blown away by what I heard that I immediately got this disc. Very few albums blow me away these days like this one. Amazing blues!"
4,Bob Bailey the Best Johnny Dollar,Yours Truly Johnny Dollar starring Bob Bailey was an action-packed thrill ride of adventure and detection.And Bailey had the perfect voice and vocal mannerism for the lead role.Its too bad that none of 5-part 15 minute serial from 1955-1955seasons aren't included in this collection.Vincent Price does make a guest appearance in the 2nd episode of CD # 1.
5,An Astonishing View From The Inside,"Leanne Chilton's victory is revealed through an emotional journey of chilling, revealing passages into a world many have never understood. It is true that this is must-have information for those suffering seizure disorders. But it is equally true that it speaks of the silent acts of valor that go unseen for their grace and determination. Seizure disorders needn't have touched one's life to draw strength and inspiration from this remarkable work."
1,The lemon,"It isn't two months yet and the dehumidifier isn't working. I received it without an instruction booklet, without information who to call or where to take the item for repair. I had bought one two years ago and it was working fine although yesterday, I began to have some problems with it also but I got it to work again. This new one is a real lemon."
1,DON'T BUY THIS DEFECTIVE UNIT!!!! DEAD on ARRIVAL,"Right out of the box the pump failed to remove water, as did the hose option and even the bucket option. I was told there must be some ""sensor"" problem; to get it repaired or replaced I have to pay for this huge heavy machine to be shipped to another state- at the cost of perhaps 1/4 of what I paid in the first place. Don't Buy this product!!"
2,Hit or miss,"Echoing similar posts, the main motivation for purchasing this dehumidifier was the pump to remove the necessity of emptying the water bucket manually (as often as 2X per day). Ordered the first one and the pump never worked from the start. After repeatedly trying to deal with service, still no luck. A second inadvertently arrived and upon trying it has worked perfectly. However it is only 2 weeks old. The unit works well otherwise.Update: The pump has gotten louder and louder. It finally gave out yesterday. After checking out other similar brands that incorporate a pump, I have come to conclusion that the only dependable, quiet and reasonable option is an external dehumidifier pump kit. They range from $48-$120."
2,Lack of quality controll,"New, out of the box, I turned this dehumidifier on and what a noise it made.I removed the cabinet from around the unit and found that the fan blades were striking the top of the compreser. Because the threads of two of the three bolts that hold the compresser in place were stripped and the nuts could not be tightened down on those bolts thus the compresser leaned over to get itself under the fan blades. I added washers to the bolts so that the nuts didn't have as far to go to tighten and re-applied the nuts which pulled the compresser upright and now the fan blades don't hit. The person who installed those compresser nuts had to know they had stripped the bolts but sent it out to the customer anyway.Now, two days later and the pump doesn't pump.I've written DeLonghi telling them that I will ship the unit at my expense to either DeLonghi or Amazon, their choice but that I wanted my money back.I'll keep you posted.Pete"
1,Freeze up,"Our one year old Delonghi DE400P freezes solid. I inquired with the manufacturer and they gave me retoric and a graph of when the humidifier will run into difficulty. Its now in the basement on a 88 degree day, the coil is a block of ice and it is doing nothing but eating electricity. The nearest service center will cost more in gas and time than the unit is worth. I advise passing on this one."
3,Not A Good Fit for Guinea Pigs.....,"I initially got this toy as a way to satisfy the natural chewing instinct in my two guinea pigs. However, to my dismay, they figured out how to tear the thing apart in approximately 2 hours. They were not interested in the walnut at all, and were unwilling to play with the toy after it was torn apart. I ended up throwing it away. :( I'm giving this toy three stars due to the fact that other reviews suggest that this may be a good toy for other critters such as rabbits and chinchillas, but I would not recommend this to anyone who owns pigs."
3,My guinea pig's smarter than your bunny!,"The two other reviewers' bunnies must not be as smart as my cavy! My little guy figured out how to pull apart the little orange pegs holding the nibbler together in about two hours flat. It was fun watching him dissect it; the reason why this doesn't get more stars from me is because once he pulled it apart, it was essentially just a bunch of colored logs, which is fine, but this is a bit pricey for just some chew sticks."
3,"Interesting premise, but ghost is a good description","I enjoyed much of this mystery. The mystery itself was interesting and hard to figure out. The main character was the only one who really didn't come to life. I finished the book without a really clear picture of her. I found myself not really caring about her lovelife. Ben appears to be a non-entity, which makes me wonder what she sees in him. He doesn't seem to even really get involved in the murder investigation, and lets face it, a movie star and a senator are dead--unrealistic!"
3,Okay,"The magazine is for a spring gun, so I was not expecting much. The magazine worked for a while, but managed to aquire BBs on the inside after a while and started to split open. If you have enough money to get the UHC MP5, I would recommend going to AirsoftGI and looking for something better."
3,"Informative, but Dated","This work interviews both people who support and condemn lotteries. However, the work clearly falls on the side of condemning them.It spells things out. Minors have easy access to buying scratch-off tickets. People can become addicted to lottos. Also, the funds do not address education and seniors as they claim. I was not happy seeing Calvin Butts interviewed as he has made homophobic comments in the past.Still, this work is dated! It features Senator Paul Simon who died at least five years ago. It even shows the World Trade Center towers standing. Bill Curtis ends by saying, ""Maybe one day the lotto will be curbed."" Well, it's a decade after this production aired and lotto is stronger than ever and the clouds have not fallen from the sky."
1,BEWARE THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE DESCRIBED ON PAGE OR BOX,"THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE ARTIFLIX DVD THE SEA WOLFTHIS IS NOT THE MOVIE DESCRIBED ON PAGE OR BOXThe Sea Wolf (1941) -Directed by Michael Curtiz. With Edward G. Robinson, Ida Lupino, John Garfield, Alexander Knox.What I received wasThe Sea Wolf (TV 1993) - IMDbDirected by Michael Anderson. With Charles Bronson, Catherine Mary StewartChristopher ReevePLEASE NOTE THE OTHER REVIEWS LISTED APPEAR TO BE FROM THE VHS TITLE NOT THE DVD!!!"
4,For one????,"Although I like the Melnor QCs (hence 4 stars for the connector), the price for this piece is waaaaaaayyyy out of line. $5.60 for one piece is highway robbery. An entire set of 4 couplers costs a few pennies less than this single piece. I see that someone else is selling the same male quick connect for under $2.00 plus shipping. If I buy a few, then the shipping isn't as much of a hit. This is the most commonly used piece as it's the one that hooks to each watering device (wand, sprinkler,watering timer, etc) so you may need a few."
5,efficient!,"I would just like to praise the efficiency of your service, especially on its delivery. Although there is a slight misconception on the actual delivery charges when the item gets to me. There are still local charges which I thought would have been included in the initial charges I paid for since I chose the courier and particular sending service. My suggestion is, if possible, to include all the charges in the order already so when the item gets to the recipient he or she wouldn't still have to add more money before getting the product."
5,Excellent textbook and series,"The selections in this literature series along with the questions and activities make you really think and relate to the various literary forms and texts. I cannot commend this series enough to someone seeking a great tutoring or supplemental resource. It is great fun and makes the pieces, the authors, and the characters come vibrantly alive in the reader's imagination."
5,great knife,when i first bought this i didnt know how big it would be. i bought it for my neice and it was too big for her so i kept it for my self hahaha. it looks vicious and is a heck of a cutter. i use it around the house to trim plants and palm fromms. the clip works on both sides and up or down. it is very easy to flick open with either hand.
4,Easy Connect,Works pretty well as long as it is used in a set; doesn't work as well with other similar connectors.
1,This download version does not work,"As others have reported, the digital download version of this game has a number of issues. Online modes are not supported and patching is disabled because the software believes the game has been cracked or stolen. The same check that disables multiplayer causes a number of bugs in the single player game as well, since all the costs of items in the game are bumped up by as much as 10x the correct price. These costs even affect the initial portion of the game, making it impossible to advance past renting a car from the airport.Until Amazon can get this sorted out, avoid this product."
3,Good Kindergarten read,I was looking for a good book on the first Thanksgiving to read to Kindergarteners and this book fits that criteria but I wish it had a little more factual info about that era. It was almost tooo general.
5,Birdman of Alcatraz,"One of my favorite movies. Burt Lancaster's acting in this movie is terrific. The story, based on real events, is amazing!"
2,Great while the pump lasted,"I bought a unit from Costco less than a year ago. It's worked pretty well, fills the bucket a lot. However, I prefer to use the pump. The pump died a couple months ago. I'll be returning it to Costco asap.I really don't recommend this dehumidifier based on DeLonghi's customer service and the record of these devices, shown in the reviews."
1,Defective pump,After a month the pump died makes very loud burr noise. I brought it back to HD and got another. I shouldn't have. The pump died on the new one 6 months later.
1,This is not the book you're looking for,"I bought this book while looking for books on improving right-brain function. The title and sub-title made it sound like something I was looking for. Since my local library system didn't have it and since it was very inexpensive via Kindle, I decided to download it.It's an interesting dissertation on right/left brain thinking in the Japanese culture. It is not a self-help book or a general treatise on whole-brain thinking. For that, look elsewhere."
5,Read the book! See the movie!!!,Great fun to read! Not your typical sci-fi shoot-em-up-evil-aliens encounter. Actually a whimsical coming-of-age story with an unusual twist.Interesting Trivia: Can of Worms was one of the first really successful movies made for and by the Disney Channel. Check out the cast members on IMDB.com to find some very high-wattage surprises!
3,Skims the Surface,"I enjoyed reading this book as Antonia Fraser is an engaging writer - but felt the author skimmed over many important points in too quick a fashion. We get a good description of King Louis as a young man but he is strangely absent (personality wise) as an adult and a ruler. I would have enjoyed some real insight into MA and her life, rather than a simple retelling of her life story. A good book for those unacquainted with French history but those looking for more may be disappointed."
3,Marie Antoinette The Journey,"I am sure that this would be a fantastic book to read...that's why I purchased it. However, the type is so small, even with bifocals I am having trouble reading for any length of time. I think that if I would have known this prior to purchasing it, I might have bypassed and purchased it via a Kindle where one can change the size of the font."
2,Disappointing,"I am an Antonia Fraser fan, but I found this book disappointing. It is very hard to follow. There are too many characters to keep straight, too many different names for the same person. Ms. Frazier sometimes refers to people by their family names, sometimes by their first names, and sometimes by their titles. I found myself constantly going back in the book trying to figure out exactly who she was talking about. In addition, I didn't find much in this book that I didn't learn in a college history course The writing style is a bit stilted. Some of the words she chooses to use are technically correct, but they have a slightly archaic feel to them and, in my opinion, interupt the narrative flow. This is definitely not one of Ms. Frazier's better books."
2,History as a soap opera,"A biography which hides, behind an overwhelming amount of details, a disarming lack of substance. Nothing more than a historical soap opera. From Antonia Fraser, author of an exemplary ""Mary Stuart"", it is legit to demand much more.It is singular that two of the best queen's biographies of the post Zweig and Castelot era were never translated into English: the moving ""Chère Marie-Antoinette"" (1988) by Jean Chalon and the unreachable ""Marie-Antoinette l'insoumise"" (2002) by Simone Bertière, maybe the best work on Marie Antoinette I've ever read. Whoever knows French should not miss these books. I also signal the recent French DVD release of the movie ""L'Autrichienne"" (1989), written by the specialist Castelot, based entirely on the proceedings' minutes of the trial of the queen: a stunning piece of work with an absolutely superb Ute Lemper as Marie Antoinette."

2,Not as advertised and too much truble for cost,"When received, all that was in the package was the gaming unit. No USB cable as advertised, and no program disk to link up to Gameshark.com.You can add new codes manually, but they will not save.Worthless!!! Don't waste your money!"
1,Do Not Buy This!,"My son took a chance on this even though I warned him about the negative reviews. He said since I was not buying it used he may have better luck with a new one.WRONG! He said it started out fine, and he even followed the directions but after the second day when he turned on his SP, it would not work anymore. He said the Gameshark broke his SP and he wanted his money back but on his receipt it said NO RETURNS. His hard earned money went down the drain.One thing for sure, you do not get what you pay for! DO NOT BUY THIS! DO NOT TAKE THE CHANCE ON RUINING YOUR SP! THIS IS A PIECE OF GARBAGE!"
4,"its good, and worth the money","this is a good buy for anyone stuck on a gba game. I used it to get infinite health, amo, and extra levels on my games. It was worth the money, but it freezes from time to time, and does no real damage excepts it somethimes might when it freezes forget what i just imput, but i found out from another review to lighten up on the number of codes i put in and if I have a problem to reset it so now it works great"
1,gameshark stinks!!!!!!!,"This device stinks. It might work once, but after that it won't ever work. Don't buy this, it is a waste of your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Too bad I can't give it a 0."
2,"Neat product, while it lasted...","This thing was amazing, it did great, until suddenly it just stopped working. This could have been a perfect item if it wasn't for its durability problem. I mean, how long is one week anyways? If it lasts a week it should be WAY cheaper."
5,Gameboy Advance/Micro Gameshark,The gameshark is a helpful tool to level up your characters if you don't have enough time to devote to it. It even works on the new gameboy micro. Recommend it to anyone who is stuck on a particular level in a game.
1,Not that funny,"I was really looking forward to watching this. The idea for the show is a great one, but the show falls flat. It is choppy and boring. There a few funny moments, but they do not make up for the loss of your time watching the series. I would not recommend buying."
4,"Down Home Licks, Urban Flavor, Gospel Harmonics = Hot CD","This CD is one of those that you will wish you had when it becomes a collectors item ala Greg Henderson. It is a blend of down home licks (Beale St.) complemented by a full portion of urban contemporary tradition. It wouldn't surprise me if someone told me that some of the harmonic structure was the result of sitting in somebody's church. I am particularly fond of the CD because in a pinch the music is danceable. The CD follows on the heels of the much celebrated, It's All About Love, and shows the maturation of a composer and band that you won't forget. It is a must for the serious collector."
4,Grieving gracefully,"I am so glad I read ""One Foot on a Banana Peel."" This book offered so much insight about faith and keeping faith during our saddest, darkest moments. The author never waivered from her convictions even when she at her lowest; when she was in doubt, she questioned God, and listened to the answer. So many of us ask for God's help but are too impatient to wait for His response.Jane Harber's section on Forgiveness was incredibly helpful to me, and I have dog earred and highlighted several sections of this fairly small chapter. It was as though she wrote the words just for me.Thank you Ms. Harber for sharing your sad and uplifting story. Through your selflessness, I have learned a lot about myself. Please keep writing!"
4,A real thriller right to the end.,I thought this book was even more exciting than her last. Kyle was such a nasty weirdo. Erin is such a sweet innocent to be in New York and have to deal with Kyles. Her trip to England with Steve was so exciting especially the quaint B&B they stayed at. I look forward to her next installment in the Erin Tyler medical mysteries.
4,Classic Hollywood Blopers,Another great classic Hollywood Blooper tape. I wish these came out in a DVD format thay are wonderfully fun to watch AAA++++
1,Balderdash,"This book is so bad it's pathetic. As 2012 approaches so many authors have created psuedo-scientific codswallop to cash in on it it's ridiculous. After 2012 these will be cast upon the ash heap of history, hopefully including this one."
4,Used to fill a lamp,If you've ever seen the lamps that you can fill with anything... well my daughter is filling one with bottle caps. Cool.
1,one pad,"One pad is all they give you, it says pads. I know for dollar doesn't seem like they would give you more than one, but I wanted to buy a box one box of pads it's kind of misleading when it says pads and shipping was very high, seems like a waste just to send you one pad."
2,You gotta be pretty desparate...,"Nice collection of quotes from a few dozen reality shows, grouped into topical mini-chapters. They really are mini. There's only content on about two thirds of the pages, with almost 1 of every six blank before a full-page ""chapter"" heading, leaving 4 for quotes and, uh, witty? repertoire.That's the problem. It's just not that funny. The quotes themselves are okay. Not the best. And not the most popular or well-known or even telling. A bunch to which Volk can reply with short quips that may or may not been intended to be funny - I couldn't tell.On the other hand, it's quick mindless read that can be read in 30 second stops over a few days without doing great harm or causing great waste. And there do appear be people who found it humorous. I'm just not one of them. I don't think you will be either."
1,Where's the screw ?,"This weight is probably great, but I wouldn't know. I took it to Baja and then discovered the detail that you have to have a special screw to attach it to the bottom of the Sealife DC500. It would have been nice if they had included it in the package."
4,Authentic and direct,I love Mimi Paris's authentic and direct style mixed with lots of good humor and common sense. Her book is a nice guide to a successful life beginning with each of us taking responsibility for our own lives.
4,A wonderful map to follow,"This book looks small, but it is a powerful guide to rethinking the map you are following through life. It is the book that will never leave your night stand, and you will not share with others. But, you will want to buy everyone you know their very own copy to treasure!"
3,"Complicated, can't set a weekly schedule","So far, I've had this for a couple of months and it has been reliable. It could be a lot better, though. First, the programming is complicated and not intuitive. There is no way to tell what program you've created, so you have to reset it and start over if you want to make sure. Also, there should be something to indicated whether you've turned the program on or off--you have to turn it off if you want to open the valve for any reason, like using the hose for another purpose. Then, you have to turn the program on again if you want it to be active, but there's no simple way to look and see if the program is on or off. One other issue--if your city is on a weekly water schedule, this timer can't be programmed that way. The only options for watering are daily, every other day, and every three days."
4,Nice Installment on the Bolo series,"I've always enjoyed most of the Bolo stories, and I enjoyed this one particularly. It continues the story of Unit 28/G-179-LAZ and Maneka Trevor."
4,pratical use,"A nice book to understand the dynamics and consequences of pruning, and the templates are editable for other optimizing pursuses"
5,Cute movie,"Cute movie. Bought this for my son, we have all the movies to this...good story line, funny, even for the WHOLE family ;)"
3,A Little Better Than The First,"Unlike the first Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie, the filmmakers were a little more brave this time around and strayed further away from the book. My main problem with the first movie was that EVERY joke and scene was from the book, and they often wern't exectued as well as they should have been. Rodrick Rules improves, but it still needs work. This time around, Greg is trying to impress Holly Hills and sometimes the movie turns a bit absurd. For instance, the party scene from the book goes WAY too far in the movie. I also thought the church scene was way too unrealistic. It's okay, though, and the story can be described as ""heartwarming"". Not a bad rental for families."
4,Very good!,"This is not a film that grown ups are immediately drawn to. However, It was sweet, thoughtful and Oh So Funny! The family characters were all fully developed and very well acted! I'm glad my 10 year old talked me into seeing it! It was great to laugh together!"
4,Kids loved it!,"This is the third ""Diary of"" movies we've watched as a family. Really well done, funny, and parents can even relate."
1,not for us...,I struggled with the books because the behavior of the kids in them is not how I want my kids to act. The movie takes it up a notch and makes it more real. We watched for 10 minutes and turned it off. No thanks.
1,DIARY OF A WIMPY KID,DIARY OF A WIMPY KID; RODRICK RULES...SOUND VOLUME VERY LOW..COULD NOT HEAR IT.....WASTED MONEY TO RENT....WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS FILM.
4,DVD for Grandson,Could not find this in any local stores in our area. Glad that it was available at Amazon! He enjoys the DVD very much.
1,The worst customer service ever,I chose Virgin Mobile thinking they would be a good company. I have never been treated so rudely by customer service people in my life. In multiple conversations and speaking to numerous people I never got the same answer twice. It was a nightmare.I ended up throwing away the phone and losing my money. I feel stolen from.I would never do business with this company again. Huge mistake in the first place.
2,OK: Impressive ocean scenes,The best things about this movie are the ocean scenes. It's hard to know how the directors got so many good shots of the sailors. I don't think they did a very good job of showing the isolation these sailors must feel. You almost got the sense this was a regatta in a small bay. I think this would be better with a stronger focus on the solitary nature of this tyoe of sailing.
4,nothing better than Creedence,"Just had to replace the old tape, CCR is at its best. Fogarty as usual is in true form..this is a blend of folk, classic rock..CCR at its best!"
3,Is this just recycling old material?,"After re-purchasing every Creedence album in the JVC 20 bit analog remaster format, I was upset when, lo and behold, the albums are released again with bonus tracks. First of all, I am still blown away by the sound of the JVC remaster, which I thought was vastly superior to any other method and actually tried to capture the ""bottom layers"" of vinyl that CD's simply lack. So is this the same, or did they re-remaster? Then I looked at the majority of the bonus cuts across the catalog and realized they're from Europe '71. Are these different versions than those on the already remasterd live disc, or are they the same? Should I buy the earlier albums again for the live '69 stuff only to find a new release of the entire Fillmore show down the road. What about the Booker T. stuff- why spread it across albums unless it's for profit? Should I feel like I'm being manipulated?"
1,ironic suicide,"I hated this movie. Yes, Yes, I know the ironic appreciation quotient is pretty high for this film. But to be perfectly honest, I cried after watching this film , because I knew I was an hour closer to death."
2,Not worth it,"You get exactly what you pay for with this printer. First of all, the black cartridges won't even allow you to print plain black text on half a pack of paper. Second of all, mine is basically useless after about a year of light use. When I try to print pages, it skips lines, and prints random colors instead of blue at times. My relatively new black cartridge is about half full, and I've used the cleaning tools that come with the software, with no luck.My advice: Pay a little extra for a better printer. It'll be well worth it in the end."
1,Cheap for a reason -- It doesn't like paper,"At first I was happy to be able to purchase a printer for such a low price. However, the price should be even lower for this pile of junk. Every time I attempt to print, I spend several minutes trying to feed it paper. The printer will intake several pieces of paper at the same time instead of just one, and it will jam up. Even if I just feed it one piece of paper at a time, it will often still jam on just one piece of paper. Printing should not be this hard. These problems have occurred since I first purchased the printer. I regret purchasing this printer, as I should have went with a higher end model. I've lost respect for HP products because of the poor quality of this printer."
4,Great entry level printer,"This printer has been a marvelous purchase. Prints well and clearly.My only complaint is it is loud. Other than that, it is a great printer for the money I paid for it."
3,"nice ring, but a little lackluster","The ring is at a great price and was delivered very quickly. I love the design and the overall look of it. However, after less than two months of wearing it, it's already lost it's shine on some parts. When I contacted Peora, they told me that the rhodium plating was probably coming off. Their solution was to talke it to a local jeweler to either have it replated or to have the rest of the rhodium taken off. I'm not sure what the cost of the repair will be yet, but I felt that Peora should have offered to either replace or repair it themselves, especially since such a short amount of time had passed."
2,Not what I expected,"It's an ok bumper, but it's not very high quality. I've only had it a couple months and some of the ties have already ripped off. And it's not very sturdy, it did not prevent my son from sticking his hands and feet out the rails so I would definitely not recommend this if you are looking for something to keep your child safe."
3,Read the book but hope for better things,"Well I am a total fan of Roswell, I read the Roswell High Books and Loved them. SO I was totally excited when this series came out. This was not a bad book but I think that Mr. Cox should have done better research. The characters just didn't have the same feel as they did on the show. They did a lot of uncharacter-like things. The plot was also a bit sketchy. I still recommend this to anyone who loves Roswell. I can't wait to see how the next one is. Hopefully they will have the characters act more like themselves. Also, if you like Tess (I love to hate her) you'll be disappointed by the fact that she never makes an appearance. Neither does anyone like Sheriff Valenti or Kyle. It's just the regular six. Like I said though, read this book, but pray that the next author does a better job."
3,wonderful book!,"this book, Like all ROswell things, was wonderful, if you are a huge Roswell fan you should read this book."
2,Loose Ends does not portray characters well.,"I was really looking forward to this book and perhaps had my expectations way too high. I was disappointed in the authors portrayal of the characters. I did not feel he did a good job in doing so. The book picked up a bit about 1/4 of the way through, but getting there was difficult. What tells me how much I like or dislike a book is how quickly I read it. If I really like it, I'll read it in one day. If I sort of like it, it will take me two to three days. It took me two weeks to read this book."
4,Roswell Rocks,"This is a must have for fans of the Roswell High books and the TV series, although some of the Roswell info may be wrong its a really great book! I loved the way it was written and the storyline rocked! =0)"
4,Good for the price,"I had electronic express install this for me and it has been working great. No bells or whistles, just a remote start and keyless entry. I do wish the remote made an audible noise when you start your car. As it is right now it is a little difficult to know if your car has started or not if you aren't close enough to the vehicle to hear the engine fire up. The range is good, I have started my car from a 100 yards away with little or no obstructions in the way. Overall I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone not wanting to spend a lot of money but still want remote start and keyless entry."
2,"Good dustpan, impossible-to-remove sticker","Not shown in the picture is a huge, 4"" x 6"" sticker that comes on the dust pan that is of the cheap, never-comes-off-in-one-piece type. It is put on in such a way that you really have to remove it to use the item. Its just a dustpan, but if you make something with a sticker that is meant to be removed before use, you should really use a sticker that actually can be removed.Otherwise, nice dustpan."
4,"Inclusiveness, not separatism","This movie was very interesting and visually entertaining. I don't know much at all about how Muslims live, so in addition to the story, I enjoyed looking at the set, the costumes, the behavior. Sure, the acting was a bit clumsy at times, and the plot was quite obvious. There are other points that might not be really polished, but it's not a big budget, cast of thousands production.As obvious as the joke was about avoiding an arranged marriage by pretending to be ultra-observant when the suiter is more Westernized, it was still hilarious.The belly dancing was very nice; I really enjoyed that.Most of all, I liked the message: open your minds, include others, explain your situation, share your problems with those who love you. They're likely to understand and help."
2,This is most certainly teen writing. . .,"Those who like this book haven't read good fiction before. I thrive on good fiction, and I didn't thrive on this. I was bored throughout it and didn't feel anything towards the characters or the stories, and if my emotions aren't involved, I might as well be reading something factual.The writers are definitely inexperienced, and the ideas are dull and lifeless, the characters don't have very much depth, the storylines start boring and end that way. As a teen writer and reader, I think the stories were poorly chosen. There is much better teen writing out there.For those who want a good story to read, don't buy this book. It's not worth your time. Instead, buy something written by an experienced, adult writer that knows what they're doing."
2,Not so great.,"I was very disappointed. Chet is barely heard over all the other instruments.Would not recommend this CD if you are just ""getting into"" Chet's music."
1,A waste of money,The second Melnor electronic timer just died on me. It got flooded from the inside after three months of use. Water pressure was within spec and low temps were nowhere near freezing. I'll be looking for a different brand.
1,only one outlet is controlled by the timer,"This may be a great timer, but the specifications on Amazon say nothing to the effect that only one of the outlets is timed! The other is manual. So they get an extra $15 for the extra outlet. Quite a rip off. Also, there is a little wireless symbol (with the word ""wireless"" printed under neath). Yet nothing in the instruction manual indicating what this means."
3,A mixed bag,"The good: This is by far the most flexible timer I could find. I have not had any problem with battery life. I ran the timer every day during the spring and summer and it lasted until the next season.The bad: I second the notion that the plastic hose connector is a bad design. I have three of these timers and one of them sprung a leak after only a year of use. Another drawback is that the programming interface is not intuitive. I have bungled the programming on more than one occasion, and in one case I was able to create a watering schedule that was scheduled to water on no days! What good is that? Another problem is that one of my timers got water inside and damaged the display. It is still readable, but obviously it wasn't watertight."
4,very cost effective product,"I've had 2 of these timers for several years. not only do the 2 AA batteries last a full year, i figure i've saved hundreds of dollars over their lifetime in wasted water. they are versatile, inexpensive and highly functional. i won't duplicate the functions here, since others have detailed the capabilities. i will say however that they are a real ""time-saver"" and ""money-saver""! Programming is a bit tedious but otherwise, i love mine!"
3,good for warranty period,This timer worked great until 1 year after warranty was up. After that wasn't able to program or water manually. Something like this should last longer. I only use it for 5 months out of the year.
1,It broke. Six of them broke.,"Maybe it's me, but they all broke, and AMAZON returned my money, and I didn't even have to send back the remains. But now AMAZON should drop the product. There's a similar item with metal hardware that seems better. Available at Amazon."
1,Dont buy this,"It got rupture on day one. This is not at all good. Dont buy this, instead look for metal one."
2,Melnor Timer Flies Apart,"The timer would not hold any pressure at all, and when water pressure was applied the inlet popped out of the housing. The unit operating pressure is rated up to 100 PSI, and my pressure is less than half that. Regardless of the pressure, this unit would fly apart based on its construction. The inlet is simply pressed into the housing, and this type of smooth fitting into a larger fitting will not hold any pressure."
5,Easy to use. Grass looks great.,I had another timer that was incredibly difficult to program. The Melnor 3060 is much easier to set up. The preset programs were very helpful. I also like the fact that I don't have to take it off the faucet when I want to wash the car.
4,Too many outlets for me.,This timer works great. It was easy to set up and use. I already have a multiple outlet faucet so the untimed outlet was redundant for me. My last timer blew off the pipes and left just the connector attached. I use this with a drip system and it's great.
2,There are better options,"I have owned 3 of these Melnor timers and must say that they are quite flexible. But they are not intuitively easy to program and they suffer from the major flaw in faucet timers - a plastic connection to the faucet. Over time, the connection will loosen and water will leak into the unit and cause it to fail for any number of reasons including rust, battery corrosion, etc.Simply stated, never buy a faucet timer that doesn't have a brass connection to the faucet. I have had good luck with Orbit timers and they provide a 4 year warranty on at least some of their models."
2,Disappointing hot weather performance,"I bought this timer over others, the day before yesterday because of its ability to water on odd days. However, I have it attached below my south facing house wall faucet which is in direct sunlight for the majority of the day. I discovered the first day that the display became jumbled and the controls became inoperative when the unit had been in the sun for a modest period of time. Today, the unit was completely inoperative and required that I cool it down with hose water before it ""came back on line."" Worse, it had lost its time even though it didn't loose either program I'd stored. So, even if it did come to function again over night, it wouldn't know what time it really was! The manual gives no indication that the unit will not operate reliably at high temperatures although it does say it'll fracture if frozen. The manual lists no placement restrictions or options to avoid unit malfunction at higher temperatures."
4,Portrayal of an Era,"The Orphan Game was an interesting portrayal of American life during the early 1960's, before the societal shift of that era really occurred. Two fundamental themes are developed through the two central, and most-developed, characters of this book. Maggie, a 16-year-old, becomes pregnant just as her boyfriend ships off to Vietnam. She must grow up fast, and learn to deal with life on her own, without her family. Her father, Jim, is obsessed with the American dream and making life good for his family. These two characters obviously come into conflict, and it is through this conflict that Maggie eventually develops her own voice, outside of her family and her boyfriend.Darby's writing is phenomenal, and the writing dense and evocative. Overall, the book is well recommended."
3,"'I sometimes feel that I am but a thought, A piece of thistledown, a thing of naught'","This is a story like no other, and it certainly grabs you, even as you're reading the prologue, with the foretaste of an adventure that precludes the narrator from returning to his hometown...It's extremely humorous in parts. I loved Constance Hargreaves with her parrakeet and Bedlington terrier, her harp and her hip bath (a gift from the late Mr Archer.) And her nonsensical verses published in 'The Wayside Bundle'.But I felt the whole thing went on too long. As it became more serious, I was struggling to work out if the author was trying to put across a deeper message. Especially as the background is of a cathedral town - does Miss H (created and destroyed by will) represent faith in some way? Or is it just a humorous/ fantasy book?Wouldn't read it again, but it's certainly memorable."
2,"Not horrible, but you can find better!","Initially, I was excited by this set thinking that it contained both upper- and lower-case letters. It does not. Also, for those who have just a stopper in the tub, these shapes are small enough to go down the drain.These aren't so bad, it's just that they are not so good. Larger pieces, both letter types, less distracting print (if any) are what I plan to look for in my next set of bath letters."
2,Not worth the trouble!,"I bought the unit because it was suppose to be adjustable to the size you wanted to water. You can adjust the three outside holes to squirt or not in order to narrow the watering area. You can adjust the amount of water pressure to shorten the distance and, you can adjust the amount of oscillation to control the range of the watering. The problem is, these things only work as long as the unit oscillates. If you cut down on the water flow it stops oscillating. Of course, it always waits until you get back inside the house before it stops so when you look and it's not oscillating, you don't know how long it has been stopped. On occasion, it even stops oscillating with a full flow of water so you really have to keep an eye on it. Not worth the trouble."
5,Water flow control really makes a difference...,"I had bought the 4100 model (which doesn't have adjustable water flow control) from Home Depot. It was a great sprinkler but I couldn't get it to work in the small areas of my yard even with turning off the three sprinklers on each side.I was skeptical that the 4200 model with water flow control would make that much of a difference, because I figured I could simply control flow at the faucet. Thankfully I was wrong! I turn up the water pressure at the faucet, turn down the water flow at the sprinkler and it works beautifully in even the smallest areas. Continues to oscillate just fine even when doing a small 4'X 6' patch of grass."
1,Junk.,"Ray ""Red Devil"" hit the nail right on the head. This sprinkler stalls all the time, but for me it didn't matter what I set the flow rate at. It quits oscillating at full throttle and my water pressure is not low. I have two and they behave the same.I like the concept. It's wonderfully easy to adjust compared to the traditional oscillating sprinklers, but this product is engineered badly. One has to wonder if they ever do any design verification testing on their products. They certainly couldn't have done much on this piece of junk."
1,Oscillating? Hah!,"As everyone else has mentioned, this train wreck of a sprinkler only oscillates while you are watching it and then gets stuck. Regardless of water pressure and settings on the sprinkler. if you buy this product after reading these reviews, well, then good luck to you."
1,sorry I bought one,"This sprinkler worked fine for a few months but then stopped oscillating. The adkusment wide/narrow has become difficult to adjust, too. The all plastic seemed like a good concept for corrosion, but thais all. I wouldn't recommend it. I an going to see what the company days, but I would never buy another melchor product."
2,Oscillation malfunctions,"I bought three of these sprinklers, because I really liked how you can adjust the spray pattern. Unfortunately, they only lasted about two years and then the oscillation mechanizium failed on my sprinklers. I'd come out to find the spray pattern had stuck and failed to go back and forth.I'd pass on this sprinkler."
1,NOT as described!,"I ordered two fitted sheets for my twins' toddler beds. I have never been more disappointed with a product. They are clearly hand-made, not even close to retail quality- and I could do better! I cannot believe the incredibly POOR quality of these sheets. I'm actually amazed that they can even be sold on Amazon!! I wish I could attatch pictures!"
4,Entertaining enough trash novel,"I bought this book because the movie looked good and I like to read the book before I watch the movie. Ok, really what pushed me over the edge to purchase was the review about how awful the dialogue between the doctor and the gangs was. Oh, and it was awful! I was certainly entertained. I did not find it too technical as others complained. I didn't like the ending much. I felt like the first half of the story had momentum, then the author never took the story as far as it could have gone. I'd recommend this book only as what it is: an airport read for when you don't want to think too much and want a little action. While I usually go for something a little deeper, I did enjoy reading this. The four stars is because it was somewhat entertaining, and is not related to quality of writing. I'd read another of these when I want to rest my mind.Update - I have now seen the movie. The movie is NOTHING like the book."

4,A PROFESSION WITH BOUNDARIES,"The film builds the character of Father John Buerlein (Jeremy Sisto) very quickly and cleverly by showing us how easily and sometimes glib he deals with the problems of his parish. When a lonely prostitute confesses she plans on killing herself on her birthday, Father John is shaken out of his comfort zone. He enters into a Hollywood version of a seedy street underground filled with stock characters in attempt to find and save this woman.With the help of a savvy librarian, Father John gets a crash course on prostitution, one that most fifth graders know from watching TV. His attempt to save this woman causes John to interface with various people in the circle of life. The film is a character study of Father John who goes outside of the boundaries of his profession in order to help someone. Slow moving drama for those who like a heart warming story on redemption.F-bombs, no sex, background nudity."
3,Good Sound But Design Problems,I have these speakers for use as the left/right rear and center rear of a surround sound system which includes Wharfdale 8.3 speakers in the front and center roles.The sound seems to be fine and they are well made. I have two reasons why I can't recommend them tho:They really aren't powerful enough to fit in a system that includes bigger front speakers. The 8.3s drown them and they aren't monster speakers by any stretch. I have tried all of the settings.suggestions on my excellent Yamaha Amp to redress this without success. Any suggestions JBL? Anyone?The product specific speaker stands are poorly designed. The stands and poles look cool but the specifically designed cable clips are flimsy and fall off at the slightest provocation. A redesign to use a tubular support which the cable can go inside would be desirable. Be aware than these speakers are not compatable with any other generic speaker stand.
1,Helpful but Not Entirely Practical nor Complete,"While this booklet provided a good outline for our LLC to begin its discussions, it was not nearly complete enough to prevent complicated legal problems faced down the road and at the conclussion of the LLC. I highly recommend that ever group that is not simply a husband & wife type of operation seek professional legal advise and have the LLC set up with proper formal legal documents. It will save a lot of hard feelings AND MONEY in the long run."
5,Great,"Very nice blade, knife fits like a glove inside the axe. Super durable and I would totally recommend this product for camping etc."
2,OK I guess. Not very practical.,"As an avid outdoorsman I can't endorse this product because it doesn't satisfy my main criteria: Would you stake your life on this? NO!I really don't like plastic. I don't like the blade, the handle, the ""saw"" or the sheath. This is another case of ""I used to like this vendor"".The saw is a big serrated knife and is almost useless fo cutting wood thicker than your thumb. A collapsible camp saw is infinately better and can cut logs. There's no way I would carry this in my pack because it's not worth the weight. It's going into the car trunk for good."
1,Do not buy,"This Hunters Specialties Johnny Stewart's Attractors is a complete waste of money. I just used it for the first time coyote hunting and good thing I took my other callers. First off the remote control range is no 100' it is like 20' at max, second I can hardly hear it at 20' away so how is a coyote going to here it from any further lol. This is very disapointing buy and feel miss lead on the discription. Save you money and dont buy this. However Johnny Stewart had great calls just not this one. So do not hold this agians that brand, every company has a bad apple now and then. JUST THIS CALLER IS junk......."
3,Worked great for a while,"I used this caller for a while and never got it wet. Then within a year, it broke, I swapped batteries, but no go.Barring that, when it worked, it worked great. I had probably 30 crows in my yard using the caller, 7 crow decoys and a plastic owl."
5,works grea,tried it out starting with howl and used rabbit and seems to drive all the yotoes crazy . didn't get a clear shot maybe next time
4,Call and they will come.,"First time we went out, we called in two coyotes. This was both fun and exciting. It is well worth the price."
1,Beware of 70X speed performance... IT'S NOT REAL !!!,"I tried this card in several digital cameras and compared it with my current ""good old normal speed"" 128MB CF cards that I bought 4 years ago !!! and there was no speed increase... even worst, sometimes it took a bit longer than the cards I had. AVOID buying this card. If you believe it's going to perform faster, IT WON'T !!! it's just another plain 128MB CF card."
2,Be Forewarned,"This may be a great movie. It may not. I never found out because about 20 minutes into it the extreme profanity forced me to turn it off.It is unlikely that five seemingly respectable young men in a high-end prep school in 1941 would swear so flippantly and constantly as these young men do. I think it was very unnecessary for the screen-writers to incorporate such language and tarnish a potentially good movie.But, if you can stomach d-, h-, sh- and the like about every 15 seconds, by all means. Watch this movie. It might be an otherwise great movie depicting the civilian reaction to the attack on Pearl Harbor, but be forewarned, it is NOT a family movie, and it does NOT deserve the PG rating."
2,Pretty but impractical,"My mom purchased this for my daughter and it is every bit as beautiful as it looks online. I was very excited to pull it out and wash it up...until I found out that everything, including the fitted sheet, is dry clean only. I don't have time for that, so we returned it."
1,NOT WHAT YOU THINK,"This bedding will look nothing like the picture once you get it! It is very GOLD! It has more of an Asian look to it than a shabby shik/country look. The picture doesn't show any gold in it, but that is the majority of the color! I sent it right back and had to pay to ship it back, be 100% sure you like it....I hated it once it got here!"
4,Did what it was supposed to do,I put this in my car for winter storage. It appears to be a worthy product. I will know more in the spring when I bring out the car and see how it fares over the winter. I may love it then but time will tell.
4,"Light & Small, but it projects time to ceiling.",Base ball type round ball timer and projector works well. It is operated by 2 AA batteries for time keeping and time projection is by AC power cord.This was the least expensive ceiling projection clock I could find. Ordering process and delivery was easy and prompt. It serve for my purpose.
4,Good Bowl,"Its a plastic cat bowl, not much to be said. I like how the bottom of this is curved instead of having corners, its much easier for my cats to get in and finish all the food."
3,funnest toy ever,"well the first 6 times i went on it, it was SOOOOOOO fun! but not after a while i noticed a HUGE tear on the bottom. i took some duck tape and taped it up. it worked temporaraly, but then there was a little tear still so i took more tape and i taped it and it worked! it held for 3 months before i used mor duck tape.. it was still very fun over all."
4,Extremly fun but not at all durable,"A very fun toy, if you plan to use it only one day. It ripped where the hose was attached. The tunnel just didn't work and was a hinderance to the kids when slidding. It was fun while it lasted, ..."
4,Genuine Brand Nothing Special,"I would recommend a generic brand over the name brand xerox version. It works well but in no way stands out from comparable generics. I'd look at other brands and strongly consider saving some money by going generic. Think of it like prescription drugs, generic works the same and is far less expensive."
3,"Interesting, but it needs work","I'll admit I haven't seen very much of this, but it definitely has an interesting premise. It is very Aztec, has lots of fighting, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Definitely better than the ""Fist of the North Star"", but it doesn't compare well to things like ""Record of Lodoss War""."
2,SO? WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT??,"I RECENTLY TRIED TO 'GET THROUGH' VOLUME 1 OF LAWRENCES SHORT STORIES. I LOVE HIS WRITING. IT'S BEAUTIFUL AND FILLED WITH WILD SENSUAL IMAGES. HOWEVER, WHEN I FINISH EACH STORY, I WONDER: SO WHAT??? WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT??? EACH STORY SEEMS TO BE SIMPLY A SLICE OF LIFE, MANY DEALING WITH MAN/WOMAN RELATIONSHIPS. BUT AT THE END OF EACH, I DID NOT FEEL THAT I HAD LEARNED OR GAINED ANYTHING FROM THE READING. ALSO, MOST DID NOT HOLD MY ATTENTION - EXCEPT FOR THE BEAUTIFUL USE OF LANGUAGE AND SENSE IMAGERY."
1,cutting edge,"We have used gardena garden tools for a long time,easy to use with limited tools for assembly if required. the hedge trimmer cut our trimming time in half as it cut effortlessly. we also enjoy the snap on hose attatchments. when will you make gardena power cords? i have played with this thought for quite some time, it would be great to have snap on power ends that are waterproof, never having to worry about pull aparts, or weather, i bet it would be a hit for industrial and home use.i have submitted this idea to ics, but you are the company that could make it work."
5,Good info,"Really not sure why one reviewer felt the need to grandstand about northern racism...this book does exactly what it says, and is a valuable resource."
1,BIG Disapointment,"Big DisappointmentI am normally a big fan of this author's historical romances but her mysteries leave much to be desired. Poor character development and worse plot. The heroine is supposedly an intelligent woman and yet she doesn't even know the most basic of information about the man she has supposedly loved all her life, her grandmother and her own mother! Did this women never ask a question when she was growing up!? The story lines involving her brother and friends are weak and very contrived.It's a bad sign when halfway through the book I STILL don't care who did what or why. Read some of her older books like One Wore Blue, One Wore Gray and One Rode West, but do yourself a favor and stay away from her mysteries."
3,I'm a teacher and I still haven't figured out how to use these..,"I bought this set thinking it would be a useful tool to use during class for my students, however, I still haven't figured out how I'm going to do that!!! Most of the words on the cards are not very useful to a beginning student or someone who is just learning Italian before a trip, the content is just not very practical. However, if you're serious about learning, having flash cards may be a good tool to acquire vocabulary. I would suggest making your own flash cards because these are very small, in black & white, and the quality of the paper is not going to last. I don't think the price justifies this product.Also, I don't understand why they didn't keep the adjectives & adverbs separate, they could've done that instead of mixing them up, which may cause confusion.I find the ones on Verbs more useful because you'll also see the conjugation."
3,Look for kits,"The product is ok, but considering the price, I would suggest to look for toolkits which offer more bang for the buck."
2,mmmm...,"I did not like it, it was difficult to assemble and its not as sturdy as I would like it to be."
1,Sucks,It sucks. To flimsy to even put up. I am returning it. As soon as I opened the box I know this would not last the summer.
3,back board,item is okay for the price. I'd thought it be made stronger than it is and the mounting bracket it shows to buy with it isn't quite made for it. i had to drill holes to modify it a little
3,INCOMPLETE BOOK,"ALTOUGH IT IS A VERY COMPREHENSIVE BOOK IN CANCLESTICKS AND FIBBS, IT ALWAYS REFERS TO A CERTAIN SOFTWARE THAT SHOULD COME ENCLOSED TO THE BOOK IN A CD, WHICH IT DOES NOT . THE BOOK CITES THE SOFTWARE FOR A WHOLE CHAPTER AND IMPLIES CERTAIN ANALYSIS TO THE USE OF THE REFERRED SOFTWARE THAT THE READER DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS."
2,Review of SRA Math Explorations,"I am not impressed. The format is very dry and the practice problems are quite repetitive (use of the same numbers over and over). The problems are also, in my viewpoint, very simplistic. This might be a good book for a child really struggling in math, but I think most kids will be bored out of their minds."
3,Sea Shells of the United States and Canada,I only speak a good french and I don't know what to do here !
1,Please see other 1-Star Review,"This movie stinks! I was going into this expecting to see something very original and rewarding, but what I got was a dud...a BIG FAT DUD! I yawned so much my eyes were watering and my jaw was aching! Everything I have to say about this piece of crap was already stated by the first 1-star reviewer. Please see all the good points as to why this movie is a stinker in that review!'Nuff said!Granny's Star Factor: 1[..] Star *"
4,ORIGINAL,"It seems in the not to distant future there won't be much lighting so everything will appear to be made of stainless steel. The movie combines a Dirty Harry wannabe with the eye clamps of Clockwork Orange and the Neural Neutralizer from Star Trek. The story runs for a long time with a plot and subplot that seem very disconnected, annoyingly so, but hey they are French. I was confused by one translation which went something like ""I was summoned to the investigation, tomorrow."" Apparently they used some type of word for word translation. The main character was written rather poorly. He was the tough cop we had to identify with, but instead he got kick around a lot, had many character flaws, and was not likable. The plot took priority over any kind of significant character development to the point it took away from the movie (not as bad as 2001). I won't say a word about the plot, as it is in part a mystery, and to say anything would spoil it. The movie is original and worth a peek."
4,Shivers with Michael,"A great double. I love the first since the second has little to do with Michael Meyers unless it would be the ""Halloween"" or Samhain connection."
5,A God-centered approach to the Sabbath,"This book belongs on the shelf of every Christian's library. Pipa does a wonderful job communicating the theology of the Sabbath, which needs to be done more in Christendom. The Sabbath has not been abrogated, as so many Christians purport. It has been fulfilled in Christ, but the principle of its keeping is perpetual. Pipa addresses key Scripture which others use to show the Sabbath's abrogation, such as Col. 2 and Heb. 4. (He could also use Mt. 24:20 to punctuate his argument.)Pipa explores the meaning of Is. 58:13,14 to show how the Sabbath day is to be observed. He shows it's not a day to delight is ourselves, but is to be solely Christ-focused, with works of mercy and necessity.If you are a Christian, don't let this book pass you by! It's very readable and non-technical."
4,Nice DVD. I just wish there were more moves in it.,Nice DVD. I just wish there were more moves in it.
3,Too dark to write on,"We received this as a gift and LOVE it for its beautiful visual appeal. However, it's very hard to find ink that shows up on the dark background. I've tried gold and silver markers, and then when those didn't show up very well, I tried writing over them with thinner black lines, but that doesn't show up well either. Also my son pulled it down, and the ribbon pulled out from the backing paper. I was able to fix it with superglue, but it still should be designed well enough that a toddler can't break it by pulling on it, which toddlers will be bound to do. Still, my children absolutely love the looks of this chart, and I really appreciate the thoughtful gift."
1,Not Useful,If you want to learn about shaders then look elsewhere because you're not going to learn how to write your own shaders with this thing. This book seems to be more of a quick reference. It also seems to be slanted heavily towards vertex shaders with little information about pixel shaders.
3,not too much fun,"i got these for my boys for christmas. but they have not really played with them. they love ninja turtles and play with all of there turles excpet for these. the scorpion is difficult to get the turtle in, and just really a pointless toy. glad i only paid 7.99, not worth more than that."
4,"Great pictures and examples, no nonsense language","This is a very nice overview of lean, or ""just in time"" as this was referred to in 1988 when this book was published. There are many great ""before and after"" examples in the book that illustrate many lean principles. There are nice diagrams that show how the different lean tools fit together and support each other. Downsides to the book are that the pictures from Japan (with kanji character signs), which might turn off people in some American factories, and some terminology issues (what's commonly called ""takt time"" is referred to as ""cycle time"" in this book, which might cause confusion). I have dozens of lean books, but enjoy this book for the historical context (it's a very early lean book) and for the specific examples and lessons I can learn from in my plant's lean efforts."

5,Much more well made than I imagined,"Usually, you buy a flag online and think ""Well, maybe it will last a few months."" Something with thin material and not very colorfast. Not this flag. We took it out of the package (my wife's a huge Bears fan) and wow! The sticking around the letters, the bear, and the seams are heavy. We will have this flag for a very long time before it ever wears out."
4,decent shoe,"I've worn skate shoes off and on for years, although I don't skate. I've worn Sketchers for a while because they are fairly cheap and are durable. These shoes are no exception. My only complaint is the thickness and flatness of the sole. I almost thought I had shape-ups at first. the shoe has a nice snug fit and much more support than the Airwalks or Vans I used to buy."
4,Cheap and very comfortable,"I think I paid less that $20 back in 2005. I wear it to work and haven't used for skating (I don't skaeboard). anyways, it's more comfortable than some of the more expensive dedicated comfort shoes. there is one thing that bothers me though and that is shoelace ring that can be felt on your foot can be bothersome."
4,neatnix,"Arrived quickly. Most reasonably priced for discontinued item only available on-line. Although not past the expiration date, it tastes a bit stale and bitter than I remember when I got it direct from Whole Foods."
3,Somewhat Dissapointed,"Although I realized it was an interface for the headunit, I didn't expect to be so limited with my control. It was rather disappointing. It was very difficult to control anything via headunit and I found myself spending hours searching for a song. Eventually I found it easiest to select a playlist before hand and then just plug it in from there. The interface then resumes the song to whatever it was playing onto the headunit. This was the only real way to control what I was listening to. The only real thing I liked about it was the fact that the volume didn't fluctuate as with aux inputs do. I also liked the fact that it charged the ipod. Other than these two reasons, I would stick to an RCA to AUX setup with a car charger or if you dont need your ipod charged as often, RCA to ipod."
5,Easy to Use,"This interface is really easy to use, just plug it in your receiver, and you`re good to go!"
4,Good product,The item came quickly and worked perfectly. Good buy for anyone wanting to hook there ipod up to there car stereo system.
4,Excellent kung fu movie.....,"i loved this movie....being that im a kung fu movie fan and own many movies i was glad to have enjoyed this film so much....excellent remastering, the picture and sound is awesome...well acted movie with a great great story line...i wont give it 5 stars but pretty damn close...ill throw it a 4.5 tho"
3,Cute!,This is a cute plush toy. As such it has no major education value nor is it exceptionally durable. But it was exactly what my granddaughter wanted and she loves it. That makes it worth it in my book.
3,IMPRESSIVE BUT FLAWED,"THIS IS AN IMPRESSIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE WORK,BUT COULD BE MORE READER FRIENDLY.THIS BOOK SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN DONE IN TWO VOLUMES;ONE COVERING RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AND ANOTHER FOR COMMERCIAL/PUBLIC BUILDINGS.MY MAIN COMPLAINT HOWEVER IS THAT THE PHOTOGRAPHS AND PRINTING ARE TOO SMALL.AN OLDER PERSON LIKE MYSELF(60ish)HAS DIFFICULTY READING SUCH SMALL PRINT AND DEFINING DETAILS OF THE BUILDINGS IN PHOTOS AS PRESENTED.EVAN WITH THESE FLAWS IT IS STILL AN ENJOYABLE READ."
5,My 3 year old loves it!,"My son just got this for his 3rd birthday and he loves it. It's very easy to go from game to game. He needed some help at first, but now he does it all by himself. The games aren't too hard for him to play and keep his attention for quite a while. It's a great game to start with, especially if your child likes the Monster Clubhouse on Sesame Street. He got a few games for his birthday and plays with this one the most. He loves the Monster Clubhouse song at the beginning and the Goodbye song at the end."
1,junk,"I got two of these from my Thank you Points reward network..same lights. The one came with a screw shaking loose inside but the real problem is that these flashlights lasted one day. They no longer hold a charge and when they did...not very bright. They are not true battery free shake lights. You can see the 3 little button cell batteries inside..and these are what I think was giving me the little bit of light at first..Absolute junk..cheap plastic feel, switch is cheap..nothing quality about it. Came with a box with typos all over it..not address of the company. Do not wasted your time or money on this junk."
2,Cheap,It Fell apart when we opened it. We Put it back together but it isn't very well made. Not recommended.
1,Little light,"Light is much like a very small candle. Switch was broken when I receive this item, but it is not worth returning. Just something else to toss in the trash"
2,It sucks,"They work but barely,they aren't very bright at all, and after a couple years (no matter how much you shake it) you have to put your hand with-in a foot directly in front of it to see it. The only up side is that they do not need batteries, but the batteries in a standard flashlight will last longer than this flashlight."
4,fun,"I bought this for my Niece and Nephew. They really enjoy it, but my wife really liked it as well :)."
5,A Sweet Valentine for Lovers Everywhere,"This is not just another movie from a teen romance genre. It is a smart and realistic portrayal of a young woman falling in love for the first time. Nadia (Charlotte Valandrey) feels passionate about everything: Stalin, Apollinaire, Scarlett O'Hara and most of all for Stephane (Lambert Wilson). Her youth gives her the confidence for her passions, yet her naivete makes her feel lonely and misunderstood at times. Stephane gives her the acceptance she yearns for at home and at the pro-Communist groups.The onscreen chemistry of Charlotte Valandrey and Lambert Wilson, combined with first rate acting makes this movie one of the best romance movies EVER. It is by far the most under-rated movie I have ever come across. I can't believe there's no DVD available! Now, that's a travesty!"
3,Product Good...Shipping Bad,"I bought this product on Febraury 9th as a gift for my boyfriend. I paid for two day shipping so that I would recieve it a few days before Valentine's Day. Not only did I NOT recieve it in two days, I did NOT even receive it by Valentine's Day! The company blamed UPS and UPS blamed the company. Will never purchase from again!"
4,Good Device,Overall good device. I would advise any customer to inquire about where to get the correct usb cord for upgrading the maps on the device. Even though you can use an sd card to upgrade the maps. It can be quite annoying going back to your car and inserting the sd card seeing that the update didn't work.
2,Not a good purchase,"I am very frustrated with this printer and support from HP. If I had kept the original packaging, I would have sent it back long ago. The printer doesn't ""pull"" the paper properly so every sheet has a trail of black marks which renders it useless for anything you want to hand out. Secondly, the black ink blobs on the page. When I went to HP for help all they could say was, ""use another cartridge"". Since I was using a new cartridge straight from their manufacturer this also frustrated me. I've changed cartridges with no change in quality.If I were you, I'd look at another printer."
2,HP Deskjet 6940 Miserable,"I'm in college, and I can't print one document without a paper jam. Its very annoying to not only waste ink, but half a packet of paper and precious time trying to print off an assignment. Look elseware for a reliable, high volume printer."
1,Flawed (X-Bias spring flaw damages printer),"Because of a design flaw, there's a small plastic tab that holds the x-bias spring in place. When the tab breaks (notice I used the word when and not if), the spring will punch a hole in the circuit. As a result, my printer only does black and white.HP provides pictures of this problem. Look for ""Cannot Insert Print Cartridge"" and you'll see the image of the spring out of place. What it doesn't show is an image of the damaged circuit."
2,Will not fully work with Windows 7,Watch out if you have Windows 7. You can download the drivers from HP for Windows 7 and it also has a Windows 7 update too. Thing is is that the toolbox is not part of the Windows 7 and you can't align or clean the print heads at All! Don't know what HP is thinking?!
3,HP Deskjet 6940,"Had a problem getting the printer on line. Also, information for setting up the printer was not included. I have had to call HP 3 times to get the printer working properly."
2,poor durability,"Was a nice and fast printer, but died after only a few months. Was very happy with it until then. Quick, networkable, was good for our small office network. Alas, one day just had power and resume blinking at the same time. HP support unable to help much(went thru the whole diagnosing thing with them) and since out just barely out of warranty, had to trash it. Have several HP printers, all much older than this one, and they work just fine(have 820cse that is at least 10 years old), and even a couple of freebie printers that came with PCs have held up better than this."
2,ummm,Good printing quolity is only sample print.Big power adaptor and very short power cable.I never buy hp printer.
2,Nice looking printed page but temperamental in network mode.,"Prints a high precision page, but will goes into standby when cartridges are replaced. Disconnecting power cord does not help. The next day it will reset.Also, occasionally, this printer locks up and can only be reset by again disconnecting the power cord."
2,Frustrated...,"I currently have two of this particular printer in my office. I know that the printer works well and is exactly what I need. This printer, however, has worked just one day since I've had it out of the box. I've gone through various steps to try troubleshoot but without success. I purchased my other printers from Staples which I could easily make a return to if I had problems. I feel stuck with the non working printer with no real way to return it. In the future I would think twice. I guess I'm just frustrated."
4,Good Printer for Home,"I just received this printer. I find it performs well. It is not the fastest printer, but for home use it performs well."
3,HP Review,"HP failed to package the setup poster with the machine and no USB cables , I had to purchase USB Cables and download the setup poster"
1,Disappointed,"We bought this printer several months ago and have found it to be wanting in several areas. It runs through the black ink cartridge very quickly, it must be replaced weekly, very costly. And now it is pulling multiple sheets through at a time, a waste of paper and precious ink. I will not buy another HP printer."
5,HP bubble jet,"I have a used a similar HP printer (same 96 & 97 cartridges) for four years and I am very pleased with the reliability. The only problem is I live in a small town and Walmart does not carry HP printer cartridge number 97 here. There are some other stores in my town that sometimes carry this cartridge but usually, I have to drive 75 miles to the nearest big town."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought three of these last summer (2011). One went out within about two months. I put the other two out this year, and on one the timer has completely stopped working. On the last one it will not pass water unless I tap on the timer or on the sides to get the valve to open. None of them gave a full water flow at any time, even when new. The internal valve seems to just give out, and of course, the timers give out. I have had better luck with the Orbit timer."
1,"Sorry, but it is duhhhh ... broken","I bought this in the off-season and put it up on my shelf and sort of forgot about it. Now it's about time to start using it since it's getting hot down here in Atlanta. Hooked it up and noticed it had a hole in it. Leaks like crazy. Absolutely worthless to me. Of course, by now I've thrown away the box and the paperwork, so shame on me. Grief. Grief. Grief. Money down the drain."
1,"Breaks after 3 weeks, twice!","The first one I bought cracked (and started spraying water everywhere) after about 3 weeks of use. I emailed Melnor, and they shipped me a replacement. The second one cracked and started spraying water in (about) 3 weeks too! It cracked it a different place. Save your money. Do not buy this product."
2,Cheap plastic,"The timer worked okay. The plastic threaded part to which the hose attaches broke halfway through its second season. I've also had a Melnor oscillating sprinkler that broke after a couple of months (another cheap, plastic part), a Melnor reel hose that leaked like crazy from the day I bought it and a fancy Melnor rubberized brass nozzle that also leaked like crazy and wouldn't produce a decent spray pattern. No more Melnor products for me."
5,Simple fun for youngsters!,"The 3 in 1 Creativity Kit can provide hours of enjoyment for your younger kids. In addition to a large picture database, both the coloring book and paint box allow you to download pictures from other sites. Another bonus: the program is multilingual, including english, french, spanish, italian, and portugese! The three programs offered in the 3 in 1 kit provide hours of ""wholesome"" mess-free entertainment."
3,Mark Farner rocks in christian circles!!,Great blues rock from one of america's best rockers- also easy ballads that usher in the presence of God!!
2,Fantastic Content Incomprehensible Grammar,"The terrible grammar makes the difficult concepts impossible to comprehend. English is clearly not this author's first language and the editor did not bother to correct the author's blunders.This book might be extremely useful for someone that already has a strong understanding of the concepts that are being presented. However the often ambiguous, misleading and awkward grammar impedes (or prevents) comprehension of new concepts."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I had purchased these lights for my mother for her birthday on June 6, 2011; The vendor was wonderful. I ordered late, and he or she was able to have delivered to her front porch on time. My mom had enjoyed solar lights I had sent her on a prior time. At age 83 it gives her something to look at. My mom reported that the lights were beautiful, and even changed colors; shone brightly when she first got them. Now they no longer work (September 2, 2011). I suggested new batteries. Not her thing to do, as the prior light at a year were still running. So in her head, why should batteries be used up? These lights were used inside. Can indoor light, versus solar light effect the functioning of the solar cell? This information is all second hand. I am not looking for any adjustment, or anything. Like a floral arrangement they did last a month, bring her joy (she likes birds) and were not that costly."
5,Metal Church at their best,First off I can't see how anybody can give this a bad review. Second I know that people have their own taste as far as singers are concerned so I can understand in one way.But in my opinion I think Ronnie munroe is better than David Wayne by far. But I would have to say I like Ronnie Monroe as well as Mike Howe.The music on this album reminds me of the Mike Howe days and a little bit of the Masterpiece album.I think it is good fresh start for the band the new guys really compliments the music. I also think this album's song writings are better than the previous album Masterpiece. To me there seems to be more heart and energy in this album. With that being said I look forward to the future with the band and their new lineup.
1,waste of money,i received this book for Christmas i was a vanflower fan until i read her book..it lacks talent it is juvenile i wouldnt recommend it to anyonethe plot which is barley there drags and drags with no end in site and the end well its not surprising or impressive....disappointment cant express enough my dislike for this book..it is obvious why no big name publisher would back this piece of work...honestly i know teenagers who write better and by teenagers i use because of the lack of maturity this book has..
4,"A rocker's ""must have""","Awesome album! SIMPLE SOLUTION,NO MEAN CITY,JUST TO GET INTO IT and STAR are worth the price of the CD. Excellent rythym work by Zal and Manny,Dan's voice is in top form,Pete and Sweet got it cooking on this one. A ""must have""."
3,Great Cover art with som good songs,"I find it annoying not to see the track listing in ""IMPORT"" albums. So for the benefits of others who are like-minded, the original track listings (without bonus tracks"" are :1.JUST TO GET INTO IT2.MAY THE SUNSHINE3.SIMPLE SOLUTION4.STAR5.CLAIM TO FAME6.WHATEVER YOU WANT BABE7.WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME8.NO MEAN CITY (Part 1 & 2)I must say this album is one of NAZARETH's poorer efforts. ""May The Sunshine"" is BEATLES-like song but nevertheless catchy. ""NO MEAN CITY""- the title track is more like ""Iron Maiden""'s earlier works. Only shining track is ""Whatever You Want Babe"". And the rest of the tracks are uninspired and repetitive. So, unless you're serious and ardent fan of Nazareth or you like the cover art so much, give this album amiss."
5,Last of the Greatest,"Unfortunately, this is the last true hard rock album of a hard rock supergroup. I was a hard-rock virgin until that fateful day when my soon to be brother-in-law inserted an 8-track of ""Hair of the Dog"" into his 65 mustang. Nazereth changed my views on music forever. I now have all their albums in one form or another,except some of the ones released in the 90's as they just don't grab me the the way the old stuff does. Sure, there were signs of life after ""No Mean City"", but they were few and far between. This is the last great album by this band.(With 'Snaz being a glaring exception)This album has anthems, ballads, and heavy sounds, but it's all pure rock-n-roll. If you don't have this album in your collection, my friend, then you are not a rock-n-roller."
4,grating greatness,"If you love fresh ingredients, this nutmeg grater is a must. It stores the whole nutmeg and if you overgrate, there's even space to reserve a bit of grated nutmeg forthe next time."
4,Interesting!,"I have made an interesting observation! I was recently on a trip to South America Chile, Argentina and I stopped by a few bookstores on my travel looking for a book any book on the history of Israel in Spanish and I could find none! nada! nothing at all whether old or new. Therefore, how are all this south american countries currently recognizing the PA when they have no grasp of what is going on in the middle east!My search was deep I checked in large fancy bookstores as well as smaller shops and I found absolutely nothing on Israel as if the country doesn't exist.Martin Gilbert needs to get this book translated into Spanish and many other languages so as to get the story and message across. I also recommend he spread this message to other writers on the topic of Israel to do the same."
2,Not happy with this case.,"This case looks great and I love the clear plastic viewer and the ""kickstand."" However, the two flaws stated by other reviewers have also been a problem for me. I cannot yet use the Zen while it's in the case, and the adapter plug will not plug into the Zen while it is in the case. Why would I want a case that I have to remove every time I use the player? I have a silicone cover for my Zen V, which I like, but I bought the Forza case for my Vision because I wanted a more protective case. I will probably go back and buy a silicone cover."
4,About What I Expected....,"Good, sturdy case, secures the player very nicely. Swivel belt clip and stand are nice touches. The lanyard and metal loop at top seem somewhat superfluous; is anyone really gonna hang this behemoth around his/her neck or even wrist?Negatives: as others have said, you'll have to remove your player in order to plug in the Creative cable packaged with the player. This is somewhat nerve-wracking since the face of the player scratches so easily, but I haven't noticed any real problem yet. Also, the button markings painted on the face of the case don't quite match up to the player. The Shortcut button in particular is fairly far off the mark. Not a big deal, you just have to compensate.All-in-all, a good buy that has protected my player well thus far."
4,"Fun, simple primer","This is no heavyweight text, but then it is for beginners, not heavyweight Christians. It covers the basics of Christianity in a biblically reliable, easy-reading style. It is informative and, I think, fun for the curious."
4,Good for minor aches/pains,"I bought this for my husband, who has severe shin splints. He is a lightweight for traditional pain medications, and needed something to help get him through the day without spacing him out. So far, he has taken it at the height of the pain, and has only noticed minor relief. I imagine it would work a bit better if taken before the pain is unbearable. As with all Hyland's products, we love that it is able to be taken without water and doesn't have the obnoxious side effects found with most OTC medications. The package came quickly from the Vitamin Shoppe, and we were happy with the service overall. We plan to continue to purchase other Hylands products - including the Seasonal Allergy Relief (which we absolutely LOVE) and the Upset Stomach tablets (which have gotten me through a difficult pregnancy and occasional migraines w/ nausea)."
1,wrong product,I ordered Arnica Montana tablets. I was sent Ipecacuanha tablets. Not worth my time for hassle of replacement for 7.00 purchase! But! I would not purchase another itemfrom a company that sends wrong item!
5,Healing therapy,"I was first introduced this by the doctor who was going to operate on my face (Lifestyle Lift). I used it as directed, and within one week, I had absolutely no bruising, though right after surgery, it looked like I had gone face-first into a tree! I am now using it for a beautiful case of Shingles. Within a day, the pain was gone, and now, the spots are fading rapidly. Shingles, I have read, take 2-3 weeks to clear...mine has been only a week and a half. Amazing stuff. Remember, the tablets are SUB LINGUAL, and not to swallow."
2,Hoping for a product that works,"I have problems with the muscles in my legs ,was told about this item, hoping it would truly help me....maybe it does help some .but I may as well have been eating jelly beans...did not help me one bit..."
2,Technical Specifications are Erroneous,"My MIDLAND 21-406 Extension Speaker was delivered yesterday. Multiple websites, including MIDLAND's, stated it was an 8-ohm, 15W speaker. It is actually a 4-ohm, 20W speaker. MIDLAND admitted today (01/18/07) that the specifications were wrong and they were ""correcting"" the website. It's probably a good speaker, but 4-ohm vs. 8-ohm is important to many folks, especially me."
3,Not as Good as Expected,"This book has lots of good information, especially for people like me who are new to investor relations; however, the relentless repeated emphasis on the effects of the Sarbanes-Oxley act and the surprisingly poor editing of the book make it only mediocre. There are many mispellings and I found one paragraph to be duplicated word-for-word on the immediate subsequent page. Take this book back to the editors and then send it back out to the public..."
5,Must Read,"The Psoas Book opened my eyes greatly to this incredible muscle. I know the Psoas is an important muscle in anatomy, but the elements of emotion, function, and dysfunction put this muscle on the top shelf in terms of importance.After reading this book, I have taken a closer look at the Psoas in a variety of clients issues, and have found it implicated a multiple of times.Dont overlook this muscle and this imnortant book. Highly recommended."
1,Doesn't Hold Up,"When I first received this sprinkler and hooked it up I thought, ""wow, it works great and I don't have to remember to turn off the hose!"". Now a month later after several uses I hook it up again and it won't work. It won't work because the plastic ""peg"" that causes the sprinkler to oscillate is broken and cannot be fixed...because it's plastic. This is the part of the sprinkler that has to work the most and it's PLASTIC. I won't be purchasing another one because I cannot afford to replace one once a month."
5,You Go Girl!!!,"I think the other reviews are being too hard on Amel. No, she is not a Jazz Vocalist like Ella or Nina. But if you sit back and listen to the flava that Amel is putting into jazz, you would realize that she handled her business. I love this cd. I can think of a few that can pull this off (Zhane, Queen Latifah), but any other female artist could not hang with this type of jazz. I would highly recommend this for a candle lit dinner."
1,Not Helpful- Useless & Depressing Ramble,"The catchy title must have been developed AFTER the book was thrown together. It reads as a collection of misc. snippets from the authors sessions describing his patients various problems. Kort rambles on & eventually you'll have to look back at the chapter start page to see what it was supposed to be about- Kort never leads to a valid summary in any chapter. So I read the book thinking that somewhere in all this verbage I'll eventually find 10 things to improve my life, but... there aren't any. Not only was it a waste of time & $, the book left me depressed after reading about all Kort's troubled clients. I shouldn't have bought & don't recommend it. It's poorly written & edited. There are no clear interesting / useful ideas presented."
3,Mediocre Storyline,No significant depth of character and the story line is too unbelievable to make this a good book. A very quick read.
2,"If you Don't play, Don't read.","I don't play Halo. I got sucked into this series with Fall of Reach, which was a very entertaining book. I went on to book 2, The Flood, and it was horrid. But I gave book #3 a try because it was not the same author as #2. This book is nowhere near as bad as The Flood, but also nowhere near as good as Reach. Nylund got lazy and pumped out a book that reads like watching someone play the game...its shallow, boring, and the ending is unsatifying.I guess fans of the game like seeing their favorite characters/missions fleshed out, thus the high review ratings. Maybe a series like this appeals mostly to people that don't read a lot of science fiction. It sure seems to me that Nylund didn't bother putting any effort into this...perhaps he decided to write to his audience level. I don't know...but if you've never played Halo, do yourself a favor and skip this."
4,Strikes a Chord With Gamers,"Halo fans will like the series. This is a good installment in a series that doesn't necessarily have to be read in order. I especially liked the flashback part where the spartan kids were training. I sort of wish there was a whole book on John and his friends and their training on Reach.Book reads much like the games. Enemies swarm, good guys blaze away at them, some die, some don't, Master Chief triumphs again."
4,Happy news for Michael Casey fans,"If you liked Michael Casey's poems about the Viet Nam War in his award-winning ""Obscenities,"" as well you should, you'll also enjoy this second collection. Casey employs the same casual, idiosyncratic style to present anecdotes told in the voice of a partly disaffected and partly bemused military policeman, as if recounted over drinks at the local working class bar. These fine poems are utterly free of sentimentality, bombast, and pretension. Admirers of Charles Bukowski, Tom Waits, et al, will enjoy them. Fortunately, Adastra Press has produced a very fine, attractive, well designed letterpress edition. All good poets should have such handsome small letterpress collections."
3,An interesting text from medieval England,"In his Life of Cuthbert, Bede fills every page with a miracle due to the hands of the saint, whose powers of healing and prophecy are quite marvelous.Somewhat more credible is Eddius' Life of Wilfrid, also fraught with miracles, but more educational in the secular lives of the saint, his ministries, the relationships between church and state, plus descriptions of three pilgrimmages to Rome, so that Wilfrid might appeal to the Pontiff to restore his monasteries, usurped by the crown.An interesting look at the dealings at court in medieval England, the superstitions of the age, and a few hints at the powers of the Pope when England was monastic."
1,terrible product,This ring is of the same caliber as you would find in a vending dispenser that you pay 50cents for. Looks like it is make of solid plastic but is just a rubbery material. A child could not get this to light up.
5,The Catholic Youth Bible,"For young Catholics, this is one of the easiest to read Bibles published today. I distributed several to my students who had no interest in the Bible as well as to my grandchildren. The feedback has been: It's so easy to read and understand! Further, I would highly recommend this Bible for adults who have problems reading and/or understanding the more adult Bibles. It is my opinion no one can be misled in this review as to how valuable this Bible is to have in one's home."
5,My Favorite Show,"When I was growing up this was one of my favorite TV shows of all time. I always loved scary movies. This is very good for young adults. It is scary but not so much that it would terrify you, and not so gruesome you would have nightmares. I decided to purchase this for my 2 kids, because they also love horror movies. So I wanted a way they could enjoy without all the gore. They love it and can't get enough of it."
3,Loses Its Charm Fairly Quickly,"The problem with Blue Ruin is the narrator/protagonist, Sport Sullivan, the small-time Boston gambler who, in the novel's world, comes up with the idea of fixing the 1919 World Series. His garrulous recounting, filled (too filled) with period jargon, sets up everyone else in the fix, except Arnold Rothstein, as a loser and/or dunce. So why then, if he alone is so smart, does Sport throw away his winnings from the fix on every transparent scam that crosses his path? For a while I thought he was deliberately doing so to repent for the fix. But no, after the fix, he's just a dumb,though still smug and superior, dupe, which makes believing that he carried out all the elaborate twists of the fix just about impossible. Implausible in that way, overwritten, and too long, Blue Ruin is barely in three star territory for two reasons -- some of Boyd's writing does nicely capture the era and I at least am always a sucker for Black Sox stories."
4,Grijpstra & de Gier + Milan Jacovich = Carrol Dorsey?,"Thomas Lipinski has done for Pittsburgh what Les Roberts' Milan Jacovich series did for Cleveland: namely, put PI procedurals squarely in the middle of real, rust belt locales. ""Death in the Steel City"" adds a shot of Janwillem van de Wetering to the mix, as PI Dorsey ruminates on the ways of life and death, fathers and sons, and the polarities of race, creed, gender, and generations. Underneath it all is story good enough to keep fans of the genre turning pages and detail rich enough to keep expatriate Pittsburghers (like this reviewer) looking homeward. If you haven't discovered Lipinski and Dorsey, this is a good place to begin."
1,Battery Didn't Work,"Battery didn't work with the D300. Amazon however, where great when it came to returning the item for a refund."
1,Didn't last a full year,"Worked great in the fall of 2010, useless in the summer of 2011.The flap on top becomes loose and useless.The sprinkler will just stop turning even with the water valve wide open.Warranty is just 30 days."
5,Very insightful and a must have for any fan!,Its got every lyric I was eagerly searching for a long time.Plus a few interviews in english and german.but the true selling point is...The cover of the book glows in the dark!!!'nuff said.
1,Can you spell D-U-L-L?,"Chandler is the worst type of professor-writer, spewing forth words without saying anything. This book does not provide any new information, and his so-called analysis is nothing more than a desperate searching for meaning among what he would call ""texts."" He thinks he's contributing something new to the ""literary conversation,"" but all he's doing is putting his readers to sleep. And to make matters worse, he is an awful, clumsy writer."
4,Columbus Day,Val Kilmer is good in any movie he stars in. I especially liked his interaction with the little boy. Good movie. I recommend this to others.
1,Keeps you on the edge of your seat...but nothing happens,"This was an awful movie. I kept hoping something--anything--would happen, but apparently good script writers don't work on Columbus Day. I watched it for what felt like an eternity but still nothing had happened, so I went and did something else. My wife, on the other hand, is a die-hard Val fan and powered through it. She also was on the edge of her seat expecting something to happen. She wasn't particularly impressed, but at least it didn't end with him still sitting in the park."
5,A very rare film-and treat!,"I've been watching kung fu films for ages and have to say this one is a total rarity.Never heard of it.It must have been made at the height of the Jackie Chan craze in the early 1980's,since it stars `Jackie Chen'!The guy looks and moves like the real Jackie!He fights Bolo,and it also stars John Chang,who made Snake in the Monkey's Shadow.The film quality is great,but it's a full screen transfer.It is in 5.1 sound though.And the extra features are terrific-loads of cast and crew clips(including one on Jackie imitators!),and plenty of Wu Tang Clan material.These guys really live what they preach!I recommend this and the other Wu Tang Clan DVD's like-Shaolin Drunkard,Incredible Kung Fu Master,Snake Shadow Lama Fist,Kung Fu of 8 Drunkards, Revenge of the Patriots and 18 Fatal Strikes."
3,"Story is fine, but transfer is poor...","The fullscreen picture cuts off the left and right sides of original widescreen picture which becomes very noticable a number of times and interferes with the story. The sound sometimes gets quite a bit louder (usually the music) and then gets softer during the dialog. The last 10 seconds or so of the movie is just a black screen.But otherwise, the story and humor is pretty good and the kung-fu fair. At these prices and considering the (lack of) competition, I give it 3 stars. So far the other 5 Wu-tang kung-fu movies I have seen are also good (somewhat better than this)."
5,"A ""must have"" for Taylorphiles...","Terry's at it again. This venture reflects Terry's many years living in Orange County, CA.The title track speaks of the statue of John Wayne Airport in O.C. The bronze monument to Mr. Wayne ask's, ""...tell me pilgrim, how did I fail?"" The plastic lifestyle and affluence of this Southern California mecca as seen through the eyes of one of this century's most prolific lyricists.The depth of Terry's music is astounding. The more I hear this album, the more I like it. Of special interest to human beings is the track, ""Mr.Flutter"". That feeling you get in your gut when things are not quite as expected.If you have never heard of Terry, introduce yourself to Mr. Taylor with this CD."
2,Not for babies,"I received the turtle (there was no option to pick which animal I wanted but they all look cute). Because this was listed in the Baby department I thought it would be suitable for my 2-month-old, who is starting to accumulate grime under her teeny tiny delicate nails. However, the bristles are extremely stiff so I can't use it on her. Not sure I would even use it on myself.It could be used as a bath toy I guess, but not as a nail brush for babies or children.I'm returning it for this reason, but also because it was damaged - it was packed in cardboard but one-third of the bristles are bent at an almost 45 degree angle as if they've been under sheer pressure for a long time. Fortunately I am currently getting free returns with a trial Amazon Prime membership."
2,Might not fit control plate,The switch works like a switch should but it required filing down my fender control plate to reach the first and fourth position. Kind of a hassle!
2,semi-false advertising,"Well if you are buying this dvd to see Jackie Chan, don't. He is a side villian who has nothing to do with the plot and is barely in the movie. Typical of Groundzero and Black Belt theatre the real title of this film is probably not even ""Brutal Boxer"", it is rare i will give them that. The audio is especially horrible. Every time the scene changes from fight to dialogue there is a drastic volume change. Not to mention it is extremely boring and doesn't really feature any special martial art techniques. There is a reason this film is rare and that is because no one wanted you to see it!!! ""Shaolin One"" is the only thing that redeemed this double feature. Luckily I only paid $4 for this or I would have really felt like I got screwed over."
5,"RC that lasts, at last!","Boys love remote control gadgets, especially cars. However, the rc cars we have bought in the past proved far too fragile, usually losing at least the antenna on the first day. This one is definitely an exception! We bought two of these for our 9 and 11 year old boys for Christmas. They had them put together on their own by the time the batteries were charged, and have had a blast jumping them over speed bumps and ramps. The romote has three different chanels, so they can both race at the same time. They have even made a few modifications by changing pieces around and adding things from other lego sets. And talk about durable! Even our 6 year old, who is a master of disassembly, hasn't broken them!I agree that this toy is a bit pricey, but ours were the ""big present"" at Christmas and get lots of use. We love them!"
3,Average overall,"Videorecording quality is great. Camera is very user friendly. Biggest complaint is the placement of the zoom. They moved this from previous versions of this camera and it is in a difficult spot. Every time I try to zoom, the camera (and resulting picture) shakes while I try to find where to put my fingers - how frustrating!"
4,Sweet!!!!,"This game is very educational, but if you prefer arcade games M&Ms Blast has them. Check out this game, in stores now."
3,Good intro to HTML:,"You may start as the absolute beginner, learn HTML, and prepare your own web site by writing your own HTML code with the help of this book. You only need a plain text editing program, which comes with every PC operating system as the standard supply. You may do the same by utilising the HTML generating graphical softwares. This book will help you to prepare your web pages without investing for the web page creating software and/or you will learn HTML in order to have control over the HTML code generated by those softwares. Anything further than that is beyond this book and you need to look for other books with more technical coverage."
1,Crazy name but lame movie,"I thought i would take a gamble on this movie. I gambled wrong. I have no idea what the other guy saw to give it five stars. The quality of this movie was atrocious and the kung fu was really sub par. If your looking for a good movie to chill out and watch with some friends try: Master Killer, Fist of the white lotus, 18 fatal strikes or if you can find a copy of Mystery of chess boxing then your in for a real treat. >Peace"
3,Beautiful Picture Book,"Nothing new in the written content - just a basic description of her life. But features beautiful (and often big) black and white photographs of Jackie as a child, wife, First Lady, and beyond. Some photo's are of events and functions I had seen before, but taken from a different angle. Other's are more rare. Lovely book, but only for a true collector."
5,Buy at WalMart for $1.00,"These movies are so bad, they are fun to watch. Go ahead and spend the money! Had more fun then some of the overhyped Sci-Fi movies that cost me 80 times as much. (I look at it as if I spent a quarter a movie."
3,I can't really complain,"Hey for the price, this isn't bad. I bought the only one in stock at the time. I just wish I would have read more and even measured before ordering. The film on this roll is good, but it's not even enough to cover one full size window. That's my fault, because it gave the dimensions, and I didn't bother to measure. Also note, that it's not made for double pane windows. I assume that double pane windows sweat, and this is static cling film. The windows and doors at my apartment are double pane, and I didn't even realize it until I was putting it on.So again, there's nothing I can really fault the product for. I would just say, be sure you know the sizes and information on your windows before you order. Even though I only bought the one roll, I went ahead and placed it on my double pane window. Why not right? It's already helping keep some of the hot summer sunlight out of my west windows.- Tony"
4,WS-820V Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor,"This is handy to store or use anywhere---very compact and the case makes it easy. Great for travel. Had a bit of trouble using the '2-person' log system at first, but succeeded well thereafter. I have a very small wrist and tho it actually fits, I have to be careful not to move or it will slip a little. Make sure you hold it in the proper position when monitoring: ie; distance and position from heart. Very pleased overall."
3,"Lots of slots, could have better navigation","Lots of slots, but the navigation could be a bit better. The pop-up menus are the way they navigate between machines. You would think that they would take this into a bit more graphic world. Also, the games are okay, but I would have liked to see more ""graphics"" on the slots. It's okay for a software game of slots, but I think in 2013, it get's an ""ok"" rating, as it seems a bit primative."
5,Safe Harbor,I enjoyed this movie. Great insite on lives of troubled chlidren and what a difference a caring heart can make.
4,Good value for your dollar,"I bought this banner flag as a birthday gift for my husband, the ultimate Browns fan. He's wanted one for years, but until I saw this one I hadn't found one that wasn't super expensive or looked cheap. This has nice embroidery and the colors are rich and true. It's also double sided, so you can hang it from a flag pole inside or out. He loved it and I think the price is really good for the quality."
4,great portable sound,this nokia music stand is a great way to supply back ground music with out having to wait for adds. Just hook up a mp3 unit and listen to your tunes.
5,I found it!,"I am so excited! I finally found ""Henry and The Great Society"" on Amazon.com. I've been looking for it forever! I borrowed the book the first time and I've been searching for my own copy! I've looked in libraries, old book stores and everywhere! But, only Amazon had it! This book is excellent!"
2,you get what you pay for,I cheaped out and ordered this based on price. Good for general work and they are a bargin. I am saving up for a better set
3,Decent for the price,This is a decent bib. It does it's job as long as your child isn't distracted by all the bright colors.
5,This is the only brand of bib you'll need!,"I love, love, love these bibs! So easy to clean (I rinse them off in the sink after each meal and then when I have a load of laundry I just toss them in)I had some plastic-like cheap bibs I received as a shower gift. The printed design was rubbing off and they were beginning to smell bad, even when clean. I decided to toss them and splurge on new Bumkins bibs. Best decision I've made in awhile! Yes, they are a little more expensive than other bibs out there. But so worth it, in the time I now save washing up after mealtimes.These bibs have now become my standard baby gift along with the TinyDiner portable placemat (another of my fav baby products!)"
2,Don't know why people rave about Bumkins bibs,"I really do not understand the good reviews of these bibs.We have had two main problems with them: 1) they have velcro fasteners: as soon as my daughter figured this out (at less than 10 months old) the bibs were unusable. They were off the moment I turned around. 2) any liquid runs either below or above the bib (some gets collected in the pocket, by just some). So, most liquids end up on my daughter's clothes or on the floor.Better Bumkins bibs are the long-sleeved ones, which have string ties, but their pockets are useless (they are sewn in the middle, making two small pockets, but almost nothing gets trapped in them..). We ended up using the long-sleeved bib for first art projects.I gave 2 stars because they indeed are a breeze to clean up."
5,Awesome bibs!,Finally a perfect bib! These are by far the best I've tried. They wash well by hand or machine. They dry between meals. They do not stain. The pocket is designed to stay out well to catch crumbs. They are adjustable- my three year old and 10 month old share them. The material is light and flexible. Best of all- no PVCs or vinyl like so many others. All this and the patterns are even cool. I suggest them to eveyone I know who has little kids.
4,Love these!,I love the prints on the Keith Haring bibs. These fit my son really well and are easy to rinse in the sink or just run through the laundry and air dry. The little pocket thing didn't really catch food well until I washed it a couple times and it became more rigid. Either way I like these better than those big rubber bibs which are so awkward and they don't restrict my son from moving while he's trying to eat! I recommend these.
5,best tbs game around,"i bought 4 copies of age of wonders to give out as christmaspresents to the friends who enjoy table-top wargames and thatliked to get together every so often to play.about a year later i bought 2 copies of age of wonders 2 for meand my brother inlaw to play,we've even got my wifes dadinvolved in playing..great game,just as good as Heros of Might & Magic."
3,"Enjoyable, but flawed","Building on the original Age of Wonders, it's an enjoyable fantasy strategy game.Unfortunately, it suffers from graphical glitches with some graphics cards, mine included (GeForce 4 Ti4400, 30.82 drivers); the only remedy is to turn off DirectX acceleration, which costs a moderate amount of performance and eye candy.Given that this glitch is still present after the 1.20 patch ... not so impressive."
5,The Funniest,"The wittiest cartoons ever, with a voice cast second to none. Gary Owens as Roger is tops, and his new DVD commentaries are charming, enlightening, and hysterical (What else would you expect?). Fun and funny -- not only timeless, but resonant with the world in 2002."
3,Nice video but could be updated,I got this to watch on a non-blu ray player. While it shows the beauty of GNP it has was looks like older footage and so lacks that colorful vibrancy of newer DVDs. I just visited GNP this past September so I admit I was a bit disappointed in the overall quality- esp. since I purchased it based off Reader's Digest's good name. So I'm purchasing a more current blu ray DVD so that I can view this national park in all its true glory.
5,Danny my little friend 6 years old love this book !!! : ),Excellent book !!! for kids to learn geography and have fun ! Beautiful !!! Danny love this book ! Thanks !!! : )
3,Cheaper but watch out for toxic compounds in this formulation,"While shopping for Sam-E, I was concerned that this brand did not post its ingredients list. Well, guess why not! On their own web page, they reveal that talc and Yellow #5 is used, among other nasties. Of course, if this sort of thing doesn't bother you, you might as well save a lot of money over similar brands like ""NatureMade""."
2,Not Bad,"Camelot isn't a bad album, but I expected more from Deliverance. Unlike Stay of Execution there isn't even 1 song you can't not have. Overall not nearly as strong as Learn, which is probably the closest style wise. Not great but if you're a big Deliverance fan it's worth getting if the price is right."
2,Instant Shed & Shop Design - Rip Off,This program was not worth the money I spent on it. It is very limited in what you can do with the program.
1,Lame at best; extremely incomplete,This video is a glossy overview of the Gulf War. A lot of focus on the personal lives of a few individuals. No mention of in-depth topics or events. And no mention of Gulf War Illness.
3,Overrated,"I personally didn't care for GTA3. Pre-release hype had led me to believe that it was a create-your-own-solution type game in the same vein as Deus Ex. Boy is that off the mark. I can only think of a handful of missions that really had multiple approaches, the rest fell into the fedex and get to point B as fast as possible category. I really wanted to like the game but the missions just didn't offer a whole lot. Granted there is the whole free form side of the game but at least for me, driving around and shooting stuff got old real fast. While the game definatly tried things that most games don't go into GTA3 is not particularly revolutionary or ahead of its time. Me, I'm back to Mafia."
2,Not New,"This product was described as in factory packaging, whoever the tape on the box was oppen, but other then that it was in good condition"
5,The reason i am even alive anymore,"This is hands down one of the top 5 games ever. Full 3d gameplay with both on foot and in the car capabilities. 73 missions to pass, as well as some 20 unique jumps, rampages, and others to complete. 100 hidden pacakages, taxi missions, vigilante missions fire missions, more. This game has hours of gameplay, with nothing quite the same. Top it all off with SWEET graphics, much better than the originals. get this game, your fingers will hate you, but nothing else will."
3,Seeing ghost images,"I really love GTA for PS and PC, but this PC verison creates moving ghost images when you are in a dark alley. Tried reloading it 2 other times but still no help. Just stay out of the dark and I will not see these images. Images consist of like stuff on the walls (vents, ladders, fans) and when you look around the images follow...weird. Quality is not the best compaired to what screen shots i have seen b4 purchasing, and freezes up from time to time w/o any other programs running in the background. My system requirements exceed there standards, P4 w/ duel video cards, 8gigs of ram..etc."
4,Driven Away!,"Great graphics, storyline, audio and features. I couldn't give it five stars due to the initial problems I had loading it...freeze and crash. However, I was running an ATI Radeon 8500 with only 64 MB of memory. It runs VERY WELL on the GeForce4 Ti 4600 with 128 MBs. So if you have the right equipment, I recommend this game."
1,Game does not function,"The man walks to the left constantly and it cannot be STOPPED.It takes just about a magician to drive the vehicle, it won't turn wheels to the right with the letter ""D""The CD is worn out or incompatible with Windows XP. I hate to give anyone a bad review but this game is terrible because the games CD seems to be either physically flattened or scratched, I did not take magnifying glass nor even look for scatches.I tried my standard cleaning my turning it in a circle in a very soft cloth on playing side in attempt to fix the problem but it remains so I am not happy with the game at all, it is NOT PLAYABLE.It is so worn out or incompatible, to me(?), it does not matter what the reason is, I bought a GAME THAT DOES NOT PLAY, I must rate that zero happiness, you would do same no? I mean I am not trying to hurt someoone here, I just want a game that works.JoeKidd"
5,Best but Demanding PC Game!,"Grand Theft Auto Fan rejoice! GTA is back with a vengeance on PC. Awesome graphics, large cities, hilarious radio. Be Warned: This game requires a heck of a PC to play (I have a 32mb GeForce 2 MX and it struggles some!) I recommend a P4 with a 32MB video card or better. You should keep this game away from children, it has intense violence, language, and sexual subjects. Overall it is a great game and can acheive better graphics then on the Playstation 2 version. You can cruise the cities listening to any style of music (Hip Hop, Rap, 80's, Talk Radio, Reggae, etc.), I recommend the Talk Radio station, it is so stupid its funny. I recommend this game to all users as long as you think you can handle it."
2,spend your money elseware,"When i bought this game, I expected it to live up to its predicesors (GTA and GTA2); however, it simply doesn't. Right off the bat, this game will only run on maybe 2/3 of the systems out there, if you have an onboard sound or video chip, duron, or celeron procesor you can forget it. Even then, many video cards experience wierd anomolys and signifigant slowdowns when you get into a firefight. The gameplay itself is utterly repetitive, with most missions just being a harder rehash of previous one. Weapons now need to be purchased, and the better one are very very expensive, limiting them to sporatic use. Overall, by the time you've reached the third (and final) island, you'll be board stiff, as you will have spent 15-20 hours doing the exact same thing, only to find that the game holds only more of the exact same thing for you. This game is fun, for about 5 hours, then it [is] just [bad]."
4,"Solid, scary","I was impressed. I thought it was going to be more Tales From the Hood because the trend for African Americans is the ghetto fiction. I saw the erotic writer Zane's name on the cover and it worried me, until I looked at her story. It wasn't great but wasn't bad. Tananarive Due, LABanks, S. Barnes and Christopher Chambers never disappointed me before, and they don't here! The stories are solid as anything I've seen in mainstream horror from Clive Barker and S. King."
2,Not what I thought...,I got this book because I was so impressed by the 2nd volume. I was NOT IMPRESSED with this one... AT ALL!! I really tried to like it because I want to support our Black authors but this collection was just... well... bad. There were only a few stories that caught and kept my attention and a few I even skipped!Didn't do that with the 2nd volume! I don't know if this one was an experiment or what but it wasn't good at all. Not even close. I will get Volume 3 and I can only hope that it's in the same spirit as #2. Save your money on this one.
3,Dark Dreams: A Collection of Horror and Suspense by Black Writers,"I always try to support Black writers. I'm from the generation where there were few and far between on mainstream stories and zilch (until a few years ago), on sci-fi, horror and suspense. In this particular book, though, some of the stories are good, while others leave you wondering why the author even bothered. I'm not a writer and could have come up with better story lines than some I've read here. But I'm not going to let that stop me from buying and supporting my African-American writers."
2,Did not work as well as other products out there,"After using Nutricoat for over 2 months it has not worked as well as other products. My dog is starting to itch again and his coat is flaky. I tried this product because it was cheaper than Arctic Paws Salmon oil Supplement that i use to buy. I will not buy this product again. When using arctic paws you can smell the fishy salmon and it almost leaves a greasy lining on the bowl. This product is light in color and has no smell. It does not help with his coat or entice him to eat his food as much. But each dog is different, my boarder collie give it a paws down."
2,"great concept, horrible execution","The concept of the game is great. You get to control all kinds of aspects of the country, like how big the military is, to alliances, to economic treaties, to taxes and city growth. But the game has several infuriating glitches. After a while, and it always happens if you haven't saved for a while (toast lands butter side down type of thing), the game just crashes. Several times i have armies of over 5 million that just disappear. Sometimes you conquer a nation but you aren't controlling it for some reason. Stuff like that. I could also never get the user-controlled battles to work correctly. I could get the units deployed, but they would never attack."
2,Kindle version,I wish that I had known that the 2012 Kindle version is not the same as the 2002 paperback edition. Major changes were made in some of the chapters. The 2012 version appears to try & relate the story to the King James version of the Christian Bible. The 2002 was closer to the Gnostic texts & for me more believable.
3,Question,"What I dont' understand about this item is how to connect more than one hose to it. This other customer's review says ""and it allow you to hook 6 hoses with each having its own watering schedule""how do you do that, this looks like a hose-end timer?"
1,Not what I was expecting,If a book doesn't grab me in the first few pages I know I'll most likely not finish it. This was one of those. I am an avid reader and this book just plods along with random attack scenes and confusing inner dialog and relationships. I bought it based on other reviews but I dont understand how anyone can rate this higher than a 1. I stopped reading it after 4 chapters because it just never got any better. I hate an unfinished story and this is 1 of 5(out of around 200) I had to delete from my kindle due to lack of interest.
1,cracked after one season,The connector cracked after only one season of use. It is going to be expensive to replace them every year
2,Too strong for a woman,The scent of this perfume it's too strong. I would recommend you to buy Elizabeth Taylor White Diamond instead of Diamond and Sapphires. I really don't know if what I got was a real Elizabeth Taylor product- because of the way it's smells-.
4,"not my favorite, but I still like it","this a little strong, but I still like it. I last. Just don't use much.It has a fantastic price. After the fragrance has been on a while it calms down.I would buy it again So I guess I guess I like it enough to continue to have it as one of my fragrances to choose from."
4,Good reading,I have always enjoyed this book. Mr. Parker Pynne is such a wonderful character. He is so very much interested in statistics. He uses that knowledge to make people feel happy. I just love the way he does this.
5,Whoa!,"She looks really,really good naked. If you want to see a ""phat"",beautiful body and you like women,yo you better get it. Besides,it's not every day you get to see a singer nude."
2,A Very Slow Read,"I had read the first book in this series and found it likeable. This one however, was very slow to read. I got tired of the unnamed detective coming on to every women he met. Some of the food descriptions were quite interesting.The visit to Dr. Li seemed almost paranormal. By the time I got to the end of this book I couldn't remember reading about the murderer until near the end of the book. I decided to go back & read the book again to see if this was the case. However, it was so slow to read, I decided it wasn't worth it. I just didn't care. I wouldn't read another book in this series."
3,Fascinating Tour of Cuisines...Too Much Libido,"I very much enjoyed this (2nd in the series) for the whirlwind tour of cuisines, the information about the historical and current value of spices, and the ""you-are-there"" description of the locale. However, the lead character views every woman he meets in terms of her figure. His constant lustfulness brings the story down, which is why it only rates 3 stars."
5,In control,"This sprinkler from Gardena gives you all the control you want watering the garden. Little more on he right and a little less on the left, it's all possible. Don't waste water to your neigbors yard, just use this sprinkler (the neighbors won't be gratefull)."
4,This stuff works great.,I bought this to put on all my bolts on my saiga 5.45x39 project every thing holds strong.I recommend this product for any one doing small projects and don't want screws coming apart.
5,great rice,"We love this rice. We can no longer find a good blend in the local stores, being able to order it online is a great alternative."
5,soooo good,"I really love the earthiness of wild rice blends and this one tastes really great. If you don't want your rice to be too grainy, just add some extra white or brown rice. I like it just as it is. I also gave it to one of my friends to try and she loved it as well. Highly recommended. Grocery shopping through amazon? I think YES!"
3,good for the new year,this book really helped me so far this year. the things that it says often come true. some parts are hard to understamd though.
4,Excelente eleccion,"el Tv es excelente como TV, esteticamente es mucho mas decorativo que cualquier otro TV LCD, por sus acabados acrilicos, al parecer viene con un decodificador de canales (encriptados) ya que Intercable en Venezuela, tiene unos canales digitales encriptados que solo se ven con decodificador y con este TV se ven todos los canales, incluyendo unos de musica como los de Direct TV, (jazz, rock, pachanga, etc, etc) la imagen es genial, estoy esperando el CD para calibrar los colores para peliculas HD, en fin, fué una excelente eleccion."
4,Great deal,I believe in Samsung. All 3 of my LCD HDTVs are Samsung. I have now bought 2 from Amazon..great value...great deals.
2,Mirada De Mujer,"I watched this soap opera when it was on television. Loved it, but the DVD that I bought has so many hours missing. It was so disappointing to see that. I do not understand how come they did not included all those hours. That soap opera ran 1 year. I would have been willing to pay more, but I was not given that option."
5,A great video for the whole family!,"This beautiful video of wildlife set to classical music has been a favorite of our three year old since he was a baby. It is very soothing, especially before bed, and he loves naming the different animals he sees. I have even heard him humming the classical tunes."
1,Poor quality materials sabotage great design,"I just received mine a couple of days ago. The design is great, but the cheap materials used in manufacture, make it unusable. At least unusable for me.The screw threads are not secure and after I put some salt into one side, I noticed some red thread-like material in the salt, after I screwed in the cap bottom. Red threads of plastic from the cap bottom, from screwing it in.When I screw the cap bottoms on to each end (and the clear bodies into the center piece), there is a slight catch point - but then the cap/body still turn. It's like you never get to the final stopping point of screwing on the cap, it just keeps going and going and going.The design is great, but the product, due to poor quality materials and construction, is unusable."
4,Great pedal!!,This is an amazing pedal for the price!!! I've had mine for almost a year and it's by far one the best I've ever played on!!
1,New design is not good,"Booda changed the design of these and now they have a PVC pipe fitting in the center. The older design lasted for four months with my great dane, this one made it for three days and came apart. JUNK !!"
2,Not put together well,"I received the item and it looked like what I expected, nice bulk to the rope. I needed a replacement for a similar rope tug. I have a pit bull but the last rope lasted a long time. This one did not last. After an hour of play the middle plastic piece was cracked and chewed up and the rope came out of the middle. Was only being held in the middle connector by a strip of glue. Will not purchase again."
1,Disappointing,"I was disappointed. It seemed as if Gaillardetz wasn't sure whether he wanted to write an autobiographical reflection on his own experience of marriage or whether he wanted to write a theological book. Because of this confusion, the book succeeds as neither. There are interesting passages, but none fail to capture the imagination or the heart.Especially troubling for the Catholic reader who accepts Church teaching will be Gaillardetz's disparaging remarks about Catholic teaching on artificial birth control."
5,Addicted to Tropico Paradise Island,"Tropico Paradis Island is continual FUN! Endless pick of islands, presidents, and geography...This game is always a challange and if all else fails you can just go to another island for a break! I love it!"
2,Disappointed in Lack of Mac Release,"The original Tropico was released to Mac gamers, but this expansion pack still hasn't been. I'm disappointed, as the original was a very entertaining simulation game. I'm not holding out much hope for a Mac relase of Tropico 2 when it comes out this winter, either. Us stubborn Mac users deserve to be benevolent dictators of our own banana republics, too, you know!"
2,Swimwear Rescue Boat stay away!,"Wow, what a dissapointment! ""The top of the Line baby float"" In what world??First after opening the box and seeing parts floating around I knew this was going to be a mess.Cons:1. Stickers must be applied yourself, and they are cheap and peel right up.2. Missing a part that attaches the canopy to the boat.3. Working horn was laying in the box and would not go on properly. So the new boat has a non working horn that I glued in place.4. The canopy mesh was not sewn properly and is peeling away from the seam. After 20 minutes of sewing it is somewhat repaired, but wont last.Pro's:1. Sturdy plastic that wont puncture.2. Seat seems comfortable for baby.I will be calling Swimwear in the morning for the replacement part and a new canopy that I dont have to sew. In my opinion I will try it out in the pool, but more than likley return it to Walmart."
3,Wherevis the horn?,"Haven't put it in the water yet, so I can't review that yet. But, where is this horn that is advertised? I can't get the pole for the shade in either...."
2,A woman's greed,"The title has been contrived to lure those who love the sight of high heeled women, but the role of the actress in stilleto slides is more focused on her next boyfriend's money. Stacey Kane, played by Meg Miles, shows the result of a person who has grown up in a world of greed and drugs. She has learned to get ahead, by looking out for herself through any means as she wields control by using her womanly assets and deceit. She could have made a better life, but she is only concerned about what she wants in controlling others, even if it causes some to die."
4,Ravensburger Scotland Yard - Family Game,Purchased as a Christmas gift from someones Amazon Gift List. The person knows games so I guess that is a recommendation.
3,Accounting books are rough to begin with.,"I got very little out of the book - it didn't seem to focus on real-life situations. It was quite clear, but just didn't seem relevant. However, the examples/problems combined with the solution manual were quite helpful in mastering the given topics. Books by Krachey and Schindelar were a bit better."
4,case is fine but the smell....,"got this the other day, and the case itself is great. snug fit on my pistol and 2 clips.problem was the outside had a horrible smell on it as soon as i took it out of the plastic. it smelled just like a sweaty hat would after a weeks worth of working outside (my dad does construction, his hats smell like this around mid summer). i tried washing it and febreezing it to death but it still smells a little. i dont know if it had gotten wet in storage or what but it was so unpleasant i almost sent it right back. would have gotten 5 stars if not for this."
4,Not What I thought,Actual dimensions of this rug was not in the description posted on Amazon. I gave this a 4 star rating because of poor description. I took a chance and ordered. My Mark III with pistol scope will not fit. All in all it's a great gun rug for the price - I'll keep it for other handguns I own and try to find something bigger. Very fast shipping by Amazon.
4,"Nicely made, needed even larger","This would have been fine for my purposes, except it isn't big enough to hold my 5.5"" barrel target pistol with a red-dot sight attached. My bad for not checking dimensions more carefully."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS HER PREVIOUS WORKS,"I did not find this book as enjoyable as her previous works. Her others I was not able to put down. This book got tired and hard to get into, once you did there was so much scenery writing that it got boring after a while. The book skipped around a lot. I was very disappointed. I have all her books and this was by far a no brainer. Was not even a good story."
2,"Don't waste your money, get it from the library!","The love scenes were great, and the plot was doing fairly well until the end. Then things got silly and downright predictable. Not Ms. Ryan's best effort."
4,Just be seduced by Ms. Ryan's prose,"Nan Ryan's historical romances set against the lush western frontier is definite to please- and with a story of Ellen Corneius as a spinster bound to her spoiled aunt Alexandra embarking on a quest to immortality, Ellen finds a taunting challenge especially Steve Corey whom she believes is a charlatan. They embark on an expedition to the Lost City in search of magic water to prolong Alexandra's youth.Rest assured, sensuality and full-blown passion is her triumph in this novel but with an exquisite tenderness and compunction for the characters as well - it is though difficult to accept the drastic change of demeanour towards the end when her aunt gains redemption, and the lovers treating each other with mutual respect. Ellen as a prim spinster and she matches well and feisty as the leading lady; Steve is equally enigmatic and dark as a hero. As a romance, logic is cast aside - just be seduced by Ms. Ryan's passionate writing."
4,TWO FOR ONE,"This is an nice addition to your hose at work station! If you need to water two different areas at once and only have one hose bib, this is your solution. Although very inexpensive this is a great piece of equipment, well made and easy to use. The bright color makes it easy to spot, when you are looking for it."
3,"Not as good as the others, but ok.","This game is good for fans of the tycoon games. I would not recommend this game to a person who has never played the tycoon games. If you are new to this genre of games, play Rollercoaster tycoon or Zoo tycoon first. This game is very confusing and there are some very annoying and confusing parts to it that I still don't get. The directions are very fuzzy and not at all specific. I still enjoy playing the game though, because it IS fun to make your own mall. If you have played a couple of tycoon games before, you should enjoy this one."
2,Not worth buying,"I was excited to see this game for the first time in stores.I had to buy a video card for this game to work on my computer and once it worked it got boring. The first time I played thought it was great, but know I think it's boring and not worth your the time. A child would enjoy it better with the simple graphics and easy tools to build the mall."
1,it [stinks],"the graphics [stink]. the sound [stinks]. the whole game [stinks]. the concept was great, but the game [stunk]."
2,"Lacks basic needs, and really confusing","When I first go this game I didn't expect much. If you buy this game you shouldn't. I was having fun the first hour and a half aof play, then it just gets stupid. If you don't keep your mall clean, aliens come and take everyone out of your mall. And you need to maximize everything you can use to benifit your mall because you lose all of the money for upgrades and to pay employees. It is very cofusing and you don't get to set the prices of your limited stores. The graphics are horrible (the peoples faces are blocks) and you can only have two floors to your ""mall"". Most of the time, your mall is outside or has carpet floors. DON'T GET FOOLED BY THE COOL COVER LIKE ME! DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!"
3,Alot of People dont like it because you have to wait....,"This game i enjoy, but dont think it is the best in the world. You pretty much play with someone elses mall or build your own. ( i suggest building your own!) And you pick the carpet walls size of your store and what you put in side of it. You can add scenery and research diffrent things like events for your mall and stuff. You also can download Janitors and cops to catch punks. Then you pretty much open your mall and people buy things in it and you try to become rich. When you play in someone elses mall you have a job to do, And you try to beat it. I whould not recomend this game for 10- and daown.( it can be very confusing) But older people might get really bored of it."
1,this game STINKS!!,"I got this game under false advertising because if you see the cover, it looks like it has good graphics... Well, it dosen't! I also thought it was associated with roller coaster tycoon, but it isn't.The graphics are terrable, its too complicated, and its boring. I wish I could've given it no stars. It's a waste of money so don't buy it!"
2,This Mall Wasn't A Ball,"All the other Tycoon games I have tried out I loved, they all would be so much fun to play. So I bought this game thinking it would be the same, boy was a I wrong! This game stunk! The people aren't even drawings literally scribbles, and the mall that you build is a total bust! The features are poorly done and everything is so pathetic! If this was the first Tycoon game I bought I would never get another one! Luckily some of the other Tycoon games are better! :)"
1,Get this game if you like wasting your money!,"PC GAME REVIEW:Basically, the game involves building and running a shopping mall.I got the game, because the pictures of the game on the box gave the impression that it would be a fun game to play. Also, I spend a lot of time at the mall, so I thought this game would be really fun, because it had two of the things I really like--the mall, and video games.Unlike most simulation (SIM) games, which is fun to play for hours then gets boring after a while, this game is boring from the start! The animations are awful, and it slows down my computer quite frequently!I wouldn't suggest this game to anybody. If you're looking for a great SIM game, I suggest getting ""The Sims"" and its expansion packs."
2,Ugh!,"I was really excited when I got this game. Talk about total disappointment! The money is totally unproportional and the game just overall stinks! Please, don't waste your money!"
2,One of the worst Tycoon games by far,"I am a huge fan of tycoon games and this one is awful! What few controls you have are not 'instinctive' and it's basically just.. boring. You buy a shop, which is pre-made and plop it down on the plot. That's about all there is too it. Plus you can hire a few people (janitors and security I believe) and that's about it. It's boring, the graphics are horrible and its a waste of money. Believe me, I have played just about every single tycoon game out there, you will have a lot more fun with Zoo Tycoon, Rollercoaster Tycoon, SimCity, the Sims.. even Restaurant Empire."
5,If you loved Roller coaster Tycoon this is a must.,"If your a roller coaster tycoon fan buy this game. It is the same thing as roller coaster tycoon but you build a mall. You can get security, janitor, and merry go rounds in your mall. Also you can get a roller coaster in your mall because every tycoon must have a roller coaster.This game is the best."
4,Unexpectedly Small,"I got this cute adorable kitten in the mail and thought it would be bigger. I guess I didn't approximate 7"" well, but extremely cute, just a bit pricey for the cat."
3,[my opinion],I personaly LOVE the roswell books by melinda metz and the show.Roswell is one of my fave shows ever. I started to read the books around the same time the show started and i liked the fact that the books are difrant from the shows. That way you don't know every thing that will happen. before it happens. And if you read the books and pay attention to the shows there are tons of stuff that are linked together just not the way you exspect it to be. Like Isabels boy friend nickolas hes also int the show. But he dated the Isabel that lived on the plant and he didnt die. Plus in the books theres a lot more people that die. And ensted of a brother micheal finds out he has a sister ensted of a brother. Plus she dosent act the brother from the books. Its ok thoe because that makes it more fun...
5,Nice Combs,"I use the Cricket Silkomb Pro-25 every day. I came across the Cricket brand years ago and have stuck with it. My hair is long and those cheap plastic combs that you'd buy at the grocery store just don't work for me, they generate static electricity and cause alot of breakage. The Cricket comb is much better quality, it's anti-static and flexible but durable so I can detangle my hair easily, and it lasts for years. It's also easy to keep clean."
4,Works Great. Does exactly what it says...but,"This item works exactly as advertised. However, if you are like me, you may have used similar devices in the past to switch an outgoing source signal to various receiving devices. This is the opposite function of the one for which this switch is designed (i.e. switching several incoming signals from various devices to a single receiving device - usually a TV).This device does not work bi-directionally (you can't input a signal through the output and then output that signal through the inputs), so you can't send the same signal to various devices, switching between them. I've done this successfully in the past with other switches, but with this one - no love.This is NOT a criticism. Just a warning that if you intend to use this switch in this fashion, it will not work (at least, it doesn't for me).A"
1,ARRIVED DEAD ON ARRIVAL,"Arrived dead on arrival...would not respond to either remote control or manual selections. Also, when 1 was pressed on the remote, 4 would light up on the unit ( 2 and 3 buttons lit up just fine, except they would not switch over). I am tempted to call this a piece of junk, but since it is the holiday season, I will refrain from doing so."
1,Poorly Designed,"I used this video switch for a day before it just didn't respond to the remote control anymore. I had to unplug the unit, then plug it back in, to make it work again...for another day.I returned the unit for replacement and had the same problem with the new one.Obviously there is a design problem, so I would not recommend this switch."
3,Untidy and as beautiful as nature!,"Okri can inspire his readers by totally tranforming their expectations in a very short space of time. In ""Astonishing The Gods"" however, he can at times fail to live up to his own expectations for the book. Without, discussing the ending, his warmth for humanity seems to undermine many human qualities which are found in the migrant, travelling theme.Time might improve this novel, as many sections are a little esoteric if not spontenious. Perhaps, that is the charm of the book, as well as its weakness."
5,Intense Core Trainer,The Ab Wheel will strengthen your abdominals from top to bottom as well as your lower back. It is a very intense exercise - you will not have to spend a lot of time doing the exercise in order to get excellent results. For most individuals (myself included) I recommend starting slowly. Do not try to do a full extension of the exercise. Initially the full extensions put some undue stress on the lower back. With each work out you can extend a little furthur and in no time you will likely build up to full extensions.
5,Just what the chiropractor ordered,"This device is exactly what I was looking for. Once you get comfortable enough on your knees, try starting from the standing position; very challanging.I have to disagree with the ""not worth it"" review. The whole POINT of this device is to force your body to WORK so a mechanism to make your workout easier would be counterproductive. Stop whinging and do the work."
2,Disappointing!,"After seeing the previews for this movie, I thought the book would be good. It was just okay. I was disappointed in it. It didn't absolutly suck, but it wasn't as good as I had expected it to be!"
2,boring!,"I read more than half of this book, and then had to call it quits! I was just skimming over the quilting instructions - unless you are a quilter, who cares? I guess we were supposed to get some 'life' lessons from them, but I didn't think the analogy worked. The only characters that I really liked were Hy and Glady Jo; I really wanted to hear more about them, riding around in their Chevy station wagon, 'visiting their children and grandchildren flung like stars across the United States'."
1,"Never, EVER read this book","This book was absolutely horrible. The first book in this series was really good, but the books, not to mention the McDougal sisters, progressively get dumber as you go along. Amelia has to be the most stupid, ignorant heroine I have ever had the displeasure of reading about. I mean, how does Ms. Copeland expect us to believe that she's a con-artist when the girl has the IQ of, oh, say, an earth worm! And Amelia's unhealthy obsession with bacon, while amusing, is really gross. In conclusion, all I have to say is: in the name of all that is holy, what were you thinking Lori?"
3,Not like I thought it would be,"I got this doll for my graduation project on 80's cultutre and she is definitly NOT what I grew up with. Although cute, she is just not like I remembered. Her body is plastic***not stuffed like the old dolls*** and her hair is a lighter yellow color***In the 80's, her hair was an orange-ish color*** She isn't as adorable as the beloved girl I grew up with.Still, my little cousin loves her to death, just like Strawberry Shortcake and the Care Bears. The latest 80's retro toy trend has come to Rainbowland.It isn't like the past, but it's darn close enough***GOODY NOTE*** The dolls comes with a 20 minute DVD of an episode of the old Rainbow Brite. it just goes to show some good things never change"
5,Nothing compares to Julie Andrews!,"I love the movie of My Fair Lady - and you can't hear this music without seeing the beautiful Audrey Hepburn as Eliza (though she borrowed the great singing voice of Marni Nixon for that film). But this recording is by the original Broadway cast of the show, featuring Julie Andrews who had one of the finest singing voices in the world at the time.The contrast between her sweet and passionate soprano and Rex Harrison's crusty 'speech-song' just helps to illustrate the social and economic gulf between their characters.And of course, every song in the show is an absolute classic!"
4,12 yr old gamer,"lol this game ROCKS 1st of all my name is cameron and i thought it was a real kick when i saw wht it was called, its prob the 2nt BEST and MOST FUN game i have (1st is age of empires 2 COOLEST GAME EVER MADE)although dont be foold by the cover, its not as scary as it looks ( definatly not as scary as MYST)its more of a mystry then it is a scary game BUT they do cuss a lil bit in it i wouldnt buy this for a 6 yr probably a 8 or 9 yr old mostly cuz of a lil cussin and its hard i had to get codes for it. but over all its a SWEAT game, i think its worth every penny of the 20 bucks, to CD's and all its a prety long game, and hard i love it but once you beat the whole thing im probably not gonna play it anymore. anyways i love the it is a MUST have for people who love MYST if you know what that game is lol. :)"
5,The best sprinkler ever made,"This is the best sprinkler made. I'm going to buy one of these for each of our family members for Christmas. They will enjoying using this product and it's dependable,too. It is the best. Thank You, VP"
4,Fosse doing what he does best!,"All That Jazz is good, Tells the story of Fosse ..but this is what Fosse is about .. It shows his talent in choreography and the people that experienced it!Wonderful! IF you enjoy dance.. get FOSSE"
3,They had it coming when they planned this one,"I was sorely disappointed after seeing this version of Fosse. I saw the theater version of the show and enjoyed it far more than this video. Ben Vereen and Ann Reinking are indeed legends of the stage, however their presence in this production did little to improve the quality of the show. In fact, I simply did not like their performances.There are some highlights that are on this video, including ""I Gotcha"" and ""Sing Sing Sing."" However, I highly recommend that if you really want to feel the amazing energy from a Fosse performance that you see this show live."
3,Missing some of the magic,"I saw this show on Broadway a month after it opened, and Ben Verene was not in the show. This is not the cast that won the Tony. I saw it on PBS last spring and the show seemed to be reworekd to add Verene. On Broadway the show was magic and full of energy and life. Here, the magic has worn off a bit, but it's still worth seeing. I'd reccomend the Original Cast Recoding as well."
2,The editor should be banned,"Some person named Girish Bhargava edited what could have been a wonderful experience. Apparently, Bhargava is an ex-MTV reject who thinks Fosse's choreography does not have the power to stand alone without frenetic cutting back and forth, up and down, never allowing your eye to settle on the scene itself. Horrible, horrible, horrible. And one more thing: How about letting us see the feet of the dancers once in a while? Now there's a concept. Most of the intricate steps are lost because the editor does not trust the material. Rent it for the few great moments; don't buy it--it will continuously disappoint."
2,meh,"This is a game which survives on its predecessor. The combat system is revamped, and I give credit where it's due - they had a lot of good ideas. It needs a bit of fine-tuning, but if it gets the tuning and appears in another game I think it has a good deal of potential.The problem comes in the story. It isn't really engaging, and plot points are few and far between. It is difficult to keep working through the combat to get to the story, as turn-based games are pretty much designed around, when you know you are like an hour away from the next cut-scene.Overall, it isn't a bad game, it just fails to shine. It lacks polish, and it has major pacing issues. If you can make it past those two issues, you will probably enjoy this game."
1,Oh no..,"I bought this game a few months ago and have tried to play it three times and each time I couldn't get past the first training level, not because it was difficult but because I was bored out of my skull waiting for videos and the combat engine to load. The intro was great but it took to long to get the game started. My main problem with this game is the combat engine. I hate to get into a game and then stop every few seconds for the combat engine to load and then do turn based fighting using the 'wheel of fortune'. For me a game has to be smooth with as little as possible unnecessary breaks. Not my kind of game."
5,If this book doesn't get you start -- don't bother!,"I wish to tip my hat to Loriann Hoff Oberlin. She has not only written a wonderfully succinct,thorough,inspiring book on the writing industry and how to hone your own bit of the craft to help you make money in those hard times we all suffer whilst making our way to the Best Seller List; she has also given seasoned writers a creative kick in the word processor -- and as always with steady hand to help along the way should you need it. I had the distinct pleasure to meet Loriann at a signing she did in Pittsburgh,Pa. Having discovered Writing For Quick Cash only days before (reading and highlighting till my eyes saw yellow)I was completely engrossed and inspired. The book covers everything from mechanics to ideas to strategies for success (as the title states Quick Cash). She truely wishes those with the interest to be the best they can be and to be successful. Thank you Loriann! If this book doesn't get you started -- don't bother!"
3,backs would not stay on,The backs of the earrings would not stay on. I had to purchase different ones.
4,GOLD WATCH,"I bought a watch from Goldfinger jewerly a month or so ago. It did not work, I sent it back and because I don't check my email often enough I did not see the mail I got from them. They glady sent a replacement and so far the new watch is working great.I did jump the gun a bit on my last review and would like to correct it and give them a good rating. I will do business with them again if needed.I don't use the watch and bought it for my husband, who so far is very happy with it."
2,Did not work,"These we so annoying! I read the brief instructions thoroughly, and so did my husband. I tried to do some, and so did he. They attached one side of the snap well, but for the other side never worked. They did not line up the pieces right, so that no matter how hard I tried and pressed, the sharp pointy ends would end up in the wrong place and stick out of the fabric. I have no idea how to get them out now. Ruined my projects."
1,Awful.,"This tool is poor at best. The problem is the angle at which the fulcrum applies pressure. Often (every?) time I used it I ended up with crushed, distorted snaps. The snaps would leave sharp edges, not a good design.I tried light, and ""firm"" and ""very hard"" pressure with the tool... Every time wasted my time. Its going back.The directions are not too hard to understand, but they could be a lot better."
4,Sounds.,"If sound existed in space, this is what it would sound like.It makes me think of some unknown amphitheater in the middle of nowhere, while you watch random lights flicker in the distance while hearing this music. It's quite experimental, droney, and often hypnotic. Sometimes the random inserts of a maniacal laugh, laser beams, or a randomly plucked african instrument can be disenchanting, but overall I would say it a rather good ambient body of work.There are almost twenty tracks on this record, which make for a good lulling sound as you lay in bed contemplating or falling asleep. I'd compare this to Set Fire to Flames' records or even Trent Reznor's work for the original Quake soundtrack. A good buy."
4,Untouchables,"The Tri-State Gang was about a gang who were vicious killers who robbed armor truck and killed the drivers. The leader was a mad dog who would kill people for hardly any reason. In the end they get caught.The Dutch Schultz Story was about a man who gain a reputation a gang leader, extortionist, and a hustler. He seem to have the city in the palm of his hand. Then Lucky Luciano takes over, recruits Schultz's gang, and kills Dutch in the end.Both storys are good."
2,A liberal's view of the Pinochet dictatorship.,"This book begins well enough in the description of Augusto Pinochet. The first two chapters describe his early family life along with his reluctant decision to join the junta plotting the overthrow of the Allende government. The last two chapters then go into unproven killing, torture, and drug and weapons trafficing. The author tries to give us a picture of a dictator that knew everything going on in Chile. I am not sure that is the case. I do know this dictatorship in the process of overthrowing the legal Marxist government killed 3,000-4,000 people. That is a fact. I am sure torture and killings were part of the plan to stay in power. I am unsure whether they were systemic, as they are in Castro's Cuba.I don't believe this is a balanced view on Pinochet's Chile. I believe there is much truth in this book, but also stories that don't pass the muster of honest reporting."
1,Worst South Park of All!,"""South Park"" which is often quite hilarious sinks to a new and predictable low with ""Meccha Streisand"". Trashing Streisand has become tired and what is even more desperate is that there are so many little areas to jab Barbra Streisand at, but none of them are unilized here. Exactly, why do the creators hate her so much? The reasons are never explored or is it just the idea that a powerful successful woman must naturally be self-absorbed? This episode is just sad and the worst part of all is that it really isn't even very funny. Amusing at times, but certtainly not one to watch again and again."
3,I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS MOVIE 5 STARS........,"IF IT WASNT FOR THE LAST EPISODE:MECHA STREISAND.IT IS THE WORST OF ALL THE EPISODES.STARVIN MARVIS WAS AWESOME THOUGH.I HATED THE SECOND EPISODE.ONLY A COUPLE FUNNY PARTS IN THAT ONE,LIKE THE ROSHAMBO SCENE"
2,Not the same,I bought this hoping it was the same one as the one I bought for my driver's side about six months ago. It was about $6 cheaper and I could tell. It was a lot smaller and it doesn't have the flexibility to really work at the angle I need it at. It works and it's durable but I'm not pleased. I should've been more patient and waited for the original seller to get a restock of the same product. I'm not discouraging anyone from buying this I'm just saying it's not a great fit for my needs.
4,"No excess, does its job well.","Well thought-out design. Lightweight, simple to adjust, connections don't leak, keeps oscillating even without much water flow, can water small and large areas. The only thing not to like about this is that it doesn't have a timer."
1,Do Not Play,Opened these and burned a CD. Does not play in car stereo. Does not play in normal CD player. Will be returning.
3,one of the few...,"B&S outlines ive been able to read through. also read their, 'guide to bible prophecy' their masterpiece that's sadly out of publication."
2,"OK, but tedious","Sections of the book were interesting, but it didn't hold my interest. William Manchester's books on Churchill are a better investment."
3,Macmillan Is To Blame,"If you go to the author's website ... he explainshow he wrotethis book in six weeks using an alpha version. Of course there wereerrors, but despite his repeated attempts to get the publisher to correct the mistakes Macmillan refused. They went on to publish this good but flawed book for four reprints, never fixing even one typo. For a while Mr. Shafran had a support site to help people with the mistakes, but has since taken it down as his relationship with Macmillan has soured. I suggest contacting Macmillan's Support Page ... for help or to complain about this product."
3,"Interesting, but not about Washington","John Marshall was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court (1801-1835), and had a major influence on the definition of the balance of power in the new nation with the Marbury v Madison decision of 1803. He personally knew George Washington, and gives us in this book (written in 1822) a snapshot of how American history was understood at that time. The book is a very detailed history of the settling of America by first the English, and then the Pilgrims and Dutch, but it does not touch the American Revolution at all, and there is no mention of George Washington. Luckily it was free!This book is seriously mislabeled. It is marked as Volume I, so perhaps GW appears in a later volume.However, though the language is quite dated, and sometimes convoluted, it is interesting; just not what I was looking for."
5,Great reading,"Great book. It does clearly explain Yoga as the science which develops the capacity of the human mind to respond to higher vibrations. For a more in debt knowledge on vibrations, check out ""A book about you"" from the same author."
3,This is an evil book!,"I agree with the previous reviewer. This is an evil book. Not that the plot amounts to anything. And I don't really have anything against gore myself. From a literary view, the book is weak - having a wife-killer... errr... ""wife-eater"" to be more exact, as a Raskolnikov-like character who later shows moments of real kindness (possible redemption?) just doesn't work. This book permeates an evil ""feel"" - maybe because of the presence of a very real devil in it."
3,havent finished,"I havent finished with this book just yet,but it seems good. Ived read other books from this author and they are very good"
1,Horrible Book,"McNab's book, Liberation Day, is the worst book I have ever tried to wade through. First, the book is confusing. He has an obsessive/compulsive need to use acronyms for everything under the sun. Instead of simply writing out the words or describing the action, he has to use some type of code word initials that we are supposed to learn as we read. I am on page 130 and I think he has already made up about 35 or 40 of these stupid code acronyms. Thankfully, I only paid 5.95 for the book, or I would ask him to refund my money. I just wish I had a fireplace so I could use it for kindling. Hey, Andy... find a day job, you are gonna need it.By the way, Amazon needs to have 1/4 and 1/2 stars since some books can not rise to the level of getting 1 star."
3,Disappointingly slow story,"I first met Nick Stone in McNab's REMOTE CONTROL. Stone is a man of action and a guy who can take a punch or two or three, as he gets bloodied in every one of his adventures and always comes out on top. While they were very entertaining and ""fast reads,"" my own personal favorite was FIREWALL, I found LIBERATION DAY to be long on stakeouts and short on action. I remember wondering, when I was half-way through the book, whether McNab was the actual author. Something about the writing style and plotting of LIBERATION DAY seemed to be missing. While the previous books were true page turners, the last book was something of a yawner. I hope McNab goes back to the old formula when he writes the next Nick Stone adventure."
4,Pioneer Home Theater Receiver,This receiver is complicated and it will take me a while to figure it out. I am very satisfied with it. I bought it for the Super Bowl and was very impressed with the sound qaulity that it produced. This was an upgrade to my previous receiver. It has a lot of options that I will have to learn to use.
4,Great Value,"After significant due diligence, I chose this model. It has lived up to all my expectations. I went in knowing that non-hdmi connections will not upconvert and muss pass through to the same connection type. The only other weakness I have run into is the remote is limited to pre-programmed manufacturer codes, which means if yours is not on the list you are SOL. Overall, no buyer's remorse here, great product at a great price."
2,poor book,"I did have a good knowledge obout both LC oscillators and ring oscillators, this book does not give anything new or interesting about oacillators design, it is a collection of results of papers and comments on them.i was disappointed in the contents of it."
4,Engrossing thriller and hard to put down,"I loved the book! However, the character development was not up to these authors' usual level, and I thought the ending was a little contrived."
5,Just one question.,"Very good book, recommended for those who love the ""Penderghast"" series and those who don't. (I do, but hey, not for everyone). It fleshes out Nora Kelly's character a lot more and you see where she meets Smithback. I enjoyed it; you can get summaries from everyone else.Just one question. And yes, you'd do well to imagine me yelling it. WHY DOES ""THE GOOD GUY"" ALWAYS HAVE TO BE AN IDIOT AND THREATEN TO EXPOSE ""THE BAD GUY"" IN THE MIDDLE OF VERY PRECARIOUS SITUATIONS!?!??!!?That's my only problem with this book. I think I actually cursed ""the good guy"" (don't want to give anything away) out loud when I read that part. WHY??? *sobs*But yeah, very very nice."
5,Definitely not disappointing,"I first read RELIC and then went for years before I thought to check about sequels or other books. I was pleased to see a nice selection. THUNDERHEAD caught my eye because of the description so I tried it. And loved it! Great descriptions, wonderful portrayal of characters, and I even got my favorite reporter back unexpectedly. A very interesting idea about the Anasazi too."
2,Made me sad...,"Did anyone notice that this is simply a remake of Riptide in the desert with anthropologists? At the beginning of Thunderhead, I seriously feared this was going to be an academic ""Scooby-Doo"" adventure with Nora as Thelma and Smithback as Shaggy (or Scooby?) with pothunters dressed up, trying to scare off the Scooby gang. Instead, the plot takes a very dark turn. I felt that there was gratuitous violence and death that wasn't central to the plot. I am bit surprised that Preston, being such an avid horseman, would see fit to include the violent deaths of so many horses--in multiple scenes (horse lovers be forewarned). While I appreciated the academic bent and extensive research on the Anasazi, the ending was emotionally and intellectually disappointing. Preston and Child are still my favorite authors but this book left me feeling dissatisfied and sad."
4,Thunderhead,"Nora Kelly,a young and rising star archeologist receives a letter from her late father mailed 5 days earlier but written sixteen years earlier.The letter starts a quest to find Quivira, a lost Anasazi city supposedly full of gold, one of the lost seven cities of gold that Coronado had sought but returned bitter and a failure.A team is assembled and the journey starts even though Nora has been attacked by strange beast or humans dressed as beast. Thinking they are after the secret to find and loot the city no one has thought that perhaps they know the city and are trying to keep others from finding it.This was the first Preston& Child I have read and I really enjoyed it. The historical facts were on target and the added fiction was believable.I would highly recommend this to other to read."
5,RANKING UP THERE WITH THE RELIC ET AL,"This was such a terrific-and terrifying-novel. The suspense was outstanding, the gore was engrossing, and--and-- WHOEVER REVIEWED THIS AND SAID THIS WAS A KID'S TALE IS A COMPLETELY STONEBRAINED CUCKOO! THIS IS A DAMN GOOD BOOK!"
2,Disappointing,"After reading the on-line reviews, I expected something much stronger. The character development is non-existent and what should be small details, such as Nora's non-response to her dog missing and the weak ""who would you sleep with"" dialogue between Nora and Sloan, flatten the characters. This was far from the ""you won't be able to put it down"" accolades listed on the cover."
