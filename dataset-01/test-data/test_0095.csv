1,overpriced junk,"The first knife I got was broken (new). I sent it back and 1 year later, the spring that holds the knife in was shot. We only used this knife for bread and turkey (2 times a week, max). I previously bought a cheap Hamilton-Beach knife that lasted almost a decade. Basically, this is a nice looking yugo of a knife. Giving this knife one star is a stretch."
1,Knife overheated during first use,Received the knife as a wedding gift in july of 2012. Opened the knife for the first time a few days after Christmas of 2012 to slice a ham. The knife overheated to the point where the handle was too hot to hold. Finished the job with a normal knife. My instruction booklet says that cuisinart wants me to send $10 for a warranty replacement. I will do no such thing. Hopefully we aren't beyond the return window of our macy's registry.
1,Design flaw in switch,"Positives: When it worked, it performed as expected.Negatives: Underpowered for certain tasks and design flaw in switch.Since we bought this primarily for breads, some produce and occasional large cuts of meat, I was not too concerned about the reports that it seemed a tad underpowered. For breads and produce it performed well. It did bog down under large cuts of meat - holiday ham - but a proper carving knife works much better.My main complaint though is the same one other reviewers have noted: a poorly designed switch. It began to act up on occasion and eventually fell apart. For the amount of use we gave this unit, we expected much better performance. A definite recommendation to avoid."
2,"After 8-10 minutes, the handle getting DANGEROUSLY HOT!!!","I bought 2 of these knives and both have the same problem: after 8-10 minutes, I have put on a glove in order to hold the handle a second longer. It get BURNING HOT and can take 15 minutes plus to cool down and the problem re-occurs after another few minutes of use. When this happened the first time, I thought it was a fluke but it is not. I wrote Cuisinart who responded that they received my letter but offered no compensation, advice or replacement. In addition, the ""ergonomic"" handle is only ergonomic to people with hands as large as a football player's. I cannot imagine who would find that big bulbous shape at the end of the knife comfortable. I gave it 2 stars because while it is cool, it does cut well."
1,Believe the Reviews,"This knife worked fine for a few months, then it became more and more difficult to create a good connection while operating the trigger mechanism. It now functions very eratically, and I usually resort to a standard knife to avoid the hassle. The positive comments that you read in the reviews are accurate. How many of them report having had the knife for a year or more, and it's still working fine, however? Maybe some of them are constructed well and are, in fact, durable. I chose to believe that the problems reported in the reviews were flukes, and got butned."
1,This is really awful,"I bought this to upgrade my 40 year old knife. I have been a Cuisinart fan for years. The reviews here are accurate:Sharp- yes - DON'T change the blades with the knife plugged in. THIS IS REALLY DANGEROUS due to the hair trigger button.Nice looking - absolutely, nice package and storage.Smells aweful - yes - a smell that reminds me of my electric model train from the 60sJunk - YES. I believe so.I am disappointed with the quality and performance of this product. Much of this is covered in reviews here already. At the reduced price point its a hassle to send back....I just will think twice before buying a Cuisinart product again."
3,Luck of the draw,The first knife I received didn't last very long. It seems the knife blades release button was faulty and the housing wasn't properly glued. It all fell apart.The knife was quickly replaced and this one seems to be fine so far...
1,Don't Buy This Product!,"Bought this knife to use for Thanksgiving. Wanted to test it before the holiday, so tried slicing a loaf of bread. First I had trouble getting the blades to lock in. After using the knife for just a few minutes, it started to smell (like burning electrical wires). The motor area became very hot. After only one use, I am now unable to remove the blades. I am afraid I will cut off my fingers trying.This is one of the worst purchases I have ever made. Thought Cuisinart was supposed to be a good brand. Reading some of the other reviews below, it sounds like this knife may work well only for a very short time. Not for me! Obviously there are both design and manufacturing flaws involved.This product should be removed from the market."
5,Excellent product,More powerful than other electric knives I've used. Cuts easily through cold meats. Well designed and comfortable to use.
5,Great Slicing,"Years ago I had a wonderful electric knife. When it played out, I bought another which was never very satisfactory. It quit working and I was glad to look for another electric knife. Since I have been pleased with all my other Cuisinart appliances and what I read sounded as if the knife would be just what I wanted, I ordered it. I have been very pleased with my selection. The knife works beautifully."
4,WOW No Axe Murder Should be Without This,I am turly impressed with this Cusineart Electric Knife. I have used it to carve roasts and turkeys and it makes slicing easy and allows the user to make nice consist thickness slices. A must have for cooks with roasterphonia! Required gear for funeral homes and abatoir employees.
4,All Family Gift,"I bought one of these for each of our 5 children after using mine for 4 years with great success. You do have to be careful to put the knife bases into the right slots. So take time to look at the instruction booklet before you use the first time. Works great on roasts, hams, & bread."
5,You get what you pay for!,"This is, by far, the best electric knife I have ever used! I have tried many others that cost between 10.00 and 30.00 and all they did was chew whatever you were cutting into pieces. I have come to believe greatly that you get what you pay for. I have used the knife to cut meat and bread. The knife blades are so sharp that they can cut through hot bread without mashing or creating a pile of dust from the crust. My mother has borrowed it because the electric knife she owns just can't ""cut it""..haha. I think I will order her one of her own for Christmas this year. You won't regret this purchase..look at it this way..you can spend 50.00 now and never have to worry about getting another electric knife or you can spend 20.00 and be back looking for another one in a year."
1,Junk,"The motor is great and the blades are exceptional -- if only I could get it to work.The poor quality of the PLASTIC on/off safety pin became evident shortly after I purchased this electric knife. After sliding the pin to the ON position, I would have to play with it to get it in exactly the right position so that the knife would start working.When the pin broke (after only a few uses), I was still able to push in the bottom grip and it was a crap shoot. Sometimes the knife would work even without the on/off switch and the safety pin.It smoked a little and smelled like hell, but at least I got my roast sliced."
1,Worthless,"This knife lasted less than 2 years with little use. I paid for the name and it did me no good. My old Hamilton Beach one lasted 27 years! Cuisinart said they could tell by serial # it was past the 3 year warranty but if I could give them a receipt, they would honor it. How convenient. I'm headed back to WalMart this time to buy the cheap ones that last."
3,"OK, not great","Well, it's working so far, which I guess is more than I can say for some of the other reviewers. The knife has an artful look, for what that's worth, but it doesn't feel particularly well cosntructed. The blades do not fit securely, which results in a weak and wobbly cut. I have cut a ham and a roast with it so far. In both cases I had to apply a lot of my own strengh to cut through the meat, which caused some bowing in the blades. My old and much cheaper Black & Decker knife actually performed much better than this knife."
1,Not Worth the Money,"Paid $50 for the Cuisinart CEK-40 electric knife. After about 6 uses the knife stopped working. On/off switch had failed, poorly designed. I would not buy another Cuisinart knife."
2,Electric knife,"Its ok, it overheats fast. I bought it to cut three to four steaks into strips but it cant keep up with this type of demand. It should be perfect for cutting two slices from a loaf of bread."
1,Good for cutting Jello... otherwise its junk.,Don't buy it unless your cutting Jello. Its junk. Cuisinart should be embarrassed.I bought the Cuisinart CEK-40 Electric Knife for cutting our annual turkey. The gears became more and more stripped towards the end of the first turkey. I exchanged it for a new one and it cut out on the second use occasionally working and was completely unusable on our third year for the same reason. A stripped gear! The motor keeps running at a louder pitch but the knife stops moving. There is a plastic gear part on the inside that easily becomes stripped on this unit.!!Any good reviews were either written when the unit may have had better parts or after the customers first use!!I've blacklisted the Cuisinart brand from our kitchen because of this product. Test your products Cuisinart! My respect for your products has been greatly lowered.
1,piece of crap,"I've had TWO of these knives. First one gave out shortly after first uses, second one slowed down and gave off a burning ozone smell like it was about to burst into flames. I have a multitude of Cuisinart products and I am sorry to say, this product is a DISASTER. RUN AWAY. Do not buy this plastic piece of headache. Unfortunately the site won't let me rate this worthless dangerous fire hazard as a no, zero, zilch, star."
2,Not Up to Expectation,I bought the Cuisinart knife for a Christmas present. We used it every now and again for a couple of years. Then the blades stopped moving even though the motor was running. Stripped gears. I was disappointed that it had broken down so quickly. I called Cuisinart to see if they would exchange but they would not. I will try a different brand this time.
1,poorly made,"I have had three of these knives, they work very well until the trigger switch breaks. The switch seems designed from light weight plastic and lasts for maybe 25 uses. I bought it because of the Cuisinart name but after three tries, never again."
2,Ugh! So So!!,"Poorly made product - Motor gears (plastic) broke while cutting meats and fruit. Did not last long. I'd opt for an alternate, the next time."
2,Not very reliable,"This Cuisinart knife is beautiful and worked fine, when it worked. After about two years of very light service, the trigger started failing to start the knife action. I tried everything to correct the electrical problem. For awhile, I could get it started by pulling on the electrical cord while holding the handle down, hard against the counter top. Finally, nothing would make it start running. I also tried disassembling it to find the loose connection. Disassembly turned out to be very difficult so I gave up."
1,Broken after five uses,"We have only used our knife about five times. We had the same problem as the other reviewer, where the blades stopped moving and the motor was fine. Unlike the other reviewer, we never got it hooked on bones or anything else. It simply stopped moving. We didn't bother to open up the housing. Sad to have to add it to the landfill."
3,Why you should give an author another chance...or two...,"I've read other books by M.T Anderson and I always hated them or never even bothered to finish them. That's why I was so surprised by my interest into this story right from the beginning. We follow Gregory and Brian, best friends, to Gregory's ""Uncle's"" house in rural Vermont during a school vacation. Little do the boys know how strange old Uncle Max has become, and what is waiting for them in the upstairs nursery. It's an old board game, and they're playing if they like it or not. The characters are great (Gregory is a bit of a blonde) and the writing really helps convey the strange spots the boys find themselves in."
2,"Pure, unimaginable BOREDOM!","This book has about one or two mildly interesting parts, but it reminds me too much on Jumanji. This book was recommended to me by a friend, and after reading the book, i wanted to hit him! This book was hideously boring and confusing as times. Once i put it down, it fealt like i was taking a VERY heavy burden off of my shoulders. I reccomend that you do not read this book."
4,A Must Read For Anyone Going Into Business,"There are many books the shelves for the seasoned executive wanting to enhance his or her skills, but very few for the new executive crop.Mark McCormack gives straightforward, no nonsense advise on the subtly of business that is not taught in ANY business school. The reader gets invaluable insights into the world of ""the street smart executive"" and how to immediately improve their people skills. While some of McCormack's ""notes"" may seem obvious to an experienced executive, the lessons are great examples of how interpersonal dealings can either make or break a business relationship. I highly recommend this book to anyone that wants to save the pain of trial by fire as they make their way through the corporate world. This is a must read for anyone wanting to be a ""street smart executive""."
4,Great Book for the Right Audience,"The content within this book provides general information for someone new to the workplace or to someone that has owned their own company and not been exposed to the daily challenges within the workplace. I read this book 15 years ago and I still think of many of the lessons often. I do recommend it for the right audience. If you've been in business for much time, you will not find it helpful."
1,not very good,"Mark seems to be consumed with himself. This book spends more time on personal examples of deals Mark made than any sort of technique that can help you. There are some good points, but I think you'd be better off with Steven Covey or Tony Robbins.."
3,It absolutely should be a university text...,"...because it's full of useful information in a format that can be summed up thusly: ""Blah, blah, blah, listen to my fascinating anecdotes, blah, blah, blah."" Sounds like a lot of textbooks I can think of."
2,Not well-written,"This book skips around and doesn't have a clear plot. The author goes from one character to another, one scene to another with no transitions or space breaks, causing confusion."
2,DVR Screech,"I purchased this DVR 3 years ago. After a couple of weeks it developed this high pitch screech when starting. I didn't mind as long as the player and recorder worked well. About 3 months ago, the player stopped working. So, I did get about 2 1/2 years out of the recorder. However, I will not by another magnavox soon. I did a search on the internet and found that other buyers have had the same screeching sound with other magnavox dvd players/recorders."
2,frequent disc errors,"I've had this recorder for about a year and have had mixed results from the beginning. The dvd's it produced would often not play on various dvd players. Originally thought the problem was that some of the players were older and couldn't handle the formatting done by the magnavox, but over time I've found that sometimes the magnavox output DOES play on the older dvd players and sometimes it doesn't. Most recently I've found the same is true for playback on new dvd players and even pc's. It's a crapshoot if these dvd's are going to playback on anything except the magnavox. Most recently I've started getting alot of errors in it's loading up a blank dvd or finalizing a recorded dvd. Very annoying after you've spent hours recording a program to only have to start over again. Although this machine was OK while it lasted it's life is way too short and the time wasted on do-overs outweighs the good dvd's it managed to produce."
5,TEA ROSE PERFUME,I GOT A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS WHEN WEARING THE PERFUME. IT'S ALITTLE STRONG INITIALLY WHEN IT'S SPRAYED ON BUT TAPERS OFF IN A FEW SECONDS.
2,Smells like roses but it's too strong. SMELLS CHEAP,"It certainly smells like roses but its overpowering and far too strong. Higher quality perfumes tend to be more subtle and this was more like a room spray with spicy undertones. I read some of the other negative reviews and they claim this EDT smells different than the perfume, so perhaps this is why there are so many positive reviews. It doesn't smell as bad as other cheap perfumes because the smell of alcohol is faint, but its not a pleasant smell and the lack of the alcohol scent was its only strong point, even the bottle looks cheap. I ended up giving mine away to a thrift store. I have found other perfumes under $20 that smell like higher quality perfumes but this wasn't one of them. Don't make the same mistake as me and buy it based on reviews. Smell this before you buy it to make sure you like it."
4,Wonderful wordless book,"My daughter loves to read this book before bedtime. Because there are no words, it requires a little creativity from the reader, but that is the fun of it. Tafuri's illustrations of the jungle scenes are wonderful and the storyline captures any young dreamer's imagination."
5,Jimi Hendrix was a genius!,"If you are a fan of Jimi Hendrix then do yourself a favor and buy this 4 disc set! I could not believe my ears when I heard these versions of the songs I've loved for years. Jimi was an artist, every note that comes off the guitar is poetry. Best song on the album Disc 2, Track 7, Bold as Love!!!!! I listen to it at least twice everyday. No words, just music...If I haven't convinced you, read the other reviews..."
3,mediocre,"I have to concur with other reviewers. This book is disappointing and over-priced. It is not very user-friendly and lacks good maps. It is better than nothing and includes a personal touch. For example, it warns you which campsites tend to be noisy and over-run with tourists. But overall, I wanted more information on particular areas -- especially regarding lodging and dining options and better maps. I'm still looking for a good Michigan guide."
3,Hard to play with,My son HAD TO HAVE Star wars toys for Christmas so I bought this thinking he would love it. He has only played with it once. It is difficult to transform and he needs help. He likes the action figures much better.
5,a nice can opener,"One of the best openers we have ever owned. sould we ever have need for another can opener,I'm sure we will surely look @ the Cuisinart brand."
3,Prokofiev Fantasy,"This is a 53 minute dramatization, based upon the orchestral story of Peter and the wolf. The producer used a combination of puppets, actors and musical instruments to portray the drama. He used the Chamber Orchestra of Europe in the music episodes. About 35 - 40 minutes relates to this well known subject, the remainder of which portrays some elements of Prokofiev's experiences. I had to turn up the volume on my VCR to its loudest, and it still was a little low. Some liberal interpretation is used. The wolf is eventually captured and taken to a circus. The duck is portrayed as a drunkard, carrying a bottle with him as he swims about the pond. After being swallowed by the wolf he is shown in the belly puffing on a cigar. I was planning to use portions of the video for elementary classroom instruction, but hesitate due to the intemperate duck. Might have been better off with the cheaper version of Peter and the Wolf."
2,"I love Tupperware, BUT...","Maybe it's just me, but this little gadget just didn't work for me. I tried to decorate some cookies, but you have to have so much frosting in it to get it to come out smoothly, that it just doesn't work for little jobs. Plus, I found it kind of a mess cleaning it up. Maybe if I were frosting an entire cake and had the ball full of frosting it would have worked better. Too bad, because it's a great idea! I think the problem is that the ball is not flexible enough to work with small amounts of frosting. As with all Tupperware products, the quality of the plastic is very good--it just needs a little refinement."
4,Arrived promptly and in good condition,"I was pleased with the stand, however, had difficulty putting it together as the pieces didn't want to go together very easily. I was most disappointed with the false advertising. It was advertised as free standing but clearly is not. Intructions infatically stated that the unit must be fastened to the wall, which would, by the way, lift the front off the floor. Otherwise, the design is nice and will watch not to put anything too topheving on it. I would not recommend this product as a free standing unit.Thank you,Leslie Ballard."
5,I Once Watched It 10 Times In A Weekend!,What can I say? Everything about this film is perfect. Every detail. The casting. Dialogue. Cinematography. The kind of movie that is so filled with hilarious tiny details that each time you notice something new and love it even more.
5,Classic,"I loved this movie when it first came out, back in my own post-punk college days. I recently watched it again, after not having seen it for many years, and I'm pleased that it has actually aged quite well. It's still really, really funny. The soundtrack is still excellent. The social commentary still works. The performances are still hysterical. The special effects are still bad. Seriously, it's a classic."
4,"Gives ""unconventional"" a good name","What do aliens, punk rock, no-name food, and repossessing cars have in common? This film tries -- and succeeds! -- in answering the question.Veteran weird-movie guy Harry Dean Stanton stars with Emilio Estevez in this completely unconventional and at times downright bizarre film that nonetheless entertains from beginning to end.Anyone who thinks that movies these days are too ""formula"" will find the film of their dreams in ""Repo Man""."
4,DVD is NOT the mellonfarmer version,"Despite the excellent quality of this DVD (typically excellent Anchor Bay production values), this version of the film is sadly the edited one: the scene where Bud cons Otto into signing the Malibu over to him is missing as is the bit where Duke says 'have a nice day...night...day'. I haven't watched my old taped from the TV version for some time, but I have the feeling Miller's lines are trimmed a tad also.However, the film remains unmissable in this widescreen version and the sound is particularly excellent (Iggy Pop's 'Repo Man' theme has never sounded more exciting). But for those of you used to the far funnier use of 'melonfarmer'...this truncated version might not please the purist, hence my four star rating."
4,Great Anthology of this Under-appreciated Composer,"Menotti was one of the most important opera composer's of the twentieth century. This CD compiles his shorter, more well-known works. ""The Telephone,"" ""The Medium"" are performed with the original casts and the recording quality is pretty good.For a library or serious student of opera, this CD is worth adding to your collection, as well as those who would like to explore more recent operas of our time."
4,Devotions for Morning and Evening with Mrs. Charles Cowman,"I have read different devotionals, but this is by far the best! What I love about this particular book~~it's two devotionals in one! In the morning I read a devotional and before I retire for the evening I can read more ""refreshing"" words penned by Mrs. Cowman.Mrs. Cowman was ""wise beyond her years"". I cannot tell you the times I have read her devotional and felt like I had been in touch with heaven itself."
3,2nd times a charm,"First shipment of this product came with missing pieces...I returned and received a new one. The 2nd shipment came in the original box, however, looked liked it had been through the ringer. Inside were all the parts, but instructions for a Thomas the Tank Engine toy. All worked out ok, because the net was easy to figure out. However, if I am buying a new product, I would like to receive a new product."
2,Way too small to play with!,"I picked this up from a garage sale for around $2.00, and even that price was a waste. I bought it for my then 5 year old boys and it was still way too small to do anything with. They still had to bend down to hit the sticks. And mom, on my knees. I guess if you have younger children or are playing this indoors it might be more fun, but it's not any fun outside on the driveway, it's just too short and too small to enjoy, even for a 5 year old!!"
3,Nice Try...,"Although this is a reasonable attempt at a biography it suffers from the same fate as all biographies on Sting - no cooperation or input from the subject himself. So you are left with what appears to be regurgitated interviews, reviews, articles and general gossip as source material. That said, the book is innocous enough, has a few b&w photographs and covers Sting's career up until the end of the Amnesty shows in 1988. Three stars, mainly for effort."
2,Poor Design,"This machine gave out within 6 months of purchase. The pause and serve didn't work which caused coffee to pour out onto the base and over the side. Because the timer and clock function is on the bottom, the liquid caused a short of the electrical systems. It started with just the clock going crazy, but ultimately, all the electronic functions gave out. No one can fix these machines besides Cuisinart, so we just decided to buy another. Would never buy another Cuisinart machine, nor a coffee maker with the clock and electrical functions on the bottom."
5,Just Listen,"Just listen:That's all you have to do. Do not do anything else, other than open your ears, your mind, and your lungs. Lie back. Turn off the lights. Tune into Amacher.She'll take you to another place.And when you come back, you'll feel better.Promise."
1,"Looks nice, but gears break easily","We purchased the Cuisinart SmartPower blender for smoothies and light duty blending duties. It's a nicely designed unit , very stable on the countertop, but very poor quality gear drive. After a couple dozen uses, the motor gear wheel broke, apparently a common problem on these Cuisinarts, as noted by other reviewers. Cuisinart customer service is worthless - it costs more to ship and repair the unit than to replace it.Replaced the worthless Cuisinart with a Kitchenaid. Would recommend avoiding Cuisinart blenders due to this gear design flaw."
5,Blue Rider,Brought back so many wonderful memories of the 70's and the special person who introduced me to the music and the life I was meant to live.
4,"Delicious, as always","I love, and will always love, Lizano salsa!My sole reason for only four out of five stars is that the bottle is very small. I should have known that when I ordered it by actually researching the size, but I didn't realize how small it would be!"
5,Metro Backpack,"I purchased this backpack for my 17"" laptop - which it said it would fit. After getting it home and trying it, it was clearly not designed to fit a 17"" - maybe a 15"" max. Overall quality was excellent and if I had a 15"" laptop, this would be a great bag."
1,HORRIBLE,backpack looks great. BUT! shipping was horrible. my ogio came with a huge rip in the front.ruined my first week of college. had to carry my books and buy a new backback.so much for this.
1,Useless,An absolutely worthless book. I spent 10 minutes leafing through it and then promptly returned to Amazon for a refund.
4,50 Strategies for ELL students,gave it 4 stars and passed it onto our ELL teacher. Gave information on ELL students and strategies to help them. Gave me what I wanted.
1,"Catastrophic purchase, really unhappy!","I bought two headsets: one for my computer at work (Vista), one for home (XP). The microphone doesn't work on either. I guess that if I had slightly more advanced computer knowledge I could find a fix, but this should be plug and play, and it's anything but.In addition, the headset actually damaged (to be precise, destroyed) the USB port on one computer. It's as if it ""ate"" the pins of the USB port, making it unuseable.This was the most expensive type of headset in the store. What a terrible purchase."
2,Logitech Stereo USB Headset 250,"Comfy, easy to use but poor voice quality. We had intended to use this at editing stations for student video projects that they need to be 'voiced-over'. Voice quality was poor so we had to remove it and replace it with a better quality USB mic. Too bad."
2,saskfarm,"Not up to my expectation, the sound was not clear and hard to understand, head piece was uncomfortable to wear. for the price I expected more!"
3,How big's your head?,"Inexpensive.Installed without a hitch.Nice quality recorded sound.Good earpads.Only real complaint: With even just a moderately large head (I wear a 7-3/8"" hat), this headset is tight enough to make my ears ache after an hour or so of use."
3,headache,"I am giving this headset 3 stars because it is not consisten in its performance. it worked great for about 5 days....After that started acting up. Sometimes I loose people, or people loose me. It has good cancelling noise feature for the price. The sound can be good on it, but not always. I wish I had not bought it, but I will use it for a while on Skype and to let my kids scream."
2,Great until you drop it,"Two drops from my desk to a carpeted (padded) floor). Result was each earpiece separated from its holder. It still works, but there is nothing to hold it together except the wires and they will not last very much longer.Standard industry drop test is 10 feet to concrete. They dropped the ball on this one."
3,Earpiece not so comfortable..,I have had this headset for a while. The headset works great but the earpiece fits on your ears so tight and there is not much cushioning effect. So you tend to get uneasy if you are using this for about 30 mins or so. Thats the reason I took out 2 stars as I feel they should have a comofrtable feel when you put them on.
1,Does not work well with Intel Macs,"I would avoid buying this headset if you are planning to use it on an Intel Mac. Mine worked for a while on my MacBook then started turning the sound into blobs of distorted audio or cutting out all together. I've Googled this and it seems to be a problem for others who claim Logitech wasn't helpful.On the other hand, I bought a set of Logitech V10 USB Notebook speakers ""used"" this week and so far they are GREAT so I'm not slamming the whole company here."
4,"simple and great headset, but this $90 price is ridiculous","If this is what it looks like -- the simple, silver plastic usb logitech headset that has no volume device on the cord -- then it is the best headset that I have ever used, and it is more comfortable and better than the ""premium"" ones that they released that have the large annoying dangling volume control.BUT, now it looks like nobody carries them anymore so there is one Amazon partner that has them listed at $90 each? PLUS $20 shipping? that is way more than the original fee and they are not THAT good that they should be marked up so incredibly high.Looks like someone has a strategy to squeeze money out of a few un-informed shoppers... These should cost maybe $40. or less."
2,Sweat and More Sweat,"If you like your ears and your earphones to be wet then i suggest you buy it otherwise, stay away the sound i think is wonderful, but it DOES NOT HAVE A MUTE BUTTON OR VOLUME CONTROL. I suggest buying the logitech clear comfort headset has everything you're looking for minus the wetness."
5,USB stereo headset is great,The headset is great and the USB port usage is wonderful. I have used the headset almost every day and the sound is wonderful.
2,Broken after few months of infrequent usage,"Sound quality is adequate, but ear-cup connection is too fragile. Headphones got broken after a few months of infrequent usage."
4,Sturdy and clear,"This headset is all one needs to make voip calls. It sounds clear when chatting and People say they can hear me clearly. It is also adequate for music. One last big benefit of this headset is also its USB, which you can plug to any desktop or Laptop USB port quite easily. The only complaint is this thing gets very hot in your ears and it does pinch against my ear if you used for more than half an hour. Over all very good buy."
3,Good sound but sore ears,"I bought these to use with Skype. I thought the functionality was great, and the sound was very good, but in the end I found my ears started to hurt after about an hour becuase they didn't fit well around my ears. I also decided to go back to a plug style headset with one ear piece. I didn't like that it would take 15 to 20 seconds for the headphones to become active after I plugged them in. With the plug type of headset, I can just plug in to my headphones plug on my speakers, and the switch is immediate. I'm now using the Plantronics 50, and it works better."
3,Am I the only one who is bothered by this?,"This is the 4th book in the McNally's series, and I've read them in sequence. They're highly formulaic but still enjoyable. The main character continues to be a lovable rogue, mostly amoral but still with certain personal limits, so it is not surprising that he sleeps with various available women in the first 3 books.But -- SPOILER ALERT -- in this one he sleeps with a woman who is married, living with her husband and planning to continue that way. And -- lest you think that he was momentarily carried away by passion -- he sleeps with her two more times.Suddenly, to this reviewer at least, McNally has become a less lovable and much more unattractive figure."
1,"A tasteless, poorly plotted, written blabblabblab!","Reading this McNally's series was just like you were stopped by an unemployed, drunken senile English Butler in the street. He stopped you and enforced you hear out his tasteless, nonsense adventure stories. When you heard him out patiently, you found that you have idiotically wasted your precious time which might be more productive if could spent in bird watching. This series is like OLD WIVES' TALES, making you feel like living in 19 century with lot of empty whisky bottles littered around you. There was nothing worth reading in this series, my friend, the great L.Sanders has long gone, this one is but a shadow of that great writer"
3,A little less book that I anticipated ......,"I felt a little like I was reading a small children's book, the size is about 4x4, one focus point per page. It's ok ....."
4,Perfect Feng Shui Handbook for Beginners,"This is a great book. I bought one for myself and my friend. Its simple, easy to understand, and well organized. If you are just beginning to learn Feng Shui this is a great place to start. It is very specific."
5,awesome,"this is one of the coolest, well illustrated comics I've ever seen. I wish someone would pull there head out and do another print run for issue 6 though. I don't want to pay 300 bucks for it, especially when it's gonna be in a different language."
3,Geared towards college kids,"There are a couple of good DIY instructions, like how to make your own ottoman, but you can find similar guides in a magazine or on-line. The majority of the ideas are way too juvenile looking for my taste. Unfortunately, I won't be keeping this book."
3,it works,the minutes and seconds are sort of a joke and I doubt you could close a ROW survey with it but it worked for what I needed it for on the day I needed it. I don't think I'll ever attempt to use it as a level.
3,A Kiss to ... forget,"I have read a couple of great stories from this author so I decided to splurge on the $6.99 Kindle price tag for this book. Big mistake.The story was so generic and bland I didn't even recognize it as Ms. Medeiros' work. The character development was just okay, no definitive chemistry was explained to understand the emotional or sexual attraction between the duke and his ""tenant.""The tertiary story, involving the duke's cousin and his best friend's romance, was 11 years in the making and summed up/all was forgiven in one paragraph. There was potential there but it, too, was undeveloped.I'm sure many people think this story is five-star worthy due to the pseudo-fairy tale content and happily-ever after ending; however, it left me wishing for something more substantial."
4,Basic Specs and Prices,"This is the ""blue book"" for tractors.What this book has: Model, new price, Estimated used price(3), Engine Manufactorer, # of cylinders, Cu. inch displacement, # of speeds, PTO HP, Approximate shipping weight, Cab(y/n, heat/AC) comment.What this book does not have: Any pictures.It is, what it is and no more."
1,ACDelco 213-1622 Mass Airflow Sensor,This was the second sensor I ordered. The first one had not work and this one was no better. I ended up junking the car.
2,Contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate & Perfume,"Do a search on line for sodium laureth sulfate toxidity. Two ingredients on the bottle are listed as Plant Derived Surfactants & Perfume (I was under the impression there was no added fake perfume from the product description, but I definately noticed the chemicalness & irritation upon using the dishsoap). I called the company and was told the perfume ingredient on the list of ingredients was indeed chemical (man made, not essential oils as the others listed). ""Plant derived surfactants"" is what companies put on their labels when using sodium laurel sulfate or sodium laureth sulfates (the two that you should avoid). There are non toxic plant derived cleaners that suds, but companies will list the actual name as they have nothing to hide.I gave this product 2 stars, one for great cleaning and one for their customer service."
2,unpleasant odor,"I couldn't clean my toilets often enough when I got Mrs. Meyer's rose & geranium cleaner.... it made the whole bathroom smell lovely. Now I see that it is just geranium..... but I still like it.HOWEVER, I bought lemon Verbena scented dish soap and I think it is horrible. It suds ok but the smell is weird. I have had Lemon Verbena hair products from another manufacturer and it is a delightful odor so I know it is not that I might not like that particular scent. Now I am afraid to try any other of your products!"
1,Not 100% natural,I thought this was supposed to be a natural product but it has artificial fragrances and it really bothered my hands since I have mild eczema. Very disappointed since the labeling was misleading.
4,good product,"I don't understand why everyone is omparing this to an ipod. They are both good choices but these reviews are supposed to be for the Samsung. Overall, the Samsung seems like a pretty good player. It's got some cool features like the radio and the option to record what you hear on the radio. It looks good and works well. While it may have some problems, that's to be expected. These problems don't mean this player is a peice of garbage, you just have to deal with them. Stop whining, this is a good player for a good price. While there are other choices out there, this seems like a pretty good one to me."
1,Buy some thing else,To start the FM receiver is weak and the tramsmitter is even worse. I can have the player next to the antenna and it still gets over powered by local stations. I never got any downloads from napster and didn't care for about all of the songs that came preloaded. I had to send it back to Samsung because I had problems tranfering music files. It won't do some tranfers unless your logged on to Napster. There was no mention that you needed to be logged on to transfer music. When I got it back I still had trouble tranfering files. One of the worst purchases I have made. The only good thing is that Samsung has good tech support and customer service personel.
1,Software Problem,Generally Samsung MP3 players are very weak because of their poorly designed softwares. I bought YP-925GS and had to return it because of software issues and this unit uses the same software. I have been given Samsung MP3 players in the past for free and same issues with poor software.
1,This processor is not user-friendly...,"Although the DLC-1BC Mini-Prep Food Processor chops and processes food well enough, the safety system makes this processor difficult to use. The safety system prevents the motor from running unless the base is in a certain position, along with the lid being closed and also locked in a certain postion. This is impossible to do with one hand. It is often extremely difficult to with both hands. At times, the lid can be closed in what seems to be the correct position, yet the safety still prevents operation of the processor."
4,Tupperware Shaker,"I use this shaker for protein shakes, and it works well, in that there are usually no clumps. I have no idea why this was so pricey though. Nevertheless, it works well."
1,unusable,I ordered 2 containers. When they came the lids did not fit on either container and the small caps did not fit either. A rip off. Suggest you not buy this product!
3,WAY smaller than I thought it'd be,"its the size of a basketball basically.i went to target and bought a big ball like the ones they have at my gym for $9.so yeah overall i do regret buying this. but it was good while it lasted.it did relieve my back pains and strains, and its very durable and strong."
2,Urrgh,"Disappointed, that's my first reaction. As an avid David Mead fan.. and owner of his entire canon of works... as I marched around one of my usual music/retail stores desperately trying to find something worthy the other night... I saw the new Mead album and without even thinking, looking or sampling ran to the register, then to my car to load the CD. I kept listening, waiting for the sounds that would seem as good or better than his last CD, Indiana. And then the music stopped after 6 songs... and I was like, ""WHAT!?"" Sorry. Disappointment was all I mostly felt... and kinda pissed. I had no idea it was a ""mini album."" Guess I have to give it a thorough listen again. I'm sure it has some redeeming value. But Indiana-or-better it ain't, and on top of it, it's short too! Feh!! Come on David, let's go forward and stop staring at the rear-view mirror. Your music is way too vibrant to even consider retrospectives yet!!!"
4,A solid Bible reference for the casual Bible student.,"This volume is a fine resource for the reader who wishes to delve a bit deeper into Biblical study, but feels intimidated by the commentaries published specifically for use by pastors and theologians. It's an easy read--two words one seldom associates with a reference book--beautifully illustrated, with plenty of background information to give the biblically challenged a flavor for the times in which the Bible was written. I have recommended this volume and its companion, Eerdmans Handbook to the History of Christianity, since their initial release. I continue to do so, especially with this more affordable paperback edition."
1,Author Believes Bible to be Inaccurate,"...""the first few chapters of the Bible and many parts of the Old Testament are historically unreliable"" (pg. 24).This is the premise from which the author is working."
2,Broken piece of garbage,"Well the blender still works. No cracks in the base there like others have reported. It's glass and heavy and seems to work very well still. The food processor on the other hand has cracked multiple times. If fell on a plastic tile floor and broke off a small piece. It also cracked when my wife put the feeding tube piece in backward and pressed slightly. This was a $100 wedding gift we thought would last longer than a year considering our regard for the brand. No longer. ""Cuisinart"" now means ""Cuisinjunk"" to us."
2,The Blender is nice,"I received this item as a Christmas gift, and was so excited I could not wait to use it. The first two days it worked great, and the blender was excellent. The third day, while attempting to grate cheese, the safety mechanism broke off, and the food processor motor burned out. The blender worked great, but I didn't really need another one of those. So I returned the whole thing. My advice, spend a few extra dollars and get two separate appliances."
2,Love It Until The Motor Dies,"We received this blender for our wedding, and used it for blending smoothies and crushing ice for drinks. We loved it until the motor quit suddenly within the first year. The store was kind enough to replace it, and we loved our second one for almost six months, when it died. We exchanged it again, but it also died within a year. We just celebrated our third anniversary, and have gone through three SmartPower Duets in that time. I know, it sounds like we abuse the blender, ask it to blend rocks, beat it with a baseball bat, but the truth is we only use it for fruit, ice, and juice. In my opinion, a blender should be able to handle this.I would NOT recommend this product unless Cuisinart does something about making the motor last longer than a year. You'll be buying a new one soon!"
3,Works well but very loud,"I bought this dual product based on a previous purchase of the Cuisinart blender as well as a recommendation of a friend. My previous blender worked (still works in fact) very well for the five years I owned it. I took this into consideration when purchasing this dual unit.I have not had any issues using the blender or the food processor. The blender is a bit loud but it is a blender. The food processor on the other hand really does require ear plugs as others have noted.I purchased a dual unit as I have a very small kitchen and did not really have much use for a food processor. Now that I have one, I would love to use it but I feel bad for using it in worry that I will bother my neighbors.In retrospect, I would probably save my pennies and when I had a larger kitchen, buy a separate unit."
1,AWFUL!,"In the effort to save space we settled for this dual blender/processor. It was great for about 1 usage and then the food processor wouldn't work. It first whined so loud my dog went and hid upstairs in the closet until I was finished. The next time I tried to use it, the blade wouldn't fit into the processor container. When it finally fit, it wouldn't actually turn the blade. Everything was positioned correctly, but it still to this day won't turn.Don't buy this. Awful."
1,Worst Blender I've ever used,"This is my first time I've ever taken the time to write a review - but I can't say enough bad things about this blender.It is loud! 4 doors closed, and it still manages to wake the baby up as the sound permeates every inch of the house and to my inner soul.It smells! After every blend you get the smell of burnt rubber but it's just the heavy duty motor.It spills! Every time I try to pour a smoothy I manage to get a large part of it to spill down the edge. Never had this problem with the el cheapo blenders.Difficult to attach! If you don't get the food processor blade to seat just right, when you try to put it onto the motor things just latch up. I end up having to pull out all of the food - wiggle the shaft loose, and then start over again.Only good thing I can say about this thing is that it looks nice on the counter top. Just don't try to use it. I often resort back to the Braun food processor I bought for $20."
1,Stay away from this blender,"My wife and I have a blended shake everyday with ice, protein, fruit, water, and yogurt. We've had this blender for about six months and from the very begining we wanted to throw it against the wall for one very simple reason - it doesn't do it's job. It takes a very long time to ""crush"" ice. The reason I say ""crush"" is becuase it doesn't really crush it unless you let it run for over 5 mins. That's too long for a blender. It also leaks from the bottom. I've tried everything to stop it from leaking. Cleaning it is a pain as well. This product sucks!"
2,Not the best...,"I used the food processor once, and it was OK. A little hard to get the lid on & off, but otherwise OK. The next time I went to use it (this would be the second time), the lid would NOT come off. After an hour of trying everything to extract my poor food, my boyfriend had to get out a hammer to pry the darn thing apart. I don't really ever use the blender, so I'm not an expert there, although when I did use it, it didn't seem to do the best job.I would definitely recommend getting separate products to do the different jobs. I tried to save money, and it back-fired, because now I have wasted $100."
1,A Mess of a Product,"The food processor piece was flimsy and was trash within a week. The blender wasn't very strong and made an awful smell when in use. After a few months, the blender piece loosened up and leaked and it all fell apart and wound up unfixable, unreturnable trash. Avoid at all costs."
1,Motor broke right away ...twice,"I'm not one to write bad reviews but this machine ticked me off. Got it for Christmas motor broke in 2 months just from 10 smoothies and 2 uses on the food processor. I returned it to the store they gave me a brand new one. Only used it twice and it smells like smoke when I use it. I'm NOT hard on my appliances and I know what can or cant do in it, but this thing cant chop ice. PLEASE don't waste your money, these other reviews about a bad motor are very true"
2,not worth much,"After owning several Cuisinart appliances I've come to the conclusion that they are the worst on the market. Bad design, lousy functionality...not a good buy.The body of this is plastic, the lip that locks onto the bowl broke on the 2nd use. A safety issue is that it will run even if the top is not locked on both sides. Minimal speed controls. Mostly just top speed. The blender does work ok...and the processor does work..it just seems like it's a real chore to put the thing together when you need to use either of the functions. Sorry I bought this..."
1,Don't buy,"I received this blender as a wedding gift. After taking it out of the box and ruining any chance of returning it we found that none of the attachments would fit onto the base. We decided to at least try it to see if it was supposed to be that way and it was loud, made the room smell like burned rubber, and the base leaked. Although this is the first blender i have owned, I think it is stupid to have a product be so flawed, i will never buy any other Cuisinart product."
1,stay away.,"blender will leave chunks of bananas when making smoothies. processor will throw food out from under the lid and from the shaft where the blade is. very noisy, hard to take processor apart to clean. cuisinart have not lived up to their reputation with this one."
1,"Cheap construction, bad design- DON""T BUY!","We got this for our wedding - it didn't take much use to figure out why its such a piece of crap.1) The food processor is made of cheap plastic and the locking mechanism breaks easily - for us, it broke in the first six months, and once that mechanism is broken, you have to hold the processor lid down in order to get it to start. Bad design of the locking mechanism and cheap material.2) The blender blade got locked - who knows how or why - I swear we haven't misused it, all I did was try to make a smoothie. Its now basically impossible to turn the blades of the blender. I've tried taking it apart, but without a work bench its really not possible, since you need some kind of a clamp to hold down the piece that engages the motor while turning the nut that holds the blades in the opposite direction.Shame on you cuisine art. Don't buy this! I'm never buying a cuisinart product again."
1,Piece of cr@p,We got this as a wedding present and have rarely used it. The reason why because it was always louder than a effing lawnmower. To top it off it just broke last night after trying to puree (very soft) baked sweet potatoes for my daughter's baby food. How could soft food break a Cuisinart product you ask? Well it did simply put and left me high and dry with a whole blender of cut up potatoes that I ended up mashing by hand...Wonderful!!! I HATE this blender combo with a capital H and I will never buy Cuisinart product again. Do not waste your money.
1,High Rent Name-Low Rent Product,"After a year of occasional use, this blender burnt out while blending something soft, filling the kitchen with awful fumes. Fortunately, it was still under warranty; so $16 postal and handling fees and 3 weeks later, I received what I believe is a new replacement. I'm still dubious about this blender. After all, My last blender (a Hamilton Beach) lasted 20 years and was still working when I sold it on Craigslist."
3,Nice except for plastic base.,Decent unit except for the fact the base is made of chrome plated plastic.
1,Buyer be ware!,I hate this equipment. It is the worst (fill in the blank)! Poring liquid out of the mixer without making a huge mess is impossible! Only buy it if you are willing to clean up a huge mess every time you use it! Good Luck!
1,Cheap but Poor Quality,"I bought this item, thinking, like others, that the Cuisineart name meant quality. The blender broke about within about 6 months, but I kept on using the food processor. Light use, I might add. Just a few days ago, the food processor broke -- the plastic food bin snapped. This has been one of the most disappointing purchases I've made. Plus, it is unbelievably LOUD. I'm in the market for a more expensive, sturdy, reliable processor. You get what you pay for."
1,Useless Junk,"The food processor container is too small for 85% of my prep needs. It's just large enough to shred a couple of carrots or a quarter of a very small cabbage at a time. It's too small to make even one pie crust at a time, never mind two.The blender is over sized but it's also pathetically inefficient. How hard can it be to make a smoothie with frozen fruit, for Pete's sake? As noted elsewhere, it's very loud and smells like burning electrical elements every time I've used it for the past year.I bought this in order to save on storage space by combining two appliances in one. As it turns out I got three-fourths of a gadget in one. Hopefully it will wear out soon (a pretty good bet) so I can replace it with two real appliances. Cuisinart usually makes quality products so this dog was quite a disappointment."
2,Too Depressing,"After listening to this album, I felt like I was ""underneath"". As in the ground... A friend led me to ""East Asheville Hardware"" last year and I loved it because it used so much clever humor to gently poke fun at the human condition. I was expecting that same style and instead got some pretty heavy handed stuff. I have tried repeated listenings, but it's not growing on me. I'm a bit afraid to try another album now, and indeed am not so sure I've found a new Harry Chapin after all."
3,"Good information, sloppy organization","The information in the book is excellent. However, it's scattered around and difficult to sort out into an easy-to-follow plan. It's almost like a bunch of newspaper articles thrown together under general topic headings. That said, the information is really quite good, although eating the food in the plan is difficult without a cookbook to match it. I think everyone can agree that if you eat massive amounts of beef, chicken, eggs, veggies, fruits etc... then you can get big, but I don't know many guys (myself included) that can prepare these things to make them edible 365 days a year. Lifting is easy, following diet guidelines is harder, and preparing 3,000 calories worth of ""clean"" food that is edible is the hardest part by far, and that's where this book fell short for me.For information: 4/5 stars.For organization: 2/5 stars. (Fire the editor)"
5,A taste of reality for the skinny guy!!,"I am a college kid 5'9"" and weighing around 150 lbs. unfortunately being a college kid in an engineering programming means I have very little time or money. But I've read most of the book and the things in there just make sense! No one has gotten the guts to tell skinny guys how it is until now. Frankly I plan to apply all the things in the book that I can, but just from what I've read I know that these guys aren't fooling around. They know their stuff."
5,Very special Chopin,"As kids, my brother and I would chase through the corridors of our parents' house thoroughly disrupting the afternoon peace. Even amidst the commotion, as we'd race by our sister's room, we'd catch earfuls of beautiful music playing on her record player, music we later learned were the Polonaises played by Witold Malcuzynski.We've since heard countless versions of the Polonaises. Some have been exceptionally good, like the Duchable, but to our minds none have ever equalled the poise, drama and Polish complexion of the Malcuzynski recording.Years later, I found a CD transfer of the LP on Polskie Nagrania and grabbed it immediately; there was just the one or I would have bought two or three! I hope Nagrania or Angel will issue the disc again so that younger listeners can discover the great artist for themselves."
5,Fantastic!,"What a great compilation of this series! But, like it has been said...it leaves you wanting more. I was born in 1967, but somehow missed this series.....Freddie Prinze certainly is a hottie!....and with a sweet disposition...nothing hard core or edgey....just like George Lopez....someone who doesn't get insulted, but uses humor to point out ignorance...and is proud to have been born here in America! Love this show....would love to see a boxed set come out!!"
5,An excellent read!!!,"Not that C.H.Spurgeon needs my endorsement, but if you haven't read this you've missed a good one."
5,Amazon comes through again.,"This book, ""The Five Languages Of Love"", should be read by folks, not just to abort mistakes that you do, but as a review/reminder even for happily married couples."
5,A great way to get to know your child - and yourself,I highly recommend this book. It really helped me to connect with my son when he was younger. I am reading it again now that my littlest one is almost 5.Buy this book - you won't be sorry!
4,Get to know your kids,"I bought this for my children, who love it. It's helped them better understand each of their children's unique needs. Wish I'd had it when my kids were kids!"
4,Have Higher Expectations For John D,"I'm a huge fan of JDM's work. I recently re-read this book after many years and it is still a good read. I described it to someone as ""a good book if it had been written by anyone else but not quite what one expects from JDM"". Additionally my own perspective is probably much different thanwhen I read it long ago. The narrative switches during the novel with much of it being the death house diary of the character I like to refer to as ""the evil Holden Caulfield"". I couldn't help expecting something more out of it. All of this sounds more negative than I really mean it because it is, after all a very good book."
1,Not a Travis McGee series member,"By the author of the Travis McGee Series, whom I by and large like, but not one of the rainbow!"
2,Too Heavy,I guess it may not be fair for me to evaluate since I ended up returning this item. The reason is it was just too heavy. It's 10 pounds in weight WITHOUT anything in it. I bought it as a wheeled BACKPACK. I don't want to carry that much weight ... can you imagine how heavy it would be after packing?
3,Mixed up finish,"The mixer seems to be nice, however, I expected a brushed chrome metal finish. Needless to say, it came thru as a SATIN SILVER PLASTIC. An extreme disappointment in the finish department. My last mixer was purchased at W.T. Grant Co. so you can guess how many years I've had that mixer. I was hoping this one would be a nice metal finish and last at least as long as my old mixer. Very misleading advertising. They could at least have written ""FAUX brushed chrome""."
3,great product while it lasts,"This has been a great mixer for nearly 3 years. Now it has developed the same problem others have described = the beaters don't turn smoothly, rendering it impossible to use. I replaced the beaters thinking one may have been bent. But they simply stick and won't turn whether in individually or together. I was thinking about replacing it with the same model, hoping this was a fluke. But seeing that other people have had the same experience, I'll find something else. Very disappointing."
5,option 2 vids rock the beats wicked respeck.,"These compilations are amazing, the group searches the numerous prefectures of Japan looking for the best drifters, only to make a team from the results, and having fun doing it. Just another great video from Option2"
1,Dull and Banal,"This work is actually a collection of short stories under the guise of a novel. Each story is connected to each other by clumsily written literary threads, providing cover for the fact that the author hasn't the imagination or the creativity to expand each story into a full-length book. I was looking forward to reading about vampires and werewolves, but they only appeared briefly in the stories, I found that immensely disappointing. More than that, I found that the actions and motivations of the characters to be inconsistent and unrealistic. The author failed to make me care about what happened to them.It was a poorly written book, overall. And dull. I can see why this book is out of print."
3,a disappointng book,This was a disappointing book in many ways. First it's not exactly a novel. Instead it's a series of episodes involving the same set of characters. You get the impression this started out as a sequence of short stories. Second the transitions between the episodes is repetitious and awkward. One of the major characters does a badly handled flip flop between the first and second episodes for instance. There are the bones of an interesting story here if the author had just taken the step of rewriting the episodes especially the first two to make the storyline consistant and remove the glitches.
1,Disappointed>>>>>>>>>>>>,"I thought I was getting the next smaller size than the regular Etch a Sketch...I just bought 2 of the 4 x 6"" ones cheaper than these and had no shipping at WalMart. These were not described very well. Would have never ordered them.."
5,Great insight into the life of a groundbreaking man,This book provides marvelous insight into what formed the path of Conrad Baar's life. I have a profound respect for this man. This book is an eye-opening firsthand look at the tragedy of Nazism which left me with a greater respect for life and mankind.
1,Out of date edition,"This is an out of date edition. Look for 1898660875 instead.This book, while still useful, is copyright 1994 or 1995 and pre-dates the last round of (major) sailing rule changes."
3,Good enough deal,"The book was in fine shape. Wished I could have gotten it sooner, but I did receive it in a week. I saved half the book price new."
4,Snap tool,"Tool works very well both top and bottom of snaps. Great addition to my tool bag. Helped a boating buddy with several frozen snaps in a very hard to get at location that he could not get off, worked like a champ."
2,Rickey Smiley,Two stars because it wasn't worth me buying. Renting it on redbox for a dollar is a better choice. There were few funny parts but it isn't Rickey Smiley's best preformance
1,LOST in transit,"Sorry to inform you guys that I have yet to receive this DVD (Today is Sunday Jan.15,2012). Patiently awaiting it's arrival. Thought it may have gotten LOST in the Christmas shuffle?? please get this to me ASAP Thanks"
2,Did not meet expectations,"I like Rickey Smiley, so my expectations for ""Open Casket Sharp"" were high especially after watching the clips on the commercial. Turns out the only funny parts of the entire show were on the commercial clips and Steve Harvey who introduced Rickey at the beginning of the show. Very disappointing."
5,Love this man!,I love Rickey Smiley...he is just the craziest comedian ever! He keeps me in tears...I laugh so hard it's a shame. I saw this on BET but can't wait for my DVD to arrive so I can laugh until my stomach hurts.
2,'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT FUNNY1111,"At one point in the show Ricky Smiley asks people on the front row why they aren't laughing. The answer is simple. this is not funny. I waited and waited for laughs. None came. Maybe I've seen too many comedy shows, but this one does not move me at all. Lil Darryl is more tragic than humorous. The 'Church Lady' brought a few chuckles the first few times he brought her out. The bit about the bass player needed to be fleshed out. But, the music he used had no prominent bass playing in it, so it didn't work. Sorry Ricky Smiley, but you need to put some thought behind your act. Build on something instead of giving us just a premise. I'm still waiting to laugh."
3,"This was a good resource, but needs some work.","This book was a good overview of what will be required on the exam. I took the expert level and passed the first time. But, I did find the sections about macros frustrating, because of errors in the documentation. If needing accurate information on macros, you might want to use a different resource. Otherwise, the general instruction in this book will help with the exam."
2,Watch out for typos and misdirections,"This book got me through the exam but only because I was fortunate enough to sidestep the authors' numerous errors, whether typos, incorrect instructions or omissions. Read the book, take the test, and then get rid of the book--don't hang onto it for reference."
5,This really does work to keep your pet cool!,"This is the second canine cooler bed I've purchased. My first dog never liked the first bed I purchased, so I gave it to a friend's dog who loved it! Actually, he loved it too much and ended up rupturing it. These beds are made of heavy duty vinyl, but I can't recommend them for bigger breeds who like to dig at their bedding.Anyway... Before I gave the first bed away, I used to lay on it on the floor after doing yard work in hot weather; and I can honestly say this item works. There is a definite cooling sensation, not to mention the cushy feel of the sponge mattress and water contained within. Now that I have a new dog, I decided to get her one; and she loves this bed! If you get the small size, you can use a standard pillow case as a cover. It's a perfect fit and a lot less expensive than the official covers that are for sale."
5,A race we are losing,"Our society is dying. The values which made Europe and America the greatest-ever civilisations are being destroyed, and now our land itself is being invaded. Will we ever be able to summon up the fight to do something about it? I am beginning to doubt it, but books like this fill me with hope.If you are white it is your duty to buy this book."
3,"An interesting, but ultimately not very satisfying, series.","An interesting, but ultimately not very satisfying, series. Aldiss seems to have conceived the series as a chance to say some things about religion, and to make up an entire other planetary system with unusual weather effects and evolutionary adaptations. He didn't seem to realize until the second book that he also needed characterization and an interesting plot, and then he doesn't do a great job. There are some insightful or suspenseful or beautiful parts, but there is a lot of senseless rape and violence, not for shock value (the few sex scenes are more boring than anything else), but seemingly as part of his philosophy about the nature of mankind. Towards the end he throws in some stuff about the dangers of technology that seems completely out of place. Read it if you have nothing else to do, but keep a dictionary nearby for when he throws in seriously obscure words, and don't expect to be able to pronounce many of the names."
1,this book made me cry,I had originally bought this with two other books.The other two being Meg and The Trench.I read this book first and it was just a disgrace to the shark itself.Besides switching scenes every other sentence the author treated the shark as nothing but a soulless beast. i read up to the last five pages and couldnt bring myself to even finish the book because it was so bad. Stick with Steve Alten
2,suspension of disbeleif can only go so far,"i would have much rather given this novel 2 and a half stars, as it's not really bad enough for 2, but not good enough for three. i finished it (incidentally rather quickly), so that's a testament. a lot of wilson's ideas are just a little too far out there, and just don't mesh. the vocally communication between the sharks is dare-say rediculous, but that's the only BAD idea he had. he seems to be combining too many stories at once, which detracts from the over-all story. i recommend reading it, but have far from high expectations.--paul death"
2,"Ridiculously implausible, a mass-market jest.","The premise for "" Extinct "" is tired and over played. How many more novels concerning killer sharks need we have? The book is well researched, the authou obviously having taken great pains to learn about his subject, the prehistoric chacarodon megalodon, ancestor of the great white shark. Then he mixes in the factual aspects of the fish with the rest of the book in such a way one gets the feeling the scenes were written after the rest of the book and added later. Any ties to the megalodon as it was are brutally severed in a premise so hackneyed one wonders why the author bothered to ground it in reality. A potentially good tale is flushed away in uninteresting charachterizations and murky action sequences. In addition, this novel was a miserable choice for an NBC special, which the cover advertises"
2,Returned it,"The hippie-dippy drawings, right out of Whole Earth catalog or Moosewoods Cookbook, didn't really work for me. I wanted photographs and careful precise accounts of these tools. Perhaps it is too old for that. Someone should redo this."
3,It wont fit 'ALL' !,"I am sure this is adequate for some, but if you have a few extra lbs to cover, its too small."
5,Great for beginners,"As a beginner in the Arabic language I found this book/tape to be very helpful with pronunciation. The transliterations are consistent and useful. It's great to have a dictionary and phrase book all in one small easy-to-carry volume. I would expect that travelers would find the dictionary particulary useful, as it includes an Arabic to English section organized by transliteration (not Arabic script). Since this is intended for travelers it contains only minimal grammatical information, but the grammatical notes are useful, and are enough for beginners and travelers. This is Egyptian Arabic, but contains an interesting section on the various Arabic dialects which would prove quite useful to anyone traveling to various Arabic-speaking countries."
3,Asunder,Good story line but too much time spent describing sexual activity!Cuts out possible readership. I want to get rid of my copy.
5,Comedy to make you think!,"Troy Conrad is a bright and witty comedian. Whether you're an Atheist or Christian, Troy will give you something to laugh about as well as ponder. Don't pass up ""The Comedy Jesus Show"". If you can't attend a live performance, then consider ordering this DVD. I will probably also purchase any other DVDs featuring Troy."
4,"Great series, Great episodes","One of the great sixties TV comedy series. The selections in this compilation set are all great individual episodes too. Includes the Paul Lind as the visiting Mountie episode (remember the bandit from Banff-fff-ff?) The surprising thing is how long it's taken for the complete First Season disks to be issued. They are due out (according to Amazon) in June 2006. In the meantime, this compilation fills the gap."
2,what happen to the cover,Dont get me wrong got the dvd but a clear casing whats up with that !!!? I didnt get the cover you see now but a clear casing of the dvd. Dvd worked find thank God but you the purchase a dvd like f troop you would like to the box to see the the pics and remember back when!!! you know what I mean.
4,Compact & Easy,"Compact and easy to use. Fits snug in USB port. A little too snug as it is hard to pull out. Easy to insert the MicroSD card. Every computer I've used it on (Win 98, XP, Vista, Linux) found it and was able to use it.Overall very pleased. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the first one I got stopped working after 2 uses. 5 stars to the seller (Blue Proton) for quick replacement. And it only took 1 email and 3 days to get it. Nice!"
2,damaged package,One spray bottle was empty because it had leaked into the cardboard container. I did not realize that there was a choice of fragrance. I preferred the rosemary that I had the last time. Any chance of getting a replacement bottle?
1,Does nothing.,"I've tried this product on all kinds of cleaning tasks. Forget harsher cleaning products - it doesn't even hold its own against dish soap and water in a spray bottle. It cleans slightly better than water by itself, but only just. I genuinely don't know what the positive reviews here are talking about."
5,Awesome compilation of Thurber's writings,"I think the book is beautiful and very well done.Thurber was a great writer and his works are worth reading.I have a bit of personal interest in this, though since he wasmy father's 2nd cousin. Looking at Thurber's photo in the bookis like looking at my brother's face when he was a young man."
5,Great Graphic Novel,"(...)Alpha Shade is one of the best new graphic novels I have seen in a long time. The product is solid. (the reviewer that reported pages falling out was either reading a different comic or recieved a defective copy because this is a solid book) The art is beautiful and is very effective at getting across what it wants. Overall the book was put together really well.Now on to the story, Alpha Shade chapter one starts the story ""in media res"". (or in the middle of the action for those that don't speak latin) The entire thing is a battle that is used to introduce the world of Alpha Shade and at least one of the main characters. (Laura) The next few chapters are going to be the story of how Laura and her friends get from Earth to the world of Alpha Shade. (sort of a ""through the looking glass"" thing I guess) Overall I am very excited to see where the story will go and I think that the Brudlos brothers really know what they are doing. I highly recomend picking it up."
2,Return To Glory: Smoke and Mirrors,This book is pure fiction by a former player of Tyrone Willingham's at Stanford. Grant falls way short in is half hearted attempt to understand anything about a winning football tradtion at a school that identifies its very existence around football. He is a hater and now is spewing lies about how Notre Dame is irrelvant on ESPN.com because his book is no longer selling. More like his book is irrelvant. This man has no integrity as a journalist.
4,Wrong item shipped; still happy!,"I ordered the pecan cinnamon crunch yet received a ""plain"" version of the nuts. I was about to call & send the order back when my husband opened one of the packs. He said that they were great and so I tried a little cluster and I totally agree, they are really great nuts. We kept the wrong order and I have even shared a pouch with family members and friends, all of who love the product. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because in the end, the order was sent wrong."
2,Unbalanced,"The book claims to present a system's view on wireless communications. In distortion of history, the book champions IS-95, which - while having excellent radio modems - did not really succeed as a system. The bias toward products of some companies jeopardizes the scientific banlance of the book.The MIMO part is not bad, but there are other good books around on that specific topic."
2,"a Rock, junior?","Ok, having read the other reviews about this movie,- scorpion king 2, i can concur, - the acting was bad, the story could have been better, - true true -- BUT, i was happy to see that the little baldheaded mathyias had the mannerisms of the older mathyias down pat, - down to the eyebrow lift - i enjoyed alot of that. - i watched the whole movie. - i cringed some, i laughed some at some stupidness, - but i watched it, and will give it to my grandkids --"
1,Another Bad Sequel/Prequel,"Sometimes one can laugh at products like this--not this time around.Bad acting, bad storline, bad movie."
3,"OK, not great","This movie was entertaining, but not as good as the origonal. It had less action and seemed corny at times. Also, the special effects seemed fairly low budget."
1,Ouch!!!!!!!!!,"Unquestionably battling for the top spot in the category of the 5 worst movies I've seen in the past 40 years, it's PATHETIC, Randy is worse than a doped up porn actor, it's disgusting, how can they sell this???If you watch it or buy it you are an idiot, you've been warned!!!!"
2,Crapped out in one year,"I bought this cable a year and 1 month ago. It has stopped functioning properly, and drops the signals. I have it connected to my wacom tablet and it stops working. I took out my backup cable and the tablet worked fine. These things crap out fast. Not built to last even a little while."
5,Higher quality/more rugged than I was expecting,"I was expecting a really standard, thin extension, but this is beefier and solid looking, quality looks very good, hopefully that's an indication that it'll last."
4,Bacon Wave - Very Handy!,I like this product. It works well and is easy to use. Somewhat hard to clean but wash it or soak it immediately after using and everything comes right off. Don't pay over $12.99 for this though. Search around and you'll find better prices.
2,Absolutely horrible mixes ruin otherwise great compilation,"While the Myrmidons of Melodrama has probably the definitive Shangri-Las greatest hits tracklisting, the stereo mixes of the group's biggest singles are absolutely horrible. Songs like ""Leader of the Pack"" and ""Give Him a Great Big Kiss"" were never intended to be heard in stereo when they were recorded, and the manufacturers of this disc took absolutely no care in remixing the original mono recordings of these singles. Both of these songs sound very flat and lifeless compared to the stereo originals. While there are a lot of rare gems to be found on this CD, consider purchasing another with the original mixes before you waste your money on this shoddily-assembled compilation."
4,A fun read!,"This was recommended by someone in one of my bookclubs and I was not disappointed. She recommended this after going to Key West. Being from South Philadelphia, I could identify with the wise-guy lingo. But even if you are not familiar with the Sopranos like talk, you will love this. This was one of those times that I did not know the ending. It is an easy read but still keeps you turning the pages. It's got mystery, comedy, and a little romance-but more in the way of emotions. The development of the characters of Joey, Bert the Shirt with Don Giovanni, Gino and all the supporting characters of the compound are well thought out and add to the enjoyment. I would definitely recommend this book."
4,Hilarious,"This is a thoroughly entertaining novel. The characters are well written and well developed, not to mention downright funny and rather quirky. When you start reading this you'll be able to feel the Flofida sunshine on your neck."
2,If You Don't Have Anything Else to Read . . .,"I was so disappointed in this book. I have read everything by Kimberla Lawson Roby and this work didn't match up to her other books. The story was believable but it didn't have her usual sense of humor and expression that was found in her earlier works. If you just love reading books and you need something to read, go ahead and read it. But I finished this book feeling like she rushed the ending and that there was really no sense of completion."
3,FAST READ,I STARTED AT 6PM AND FINISHED AT 2:30 AM....I HAVE READ ALL KIM'S BOOKS AND THIS WAS PROBABLY MY SECOND BEST..... THE ENDING KIND OF THREW ME OFF GUARD BUT OVER ALL IT WAS A GOOD READ....
2,What a BAD ending!!!,I would have given this book a 4 if it had not been for this god awful ending. Don't waste your time or money.
2,Boring and predictable,While I am a fan of Ms. Roby's - this did not measure up. This book was very boring and had no ending. There was not a worthwhile plot and the characters were not developed. Casting The First Stone needs to be the benchmark.
5,One of the greatest dramas I know,"I can fall into line with the writer of the ""product description"" who did most wonderful. One exeption: instead of refering to a European spirit, Goethe's works at this time are to be related to the 'Klassik' period, strongly based on the resumption of the ancient Greek, Roman and renaissance ideas of humanity.I follow as well the given further recommendations of other plays, stressing esp. - e.g. - Gerhard Hauptmann, and adding, e.g., Friedrich Schiller, ""Intrigue and Love"", and Bertold Brecht, ""The Good Person of Szechwan""!(Pls. don't imply to my comment I'd be focused too much on German drama and literature: I strongly appreciate as well e.g. plays of Tennessee Williams and Edward Albee, just to name some American writers.)"
5,An excellent treatment of the doctrine of eternal security,"Dr. Shank gives an erudite, compelling (and in my opinion, correct) treatment of the doctrine of eternal security, which is so tightly bound up in the tenets of strict reformed theology. The beauty of the book is that he relies so heavily on scripture to back his points up. In a nutshell, he rejects the doctrine; if you want to know why, you need to read it (or at least see what he does with the scriptures traditionally used to support the notion). If not, please be intellectually honest and don't assert that you know why his conclusion is wrong, having never heard his argument. Highly recommended, for proponents of the doctrine, and opponents as well."
1,WRV200,This product stinks. I bought it because it had SNMP capability and I wanted to do some network monitoring with it. It constantly disconnects from my DSL service. I had a Linksys WRT54G that never had a problem. I do not recommend this product.
1,Don't Purchase,We are a samll shop with 8 employees. I purchased the Linksys to provide both wirless and router use. This router is worthless...I truly would never tell anyone to purchase this. We had had nothing but problems. The router locks up and the VPN doesn't work.
5,excellent; just like shown,"I use a vitamin splitter to break tablets in 1/2 for my Westie's. Maggie was diagnosed with a 'problems with her pancreas' and I thought, she just needs Vitamin B, so 2 weeks later, next test was normal. Most of our foods strip away B vitamins; vitally important. Also NOW is one of the brands Whole Foods sells, that's why I chose it."
1,Not what I expected,"These things are HUGE!!! X-small???? Not even close!!! When I looked up returning them the company won't reimburse you for shipping, so it would actually cost more to try and return them! I'm going to donate these and look for something else. So disappointing!!"
3,Not a great book,"Although there are parts of all of Sandy's life in the book, it seemed to revolve too much around the 1965 World Series. I'm still waiting for a good biography on Sandy."
1,Doesn't do justice to the man,"Koufax was the greatest, he deserves a better book. I suspect that some of the more positive reviews posted are more a reflection of the reviewers' feelings about Koufax, rather than the book. This book is poorly written and incredibly boring. How any writer could make the subject of Sandy's brilliant career boring is beyond me. But Gruver finds a way. The writing is dry and disorganized, there is little flow to the material, too many meaningless quotes from others are included without sufficent editing, and a plethora of unimportant details not only overwhelm the narative but are frequently repeated, sometimes three or four times. I've just ordered Jane Leavy's book, it's got to be better."
1,Music Different than stated,This was a total disappointment and had to be returned.First the music on this CD--was not the music listed .Very poor sound on the CD.Stay away from this garbage !!
1,Leaky Chillow,I was really happy to receive this as a Christmas gift but the cap does not seal well and the chillow leaks...slowly...but who wants a wet bed?
1,So not worth the $$$$$$$$$$,This thing is not a pillow. It just holds like 5 cups of water and is a flat insert that is heavy and does not stay in the pillow case. You have to lay flat and cannot move on it in order to get the benefits. This is the dumbest thing I have ever bought. Don't waste your money!
3,Chillow Pillow Result,I will say the product has helped me greatly now waking up no more than twice as oppose to every 1-2 hours nightly. The negative is that the pillow cools down which is when I wake up during the night. It's still an awesome product when you are experiencing the life change associated with night sweats.
4,"Finally, A Decent Robotech Game","I'm not sure about the other reviews for this game, but I found it pretty satisfying. It's a 1st/3rd person (switchable) shooter set in the world of Robotech. An admirable attempt has been made at creating a ""you are not fighting alone"" feel ala ""Call Of Duty"". Very nice in-engine cut-scenes further the story as you progress throughout the game. The fighting can get pretty intense and confusing at times, and the color palette doesn't always lend itself to easily seeing all the action, but this is still a solid game that should satisfy Robotech fans and action fans alike."
2,One of the wrost WWE pay-per-views ever.,I only bought this on DVD because I actually went to the event and I try to buy all of the PPV's I go to on DVD. I would not recommend anyone else buying it however because it is easily the most disappointing wrestling event I have ever been to.
1,ECW,"I watched this ppv live in the UK & i was so dissapointed. ECW is dead. If Paul Heyman got the chance, he would of got this ppv as he wanted too but VKM had other plans. Only got too words for this. THIS SUCK'SIf you want to watch some proper ECW, Go n get the original. That Rules !!"
1,Total Junk - Not worth 5 cents!,"I don't know how to begin describing what a total waste of time and money this product is. First, the games require that you set your display to 256 colors. This is 1989 technology and it shows. The dictionary has at most maybe 100 words in it and it's just a plain ASCII text list that pops up, not even a real dictionary. The pronunciation guide is a dirt simple text paragraph about long and short vowel sounds, it has nothing to do with how to pronounce any single word.This program is total trash. I'd be embarrassed to give it away. Either the producers at Simon & Schuster never even looked at this product or they don't care how they get your money. I'm astonished that any responsible manager would let something this awful onto the market bearing the company name. I'll sure never buy anything released by Simon & Schuster after this."
1,Piece of GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!,"My husband had a stroke and needed this to bathe. It came and when we tried to put the legs on, they all went easily except one, where the button would not push in for us to slide the leg on, no matter how hard we tried. Called Amazon, whose basic response was ""So sorry, comes from another seller, nothing we can do. We'll give you a refund when we get it back."" This is increasingly Amazon's policy. Nothing they can do, all the fault of the seller. In the meantime, I'm stuck with a defective product and no way to give my husband a shower unless I want to pay for another chair and get my refund later. What lousy customer service. Amazon should take their cue from Zappo's - the best online customer service on the planet. I'm a longtime customer of Amazon who has spent TONS of money on this site, but no more. They've lost my business, and weren't even interested in doing anything to keep it.Good riddance to Amazon."
5,Medlone shouwer/tub transfer bench,"Purchased before my husband came home after sustaining stroke. Transfer bench was recommended by occupational therapist. Allows my husband to shower with minimal assistance,and increases the safety getting in and out of the tub. Sturdy, easy to put together and stable."
4,good for the price,"my daughters 219 lbs, works for her, and seems stable, price was good compared to most places i went and viewed. have had this one before, but cost me alot more lasted over 5 years. can't beat that"
4,Thought provoking 70s scenario that is still relevant,"Paul Erdman belives that most foreign countries look out for themselves and that America, our own country, should and must do the same. That is the overarching theme of this 70s political thriller. America is in dire financial straits, with a falling dollar and stagnant economy. A major US aerospace company, buffeted by these trends, finds that it can save itself at the cost of selling out America. Foreign powers maneuver to take advantage of the faltering United States. This novel, while containing details that are anachronistic today, nevertheless has an eerie relevance as we watch the dollar plunge, gold skyrocket, and America become uncertain of itself in the 2011 time frame. Highly recommended. RJB."
5,Great Resource,"Excellent collection of information about failed quality assurance programs and human performance errors. Disasters discussed cover a wide range industries from construction to space exploration. If you are researching what causes disasters, this is the book."
3,interesting but haphazard,"This is a very interesting and quick read. It starts out terrific with a riveting telling of the collapse of the WTC towers, a north sea oil rig, and 3 mile island. But somewhere halfway into the book it starts to get muddled. The stories mix and match and some paragraphs don't make sense no matter how many times you read them. He also begins lecturing on systems failure as much as (or more than) telling stories. This guy knows how to explain things, but I get the feeling the 2nd half of the book was rushed to completion and/or an editor went insane. A strong point is in lots of good examples of near-misses and times when things went right in bad circumstances.Lots of good stories and lessons here but structured poorly so some parts you have to fight through."
3,Didn't work for me,The 'handle' on this hook wasn't quite big enough for me. I guess my arthritis is just too bad. I really hoped!
5,Love this Keyboard Platform,I have had this exact keyboard tray on my home computer desk for several years. When I needed a keyboard tray added to a new desk at work I was pleased to find this one. It's the best and the price is very good. Thank you.
5,This is the best!,I replaced my old one which is identical and they are still making them! Am so glad cuz it tucks away nicely when not in use and slides very nicely to the angle that is just right for your body size. Very sturdy and well made!
4,Big Help,"I am in the waiting stage for the delivery of my second unit. Most likely the reason I had to get the second one is that the shelf has been positioned so that the shelf actually rests on my knees unless I stick my feet straight out in front of me. Resting on my knees has no doubt led to some unnecessary upward pushing and at times that pushing has been first one side and then the other. Even though I broke the one I am still using, I was able to get it back into shape enough to use until the new unit arrives. The 30 some percent discount on the price of the new one probably had something to do with me ordering it on New Year's Eve."
5,A Fantastic Movie!,"I loved this movie. I rented it from a video store, and watched it three times the same weekend! Calista Flockhart's part is perfect, and the other actors are very well chosen. It's is a beautiful love story, and I loved the Shakespearean english. If you listen closely, you'll find all the humorous bits that have been thrown in. All in all, this was extremely enjoyable and addictive."
1,"Horrible advice, unrealistic expectations","This book is good for someone who grows their own organic vegetables in their backyard, has an endles supply of dry milk powder on hand, and treats white sugar as a poison. We all want to eat well when we are pregnant to ensure a healthy mother and baby, but this book sets impossible standards for the average woman to follow. Anyone who shops at a normal grocery store will find this book's guidelines hard to follow. Common sense, and an increased awareness of nutrition are enough to give you the knowledge you need to have a healthy baby. Do not buy this book unless you want to start feeling guilty and ashamed and exhausted from trying to follow the diet."
2,What's With The Tone?,"I do not understand why this series is so popular - is it the good title or just that they have been around some time? My wife and I went out and got an arm full of books and this was one of them. The positive side is that it did seam to provide some good recommendations for what to eat and what to avoid. It also gave us a good idea on the special health and nutrition issues for pregnant women. What we did not like is it seams that this book should have come with an overbearing adult wagging her finger at you. I don't think we needed or cared for the tone the book had about the authors militant views on what not to eat - is 1 coke really going to be that bad? 50 years ago women worked in the fields or factories all day, smoked and drank like fish and we all turned out ok. Overall a nice overview with some good recipes, but if you are aggravated by being talked down to then I would look someplace else."
1,This book goes in the yard sale box,I'm all for healthy eating but the recipes in this book are horrible and the guidelines are impossible. I made one of the desserts and no one would eat it! Pregnancy is not a time for starvation.
2,Do you live in the real world?,"I am a physician and while eating healthy is a very important aspect of your pregnancy, these women will make you crazy trying to follow their very strict diet. Come on, no sweets! I hope anyone who reads this book will use their common sense and take the writers' recommendations with a grain of salt. Pregnancy is not a time to put yourself on a strict diet. Eat healthy and enjoy your pregnancy."
1,What about morning sickness?,"A friend sent me this book as she knew that I was suffering from 24 hour 'morning' sickness. After reading a few pages, I felt even worse! Instead of reassuring me, it made me feel that I was somehow failing because I could not simply deal with my sickness and eat the totally impractical Best-Odds diet. The tone is often patronising - for example, suggesting that I am ignorant or irresponsible if I order a tuna sandwich on white bread. It's maybe worth reading this book for the few practical ideas that it gives. However, after feeling guilty for several days for having eaten white bread - not wholewheat - for the first trimester (one of the few things that I could eat at all), I put the book away and decided to use common sense instead."
1,you gotta be joking,"I read this book in conjunction with it's companion, What to Expect When Your Expecting, it was just plain silly. To begin with the recipes were not good. My dog wouldn't eat the things they had me make, and unless you grow your own wheat, and raise your own livestock, this book would have you believe your baby will be born with health problems and you will gain 500lbs. Please. A little common sense goes a long way. DO NOT read this book if this is your first baby or if it's your 10th. Rely on your Dr. or midwife."
1,This is no the VCLMHG07A. Please see the pictues: This is a (VCLMHG07),ATTENTION!!! THIS IS NOT THE VCLMHG07A! THIS IS VCLMHG07. DO NOT PURCHASE IT!!! They sent me the wrong one and they haven't retourn my call either. I contacted AMAZON and they said they will help me to contact the seller!
4,A Fine Introduction to Critical Musical Understanding,"This book was recommended to my music theory class and I happened to check it out and so far I find it to contain very wise and important statements about music and the way we listen to it. I would also recommended the book ""The Joy of Music"" by Leonard Bernstein, it is another book by a great musician that elucidates music."
3,What to Listen for in Music,"Aaron Copland is a great composer, but his ability to write a book about music is not as great as his composing skills. This book is more useful to musicians than to the common reader. As a musican, this was a very useful book. I enjoyed reading it."
5,Great Little pump,This pump moves a lot of water for it's compact size. Little Giant makes very tough reliable pumps. I would recommend them to anyone.
1,Cheap Price = Cheap Products,"In the past three years, I have owned five of these pumps.I bought them because there were inexpensive.Well the old lesson holds true in this case:""You get what you pay for.""Two pumps have given up the ghost and, tonight,my third Little Giant pump has turned into an oily mess.So evidently, the seals are shot.It would not be so bad if i used these pumps a lot but, i don't.I turn them on for ten minutes spurts, once every week or two.I also have two Flotec pumps that I've owned for three yearsI use them everyday and I've never had a problem with either of them.No more Little Giants for me!"
1,They don't make them like they used to...,"I owned one of these for 15 years. The one I owned was made in the USA. The new one I just got is made in Mexico. The moment I put this into the water, small bubbles from the seam on the blue casing began escaping in a small stream to the surface. I didn't think this was a big deal but when I looked closer, it was actually leaking small droplets of the oil from inside the pump to the water surface. The pump got way hotter than my current 5MSP that I own. Just disappointing."
1,Do not buy this item.,"The first unit I had lasted 10 years. The second one lasted about a week. The third unit lasted 2 months. Finally, I decided enough with this product and changed to a different pump maker. I learned Little Giant moved production to Mexico and now turn out what I consider junk!!!"
5,The Little Giant Water Wizard Pump,I have used the Little Giant Water Wizard Pump in my Home Improvement business for 37 years now. I'm on my second one only because I gave my first one away.. It's a hard working dependable pump..
5,Check it out,"Check this one out. While it's impossible to do a full tour of world music on one CD, this one takes you through several cultural flavors and moods, interpreted by the styles & instrumentation offered by this top-notch group of players.Thank God that Didier is still alive & making such amazing music! And thanks to Amazon for now offering this CD."
2,A Slight Disappointment,"While it was great to play some of these old games, I was very disappointed with the fact that some of the games didn't work. Also, some of them were supposed to be 2 - 4 player games, but only the 1 player version was available. It made for a quite frustrating experience. If the games would work as advertised, it would be great."
4,Great 80's Slasher,"Let me start of by saying that I am a big horror fan but have not really seen a whole lot of 80's slashers. Well, I went to my local video store a few weeks ago and picked this one up. I am so glad I did because after I watched this movie I was so happy with my purchase. The Burning is a awsome movie. Great suspenes, great score, great kills(by the legendary Tom Savni), and has a all around creepy atmosphere. There are a few scenes 1 inperticuarly that made it hard to sleep that night. like I said I have never really been into the slasher genere until now but the burning was so good that I ent out picked up a few other films like The Prowler, Sleepaway Camp, and Silent night deadly night and I love them all. I guess the thing that always held me back from these movies was i thought that they would be like the friday the 13th franchise(I hate those movies) but i am glad i found this movie and I recomened it to anybody who loves horror movies."
3,Killer on berserk!,"THis movie is quite good but not perfect. The story is about some teenagers that fryes their campingleader in an acsident.Some years later some other people camps on the same place, and there, the barbequed camping leader awaits them.If you love splatter then i thingk you shoud buy it, otherwise save the money for something else."
3,"The Burning, A reveiw from a horror buff!!","I would have actually given this video 3 1/2 stars. I was not expecting much from this one (The only reason I got it it was supposed to be similar to Madman) but I was pleasently suprised,Jason Alexander was great in it!!It started a little slow than got going all at once. Not a bad slasher film at all, very gory and decent acting. This film looked like it had a much bigger budget than Madman did but Madman has been rereleased onto DVD, and this is only avaiable here on VHS. One of the neat things about the film was that it mostly took part in the day time. That is not very common for slasher films that usually depend on the cover of darkness to mask their low budgets. I would recommend this to any horror/slasher fan. My final rating 3 1/2 stars."
4,A Cut above the rest,"The Burning is a cut above horror movies that followed in the wake of Halloween and Friday The 13th. ANY horror movie with Tom Savini's name attached was a cut above the rest. His effects in this movie are stellar. (Highly recommended; The Prowler, Maniac, Day of the Dead) Rick Wakeman's score settles into a comfortable cheezy category. The score is NOT Halloween nor Friday The 13th...however, it holds up well. The characters have heart. The story borrows from the Friday the 13th template but the writer(s) added a little spin for creativity. Grab some popcorn and go camping. Watch out for Jas-...uh, I mean Cropsy."
2,teresa's burning,"it was a boring yet funny film,but at the same time the gore was ok. i didn't like the story line or plot."
3,What's all the fuss about ?,"Granted, the idea for ""The Burning"" was conceived before ""Friday the 13th"". In its time, alot of the scenes were considered too graphic so the film was either banned in many countries or severely edited. Having recently seen the new DVD version which is fully uncut, I have to wonder what all the fuss was about for this film. On top of that, it was downright slow to get moving. If this film was released now in 2007 it would not even raise an eyebrow.The film's saving grace is that it is from 1980 and collector's will want it in their collections to compliment other films from that period. Look out for a young Holly Hunter in a few of the scenes.DVD SUMMARY: A nice clean widescreen print and an interesting mini doco on the making of the film. An audio commentary and theatrical trailer complete the special features."
3,I bought this as a gift.,"I bought this as a gift for my uncle as he wanted to replace the vinyl version he owned, but I never actually listened to it. I just don't want Amazon to keep prompting me to review this item, as there is no 'skip' button."
3,"Has some good glam rock songs, but overall just ""ok""","Sweet is best known for ""Ballroom Blitz"" from the Wayne's World soundtrack and lesser known for their single ""Little Willy"". This album pretty much contains two great glam rock songs, ""Ballroom Blitz"" and ""Fox On The Run"", with the rest being either ""ok"" or filler. I'll admit that they do a good job making catchy, yet dumb and pointless, songs like ""The 6-Teens"" and ""No You Don't"", however it's catchy in a Backstreet Boys kind of way (i.e. forgettable). It sounds pretty dated and thus not really recommended.Highlights include:""Ballroom Blitz""""The 6-Teens"" (but barely)""Fox On The Run"""
1,No Cotton,"I bought this bra because the ad says 100% cotton. There is no cotton in this bra. It is 76% nylon and 24% elastane. If you want a cotton bra, this is not for you."
3,"Good, but I need some help!","This game is a great value for the money. My kids and I play together and they don't even fight over who gets a turn first. I was pleasantly surprised.The only problem is that it is impossible to get off the first level of games! I can't figure out how to defeat the rhino and there are no instructions included that advise how to play the game. This has left us frustrated and not able to fully play all the levels of the game.For a kid who is too young to get past the first level, I suppose it is a 5 star game... for everyone else, only 2."
3,Explantions and buggy software a problem,"The book was decent with many practice problems, but the explanations were sometimes too complicated and not structured enough for you to truly understand it. The CD is buggy, occasionally it stop and all the answer are lost, which is a major pain. Also, the answers are not saved, so you cannot go back to the ones you got wrong later on. I do have not used any other books, so i am not sure how it compares."
4,these books are a guilty pleasure.,"I have read all WEB Griffin books and eagerly await each new edition, even though they are virtually all the same. I'm sure the armed forces are a lot more fun when you are rich (what isn't?) Couple of gripes with this one: How does the CIA take islands vital to Inchon without consulting MacArthur, Why would McCoy take the broad with him to those islands, and how does she fall in love with Pick with virtually no interaction? Also, what happened to Pick? Guess we'll have to wait a year or two for Griffin to get around to writing volume ten.This isn't War and Peace, and it isn't even Winds of War, but I enjoy every one of his books, and look forward to the next installment."
5,Greeeeaaaaaat !,"Don't miss reading it and ""Retreat Hell"". You can't miss the continuation of the story along with the excitement."
1,Lousy writing,"I got sick of almost every mention of a character having to include his full rank and service. I got sick of the stupid jargon of the weaponry. The writing is very low quality, and the story is hardly worth telling."
3,Griffin leaves us hanging,"I have been a great fan, but am really disappointed with thisseries. I have waited over a decade to see the completion of theKen McCoy series. Now, several years have been skipped, and theguerrillas in the Phillipines have been left behind. The proofreading has been sloppy as well.John D. Macklin has also been Richard B., Richard D., and John B. In the last book, Griffin says Mccoy isn't Catholic, butremember when he goes to the convent to see his sister?Also in the second book, a marine stands guard with a 1903-A3before they went into production. Small mistakes, but I expecta little better from a talented author such as this.I continue to reread The Corps and Call to Arms, The Lieutenantsand The Captains because they are great stories.Please Mr. Griffin, take us back to WWII, and make up your mind on Macklin's real name. This story needs to be finished."
5,W.E.B. Griffin,"W.E.B. Griffin is one of the top fiction writers using real world historical events. Through his novels, he has provided me hours upon hours of excellent reading on subjects that I find interesting from their continuing story lines across his novels, the character building of the principle players, down to the detailed incidents described in each novel. I especially like his style of including the thought processes that each character has in relation to the scenes being depicted in the mind of the reader, as the novel progresses. ""Under Fire"" was on par with his other novels. I have now read all of his novels and eagerly look forward to his future books. If your looking for well written fictional documented historical entertainment, W.E.B. Griffin is the place to start!"
2,"Decent Story, Terrible Characterization","""Under Fire"" is pretty good read, but Griffin's characterization is awful. All of the main characters are heroes, rich, good looking, very well-connected and married to understanding, low-maintenance hotties. This kind of crap makes me groan (esp. since I just finished reading Stephen King's The Stand and the Dark Tower series.Griffin also resorts to military stereotypes where the line officers are wonderful go-getters and the staff types are lazy regulation loving chair warmers.If I wasn't enjoying the easy-to-read story, I'd be putting this book down."
1,Mostly a dud,"Takes a lot of shaking for a very weak light. I've had super-cheap shake lights that worked better. Has a nice quality feel to it, so maybe I just got a dud? But I did buy another model by the same brand at the same time (the one with the battery) and it was the same way."
3,Overall Okay,"Overall the keyboard tray is fine, but for the price, I would expect a mouse tray that doesn't droop so much, that a cordless mouse falls off. Also the wrist pad for the keyboard and mouse are a self stick sort of product, it would be a lot better if there were something to hold them on."
1,Not 2 Pack Package!,I ordered 2 of these 2 packs of mirrors thinking I would get 4 mirrors. Apparently it is just a 'one-pack' because I only received 2 mirrors.
5,Pleased in Pennsylvania,"I have recently read a copy of ""The Fingerprints of God - Exciting Evidence that God Exists, Jesus is Alive and the Bible Can be Trusted""... it is a well-written, thoroughly researched and logical resource that is equally useful for both Christians and skeptics of Christianity. This book has made a believer out of me, and I know of many others who have also been impressed after reading Mr. Cummings book. I would highly recommend it to all with a hearty two thumbs up. You will not be disappointed."
5,"Tibet, Cry of the Snow Lion",Beautifully presented film although it's a documentry. Everyone who's going to visit China or have interest in China MUST see this film.
3,Typical of a child.,"Zlata's Diary is a poorly written diary. It has no emotional insight only weak observations. It is repetitious. I would recommend Anne Frank. Unlike Zlata's Diary, Frank shares her all her feelings and fears. Zlata reveals no feeling only detailess observations. If you need an easy read this is your book. Frankly, I like a more difficult, insightful read."
5,Back to Bosnia & Serbia,"I bought this book for my Serbian guest who was here on an international exchange. When I'd mentioned that Zlata's Diary had been a best seller in the 90s, she was surprised and said she'd never heard of the book and that it would be banned--offically or otherwise--in Serbia today. I was happy to pass this little classic on to her and glad to have got it so quickly from my Amazon order."
1,A Little Disappointing,"I didn't like the fact that Zlata kept saying the same thing over and over again. All she basically said was ""Oh no the water and electricity is out again. The ending was really boring too because the same thing happened in the end as it did in the beginning. It was a good survival book but not a book that I would recommend to read."
3,This book is a good overview of the war but lacks interest,"Zlata's diary is an inside view of the war in Sarajevo which began in 1991. Her book tells of just about everything she did from piano lessons to seeking shelter in her neighbors basement. It tells of her close encounters with death and how her family struggled through the war. She has an optomistic point of view, but you can tell that she is in fifth grade from her writing style. This book gives good details and keeps your attention but is kind of repetative. She talks a lot about stuff that won't interest you but she also talks a lot about war life and what sacrafices she had to make. It's an interesting way of looking at a war and the people that have to live through it."
3,"Touching story, author questionable?","Zlata's diary was a touching, although questionable account of a horrific time. I recommend this book to others, even though at times it gets repetitive. Some of Zlata's insights are a little too advanced for her tender age which is what makes me question the authenticity. Along with reading the book I feel a person should also look into reports of the book being re-written in a slanted light to shed sympathy on certain sides. Not quite Anne Frank but Zlata indeed suffered a great amount and the innocence of her childhood was certainly affected by the tragic events of the Bosnian civil war."
4,Similar to Anna Frank,Very good read. Thought provoking book. It is well written for a young child. The diary format makes it feel even more raw and sincere.
4,"Flawed package, great artist","It is a treat to hear Sabicas' unaccompanied guitar work, but the packaging is inexplicably careless. It's more than the problem of skipping on the first track, or its repetition. The last FIVE tracks are repetitions of earlier tracks, and the insert gives no information about the songs, their traditions, or the artist, a man with a very interesting story. The insert also only has a sadly patronizing little bit about ""authentic"" music, but nothing on what that this authenticity means or why it is so fascinating."
5,"Deep, a really moving movie","The first time I saw this movie I missed alot of important parts to the movie so when I bought it I got to waitness it all. It's a love story that doesn't end in a happy ending at all, but leaves you with a sort of peace that makes you happy in some strange sort of way. I guess I was happy that she had finally experienced love and finally found someone that was her match."
1,The Pears and the Bees,"I found the moving didn't capture the true essence that the book illustrated in its pages.The DVD left out so many important details that were just so necessary to reach the maximum potential needed to live a fullfilled life. The book had so many details the reader would say ""hey, it's like I'm in the book."" Janie in the movie acted more childish and didn't undergo the transformation that I saw in the book. Two Thumbs Down! HA HA HA!"
3,Thier Eyes Were Watching God,"Movie starts where it ends, reflecting back to how she got to where she was. Has the judgement of other people that keeps you wondering if they are right or wrong in thier thinking. I would consider it a love story, one with hardship along the way. I would watch it again but not one of those movies you can watch over and over."

5,Simply the BEST!,"I recently travelled to Africa and bought this video prior to leaving. Not only is the video completly accurate in its portrayal of the magical Serengeti, but the cinematography is excellent. In addition, children just LOVE it! My 3 year old neice couldn't stop watching it. Disney is nothing compared to this video! I recommend it highly!!"
5,Must have DVD!,"This is one of the DVDs in my collection that gets played over and over again. It is such a wonderful film. If you have a large screen television or better yet, a front projector, this is a must have. It is so beautiful. The narration, the cinematography, the music, the story, the nature are wonderful."
1,Nepotism at its' best,"I watched Lily Allen on Saturday Night Live last night. This stage is awful, one of the worst, but it never fails to separate the truly talented from the talentless hacks.After Allen's performance, I looked her up and wasn't surprised to learn that her parents are stars in their own right and have connections in the business.Allen has about as much stage presence as a lump of jiggling jello. But what of her singing chops? Her vocals are so ordinary she wouldn't even be granted a minute of fame on American Idol's worst auditions reel.Her voice has absolutely no power, no depth, no resonance, and no range. There is NOTHING about this bad-tempered, poorly-reared, wannabe pop star worth listening to. Her lyrics are garbage.She is a perfect example of why the music business is in so much trouble. Giving the children of famous people contracts in the hopes they can measure up to mom and dad or worse yet, giving children of famous people contracts who's parents weren't even singers."
1,Don't Get It!,I'm always looking for fresh and unique non top 40 artists but I don't see what is the deal with her. She has an ok voice but not my thing.
5,Guilty Pleasure!,"It's not often I feel compelled enough to write my thoughts on a cd, but this chick Lily Allen deserves a few minutes of my time. I can't praise this cd enough. It's completey out of my diverse collection of genre....but after a few hundred listens to this cd (literally), it really hits every genre of my interest, coming to realize that this beauty is in a genre of her own. I do hope she continues on a successful path, if her follow up is even HALF as good as her first disc, I will love it just the same. Cheers to new talent, and to one who knows how to present good music. No fillers AT all on this cd, every song is infectious and addictive. Buy this cd, you will have no regrets. It's blowing me away! Cheers!"
3,Closer to Stand-up Comedy than Music,"You've heard by now that the driving device of this discis a cheerful, pop, upbeat caribe-o-funk sound track overwhich lily allen talks some snarky takes on men, love, herlittle brother and a summer ride through London.It's not a bad device, and it's perfectly in tune with thepseudo-irony of the music-buying generation. The lyrics arewry, sharply-observed and angry in an oh-so-polite middleclass british way. They are often funny enough to make youlaugh and the music is pleasantly infectious. The effect isof listening to a clever story, nicely told.The question, I guess, is will Lily Allen go beyond thiscute little trope. It's the kind of thing that works in alow-key way the first time it's done but gets stale quickly.I'm betting that this is one smart cookie who'll deliveron the lightly-made promise of this album.--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE andthe novel bang BANG. ISBN 9781601640005"
4,Looks better than standard a/v cables!,"Well, my one peeve is that the Wii doesn't support any resolution higher than 480p (yet). This causes some 'jaggies' (jagged edges) when playing games that aren't really designed with HDTV in mind. Other than that, though, this cable is great! I can't wait until Nintendo updates the Wii to support higher resolution (much like Microsoft did with the Xbox 360)."
5,"Madcatz Composite Cable for Wii, acheived 480i res, crystal clear",Crystal clear and 480i resolution which IIRC is maximum res output of WiiVery Pleased!
1,don't waste your money on these cables,I recently purchased these cables and I can tell you that the Wii looks better with the regular A/V cables they come with. I was very disappointed with the quality of these cables and look forward to actually getting another set of component Wii cables from a different manufacturer. These cables produce heavy vertical banding and actually wash out all of the colors.
1,Poor Quality,"Poorly shielded, and the cable I received was defective. It completely washed out the colors in the picture, and anything that was supposed to be gray displayed as pink. Spend a little more money on better cables if you want better picture quality."
3,Wii Component Cable,The component cable works. What more is there to say? I do notice a marked improvement in the display so that is a plus.
4,WII stereo HD cables,Good cables. Does what they are suppose to do-I like the stereo sound coming out of both the right and left speakers of my flat screen T.V.
2,Would probably be better to spend the $$ and get the official Nintendo cable,"Good packaging, good cable length. I plugged it into my component input and adjusted the Wii to 480p. I noticed something bad. Vertical scrolling from some interference. The cables are just not shielded enough to prevent interference from the back of the TV. I had to rearrange the cables for over an hour to get the verticle scrolling 'waves' to appear as minimal as possible. I was finally able to eliminate them, though at times I still feel like there is a slight shimmer, but whatever.Would probably be better to spend the $$ and get the official Nintendo cable."
1,spend the extra money for a different brand,The cables never quite worked. The color would go to blue or gray very often. The connection to the back of my TV was never snug. I used them for a weekend and they have been sitting in a box ever since. I ended up going to Target and spending $25 on Monster cables and they are working great. Lesson learned - you get what you pay for.
3,Not really HD,"I got a 720p television and figured my Wii would look a little sharper with these cables. I bough them, hooked them up, changed the video setting on my Wii... and noticed no difference. The Wii doesn't actually support HD video, but with these cables you're able to switch from 480i to 480p. I don't really notice much of a different, but supposedly is reduces some lag. At the very least it freed up my other video cable so that I can keep it in a travel bag and do not have to unhook everything if I'm taking the Wii over to a friends on on a vacation."
4,"Great, Practical Resource","If you are a novice at using a word wall or have had one in your classroom for some time, you will find this book to be a great, practical resource. It includes descriptions of many different kinds of word walls, not just the traditional wall with an alphabetical list of sight words. Also included are activities and lessons that you can use in conjunction with your word wall."
3,Hilarious at times,"colorful, zanny lemon is over the top,natalie wood is irresistable and her womanssuffrage is revealing at times for young ladiesto witness this aspect of the film, eye opening to seethat women were so treated, this was not that long ago!!!!pretty funny picture, and a classic, a must see for the familyall ages will enjoy the ridiculous professor fate."
4,"Great Race is ""Great Fun"" - 60's Nostalgia","This is a hokey/60's comedy with Tony Curtis as the Great Leslie and Jack Lemmon as a Great Villain character with his side-kick Peter Falk. No Blood and Gore / Good Clean Fun; and, a good musical score as well. I highly recommend it!!"
2,A shocking bomb,"Given the stars, the music, and Blake Edwards on a roll, one would think this film would have to be good. It isn't. The reviewers who raved probably like network sitcoms. I counted two laughs, which is less than one an hour. Slapstick by the Three Stooges is better and funnier. What went wrong? It's the script, I think. It depended entirely too much on gadgets and stunts designed to tickle teens. A waste of all concerned."
4,"""Brandy! Throw more brandy!""","This movie is great if you want to spend your time being entertained, not dissecting the problems of the world, trying to follow multiple plot twists, or recoiling in fear whenever someone enters an empty house. Made at a time when being funny required neither bad language nor scatological ""humor,"" the only drawback to this film is the annoying character played by Natalie Wood (who was absolutely luminous in West Side Story).Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, and Peter Falk are great by themselves and a riot when together. Jack Lemmon is a stand-out in his dual role, and the pie fight scene is spectacular.Alhough the timing of the film drags a bit here and there, this is the advantage of DVDS - one click and you can skip that scene. Otherwise highly recommended for simple fun."
5,"A True Slap Stick Classic, Over the Top and ALL!","Ive lost track of the number of times I've seen this movie. My laugh affair with the movie began at a very early age and at 33 it continues on as strong as ever! The characters are in easy to follow roles which allowed the actors to 'ham it up'. Memorable scenes abound throughout the movie:Professor Fate with his thumbs stuck in the periscope, the barroom brawl with Texas Jack (gotta love Larry Storch) while Dorothy Provine sings ""You shouldna hadna outna swang on me""...I still know all the words!, the Ice Float and Pie Fight rank as true classics. Perhaps best remembered for Jack Lemmon's playing Professor Fate ""Why you thimble headed Gurkin"", ""Id like to see the Great Leslie try that ONE"", and ""rise and shine, YOU rise YOU shine"" have become standard one liners in my family's daily banter! The list is as endless as some of the laughs....buy it and enjoy it for what it is...entertainment!"
2,The flop.,"Too much Jack lemmon yelling his lungs off! I was thankful for the intermission. I thought ""the venture to back in time"" would be entertaining, but I had only forgotten how bad the movie really was. nuf said."
4,"Well acted by all involved, but a plot that seems labored and listless.",The Great Race would seem a good companion to Those Magnificent Young Men in Their Flying Machines. But that is not the case. This film is overly long with a plot that should have been overhauled. One wishes that the climax would come soon but on and on it goes. If it was'nt for the great performances of all concerned I'm afraid this would have been a total flop. JHR
3,The Great Race DVD,"DVD was purchased for the family since the VHS version was worn out. I originally saw this movie in 1965 and again on Televisionin the early 70's. I purchased the VHS version in the mid 80's and my kids loved the movie as well. It is a very funny movie. However, the DVD version leaves out several hilarious scenes with was a great disappointment."
5,Classic comedy101,"This is one of the funniest slapstick comedys EVER! The famous stars, like Tony Curtis, Natalie Wood, Jack Lemmon & Peter Falk makes this a timeless movie to own and watch again and again! LOVE IT!"
5,Super comedy!,"THE GREAT RACE (1965) is an excellent movie. Interesting to make one about the early 1900's. Jack Lemmon is great in his ""Professor Fate"" role. Peter Falk does well as Max. This also includes Vivian Vance from I LOVE LUCY in a small role. This includes the biggest pie fight I've ever seen. This movie is more like a cartoon than a live-action film. This movie is 100% recommended.Grade: A+"
4,The Starting Guide For Any Horseplayer,"This is a brilliant book, but more importantly, it's the first must read for any individual looking to make money at the racetrack. I've spent close to 15 years betting on the ponies. I read Beyer's book when I was 13 and it gave me the foundation for my horse race handicapping success. The only issue a horseplayer will have is if he or she is prone to never changing their handicapping processes.So, Beyer's book is great, but it's not gospel.and they're off!: Stories From the Racetrack (Volume 1)"
5,Refreshing,"How refreshing to hear a someone in this day of American Idol, that can actually play an instrument. Most music today is not fit for the trash bin. However, Joe is an excellent musician with soul. The real selling point for me in the album is the great variety. From the rock of Had to Cry Today to the boogie of Revenge of the 10 Gallon Hat, to the excellent Flamencoesc Faux Mantini. Thanks Joe, for giving us something worth listening too."
1,Cuisinart Has Lost Their Edge,"I registered for this knife for a wedding gift. I was excited when my soon to be wife called to tell me that someone had bought the knife. My elation soon turned to disappointment once I began using this knife. The first thing I noticed was the ""non-stick"" dimples aren't very functional. Carrots, garlic, apples, chicken, etc all stick to the blade. Now approx. 6 weeks later, the blade has several deep pits as if someone has been chopping bones or metal (it has not been used for anything like that). This knife has only been used on a bamboo cutting board, washed and dried immediately after use. Now, I have a $40 knife that to me is worth less than the cheap Farberware knife I bought 4 yrs ago. I'm glad nobody bought the Cuisinart 21-Pc. cutlery set I registered for. I think I'll go with the J.A. Henckel set I originally considered."
2,"Barbie's (much) ""younger sister"" Kelly","Are we so gullible that we're going to believe that Kelly is Barbie's younger sister? Open your eyes. Barbie's younger sister is Skipper; Kelly is her dirty little secret. Barbie dates to an era where it was not uncommon for an unwed pregnant girl to be shipped of to ""stay with her aunt"" for a year, then after her return she would conveniently gain a ""baby sister"". Marlon Brando went most of his life call his grandmother ""mom"" and his mother ""sis""; google it for the details. The images and text accompanying the set of Barbie pushing Kelly in a stroller makes it clear what their true relationship is."
4,No refills!!!!,My daughter got this as a gift and she loved it...for all of ONE day! After she used all the mix and we couldn't get any more she totally lost all interest in it. I have written to Mattel on numerous occasions regarding this matter and have yet to receive a response. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.
2,Sony HVLIRH2 NightShot Infrared Light wasnt what I expected and didnt work as well as planned,The camera had a mode for low level light but it was very jerky. This intensified the ambient light but the picture was still jerky.
3,Not the best but still worth while,i read the official xbox magazine(oxm) review on this game and it got a 2/10 which doesnt seem fair to me but just because of one reason ...the co-op is worth checking out and so is the multiplayer..although i must say oxm was right when they say the graphics and sounds suck but if you can bypass the graphics and have some one you can invite over to play this game then i belive you should try it ...over all i gave it a 3 because of co-op and multi but dont expect to have any fun playing sinlge player ...the ai is stupid and its just annoying
5,Good movie,I really liked this movie. I don't like most movies that I watch. It's a great movie wether you are saved or unsaved. I think it would be a great movie to buy and then invite friends who are not Christian over to watch. It might get them asking questions. Thumbs Up!
4,Love covers a multitude of sin.,"Mercy Streets shows that through the power of God broken relationships from the past can be mended, people can get second chances, and serves as a reminder that we always have a choice. Twin brothers are each at a crossroad in their lives. Circumstances intervene, offering the opportunity for them to put their faith in God. It was a good story to watch with characters I actually cared about. It was a great way to spend my Easter morning."
1,a book of common sense....nothing more.,"this book was a major disappointment to me....it contains nothing more than common sense, with the same information repeated over and over again. it has too many chapters, each of which is too short with very little content. the book provides no unique insight or observations on the art of conversation. save your money, and don't buy this book."
5,Cracking Up,"The movie has one overriding theme, but a bunch of short segments tie it together. Hilarious! Can be viewed over & over again."
1,Not for Me,"This book was given to our family by a neighbor just after my brother-in-law died. It was a lovely gesture, and I am glad that so many people have been comforted by this book, but I must say that I found it trite and uninspiring. The poetry is poor, and the illustrations would rate as mediocre in children's book. The substance of the book is new-agey and shallow. For our grieving family, getting this book was like being handed a red balloon and being told that now everything would be okey dokey--it trivialized our experience. Please consider the sophistication of the recipient, as well as his or her belief in an afterlife, before giving this as a gift. It's not for everyone."
5,nice book,We usually look for books that are good to read to all of our children and this is one of them. Whether your children are 2 or 8 like ours I think they too will appreciate how special this book is.
1,Does not defend anything...,"Don't bother to buy this product.It will let a whole elephant in, but complain about a simple ping. Instead, your money is better spent on ZoneAlarm."
4,Not for dummies.,"I've been a user of BlackICE Defender for quite some time now. I've used it for many network sercutiry jobs, and businesses in the past. In true tests I've proven to different companies the vulnerabilities of BlackICE vs. the competition.One of the problems is that if you plan on buying this product and you belive you can just throw it onto your HDD, you will come up short with your home/office network. This product takes a bit of configuring with different ports and IP addresses. Once you've done all of this though, you have yourself a VERY good product that will not only block exploit from being run on your computer, it will simply terminate them and erase them in the progress due to it's application protection option.BlackICE is worth every penny....if you know what you're doing with it."
2,ZoneAlarm has it all plus more and it is free,"One reviewer from Ocala, FL United States wrote, ""After [zonealarm] allowing admittance I have found out that while downloading free programs, my Black Ice Defender will allow downloading but will block attempts by the downloading program to access my files and send back info to its source.""Zone Alarm does this too but it also encrypts the reference to the program so a trojan horse cannot spoof ZoneAlarm.""Black Ice keeps a detail record of all hacker type attempts as well as pointing a finger back to where the attack came from."" Zone alarm does this too.The best on the market is actually free. Search for ZoneAlarm and go with the product our Network Administrator's use at home."
2,BlackIce vs. ZoneAlarmPro,"I have tried both and ZoneAlarm wins hands-down. Try it for yourself, put your system through the independent security test found atThe fact is BlackIce can't help control what access an application has to the internet. An important plus in ZoneAlarm in an age when many viruses are internet-aware."
5,How did I get along for so long without it?,"I love this book; it is a wealth of information that is not easily found anywhere else! Unfortunately, I am in the middle of a move and my copy is packed away in storage. If you spend long hours pouring over family history details, buy this book."
3,"Best for thin, individual cables","While they are called 2 inch covers, you only get about 1 inch in total, 1/2 on each side, so it is best used with individual cables, like HDMI. If you are using RGB, you will need to separate the wires.Easy to install and looks good on the wall - especially once they are painted. Clean look."
4,Works Well For My Needs - Recommended!,"This OmniMount Cable Cover Management Cover set is easy to install and looks as lot better than the bare cables running down the wall. We are using this in our small business to cover the wires running to a wall mounted HDTV we use to highlight our products and services, but I wouldn't hesitate to use these in my home if needed.The set comes with all of the mounting hardware (including screws and wall anchors), 3 x 16"" long covers, a 90 deg angle corner piece, and two end caps. This means your longest run can only be a total of 4' or less (the pieces are able to be trimmed with a box cutter), which was just right for us. We are running a power cord, and two HDMI cables through these and it is a bit of tight squeeze, but they do fit.This worked well for my needs, recommended!CFH"
2,too much effort,"After getting this item in the mail and reading the mounting instructions, this ended up more than I wanted to put together. I ended up hiding the cables behind a curtain."
2,Omni Cable Managment,"I was very disappointed in the way Amazon promoted this product. I bought this because it was shown as something other people bought when they were buying the omni shelf. So I bought it as a set, well I know I should have paid better attention as the shelf had about a 4 inch cable management system and this was maybe 2 inches so they do not go together at all. I am sure that it would work fine if that is what you want but I spent $20 on something that didn't work for me because of the way Amazon promoted it."
3,Mer.,"Bought these to cover up cords under our flatscreen to the DVD & cable box and must say that I wasn't very impressed. It works fine enough to cover it up, but it doesn't stick to the wall for longer than like 3 months! Granted, there are a bunch of cables in there, but it FITS under the flap - it just doesn't stick to the wall. We have to stick double-sided tape every few months and hope it stays ""this time"". Also, we are using two of the long peices and am kinda bummed that there isn't a connection part to keep the two together - I think this would solve the wall issue, as well as look nicer. ah well..."
2,Looks a bit better,"It does hide the cables but the double sided tape sucks! May need to glue, which then defeats the purpose for not damaging your wall."
4,Great romance,"This has been one of my old favorites - a sweet, touching romance between two folks who are cousins (by marriage). It's fun to watch Ted Danson and Isabella Rosselini play tricks on their spouses, who are cheating on them. You can believe the romance that is developing as they move from being friends to much more. A great, overlooked, romantic comedy."
4,A giggle and a tear jerk.,"It is quite an odd thing for a biting satirist like Vonnegut to write a children's story. Odder still is the way this one was written. First the artist provided the pictures, then Vonnegut wrote words to fit them. Telling in an unusually ""cute"" style the sights that met the eyes of Baby Jesus just after being born, the story is likely to make the reader feel young and innocent again"
4,This novel rocks,"If you like the game you'll love the novel, it gives an itersting point of veiw for many of the games main characters and adds to the feel of resident evil 2's story :)"
1,LET OTHER AUTHORS HAVE A CHANCE,LET OTHER AUTHORS HAVE A CHANCE AT WRITING A RESIDENT EVIL BOOK.I DO NOT LIKE PERRYS STYLE AT ALL.THE ENDING ON THIS BOOK IS AWFUL SHE TOTALLY IGNORES THE CHARACTERS FROM THIS STORY SIMPLY TO PLUG HER NEXT BOOK UNDERWORLD.AWFUL!ALSO SHE STICKS TO MUCH TO THE GAME AND DOESN'T EXPAND THE STORY ENOUGH LIKE MOST AUTHORS DO WHEN WRITING ABOUT A GAME.PERRY HAS WRITTEN LIKE 7 BOOKS FOR RESIDENT EVIL AND MOST OF THEM ARE AWFUL.I HOPE THEY FINALLY DECIDE TO LET OTHER AUTHORS HAVE A SHOT AT WRITING A RESIDENT EVIL STORY SO MANY PEOPLE CAN SEE WHAT THEY ARE MISSING.
1,Poor connectivity,"I've have experience poor connectivity with this card. The connection keeps dropping, especially when WEP is enabled. (I have the latest version of the drivers). (I haven't tried this card with any 802.11g routers, only 802.11b)."
1,I STRONGLY discourage this one!,"I strongly discourage the purchase of a Panasonic VCR. My husband and I purchased one just this past July. After just one week of use, it started squeaking like a hamster wheel. Well, just two weeks ago, only 4 months later, it broke completely! We had to buy another new VCR to replace it, since the warranty is only 90 days. Maybe it was just one ""bad apple"". However, we don't plan to ever purchase Panasonic again. We bought a Symphonic this time. Our original Symphonic lasted 6 years!"
2,Blade is thick,"I was looking for a grafting knife and have had other Bahco tools, so I figured I would try this one. When the package came it had the right cartoon pictures of the grafting process on it for a grafting knife, the knife had the right size and weight for a grafting knife, and it was sharp enough to be a grafting knife. Unfortunatly it has (in my view) the wrong blade for a grafting knife - thick and beveled on both sides. It would probably be good for splitting clefts, but it is too thick and angled for tounge and whip grafting."
5,~* You supply the Magick *~,"Just a big empty journal with instructions on how to consecrate your new book. Those of you who know what a ""Book of Shadows"" is for WON'T be disappointed. The pages are unlined but I can live with that. ~BB~"
2,Not for photographers,"Very involved graphic techniques. Probably excellent effects for a graphic artist, but not much value for editing and tweaking photos. Certainly a waste of time and money for those of us just interested in photography."
3,Entertaining But Could Have Better Explanations,"This book would be better titled ""The History of Philosohy for Beginners."" The book tells what the philosophers thought but often did not explain what their thoughts meant. In addition, I think more explanations of the questions the philosophers are trying to answer would be more helpful. It seemed that this book highlighted the answers of the individual philosophers without really explaining the questions they were trying to answer. However, I found that some of the questions were revealed when the book had a comic strip describe how another philosopher answered the same question. I did enjoy reading this book though, and after reading this I feel that I have a much better grasp of philosophy.On a syntax note, the author of the book used UK english (e.g. labor is written labour), so I got thrown off a few times, thinking there was a typo."
1,Save your money!,"I bought this book to help ""translate"" a very densely written required book for a doctoral-level philosophy class in which I am enrolled. I have never taken a philosophy class. So, I was eager to read Philosophy for Beginners. What a disappointment. This book has a very choppy writing style and the cartoons are confusing because they do not have a context. Unless I missed it, there was nothing about Plato's Forms, a major omission. I REALLY wanted to read the authors' take on Russell. Though they list Russell in the Index, Freud is in his place. I also bought Philosophy Made Simple by Popkin and Stroll. Buy that book instead."
1,Poor batteries,I fully charged my NIMH batteries like instructed the first time and have only had the worst results from these batteries! Somewhere between 10-15 pictures is the batteries life
3,Elegant Baby Chocolate bank,"Great quality. I have purchased several other banks and loves them. I returned this one however, because the blue was too light; almost white. Didn't like it"
1,ABSOLUTE JUNK!,This is your classic Chinese-made junk...rusted like a tin can within no time flat! Got a full refund. Buy American. Go USA!
4,So far so good,The fire pit has been a nice addition to my patio during the december chill. It's used frequently and appears to be holding up well. My only problem is the screen appears to weaken when used during the fire and becomes mis-shapen. it is also starting to rust. All in all a good investment for the use it's getting.
3,Brighter is not always better...,"This product works great if you want the sun to be out at night. I admit it's my fault for not knowing that a single 10 watt light is impossible to look at without causing pain in low light situations (and this contains two lights). I'm sure this light has a purpose, especially if any distance is involved in dark locations, but I'm mostly trying to add a little more light for indoor recording of my new son, so I'm going to purchase the 3 watt light and hope that it's a better choice for my needs.If you need an extremely bright light that sucks batteries this is it. Don't forget that the 20 watt option is only available with the larger battery packs which starts to make the camcorder heavy."
3,some good songs hidden amongst discardable pop,"Most of the songs on this cd sound like generic pop songs, however there are some songs like the recognised masterpiece Psycotic Reaction that make this cd worth checking into. The songs near the end tend to be better than the rest."
5,A Roller Coaster Ride of the Cold War Kind,"From the first fifteen pages Masterton grabs you by the collar and shakes you about roughly as he takes you through an espionage thriller of the best kind. Masterton's plot takes us from the death of a secret agent in Belgium across the globe as a plot to end the cold world unfolds between the United States, Great Britain and Russia. Planning to divide the planet evenly, the three super powers agree to hand over certain territories, like Europe, for a little give and take of territories aimed at ending the cold war once and for all. As agents and innocents begin to see the writing on the wall all hell starts to brake loose. Agents start fleeing, dying, getting nailed to walls just for their advac knowledge of the game that's being played. If you like cold war thriller's you'll love Sacrifice."
3,"Works great on Windows XP, not on Vista","This flash drive worked flawlessly on my PC running Windows XP. When I upgraded (?) to Windows Vista, it refused to load (open) any of my encrypted files. I contacted Edge customer support (?) several times by email, but they did not acknowledge. They never responded. If you plan on running Windows XP for the rest of your life, this drive will do well for you."
4,Why?...,"This is one of the greatest comedy/horror movies ever, taking the bizzareness of Bruce Campbell and some... ""interesting"" special effects scenes and combining them to make a movie which can only be called ""wierd, but in a good way.""Unfortunately I didn't buy the right DVD of this great movie. This version may contain the original ending, but it left out the other, alternate ending, which in my mind was about as funny as the original ending. It didn't seem to have many special features, which I do remember the version I rented having (although I had things to do, so I didn't get to watch them). If you want to get this movie, I don't think this would be the version you want."
5,THIS MOVIE IS GREAT,"BRUCE CAMBELL is awesome in this one. This movie is hilarious. It is a two disc set. It has a 20 minute featurette, theatrical trailer, deleated scenes, commentary, a storyboard viewer while watching the movie, a original ending and more. There is a little book in the case. This movie is awesome.If you liked Evil Dead you will like this one except for one thing there is no gore in this one.If you watch closely at the battle seen at end, when he brings out his car and hits the skeletons with that spinning type of thing on the front of his car, the part where he chops the two in half and it shows it in slow motion, it shows that same seen three times from different angles. One from close up slow motion. One from side, and one in fast motion from far away. There might be more but I am not sure.This movie is great for a action, comedy fans. it's worth the money."
2,"Buy the original, this sucks. Hail to the Editors Baby!","I bought this in the hope that I'd see more Bruce Campbell wise cracks. What you get is the theatrical feature with ungraded cuttings from the editing room floor glued in with chewing gum and paperclips. The original film is one of my all time favorites and this version proves that editors do a very good job by removing anything that is unneccesary, misleading or of poor film-making quality. This DVD is basically everything that is great about Army of Darkness with added unneccesary, misleading and poor quality footage.Hail to the Editors baby!"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Campy beyond belief (and intentionally so), Army of Darkness is not a particularly good movie and the weakest of its trilogy, but worth a look if you're in the mood for some schlocky comedy delivered by camp-master Bruce Campbell."
4,MID-EVIL DEAD !,"This is Sam Raimi & Bruce Campbell's full on over the top action packed horror comedy ""ARMY OF DARKNESS"". Loaded with groundbreaking special efx(for the time),plenty of red stuff & more ASH *one liners* then we can handle! A.O.D. is a very fun super slapstick cult classic & this 2 disc boomstick S.E. containing both the U.S. ""THEATRE RELEASE"" & the ""DIRECTOR'S CUT"" is in my opinion the version to have!"
3,Rent before you buy this version of Army of Darkness,"Please rent this DVD to decide whether you really want to buy it or not. The extras (commentary, deleted scenes) are wonderful, but it's pretty obvious that some of the scenes in this version of the movie (the ""director's cut,"" for what it's worth) were taken from rough footage. The quality of the video gets so low that it looks like a VCD. I was slightly shocked that a new, shiny, special version of Army of Darkness would have problems like this, but I guess that's why they call it a Director's Cut. I'm going to keep it, but only for the commentary and extras. I'll have to buy the plain-jane version if I want to watch the movie."
5,More from the master,"Sam is a bada$$. In this third chapter of the Evil Dead trilogy, he sets up Bruce fully into his wise-a$$ Ash character. You can see the Three Stooges influences in the graveyard scene. Chock full of puppet skeletons, and fire-hose blood gushing, this movie lands right on top of the B movie pile. Hail to the King, baby."
3,"Great movie, buy a different DVD version though","Buyers beware. This is the orginal version of the movie and contains only the original ending, not the S-mart ending. There are other minor things that are also different but I cannot recall. Not a bad dvd but there isn't anything on this one that you can't find on the boomstick edition or any other special edition version that hascome out."
4,Don't get the Bootleg Edition!!!,"I know it's tempting, but don't do it!! The regular editions ending is soooooo much better than the one in the bootleg. I always found this one of the funniest parts of the whole movie. There are two great lines at the end of the movie: The monster in the store asks Ash who the hell he is, and he answers, like James Bond ""The Names Ash....Housewares."" He then proceeds to shoot the heebiegeebies out of the monster, and the other line I won't ruin. I find this to be the best of the Evil Dead Trilogy, but the second one is not far behind. The regular edition DVD is awesome, and the bootleg just screws it up. Buy the regular, it's worth the extra 5 bucks."
4,A great deal of fun. I was surprised.,"That third Evil Dead episode totally amazed me.Probably because it went one step further in thathorror/comedy style that is so unique to Sam Raimi.This movie is loaded with fun and gags left and right.I have never found Ash so funny. Lots of good ideastoo and quite an impressive output with the limitedmeans involved at the time.I might reproach that the horror/gore part is a littletoo small, compared to Evil Dead I and II, but it'sstill a very enjoyable movie.I found it quite different than the other two, whichis what I was most surprised by.The innovative sense of Mister Sam makes this moviea must have in the genre. Of course, that might notbe a movie for everyone. Some people might find itreally stupid. It depends what frame of mind youwatch it in. I personally had a lot of fun. I wishthe movie was longer!"
2,A classic movie . . . but this cut [stinks]!,"I love Army of Darkness. I waited in line for four hours to see Bruce Campbell's book signing. He autographed my Army of Darkness t-shirt. Theoretically, I should love this DVD. But they cut out the best part! For those who have seen it, I can tell you that the real ending is nowhere on the DVD, replaced by the ""original"" ending. And when you see it, you will realize why they re-did it. No Bridget Fonda, no ""Lady, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave the store."" Granted, the Audio commentary is great, which saves this disc from getting one star out of pure spite. But come on. Would it have killed them to include the real ending? Or was this a cynical ploy to force us to buy two copies? Why should I buy this if I have to ALSO buy the real version to get the full effect? Ridiculous. If you are a hardcore AOD fan and want the commentary, buy this. If you want to see it for the first time, get another edition. This one doesn't cut it."
3,No Commentary,"My favorite movie, but I'm not buying the DVD until it has a commentary. Thats the best part of any DVD."
2,HAIL TO EVIL DEAD AND DEAD BY DAWN,"My god this is a WEAK entry in the great Evil Dead series. Evil dead and Evil dead II are both extreme horror masterpieces when all this one is is a piece of crap. Sam Raimi did absolutely TERRIBLE directing along with CRAPPY writing and THE WORST OF ALL ACTING AND THEE WORST SPECIAL EFFECTS ON THE PLANET....1992...Hell Jurassic Park was released in 1992. Now Compare FX. You people who gave this film 5 stars....you have NO idea what your talking about. I love the first 2 evil deads and this one puts shame on the series. Sorry Sam, dont play that tune again."
2,Not up to standards of Evil Dead 1 and 2,This movie was really pretty bad. Hard to know where to start. The whole story was just pretty disjointed and the animation was cheesy. Definitely didn't live up to the standard (if you can call it that) set by ED 1 and 2.
1,THIS SELLER SUCKS,I never received my item after a month and my money had been sent I tried to email the seller but never heard a response. I hate to be harsh but if I was going to buy from here I would go a different direction.
4,Same as the Limited Edition - but highly recommended,"= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =DVD PICTURE QUALITY - 2 STARSDVD SOUND QUALITY - 5 STARSDVD EXTRA MATERIAL - 3 STARS- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -MY PERSONAL RATING - 4 STARS- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -O V E R A L L - 4 S T A R S= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =PICTURE QUALITY: Pretty bad!!

Very bad transfer, same as the limited edition.SOUND QUALITY: Great, nothing to complain.EXTRA MATERIAL: Well I think the best ""extra"" is the director's cut itself. Very funny the extended scenes, but the rest is average.Good reasons why you should buy THIS DVD:- Director's Cut (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!)- CommentaryA must have for everyone who doesn't already have the Limited Edition!!"
4,"""Favorite Evil Dead Film!""",Bruce Campbell stars in Sam Raimi's 1992 horror sequel.A man is sent to 1300 A.D. battling the undead for anancient book. This is my favorite of the trilogy andBruce is great in this as usual. This dvd has goodpicture and sound plus some neat extras. Get this.
5,this is my boom stick!!!,"The undisputed king of corny horror goes to sam raimis horribly brilliant flick. While evild dead (1, and 2) seem almost like the tone is saposed to be horror( but really is just funny) aod is geared more or less to a more spoofish kind of schlock film that lets the bruce cambell i have come to love make his appearnce. His script in itself could create a brand new die hard movie its got so many bad one-liners. The special affects are not too special and the plot isn't exactly oscar award winning stuff. So whats so great about it? IT'S F***#@ING HILLARIOUS. The true definition of a cult classic..this movie has stood the test of time..very very low budget...and yet it doesnt matter because its brilliant in its own way. go ahead and check it out if you havent already."
3,This Version sucks if you saw the initial version,"OK...this version is only good if you cannot get hold of the 2 disc version or the original release. It's had too much cut out and changed that made the film a classic! This is not as funny and has removed many of the ""Cult"" lines. Only buy this one if you don't wish to pay more...or can't find the 2 disc:)RegardsChristian"
5,Horror and Comedy Put In A Blender on Liquify,"Army of Darkness is a perfect blend of comedy and horror. This is the thrid movie of the Evil Dead series which stars Bruce Campbell (Evil Dead, Hercules, Jack of All Trades, Maniac Cop, Down Periscope, and more) and is directed by Sam Raimi (Darkman, For Love of the Game, The Quick and the Dead, and more). Army of Darkness is a top notch film that goes from being original to genius. Bruce Campbell gets thrown back in time and the only way he can get home is by obtaining the Necronomicon (The Book of the Dead). Along his quest he encounters hilarious enemies and situations. I have not met a person yet that has not enjoyed this film thoroughly from sheer fascination, hysterical laughter, or both! Superb acting, excellent direction/producing, hysterically funny special effects. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
2,Great movie! Bad DVD,"Right off the bat let me say that the visual quality of this DVD is THEE worst i have ever seen. I saw the movie twice in the theater and at least a half dozen times on VHS and i never remember that quality being this bad. Some of the scenes are restored beautifully, while some are just horrible. The action scenes are a blurry mess, especially the windmill scene. Very distracting. The fact that this is Director approved makes me question Sam Raimi's ability as a Filmmaker. Another big problem i had with this film is that it's not Dolby 5.1. A six speaker system is wasted here. 2.0 is weak weak weak! The deleted scenes are interesting and the commentary is entertaining but it's not enough for me to recommend this DVD to anyone."
3,"Great Movie, Bad DVD",This DVD is 15 minutes shorter than the theatrical version of the film. It leaves out some of my favorite parts. Take my advice and save up $20 more and buy the director's cut.
5,A fantastic and little-known collection,"I've always liked Margaret Atwood, but with this collection I now have to say I love her. Many typically unsentimental stories with strong women characters, and none one-dimensional. Each story has stayed with me in its own way. This is one to try."
1,Absolute Drivel,"Don't waste your time.An amateur night at the set, whoever though Shane Perdue (?) was a suitable actor must belong to an extraterrestrial culture. Awfully shot and written, full of loopholes and inaccuracies, even Nero looks properly embarrassed.An ""Ambulance chasing"" production a viewer must avoid at all costs. Ugh."
4,Another Great Read By Tony Lindsay,"This was another great read by Tony Lindsay...The story wasn't as entertaining as ""One Dead Preacher"", but it was a good story. The beauty of this story lies within the characters. Ladies will absolutely fall in love with Johnny. His looks, intellect and sweetness make you want to take him home. Pam was funny, gritty and smart enough to know when to let the b.s. go. The other characters were wonderful as well and make you feel as if you can just go around the corner or the next family reunion to find them...."
2,Repetitive and Wandering,"After reading books on Reagan and Bush published by University of Press Kansas I had higher expectations than what this book delivered. It is actually written by several people with Fink and Graham editing. This causes several problems, the worst of which is repetition. Fink and Graham frame the major issues at the beginning of the book, and the contributors spend half of the rest of the book repeating what was already written. Also, none of the contributors were actually close enough to the source to offer interesting insight--most of the book seemed to be sourced from the AP. Ironically, the book suffered from many of the same problems as the Carter administration: too many people too distanced from the subject trying to be too objective and never delivering on clear goals. These sort of topical overviews are better handled by one author."
3,The Last of Integrity,"Policy Choices in the Post-New Deal Era is a decent albeit short discourse on the Carter presidency. While the fanatics on the far right consider him a failure and Reagan the Holy Trinity, reality paints a different picture. After Nixon's paranoid wreckage of the Constitution and the economy due to the Vietnam War, resulting in the gas crisis, unemployment, recessions and stagflation, Carter stepped into a situation not much better than Obama faces after succeeding the worst president in the history of America. Carter was a president of integrity, something sorely lacking in all of the post presidencies, including the corporate spokesman with a charge card Ronald Reagen, whose policies instigated what bears fruit now. One of Reagan's first orders as president was to remove the solar panels Carter had placed on the White House. This reveals more significance now that man-made global warming is undisputed except for those dwellers from the mythical town of Mayberry."
3,"Good cookbook, awful (ebook) layout","Unfortunately these are the types of things that you can't catch when you download a sample of a book, and only find once you purchase it - the ebook layout is awful and clunky. Recipes are spaced weirdly, ingredients are missing, and the layout just needs to be reworked for the digital format.Other than that, the recipes look pretty decent. Some slightly esoteric ingredients, but if you live near a Japanese store you'll have no problem tracking them down."
3,"Sony HVL-20DW2 Video Light for use with DCRVX2100, HDRFX1 & FX7","i guess its ok depending on what u need it for, not worth as much as it is , comes with one light bud no battery"
4,First Punk Rock?,"Maybe the first punk rock. ""Talk Talk"" WAS punk, and would be considered that if it were released today. Cool stuff. The slower tunes are mellowed with the keyboard, and there are a few covers, but the real classics hee are the rockin' originals. It's sixties garage, with somewhat more advanced lyrics, and lots of feeling. ""Louie, Louie"" by the Kingsmen, ""Boss Hoss"" by the Sonics, and ""Surfin' Bird"" by the Trashmen were all really ""punk before punk"", and dare we include some of the Troggs stuff? But this is where the angry attitude came into the musical style, this and ""Satisfaction"" by the Rolling Stones."
3,Poor selection,"There have been better Music Machine collections released-- that""Dark White"" wasn't included on this one is a major gaffe. Either that or they're trying to get you to buy this AND the Ignition CD as well (it won't work on me, I still have the vinyl collection LP which is way better). I agree that they spent too much time on covers when it is through their originals that they really shine..."
4,Anne is back!,"If you have been a faithful reader of Mrs. Rice' Vampire chronicles & felt, as I did, that you were somewhat shamelessly abused as she forced us - the readers - to struggled with her through her own personal crisis of religious faith, then fear no more. ANN IS BACK! In full & glorious bloom. She writes with the same lovely artistry & purity as she wrote Interview & Lestat.Blood and Gold is one of the best in the series. Well at least in the top four. If she frightened you off with the dreadfully vapid & didactic Memnoch or the almost worse, & definitely more religiously pedantic, Vittorio all I can say is, for this one book at least, it's safe to come back to feast on dark blood. And I recommend that you don't cheat yourself out of this finely woven & beautifully colored epic."
1,Pathetic,"I loved so many of Anne Rice's works - The Vampire Lestat, Cry to Heaven, Lasher, Taltos - those books were a thick stew of plot, history and human interest. In comparison, this book is watered-down soup from a can. It's embarrassing, I can't believe she allowed it to be published - it's as formulaic as a Silhouette romance. I couldn't even make it to the end."
2,Mrs. Rice has written much better,"All of Anne Rice's work from the last five years would have benefited from some editorial assistance. Unfortunately for her fans, she has the right to refuse it because, from the excellent reputation she gained from her earlier work, she rakes in the money for her publisher. ""Violin"" was tedious, ""Pandora"" was mediocre, ""Vitorio"" was awful, and ""Blood and Gold"" is redundant."
3,Go slow to go fast?,"The first half of this book was agonizingly slow. The first few pages were good but then it slowed to a snail's pace until Marius encounters Eudoxia. Even after that he seems to belabor the same points over and over...barely varying his verbage.Of course I'll still read the next book, but every time I buy one of Rice's books these days, I question why I'm so loyal."
2,Bored to tears,"First I'd like to say that I'm a huge Anne Rice Fan!! and a devoted Vampire Chronicle reader-but-and this is big- this book doesn't live up to the series. It's filled with lovely historical references and images that would be great for a documentary on the history channel. Unfortunately it's a painful read, like a wordy text book on the Roman empire narrated by Marius the vampire. If this is your first Anne Rice purchase just go for The Vampire Lestat forget you ever heard of this book."
2,Blood and Gold,"Blood and Gold...the story of Marius and the 8th volume of the Vampire Chronicles. After being lonely for years, Marius attracts the attention of a vampire who has recently come out of a long exile or hibernation period. Thorne, this mysterious vampire, has come craving the sound of voices and words. Marius agrees to share his story. However, Thorne wants more than just a story. He is full of anger towards his maker, Maharet, and wishes revenge.This book was a disappointment, as for a lot of the novel, it felt like I was re-reading The Vampire Armand (which I didn't particularly enjoy either). There was little new to Marius' story that the reader hasn't heard about in the previous novels whether it was Those Who Must Be Kept, or Marius' time as a painter in Venice with Armand and Bianca. Even the new plot with Thorne failed to grab me, as it wasn't deeply explored at all. I am hoping that Blackwood Farm and Blood Canticle will be more interesting to end the series strongly."
2,"Got my Vamp fix, but beyond that...","Every year or so, I need a little Vampire fiction in my life... that's just the way it is with me. From that standpoint, Blood and Gold was satisfying. However, I think the plot gets slow and redundant in spots, and the over-story of the Norse vampire was undertold. I don't think this ranks in my top 5 Anne Rice books."
3,Could have been great....,"This film is wonderfully chilling and makes excellent use of suspense throughout but unfortunatley is let down in it's underlaying theme. The director's obsession with the subject of faith does not rest and it's kind of rammed down the viewer's throat in a rather shallow and patronising way. Shalyman has an obvious talent but rather spoilt this potentially fantastic film with his cheesy narrative drive.Certainly worth watching as it is still well made, drawing all the ingredients of a good sci-fi/thriller (but with a couple of unneccessary ones thrown in.)"
5,I loved it!,"Most Directors get a project to direct and they are praised for it. Very few write their own material and are able to visually make a masterpiece for all of us to enjoy.I loved this film for its many undertones that the storyline takes you through.It's not a science fiction film, it's a drama about a family and how they deal with life, with an alien invasion and ultimate how they are redeemed by the signs that were there all along.This film comes together beautifully. A definite classic of our time."
4,Paging Mr. Hitchcock...,"I like M. Night Shyamalan's movies. I confess that my review of the movie is going to be colored by this. I thought that the movie was really suspenseful, and it kept me guessing until the end. I've read some reviewers saying that this movie is corny, and has some obvious holes in the plot. Well duh, there are very few movies of this kind that don't have gaps in logic, but sometimes you have to suspend your disbelief for an hour and a half and just enjoy a movie. I think that the absolute best thing about this movie is what is not shown to you. Shyamalan took a lesson from Hitchcock and shows that your mind does a much better job of scaring you than pouring gallons of blood across the screen.As for the DVD extras, it is pretty standard fare. Deleted scenes, interviews, and documentaries, nothing that I was super impressed with, but I haven't yet bought a DVD based upon the awesome documentaries that go with it.Buy this DVD is you are a fan of Shyamalan's movies."
5,great suspense!,"Signs is one of the best movies that i have seen in a long time, it encompass great suspense with a great specturm of acting to boast. The movie is set in a Pennsylvania farm town where a corn farmer, Mel Gibson (Who is a retired minister who left serving the Lord because his wife died), finds unusual singns made in his corn field one night. Without giving too much of the movie away, these signs pop up all over the world, and an interesting twist that runs throughout the movie is revealed at the end, which brings Mel Gibson back to his pastoral position."
3,"Ok, but a bit boring","I was extremely excited to see this film, as it seemed a good bet. I was however, somewhat disappointed. The premise of the film was sound, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Instead of focusing on what seems to be the point of the film, alien invasion, it comes across as a 21st century version of the biblical story of the prodigal son. Rather than the prechiness, I would have much more preferred knowing more about the aliens. Hopefully, when the DVD comes out, there will be some alternate endings, or deleted scenes included that will better explain what seemed to be the underdeveloped plot."
2,The Big Let Down...,"This is a huge let down from ""The Sixth Sense"" for M. Nite Shama Lama Ding Dong. This, quite simply, was not a good movie. The acting was subpar, dialogue was weak and using crop circles really didn't create a whole lot of intrigue. The behaviors of the children were boring and predictable. The movie does an average job of creating the need to see the aliens, but when we actually see them, it was as disappointing as the rest of the movie. Do yourself a favor, see the ""Sixth Sense"" for a second time, rather than this underachieving mistake."
1,Signs of a bad movie...,"What an awful movie! It starts out like a serious ""what if?"" flick and turns into a laughable comic book. When things start getting scary, and you and I might think about getting out, the characters don't. I saw this movie a couple years ago and was laughing so hard I forgot most of the details. If you like 1950s camp horror movies with bad direction and stupid characters, you might get a charge out of this one. The only 'signs' in front of this movie should have been stop signs keeping us out of the theater where we wasted 8 bucks."
1,BOO,What was he thinking???? I could have come up with a better story than that. The plot so full of holes. the actors did a good job but the film is a bust. But it need to be writen better ast to not have som many holes.
2,this was a scary movie?,"ok, talk about absolutely a 0 star movie. ok. the acting was good. i mean we are talking about academy award winning actors. (not in this movie) i dont understand this movie at all. there are like 1,000 questions to be answered at the end. and you want to know the lamest part about the movie? the way the aliens attack! i was expecting some sort of cool special effect, but it was soo dumb. rent the movie you will know what i mean! and of course, they go after the one house where mel gibson and his family lives! i mean come on! and who in the world would believe mel as a priest? get real! dont buy this movie!"
1,B-O-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-I-N-G,"This is the slowest, flattest, lamest movie I have ever seen. Save your money. Do not be insulted into buying this movie by reviewers like miamix. They are embarassed at having wasted money on the crud and want everyone else to suffer, too. Hafway through the movie, Phoenix tells you ""this movie is War of the Worlds"". LISTEN TO HIM! It is, even down to the ending. Watch the original War of the Worlds, instead."
4,"""Signs"" scores high on two levels","I very much enjoyed ""Signs"" both for the horror thrills it offers and the underlying story line of family, loss, renewal all centered around a rousingly scarry event. M. Night proves once again his sense of storytelling unfolding before you with a pace that builds the suspense levels and then some comic moments of relief. Mel Gibson does a good job as the father, have seen him better but this is by no means a ""throw-away"" performance. He runs the required gamut of emotions with ease and he once again proves his versatility. The supporting cast is fine, especially the two children. The special effects are minimal and well done, but most of the ""effects"" are left to your imagination. And isn't that the best effect of all?I would recommend this movie to all who enjoy a good scarry tale, tipped slightly with plot-enhancing reality-stretching moments. Overall a good couple of hours well spent."
4,Less is more,"I enjoyed this film a lot. I liked how the scale was kept small, meaning that the focus was on the farmhouse and family, with only tidbits from the outside world entering the plot. That's what real life is like; something big may be happening, but for most of us, we experience only a tiny little corner of that event.My only qualm about the film was the plot device of water as a weapon. If these guys can't take water, why go to a planet that is 3/4 water? Perhaps the filmmaker was trying to use water symbolically; after all, it is used for baptism.My only problem with the DVD itself is that there is no option to include the deleted scenes (most of which are really good) into the film in order to makes a sort of Director's Cut. Or if there is, I didn't notice it."
2,Not a very good movie,"This is really not very good. The suspense is effective for the fisrt half or so, and the acting is OK. But the suspense is ruined as you start to see more and more of the aliens. The ending continues this trend and is ultra corny to boot. This is probably the worst Mel Gibson Movie I've seen."
5,Try using your imagination!,"Not every movie has to be perfect and SIGNS isn't. The reason most people don't like this movie is because it doesn't follow and formulas and it is different. Out society is so used to the dumb scary movies that are supposed to scare us but they don't because they are all [the same]. This movie is something new and unique, get a grip and realize what it is really about! M. Night is awesome!!"
1,Absolutley Boring,"I watched this at my friends sleep over, we all fell asleep, this movie was boring. mel Gibson has done better than this. It is not scary at all."
3,Enjoyable film,"I found the movie to be enjoyable and interesting to watch. The scenery and sound effects were very good. Although in retrospect the story line was a bit weak, and the story was not set up very well, (it almost seems that you are missing the lead-in), we still found the movie suspenseful, and entertaining (which is why we watch movies in the first place). The linking of crop circles to alien invasion was also very thought provoking. Director Night should refrain from acting, as him performance was weak and unbelievable. His writing skills are excellent and there were a lot of little details in each scene that warranted a second look. Overall not as good as Sixth Sense or Unbreakable. The extras on the DVD were really great, from info on crafting the film to the building of the set, a must watch portion of the DVD not just filler."
4,It was really good but.....,The beginning of this movie was strong kept you guessing and made you think. The last half hour or so was crap. The alien looked completely fake and that aliens are like alergic to water is b.s.. Overall though the movie was good for the most part.
4,"Not M Night's best, but better than most","This M Night's follow-up to his now classics, Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. In my opinion this is his not his best work, but far and away better than most of the hollywood garbage out there. The common theme in Night's movies has been the suprise or plot twisting ending and this one is no different. The ending is not as shocking or high profile as in his previous 2 movies, but that doesn't take away from it's effect.The movie is about a rural family in the middle of an invasion by aliens. This is not a monster or alien movie as you only get to see them twice in the whole movie. It is more about the things we take for granted and the things we see as flaws. As the title implies, it's about signs.I was a little disappointed by the slight shortage of extras, but there are some. All in all, this is a top notch movie and a quality DVD. Go get it! (I just hope they don't release another version of it!)"
3,Alien invasion,"In this movie, Mel Gibson plays the father of two who left the ministry after his wife died in an accident. Suddenly there are strange signs carved out of his cornfield and he and his brother wonder whether this is by accident or design. Television reports describe similar occurrences all over the world and a pattern begins to emerge. He and his brother disagree over whether they will be protected from harm by the threatening forces around them. Tension is in the movie throughout, and Gibson and the 3 actors who portray his family do a good job. Unfortunately the movie suffers from plot problems and never really reaches its potential. This is a decent evening's entertainment, but no Academy Awards here."
5,It's not an alien movie!!!,"People have criticised this movie because of the aliens and the various plot holes that surround them. Some people don't seem to realise that this isn't an alien film. They just help to carry the message that the movie brings. It's a movie about faith, beliefs and showing how the family deals emotionally with what is happening. It's a movie based around the humans living in the house! They're the stars of the show. Forget the aliens and you'll find the movie does what its supposed to do. And it does it very well. By not seeing the aliens, it builds up a level of tension that can be missing from other supposed alien movies. One of the main reasons the film is so good is the acting. The cast do a great job playing their characters, allowing you to easily relate to them and understand their problems."
1,signs,"I have a collection of Mel Gibson's films and I like them all very much except this 'signs' film. It is by far the worst thing I have seen all year and a rock bottom vote for Gibson. The filming was dark,ugly and unviewable. The audio was by grunt to grunt only. The story line was totally absent. For me it was a total waste of time and I would not recommend this film to anyone."
1,I agree with the Dutch guy,"To assume aliens have managed to traverse the universe yet can't manage to find their way past a wooden door is so insulting to anyone with any intelligence, it ruins the entire viewing experience. As JRR Tolkien said,in fantasy, the world, though a fabrication, has to make sense, has to have an intrinsic rightness. This screenwriter has forgotten that, no doubt pumped up by his past success. He should be ashamed to have produced this garbage with it's inconsistencies which are so far-fetched even those who suspend belief..cant quite believe it."
1,Alien Corn Pone,"'Signs' was a total waste of time. It was liken to watching old 1950's sci-fi flicks like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" except both of these had some redeeming value or atleast substance worth discussion over a beer or two. Gibson was flat as usual....all of his character roles are interchangeable-indistinguishable ;""What Women Want"" is the ""Patriot"" who lives next to a corn field with mowed down""Signs"".Same O-same O.I did wonder however what the reverend-gone farmer [too much] Gibson did with all of the corn raised on his 'farm'? No critters-no silos were evident.And what pray tell was the bat bashing of the paper mache 'alien' by Rivers all about? I suspect it became his ticket back to the minors ."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"I have come to expect much better from Mel Gibson. After Braveheart and Bounty I guess it was only natural that he would have some that did not come up to their quality. Signs was, to me, slow, boring, and too far fetched. The humor was not funny and the acting was not all that good. The female cop should go back to high school plays and leave the profession to the professionals. But, then again, there was nothing professional about this movie. Sorry Mel, I still love you anyway. Sudami"
4,My boyfriend wrote this ... I'm in the shower,"Since I'm signed on with someone else's account, I'll be happy to pen a review. I had no preconceptions of this DVD when I sat down to watch it ... except that I tried to watch ""The Sixth Sense"" twice and never made it even halfway through the movie. I made it all the way through this one, however. It was a witty movie, played well by all the major characters, well cast (except the Indian with the pantry) ... and very tense in all the right places. The plot was WAY too predictable, and the scene one-third through where Mel tells Phoenix about the two kinds of people could have been WAY better written. Very enjoyable movie. I did catch myself looking toward the windows of the house several times throughout. The kids were the exact opposite of the Bundy kids, though - no kids exist ANYWHERE in the world like the kids in this movie - too sappy to be real. The scene where his wife dies is remarkable. Watch it. Today."
1,This movie was very lame.,"This movie was lame. The only good part was when they first showed the alien. Very boring movie. Aliens can travel through space, but cannot open a wooden pantry door? Poorly written."
1,THE ALIEN LOOKS THE SAME AS IN EVER OTHER SCI-FI MOVIE,"Yes there are a couple of scenes which made me jump in my seat, but I expected a more elaborate story. 95 PERCENT OF THE MOVIE OCCURS ON MEL GIBSON'S FARM. And besides a sherrif and an indian guy, you hardly see the rest of the towns people.The part Mel plays does not fit. It should have been given to an older (farmer looking) actor. Unfortunatley, the only reason why you will see this movie is because Mel Gibson's is in it!!!!"
2,Not the movie for Mel,"Trite idea almost executed well, but somehow left me with more disappointment than entertainment. Mel Gibson just wasn't a good choice this time and I think he had to ""under play"" his role; though the role did not seem to offer much room to develop.""Signs"" is certainly a ""sign of the times"" with the current Zeitgeist of Alien visitation, however this film needed more detail and plot."
1,Really stupid,"Crop circles are intriguing, but using this very real fascinating phenomena to make a movie about restoration of faith is simply sad. Why should events be right to save him and not others? Why saving humans and not the aliens? His restored faith makes no sense.The movie was awkward, boring and predictable. As stupid as AI but not quite as long and tedious. I wish I could give it zero stars because it doesn't even deserve 1. I wish someone had warned me not to waste my time."
2,high expectations that lead to a let down,"M Night Shyamalan does a great job of teasing you into believing that his movies are much more interesting than they turn out to be. The Sixth Sense was a great movie full of suspense and the unexpected. The previews for Signs made it seem equally frightening and interesting. Alas, it was not. Mel Gibson's character's crisis of faith was not enough to make the movie worth sitting through. I had to write this review because I saw it had only 3 reviews so far, each giving it 5 stars... and it is definitely NOT a 5 star movie."
2,ok for religious or those who have no knowledge of science,"Its ok as to mel gibson searching for faith (or signs). but the premise is bad, aliens do not develop warpspeed spaceflight technology, come to a 3/4 water planet with their certain weakness, with no technology? and be defeated by a highschool baseball player!"
2,Sign Off,"I didnt get some parts of the film. To many plot holes for my liking. Tho it was nice since it was shot around Berks County so that was the only thing keeping me from totaly trashing it. the acting was ok but it is not fun to sit around thinking to your self ""why would you arm your self with only a flash light, I mean didnt TV teach tou any thing?"""
1,very disappointing,even i had force myself to watch the whole movie as i thought it would improve i was wrong and by the end i was real disappointed. The movie is just plain dull and slow also the plot is not easy to follow.
2,bad signs,"This movie starts really nice when a family living on a farm finds mysterious crop circles in their fields. These same circles start appearing in other places in the world announcing a possible alien invasion.It doesn't take long before you notice that this movie resemble an empty drum.A weak story beginning to end. (and what a bad ending)This movie gets the two stars and not just one, only because of the usual good acting of Mel Gibson. Nothing else is worth mentioning.Although I am big fan of science Fiction movies, my advise here is:Save your Dollars."
3,signs: the review,Signs setting is in Bucks County. Mel Gibson plays the role of a widower who has walked away from being a pastor. His brother lives with him and helps take care of the kids. As the movie progresses strange things start happening.Mel Gibsons role is very important. He is the main character. His attiude and expressions fit his part very well. He was a good choice for the main role. The closeness of the family shows that they care for one another. The unity as a family really brings the story together. It is interesting how the movie is filmed through the life of the family and not the town.The movie was really good. The farm atmosphere helped create the eerieness of the situation. At times the storyline went a little to in depth with details but over all did a good just laying out details and hints. The directors pick of actors was close to perfect. Each actor played their role well. It is definitly worth watching more then once.
2,both thumbs down,"As a horror movie fan, I was greatly disappointed in SIGNS. I went in expecting a scary movie similar to 'The Others' or 'Alien', but I saw neither. What I saw was a movie that uses low-budget horror flick tricks. The alien was suppose to provide the spooks, but it hardly had any screen time. We only saw shadowy figures in the dark, heard loud banging behind closed doors and saw an alien hand or two sticking out from behind a small opening. We don't get to see the alien until the very end. It was that kind of movie. The story seemed to be mainly about Mel Gibson's character having lost his faith, then regaining it. Maybe I wouldn't have been as disappointed if the promotions weren't as misleading."
2,Unimpressed,"This movie consisted of a cookie cutter plot, cheesy/uninspired twists, and overall bad acting. It is better suited to have been a made for tv movie offering ample opportunity to change the channel."
5,It's About Faith,"Signs is a very creative film that is actually about struggling with faith. The whole ""alien invaders"" thing is actually just a creative device (done quite well) to bring the issue of reliance on God to the service. All of the actors in the film were quite good, especially the young boy. It seems the negative reviews are mainly from people who were expecting a sci-fi or horror film. Although there are definitely some creepy moments, that's not actually what the film is about. Its not supposed to be fast-paced. Its a a subtle film that is supposed to make one ponder and very effective as such. I highly reccomend it."
1,"Duh, 70 percent of our planet's surface is WATER!","Stupidest Movie Ever! If you're allergic to water, why do you come here? Okay, maybe you have compelling reason, maybe dirt is gold to them, Okay, SO WEAR A FRIGGIN SPACE SUIT, Right? No, these aliens are running around NAKED. In THE MIDWEST!!! If you've never been there, THE AIR ITSELF is, like, 50 percent WATER!. Most Humid place I've ever been! And they're running around naked! Wish I could rate this zero stars. This is stupid. That is all."
2,2 1/2 stars--cheesy!!!!!!!!,"After the awesome ""Sixth Sense,"" I was expecting another cool flick from Mr M.Night. I have to agree with the first reviewer who said that the dialogue sounded contrived, and the plot was preachy.There were more funny (funny stupid, not funny haha) moments in this movie than scary ones, and I was never ""on the edge of my seat.""The only redeeming things about this movie was the scary-looking alien and the cute little girl. I say skip it and rent ""The Sixth Sense"" instead."
4,Great movie and some good extra features!,The movie was great. When I got a gift card for Christmas one year I knew this was the DVD I wanted to buy. It's one of M Night Shyamalan's best movies (I even think it was better than Sixth Sense).The DVD has an neat bonus footage on it - like a movie made by MNS when he was a kid. It's great to see his vision as a child and how far he has grown. The DVD also has a nice story board to scene feature for certain parts of the movie. It's kinda neat to see how the finished product stacked up against the story boards.However with a movie with this much humor I would have loved to seen some bloopers or outtakes. But then again I say that about every movie.
3,Flawed ...,"There are a ton of elements in the film-making process that M Night seems to be extremely gifted in. Camera-work, generating atmosphere, lighting, set design, he's outstanding with; maybe the best since Hitchcock (as some people have implied). Unfortunately for 'Signs', concise story-telling dosen't seem to be one of them.There are a couple of real issues with the plot of this movie that needed to be addressed before this movie was released. For example, the ending was similar to 'War of the Worlds', but the hook dosen't make any sense. Why would aliens with a certain weakness want to invade a planet covered by so much of it? At one point a stat is given about Joaquin Phoenix's home run record. Does anybody appreciate how far that home run would be? It would be the longest in history. I don't care how many times the guy struck out. Barry Bonds strikes out all the time, he's still in the majors.It was little points like this that were just killing the experience for me ...."
5,EXCELLENT,"This just might be one the most well-crafted movies of all time. In an age when gratuitous violence and excessive blood and gore dominate the movies, Shyamalan's attention to detail builds suspense by using the audience' imagination against them. There is no waste in this movie. Every scene, each bit of dialogue has a point. An excellent example of the 'less is more' philosophy. Its a different role for Gibson, but he and the rest of the cast are absolutely up to the task. Signs made me think of the old ""War of the Worlds"" radio broadcast. It's really more about how one family deals with what is happening around them. One of the most engrossing movies I've seen in a long time. I can't say enough good about it."
4,M. Kinght's Still Got It,"I saw this with my brother-in-law, 'the doctor'.We certainly didn't think we would be frightened by some piddling PG-13 movie.I'm glad to say we were wrong.'Signs', the story of how one family deals with the horrors of a hostile alien invasion in rural Pennsylvania, is not a technically opulent film. It's more of an extended 'Twilight Zone' episode - but a very good one. What you don't know for sure is scarier than what you know. You're hiding behind closed doors, but the further along the invasion progresses the more you know those doors won't hold long. You think it might be something else, or that the director is trying to trick you, but in the end the trick is that it's exactly what it appears to be.Sure the ending's a little hard to swallow, but it's forgivable when taken with the whole of the film.Good acting, nice cinematography, and minimal soundtrack make for good creeps. Denfinatly worth a rental, even if you've seen it already."
3,Signs,Ok.....Signs.....well the storyline sounded promising on the previews...but when I watched the movie...I guess it really didn't do it for me....The only truly creepy part is the end the rest I constantly laughed my head of because it was so stupid....I mean It was so predictable...I knew from the beginning that the gurl and her water would play a major role...and it did.....I donno if you life sciece fiction...alien stuff this might be for you...but otherwise don't watch it
1,Too bad I can't give it ZERO stars.,"Stinks big time. Aliens that can make huge crop circles, but unable to break a single wooden door? Faith lost-and-found? Give me a break! Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs, the trailer is MUCH better than the movie itself and all so-callled ""critics' praises"" are huge lies."
1,NoT Worthy even to be seen.,....... MaY be if some one tells you the story with out you watching the movie..u'd like it and u'd be interested..but watching the movie...makes u feel..that the plot misses alot..i know that movie isn't about aliens and the usual sci-fi..i just think it was a movie that have a good idea but it missed lot's of unity..plus the overacting preformance of Mel Gibson is distracting..i never felt that Mel gibson is a good actor any way....
1,Hotch Potch,"Not since ""Sixth Sense"", with the most obvious and telegraphed twist, have I seen a bigger load of hooey. This guys inability to tell a story without glaringly obvious chasms in the plot is only equalled by his obviously tenuous grasp of Christian theology and doctrine.. a bit like an O'level pupil writing a thesis on nuclear fission. The mere concept of this plot, using an alien invasion as proof of Gods existence, flys in the face of the most fundamental of christian tenets.. Crikey, and all this from an agnostic.."
1,Hated It!!!!!!!,"I don't know if I'm the only one who has given this movie only 1 star but to me, that's all it deserves!! Of course, what can you expect from creepy M. Night Shyamalan. Although he did a much better job with The Village which still isn't saying too much. Come on Mel Gibson, you can play in much better movies than this! I'll never understand how people can call this movie scary! I was bored to death with this movie. You think a good suspensful movie awaits you with the crop circles and all but... wrong. Crop circles suddenly start appearing on a farm owned by Gibson's character. Ok, you see a few aliens but nothing scary about them at all. What a letdown of a movie. I bought it for cheap before having seen it and I ended up giving the movie away. If you want a boring movie and a letdown, I'd strongly suggest this one!"
1,total pos family mindless crap,This movie is mindless mass market soccer mom crap.nothing is interestingboring crap lame ending
1,A thriller Movie but without thrille!,"How a great actor like Mel Gipson accepts a role in this awful movie.The film stars are five -Mel Gibson and his family-, or let me say the film cast because they are almost the only actors since the film's beginning to its end.At the beginning of the film, you will see Mel Gibson's children from the early morning, staring at the cultivated circles! what makes young children wake up in the early morning, staring at cultivated circles?And frankly I could not stand completing it to the end, so after the first 25 minute I skipped to the middle then to the end.I am sure If there is a competition for worst films, ""Signs"" will take the first place, and ""The Blair Witch Project "" will take the second place."
5,"Great finish to the ""trilogy"", Sixth Sense/Unbreakable/Signs","There is apparently more to M. Night Shyamalan than you would guess from seeing him in the ""making of"" documentary included with this DVD (though he IS unexpectedly good in his acting role in the movie itself). He's a screenwriter who appears to have flunked grade school english grammer (""these kind""), but as a director and filmmaker, he has a very elegant visual style, and discipline and craftsmanship Hitchcock would admire. ""Signs"" is remarkable filmmaking, very intelligent and restrained. My guess is that most of the negative reactions you will see on these pages will come from sixteen-year-olds on an ""Armageddon"" intravenous drip."
4,"Very Good, But......","Not excellent, and i'll tell you why. Signs was one of the best movies of the summer of 2002 that's almost a fact, i found myself very intrigued, and into the story, i never took my eyes off the screen. I am a huge scary movie fanatic, and this movie made me jump and scream several times, all elements of this move were very good, and the camera work was excellent. Mr. Mel Gibson gives another outstanding perfermance like i expected as well as his supporting cast. And for once in a movie the adults believed the kids, that are always right. But when i was done watching Signs i felt like something was missing, that it shouldn't have ended the way it did, that's why i didn't give it 5 stars, i defitnitly recommend seeing this flick, and if your a dvd collector you probably already own, everyone must see it."
3,DVD Blues,"I liked the movie very much, but was disappointed in the DVD. I didn't like the storyboard captions. It took away from watching the movie. I would have liked it if it was just the movie. Very disappointed in this version."
5,Very subtle in places,"Okay, so it's not a Stephen King classic, but this movie left me with hope for mankind. Sort of a lofty review for such a simple movie I know, but if you watch it for entertainment value you can pick up on some very subtle plot twists. Why did his daughter have a thing for leaving water glasses around? Why did the alien invasion have anything to do with Mel Gibson's charcter's waning faith? I thought it was a great movie and the humor injected into the spooky parts was very entertaining. Don't expect an epic film, but it is worth watching. I'd recommend it."
2,"Cure for insomnia, rent or buy Signs, you'll soon be snoring","Mel Gibson, the magic word, it must be an entertaining film, he always gives value for money, not this time.We have a field with corn circles, a farmers house, and a few extra scenes to pad the time out. The farmers's house of course has a basement, and the living quarters are decorated like a funeral parlor and there is an awful lot of talking and no action.OK for home entertainment where the fridge is close by and a nice broken-in sofa.Thoroughly disappointing, waste of gas money, waste of ticket money, and a thorough waste of time."
1,Glad I didn't pay box office prices!!,"Since when did ministers or preachers wear the collar of a Catholic Priest? And if Mel was meant to be a catholic priest, since when did Catholic Priests have wifes and kids?..I wouldn't have thought much about this detail but they kept refering to him as ""Father"". One other oversite is...If I were going to board a door shut I would do it from the side that the door opens...not the other side. Come on guys...do you think we would be so interested in this rather slow and uneventfull film that we wouldn't notice these obvious oversites? Mel must have been paid very well to agree to this flick because I have never seen him in anything but great stuff...Well except maybe ""Air America"" and I would pick that one over ""Signs"" any day.p.s. can I get a refund on my rental cost???!!!RJT"
1,Super Boring!!!,"i love suspense, thriller, etc. movies but this movie just wasted our time. it was super boring which ended us saying....""that's it?!"". please, please, there are lots of perfect, thrilling movies out there....way a lot better than this. ""Signs"" does not really desserve a star in the first place."
4,You Must Pay Attention,This movie requires the viewer to pay close attention and listen carefully to the dialog. Much of the movie's suspense comes from what the actors are saying. The camera work adds to the viewer's uneasy feelings. Watch for scenes where not all of the shot's prime subjects are completely in the frame. It is very deliberate and adds to the mood of the film.Many people were disappointed with this film in comaparison to The Sixth Sense but I believe it is because they did not pay attention to all of the subtleties of this movie.
3,Yep,"I didn't see this movie until it was released on video. Based on some of my friends opinions: some enjoyed it, some hated it, and some were nuteral. I thougt the movie was better than most said it was. Although it was kind of dissapointing because it built up all this suspense for a simple solution. I loved the young girl. She was cute and amusing. I guess if it is your first time seeing it, it could be quite suspensful. But don't be on the edge of your seat, it could be for nothing."
2,Signs,"This is movie in search of a plot. While I am big fan of Mel Gibson,I think is is by far the worse movie he has ever done. It is campy andpoorly executed. Don't waste your time or money on this movie."
1,SIGN? I'LL GIVE YOU A SIGN! STOP!,"Stop! Don't waste your money! The reviewers must have been paid off., This script is beyond bad. I can't believe how insipid it is. People in this movie said things and acted like aliens themselves,in that it was so unatural and forced. And for not delivering. If you did not like this movie-don't feel like you are the alien. It's the reviewers-they obviously have taken over and are promoting movies that star their relatives! Yuck Yuck Yuck! This movie is an insult to all thinking people."
4,Excellent Blu-Ray Transfer,"This review is for the blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.The blu-ray version of Signs is excellent. Outdoor scenes have sharp detail, true-to-life color and virtually no film grain. The picture is so realistic that you feel like you are standing next to the characters in the scene. Indoor shots are not quite as crisp, but still very good. The contrast is strong in dark scenes, with deep blacks--and that matters in this movie, which has several scary night scenes.The sound is superb. The Hitchcock-type soundtrack sounds great, and scary noises really pop.In short, this is one of the best blu-ray transfers I have seen. Even though there is not much in the way of action or scenic vistas, it is still worth upgrading from DVD. My four-star rating is for the movie; I would rate the transfer as five stars."
5,Terrific Movie!,"I thought this movie was great! It was a thilling movie with actually funny comedy, not the usual cheesieness. Shamalayn did a great job keeping the suspense without ever really seeing what was terriorising Earth. It reminded me of getting scared with all my friends as a kid over something one of us thought we saw out of the corner of our eyes. The kids were absoultly hilarious! It got even funnier when the adults started to get caught up in all the alien stuff with the kids. I saw it 3 times in the theater and have it on reserve for when it comes out on dvd. I would defiently recommend this movie. It was a nice change of pace from the typical alien movies where the only way get rid of them is to blow 'em up."
1,"Not good, dont be fooled by fans of M. Night.","This movie is not good. Don't be fooled by the other reviews. The first half is ok but as soon as these ridiculous looking aliens show up, the whole plot goes down the tubes. I can't understand why people are so into this movie. The Sixth Sense was fantastic, this doesnt come close and of course at the end of this movie M. Night Shayamalan tries to bring everything together and blow you away, but honestly its just not interesting. This was probablly the biggest waste of time of a movie I have ever seen."
2,Almost fell asleep,I found Signs to be too slow and boring. The ending was okay but certainly did not make up for the painstaking process it took to get there.
3,"Premise OK, but needs a rewrite","This film has a few good touches here and there that indicate the intelligence of the filmmaker. Storey seems like he saw and combined Hitchcock's ""The Birds"", with a preacher who has lost his faith angle, also with a very scaled down ""Independence Day"". Let's see, an alien can travel accross space, but can't figure out how to open a door...several times!! Plus he stands like a statue while repeatedly getting hit with a bat. Some enjoyable suspense early on, but the payoff is weak."
4,Great for Kids,I got this for my niece who is just starting out to enjoy cooking. I felt it was just her level to experiment with.
5,Made a great gift,I gave this as a christmas gift to my great niece who is 10. She has really enjoyed the junior cookbook.
4,good merchandise,The book was received in a timeley manner. It was in good shape as described. Would do business with seller again when need arises.
2,Wasn't what I was looking for,"I am having WLS myself, and was looking for a book that was informative about the surgery and process. I found Carnie's book was more of a life-journal, rambling, and it was hard for me to follow along, I kept waiting for the ""guts"" of the story. I was also disappointed with the frequent use of the ""f"" word, feeling that it wasn't as necessary to the story. Overall it was an allright book, I just found other books to help me in my own journey."
2,I thank God for my parents,"Wow - I don't even know where to begin with this book. I bought it because Carnie is an intriguing character - and no disprespect at all - but she was the heavy girl with two beautiful girls. I was curious to her life and her surgery.Well, what a vulger read we had here. Aside from the expletives everywhere - we learn she lost her virginity at 13 or some too young age - at a parent sanctioned sleep over with her boyfriend. That falls under way too much information.Carnie has a beautiful voice and she mentions quite often she didn't get the respect she deserved. We get it. Quit whining.But the coup de gras was what she whispered to her surgeon prior to him slicing her open. I'll save that for you to read for yourself.Bad."
3,"Exact book, slow recieving time","The book was brand new, but it took an extra week to recieve it. Which was a incovince for me."
3,Allyn Bacon Guide to writing fifth edition mycomplab,"I looked everywhere for Allyn and Bacon Guide to Writing Mycomplab. I thought I found it here on Amazon, but when I got the book it had no complab. Someone told me that they don't have the rights to sell the complab. I believe they should disclose that information.If they did I didn't see it. I am alittle irritated and alot of people from my class ran into the same situation as I. I gave it three stars because the service was quick and the book is new and in great shape. However, know that you are not getting mycomplab. You may still buy the book and purchase mycomplab on its own as I will have to. It will cost another 25 dollars."
4,Great!,"I vaguely remember hearing of The Rasmus before I saw the video for In The Shadows. At first, I thought the lead singer was a girl. What can I say, he looks feminine with all that eyeliner and a higher pitched singing voice.In any case, even though I had heard the song probably around 15 times on that 16th time I decided to buy the album. Ive found that I actually like all of the songs on the CD, which is a first for me, because theres almost always a song that I will skip over. My personal favourites are The One I Love and F-F-F-Falling, even though it's originally off of Into. I also like First Day of My Life.What makes The Rasmus so incredible would have to be the fact that Lauri can pull off singing in English. His accent makes them a bit more unique, and the occasional hints of synthesizers in the songs add to just how different this band really is.They've been around for 10 years, and let's just say I wish I would've heard of them sooner."
2,How about a Hanson vs. Rasmus celebrity deathmatch?,"I bought this CD hoping to hear something better than the sticky lead single, but I was disappointed past the fourth track. Not only the lyrics disolve rapidly into a monotonous conglomerate of mindless thoughts, but even the promising riffs and drum base from ""In the shadows"" are forgotten, or abused in other cases. Even the artwork is poor (check out the note on the insert)and has kept me wondering for hours if whoever designed it had the nerve to charge these kids for the job.It is certainly a pity that we get to hear one hit wonders over and over again. Unless Rasmus grow musically, not just their clothes size, they are destined to be one more of the bunch."
3,"Good, but needs some work","This definately has album has its ups and downs.The unique vocals are almost flawless, and haunting tunes will definately catch your ear. However, the lyrics are far from original and as you advance through the album the songs start to sound repetitive. The one issue that bothers me is the fact that The Rasmus relied on a few hit songs to sell the whole cd.Overall, this cd is a good buy for $10...let's just hope their next album will top this one."
3,"Kinda lame, but I like it","I bought the cd because I heard ""in the shadows"" and ""guilty"". They are both amazing songs, but the cd falls short too much to be enjoyable. Only 10 songs, and about 4 of them suck. Sorry Rasmus, not good enough for me. It does seem like they have the potential though. Maybe they will be smart and use their next cd to show they can improve.P.S. I recently heard a bonus track on this cd called ""F-F-F-Falling"" and it is the worst thing I've ever heard. It sounds like the Backstreet Boys and simple plan got in a car crash. ITS A GOOD THING THIS SONG WAS CUT FROM THE CD. Don't pay more money for the version with this bonus track, it is horrible."
3,Are you talking to me?,"Have to give a total thumbs up on the new release, but find it disappointing the Fosselius released the tape without the other 3 trailers. I was lucky to have run across this relic in a dying video store. Makes me miss the old days of Cinemax's video shorts. Long live the Farce!"
3,Meh.,"The best way to prepare for law school exams is to practice. This book might be good for helping you get into the mindset the week before classes, but relaxing on the beach might do you more good. Trust me, the school will make sure you get the message on how to write a law school exam answer. If you're uncertain, just ask the professor. Plus, some want you to explore every possibility and others will want you to choose the best path and stick to it. If you really want to go nuts and prepare for law school, go with Planet Law School. It's more comprehensive and will better prepare you for the overall experience."
5,Great Intro to the study of law,"I read this book in preparation for starting law school in the fall of 2006. I found this more helpful than any of the law school prep books that I have read (law school confidential, law school insider) for understanding what the learning process of law is like. It will be interesting to see how what the book says compares with my experience next year, but I feel much more confident that I can approach the material in a more appropriate manner than I might have without this book.The practical advice on how to read exam questions and write exam responses and frame answers also looks like it will be very helpful."
5,Game Changer,"This is the first law school study aid that has made sense of the vast material being studied, along with a road map to successfully using this knowledge to answer essay questions. It's a construct. It maps patterns in questions and answers. I struggled with ""IRAC"" -- which seemed too simplistic, never seemed to fit, and didn't afford the kind of depth of thinking and analysis graders expect to see, or that a future client would expect to hear! This truly is the book I've been looking for. Read 140 pages in first sitting, and expect to read and re-read many times. Restored my confidence in the pursuit of a law degree. Highly recommended!"
4,Getting to Maybe,"The book was in the condition I expected it to be in, therefore I am satisfied with my purchase."
1,bad one,For some reason this part did not work . I had a machanic put the part on and the oil pressure gauge still did not work . This was to simple a repair to put on improperly.
1,Not healthy,"This product should be described clearly at the front of the package (not the inside after it is revealed)that it contains partially hydrogenated oil. Also, I feel that it should not be in the ""organic & natural"" section of Amazon's grocery."
5,Here's to Circus,"Forget Usual Suspects, forget Guy Ritchie or Pulp-Fictionesque movies. CIRCUS outweighs films like Confidence or other con/affair-like plots. Mind-entertaining, spectacular, interesting, hard-to-crack. Worth if you like to use to solve riddles, if you're a bit sick of sour as two-week milk american con-movies. Thumbs up! Hannah, Izzard and Jannsen do it!"
2,I dont get it,What i really dont get is why are these two con-people doubble crossing so many people when they could achive the same goal by just doubble crossing Brian Conally. In fact they could have just stolen his money seeing they both worked for him?!?!?!?
5,Beautiful Alaska.....,"Great documentary, a little short but worth the price. The rendering on my TV (Panasonic 42"", 1080p) is absolutely amazing. If you like these type on documentaries you might want to look at Planet Earth. I also own it and it is an amazing documentary, a bit pricier than this one but well worth it. If you like Alaska, you are on a budget and want to see how a blue ray DVD looks on your TV, buy this DVD."
2,"Well, This Certainly Isn't What I Expected","When my friends down at the town water fountain told me aboutt this new-fangled contraption, I was beside myself. Finally, my wife and kids could be clean along with myself! But oh, was I in for a shock. For one thing, the design of this thing is very backward. I mean, I'm quite a manly Blue Jay, and I have much trouble keeping my balance on it. It's actually quite flimsy, and you can kind of see that from the picture. Added to that, my wife and I fit just fine on it, but our kids have to stay in the nest, and with all those cats snooping around, that's never a good idea. Oh well, I guess that's why God gave us that wonderful Peritonitis! Conversely, there are some good things about this bath. It's very new age-ish. And the interestingly shaped support is great for my completely random desires to sharpen my beak or cause a general ruckus around the neighborhood. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll now head back to spreading disease among helpless children!"
1,Extreamly Disapointed,"I bought this DVD player a year ago. It worked fine at first and then about 4months after having it, I would put a movie in and all I would hear was a clicking noise and then it would tell me there was no disc in there. I am very dissatisfied with this brand and I will never buy an APEX product again. I had bought DVD players for my family members and none of them are APEX. I have told everyone I know never to buy APEX and so far none of them have had a problem with there Panosonic, and Sony DVD players."
1,Beastly,"I can't believe Apex is getting away with selling these horrible machines! They work well for a few months to a year, and then--- it won't play anything you put into it, it simply says ""no disc""; or if a disc plays at all, it freezes and skips like mad. In my opinion, this dvd player should be taken off the market. Both my mom and I have had the same experience with our Apex dvd players. I definitely do *not* recommend buying an apex if you still want a working machine in a year."
1,....,"Dont buy this dvd player - I've had nothing but headaches. First of all, it doesn't recognize the dvd half the time. Then, half way thru the movie, it will freeze and not respond to anything but turning it off - all on perfect brand new discs. And every dvd with a somewhat complex menu - forget about it!! It will freeze when you hit enter on a menu with more than 2 or 3 things. Add to that stutter skips, ejecting a still turning disc(scratching the hell out of it) and sometimes choppy playback(again, all on perfectly new dvds) and this dvd player is NOT WORTH THE HEADACHES! Pay the extra 50 bucks for a name brand - its worth it in the end!"
1,Worked well for about 2 months.,"Wanna know why this product is so cheap? Because it won't work in a couple of months. I just went to watch a movie, and the picture is in black and white ONLY. NO COLOR. I called Apex, and they agreed that it was defective, and now want ME to pay the shipping + handling, in order to send it to them. Apex is going in the trash can, and now I'm off to buy a REAL player."
4,Good deal for the $,"I've only had the unit for a little while, but it works as advertised. To all of the people writing negative reviews, keep in mind that this thing is $! You get what you pay for most of the time. This is no different. I use mine in my office and not as my primary DVD player. My motto: Don't pay much, don't get much, don't expect much."
4,More than I Expected!!!!,My book arrived before tbe estimated time of arrival and it was in better condition than I imagined.I am a first time buyer @ Amazon .com and I love it!! I will probably buy most of my items thru Amazon because my book was more than I expected!!!!
2,Older than looks,"Product detail say ... ""Publisher: Ayer Co Pub (April 1976)"", but that edition is a reprint. It was published at 1950."
5,Exquisite,"The most beautiful film I have ever seen. Incredible framing, wonderful acting and filmmaking, universal story, breathtaking vistas, great soundtrack. Don't miss it! Can't wait until it is released on tape/DVD. I must have a copy whatever the price!"
2,Needs Work,"I consider my self an expert fighting game player, having played many generations of many different games. Although I like the look of the game, and the graphics were a great improvement. the game play was way to difficult for most players. In fact I feelthat the fighting engine is the biggest drawback in the game. Moves and combos are to difficult the execute. An engine with a simpler input interface like any of the Tekken games would have served this game well."
4,A WELL OILED MACHINE,Simply excelent great graphics well thought out combat system and best of all no button mashing fighting game fan know what i mean you kid brother can just pick up the controller for the frist time and kick your butt this game is very technical it takes timing and skill to be a master not to mention the great amount moves for every charter if your a fan of DOA or Bloody roar you will not like this game. If you plan on buying it clear you schdule because its gonna take up you time learning this one if your a fighting game fan i would recommend this game its a classic.
3,roller,"This works well, but I thought that is would be a softer roller. My mistake, but I still use it."
4,My Word.......,"I found the book very entertaining. It amazes me that there are so many negative individuals out there who simply can't reward someone for having an ingenious/creative idea. From reading some of these reviews I can see that random acts of kindness are not everyone's forte' (does it matter if you gave to a homeless person, to karyn or to a more worhtwhile cause) I can only speak for myself...but when I give (regardless of where) I do it from my heart. This women didn't set out to hurt anyone, she asked and she received...ummm, now didn't someone we all know and love (well at least me) tell us to do exactly that. You go girl....And hey, to everyone else...give it a rest on the the literary critique, it's a lite read, view it as such."
4,Better than I thought it would be...,"Really! I bought this book thinking it would be nothing more than 'mindless chicklit', expecting it to serve its purpose as a time-waster on a cross-country flight, and nothing more... But guess what? I really liked it! And it really made me think about my own shopping habits and (gasp!) credit card debt... In fact, within 30 minutes of arriving home from my trip, I immediately began listing some of my own extravegant purchases on ebay, a'la Save Karyn..."
5,A great read,This is a very funny book that is easy to read and hard to put down. I couldn't wait to see how Karyn was going to get herself out of trouble next! Very addictive!!!!
5,power where you are,the ones I found in the world were too short and too expensive. found this one and problem solved. it reaches across the room.
2,YOU WANT EDIT OR NOT?,"I'll keep this short , i agree it a good book, but it been edited, so parts were cut out, for ex if you see inferno, it around 190 pages in this book, but other it ranges from 430 pages. I don't believe they could fit 400 pages of text in 191 pages.If you want to read the COMPELTE Divine Comedy without editing don't read this book. For me I think this book is too small to fit all 3 Comedys and include Vita Nuova."
1,Terrible Kindle Edition,"This review refers only to the Kindle edition of this book.The Kindle version is almost unreadable. No separation of any kind is made between the verses and the footnotes, and it is thus almost impossible to read. Every other paragraph is a footnote. It is as though you are sitting in a room listening to two people simultaneously reading aloud from different books.I'm thoroughly disappointed in Amazon for selling this mess."
1,Bad product,"Stay clear at all costs. Lots of bad stuff written about this media. Pity I didn't heed the advice. Bought two 5-packs a few years ago. My CD Writing program told me they were made by InfoDisc. Slowly but surely, one by one, the discs failed to be recognized as CDRW's by several CR Writers. Of course this means that they have been ""demoted"" to ... CD-R's, and from what I read, quite bad ones when it comes to data integrity. Two years on from my purchase, NONE of the 10 discs can be used as CD-RW's anymore. Shame on you Memorex."
3,"no spec or actual name , it is the plunger. 2"" valves or larger.","no spec or actual name , it is the plunger. 2"" valves or larger.no mfg part number either.for import heads.VLV-50 3/4 (19.1mm) to 1-1/4 valve.s"
3,Not for research,"It seems that the real story about Washington is what happened to his writings (they were scattered and butchered), and this work is ok for an overview but if you are seeking something specific: forget it, find another source that is more comprehensive."
4,Works great for Small Parrots,Upgraded them from the transport cage and they fell in love with it. When letting them out the play around but always go back to sit on the cage. The included accessories are a bonus.
2,Dreaded HO Failure,Loved this player until 14 months when HO code came on and it needed a new laser for $150......
1,And another H07,"Once again, another problem with this DVD player. 12 months and 2 days after purchase, it just halted. I am happy to have found these other comments before I spent another pointless 30 minutes on hold waiting for Panasonic Customer Service to never answer..."
1,H07? Call Panasonic,"If you still have a unit that has experienced the H07 death message, call Panasonic Executive Customer Relations at 201-392-6870. Politely but firmly ask them what they are doing about this widespread problem, and tell them you would like them to fix your unit at no charge."
1,OK until HO7 hit,This is the second Panasonic DVD player I've had which suddenly died for no reason at about a year old. No more Panasonics for me.
3,good for a year,"DVD Player is about a year and a half old. It was fine until about 2 months ago, when it started to skip. I tried a cleaner and it didn't work. Every disc skips especially bad at the begining and in the menu."
5,a great buy,"I have been happy with this DVD player for well over a year now. I have read the other reviews and must admit that I cannot add much more than already has been said, but I'd like to contribute a little in the area of longevity for the product. I purchased this last year in April and the manufacturing date on mine is for 2002 of that year. I have been playing DVD's like mad (this is my first player--a big step up from VHS!) and I have not encountered any problems at all. As one reviewer has already mentioned: the display on the player is very nice. It gives out the chapter you are on as well as the time. The ""on the fly"" options you can execute are very nice. The player reads mp3s, cd-r(w)'s, wma, etc., very well and shows them in an on-screen tree type format. The only downside is the remote--with the buttons being small and having no backlight. This is a great buy for a very awesome price. It has suited my every need and has given me great service for over a year of hard play."
5,Good item but didn't get it at amazon,"I didn't get the gift box labeled here. I ordered it originally, but the seller was out of stock and being so close to Christmas (it was a gift) I had to run to a local Bed Bath and Beyond to find the same knife. The knife itself is great for cutting things like hard veggies (carrots particularly). The shorter blade is perfect for stability on veggies."
4,"great knife, but what about warranty?","My wife and I loved this knife, until today. Today my wife felt well enough to cook and this is her absolute favorite knife due to weight and balance. She has bad arthritis and her hands often cannot use most knives. Today it flew thru dicing onions, celery, and bell peppers. Then she had to stir the chili and asked me to smash the cloves of garlic with the side of the knife. It snapped in half on the first smash! I could not find my receipt and cannot find the warranty, even online."
4,My little one loves this,"This cd is a bit annoying; however, my little one loves it. If she's crying, it immediately calms her. Its pretty amazing."
1,A terrible piece of opportunism,I found this 'special' completely sickening.It's a cheaply produced sensationalized account or 2 privelaged people that the producers of this short obviously had no contact with.It seems to be assembled from tabloid stories and heresay.
2,Adaptor Ring,"The adaptor ring is basically a metallic cylinder with machined threads at each end. In quantity, material and labor are probably less than $1.00. With S&H;, the thing cost about $28. While I understand that slow moving items have inventory costs, etc., etc. , it still irks me to pay ""avoided cost"" rather than ""actual cost with a reasonable profit"".Other than being gouged on price, the product works perfectly."
2,Smells like terrible perfume,"I gave it 2 stars, because it cleans and feels fine, but it smells so horrible I had to soak my hands in baking soda and vinegar for 20 minutes to even diminish the odor. It said LEMON! VERBENA! WHICH I LOVE! But it smells like some kind of vomit mixed with flowery perfume from some place cheap and bad. Seriously, it is one of the worst smelling soaps I have ever encountered.I hope they change the fragrance."
1,nasty lavender scent!,we ordered the lavender and it was horrible! it smelled so awful!!! it wouldn't even come off my hands after washing them with a different soup!!!! ewwww.
3,Sodium Laureth Sulfate?,"I noticed this soap in my supermarket. It did not contain Sodium Laureth Sulfate, but the product description here says it does. Can anyone who has purchased this from Amazon confirm if it does contain Sodium Laureth Sulfate?"
2,Mrs. Meyers Needs to Tone things down,"This gets 2 stars because its soap and it works like soap- it gets my hands clean.In the mean time, though, it smells awful. The scent is sooooo overpowering that my husband and I pretty much hate it. We have the Lavender scented soap and it is just bad. It almost has a sort of metallic tangy smell to it- not like any lavender I've ever met."
2,"Lovely fragrance, SUPER drying!","I really wish I could love Mrs. Meyer's body products. I think they smell amazing, but good grief, my skin has never been so dry than when using these products. I have tried the hand soap in Basil, Parsley and Lavender - all smell great, all leave my hands literally cracking and peeling from dryness. I have also tried the bar soap for use in the shower - same thing - Smells great, leaves my skin ashy, white and flaky. I don't have sensitive skin either, it's just something in these products that strip my skin down to nothing. Maybe you'll have better luck, but I don't recommend this product to anyone with dry or sensitive skin."
3,Not nearly as good as the first one,"The first ""Untold Story"" is probably my favorite category 3 movie that I have seen. Despite its depravity, it has a sense of fun to it. This is just a so-so slasher flick. It did not keep my attention.I bought it because it was cheap and because I liked the first one. Do not make the same mistake I did."
3,"Zany, crazy and foul-mouthed fun","Joe Lansdale is definitely not for the easily offended. He manages to offend women, cops, gay men, bears, dogs and more all within the first few pages. If you can laugh with him you'll probably enjoy his colorful writing. If not, you probably won't want to read on.Hap is an everyman sort of guy while Leonard is a big, tough gay man. The two are unlikely buds. After Hap sets aflame the neighboring crack house the duo land in the slammer but the Police Lt. agrees to forgive them if they'll find his missing girlfriend who is also Hap's ex. These books are so madcap and fast paced that they are nearly impossible to summarize. They are also very violent and this one here is no exception.The Two-Bear Mambo wasn't my favorite Lansdale novel and began to lose me towards its middle when there seemed to be one violent run-in with rednecks after another. Even the murder mystery and the offensive (but often funny) bits of dialogue couldn't keep my attention from waning."
4,A Very Cute Movie!,"I watched this cartoon movie The Brave Little Toaster and I really liked it! It seemed to be very original and I just thought it was a really cute movie and I highly recommend it for people of all ages! I have read some reviews from people saying that the idea of inanimate objects coming to life, like a toaster, blender, etc, was scary and I have to say I didn't think it was scary but I guess this movie wouldn't be ideal for someone who scares easily."
5,A Favorite...,"When my son was little, I actually took him to the movie theater to see this! He was 6 years old then, he's now 32 and has two little girls of his own. I purchased this so I could sit and watch it with them at their house, (I have the VHS version, a ""dinosaur""; and yes, I still own a VCR...the one on which I still play the tape when my granddaughter is over). The 3 yr old loves it and considers the vacuum ""the daddy"" of the group! We've watched it several times and her little sister will when she gets older. It's a wonderful movie for kids, and adults can relate to a lot of the dialog (one appliance is an old radio (with an antenna) and he broadcasts WWII era music & sounds). It may seem ""corny"" to some, but still a good animated kids movie, and a great memory of mine. I would definitely recommend this!"
4,"adorable, unique kids flick","When I was a teen and babysat my neighbors, they insisted I watch The Brave Little Toaster. I thought it was going to be the stupidest movie ever. The title just sounded bizarre and pathetic. Well, I wound up loving it. I introduced it to a couple other little kids and they adored it. It is a very creative, unique story about a group of appliances who are left behind when their owners move into an apartment and their son goes away to college. The appliances go on an exciting journey to find their ""master"". I think John Lovitz does the voice of the radio.The toaster and the blanket are especially cute. I think this film is ok for any child. There is nothing truly scary. It is so sweet and innocent. I wish there were more well written, innocent films like this for kids to watch. The Brave Little Toaster is a great gift idea for kids 3-7."
4,classic,"This is a really cute kids' film about talking objects and what could happen with them as time goes on (the family that owns them gets older, the kids grow up, they move, etc etc. The title captures what the movie is about, really. If you like animated films, you definitely should like this."
5,Remembering the childhood,I remembered this movie from when i was a little bitty girl. it crossed my mind one day so i looked it up on amazon. They had it for 8 dollars which i thought was pretty reasonable for a movie not usually found and it was on DVD format. It came through the mail very quickly. I still love the movie as much now as i did when i was little. LOVE LOVE LOVE it.
2,"Quite a change from ""Cold Shoulder"".","I really enjoyed the characters, plotting, and writing in ""Cold Shoulder"". ""Cold Blood"" is as different as night from day. Why wasn't it edited down to half the length? The writing wasn't remarkable, either. I'm not acquainted with New Orleans, so I can't comment on the locale.And Lorraine's battle with the bottle was tiresome to read about."
4,Hope it's a series,"I took this book on a trip to visit the family and kept wanting to get away from them and back to the book. (Don't tell.) The murder is pretty strange and the investigator screwed up in even more interesting ways. There's some fun stuff about Hollywood that rings true, and the bad guy caught me by surprise. Good stuff. More please."
1,Not helpful,"I bought this book to help me sort through my parents and grandparents glassware that I inherited. Out of 10 boxes of glassware, only ONE item was in this book. I guess I should have read the description better - it is just for one brand of glassware, and I have many to sort through."
1,I've given up on Miller,"I bought a whole pile of Miller's books after reading The Duke's Dilemma (a wonderful book, by the way). But I don't know what's happened to her - is this the same person, or someone else writing under the same name? The last three books I read - and I kept reading, in the hope that the next one would get better - have been dire.This one may be marginally better than A Touch of Magic, but as the other reviewer has noted, it's built on a false premise.Clearly Nadine Miller has a lot of fans; well, I'm no longer one of them and won't be reading any more of her books."
2,Not bad,album was alright...not worth buying in the stores though...one of those you can listen to when you're in the mood...good swing to guitar based tech house though...hopefully it will give other greates some ideas for remixes :))
3,"I read it twice, and it has some unique scientific insights...","Stephen Hawking does a good job in this book expressing his theories in an easy to understand fashion, rather than filling the pages with complicated math or writing in an esoteric style meant for other physicists. There are many thoughts that Hawking shares with the reader that will inevitably stick with you. Hawking's insights on time and space are intriguing, he sheds light on Einstein's theory of relativity, and compares that to a more unlikely view of an ""absolute time."" Hawking also talks a great deal about Black Holes, how we know they exist, and how the laws of physics are perhaps greatly altered inside of them. The book is easy to understand, and you won't have to reread paragraphs to comprehend them, that is what makes this a good read for people who aren't astronomers or physicists."
1,what a disappointment,"this book is exclusively for physics students and that should have been made clear in the recommendations. I read it half way through and could not finished, for the first time in my life. I read each page three times, and at the middle I tried to review what I learned, and I realized I did not have a clue of what the book is all about. Certainly is not about the ""hitory of time"". Waiste of money and, more important, a huge waste of my time."
1,"If like you like to sit around and get bored, read this!",Before I read this book my views on thermo-dynamics was clouded by bordom and the fact that I have things that arn't boring to do. They are still the same now. This book was so boring and droning that I thought I had slipped into a coma.
3,Audio Book Reader Ruins Hawking's Great Astrophysics Primer,"This review pertains to the Michael Jackson (no, not that Michael Jackson) reading of A Brief History of Time. Judged on the material alone, I would have given this audio book a 9. However, the reader takes Stephen Hawking's primer on astrophysics and turns it into a laughably bad presentation. He flubs words, puts ""umm"" and ""err"" everywhere trying to put forth some ""natural"" style of reading. Instead, it becomes truly annoying.I have noticed that there are 2 other audio book readings of the same work with later release dates. I would be willing to bet that the reaction to the Michael Jackson reading was so negative that Dove went back and re-recorded it."
4,Joy to read,"This great mind tries to explain to us laymen the principles of space and time, and he does it quite well. There are of course theories intermingled in amongst the hard science. It is so easily read and understandable that it is a joy to read. Black holes and quarks I find to be especially fascinating. This book is a good starter for understanding the particle science, the universe and the unknown.Wish you wellScott"
5,Wonderful Book for those who want to better understand the Universe,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would suggest it to anyone who is interested in knowing how the universe works and the steps that brought science to the current understanding of today. While many of the concepts are complicated, Hawking does a great job of explaining them so that a PhD. in physics is not required. Be prepared to go on an adventure through time and space to try and find the ultimate theory of the universe that explains it all!"
5,Do I need to talk about this book,This is a fine book for people who love physics of those who are curious about the universe they are in. A great book by a great scientist.
3,nice book with low quality!!,"I ordered a used book. The book store had described the book as ""good quality"". However, when I received the book, it was more liked a book chewed by a baby or sth. The book by itself is one of the best scientific books I've ever read. Now I can see the reason for such an outstanding number of sells for this book and author. LOVED IT."
5,Poptastic,"A 'poptastic' book. Give it less than 5 starts and your missing the point. Whats the title ""A brief history of time"" - the bloke saying it should look more at telescopes and such practicle things is wrong. He needs a book like ""A brief history of telescopes"", open your eyes, open your mind and LEARN - its what life's about.FANTSTIC"
2,I found it quite unbelievable,"Although I found quite a bit interesting the overall concept I found to being quite unbelievable. That Stalin intended that the North Koreans would lose the war, so that he intended to drag in the Chinese and that the US would for their own reasons allow the South Koreans to lose a limited defeat so that they could save them after a long fight once they got the US congress to support the war.Its just too far fetched. A simpler explanation would be that Kim a Korean nationalist decided to unify Korea, and Stalin, Mao and Kim all miscalculated the US response. So losing control."
5,Revelations about modern China,"Perhaps no journalist has written about China with the same mix of passion, fascination, adventure, amusement, frustration and disappointment as Seth Faison. From the day he arrived as a student in the early 1980s, to the end of his distinguished tour as the Shanghai correspondent for the New York Times more than 15 years later, Faison not only observed China's transformation, but reveled in it. He explored its cultural heritage, battled Communist bureaucrats, bargained with stock brokers, marched with democracy protesters, exposed movie pirates, escaped government minders in Tibet, and fell in and out of love. A book of this scope and ambition would founder in lesser hands. But Faison is a gifted tour guide. He uses his own privileged access and expert training to pry open Chinese society, and show it changed him."
4,Exellent and Often Overlooked Stereolab Offering....,"This is another great Stereolab cd... As another reviewer said you really can't go wrong with any of their stuff. Unbelievably, there is also a guitar solo on one of the songs which is pretty cool but also pretty funny at the same time since g-solos generally aren't part of the Stereolab sound.... As usual beatiful vocals and repetitious but interesting music... One of my favorite bands for sure."
1,Garbage! Pure trash!,"The only reason I gave this one star is because I don't have the option to give it '0'! What pile of stinking refuse this waste of time and money is. Someone here said that you need to keep in mind that this was a made-for-TV cartoon aimed at children, much like the Rankin-Bass version of the hobbit (which I love, by the way). THIS VERSION OF RETURN OF THE KING SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN MADE! The story is NOT a children's tale! It's just NOT! Too much of the manuscript needed to be changed and toned down in order to make it so. The entire screen adaptation is worthless. The only memorable scene is before the Black Gate with the Mouth of Sauron (which was decently done despite the rest of the 'movie'). There is one reason, and one reason alone to buy this foul, pitiful excuse for a DVD; you already have the The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings animated movies, and you want to have the full tale.GARBAGE! I SAY! TRASH! YUK, YUK, YUK!"
1,Poor Movie.,This really is a poor movie. The REAL version with Elijah Wood that comes out soon will be much better!Rated: PG for No Paticular Reason.Running Time: Approx. 96 Minutes
3,"A fun watch, but not accurate book-wise","Especially after seeing the release of Lord of the Rings, this is a fun departure back to my childhood of Bass cartoon stories. I loved the Last Unicorn, and this retelling of the LOTR story is fun to watch, even if it only touches on the basics of the story. Good introduction to the works, if nothing else, and fun for the kids.If you are an adult looking for a fun view into LOTR, however, this probably isn't it. It skips over almost everything that as an adult I found interesting with the books and movies, and focus mainly on the story of Sam and Frodo."
3,Left Wanting More,I am not a huge fan of the Hobbit or the Return of the King although I have both. They are very good movies but geared toward children. Republic Pictures did a movie The Lord of the Rings which I thought was more mature. The story itself was better although sporadic. The singing in these movies sometimes gets on my nerves as there is a lot of it. I find myself humming Frodo of the Nine Fingers quite a bit. It is good for a once around but cramming the trilogy into one movie just doesn't work.
1,What were they thinking?,"I watched this movie with a growing sense of disbelief and horror. What the hell were these guys thinking? The Hobbit, yes, it's a simple enough tale. but to see this made into a musical number had me alternating between rage and hysterical laughter. This actually made Ralph Bakshi's movie look GOOD. The horror!"
2,Why didn't Raplh Bakshi made this??,"To put it bluntly, Raplh Bakshi (the director of the animated LOTR) would've done a better job on this movie than Rankin and Bass. Bakshi wouldn't fill this animated trash with songs every ten minutes. And Bakshi wouldn't gave Frodo those big eyes either.The Hobbit was excellent, this movie isn't."
2,The Return of the King was a nice movie...,"A lot was cut out of the movie, which made it disapointing (where did legolis and that little dwarf go?). The movie went through a lot the story real quickly in such a short amount of time. The music was good... I don't hate the music, nor do I care for it very much either. It wasn't a great movie, but I liked it."
1,Do not buy it,"I bought this ""Lords of the Rings"" (animated) DVD (and sold it again on eBay almost nothing).The movie covered ""The Fellowship of the Rings"" and ""The Two Towers"". The Movie was actually well made and I bought ""The Return of the King"" blindly. I was very disappointed. Part III is not a Kids Book (it is not ""The Hobbit"" (This DVD was nice and appropriate)). ""The Return Of The King"" (Animated) is like a bad Disney Movie. I read the books a couple times and after 10 Minutes watching ""The Return of the King"".. I could not stand it no more and turned it off. I just can give you this advice: DON'T BUY IT! Take your kids to the cinema and watch a nice Disney movie instead.(Original review March 12, 2002)"
2,A bad movie!,"This movie cracked me up. Songs like ""Wheres there a whip, theres a way!"" and funny lines from Bilbo Baggins like ""bless my soul!"" This movie is a crackup! However, despite its stupidity it really does not have the drama and climax that the Hobbitt did (this was the previous movie made by this studio)."
2,Cries out for some editing,"Being a big fan of ""Blue Highways"", I was disappointed with the author's river version of this journey. The concept was nice and the writing good at times, but overall the book dragged and could have done with some editing to slice a 100 pages or so from the text.I also thought the device of creating a first mate from the many visitors did not work well. I would have enjoyed some sea tales and stories about the cast of people who joined him along the way.Overall, disappointing.But that is what you get when you set the bar so high with your first travel book."
3,"Tedious, but should be read","William Trogdon, alias Heat-Moon, has a Ph.d in English, and it shows. He has a vast command of the language and has keen observations.This is a very interesting book if you take the time to trace his travels on a map, or preferably, Google Earth and see sat photos of the rivers. It is also an excellent education in geography. From the harbor of New York to the Pacific Ocean is pretty impressive. I envy this man for the courage and fortitude to do this voyage.My negatives are: a constant search for all things Indian. Trogdon seems to have trouble with his identity.The writing is somewhat pedantic and stiff. It takes many sittings to get thru the book. Next, his willingness to eat as much meat as he can makes me sick and I thought much less of him when the book was finished. Finally, he is pretty liberal and makes nasty comments about conservatives."
1,was this book put together by undergrads learning finance for the first time?,"I am a current university student taking corporate finance and have been forced into using this book. It is horrible. It appears as if the three authors wrote different parts of the book independently of one another. The writing style throughout the book is very inconsistent. As well, some of the explanations are simply terrible. They make learning about some of the subjects way more difficult than they actually are. Unless you are required to use this book, I'm sure you can find something better."
1,Collegebooksdirect,"This rating has nothing to do with the book itself, but is a reflection on the low quality of the seller--collegebooksdirect. This was my first time ever buying something from this seller, and my order for this textbook had been placed and confirmed, they charged my account, and I was expecting to receive the package today, but, literally out of nowhere, they cancelled my order without explanation. I do not trust collegebooksdirect and will never buy anything from them again--my strong advice is for you to do the same."
3,"Smaller, less comfortable than expected for price","In my journey to find an ice cream scoop that works well and doesn't become corroded, I bought this. I'm optimistic that its finish will not break down or erupt in the center of the scoop's bowl like most of the others I've tried. However, this scoop is smaller than I expected and the loop on the handle hurts my hand when I try to scoop ""hard"" ice cream. So far, it does seem strong enough despite my reservations about the skinny rod connecting the bowl to the handle, but having to use a pot holder to protect my palm makes it all too awkward. I much prefer the shape of the Zyliss scoop at http://www.amazon.com/Zyliss-71372-Ice-Cream-Ergonomic-Plastic/dp/B00008TAB2 and its handle is way more comfortable, but the Zyliss's handle becomes loose and its finish breaks down after about a year. I'm giving this three stars because for $20 I think the designer could have done more research."
5,Actually easier to use,It was really important to me that my new ice cream scoop both be easy to use and dishwasher-safe. This one fit both bills.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"An amusing book, with the unlikely hero, if you want to call it that, of Rumpole, a pretty ordinary looking lawyer, toiling away at his job of defending clients, putting up with his wife, his co-workers, and all that sort of thing.However, he does tend to stick up the underdog and try and look into things that don't seem right."
5,Well acted mystery that evokes history,"There is really nothing of significance that can be said after Atheen M. Wilson's excellent review of this film other than to suggest that people seeking an opinion of the film read this review. This is the first film in the Cadfael TV series, although it is the second book that Ellis Peters wrote about this rather clever and worldly, although also religious, monk. Thus, the producers of the film used it to inform us about Cadfael's past as a knight during the crusades and his fighting in Jerusalem. It is now 1138 in England. Cadfael is told to bury 94 bodies of supporters of Queen Maud who had been hanged by King Steven, but discovers that there are 95 bodies and one was not hanged. The plot reveals much about the civil war between Maud and Steven, about how Hugh Beringer becomes a friend of Cadfael and is appointed sheriff, how Cadfael saves huge amounts of money for Queen Maud, a woman, and a man, and solves who killed the 95th man and why he did so."
4,clawhammer banjo,"The tablature is clearly laid out, easy to read. A minor criticism: the book is separated into sections by tuning but occassionally the tunes seem to be misplaced. I happen to have heard most of the tunes so perhaps I found the book more useful than some might."
5,Excellent beginning collector reference book.,Beautiful color pictures throughout. If you are looking for a reference book to take with you antique shopping for blue & white stoneware this is the book for you.
4,Suzannah's Surprise Garden,This was a good story that moved at a fast pace and kept the pages turning. Perfect when you need to get things off your mind and lose yourself in someone else and their difficulties. I chose it to compare the story with my own family member who will need assisted living very soon. It was helpful to learn the similarities and encouraging that things might just work out well with a little patience. I did not expect to be also reading a very interesting mystery ! It was a surprise and a great escape. Macomber always places a life lesson in her stories and this one has more than a couple. Worth the read.
4,Might have been,"Fifty year old Susannah is experiencing a kind of later, mid life crisis as she faces the prospect of choosing a care facility for her recently widowed mother, a woman who has always had decisions made for her and relied on others to make her life pleasant. Susannah's twenty year old daughter is behaving in a way that one could expect from a 14 year old, with sulks, tantrums and total selfishness and gives the reader the BIGGEST urge to slap her! When Susannah moves back with her mother to arrange the dismantling and selling of her house, she gets an urge to look up an old boyfriend, one with whom she'd had a romance which was broken up by her father and for which she'd never forgiven him. She contacts an old girl friend and together they piece together the scenario which was played out, all those years ago. Circumstances come to light which now exonerate Susannah's father and allow her to find closure to her long held bitterness about what might have been."
3,Blossom Street book?.......I'm not sure,"I can't say that this was a Blossom Street book other than Susannah ended up buying the flower shop. When I sit down to read a book that is part of a series I expect at least some of the characters in the series appear at some point and they didn't in this book.I must say that I had a tough time reading this book because it was slow moving until it got close to the end. I hate books that do that, I'd rather they move at a continuous pace. It almost seemed like the author had a hard time telling the story until she got close to deadline and then the pace picked up. I also didn't like the fact that the problem with Troy Nance was never really solved, it was left up in the air with Susannah's husband saying he would ""take care of it"". If you are reading the Blossom Street series don't feel bad if you skip this book, I probably should have."
1,Diappointed,"This is the first book by this author that I have read, and I was very disappointed. The characters were not at all believeable, and the plot twists were so far fetched, it was almost laughable. Chrissie was the biggest spoiled brat I could ever imagine, and her mother was a dishrag with no backbone and not a lick of common sense. I couldn't believe that she went along with Troy's idea so that he would leave her daughter alone. I did feel sorry for Vivian who never knew that her son was alive. As an earlier reviewer said, it would have been beneficial to have a story about having to put a parent in a assisted living facility that actually would have been a real story, since many people are dealing with that issue."
5,IT Process Improvement - About Time,"It is about time a book like this get written. The authors have hit a nerve with the typical IT department. That is, taking the ""rambo"" fire fighting mentality out of I/S, and conforming it into a smooth running operation. The authors take lessons learned years ago in manufacturing and engineering disciplines, and have correctly applied them to IT. The book is written exceptionally well, is easy to understand and provides a practical step-by-step methodology. I believe there is enough detail in the book to allow motivated and savvy IT managers to drive process improvement in their organizations. This book is definitely a ""keeper"". It should be part of every I/S manager's library, and it should not gather dust."
4,Senior Fitness,For someone that has never exercised this book is a must have. I was looking for different exercises other than what I have already been doing and was disappointed that I spent the money on something that I already knew.
5,Love this book!,This is a wonderful authentic Ozark novel written by a true Ozarkian that lived there and knew the people. Lane is a fabulous and creative writer with supreme talent.She is compared to Vance Randolph who is also of extreme talent and very learned of the Ozark region!This book should be put back into circulation for the good of the all!
5,Nutritious and Great!,My husband and I have 16 finches. This is a great food to have. Last year two of our Zebra Finches bred 5 finches. This food is great for nutrition and for birds when they are in the process of breeding. It's also great to keep on hand.
2,Halo wanna-be?,"This game tries to be like Halo, then changes things around enough to the point where you might not be able to tell... But trust me we all do. I'll start with online... it sucks. If you are used to Halo's xbox live pre-game lobbies and buddy lists then you are in for one hell of a awkward time with this game. You are forced to join games that are already in session or create your own from scratch and wait for others to come.. which could be quite awhile unless you have friends on to invite. The guns suck, the maps suck, the laughable copy of Halo vehicles sucks and are incredibly hard to control. Most FPS fans will turn this off within minutes but i gave it a chance because i am so bored with bungie's half-ass effort to bring us new maps. but i'd rather be bored playing the same halo maps over and over then playing this garbage. Man this game blows"
2,Too big and bulky...does not fit under our counter,"I bought this for our son so he could eat at the kitchen bar/counter with the rest of the family. It didn't fit at all, the arms that secure it to the table were too long to get completely under the counter. Also, seems to be too bulky to consider a travel chair."
2,counter seat for child,"My daughter has a very deep counter, but this child seat leaves up to 12"" in between the seat and the edge of the counter leaving a lot of room for food to fall on the floor. The seat should go further into the counter, more mesh with the surface - no one would consciously sit this far away from the table edge. I used something called a Sassy Seat when my daughter was little and it was compact and easy to transport. This seat is cumbersome and doesn't travel as easily. I wasn't that impressed so I returned the second one I bought."
3,Misleading picture but satisfactory product,"The picture on the box/website makes this portable chair look like it folds up like an umbrella. It does not. The underside braces fold sideways and inwards, so the chair is flat horizontally, however there is nothing keeping them folded. I keep this chair at our friends' house, so we don't have to port it, and it stores perfectly well. However, I would not recommend this chair to use in and out of a restaurant because it does not fold small nor stay folded. On the plus side, it is very strong. On our friend's stable table, the chair does not move, and I have every confidence of our toddler moving around in it."
5,AWESOME SEAT,"This seat is great and fits on most tables. We've taken this on several out of town trips and haven't had a problem. There are no problems with stability, its an easy clean up and stores easily since it is so compact once broken down.If you travel with your baby or eat at places other than your home a lot this chair is perfect. There is so much you have to pack when traveling with a baby so having something compact and reliable like this is definitely a help. We've had no problems so far. We've been using this seat since my daughter was about 9 months old and she is now 18 months."
4,"Great for travel, but still like the high chair","Our son really likes sitting in this chair because he has plenty of space to move around. Unfortunately, it also makes it very hard to feed him. We take it on trips and even to parties and restaurants. It can be folded flat without removing the fabric. It would be better if it had a 5 point harness (adding shoulder straps) instead of the three. Our son can stand up even when strapped in."
2,Tricky to clean,"We really like Chicco products and have many of them. This chair is a disappointment, however. It would be so much better if it was made of a wipeable fabric. It does not spot clean well, and trying to disassemble and pull the fabric seat off is a headache and takes too much time. Also, the belt really isn't secure enough and frequently one of the sides will not come undone when you depress the button to get baby out. We're constantly struggling with it. Also, it's really too cumbersome to actually fold up and take somewhere."
5,Very good chair,We used these chairs (for 8 month old twins) on Thanksgiving and everyone was so impressed with them. My table is pretty thick but these went on no problem. They are very sturdy and can fit close to the table. Since the twins weigh 20 pounds each they will be using these chairs for a long time. Two people at dinner liked them so much that they are going to order them also.
4,Great buy,I recently bought the chair or my 6 month old little girl. It's definitely made for older babies. I bought it to replce the bumbo seats when we eat out. Its gokng to a while before she grows into it . So bumbo it shall be for another two to three months. What i like! It's has and adjustable seat belt. It is easy to clean. You just need a wet towel to wipe off the food after each feeding an your golden. If you let te food dry you might have to scub along with the wet towel. No biggie. The only problem I have with it is that it's a bit big for my daughter as it sits her too far back away from the table and too low. Its not a bi deal as she isn't feeding herself just yet. It's easy to install. Our table has a 5 inch skirt and fits fine with about an inch and half to spare. Good construction and easily folds up to carry.
2,Mil. thickness is an issue..,"The poly is way to thin, The mil. thickness is about half of other poly bags I have ordered online. The flap where the glue, (adhesive) is, the sealing strip is about 1/3 the height of other sealing strips. The flap does seem to stay sealed, but a bit more adhesive would be much more secure. All in all, I guess the bags are still pretty indestructible, but a thicker mil. poly would be more beneficial."
2,Terribly Thin,"The seller I previously bought these from on Amazon doesn't sell them anymore. This time I bought from Propackagingsupply and I received completely different polymailers than I was expecting. The size is right but they're really thin--the edge of a small cardboard box ripped a hole right through the mailer as I (gently) packed it up. I had to double up the polymailers so what I was mailing didn't rip through the mailer, effectively meaning I was only able to mail 50 items, not 100, since I used two mailers per package. If you are mailing something soft like clothes these will probably work, but ANYTHING with even a soft edge and I cannot recommend these at all."
3,Small,Beware this is a smaller mailer envelope. It is to small for mailing shirts or clothing. I will not buy again.
5,Just as expected,These poly mailers were a fantastic price and the product was perfect. Exactly as we expected when placing the order!
4,Envelopes,"The product was what I expected but, they only sent 88 as opposed to advertising 100 for my purchase price."
1,Made in China,This came with a sticker that said Made in China. Very disappointed and will be returning.
4,Prettier Doll,"I'm not a fan of the Blond Barbie but my daughter had been asking for this one for about six months. I finally broke down and went looking for it for X-Mas. After looking at the two versions I settled on the African American version (even if we are a White Hispanic family). Why? Becuase of the two this one was the prettier. Her face is much nicer and the dark hair complements the purple dress much better. If you are looking for a doll that will look nice while still providing entertainment for your child, get this doll. I'm glad I did."
3,Modern Physics Course,"As a college student taking Modern Physics, I found this book to be very helpful with my homework. Many of the subjects covered in my course were found to also be in the Schaum's Outline of Modern Physics. What it does severely lack in is explanation. For me, I skipped using it to learn anything, and just focused on following the example problems step-by-step (with different numbers, of course!) For the average student looking for a little help, I'd definitely suggest this book!"
2,Didn't fit my course...,"This didn't fit in with the book we were using: ""Modern Physics"" by Tipler and Llewellyn. This book completely neglected much of the quantum portion. Be sure to buy that book also. Kind of elementary."
1,Waste of money,"This was one of the WORST movies I have ever seen in my ENTIRE life.Maybe if I wanted to get high and kill myself, it'd be my thing. But I hated it. Absolutely hated it."
1,Preview first,"Had hoped to use this with students to stimulate discussion about suicide. However, the language used in the film makes it impossible to use in a school setting. It is too bad that the suicide prevention group didn't consider a teen audience and how necessary a resource like this could be."
3,"Rosle 10.5 "" Flat Wisk","Nice wisk, but don't be fooled by the USA or Germany in the description. It has a sticker on it - ""Made in China"".Just so you would know..."
1,Did not care for,It was not what I thought it would be. I rahter stick with the study bible. I actually used this bible as a stand by for the young adults that I teach on Wednesday. That is only if they do nto have one of their own.
5,Forget Mozart ! Get a shape sorter to teach math skills!,"Experts say that listening to Classical music could help kids to be sharp at math, but I know that this toy has taught my son basic geometry at age 2 1/2 ! At first we ""did shapes"" together; I would guide each piece into the proper hole as I said its name. By age 2, he could identify and name the shapes as he dropped them in, much to the amazement of his Daddy (""Even I don't know what a trapezoid is !""). With 18 different shapes, this toy has more variety than other shape sorters. It's one of my son's favorite tub toys, too. As for durability, he kept escaping from his playpen until I discovered that he was using the shape sorter as a stepladder!"
3,Picture History of the SS United States,"Good from the image point of view but light on technical and development information.No information at all on engine specs or routines at sea, even more anecdotal or personal histories would have enlightened this lightweight history.Likewise more internal shots aboard the ship while at sea rather than posed publicity photos.Background of the US Lines and their ships was interesting but may have taken space away from the ""Star of the Show""."
3,Haunted CD Player,"The one drawback of this toy is that it randomly starts playing at all hours of the day and night. Once you get used to it, it's not so bad. My 9 month old loves this toy but is not yet able to use it on her own. It doesn't require batteries, which is also an added bonus. It is a little bit loud."
4,"Hair, Hair, everywhere",I gave my daughter this doll for Christmas as she loved the movie. She loves the doll but the plastic hair is everywhere! Beware if you get this and the horse! The hair can tangle even the sturdiest vacum!
1,Worst battery life,I bought this phone for speakerphone and it was free (in 2004). The quality of speakerphone is satisfactory (definately better than sanyo)The battery life is very very low. It may be about one call of 40 minutes. It also doesn't give few minutes before one can notice that battery is draining because it draines within 5-8 mins once you notice 4 bars (max is 5 bars)Camera is totaly worthless as it has very blurry/grainy picture.The phone also works very slowly.In case if it's on eg. if you hit menu button by mistake it will stay on untill you exit after hours. There is no settings that can change this property and it ultimately drains batery even more quickly. And the same thing is bothersome as if you turn the alarm on but the phone turns on then the alarm will not work!!!!!!In short I would never buy a NOKIA again.
3,I found more words that I heard in Rome than in other books.,"I have the French, Spanish, and Italian versions of this book and found them to be right on the money as far as translating the words I encountered on foreign travel. I like them."
1,1 star is giving them too many,one word: crapthis album is horrible. I bought it going in thinking most of the tracks were as good as the 2nd one. i was dead wrong. The music itself is fine rock n roll but when the singer steps up he sounds like a dying calf. i couldn't get through the first five tracks before i got pissed and turned it off. please don't buy this album and be mad at yourself for the rest of the day for wasting your valuable money. They should be paying us to listen to this crap!
1,Waste of money,"I was online looking for supplemental baby sign things to teach our daughter more baby signs. I wish I'd seen the negative reviews on Amazon.com before I'd bought it. These signs are all ASL... you can do just as well to look them up in an ASL dictionary. And many of the signs aren't very useful to even try to teach a baby (how can a baby learn the 3 signs in ""I love you""??)The flash cards are not cards for the babies to look at (which is what I had thought they would be), and the book (pamphlet) is a joke. I've not used this thing at all and wish I hadn't gotten it.If you want to get a start in baby sign... get the 4 Baby Sign board books. If your baby likes books, your baby will most undoubtedly love those books. If your baby learns all the signs in those books, pass on this flash card pack, and instead get creative with an ASL dictionary."
1,"PC Garbage, errors (put it back)","Reconstruction was AFTER Lincoln. Someone needs to point this out to Mr. Simpson. Andrew Johnson attempted to do the same type of Reconstruction Lincoln wanted, ""let'em up easy"". The Radicals hated Johnson, as Johnson turned out NOT to be their puppet, and he REALLY was a Democrat. Simpson feels the need to bash Johnson, as HIS HERO, GENERAL Grant,[look at his books] was the NEXT President. According to Simpson Grant was in fact one of the BEST Presidents!! (Right!!!LOL) Finally, Simpson pushes all the blame on those Southern people. Get real Mr. Simpson, contrary to your writing, (just because YOU write something, does NOT mean it is fact), the South was not wearing black hats, and the North was not wearing white hats. This book is full of anti-southern propaganda, hoping gullible readers will take it as fact. It's a waste of money. I give it only one star, as I can't give it a zero, which it deserves."
3,Bland,I was so excited to find this mix and made it for Thanksgiving. I was so disappointed because it was so mild flavored one really could not tell it was supposed to be pumpkin flavored. I have one package left and plan to add canned pumpkin to it to try.
3,Original UFO,"For anyone thinking about buying this, you should know that it's not Michael Schenker on guitar, it's original guitarist Mick Bolton. That said, it's not quite as good as Phenomenon, but not that bad either. This is a band still trying to find their sound, doing mostly covers, and sticking to their roots. Mick Bolton's guitar playing is no match for Schenker's, but it's still pretty good. Includes covers of Eddie Cochran's ""C'mon Everybody"", Bo Diddley's ""Who Do You Love"", and Paul Butterfield's ""Loving Cup."" ""Follow You Home"" is a huge ripoff of the Kinks, repeating the riff off of ""You Really Got Me"" a hundred times. Not bad performances, but the material is pretty simple in structure but played with plenty of energy. Recommended for those who are interested in the roots of the early British heavy metal acts."
5,Cute little sandals,My daughter is a new walker. These sandals are working really well with her little uneasy steps. The dual velcro closures make it simple to adjust as we go.
2,She's advertising for Abercrombie,"She uh... well do you want your kid to be a snob? Seriosly this is advertising for your children to be arrogant...Do you want your kid not hanging around people because she says their ""uncool."" Just because of their money? This doll is the kind that way."
5,MUIR,"THIS IS THE ULTIMATE VOLUME FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN THE GREAT MAN.I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL I VISITED THE USA TO BUY IT,AS IT'S NOT AVAILABLEIN THE UK.THE DETAIL AND DIVERSITY IS INCREDIBLE AND YOU ALMOST FEELAS THOUGH YOU ARE IN YOSEMITE, ARGUABLY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACE ON EARTH."
3,Not what I wanted,So not waterproof it quit working the first time it got wet. Next time you say waterproof make sure it is
3,where's the romance,"This is a fairly well-written book, but it's not exactly a romance. It is a murder mystery: trap eight people in a Scottish castle with a murderer. There is an attractive heroine and a preposessing, titled suitor. There are, however, a great many young ladies in Great Britain and we are given no clue as to why he shoud fall immediatly in love with this one. I immediately as in on-first-sight-for-no-reason-whatever. Following this event there is some romantic tension since he cannot admit his love for her. Come to think of it, there seems to be no reason why he cannot. Perhaps the author had a reason but if so, she forgot to tell us."
2,almost good,"If you like other Chris Farley and Matthew Perry films, then you will probably like this one (i.e., ""Tommy Boy"" or ""The Whole Nine Yards""). It is a lot of physical comedy and slapstick sight gags. It does not have much originality to it, except for a few pretty funny surprises. For most of the movie gags, you can see the punchlines coming a mile away. If you don't mind this and still find the same types of things funny no matter how many times you see them, then you will enjoy the film. The film does cater toward the typical sophmoric guy humor for the most part. The jacket even says ""crude humor"". The best parts involve Farley and Perry dealing with the crazy leader of wandering conquisadors; their final standoff with them is particularly funny, especially the unusual way they end up overtaking them."
4,Chris Farley...,"If you are a Chris Farley fan you will enjoy this film. The story is weak, however Farley alone makes this film watchable."
2,What is this?,I was so happy when the local video store had a copy of this for me to rent! The feeling quickly faded as I sat through one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I loved Farley's other movies but this is not funny at all.
1,Worst movie award,Quite possibly the worst movie I have seen in the past 25 years. What a waste of time for me and for all the people involved in making this poor excuse for a film. It was pathetic.
5,Funny if you like comedy,"This movie should go down as one of Chris Farley's finest, funniest, and goofiest movie. Mathew Perry (unlike his role on Friends) is hilarious. Farley carries this movie on his chubby shoulders, and Perry compliments him very well."
3,Good Can Opener with minor design flaw,"I bought this opener in 2002 and it finally failed after about 5 years of regular use. The design is very clever but is not robust enough to last a lifetime like the old fashioned, cut-the top kind of opener.This opener has a drive mechanism that draws the cutter/drive wheel into the outside rim of the can when you first start to spin the handle. Continuing to spin the handle maintains the pressure between the can and the cutter/drive wheel so the can is rotated as the cutter cuts through the outside of the rim. The flaw is that as the the little teeth in the drive wheel wear over time, the contact pressure between the rim and the teeth is reduced and the drive wheel starts to slip. Or, as another reviewer puts it, the can opener ""poops out"".I like the opener, but would love it if it lasted longer."
4,Sleek and sublime,"What gorgeous German engineering! The opening technique of this tool is simple a pleasure to witness. However, a word of warning: it does require the proper placement to ensure grip and correct opening. I did it incorrectly once and managed to create lots of little microscopic shards of metal that was painful and dangerous; in the end I flipped the can over and placed it properly and it worked beautifully. Proper placement is everything."
2,Worked great for 2 years,I really liked this can opener for the first two years that I had it. Then it suddenly stopped working. I don't like it any more. Now I must research and but a new can opener that I hope will last longer than this one did.
1,Worthless,"This is the worst can opener I have ever purchased. I was tired of the Dollar Store El Cheapos so I went out to buy the most expensive one I could find. Big mistake! You need to be a rocket scientist to figure out how to fit this to the can, and then a sumo wrestler to turn the knob!"
1,Just Wait.,This device was fantastic for about 2 months of use but the blades/cutting don't last.. If you are willing to purchase 4 or 5 a year you will have a great can opening experience.
2,Rosle can opener peters out,"We have had our Rosle can opener for three years and it was incredible. Lifetime warranty, what could go wrong. Well, it just stopped working. The knob turns, but the cutter goes no where. Lifetime warranty? You cannot get it replaced except in Germany. It's not worth the $35 purchase price if it stops working and you cannot get it replaced for free."
1,Garbage,Do not buy this. Waste of money. Cost about 5 cents to open each can. Is it guaranteed for life? Mine died after a very short life
2,Drive customer service is not good.,"The clamping lever on one end of the bar failed after about one year. Drive would not honor their 3 year warranty, insisting that the lever was part of the suction cup which only has one year warranty. For want of a 50 cent part, Drive wanted me to purchase the entire suction cup assembly for almost as much as I paid for the unit in the first place. An overpriced product and poor customer service does not rate many stars. I purchased a cheap (about 25$) unit at the same time as the Drive unit and I use it regularly (3-4 times per week) same as the Drive, and it's holding up just fine. The Drive unit looks like quality, maybe this was just a flaw but the poor customer service does it for me. I will never buy another Drive product."
4,stories were to simular,good spaghetti westerns but the stores were too similar wished they were more different. loved the 3 background characters though.
4,My daughter loves this baby!,"I received this baby doll as a gift for daughter who is now 15 months old. I didn't think it was as cute as other cloth dolls, because this one has a plastic face. And it makes a squeaking noise that reminded me of a dog toy! But once she was able to hold and cuddle her ""babies"", this has been her favorite! It goes with us everywhere. It's the perfect size for her to hug and carry around. It's so easy to clean in the washing machine, too! I have been looking for another one at the toy stores in our area, and haven't been able to find them. Even the Toys R Us store doesn't carry them anymore. I'm buying two: one as a back up, and another for my niece as a Christmas gift."
4,A very good series.,"This is a very good series. Barry is a fully dimensional character with strong family ties and good friends. The sense of place is wonderfully done and dialogue is very true. He provides an interesting look into the human side of the funeral business, which I very much enjoyed. And, it's still a tight mystery with very good suspense. If you've not discovered this series, I definitely recommend giving it a try."
4,An amusing and educational gift,"This book turned out to be a quite fun read. The authors filtered into the educational stuff some humoring anecdotes that bring a smile to your face, not too mention the humor involved in the actual questions and answers themselves. And they do cover a lot of the questions that people ask or you have wondered yourself, so it brings an amount of familiarity to the book that makes for an easy read.I would recommend this book to anyone. The best place and time to read, and the authors say so themselves, is when you go to the toilet. So grab the book and go and drop the kids off and enjoy."
3,Answers a lot of weird medical questions,"Fairly interesting, sometimes funny but informative. Scope is narrow, the authors even admit this. This book discusses some of the most unique questions about the body as well as urban legends that have accumulated over the years. This topic is not as extensive and some people like to think."
3,Weird format. Fiction/Non-Fiction based book?,"Although I can tell these authors are great friends, and brilliant and funny guys... I don't get the way they have written this book. It is very much based at a party - each chapter has an introduction with characters in a party setting, which is a LEAD-IN to the questions. Strange, but I did enjoy the book ... but it is a bit outdated. Maybe when this book was written, these questions were unknown, but most of these facts are VERY well known today. And if they're not, their answers can easily be obtained..."
4,Some Answers to Odd Questions,"Nobody is going to write their dissertation based on the information in this book. At least, we should all hope we never see a doctor that used this plan. In some cases, the authors take time to answer questions about medical or anatomical oddities. Other times, they prefer to write a witty remark. Including the ""instant messaging"" between authors, there is a lot of fluff in this book. Still, it is an amusing and educational read.The book is most suited to be a coffee table book or perhaps toilet reading. A reader probably should not try to read this book in only a few sittings. It is best digested a little at a time. I have not fact checked the statements in this book for validity, though I suspect others have. Even if there are flaws, I suspect few people would walk away from this book without learning something."
2,Disappointing,"Very, very little actual medical information. The research is lacking and questions are answered very briefly. The answers provided are not reasonable answers to questions they wrote themselves. It seems like a book that was churned out in a weekend. This book could have been much more but it ended up just being an entire book of filler.Even though it's ridiculously short, the authors added more inane filler between answering questions. The actual interesting content of this book is easily less than a third of its total (puny) volume. Don't waste your time.I would recommend a book in the same genre that is way, way more interesting and informative:The Hypochondriac's Guide to Life. And Death."
3,Typical,"This book is fun for anyone who doesn't read these much. However, if you are a fan / collector of imponderables, this is one may be a little redundant of many you've read before. Goes on tangents and narratives a lot rather than addressing many questions directly."
1,Self-indulgent waste of money,"I have never been that interested in other people's emails and IMs. Why, then, would I care what these writers email and IM to each other? It seems to provide nothing but filler for what would otherwise be a short, slightly funny, magazine article. The fact that Layner is a published author already is even more appalling. He should know better. The medical items are further buried in a (hopefully) fictional story of a party the authors attend. The details of that are too lengthy and both boorish and unneccessary. When I compare this book to truly well-written and informative tomes such as Freakonomics, I wonder (a) how this made the NYT best-seller list, (b) got such great reviews, and (c) how to get my money back."
2,Not what I expected...,I expected this book to be answers to medical questions that we've all pondered from time to time and haven't looked up. The book is roughly half medical answers and half pointless IM interactions between the authors. If the IM interactions weren't in the book I would have rated it a lot higher. If you buy this book skip the IM interactions and you'll enjoy it.
2,"Worth what I paid for it, but let me explain...","I picked this up at a garage sale in Midland, Tx, my new hometown, last week, for fifty cents. Interesting questions about the anatomy and oddities of human bodies, answered by a real doctor, put together by a real writer, seemed like a sure bet to entertain me. However, the doctor and the writer seem to bring out the worst in each other, not the best. Their attempts at humor were juvenile and lame. (Is that redundant?) Some of the questions were intriguing, some of the factual answers striking, but overall, this was about a one-hour read, with only a few laughs, and gave no information I could not live without. My copy will go in our own next garage sale, marked for a dime."
3,"Another here today, gone tomorrow sort of thing","Men have nipples because all mammals start out as females. The male is a modification of the female made very very early in the life of a female fetus. Being a male is caused by a recessive gene. It also brings along with it a whole host of other little qualities, color blindness and baldness the most benign. Any good biology class will tell you this, only there are few good biology classes. As Ashley Montague said (a brilliant teacher and once biologist): Men don't want to hear this stuff and so have refused to listen...even though they walk through the world with two little useless nipples advertizing the truth from cradle to grave.I'm a male. I can take it. Nature is a saucy bitch."
4,Fun obscure knowledge.,"I actually finished this book in one day. It's easy and enjoyable to read. The explanations don't get heavily into medical terms and jokes are cracked constantly throughout the book, keeping it light and fun to read. There's IM sessions between the authors throughout the book and first person narration at the beginning of each chapter. It helps to keep the book from getting to impersonal. What I mean is that this book isn't just facts or questions and answers. The authors are a constant presence throughout the whole book and they will keep you laughing. There are a few questions in the book where I had to reread because I missed what the answer was, but this only happened maybe once or twice. This is an excellent book if you like obscure facts or just want to be entertained."
2,small and unsatisfying,"half of the book is useless filler - boring IM conversations between the two authors, puny attempts at being original and funny. editors... what editors?!the other half of the book... well, contains unsatisfying answers to somewhat interesting questions.the book's tone is tormented, authors desperation of ""we have to finish this book"" can be seen in open text in so many places... one starts to feel for them and starts asking oneself ""am i done reading this tiny book yet? ... how about now?"""
2,Too much filler,"I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of the depth in answering many of the questions. (e.g. How 'bout some statistics or some more interesting related facts?)But the biggest disappointment is how much of the book is filled with what I can only describe as Instant Messager logs of discussions between the two authors. Some of them are sort-of humorous, but it just came off as blatant filler to me."
2,Too much blah-blah,"Although the book was funny and enlightening at some points, the dialouge was rambling and boring."
4,interesting and fun,"I KNOW the answer to the question posed in the title (after all, I am a man.) What a fun and interesting idea. As a fellow author (8 Weeks to a Healthy Dog, The Allergy Solution for Dogs, and the award-winning The Natural Health Bible for Dogs & Cats,)I always appreciate the creativity other authors use in coming up with their ideas for their books...A destined fun best seller here.Shawn Messonnier DVM"
5,Ask away!,"A great book. In somewhat of a twist, it was actually one of my patients that recommended this book to me. As a physician practicing almost 25 years, I've heard a lot of these strange but interesting questions before--""Can my contact lens get stuck behind my eye?""--but others I've never met anyone with the gall to ask (""How do people in wheelchairs have sex?"").It's an interesting premise: there's tons of things people would like to know, but are too afraid to ask. Well, all of these questions are easily answered by a knowledgable person with a little medical experience. But it's the funny, fast-paced format of Leyner that makes this book a success. This is a terrific bookeasy to read, and if you still have questions, give me or your doctor a call."
1,A triumph of marketing over content,There are still some disadvantages to buying books online. If you skimmed through the pages of this book you would never buy it. The text is superficial and the content looks as if it was all obtained by googling. Save your money
1,"not great, not good, just aweful!","This book looked interesting, and after reading the reviews that others left, I bought it. Well, after reading some, I'm returning it. It's completely ridiculous. The author seems unsure about most of the info and gives very vague answers to the questions. Don't waste your money."
1,Made. In. China. NOT Germany,The Rosle twirl whisk I received today says Made in China on the sticker. I'm sure it performs like any other twirl whisk but that isn't the point. The description for this item is not accurate.I had several choices and I paid a premium for this brand because the description on Amazon states it is Made In Germany. Maybe it was at one time but that isn't the case any more. The sticker states plainly 18/10 s/s Made in China.I returned this one and purchased theKuhn Rikon 10-Inch Galaxy Spring Whiskinstead. I am very happy with the quality and performance of the less expensive whisk from Kuhn Rikon.
3,Before the sharp decline,"House Seasons 1-5 are probably the best, this season is aguably the one where House loses its core fan base and led to its final episode a few months ago."
4,"House, M.D. Season Six","The quality was not as good as some dvd's I purchased, but it was still worth the money.There was a small imperfection on one of the dvd's that made viewing a little difficult."
3,Downhill,A dropoff in quality. The only thing worse is season seven. David Shore was sorely missed in season 6/7. A tarnished legacy from a # 1 fan.
4,Different,She's a petite cute doll with a quaint face and cute accesories. She's not like everyother doll and being not the norm added her appeal as far as I was concerned. Hey her nails are polished!
4,Smart Book & Accurate Research,Other than the small form factor of the book this book has a multitude of information about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. I personally agree strongly with the conclusions of the book and I'm convinced they are based in the strong reality that the Saudi economy is based solely on oil revenues.I have lived in the kingdom for more than a year and fully comprehend the authors views and conclusions about what is transpiring there.
2,"Good, but a bit obsolete","It's not a bad book, but forget it if you're runninga budget home studio, this man talks about (pretty old, now)devices that costs, each, more than your motorbike.Perhaps it's a bit obsolete, in a today's audio worldwhere everything is mostly based on softwarebob is still talking about analog equalizers or something like..."
4,great toy for night time,"Bought this for my 4 and 2 1/2 year old sons. They each have one and can keep themselves ""safe"" all night. The first week they had them they actually wanted to go to bed so they could play with their flashlights. The best feature is the auto off but my kids really enjoy switching the color lenses. Also, my 2 1/2 year old regularly drops his out of his crib and the flashlight is no worse for wear."
4,worth the wait,"iv'e been waiting for this album to be released for a long time now. it sounds just as i remember it. GREAT! It's got all kinds of musical flavors. Rock,Jazz,Latin, all rolled into one. nice price too! highly recommended."
3,Worked great while it lasted,"This garlic press worked great for about 3 months--it easily crushed garlic pushing out everything leaving the peels. However, after 3 months one of the rivots holding the hinge broke with no way to fix. At that point the press became useless.I would buy it again in a heartbeat if I knew it wouldn't break again."
5,Rosle press,"Having small hands and rather weak wrists, using an ordinary garlic press was often a painful experience. After reading several reviews of the Rosle press, I decided it would be worth experimenting with. I find that it really does require less strength. There's a feeling of having more leverage. Inserting a clove initially seemed more awkward than with a typical press because there are more moving parts, and they need to be held in the right position. Cleaning is easier (as advertised), because the holes are a bit larger than with a standard press and don't seem to get clogged. It's pricey for a garlic press, but worth it to avoid wrist injury."
4,Can't pinch my fingers with this one,"I bought this garlic press some time ago, and have gotten consistently good use out of it.I've heard it said that there's a better one out there by Kuhn Rikon, but from what I've seen of the design, I'm better off with this one, since every other garlic press I've tried with that design managed to pinch my fingers.The design of this one by Rösle makes it almost impossible to pinch your fingers when pressing the garlic through, and it really does a nice job, so I'm content."
5,Awesome!,This blueray concert captured the experience. The behind the scenes footage was an extra bonus I wasn't expecting. A must have for all Sade fans.
5,HUGE Sade Fan...,"Since the '80s, I've been a huge fan of Sade, so of course I'm giving this DVD 5 stars. I've had the pleasure of seeing her last June in Baltimore, MD and there wasn't an empty seat in the entire arena---enough said. If you love Sade, then you must must MUST get this, especially if you haven't been to her concert(s)."
1,"GREG@BARTLETT, TN",THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A SONY PRODUCTION. IT CARRIES THE EPIC LOGO. I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET THE DISC TO PLAY. SADE PRODUCTIONS ARE PRODUCED BY SONY. THIS DISC IS APPARENTLY A BOOTLEG ITEM. IT ARRIVES IN HEAVY PLASTIC WRAPING. IT TOOK ME FIFTEEN MINUES TO EXTRACT THE DISC FROM THE HEAVY PLASTIC WRAPPING. BEWARE OF THIS ITEM. ONLY BUY SADE AUTHORIED SONY PRODUCTS.
5,The spectacular New Madrid Earthquake,This book was very informative about the New Madrid Earthquake. It had great detail about the earthquake and is a great resource for term papers. I would highly recommend this book to students who are doing papers for Earthscience courses with there main interest of the New Madrid Earthquake.
3,too long,"It took me two months to read this book because I kept losing interest. I enjoyed learning what happened to the Noble House, but there was too much technical babble and political intrigue. Two things I did like about it though were the two Iranian woman's stories and the fate of Robert Armstrong and Peter Mzytrk(Suslev)."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY,"If you're on any kind of low (or lower) carbohydrate program this book is a total waste of your time and money. The average carb count for ONE MEAL is at least 10-15 grams (and that's on her lower carb program.) Multiply that by three, add something for snacks, and you'll be well over your daily target.The recipes are nothing extraordinary. Even if you can't cook, you don't need a cookbook to teach you how to make oatmeal (which shouldn't even BE in a low-carb cookbook) or how to combine cut-up kiwi and berries to make a ""Kiwi Jumble.""There are several other Low-Carb cookbooks out there that are much, much better. Try Lauri's Low-Carb Cookbook or the Ultimate Low-Carb Diet Cookbook instead.This one is definitely headed for the recycling or resale stack."
2,Low carb?,"For an Atkins Nutritional Approach advocate, this recipe book is not terribly useful. Low carb to me means <30 grams of carbs. Ms Gassenheimer seems to think some recipes upward of 40 grams ""low carb"". Some of the recipes are within my parameters, but too many are not, since I need to count all 3 meals as well as any snacks in my daily consumption. I would never recommend this book."
2,"Recipes too complicated for ""fast"" meals cookbook","Although the recipes looked appetizing, I was disappointed because they looked too complicated to make on a tight time schedule, and many of the ingredients would need to be purchased at a health food store. Anything that requires the use of a food processor (especially for breakfast) is not a fast recipe in my book. The book did include some faster recipes but they were TOO basic. For example, one recipe called for a) bran cereal and b) milk. The instructions were something like: divide cereal into 2 bowls, add milk. Serves two. That seemed a little too obvious to me to be considered a ""recipe"", while the others seemed too complicated. I was hoping for a happy medium. The layout of the book is excellent though. I like the style very much. Enjoy the recipes; just don't expect to be done in minutes!"
3,Malibu barbie,"This doll has cool hair and a nice bathing suit, but personally i don't like her face. Her face looks bent in and i think she is overated in price. Her eyes don't have a lot of detail. Other than that, the packaging looks nice."
4,Great winx with real eyelashes!,"Okay,I got this doll on my 12th birthday about 5 months and 2 days ago,and it tottaly rocks!It`s my only winx that I have (I`m more into bratz and Myscene) and It`s really cool.This is a great gift for any speacail occasion!However,I DO have a complaint,And I feel bad because she is such a pretty doll with real eyelashes,but it`s the right thing to do for buyers.Once you get this doll,it`s hard to put her gloves back on.So you should think about this before you buy it."
3,"Self-serving, excellent insight into the end of a tragedy","A first-hand account of the endgame in Bosnia, To End A War left me thinking at times that Mr. Holbrooke had succumbed to the same nationalist passions and irrational behavior he went around accusing everyone else of. The book sticks to the facts, but they are not the most interesting part. What is more appealing are the inconsistencies in Holbrooke's personal beliefs, his almost racist approach and arrogance, and the revealing passages about the side in the conflict everyone had thought angelic so far. A disturbing book for a reader from the Balkans, this is nevertheless an excellent resource for examining the creation of the New Diplomacy, with all of its resplendent consequences today. One cannot understand the modern world without it. Read with extreme caution and with scrutiny. And, unlike Holbrooke, try to put your prejudices on hold before opening the covers."
5,"Good, Clean, Family Comedy","Considering I was a child in the 60's, you could understand why I became a Dick Van Dyke fan primarily to Mary Poppins as opposed to his TV show (it was the 70's when I first saw the TV show in reruns). This movie sealed me being a fan.An actor is picked up by a gang, thinking he is a vicious hit man. (If you can picture Van Dyke as a hit-man, you can see how funny this movie is.) Edward G. Robinson is excellent as a gangster who still comes across as a father figure to a point.This movie is rated G. I wish Hollywood would re-investigate this film, and see a movie about gangsters can be funny without sex and violence.By the way, this movie, one of my all-time favorite comedies, was also my introduction to pop art."
4,Cute little funny movie,"If you like Dick Van Dyke and his TV show then you will like this movie. I review a film for what it is supposed to be in my opinion and for this film it is light hearted, suspend disbelief and go with the flow fare. There are many funny spots but a few gags that go a little too long. All in all it is worth a look."
4,Handy dandy,It is compact and cuts green wood fast. I like it a lot. The only problem I have is that it is not easy to get the blade to fold back into the handle. The blade always hits the handle and I have to guide it into its slot.
3,"Churchill good, spelling bad","I am going through Churchill's volumes one by one. It seems to me that Amazon has farmed out the re-typing of his works to persons who have little knowledge of English spelling. Outer Mongolians? On almost every second page there are spelling errors that make the intended word incomprehensible, utterly spoiling the reader's enjoyment. May I suggest that Amazon employ a second typist to verify what the first has done? That is standard practice in all data processing establishments."
2,Didn't work at all for us,"To be clear - we love the regular Halo sleepsacks alone and swaddling for sleep but the combination is much less than the sum of its parts with this product. At just a few weeks old our son could wriggle down in the sack so that the velcro wings rode up over his throat and face in a way that looked pretty scary to us. We took him out of it in less than an hour and never wanted to use it again.Just seems like a really bad design to me, and unnecessary since the regular sleepsack and swaddle blankets work so well by themselves."
3,Just Average,"The Halo 2N1 itself wasn't enough to keep our baby's hands tightly swaddled. Also, the sleepsack itself tends to bunch up around the neck. While the fleece keeps baby warm, it does pill after several washings. We only use the removeable swaddle band to help swaddle w/a traditional blanket."
5,Makes swaddling super easy!,I used to have the most difficult time swaddling my son until a friend recommended this product. It made swaddling him super easy. I also love that I don't need to completely unswaddle him to change his diapers at night - helps me put him back to sleep all that more easily!
3,Sara_wil,"While at first the sleepsack seemed to work well, after a while my daughter's hands would end up poking out the bottom. The velcro only allows for the middle of the wrap to go tight causing the bottom to be open. In an ordinary blanket, this would never happen. Also, my daughter was born 8.8 lbs and quickly wasn't able to fit traditional newborn sizing. IF you you have a bigger child at birth, don't hesitate to go with the small size over the newborn. It's nice that they have the size up."
1,Dont Buy,"Please be aware. If you buy this product you ""MUST"" use long sleeves. There is a piece of Velcro inside that will cut up your child's arm if they move at all. Other than the mauling of my child, the sack swaddles pretty well."
5,Great swaddle,We really liked this swaddle. It fits snugly so our daughter wasn't able to get her arms out until she was at the top end of the weight limit for this size. Nice thick warm fleece. It definitely helped her sleep well and I'd recommend it highly.
5,Use them every night,My son has a strong startle reflex. These made him feel safe and secure and let him sleep longer at night. they are soft and he loves them.
3,Not great for swaddling,"This product has a major flaw for a baby that likes swaddling: their legs aren't swaddled! Should have thought of that looking at the product, but we didn't recognize the problem until our newborn kept startling herself awake kicking. (What can I say--first time parents!) Having the legs ""loose"" while the arms are swaddled doesn't make much sense to me now that we've had a little experience. Overall design seems very safe. The fleece is warm, but we have found that DD gets a bit clammy. We ended up purchasing Aden and Anais Muslin Swaddle Wraps and have found them to be perfect for swaddling, warm, and breathable."
3,Colorful content mixed with too much mothering,"If journalism students and historians could wade through the excessively detailed and highly dysfunctional correspondence between a manipulative W.R. Hearst and his doting mother who controlled all the purse strings until her death, they just might find something of value in this 600+ page biography. William Randolph Hearst provides an excellent study in early 20th century journalism, magazine publication, promotion, and cross-media marketing - especially when viewed against the advent of earlier technologies like radio, silent films, newsreels and major motion pictures. Undoubtedly a man for his day, W.R. Hearst parlayed all his media resources into what would later become a prototype for America's multi-media conglomerates. Very valuable for today's entrepreneurs engaged in digital and social media."
2,Skip the alphabet puzzle,"The fish and number puzzles are good. The letters puzzle is horrible. The pieces aren't in the shape of the letter. Also, the board has odd pictures for the letter. My son has no idea where the letters go....he can't match the letter with the board, and the board cut outs aren't in the shape of the letters. Awful letter puzzle."
2,Not up to M&D's usual standards,"I love Melissa and Doug products, but unfortunately this puzzle set seems to have come from their factory's ""reject"" pile. Before I even unwrapped it the images were peeling off some of the letters, but even worse was the fact that the W was missing and in its place was an upside down M! They are completely different shapes, so this kind of defeats the purpose of a shape-based puzzle like this.Overall I'm pretty disappointed."
3,good learning for kids,Product is good but quality should have been little better. I have other similar one which has better quality. Overall good though.
5,Great Puzzle,My 10 month old daughter loves these puzzles. She pulls the pieces out and tries to put them back in. The puzzles are made of wood and are very durable.
2,Boring waffle dressed up in high-falutin' language,"I agree with the Canadian reviewer. Jibber jabber. This book contains a lot of statements that are perfectly obvious to anyone with a crumb of commonsense. Dressed up in lots of fancy verbiage and selling it as a book.I give it one star more than the Canadian reviewer for the simple reason that some of the information might be useful to ladies who learn to ride later in life, if they are not very aware of their body.I was VERY disappointed in this book. Its review led me to believe I would learn philosophical truths, tricks and tips to enable me to adapt my aging body to continuing riding, and other important and useful information. Instead I read that badly-fitting saddles cause discomfort and that as I age I can expect to become less supple. Should I pay money to read that? I don't think so!"
1,Don't buy this,"I saw a product like this on vacation, which worked splendidly, and I had to have one. This is not it. I carefully chose one that took D batteries, so it would be a good size, and more powerful, but I received a smaller version that takes double A's. It is useless. Do not bother with it."
2,Underpowered compared to other raquet zappers,"Stuns flies, but does not kill them. I then have to kill them or get them out of the house before they wake back up.I've used other models at friends houses that work fine, perhaps because theirs use a 9v battery. This model uses two AA batteries, and seems way underpowered. No satisfying ""pop"" either."
1,What you see is NOT what you get,"This swatter is a piece of junk;made with very thin plastic, electric grid is made with almost tin foil material, swatter head is super flimsy, and handle is not much sturdier.The item pictured is NOT what you receive, the item is a smaller cheaper poorer version of the electric fly swatter.Harbor freight sell a much better one. Buyer beware. Even one star is too high for this piece."
3,great toy...I mean tool,not only does it kill flies but pretty much any flying insect. Works as a deterrent against small animals too. Sent my neighbors cat flying 10 feet. I suggest using new batteries and a well ventilated area in case there is smoke. No more peeing on the plants from that one. Its also very safe. The light weight yellow plastic looks like a toy so it made a great gift to my bratty nieces and nephewsI wonder why the manufacturer didn't put their name on it. Oh well. For other greats idea visit YouTube. Enjoy this great toy.-Despicable me
2,Disappointed,"First of all, I received a different item that pictured. Mine was red, had a stencil of a bug in the middle, and was small, only about 6"" in diameter. One out of two didn't work so I am sending them back and ordering something else."
1,Sure miss,"My husband hit the fly with it several times and the swatter did nothing to it. The fly kept on flying. Others were right, the plastic is cheap and brittle, the hanging hook was broken by the time we got to it and it's never worked once. It was broken and defective from the first use. Now I'm trying to work with Amazon about a return."
2,Great as long as you do not drop it....,I definitely needed this product except I dropped it (not very hard either) on the laminate floor and now it won't work.Shame...
1,Cheap piece of crap,"This piece of crap broke the moment I took it out of the package. However, I'm sure it will live on for eternity in a landfill."
5,It seems each is unique and I'm happy with mine,"The price on these things seems to fluctuate. I paid $5.55 a few weeks ago. Since then I've seen it for over $10 and now it's around $6. The one in the picture has a yellow button and mine is black. I've bought similar products in the past and this one is built much more solidly (given it's $2 worth of plastic and wire).Bottom line from the one I received and the more recent comments I've read is the design is good, the quality control can be a bit spotty, and when you get a good one it works well. (I got a good one)These things will do a fine job zapping small insects, fly-sized and smaller. I wouldn't try it on something like a wasp as you might just make it mad. Also, don't be limited to flying insects. If you can get a spider, for example, to crawl on the thing it will zap them quite nicely too. I find that preferable to smashing them because zapping doesn't leave a mark on the wall."
2,Not for office spaces,"I brought this because in our offices they leave the windows open and the mosquitoes swarms right in. This electronic zapper has so far killed no mosquitoes, but it has zapped me once (so I know it works!) I've attempted to use it multiple times but because of its bulky nature it's not effective to swing around unless you have open spaces all around you. Also I swear I see the flies go right through the three layered grid without it ever touching the metal."
1,Does not work,"This product is terrible. The current is really weak, so there is a relatively long delay before the flies die. During this time, they can just fly away to safety.A regular fly swatter is much more effective."
3,Good Deal on Basic Zapper,"Ordered 2 or these at different times when the price is right, and got 2 different revisions. Overall good quality.My Stars Rating: 1NOTSatisfied - 2SlightlyDissatisfied - 3Satisfied - 4BetterThanAverage - 5VERYSatisfied"
1,Very ineffective,"I guess I should have known by the price that I was getting low quality. I've used similar devices in the past, so I'm familiar with what they can do. This model is very ineffective. Sure, I'm trying to zap fruit flies, and they're a bit smaller than most other insects you zap, but this gadget still only zaps about 5% of the flies I target."
4,Viewer discretion advised!,"This thing works, but it is pretty scary and for us ""not-so-wild-about-bugs"" types, it is kind of disturbing to use. Just beware - you are actually brutally shocking bugs to their death. I know, obvious, but it is quite graphic when you actually do it for the first time. I gave 4 stars because it seems a little cheaply made - I would like to see a rubber handle (feels like I am getting a little current in my hand when I turn it on) and a child-safety lock on the engage button. Just keep out of reach of children!"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This is a good sounding 'gimick'! Unfortunately, it doesn't work unless the bug stands still when you bring the charged wire mesh 'racket' in contact with the bug! Not so easy since flies tend to move rather quickly when something gets near them...!"
1,Lentek Biteshield RZ02 Electronic Racket Zapper,"This product did not work at all. When we first got it, it zapped ONE fly to the ground, not killing it but stunning it momentarily so you may then kill it with a tissue. After that it never zapped again, the flies just flew into it and kept going. I would not suggest this product to anyone. We bought one last year from the super market and it worked all year, we just couldn't find them this year."
1,Keep It Simple Stupid!,"This was a waste of money. Glad it was not real expensive or I would be really upset rather than just mildly irritated. I have not been able to kill a single fly with this thing, though I have been able to shock myself once. I did this during an attempt to see if something was wrong with the device and was not even pressing the ON button.Stay away and buy a flyswater."
3,Zapper for larger bugs.,"The little pesky bugs go right through it, but it is still a thrill to zap the full grown variety!"
2,"Works, but poorly designed","The thing works. However... It's not as spectacular as my last electric swatter. The old one used to fry bugs to a crisp with a loud pop. This one just electrocutes them without any noise. Ok, it will probably last longer this way. It's just so badly designed... the battery cover when closed will torque the battery contacts just enough to make something lose contact inside. The button is dead. When I leave the cover off, it works. :/ It's a good thing the batteries are in there tight...I would not buy this again."
2,Not as good as single wire sreen,Has center screen (3 total) that needs contact to zap fly. Even when this does happen the zap is weak. Not impressive but does work once the fly gets to the center screen.
4,Cool Gadget,I can't say I've eliminated the worlds bug population but my forehand and backhand stroke reflexes are really coming along. I recommend it. It makes a cool gift too.
1,Disappointing product,"I have owned fly zapping rackets in the past and had great success with them, unfortunately this particular model seems to lack any type of electric current or quality whatsoever. It basically fell apart into pieces, didn't kill flys, and ended up in the trash. I would recommend finding a better quality bug zapper."
3,Not too happy 4 year old!,I got this for my daughter's 4th birthday. She was so excited when she saw it! We put batteries in it and were every unhappy after that moment. The reason we were unhappy is because it was a spanish speaking one. I guess Mattel didn't mark the boxes to tell you what language it spoke in.(how was I supposed to know since everything on the box and the instructions were all in english)I called the store where we bought it and they didn't have anymore since it is discontinued. I did get ahold of Mattel and they are taking care of it. So just beware if you come across one of these. Other than that my daughter loves it!
1,the still,"not very dicriptive,and only says how to make one kind of still. and you need all the things he had for the still and some of those things are hard to come by"
3,Made in ???,"Really thought I was going to love my new German made kitchen gadget.... it turns out to be made in China! Shame on Rosle for putting their name on something of lesser quality & yet still charging a premium price. Oh, by the way ordered the replacement wires & those were still made in Germany! If I wanted to go the Chinese route I could have just gone to Wal -Mart. Please correct the "" made in"" part of the description."
2,Needs improvement,"The earlier review got it right - sounds like a great idea and looks very nice, but with no turntable and very low clearance [I have a tall coffee mug that cannot be reheated in this microwave], its not very practical. The food really does cook unevenly and you must stop and turn it several times. We had a bag of microwave popcorn that burned before it was close to completely popping. It looks like the microwave of the future, but works like a microwave from 1985. It also is very loud when it runs.If you really don't use a microwave often and want something that looks great, I wouldn't rule this out. Otherwise wait until they work out the kinks."
4,"lot of suspens, and surprises","Once I started I couldn't stop. This book gives a great lot more intrigue than the usual historical romance would give. Evangeline will, make you laugh, make you mad, and make you sad; in just this one book. And the duke is just so different from the usual aristocrat, so expressive, that you'll want to keep on reading hours after hours. This is one of the best of Coulter's books I have read to this day."
3,Lacking the Poetic,"I have a website for introverts, [...] and get thousands of emails from infps all over the world. I would say this is a pretty accurant description, maybe not quite modest or poetic enough! A true infp would probably be using a lot of metaphors to create a beautiful image or feeling of what they experienced."
1,Is there anybody?,"I've been waiting for this book for months! But I've always got the same THIS-TITLE-IS-CURRENTLY-NOT-AVAILABLE message. I've been checking this page too occasionally, with very disappointing results.I've LEARNED PS HRMS WITHOUT OXRIDER, but still keep looking if there is anybody behind it. Just a matter of curiosity.Maybe I decide writting it myself, so other people don't suffer the same."
3,Needs Improvements! (My name is OI),"This is a great compilation, but it still needs some things. What about U&I from Forever My Lady? That's was a soul classic. They forgot ""Let's Go Through The Motions"", from the Who's The Man Soundtrack. They also forgot ""Come To My Room"" from The Murder Was The Case album from Death Row Records.The single version of LAtley should be on here instead of the live version, and 2pac's How Do U Want It is missing."
4,Better throughput than a P4,This cost effective dual processor setup is easier to install and has better overall throughput for multitasking than my P4 3.0ghz. I am going to use it as a webserver. I would have given it a 5 star but the IDE controller went out in less than 2 years.
4,"World's best peeler, but made in China","It's really a matter of pride. If you design such a nice thing, but don't care about overseeing it being made, then you're just a trader maximizing profits. Enjoy your wealth, Rösle, but you suck. I hope your contract factory steals your design and clones it for $12.It peels very well, and I wanted it because the blade can be sharpened. That simple feature gives it the potential of lasting for years and years.China isn't necessarily a black hole for good things. If I were going to buy a Chinese cleaver I would get a Chinese made CCK cleaver rather than a lame Wustoff or Dexter-Russell one. That's just the way it is."
4,Meth,"I used this to make rocky candy as meth for a costume prop. I dressed as Hiesenburg from Breaking Bad. It does work, I used two drops, but you have to be careful. Because boiling sugar, corn syrup and hot water makes a yellowish color, adding too little, too much or stirring too much can change to a green color. Took me three tries (first Americolor Sky Blue, second McKormick Neon Blue and third Americolor Sky Blue again), but I got it eventually."
5,Gloworms!,"When I was little, I had several Gloworms and I'm thrilled they still make them so I can purchase them for cousins. They are very reassuring for an infant, the soft glow soothes them to sleep. I also do agree with some of the other reviews, Gloworm is quite a bit smaller than I remember. But it's still a comforting toy for an infant"
3,Broken Bridle,"My daughter got this from Santa. When she opened the box she found the bridle was broken. Beyond that, this item is typical Barbie--plastic, lightweight, fragile, and overpriced."
3,Came dented and smashed,This product arrived usable but I was disappointed becasue it was all dented in on one side.The birds didn't mind but I guess I expected better packing.
4,Enough if you have experience with Windows 95,"I used this book and i passed the exam in three weeks. However it needs some improvement in Networking and System Policies. Some chapters should be removed, because they are no tested anymore. Thaks Ed."
4,Home Depot must love this guy.,"Nuts and bolts filmmaking is an excellent resource for students and no-budget filmmakers. If you're prepared to use your hands and don't mind that your rigging may not have the pro look to it, the techniques in this book are solid."
2,Not made for American spice jars,"We recently purchased a set of Rösle racks from another on-line retailer.That web site did not offer the double spice rack, and now I think I know why. We ordered the spice rack from Amazon.com, and when it arrived, our first impression was that it was beautiful, and solidly made. Unfortunately, when we tried to test it out with spice jars from our cupboard, none of them fit on the bottom shelf of the rack. We tried the shortest jars in our cupboard, and only the half-height sampler jars fit. The top shelf holds only 7 jars. Because of the very poor capacity of the rack, we will be returning it."
4,Inexpensive exercise tool,"I found this to be a inexpensive way to get exercise I need. It doesn't take up much room, you could even put in a closet. Bring out when you are ready to exercise. The cost compare to most of the exerciser that are advertise, makes it more affordable."
1,Junk,"This thing has a free-wheeling action and offers no resistent. When I screwed down the ""resistence"" knob, it rubbed -metal on metal, it seems - for a second. What a waste of money and time."
5,Arms workout,"This is a good way to exercise your arms and get an aerobic workout. I broke my hip and wanted something for exercise other than slow walking.It's a sturdy unit and it doesn't heat up when I use it. I also tried using it for peddling with my feet, but didn't like that so much. The movement is jerky with foot peddling (the jerkiness is hardly noticeable with arm peddling). Also, with foot peddling, if you have large feet your heelsmay hit against the bar in back if you don't sit at just the right angle."
2,Not very good at adjusting level of difficulty of workout,"If you just want to move your muscles then its fine. I would not recommend it for workout. The knob at the top loosens and even when I tighten it, it doesn't seem to increase the resistance of paddles. Unimpressive."
3,tension adjustment weak,"I've had this exerciser for about a year. Right away the side round silver holders came off and continue to come off, but the biggest drawback in the gear for adjusting the tension on how hard it pedals is so weak that it cracked and fails to work. On the plus side, I like how light it is and can be carried around wherever you decide to exercise."
1,Not the best,"Had issues assembling the product. The hole threads were not cut, therefore not able to screw the unit together. Quality is what you pay for. Be warned."
3,Good for its price,"Metal near the pedal do heat up after 30 minutes of use, otherwise, it is good product."
3,It does the job!,"It does the job it supposed to do, I only wish it was built a little sturdier. But if your therapy should only last a few months this one is perfect."
4,Very Satisfied,"I purchased this product for my 88 year old visually impaired father. As he was no longer able to safely climb onto his stationary bike, and since he needs and enjoys the exercise, the Stamina Cycle is perfect. I highly recommend it for people with limited mobility."
1,Not usable!,"Sorry, but I had to return this item. Although the quality of the materials and workmanship were fine, the design made it impossible to use.When trying to pedal my heels would hit the bottom support, no matter how I tried to prevent that. The pedals need to be made higher off the floor."
5,Awesome,"This product is light, user friendly, gets the job done and affordable. Plus it is easy to assemble. Highly recommend."
3,The Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XL Fairly good deal,"This is my second Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XL. My first one was a gift from my mom. I am not able to walk very much, so she bought me this 'bike' to help me get exercise. I used it every day for over 2 years. Then one day it broke. The 'axel' or whatever the part is called came unwelded under the stress of use. I felt that the price was well worth the use of it for 2 years, so I ordered one for myself.The unit tends to move away from you as you peddle, so I braced it against a stationary prop so that it wouldn't slide away as I peddled. I was able to sit on the end of my bed and peddle for as long as I wanted. I do like this unit, and if this one lasts me at least as long as the last one did, I will be happy with it."
2,You Get What You Pay For- Not Much,"""You get what you pay for"" is an appropriate description for this inexpensive, primitive mini-cyle. I should have heeded the concerns as expressed by previous buyers of this product from Amazon. Positives: the Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XL is cheap and assembly instructions are clear and easy. Negatives: it produces an unbearably loud squeek when in operation and it won't stay in one place. Regardless of the surface, the vinyl leg caps twisted around and the cycle crept forward as I pedaled. Fortunately Amazon has a no-fuss return policy so I packed it up and returned it the next day."
4,Exercise Cycle Pedals,"The Stamina 15-0120 Exercise Cycle is built to last. It is simple, strong, and easy to use. I recommend the Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XL to anyone who needs this type of stationary exercise equipment."
1,Feedback,UNIT LOOKS A LOT BETTER THAN SIMILAR ITEMS I'VE SEEN. I TRIED IT OUT AND IT WORKS OK. NOW IF I COULD JUST MY WIFE TO TRY IT BECAUSE THAT'S WHO I BOUGHT IT FOR.
4,good deal,"This works out great for me, I can read, watch TV,or just look out the window while I exercise. I checked all around so I know the price is right so it's a good deal for me. My Brother saw it and ordered one right away."
4,Great little tool,"Bought this item as recommended by a weight loss surgeon as a easy option to get started on exercise. Very sturdy and easy to use ~ yes, it can get very hot so don't try to move it right away when finished. Has come in very handy when ice and snow prevented walks outside."
2,Loud and annoying,"This thing gets VERY loud squeak after about 10 min. The resistance is a joke, and the thing moves around all over. I won't give it one star because it does work, when you can get it to sit still...but not worth the money!"
1,not for anyone with size 10 shoes!,"kind of chincy, if your shoe size is bigger than 9, you can not wear shoes and try to ues this!"
3,Strictly for fans of June Anderson Only,"I was very disappointed with this DVD. June was no Norma. Her recitatives were undramatic and tentative, and her singing uninspired. The Pollione by Shin Young Hoon was much worse, he has a small voice, and the two have absolutely no chemistry at all. Only Barcellona as Adalgisa and the Oroveso (can't remember his name) saved the day. The period orchestra under Biondi sounded thin, like a stage band."
2,"Slow in places, but okay","Claire Marsh is like many parents, newly divorced, looking for job and trying to raise Zoe. Between the karate, play dates with Zoe's young Claire herself now trying her luck at dating again with Fireman Dennis, who saves Claire.Okay, this book looked like some some light hearted fun that would be good to read during lunch break. But,in places this book just dragged on. It was an okay read, but it was to long."
5,Very Insightful!,"I enjoyed this book an awful lot! It made me smile so many times! A very good portrait of a Mom-child relationship for those who are thinking of becoming a parent. And for those who already are parents - well, it serves as another reminder of how great and rewarding it is to be one."
5,From an Urban Mom...,"As a mother with two children in NYC's fast-paced private school arena, I was delighted to read Leslie Carroll's Play Dates. With wit, warmth and well-placed satire, she captures the essence of the social and academic pressures faced by both parents and children in this competitive scene. I can't imagine a mother who cannot find a bit of herself or her child in this book. I recommended it to a number of friends at my daughter's school, and they all found it thoroughly delightful. It is a refreshing, urban fairy tale for grown-ups that will bring a smile to your face no matter how stressful your day."
4,Almost two separate movies: but this is well worth watching,"I was comfortably watching one ""genre"" of movie when it grew and became more complex. This is a great cinematic story, but one which requires you to sit and follow regardless --- it is not what you are expecting. Nonetheless, by the end you have been gifted a powerful and comprehensive view of life in Beijing.Social class; town-country; hutongs-new development; traditional work vs new business; youth conflict; youth solidarity; and incoming western consumer selfishness. What a Beijing buffet this is; suspenseful, touching, sometikes brutal. Watch it."
5,Buy 2 copies - 1 for a friend,"There is no greater telling of the story of Bernadette Soubirous and Our Lady of Lourdes. A classic which will never be surpassed. Future movie makers may tell the story in a different or more dramatic way, but no one will make a greater film than this. I don't know how many times I have watched this movie, but it affects me deeply each time."
1,Non-working DVD,"DVD doesn't work - mymachine says ""Region Code Error"". Tried 3 other machines and get same note. Got it as was a Christmas gift for a sick friend who was very excited to get it and then disappointed it didn't work. If this is a foreign type DVD should be noted and want one that works. What do I do now?"
5,Thank you,This movie was a favorite of mine as a child; my daughter saw it on t.v. a few weeks ago and liked it so I got it for her for a Christmas gift. She should love it. Well acted.

4,"This is a fine, beautiful book","I use this book frequently. The pictures are beautiful and the recipes delicious. I have not had anything out of this book that I did not like. A previous reviewer claims that this is not a vegetarian book because it is not vegan. That is opinion, don't go by that review! The author points out that vegetarian cheeses are available. My only issue with this book is that many of the recipes are high in fat and there is no nutritional analysis. Otherwise, when I am not counting calories, I love this book!"
2,low-budget knockoff,"Warning: track 4, whose actual title is ""Deep in Blue"" has a vocal by Irene Daye, not Anita O'Day. I suspect the producers did not actually listen to their product.Anita O'Day is fabulous. Music lovers who want her 1940s stuff would be better off buying Sony/Columbia/Legacy's ""Let Me Off Uptown: The Best Of Anita O'Day""Let Me Off Uptown: The Best of Anita O'Day with Gene Krupaor Proper's comprehensive box set ""Young Anita""Young Anita.Then after you become addicted to her voice, try Avid's ""Four Classic Albums""Four Classic Albums, from the 1950s. All three of these collections are well produced, terrific bargains, and available from Amazon as of July 2010.A wonderful biographical documentary DVD with bonus disk of performances is ""Anita O'Day - The Life Of A Jazz Singer""Anita O'Day - The Life Of A Jazz Singer."
3,"Nice performance, but this is one of Offenbach's weakest","Nice performance, quite entertaining, but this is one of Offenbach's weakest compositions. It is by far less quality than his last one ""The Tales of Hoffman"". In the present Operetta one can see Offenbach's mediocrity, rather than his genius that was exposed only later.Natalie Dessay's performance, though is worth watching. ... and the last half an hour becomes very catchy."
5,Enjoyable sociology,"On the back cover we are told that sociologist Njeri Mbugua ""takes us inside an African society rarely discussed,"" creating a ""profound yet humorously narrated story [that] demonstrates the restorative power of love and faith in the face of greed and cruelty."" As a fellow sociologist who reads work that usually puts one to sleep within minutes, I was a little worried that ""Joki"" would go down the same road. I'm very happy to report that I was wrong, as in addition to having me hooked and rooting for Joki from page one, Mbugua also very nicely weaves sociological insights into the narrative. It is a rare treat when an author can both entertain and educate us, especially in a post-9/11 world. Thank you, Njeri Mbugua!"
1,Test of Endurance,"This was a really difficult movie to watch. In fact, I gave up on it twice and only returned to it for the sake of completing something I had started. It certainly wasn't the LGBT theme that made the movie difficult to watch, but it was bad acting, a story line that doesn't feel like it was actually written by a lesbian, the tempo of the film was incredibly slow, and the cast weren't people I could connect with. This is one of the worst movies I've ever watched! If you're looking for a good lesbian themed movie, I would suggest you save your time and money with this one and look for something by Nicole Conn."
3,NOT ROAN'S BEST!!!!!,"It's interesting to see this version of Light of the Western Stars. However, Roan's print is not that great and not up to par with most of their releases. This early Paramount western was one of their features re-issued in the 50's. The opening and ending titles have been replaced. The replacement title on this DVD is ""Winning the West"". There is no explanation on the disc regarding this issue, so I do not know if any better prints exist. Other than the titles, the feature does not appear edited as it runs its original running time of 70 min. In response to the other reviewer, the man on the front cover is Victor Jory. Roan also screwed up the cover by using pictures from the 1940 version. In summary, if this is the best available, I can excuse it. But Roan needs to offer an explanation so that we know what's going on."
4,the best fit I could find,"I had trouble getting the most out of my pumping sessions with the standard 24mm breastshield. I got the 21mm, sadly they don't make one even smaller (that I could find), as I think that would help me to gather even more milk, but the 21mm helped me to get more milk than before. I still find getting a lot out of my pumping sessions, even after going 7 hours w/o nursing, is tough. :o( If only I could JUST nurse all the time."
4,Brand New and Fast shipment!!!,Came brand New and had very Fast shipment!!! Great buy to go with my Medela Pump for the next baby!
2,Personal Fit... not so much,"I hated this product. My problem is that I have extremely large breasts, but small nipples. I was told that I needed smaller breast shield for the nipple size, but this breast shield wasn't even large enough to fit around my breast. I have absolutely no suction with this product. Whoever created the sizes was clearly a man because they corresponded the size of the inner whole for nipple with the size of the shield. The smaller the breast, the smaller the nipple. The larger the breast, the larger the nipple. Not necessarily the case. I bought the small, medium, large, and extra large breastshield and none of them fit correctly. The only thing I like about them is that they can be disconnected from all the other pieces."
2,Poor fit to adapter,"I think the tunnel diameter is a good fit for my nipple, but the shield is very small (not meant for large breasts, I suppose) and the tunnel LENGHT is ridiculously small. It hardly stays on the adapter. The adapter w/milk receptacle falls off if you don't stay still. I tend to shift positions, or reach for a magazine while pumping. I'm going back to the mediums."
3,No adequate for lifting wood joist under house.,Delivered on time. Plate bent when trying to lift joist under house to level sagging floor. Not strong enough to lift that kind of weight. Held okay with upgraded metal plate and after house lifted with bottle jack. Product would work for less weight or maybe if pushing on firmer surface.
1,Doesn't clean dishes at all,"I had been very pleased with Meyer's products, especially the basil scented all purpose cleaner and cleansing powder. This product is awful. Dishes do not come clean, even if I rinse prior to washing. I called Meyer's to see if they would offer a coupon for another product since I was very disappointed. They increased my disappointment by acknowledging the the product doesn't work at all on tea or coffee stains but didn't offer anything other then ""return it to the store you bought it from"". terrible customer service"
3,"Smells fantastic, but requires prewashing by hand","I tried this dishwasher detergent in geranium and I must say... it smells heavenly. Unfortunately I am not one who prewashes my dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, and this only did a so-so job on actually cleaning the dishes. Not terrible, but some dishes (particularly those that held anything oily) were left with a faint, whiteish film."
2,Ideas and Options in English for Specific Purposes,"Ideas and Options in ESP is a pedestrian treatment of the field. It is theory poor, even for a book of its vintage."
1,More Info. needed,"This group had I believe at least two releases the self titled release and the After Dark Release,with no song list or cover art how is a buyer supposed to know which relaese you are selling?"
3,Don't like the laces,"So the shoes are absolutely adorable, very comfortable and look great. But maybe I just don't know how to tie those shoe laces or something. They are a pain. I thought that since we don't wear dress shoes every day, it wouldn't be bad to have shoes with laces (most of our others are with velcro), but these are particularly a hassle...unfortunately."
4,What the world may be coming to,This book is quick reading and gets your mind flowing. It has great character developement and is exciting from start to finish!! Just read the prologue and you'll be hooked on this book!
5,Mind Blowing,"WOW - to date Sabbath created the heaviest 2 albums ever made and you think to yourself - where do they go from here? Well the answer becomes sickeningly obvious soon enough - they create an even more powerful sound and attitude.Are you kidding me? Right from the first seconds of `Sweet Leaf' - Sabbath show the world they are the innovators of the heaviest sound ever. The first 2 albums were metal and all - but they were blues based and Sabbath was still finding themselves. On this 3rd outing - the heavens opened and out poured the heaviest blobs of doom imaginable.Pure timeless boundless heaviness. Every second of this album is perfect. Inventors of stoner metal, doom metal, heavy metal - every metal. Sabbath is beyond the shackles of mankind on this album - they have progressed to some other-worldy existence of perfection."
5,MY FAVORITE ONE!!!,"After many many years listening to SABBATH, i think MASTER OF REALITY is the one i love the most!!!The album cover is magnificient, the songs got brilliant riffs and lyrics and the SABBATH menbers shine heavily!!!The opener SWEET LEAF got one of the most powerful riffs of the world...INTO THE VOID is great, as is LORD OF THIS WORLD...AFTER FOREVER and CHILDREN OF THE GRAVE are great too...MASTER OF REALITY is a masterpiece...A perfect heavy metal album and is part of my life!!!!"
5,Another masterpiece,Ozzy is a God. Amazing vocals and very warm feelings by the music. The first five albums with Ozzy are all amazing and will last eternally. It the something that makes this album unique. You can hear this album many times without getting bored. The original Black Sabbath are one of the master bands in the world and in the metal scene. Personally i liked very much the ballad Solitude -> its a unigue ballad (i haven't heard anything like this.)
5,The best Black Sabbath album ever,"I think Master of Reality stands out as one of the greatest metal albums ever. Ozzy sold out to the media after this was recorded i believe. Ozzy isn't even worth talking about anymore, but there was a time when he was the singer for a great band. That band was Black Sabbath.Also, you cant beat the price amazon sells it for, so pick it up if you don't have this CD. you'll be glad you did."
4,hours upon hours of classic fun,i purchased this item as a christmas gift for a friend. im too young myself to remember the show but my friend use to watch it when it was on tv i believe it was friday nights or saturday mornings. anyway even though it came after christmas my friend was totally thrilled with this completed set and now is planning show nights where we both can just hang out for a few hours to chill and watch classic tv shows. i love tv shows that were on tv before i was born and just from reading the back covers im pretty sure the Avengers is going to become one of my classic tv favorites.
3,Can't use what they don't provide!,"Great looking mount and certainly appears it will be more than adequate, however the mounting instructions assert I MUST use the ""multi-washers"" (rectangle piece of metal w/several holes in it) to attach the mounts to the back of the TV. Fine by me, but there were NONE included with the mount and I am looking for these now, or need to find/make a suitable substitute!"
1,Don't buy it!,"Like the other reviews have said, this monitor beeps at random for no apparent reason. Last night we spent the evening (again) trying to determine the reason it was beeping to no avail. Our daughter was sleeping peacefully while we were up w/the monitor! The pet sensor is great, but the random beeping ruins the monitor's advantages. If you want to sleep, I wouldn't recommend this monitor."
2,Not worth the money,this is a very expensive monitor and it is not worth the cost. It has given us trouble from the beginning. It makes the parent finder alarm sound randomly and usually at night when we are trying to get some sleep. The pet detection goes off at any time so we don't even use it. I called Evenflo and asked for a replacement and the one they sent to us had even more problems. They ended up just letting me keep both so I guess they know that the problems cannot be fixed.
1,Amazing clarity -- if it just didn't malfunction!,"Initially, I was blown away by the sound clarity of this monitor -- crystal clear, captures every moan and sigh, no static whatsoever. Unfortunately, it began malfunctioning just after the warranty expired, sounding odd alarms in the middle of the night. What started as a once or twice a night occurrence quickly degenerated into 20 or 30 wakeups a night. Oddly enough, no problems ever during the day. (I eventually found that the electric blanket seemed to be contributing to the problem, but even with that off, we continued to get hourly wakeup calls.) After several frustrating weeks of unplugging every appliance we could think of in turn to prevent interference, we bought another monitor. The sound isn't as clear, but no more nighttime wakeups! BTW, the pet sensor ended up being completely useless. If interested in this monitor, I'd just buy the basic version and save $20."
1,Wish I could give it ZERO STARS!,"This monitor is horrible! As for any good reviews all I can say is that those people must have just started using the monitor. I really liked it when I first got it, too. But then it started going off randomly. I wrote to Evenflo and they said I must have a faulty parent unit. They were vary nice and sent me a new one right away. It malfunctioned the first night!!! The clarity is incredible when you first use it. So much so that we actualy had to turn on a sound machine in our daughter's room so we didn't hear every breath she took, but the alarm (NOT THE PET DETECTION SENSOR, THEY ARE DIFFERENT SOUNDS!) goes off for no reason, sometimes 6 times a night. This product will be great once Evenflo admits it is flawed and fixes the random alarm problem. I was impressed with its initial performance, but please, new parents have enough trouble sleeping without adding this random alarm clock to the bedside table!"
1,This monitor is a huge disappointment,The evenflo Whisper connect Sensa....what a piece of junk. I watch my grandaughter everyday and can no longer use this piece of junk monitor. Why? Simple. The finder beeper goes off constantly! Sometimes many times in a row! I'm going out tomorrow and buy another one and am recommending to any and all to stay away from this product! There is no sense in spending this much money on a monitor and having it be so annoying that you refuse to use it! I just keep checking on her the old fashioned way.
1,Heretical,"This bible as far as the commentary goes should be considered heretical. For instance the commentator of the book of Esther considers the book three seperate tales combined to make historical points but cannot be proved to be historically true. So far this has made me uncomfortable with this Bible being one of my main sources of study. Although this Bible seems to be very scholarly in its content reaserched seemingly thoroghly, giving good information. It seems that the contributors are attempting to undermine divine inspiration of the Bible. This study Bible must be used always with other study Bibles sound in its doctrine."
3,"A good, basic travel guide","I just took this book to Amsterdam. I found it to be very helpful. The books features maps dedicated to a single subject (such as a restaurant map, a hotel map, etc.). We used these extensively. The Frommer's Irreverent Guides have more candid and entertaining reviews (including information on coffeeshops, which this book essentially skips), but this book is an excellent one-stop source of travel information. If you're only bringing one guide to Amsterdam, this one will do the job well. If you can pack two, bring along the Irreverent Guide (or something similarly hip)."
4,A good read for a night or two,"This book was exciting enough. It enthralled me for several nights. I got into the charactors, and my mind was gone for hours and hours while I read. The charactors are all dark. You really can't root for any charactor in the book, bacause they all have so many flaws. The mobster is a great charactor, but, he is a mobster after all, and enjoys hurting people. The gypsy's are made out as rogues. They are told to be unfeeling and rough, and only caring for themselves. There is no happiness, or goodness in this tale and that is why I liked it so much. Not everything turns out well if we wish it so. I would have given the book 5 stars, except I didn't like the ending. Oh, don't get me wrong, it goes well with the wishy washy charactor. I was just expecting something else is all. I read it, then put the book down, and said to myself, ""That's how he's going to end this book?...Odd!"". If you like Mr King, then you should, keyword being should, like this book."
3,Yawn,"K I thought this book was ok, but it needed more action. All it was talking about Billy's adventures. No gore, no action, no a lot of suspense. I felt that it was really slow and didn't keep me interested. The ending got pretty good, which is why I give it 3 stars, but I don't think that this was King's best book. It was short, which was a plus, but overall, boring and unable to hold me."
4,What happens next?!,"I loved this book. The beginning was great, the middle was great, the end was great (although there were a few changes I would have made pertaining to the stupid throbbing pie deal). I do wish that the disappointment of him deciding to do what he did in the last few sentances could have been done without, but what's upsetting to me may have been a wonderful suspenseful ending to another person. I really liked the way that it was exciting to follow the progress (or degress, rather) and to find out if he was just going to waste away or what."
2,Blantant rip off of an early 1970's horror comic,I've read a few of King's books; although I wouldn't call myself a fan. I had heard somewhere along the line that he got some of his ideas from old horror comics. I simply had no idea of the extent. There is no originality whatsoever to this book
3,"Not very scary, but highly interesting",This book was okay. I had trouble putting it down although I was disappointed by the ending
5,Good..But ending was lousy,"Alright, King. I know you're out there, reading these. The plot was great, how everything happens. I love your writing style, even though I am only 12. Problem: the ending sucked! He goes through all that hell..Just to suicide? Please please do better next time"
1,"Not Scary, Not Interesting, Don't Buy It.","Okay, here goes. A gypsy witch, metabolic imbalance, pies, etc. etc. etc. C'mon. After the age of sixteen, this stuff isn't scary anymore, only humorous. I've always considered King an engaging writer who spins a good yarn, but the only story of his that's every truly frightened me was ""Grandmother"", a short story from his collection ""Skeleton Crew"". Thinner isn't even an interesting story (ala the Bachman books or any of his early work). Leave the book at the bookstore. Don't touch! Bad reader!"
4,A good book that will keep you reading,"So many people in today's world want to lose weight and do, but what happens when you are losing too much weight at a deadly rate? It all started when Layer, Billy Halleck, the main character hits an old gypsy woman with his car and kills her. Shortly after this accident, Billy and his wife, Heidi, see an old gypsy man. This man brushes Billy's face and whispers the word ""Thinner."" From this point on Billy loses more and more weight that starts to scare him to death. He just might die if he doesn't find the cure in time. Will he survive? This book is pretty good over all and I would give it four stars. Stephen King has written some good books including Roadwork, Carrie, The Shinning, and The Green Mile. I would say that Thinner was one of his better books. The book is a little slow in parts but it interesting most of the time. I would recommend it to all readers, because I though the ending was really surprising. Enjoy!"
5,Great,Thrilling. Good ending. Twisted. A lot of things I did not expect. Some things I did not want to happen. But good
3,Kind of slow,"Only my second King novel-I started with Green Mile which is superb. I felt Thinner was just too slow and it's the first book I have ever actually skimmed through at times. The last 75 pages or so made up for the slow parts but the book is only 318 pages to begin with.For those who do not know, the book is centered around a gypsy curse which is placed on the man that kills the gypsy's daughter. The man sees the gypsy outside the courthouse and the gypsy whispers thinner as he caresses the mans cheek. Mr. Halleck loses a very large amount of weight-around 120lbs. Everyone, including family, thinks he is losing his mind when he mentiones the curse. Therefore Mr. Halleck must search for the gypsy to try and reverse the curse. The story begins to pick-up pace when Halleck contacts a mob friend to help.Would have given 3.5 stars if the choice was there."
2,This book is a reason to support book-burnings . . .,"Under normal circumstances, I would hail Stephen King as a great writer, at least within his own genre. He's imaginative, original and intelligent. But, ""Thinner"" was a horrible excuse for a book. It was written more like a bad TV-movie than a story to be enjoyed by his legions of loyal fans. Perhaps if the last half of the book wasn't spent chasing the Gypsies Matlock-style it wouldn't have been so bad. Needless to say, I was entirely bored with Halleck and Ginelli's shenannigans(sp?). Furthermore, I think Stephen King should watch his ethnic stereotypes. All this book needed to validate it as a piece of dog turd was the tiresome cliche that Ginelli was: a gangland-killer. What-EVER, Mr. King. Your white-guy-makes-good status is getting to your head."
3,"Not the best, but enjoyable.","""Thinner"", more than some of the other King fiction I've read, is a fun book. Yes, it's gruesome, and yes the end is a downer--but it's also a clever, darkly comic exploration of classism, vanity, loyalty, and the danger of passing the buck. Though the book noticeably slows in the middle, and the characters are mostly threadbare and unsympathetic, the ending may get you thinking at length about the guilt and innocence--exactly when *is* murder wrong, or vengeance unjustified?All in all, a good book."
5,Of Course,"I will forever have confidence in Ubiquity to bring it correctly. This album of wonderfully souled out covers is no exception. Worth it for the first track alone! Powerful to say the least. As the liner notes query: ""Has Woody Guthrie ever sounded so funky?"" I think not."
3,What happened to the editor?,"This book is kind of hard to read. It is full of misspelled words and jumbles of letters. Maybe i got a bad copy, but I don't know why it was so poorly put together."
3,Start well...,"I had previously enjoyed other tiles from Ms Spencer and expected to enoy this one. And I did to start with. However the inconsistent plotting, many hanging threads, two dimensional characters started to pall quickly.I rather suspect that this book was a first effort from Ms Spencer that's been sitting in a drawer somewhere and was recently dug out and published on the strength of her other works.It's an ok read if you have low expectations."
2,So-So,"I started Tinker and really enjoyed the world-building. But I found the story lagging a bit and the protagonist Tinker to be extremely annoying. Perhaps if Tink were older and more mature I could deal with this character. But a millionaire teenager who owns her own junkyard and whom adults all over go to for advice? It was just too much. Tinker was the ultimate Mary Sue. WAY too perfect. The romance between Tink and Windwolf also skeeved me out. Tink just seemed a little too immature for a serious relationship and Windwolf while a hunky guy to be sure, didn't seem the perfect mate for Tinker.2 stars."
3,"Sex, rape and bestiality","Be forewarned this book contains detailed narrative of sex, rape and bestiality. Why the author felt it necessary to include these shocking scenes is beyond my understanding, since the book is otherwise entertaining. The sex scenes alone might have been acceptable for a mature adolescent. But the rape of the protagonist was too much, as was the sadistic, bestial rape of a another character. I didn't find that remotely entertaining, and lost all interest in the author."
2,Topic misrepresented by the title!,"Seveal months ago I embarked upon an intellectual and spiritual journey after reading ""The Da Vinci Code"". The topic of the sacred feminine and the true identity and message of Jesus was always nagging away in the inner recesses of my mind and soul. I made an effort to find several books that might tend to enlighten me more and this work by author Pagels wound up in my library.Unfortunately this work seems to be somewhat obfuscatory and misleading. Yes , the author describes the discovery of the Nag Hamadi documents , and gives an adequate background of the history of Gnosticism , but I was not looking for a book review of the Gnostic Gospels , but for the original works translated. Pagels admits to having an ""orthodox Christian"" background , and tends to minimise the importance of the historic find.Overall the book is valuable , but needed to include some rather lengthy translated excerpts from the original works to be taken more seriously."
4,gnostic gospels,I found this book very educational and well written and layed out. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn more about the gnostic gospels in and easy to follow form.
1,A stunning lack of logic & basic reasoning skills,"The ""success"" of this book is a bit of mystery to me. Perhaps the effusive ""give me what I want to hear"" motivation is alive and kicking in the psyches of the establishment.There is not one jot or tittle of real analysis or coherent argument within these pages. Pagel's conjecture and circular argumentation is profoundly tiresome. There is no sound explanation, for example, for the motivation behind the martyrdom of earliest Christians, given the context of her premises.Though initially looking toward Gnosticism with a warm embrace, I threw this book in the trash instead.Rather than learning more about Gnosticism, this book merely boasts self-invented, anti-orthodoxy rhetoric among misrepresented facts. Disappointing!If this is ""scholarship"", then the academic community is in some serious trouble.((...)"
2,A Year in the Life,"The title comes from a discussion of ""grace,"" the blessing of a meal, at the Thanksgiving table of Rue and Henry Shaw. The dinner guests decide that grace is said before a meal because it is ritual, ""somehting that is repeated in particular ways at particular times.""Rue appreciates ritual and order in her ever-changing, disorderly world as headmaster of a private day school. But the year profiled in this book provides her with little order. Rue moves from death to staff changes to disruptive children to personal and professional dilema.Each chapter of the profile is told in seasoned detail (though the constant point of view shifts are distracting and annoying) but they each seem to be their own story. Like a series of short stories, there doesn't seem to be a climax building. By the end of the book, the feeling is simply, ""Rue made it throught the year."""
2,It focuses on shallow people who work at a private school,"I felt that the main characters were not explored deeply enough. I never really felt emotionally connected to them, therefore, feeling emphathy toward them was impossible. The focus was on what was happening to them rather than how they felt about their situations. The best part was the little disasters and problems that the characters experienced, such as a female teacher who becomes obsessed with birdfeeding and beats up a male teacher who dismantles the birdfeeder outside her classroom since the birds are pooping on the camilla bushes which will lead to their death! END"
1,Terrible Planter,This planter is junk! I bought two of these planters to decorate my front porch. Within two months both planters were cracking and peeling paint. Very poor investment.
2,"If you want objective info, skip this book","This book gives official info from Disney. If you want actual objective reviews, tour guides, and tips that the Disney cast won't tell you, look into the Unofficial Guide to WDW. This book might be a nice companion book, but it shouldn't be your first or only Disney guide."
2,Get on with it already,"This is a great series, no doubt, but Harry Turtledove is dragging his feet. I'm tired of the Machiavellian sneaking around, I'm tired of the pointless subplots (please retire Auerbach and Sommers as quickly as possible), and most of all, I'm tired of The Race abusing the Human Race over and over and over. It's about time to return to open warfare. I want to see M1 battle tanks driving all over the face of Home and I want to see F-14 fighter jets swatting the Lizard air force like flies. I want to see a final, large, and epic battle to, at the very least, end the occupation of Earth and possibly begin the occupation of The Empire. Just my thoughts."
1,To state the obvious,"Yet another in the trend of pushing out product in quantity rather than quality. The characters in this book are exactly the same as those in the Civil War series, well actually the same as any Turtledove series. And I do mean the SAME. Same characterizations, same figures of speech, etc. If you need something light to blow through on the beach or when your mind is concentrating on something else, this might do. However, get it from a library."
2,An obvious runup for another set of books in this series.,"This series started strongly seven books ago. What a shame that it has been dragged out to these lengths. This novel promised to be the conclusion of the World War/Colonization story. All we really got was a lot of loose ends that will certainly culminate with another padded series of books. As another reviewer said below, when Turtledove's good - he's very good. It's a shame to see him painfully drawing out what should have been an excellent story just to sell more books."
2,"Many good points, should've been two books, not one","As always with these books Turtledove has a lot of good ideas and concepts, I eagerly awaited this one. I was surprised to find a book with so many loose ends, bits and pieces that it needed to be two books not one. It makes me wonder if Mr. Turtledove wanted to end the series (I've heard that this is to be the last)in a hurry but had two books worth of material to get rid of."
2,THIS NOVEL HAS NO ENDING- FINALE??,"This novel had no ending. None of the loose ends were tied up. I find this type of writing to be extremely deceptive. The book was billed as the finale of the series- however, it does not even try to conclude any of the plot threads. At the end, the aliens are still here, there has been no final confrontation between them and the U.S.A., etc"
4,The Notroious Landlady,"This DVD opens in England with the possible death of the landlady's husband; all of the neighborhood folks think the American beauty ""done it"", but what they don't know is far more interesting, especially since there is no corpse.The new American in town wants to rent a flat, that's all he wants, until he sees the landlady, then things get hot (scorching heat), he nearly burns the house down.With his position at the embassy at stake, the Yankee plays detective for Scotland Yard in order to help solve the mystery of the missing husband.Too bad his landlady is such a sexy knockout!Between Jack Lemon and Kim Novack trying to keep their hands off each other, and Fred Astaire suddenly trying to weasel in, I never stopped laughing.I won't give away the ending, but keep your eyes peeled for Estelle Winwood's wheelchair."
1,wooden and woeful,"I am a great admirer of Jack Lemmon in films like The Apartment and Missing. Kim Novak has done good work in Vertigo, for instance. But this film is truly awful. The script (even though the usually worthwhile Blake Edwards is given a credit in the screenwriting) is bereft of wit or sparkle, the ""situation"" around which the story is built is simply uninteresting and no amount of creeping up on it can make it more interesting. The directorial touch is leaden and that, perhaps more than anything, is the reason why I just could not watch it to the end. I was dozing off and my partner was already asleep by the time I reached for the remote control. Rarely have I been unable to watch a film to its conclusion. Save your money."
3,interesting but not his best !,"I have been a fan of Jorge Drexler for awhile , ( thank's to a Los angeles DJ ! )and since then had bough a lot of his music.....I must say that I'm not to impressed with his latest cd. I always loved the symplicity of his music , just a guitar and few other instruments, mostly acoustic , very jazzy , like the great cd "" Vaiven "" or "" LLueve "" ,I always compared his work to some early Michael Franks work . But not on this latest one , definetly over produced , and poorly aranged , with a difinit pop direction . Don't get me wrong his voice his fabulous , and his song writing is the finest.....but just spoiled here with too much electronic arrangement !sorry Jorge !"
5,awesome,this is the best cd i ever bought of folk music i say if you like the andy griffith show you must have it
3,Pants okay but way to tight in areas,The pants are well made and warm to wear. Around the waist and ankles its nice and loose but around the hip and crotch area very tight. The pockets are right in the middle of my hips and because of tightness will be hard to use. Except for in that area they are comfortable to wear but unfortunately will not be ordering this sweatpant again cause of size issues. I did order a large and anything bigger and I would be swimming in them but they are just a bit to tight. Will stick with purchasing sweat pants at local stores from now on to assure comfort. Shipping from this company was fast and had no issues with them.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought one of these spading forks at Sears several years ago, and it hadn't had much use until lately when I decided to double dig a small planting bed. After digging about 6 square feet, the fiberglass got a split in it about three inches long. I heard it crack when it happened, and after that, it seemed to want to ""bend"" a little every time I raised up some dirt, couldn't get any leverage with it. I'm sure if I had kept working with it, it would have broken in half at the cracked place or maybe the fork would have broken off like others have said. I took it back to Sears, and they gave me a new one, no questions asked. I just now started working on the dirt again, and after working an area only about a foot wide, the shaft cracked again (this fork is only one day old!), so I will return the brand new one once again. I suppose they will give me another one exactly like it, not sure if I have any other choices, but I certainly would not ever purchase one like this again."
4,"One Classic, one not","It is obvious both recordings here are taken from video sources. The Yolanda audio is pretty good and carries the long lead in to the dream sequence in the movie. The Fleet's In quality is spotty but has more songs to it. It is always entertaining to hear Betty Hutton deliver a song. Overall it is a good bargain for the price and having the Yolanda score is worth the price alone. If you haven't seen the film it is now available on DVD, see it. It is a unique film for its time."
3,Beware! This is only some songs!,"I thought I was buying the actual movies! The other reviews talk about the movies. This is just an audio CD with selected songs! They are low fidelity, sounds like recorded off the film."
3,NOISE,"Not a terrible CD, but just not good enough for the Slayer name. The songs are just too noisy and unlistenable. They have no flavor like the songs off Reign, Hell, South etc. Araya's voice is an annoying monotone that sounds like that dead comedian with the beret (Sam Kinnison) ...there's no feel to it anymore. The drumming is excellent, the bass is inaudible (as usual). The guitar production is crisp but it's like they're in a hurry or something. It's not fast with a feel like Angel of Death, it's just fast and noisy. It's not brutal---my vacuum cleaner sounds more brutal---it's just clangy annoying noise. Sorry. Better luck next time."
1,What is this?,"Excuse me, metal? This is more like the same songs being played over and over again. Iced Earth is metal, and they had melody. This is the same detuned farts over again. I've heard that these guys are badasses. That may be true, but even badasses had at least a ballad. Is this one of those horrid new metal bands? I sure hope they have other albums that are a lot better. And shame on them for relasing something called God Hates Us All on Sep. 11. I'm not that easily offended, but that's just wrong!"
2,Poisoned by Rap,"Slayer (whose ""Raining Blood"" was deservedly chosen as the counterculturecide to rid South Park of its hippie infestation) here swallows a big dose of the Purple Kool-Aid of Rap. The lyrics (to the extent they are intelligible) utterly lack the wit that occasionally makes rap tolerable. If you like the old Slayer, look for something Scandinavian instead."
3,"North of Hell, A New Topic for Slayer?","Well my friends, I think the master Tom Araya himself said it best in 1991: ""With Seasons in the Abyss, I think we've come as far as we can with this music. Our fans should expand their horizons with other types of music.""Apparently he doesn't remember saying this because Slayer has since put out stuff that is really the same as what they did on everything in the 80s, minus the power of twenty something kids, and minus drummer Dave Lombardo.This album has the initial Slayer power, but I don't recommend buying it. Most importantly, if your a Slayer fan from the day as I am, you have all the respect in the world for this band. But, as time goes by, one needs to expand, to grow. There is no growth with this band. Just speed metal. As surprising as it may sound, I think it gets boring."
1,wal mart music,hurry to wal mart before the sale ends on this cd. dont take that seriously for a good cd get green day this cd and wal mart arent good.
1,What the hell is this ...?,"I find it quite hilarious how people call this great music.It's just TERRIBLE music.I've seen dogcrap with more musical talent than these bunch of idiots.What talent do these guys have?The answer would be NO talent whatsoever.If you have an IQ of at least 55,you will be smart and avoid this garbage that has unfortunately been put out."
4,Best Slayer album of the 90's,(...) the best riffs and drumming since Reign in Blood..Tom's scream can get annoying at times but overall the album is very heavy and evil sounding..
3,slayer has always had a good sound ...but,"listen folks i have always enjoyed the sound of slayer . they have a good strong hard sound but. i do not agree with the album label .god hates us all .. don,t think so"
5,Classic Thrash From a Big 4 Band,"If you like thrash metal, you like this album. Buy it now, if you don't know anything about this album I would assume you don't know anything about metal. It's a classic and definitely one of the best things Slayer put out, which is saying something since Slayer put out a lot of good music.Every single song is amazing, but I have to say New Faith is my favorite. It includes other great songs such as Bloodline and Exile."
4,You either get it or you don't.,"This is everything you could want if you are looking for honest, non pretentious, uncompromising music/lyrics. This is the way people talk in the real world when venting frustrations. What Slayer fan could possibly object to the 'F word'? Disciple, 7 faces, payback, warzone and my favorite Exile are highlights. If you want a band to sound the same as they did 20 years ago you don't understand great musicians. New things are ""invented"" in music that appeal to older musicians and they should have the option of showing some of that influence in their new stuff....or should we straight-jacket them? Nu metal? No,it can't be it's Slayer!The lyrics are more frightening then ever because they are about real life, right now! It's disturbing. Alot scarier than a cartoon satan and some imaginary hell."
5,The Slayer CD to buy. Period.,"As a long time metal fan I am sad to say I had lost interest. Everything either sounded watered down and totally dull, or too desperately hard without any real feel behind the music. When I first heard God hates us all I was back. It was so refreshing that it made me feel the way I did the first time I heard ""hit the lights"" way back when. Everything about this CD is what there is to love about metal.. no BS, lyrics that make you want to scream along with them (New Faith), solid guitar lines that are not contrived and fast just for the sake of fast, they have a real feel (Disciple), and the guaranteed goosebumps from the percussion (especially in new faith and cast down). If you are a Slayer fan then you probably already have this CD, if not, get it now. If you want to get a taste of Slayer, this CD is a great beginning.."
3,The roles have been reversed.,Remember when you could call a ton of bands Slayer rip-offs. It was fun wasn't it. I was dissapointed because this cd sounds too nu metally. It's like slayer went from leading the pack to being a follower. Good cd but not too good for Slayer.
2,Another dud,"Not since Seasons has Slayer put out a good album. This album sounds like a continuation of Diabolus. Lyrically, it is great. Musically, it is a bore. No imagination with melody. So easy, a kid could play the rhythms. This is definitely not classic Slayer."
2,2 Stars For Track 3...,"Rest of these songs SUCK. What are Slayer doing? Now that thier millionaires, they don't care if they make a bad album? Every album since Seasons...with an exception for Diabolus... SUCKED TOO. 'Bloodline' made it to MTV for Christ's sake. Slayer are getting worse and worse."
3,Dont be fooled,"All the people saying this is old school Slayer style must not be old school fans, because what we have here is a collection of rehashed guitar riffs, maybe tuned down a couple steps, combined with some very uninteresting lyrics and vocals. The playing is still outstanding, but doesn't really hold water to releases such as Reign in Blood or Seasons in the Abyss.Go out and buy it, because given the above, its still about 50 times better than 99% of heavy metal out there. But, if you want to really be impressed, go out and get yourself the 1998 release by Napalm Death, ""Words From the Exit Wound"". Or go out and get Fantomas, ""The Directors Cut"". Now thats innovation.Hope this helps"
3,I want to love it...,"But alas, I only like it.Firstly, let me say that this film is absolutely gorgeous- quite honestly frame for frame one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Visually stunning, I felt like pausing and just staring at the palette of colors, the scenery, and the beautiful people- and that this reaction may be a problem.I can't help feeling that the story, a simple revenge fable, should have been stronger, or the scenes stronger. Alas, in the end, it was prettier than it was deep. It's meant to be like a short poem, able to give a handful of emotions. Instead it plays about like a small story in really neat handwriting, on very fine perfumed paper.As a dvd, well, its typical for Miramax. The film is there, nothing else."
4,In the best tradition of Brazilian regionalist storytelling,"This was a captivating movie, with beautiful filming that captures the awesome, rugged beauty of the Brazilian sertao. And the story was as captivating and satisfying as it was conventional. What is remarkable about this film, beyond the beauty of the imagery, is the bittersweet ending, that leaves you both relieved that the outcome was not what was expected, but that also was as sad and tragic as a story could be.Although this movie was based on a novel by an Albanian writer, it fits well in an established genre of Brazilian story-telling, the stories of the sertao.The only thing that seemed a bit unnecessary to my imagination was the indication at the beginning that the movie occurred in 1910. Given the transcendence of the story, this was not necessary. This movie could have been set in 1879, 1910, or 1928. It doesn't really matter - it is a mythical, fabulous pre-modern sertao that is the setting, not any particular time and place."
4,Hornblower,This is a collection of connected short stories. All interesting and well written as they would be from Forester. He is always a pleasure to read.
5,Spiral Book,I bought this for my niece after her sister got one as a birthday gift. I bought it for Christmas and she loves it.
1,worthless junk,I bought this for my children hoping to share with them the magic I had with my spirograph as a child. I am very sad that it turned out to be a huge waste of time and money. It is so poorly designed that my children (ages 6 and 7) just can't use it. I was sure they just needed to get the hang of it so I spent about an hour one night doing it by myself and I got about 5 designs out of it before I gave up. To make it work you have to put a lot of pressure on the entire frame to keep it from moving and even then the disk kept slipping out from under it and messing up the design. Not to mention the fact that the constant pressure was hard for me to keep up so I don't know how a child is supposed to do it. I guess I will just have to find a real spirograph set from the 70's.
3,dull fanatasism,"Many interesting quotes and figures, many with references. But I find the endless spew of facts makes the read a bit dull. I was hoping more for an analysis of the problem with a digestable solution, but so far (I am half way through) it has been a flat description of the problem, with little to make me even care about the it, which is remarkable as I am already enraged about how capitalism has gone awry."
3,Great product but FEW pieces,"One of the best aspects of this toy is that you get to change the parts on Mr Potato Head. Unfortunately this toy has very few pieces so make sure that you buy some extras if you do buy this. Having said that, my son has loved playing with this all the same but we will be making another spud related purchase soon."
4,"Very elegant piece of pan, but wear out kinda quick","Used it for about 1 year and the non-stick layer seems to ""peel"" off and the non-stick properties gradually decrease. I realize this happens to any pans, but I was hoping that big brand like T-Fal with above average price should make their pans more durable. My 2 cents."
1,Not the essence of Lovecraft at all...,"This movie is useful more as a means of measuring how much (unfortunately) ""hack"" horror films have been influenced by HPL than as a tribute to the genius of Lovecraft and his horror stories.Obviously the plots are Lovecraftian as they were plundered from good tales (to which they do no justice) and they give one the sensation of reading new Cthulhu mythos stories, but they miss the point entirely.Lovecraft exploits mankind's innermost fears and his great vulnerability to that which comes from the unknown, as well as the consequences of exploring beyond our reaches. The movie posseses none of that spirit, only vaguely alluding to the batrachian monstrosities that populate HPLs world. If you are a fan, you may have fun with what they have done to Lovecraft's stories, or you may hate it for the same reason. If not, it's strictly a B ""horror"" movie."
4,A Sad Life,"Kaiulani really expresses her feelings in this book. I feel sad for her that she has to take boarding school in England. You can feel her emotions as she waits for the message for her to come back home to Hawaii. All she can do is stay in England while her uncle dies back at home. I feel sorry that she can't just go back to her family.Instead of 1 year, she has to stay in England for 8 years. I think that ages 8-11 will enjoy this book and have the feeling of being far from home."
3,Rather boring...,"I was disappointed. The whole book was very british royal-like. Kaiulani was made out to be a sickly, clothes loving, bored, dependent, little girl. She showed no backbone, no independence, no vision, and her relationships were shallow. It is hard enough to get any Hawaiian lit for kids, this kind of book doesn't help. The writing mechanics were fine. Some girls (8-12) might enjoy it as a quick read, but will be disappointed in the character-she doesn't get to be queen and then dies young. Yuck."
3,An OK book. Not as good as Anastasia.,"Kaiulani, the last Hawaiian princess, tells about her life in ""paradise"". I personally thought that the book was mediocre. There was nothing completely remarkable about this book. I felt it did not have the ""it"" that all the other books have."
2,Extremely Dissapointing,"The review title pretty much says it all. You don't expect epic albums from a band like this, but this album is really not great by any standards. You don't expect a band not to change either, but I don't agree that this album is more 'mature' musically. To be honest the album sounds like a collection of Demos to me, ""Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss"" being the only one that should have been a keeper. The 2 things that band always had going for them was witty lyrics and catchy music. This album has neither. I am a big Bloodhound Gang fan but I honestly can't even recommend this to die hard fans."
3,A good CD...but still disappointing,"Well, first of all the good news... There are a number of great tunes on this CD. My favorites are No Hard Feelings, Uhn Tiss, Foxtrox, and Something Diabolical. In fact, No Hard Feelings may be my favorite BHG song of all time...it's brilliant. The other tracks(not including the skits)are pretty good too - no skippers in the bunch for me. What's so disappointing for me though, and why I give this album 3 stars instead of 4 relates to what many other reviewers have already written here. While good, this CD isn't nearly as clever or witty as Hooray. The other annoying thing is that the CD is very short. It's hard to believe that it took them over 5 years to release this CD. I really expected more from the Gang. While this is still a better CD than most stuff out there right now and I do like the more ""synthesized"" sound I have to lower my rating because of their apparent lack of effort."
1,How could...,"...misogyny, scat, and Ralph Wiggums not be any fun? The latest toilet offering from these mental retardates. My grade: D-"
4,"If you've only listened to Hooray For Boobies, this isn't the album for you.","It's Bloodhound Gang, either you get it or you don't. Most like their other songs form other albums, there's clever word play & what would appear as a random mish mosh of semi-talented musicians throwing an album together is actually intelligent comical jabs at anything they can poke fun at. I find that this album, they may have tried to 'mature', it's typical Bloodhound Gang no matter how you look at it."
1,Very Bad Album... Bad as in Bad not Bas as in Good,"This album is lifeless. It's funny though, you have some fans defending the BHG by giving the album a good 4 or 5 star review. But then read their review and they are still critical of it. Like that Robert Raper guy, he gives it a 5 out of 5. But tally up the scores he gives to each individual track and you DO NOT get a 5 star album.Or the guy saying ""if you're a REAL Bloodhound Gang fan you'll like it"".... whatever. The old ""No True Scotsman Fallacy"".This is not a good album.The single was 3 out of 5....This album is not worth the purchase."
2,"No more, please...","The Bloodhound Gang have always been a band with a special place in my heart. Their silly three chord songs seized me by the ear ever since I first heard ""Fire Water Burn"" and have kept doing so, until...this. Mr. Pop's jokes lost their spunky side, the formerly rocking tunes a la Ramones just stopped entertaining. Just like Blink 182, there's a time of coming and going. The time to go has come. Either that or bring something mindblasting, something that involves so much testicle it makes me gag. This album is average at best."
3,Very Cute but...,"This item is very cute but the quality is not there. My daughter is hard on everything but these did not hold up for a few minutes with her. The stitching started coming undone around both center pieces, ie, the dragonfly...so then the stuffing started coming out and we had to stop using them. Sorry, I would not buy them again."
3,Overpriced.,"Wall of Fame overcharged for a run-of-the-mill, not out of circulation, Mrs. Potato Head. They charged $21.99 when it retails for no more than $8.00. I was expecting both Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head and only recived Mrs. Potato Head which is greatly overpriced. Product is not the problem, overpricing is.I am seeking a refund. Marie Teehan, Del Mar, CA"
1,Worst hypnosis tape ever,"First of all, he's the laziest hypnotist ever. Instead of walking you through the process, he barely tells you what it is and it's up to you to follow along. For example, instead of progressively relaxing you, he just tells you to relax. Well, if I could relax, I wouldn't need a hypnosis tape!Secondly, the music is awful, more what I'd expect to hear on my way to hell, instead of meeting the angels to get healed!It was so bad, I couldn't even listen to the whole CD. It's a pity because I have a health problem and was hoping to get some angelic healing. In my opinion, if someone in the hospital had a spontaneous healing after listening to this once, it was because they didn't ever want to have to listen to it again!I threw the CD in the garbage.The seller was great however, fastest delivery I ever got on anything I ever ordered from Amazon."
2,Everyday Life Anthroposophy,"Well, when talking about Anthroposophy one must be prepared to read and read pages and pages of philosophy before we can get to some useful practices! And to be honest the practices are very simplistic. Probably, nothing that you haven't heard of before.This book has too much on Rudolf Steiner himself and further suggests that if you really want to know or understand more, then, you would have to read other books (listed at the end of every chapter). Well, to summarize, this book wasn't what I expected as I read many books before with same convoluted concepts attempting to explain the meaning of life, the human soul and karma. Unfortunately, none of these books have satisfied my hunger for knowledge as they leave you with more questions and no answers."
2,"Second rate city, third rate writer","Mr. Lindberg clearly was absent the day that they taught research development and writing classes. His latest book, not unlike all of the previous selections, is sloppy, inaccurate and poorly written. Don't waste your time with this book. It is tedious and disappointing reading."
3,Well intended guide to Chicago crime scenes.,"Richard Lindberg knows his way around Chicago, having become something of an expert in its lore, particularly in the areas of sports and crime scenes. Return to the Scene of the Crime is supposedly a factual account of some of Chicago's most notorious crimes and it is an interesting journey around town. But I question how many of the ""facts"" are truly factual? As biographer of William Heirens, to whom Lindberg devotes two chapters, I found damaging statements which were blatantly untrue. I am not an expert in the other numerous crimes with which he deals, but based on his treatment of Heirens, he is suspect."
1,Skip it -----,"I am a fan of Suzanne Brockman; however, I must disagree with most of the other reviewers. This book was VERY lacking in the 'punch' and 'power' of Ms. Brockman's other books (SEALS). The constant humiliation of the primary character was over done. I skipped to the end of the book just to end the pain. I advise readers to PLEASE not judge Ms. Brockman's work on this novel only. She is an excellent storyteller --- unfortunately, her talents aren't exhibited in this book."
1,What a waste...,"The Led Zeppelin Complete book comes in many versions, this one is for guitar, printed in 1990 and contains both notation and tab for the first 5 LZ albums.The problem is it's only partial notation.For most songs it's just the main riff which any intermediate player can figure out on their own and beginners can look up any of the free tabs that are all over the net.The real screamer here is that even though only parts of the music are printed, much of it is just plain wrong. I'm not talking small mistakes here either but serious 'are you kidding me' moments.I bought this book for the solo's and for the harder passages but to my surprise these were left out save one or two.So what use is this book? Well it has none, it's going back for a refund.If anyone can show me a truly good notation book on this awesome band, please feel free to drop me an email. I'd appreciate it."
4,"Simple, easy, efficient.",Worked just fine. Simply put into the slot and there ! Computer is much faster now. Product was put in my mail box since it was so small. I was happy to see that it was properly delivered. Worth the twenty five dollars.
5,"Love, laughter, and lots of fun!","I couldn't put it down. Tess Mallory does it again. A great adventure romance. I really felt transported along with Jix. The characters were lively and fresh, and began to feel like friends by the end. I hope there's a sequel in the works!"
5,Hermetic Science Revealed by a True Adept,This book is a gem. Franz Bardon was really one of the greats when it comes to spiritual practice and discipline. Buy the book and get his other books. You will not regret it.
4,One of the Best,"Whenever someone asks me what book(s) they should read to get started in magick I reccomend this one. No glut of rituals, no overabundance of theory, and alot of practical work.A step by step trainning program for actually aquireing the basic skills of a mage. How to control your own mind, how to revamp your emotions, and how to work with energy. Every step is necessary, and helps you develop the practical skill and knowlage to handle the next portion.My only problem is that the book is translated in such a way that it is hard to tell what Bardon means sometimes. There are also some random mundane errors here and there, but nothing huge and glareing. Initiation Into Hermetics is best read with Rawn Clark's ""A Bardon Companion"" for clarification."
2,Disappointed-Me too,"I purchased this book several years ago and will not totallydiscredit Bardon's work, but after 40 or so pages I was lost.To me, many of these gurus really don't want to make theirknowledge easily attainable or accessable. So they setup roadblocksof their own. In addition, there are several websites many readersgo on to get help with his books. This book isn't worth the money.Those of you who got this or are getting it i'm not mad at ya."
5,wish it was the first,"this has to be the greatest book ever written on magik.franz goes into great detail about using the the different techniques to utilize your mind but doesnt force upon his methods, and leaves enough room for experimentation. i wish i had started reading it sooner as i would be much further along in my own practices"
5,The greatest soul brother,"Hutch is the man, his music is timeless. ""Homeboy"" Hutch should be thought of in the same breath as Marvin , Stevie, Smokey, in the ranks of the greatest of the Motown/Tamila era."
5,A serious but accessible look at Jazz fundamentals,"I am not qualified to write a long and significant review, but that is my point. I am a beginner, and was looking for a book to start me out right, address the fundamental questions and get me started on the basics.By the way, by beginner I mean that, while I have played chords and such since junior high school, I just recently started reading music, studying the basics of music theory, and going back to basics generally to learn good habits and techniques and start developing a working knowledge of jazz.Marvelous book, tells me in plain English what I need to learn and what to practice and why. Relates the work to what the professional do."
2,Where's the Jazz?,"I didn't find this book helpful at all. None of the example in the book sound even remotely like jazz. All this book has you do is play a bunch of boring chord tones and scales. Since so much of it is based on major chords, there is no bluesy sound to the examples. Souless and rote. Just the opposite of jazz."
5,Good phone holder,"Very nice. Comes with a long strap and a short strap that snaps on. The only thing is phone can easily slide in and out, and I put a palm treo in mine and it fits perfect. I think I will also put a little piece of velcro on my phone and case to keep it from falling out."
3,Ok for a Movie shot in during that time..,This is one of them late night movies you watch when coming in from a late night out on the weekend. You cant ask for much for a movie shot in the late 90's. This fits that era. Of course it would not be relevant now. But they did a good job.
5,inspirational,This entire cd is inspiring. Voices of Light has truely been bless with a talent of beautiful voices and able to deliver the message of the lord through music. I am a witness to say that in a time of trials and tribulations listening to God's message through music comfort me and uplift my spirits to keep pressing on.
4,Works for me!,"I like these rollers because they have little teeth on them that holds the hair so that they won't slip out. It does take them a while to heat-up, but I usually plug them in ahead of time, so it doesn't really matter to me. The clips are easy to use and keep the rollers in place. I've tried the rollers covered in that velvet material, but they just didn't hold the hair in place. These have been my favorite so far. My only complaint is that I wish extra rollers and clips were sold in the stores, but you can order them directly from Conair."
3,These are cute!,My son wanted pencil toppers and i ordered these. They are cute and larger than i thought they would be.
4,EVERYBODY CAN LEARN ABOUT JAPANESE STEEL WITH THIS BOOK,IF YOU COLLECT JAPANESE SWORDS YOU MUST HAVE THIS EXCELLEBT BOOK
3,Japanese edge weapons.,"Although the title is a bit misleading, as the book also includes other edge weapons besides swords as well as their fittings, it was informative for a novice collector. The color photographs are outstanding."
3,Surprise! Surprise!,"This is not the same 'Jericho' 5 man hard rock/progressive band from the late 60's early 70s. Similar bands to this band would not be Sir Lord Baltimore, Andromeda et. al. This band is a 90's band that has an alternative edge to their sound. I found their music to be innovative and kinda good. Their singer at times sounds like Jim Morrison, but don't be fooled into thinking that this is the brilliant 'Jericho' from the 1970s. Because they ain't them! If you like Collective soul, or the Dave Matthews band with a lyrical death twist then this band is for you! Why these bands name themselves after one another is beyond me and can be confusing. I'm sorry I got confused on this one!"
3,High Maintenance Toy,"Such a disappointing toy. The shooting disk often get stuck in launching feature and requires a lot parental assistance to fix. Also, the pieces do not stay assembled very well. When there isn't a lot of Batmobile choices, it's disappointing when the coolest looking one to your child doesn't operate properly."
2,Pretentious & Boring...,"I love mysteries.... good ones, that is. I found this book begging for attention from a character that acts wrongly superior to any other characters by her side. I felt her looking down her nose at others and insulting the small-town life that is clearly a part of the authors life. In additon, I found the conversations and descriptions of the days happenings to be over-detailed and more than a little annoying. I mean, really --- is it necessary to describe just how much make-up was applied; listen to Skye debate over what to prepare for Thanksgiving dinner; how the whole dinner played out with men in one room and women in the other --- when she's supposed to be solving a murder?! The polt has a ton of potential and could be a good read if there were a stronger, less superficial main character (and author). This is the first 'Scumble River Mystery' I've read. Maybe the others are better.... but I'll never know."
1,Boring....,Wow this book is bad. I made it 2/3rds through and gave up. Its one of the very few times I couldnt finish a book because it was so bad. Basically its Han Solo from star wars and a mysterious cargo. It was so slow and uninteresting and cliche to me. Steer clear.
5,Kept Me Up Till Two in the Morning,"As a fan of mysteries, science fiction, and Timothy Zahn, I was delighted to find this book. Sure, it was not a deep, thoughtful work, and the ending seemed a bit deja vu, but this book was entertainment at its best. The twists and turns kept me flipping pages all the way through the night. After the slightly cliche, but nevertheless suprising ending, I went and reread the book. It's amazing how Zahn had subtly worked all the clues to the killer's identity and Jordan's job description throughout the entire novel. Definitely worth the time!"
1,Propaganda,"Take a minute to browse the sample pages available on this Encyclopedia. It's not your typical set of encyclopedia topics.Abolition MovementAboriginesJane Addams (Progressive)AfricaNotice a pattern? No John Adams or Samuel Adams for example. No, those founding fathers can't be too important. What's important is that our children learn as much about non-Western cultures and problems with Western culture as possible.Clearly this encyclopedia was created with an agenda. ""Scholastic"" apparently means something else these days."
4,Great Storage,"This box can hold only two G.I. Joes and all their equiptment. My friend has this set, and it keeps all his G.I. Joes and things inside it. I wouldn't say this is fun, because how could a box be fun? It really helps because their are many small things like gernades, magazines, and pistols that can be lost. This toy is not to educational, but the G.I. Joes can be. This toy is very durable. After at least a year my friend's box is in pretty good shape. And it dosent seem to have fadded at all. This is a great thing to hold your G.I. Joes and exceseries."
1,ok but down in the dust,"well my aunt once brought me this toy I ran up and grabbed the toy I opened the toy fast as I could. it was hours of fun a few days later I started losing all the gear. but I remember all the pieces 4 stinkbombs 4 powerbars giant gun 2 pack figures cannot hold the giant gun. there is a removeable tray 2 guys one two pack of figures fits the whole footlocker you can write your name,rank and serial number this toy is not fun beacause it just opens and closes opens and closes figures in and out in and out.gear being lost. i wish she never brought it home for me on my baby brothers birthday so I could be as happy as him. humph"
4,Oh dear!,"Its a shame that people cannot accept it for what it is, A MOVIE ! Its in the same style as Tom & Jerry. Though i suppose you'd complain that was discusting also, The animators done a great job on the mouse and other effects, the Roach was animated too, and i was really impressed with that ( i guess maybe being an animator myself, i care more about those sort of things :). Some people also were slating the film simply because the two brothers were nasty pieces of work, well, thats the characters, if they weren't trying to kill the mouse it wouldn't be much of a mouse hunt would it, Jesus ! Those people who are complainging about those sort of things are the people acting immature."
3,Mouse in the House,"Sweet natured and irresistibly cute, MouseHunt pairs two brothers against the likes of a small mouse that has taken up its abode in a musty, damp old house the two brothers have just inherited from their father. What seems, ever so like a simple plan of releasing the house from one small mouse, escalates into a full scale war where the deductions of logical thinking are completley tossed to the wind. Fun for a while, the film soon sinks into one labouriously hatched plan to the next, plans that never seem to get rid of the mouse. Echoing films of the late Laurel and Hardy, the slapstick comedy somehow all seems to have been done before in other countless films. Lane and Evans however work together wonderfully diverting attention away form the mediocraties that exist. Cute and fun loving, the kids should find it a blast to see a mouse outwitt two grownup men."
2,Hard price to pay for good music.,"To tell the truth, I bought this DVD because I liked the music and couldn't find a decently priced CD of the soundtrack. The movie has a few good moments, but it's hard to decide whether to root for Nathan Lane and Lee Evans, or for the mouse. A few good comedic ideas that just aren't developed very well. Worth it ONLY if you're a hardcore fan of Nathan Lane (or Christopher Walken)."
4,Fantastic Flick,This movie is absolutely hilarious. The mouse out smarting the two brothers was very well done. The movie was clearly influenced by the Home Alone movie and had various Laurel & Hardy type antics in it. Christopher Walken as the Pest control man was very fitting. Basically if you like slap stick comedy and silly skits this is a movie to check out. An enjoyable piece for the whole family. I highly recommend it for all age groups.
5,Good movie,I am a grown woman and I still love this movie. I will be showing this movie to my children someday. Good buy for a good price.
4,A Good One,"A silly, fun movie for everyone . Very enjoyable. Love the leads! Definitely worth the watch - fun for any age."
3,Hilarious,this movie brought many people to tears as the comedy proved to make my family laugh at mice yet not wanting to eat cheese
1,region error!,Won't play keep getting region error message ! I can switch one of my players over but what a pain!
4,Classic sitcom,"I just happened to catch the first episode when it aired back in 1994. The scene in which Ellen is taking her driver's license photo, and her rambling on several times in the episode had me cracking up. I then followed the series through its 5 seasons, and although it really became three different series through time (most of season 1's characters are replaced after a few episodes and the series has a different point of view after the famous ""coming out"" episode of season 4), this became one of my favorite series of the 90s and this DVD set is a great way to relive some of Ellen's comedic talent.While the series had its ups and downs, there are several incredibly funny scenes and episodes worth watching from time to time, making this DVD set worth getting for those who love sitcoms."
1,Not Very Good,"Male end leaked, female end blew off in the middle of the night. Water everywhere, manager was very unhappy. Also puts a bad taste to the water."
2,I avoid these,"I travel for a living and have been in my 5th wheel for 7 years. I avoid these hoses because they do not hold up. The ends develop leaks very quickly. The hose itself is not bad quality, it is the fittings that are cheap and undependable. If you have to buy this hose, as I have in the past, be sure and swing by lawn and garden and pick up a repair kit so you can replace the fittings when they start leaking."
5,Hollywood At it's Best,"For all those people who say all movies are junk, try this one it's not. Yes it's not totally acurate, but then who cares with Gregory Peck and Susan Hayworth.If you are to young to know who they are, give them a chance. They were only the top in Hollywood for over 30 years."
5,David and Bathsheba,"David and BathshebaThis movie was all that I expected. It is shown as it is written in the Bible. It is really good, and I enjoyed it very much."
2,David and Bathsheba,As we know this is famous Bible move. I had seen this very long times ago when I was young. I wanted to see this again. I hope to say just this old move.
2,Very cute but not durable,"I have a few of these Crocodile Creek placemats. They are by far the most attractive placemats I have found. BUT, they are the LEAST durable. The pictures scrape off easily and I have only used a sponge on them. They still keep my table clean like they're supposed too, but they are not cute any more. They would be better play mats but not good for eating and wiping clean. Not a great purchase."
4,Nice product,Like the dried fruit in it but find the grain rather fine. Prefer it a bit more coarse in texture. My taste...
2,Confusing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I started to play this game thinking it would be so fun.Then I occored a problem when I could only heal rabbits nothing but rabbits!I did everything it said to and waited.After 12 coustermers I still only got rabbits.So frustrating!I tried buying food,toys,and I even bought a bigger cage!Three days later,no cats!I gave up on the game about 2 weeks ago.Im 10 years old and i dont get this game!But other wise the game iws fun but the graphics are dissapouinting.My charector gets stuck about 3 times every 30 min.Also when you start a brand new game she has a shirt too little for her and her hair is all choppy.I have to waste mony on a wardrobe so she can get a decent hair style and docter coat.This game is really diisapointing in some areas but in others its fine i guess.Dont buy it!"
2,The Game Controls,"well when i first got this game, i didn't know what to do. but there is something called the tutorial where it helps you play the game. this really helped me.so when you get to the options menu, click on scenario and click on tutorial.and once you take care of 10 bunnies you go on to cats then you go on to something else.this game is a little confusing but fun."
1,bad game,"This game can get very boring. It's very confusing and hard to control. It is sooooo frustrating!!!!!!!!! The instruction booklet doesn't come in handy either. Like some other people, I only got rabbits too. I bought this game because I wanted to heal cats and horses. But, only rabbits came. Buying this game was a big mistake. It is reallly no fun. Don't waste your money on this game. I gave up about a month ago. I've left it on the shelf and haven't touched it since."
4,"Good, but expected Better","Honestly, I am very zealous for the word of God, and I feel that this translation could have rendered better. I recomend, and if you know spanish, to get the peshitta in spanish, if you are looking for as close as possible to original peshitta manuscripts. This bible is larger than my NASB study bible, and it have no side notes or commentary. Large print,and heavier than ur average bible.I own over 100 translations in 4 languages, so I spend much of my time comparing scripture. There is nothing wrong with the translation, it could be that I expected more, and feel like its been edited to much (outside of George Lamsa's original translation). Ex. ""LORD"" instead of ""Yahweh"" or ""God"" instead of ""Ala'aha"" (Aramaic way of saying God). I Recomend it to put it in your library, but for the closes Aramaic experiance, get a hold of it in Spanish."
3,Translated from what?,"2. Corinthians 14 is definitely *not* translated from any ""ancient Eastern text"", since neither the Syriac nor the Greek mss has ""unknown"" before ""tongue"". Lamsa's ""translation"" of 2. Corinthians 14 looks more like a rip-off from the KJV. Also there is no listing of Mss or any source that Lamsa supposedly used. Bad scholarship with an agenda. Also Lamsa was a Protestant, and so obviously not a member of the Oriental Syriac Church, whose Bible he claims to have translated. Sorry for this negative review."
1,The Original?,When I found out about this book I was very excited and curious. I could almost sense a kind of 'Indiana Jones' character in me. Great thanks to Lamsa's Bible I have now done a tiny bit of research and it has been a very interesting and rewarding adventure indeed. I hope you have time for the same!As for the bible I am still happy with my NRSV. God bless!
1,What a sad joke.,"I stupidly bought this based on Amazon reviews and Peter Sellars fame as a director. I hated it from the start and not so much because of the updating. The leveling between Don Giovanni, who is supposed to be an aristocrat {albeit totally corrupt} and the others in the production totally distorts the story. The story is just squeezed into the director's concept into a totally squalid, depressing, Harlem regardless of the distortions involved. This is the real trash of eurotrash. I did not even notice the singing which did not seem to be outstanding. The sound was quite poor, harsh sounding. which made the voices hard to evaluate, especially the Sopranos. Avoid and buy a traditional version."
5,this is a classic - a collectable,"First class screenplay, performances and film direction. It also follows the historical chronology pretty well. A great way to teach a kid about WW2 - perhaps the last truly moral war America ever fought."
5,excellent in everything,"My husband is a vet, and loves these kinds of movie's, he was very happy with it. And enjoyed it A LOT"
3,"A dated look, but a timeless performance","George Patton was a man of his time -- he never would have made it as far as he did in today's military. WWII provided a unique opening for his difficult and contrary personality, while his unpleasant side could be tolerated (sometimes just barely) by his superiors.The film's atmospherics are dated -- lighting and color are those of the 1960s, props and effects are not nearly so detailed as they would be today. Compare those aspects of ""Patton"" to the same in ""Letters from Iwo Jima"", or even the TV series ""Band of Brothers"". George C. Scott did, however, give us a strong impression of Patton's leadership style and personality. It is the star's performance that makes this film worth owning on DVD."
5,Patton,"""Patton"" was a outstanding movie, which was for a outstanding leader. General Patton was a man who was not afraid to speak his mind. He is a great example of a American."
2,Patton,If you bought this movie to see Patton save your money on the Blue Ray version. It takes 10 minutes before the movie starts. You have to first get through a movie preview and then a talk about the movie by the director. When I buy a movie I want to watch the movie not a bunch of preview garbage. When I finally got to the movie it was great.
5,Great value!,"Patton is a life-changing movie that was a great deal from Amazon, especially on Blu-Ray! I recommend Amazon for any Blu-Rays one might want to purchase."
1,Terrible quality DVD,"Received the DVD after about a week, and the quality of the DVD was absolutely terrible. There was something sticky all over the disk, and the surface area of the DVD itself was all nicked up and smeared with something also."
1,Not a full version of the DVD-Patton,"I purchased the DVD movie, Patton, because it is one of my favorite films. It came as a two-disc set. The first disc was the movie, but not the complete version of the movie. It only showed the first half. The Normandy section and the ending was completely left out, although it did show the credits.The second disc was only the bonus features, which showed a documentary and clips of the movie.I'm am very disappointed in this purchase."
5,This is the Patton to get!,"If you (like me) purchased the first PATTON BD and were disappointed, 20th Century Fox has more than made amends with this new release.The studio fully resorted and rescanned the film and the result is reference quality video and audio. Unlike the first BD release which suffered from over-edge-ehnanced video that made it look hard and harsh, this edition is film-like perfection.The 5.1 DTS Master PCM Audio is peerless. Great surround effects and the iconic Jerry Goldsmith score is stunningly beautiful.If you love the film, donate the first BD (and the DVD if you have it) to your local library and buy this one. It will not disappoint!"
3,Blah.,"I ordered this for my 2 guinea pigs, and it was just what I expected. It's small, so it doesn't hold much hay, and the hay falls out and onto the floor easily. But, it was worth the money since it was pretty cheap and it does help organize their cage a little bit more."
3,Nice but could be better,"The wire portion of the item was OK, but the salt lick that came with it was of extremely low quality. It fell apart on the first day, not good. It crumbles like a dirt clod when you touched it."
3,it's okay.,"I thought that this would be a good thing to have, so that the hay would not be on the ground. But its hard to pull together and hard to fill because the hay kept falling though the wire. Once we did get the hay in it our Guinea Pig would eat and it all fell out. So we use it for other treats like celery and carrots."
3,It's OK...,"I bought this when I first bought my guinea pig. It worked fine until it broke, (not my fault)! What I recommended is the Super Pet Rabbit Rollin' The Hay Holder. It works for other animals, for example a guinea pig too. It is much easier to give hay, it is easier to clean, and my piggy has fun rolling the hay holder with her hind legs. SO CUTE!! :)"
2,A taste of history.,I read this book a long time ago. I have recently become legally blind and bought this book on audio cassette. I loved listening to it even more than reading it myself. The only problem I had was the ending. Does she ever see her love again? Did I miss something or do we just know she lives happily ever after?
2,"Good historical info, but poor in story-line","This book was very informative regarding the Japanese internment. However, the story line was very slow, and un-entertaining. I continued reading the book soley for the historic perspective."
4,"Good, but could have been better.","Having this guide is a lot better than having nothing at all, but still, I suggest you don't buy it if any of the following details annoy you:*** -Low quality black&white screenshots -The guy doesn't tell where most of the items are, he just re-wrote what was on the map that you get with the game, which doesn't tell much -Halfway through the guide, the guy stops giving some interesting information, like Neutral monster type/location.*** Otherwise, this guide is complete and helps a lot to find everything in the game."
2,Mediocre Wine Saver,"This item was an exciting find for me, but clumsy to use on some wine bottles and not made of very good quality materials. The cover doesn't fit that well and cracked in shipping."
3,good but should have been better.,"I love the actor who played Abraham, hes one of my favorites. But there's nudity that's highly disrespectful to the bible. The bible advocates against nudity. second the way it covers the stories they are not very enlightening, the bible discusses the moral reasons for Gods activities in the Bible on the subjects they cover. Don't get me wrong I am religious go to church know that one is to consider GOD above all else.I suggest the animated versions of the bible.They could have changed the nude scenes so the thespians would have been behind bushes and such so that one doesn't see parts like their buts and there by respect the bibles teachings about clothing and dress."
3,BAD PICTURE QUALITY,"I WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS MOVIE, THE QUALITY WAS BAD TOO MAYBE THAT IS BECAUSE IT IS AN OLD MOVIE, IT IS A ONE TIME WATCH."
2,Not what I expected,I was hoping for more soothing songs with the flute with nature background and got neither.
1,"What's all the fuss about this piece of crap ""cult film""?","I realize that a lot of people literally WORSHIP this movie, seeing it again & again & again, ad nauseum. I've TRIED very hard to see what it is about this film that's so incredibly awesome, but I can't find ANYTHING I like about it! The oft-quoted dialogue is inane, the songs are weak, and the characters are a collection of gothic flakes that only other gothic flakes could identify with. I've been in a theater with a large number of Rocky Horror devotees, and it was a weird experience --- this one guy sitting on the floor near me kept saying ""jokes"" throughout the film --- and NOT A SINGLE ONE WAS EVEN THE REMOTEST BIT AMUSING --- not even the other devotees were laughing! But it didn't bother him in the least, as he kept up his almost prepared list of humorless banter. Eventually I walked out in disgust. It's an experience I don't want to re-live."
3,sort of amusing,"I'd heard some of the songs on the radio, and liked one or two, so it was fun to see them in the movie for the first time recently. To those who don't like this movie, and wonder how it became a cult classic: well, the movie was a total flop when first released, but someone at the studio thought it could be saved if pushed as a cult-see-it-again-and-again film. And people bought into that. I never saw it in the theater. Meatloaf fans should be alerted that he is in the movie. It's a stupid movie, but the music is pretty good, and rock musicals almost fail in the music department. And Tim Curry plays camp well, as the vain, cocky star. I'm surprised he didn't become a bigger star. Maybe this movie pigeon-holed him in studio executives eyes, and they didn't know what to do with him. Anyway, ""Flash"", the Flash Gordon film Queen did the soundttrack for is a stupid film, but I liked that , too. (Although that one wasn't weird like this one)."
5,Give Yourself Over to Rocky Horror,"This is an absolutely wonderful DVD! Packed with loads of sinful extras that will chill you, thrill you, and fulfill you! Rocky Horror has never looked or sounded as fabulous as it does on this DVD. Disc one contains two versions of the film (UK and US) with audio commentary by Richard O'Briena and Pat Quinn, an audience participation track, and DVD ROM extras (a video jukebox, games, a Rocky Horror timeline, and screensavers). Disc 2 contains deleted musical scenes (""Superheroes"" & ""Once in a While""), alternate takes, documentaries, sing-alongs, and more. If you're a fan of ROCKY HORROR, this is a DVD you can't be without. Frank's throwing one of his affairs, so why don't you some up to the lab and see what's on the slab?"
5,What A Blast!!!!!!,"I saw this movie for the first time back in the 70's at a theater where everyone dressed up and actually did what you see some of the ""Participating Audience"" does in the movie and let me tell you it was a blast!!!! Kids today forgot how to live and I think they could learn how to have fun by doing ""the time warp."""
5,Beautiful,I love the case with the full color pics and the Bluray has the US and UK versions of the film.
1,"Silly, boring waste of time",This silly attempt at a spoof is a total waste of time. I had a hard time staying awake during it and would rather retake a chemistry final than watch it again. Close your eyes and pick a random movie off the shelf of Blockbuster -- the chances are 99% that it will be better.
1,What a waste of video tape,"I think the summary pretty well sums it up. The only redeeming benefit to watching this at home on the small screen is that I did not have to put up with the stupid antics of the mindless trash that seem to ""live to see"" this waste of time, space and energy at a movie house."
3,xmas present,bought for a friend for christmas. i never cared to see the movie but it made my friend happy. the sender sent it a.s.a.p. which really helped out.
5,Excellent Choice!,"Let me ask this question- do you consider yourself to be normal? Conventional? Conformist? If so, unless you're on drugs, you probably won't like this. But if you aren't any of these things, you'll love this movie! It lets out the wild side of you, lets you open up your mind to a world that you might not have known exists. It's probably especially fun to see live- I still haven't had the chance- but if you're like me and you can't get to it live, the tape works just as well. Watch it to have a fun time, and if you're watching it with friends, you'll have a greater time!"
5,fun party,We got this movie to play on Halloween when some friends came over. It was fun singing along. Everyone had a blast.
4,I remember doing the time warp,"I will start by saying that there is not a person who dislikes musicals more than I. That being said, I am in love with this movie. It came out well before I was born, and is a cult classic. My uncle is the one who got me hooked on this movie, and now I watch it quite a bit. I hope to attend a midnight showing of this movie soon, as they sound like a lot of fun. Even though I hate musicals, I believe that this is one of the greatest movies ever. Such a rollicking good old time, you will be entrenched in this movie and its characters. Once you watch it once, I guarantee that you will want to see it again and again."
4,The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"I rented this video for Halloween. I's still the campy, funny musical adventure I remember. It's an ageless story of good vs bad and unfulfilled desires. Watch it for a laugh."
3,Only if you NEED the screen . . .,"Not quite the worst movie of all time, but that was actually intended . . . The widescreen format is nice, but the ""never before seen footage"" has mostly been in the theaters before, except for the song ""Once In A While"" by Brad, which is mostly flashbacks.""Superheroes"" is nice, but rather than include the ""new"" scenes in the film, they tag them on at the end, which is just aggravating. ""Superheroes"" actually works well, and the cut is annoying. Two trailers are also included."
2,"Great Movie, but my DVD set is missing pieces!","I love this movie, and the DVD is great, but I was greatly disappointed when I opened my DVD package and realized that all the extras that were supposed to come with the set were not there. I only got the DVD's, when it was supposed to also come with a bunch of extra booklets and other small pull-outs. Overall, the movie is great and I highly recommend it, but I was disappointed with the lack of the extras I was supposed to receive."
2,The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"I gave "" The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" a second chance.I still liked it about as much as like writing movie reviews, not at all.I don't know what all the big deal is about this movie, why some people watch it over and over. It is just boring to me.I won't fall for all the hype about it anymore."
3,"DVD = 5 Stars, Bluray = 3","Some things just were not meant to be watched on Blu Ray on a 46"" 1080p LED TV with 120MHz refresh... and this is certainly one of them.I've seen RHPS in theaters (and been the projectionist you all yell at) and on DVD and the Blu Ray was a completely different experience. For some films bright vivid colors and images work wonders, and restorations like from the Criterion Collection never cease to amaze... but some things should be left the way they are. Dirty, stained, dark and all together wonderful... things like Rocky Horror.I'm just glad I kept my DVD copy when the Bluray came."
5,Best Movie Ever Made!,"The people (Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon) The Music (Time Warp) All were wonderful! It was like one big party and I loved it~ Every time you see it, it is like watching it for the first time. I recommend you buy it, because there is no other Movie like it!"
1,Disappointingly Little,"Probably 25 to 30% blank space + filler and another 25% no better than info in help files, it's probably better to redirect your money into one of the many highly regarded books from this very successful author."
4,Onigiri,"Very good product, larger than I expected it to be. Wish it was a little softer but other than that, its cute, useful as a mini pillow when relaxing, and its a freaking onigiri pillow with a face and limbs, awesome."
1,This is pathetic,"This game isn't as good as most of the 1st person shooters on the PS1. For a release on the PS2 this is a pathetic excuse. You'd be better off buying Syphon Filter 1 or 2, or Medal of Honor for the PS1, or waiting for new versions of those games to come out on the PS2."
2,A constant Loop,"I read many reviews for this game, many said it was excellant and you must buy it. But when i eventually did get round to buying it i managed to complete the story mode 3 hours after purchase. The Story Mode consists of about 6 levels which are all exactly the same with the slight exception of the terrain and the enemys.When ever you complete a level you cen either unlock new enemys which doest make a difference because all their abilitys are the same, you can unlock new challenge modes which are extremly similar to the story mode.The game doesnt even have a story unlike some games. Youve just been put in this world to go around killing a bunch of peole for some odd reason. The game is the same from start to finish a complete bore. I would recommend Unreal Tornament for the PC which alot better and more fun."
5,So Sweet!,"I haven't bought this game yet but I have rented it many times. It has unbelievable graphics, and is very fun. The game is very fast so you need to be quick to the trigger in the game which can make the game hard at some points. Some times you can be surrounded by 4-5 enemies and you know you don't stand a chance because the fire so quickly and aim for your head. Other than that I would most certainly say this will be one of the top 5 ps2 games for years to come."
4,Interesting introduction to Ruskin and his work,"This is an ideal introduction to the life and work of John Ruskin. It's clear and readable but has lots of facts. My only criticism is that it doesn't give as much of a psychological insight into Ruskin as I would have liked. I was left wondering what kind of person Ruskin really was. Still, I do recommend it - and it is reasonably priced too."
4,The story behind the automobile industry soap opera.,Hailey brings out the intricacies of the tumultulous behind the scenes wheeling and dealing in this dramatized novelization of the sopa opera that is the auto industry.
2,Collector's Dream,"The GI Joe Harley Davidson cycle is a collector's dream. This is the most authentic WWII cycle I have ever seen. Unfortunately, the price is a bit steep, thereby making it a collectible and NOT a TOY. If you are looking for a dust collecting device that is authentically scaled and pretty cool, then I recommend you collect dust with the GI Joe Harley Cycle and rider."
2,Grab this Joe!,"Listen up boys and girls. Hasbro states that this is the first vehicle they've made for the 12"" G.I. Joe collection in a long time. Coupled with the fact that as baby boomers age this item can only appreciate in value. Yes, it's more likely to become a collectors item than a toy to play with. But even grown men need their toys and hobbies. Final thought: Two words - Harley Davidson"
4,This was a great read!,"This is my first book from author Nina Bangs and I can't wait to read another! It was fun, great dialogue... definitely a treat! This is not a book for someone looking for major depth in a romance.... but it's perfect for someone looking for a quick, enjoyable read."
2,funny but not very interesting,"I was very excited when I bought this book. I mean the cover art and the title made it seem like it would be very hot. Well it wasn't it fizzled. The humor was great. I loved the toy Peter but the main characters of Ian, the Pleasure Master, and Kathy the hairdresser from present day New York, were lacking in substance. I did like the interaction between Neil, the brother and Coco Kathy's lawyer, but that couldn't help this story much. I wish it could have been better."
2,Not worth the time....,"I agree with the last reviewer about the book being a BIG Disappointment. I was expecting a lot more than what this book had to offer. The cell phone and toys were just too weird for my taste and were very unbelievable for me. I love romantic time-travel, but once you have read magical tales of the here and then, it's really hard to beat. I would suggest looking into Lynn Kurland or Karen Marie Moning if you really want to be transported back in time and a tale that will leave you wishing it were you."
2,Poor Quality,Its itchy and Does not keep you very warm falls apart after ten washes. Iwould recomend carharrt L.Johns all the way
5,strong made,Indera extra heavyweight thermal bottoms Strong thick and heavy compare to the cheaper brand i paid $15 it is not cheap but Comparing to $9 thermal pants it is worth it
3,Rothco Thermals,"The product is O.K., but overpriced. I thought the product would be heavier-duty than it is. Walmart sells a similar product (even though it is Walmart) at one-half what this product cost. Had I known the product was of mass appeal quality, I would have simply saved money and purchased it at, God forbid, Walmart."
2,Boring,I am only on chaper 4 and struggling to finish this book. It has given samples of everything and pinpointed nothing. I was expecting ideas for courses of action but I don't see this happening. I doubt if i will finish this book.
4,Book Review,"I admit I did not have high hopes for this book, it being a purchase for college. But, after reading the first few chapters, I found it very interesting, informative, and detailed. I think after reading the entire book, I will be well prepared for teaching in the nursing environment.Good so far..."
3,And no one warned them before they bought the house?,"This is a good example way when you buy a home, check it's history first. Leaky roof, no problem. Bad plumbing, no problem. House haunted by evil spirits out to even the score? Ok, BIG problem. When an american family buys a house in Japan, they learn that it is haunted by no-so-friendly ghosts. It is a sorted, ugly tale filled withsex, betrayal.....well, you get the general idea. At it's close, there is no happy ending and someone loses their head (not to mention a pool of blood where the body falls)."
1,Best Comedy I've Seen in Years,"Imagine having the same name as the Green Acres laywer who only wanted to farm. Throw in a throwback from The Virginian series. Add Susan George to provide some needless nudity and sex. Finally, bring in some ghosts who look like rejects from Mr. Topper, and you got the makings of an MST-3K laughathon. Oh, did I forget a monk left over from Kung Fu?Generic music, generic plot, Oriental ghosts grunting, and weird-looking spider/crab things (any of which could have been made by a group of fifth graders). Absolutely hilarious! The three ghosts from an earlier age possessed and dispossessed at will. And that Academy-Award acting! ""Take me out tonight!"" Who could turn down that question? Who could understand it?Didn't I see that witch in Costner's Robin Hood?I'll never get that hour and a half back. And so it goes..."
2,I HAVE WATCHED BETTER,"A bit too dated for my tastes and there are newer pieces about Rommel that dilute this film's originality. Mason is his usual self but I've seen him in far better roles. Here he's okay and you live or die by Mason's role as Rommel so this film was lackluster for me. WWII buffs will enjoy actual war clips and by the way the suicide ending and such is historically accurate. They really did give Rommel that choice. I personally feel there are better Rommel films out there that focus on his military abilities and the plan to assassinate Hitler: ""Five Graves To Cairo"", ""Night of the Generals"" and even Cruise in ""Valkyrie"". STORY/PLOTTING: C plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; PLOT TO KILL HITLER FOCUS: C plus; OVERALL GRADE: C plus to B minus. WHEN WATCHED: mid January 2012 (streamed)."
5,A Book that I can't live without!!,"Simply put, if you are a wordsmith or wordlover and you still don't have this anthology, what are you waiting for?Langston Hughes came out of a very influential artistic era in US History. The music, the dancing, the costomes, the nightclubs, the poetry all became one!You will find yourself going back to this book over and over again! These verses are among some of the greatest in American Literary History!DOn't take it from me, read it for yourself, this book is a must have! Enjoy it like a fine wine!"
1,Not good at all!!!,"It is a miracle if you get this device running on your pc, I had to uninstall the software that comes with it because it was causing a lot of trouble with the OS, try another one..."
1,The support for this product is really poor,"The support for this product is very poor. For example, the driver for this product is not available for download from their website. After contacting the support they pointed me to a FTP download site which never works. I simply don't understand why such a simple thing should be so complicated."
1,Don't buy this Case !!,"No way to buy this kind of case for C series. The case is too bad. The camera did no fit..almost no close.The case is very small, no space for batteries or cables, nothing, is just a trick.I will be returning it.Mario Cuadra"
4,Everyone loves it!,I bought this to put on my fridge so my friends would have something to play with when they came over. The real challenge with this is to come up with something not dirty!
1,Hoaky,"HORRIBLE! STUPID! HOAKY! This is Kenner's WORST idea ever! The voices are horrible! I wish I could give it 0 stars in educational value and how fun it is. I reccommend that no one who is intrested in not wasting money should buy this. Of all of the voices, the worst is Battle Droid."
5,The Best Way to Play,"If you're a collector or a player this device works for you. Figures talk and interact with each other. TALK about fun. The more figures you have, the better it gets. Which I think was Hasbros idea (to get you to buy more figures). The only bad part is that some chips don't sound like the characters in the movie. It's really great to play a line in front of someone who has never heard of it before. Example:(Battle Droid) ""Halt you're under arest"". And Qui-Gon Jinn's line ""May the force be with you"" is perfect for the answering machine. This thing is a great gift for any kid (Just make sure you get a couple of figures to). I only have one suggestion for Hasbro, next time put more save spaces on it."
3,Getting better with the POTF figures,"When this first came out at a price of $20(or however much it was a year ago), I said to myself that I would not be getting this UNLESS they did COMMtech chips for POTF figures. No way was I gonna spend $20 on this!Well, I broke that rule. I bought it when it had been discounted to $10. But I was not too impressed with it. Some of the chips were OK- giving off good lines and sounds. They improved as the figures came out. But the majority sounded nothing like who they were supposed to be.Then came the breakthrough: Power of the Force COMMtech chips! Now these were the real deal. Han, Luke, Greedo, more are coming out after Leia, Darth Vader, and Admiral Motti. Next up Porkins, Obi-Wan, and Chewie(playing chess)"
2,Could have been better,"This was a good idea, but bad product. The voices are hard to understand and/or do not sound correct. There is a need for improvement. I don't see much point with it. New thought, will it work with Episode II toys or will a different one be needed?"
5,Big Jake,"Great movie. Husband loved the Christmas presets, he is a John Wayne movie collector. Still looking for more. Try them"
3,Good Movie - Questionable Ending,"I have seen this movie several times, but the thing that prevents me from adding it to my collection is the ending. While I have always condsidered it one of the better J.Wayne flicks, the end always left a bad taste in my mouth. Two of the main charaters were an Indian (a long time friend of Big Jake's) and his dog (named Dog by the way). Without giving away to much I'll say that they do not make the ride back home. Although both were pretty intergral to the film, they are dismmissed almost as minor characters at the film's end. This may not bother others, but both the Indan charcter and the dog were protrayed as extremely loyal to Big Jake throughout the movie. It seemed extremely illogical that the upright and heroic character of Big Jake would have walked away so easily from them both considering the relationship portrayed between them in the film. The film's worth seeing, but this flaw kept it from being a better western."
4,A Classic Film...,"There's not much I can say that probably hasn't already been said about this film, but I must say the acting is very strong, the scenes are breathtaking, and the plot is a well- told story of a legendary actual queen.Cleopatra was told in the most honest way in this film, a woman who had great dreams and had the faith that they would work out and yet of course they don't in most ways and she has to deal with the disappointments along with her fellow men. I found Taylor to be a great queen in this film, and very beautiful.I know why this film is very loved. It is well- done and told with great respect. I highly recommend this film."
5,One of the best epics ever made!,"I can't really add much to some of the wonderful reviews I have read about this DVD set (the 5 Star Collection). But I do want to say that if you love this movie or even just like this movie, the documentary that is included with this 3-disc set is worth buying this DVD set just by itself. It's one of the most entertaining and interesting documentaries I've ever seen on the making of a movie and all the interesting and strange events that happened while making the movie and after the movie. The movie is absolutely beautiful - the sets and costumes are magnificent - the money spent on this film is so obvious. I wish they would restore this movie to the director's original plan and put back the other half of the movie that was cut out! I would pay lots of money to buy a director's cut of this movie. But until that day comes, if ever, I highly recommend this DVD set. It's still one of my favorite movies of all time. My rating: A"
3,"Good movie, bad extra features disc",I have seen this movie several times and purchased it to obtain the disc with extra features. The disc would not play due to something being on it that I was unable to remove. I would like to know if there is a way to obtain the extras disc without flaws.Thank you.
4,Gorgeous Cleopatra,"This Blu-Ray version of Cleopatra is gorgeous. All of the opulence was beautifully transferred. Unfortunately, the film suffers from its ""soap opera"" quality, but not enough to detract from reveling in the fun of watching Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and Rex Harrison do what they do best."
1,WARNING: UK FORMAT ONLY; WILL NOT PLAY ON US BLU RAY PLAYER,I got this for Christmas this year and was disappointed to find that it didn't play on my Blu Ray Player. I'm annoyed this is being sold on the US store if it doesn't play on US Blu Ray players.
3,Minor arias from major works,"Usually ""excerpts"" concern the well known arias from various operas, this DVD constitutes however an exception. Whithin the major operas sung by great singers ... you get the least well known arias of these same operas. If you are NOT a confirmed opera fan, you might just as well choose another DVD to get your initiation."
4,nice,"These glasses arrived safely although they are obviously fragile. The shipping looks very secure.Washing them is going to be a little tricky though because they are deep and the opening is too narrow for me to put 4 fingers in like I usually do for rinsing out glasses... but it's ok, they are beautiful."
1,Spiegalau Wine Glasses,"Of the three boxes I ordered, over 35% arrived broken. When Amazon replaced the broken glasses, the new box arrived with 2 of 6 glasses broken."
1,Lower Price Means Lower Quality,"These glasses were given to me as a gift. I used them without thinking much about it until recently, when at a friend's home I experienced the Riedel Bordeaux glasses. The difference in quality and design was notable, and especially the shape of the Riedel glasses makes the wine taste better. I immediately gave away these Spiegelau glasses and bought several sets of Riedel. The Spiegelau glasses are comparatively thick and not the optimum shape. Spiegelau is better than what you'd find in Wal-Mart, but if you're going to spend money on fine wine glasses because you appreciate the wines you'll be drinking from them, I recommend you spend a bit more and spring for the Riedel."
5,SeeMoreBuds 15lbs in 80 days,"Incredible... WOW...This is exactly what I wanted to see from a how to grow video. I watched the dvd for the first time with 2 beginner growers and 1 expert and we were all beside ourselves. We all learned a lot and most importantly, we gained the confidence to GO FOR IT!!My favorite part was SeeMore showing how easy it is to maintain a big or small garden. GOOD JOB This movie is a 10.., I highly recommend itOne final note, I ordered the dvd in the morning and it arrived the next day!"
4,Excellent source for the interested visitor,"The copy outlines the significant areas of the battle very well. Regardless of your level of expertise, it is easy to follow the progress of the battle. Although the maps are clear and show topographical features, they do not include the roads added since the battle. However, there is a segment on the Battlefield Today that brings the past and present into focus. Overall, this is an excellent source. Buy it if you can find it."
3,interesting read,"It was an interesting read as we were traveling across the old roads of route 66 however, there was not much information that was helpful. We stayed at a motel in the midwest that was recommended but, it cost much much more than was indicated in the book and was on of the worst motels I have ever stayed in. Take the book as entertainment only."
2,Not recommended,I didn't like it. Not much happened and the funny parts weren't funny. Read something else.
4,Great writer at his most average,"There is little plot, other than the hunting, which I just didn't care about. I liked his analysis of his contemporaries, and American writers in general, but that was a high point that came too early. If you want Hemingway greatness in a hunting story, check out The Snows of Kilimanjaro.Only true Hemingway enthusiasts would enjoy this. The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms are great starters if you're just getting introduced."
4,A must read for anyone going on an African safari!,"One of only 2 nonfiction books Hemingway wrote, I previously ignored this book. However, in anticipation of a 10 day safari in Tanzania, I bought and read it. I must confess that at home, its impact was lost on me. After I arrived in the game park, I re-read it and enjoyed it immensely. Hemingway captures the essence of Africa in a way that only he can do. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone contemplating a trip to Africa."
2,GREEN HILLS OF AFRICA,"NOT THE BEST ERNEST HEMINGWAY HAS WRITTEN ON THIS SUBJECT OF HUNTING ON THE DARK CONTINENT, BUT IT IS A TRUE STORY OF HIM AND HIS WIFE MARY ON SAFARI FOR A MONTH WITH OTHER SHOOTERS."
4,"Fun, amusing game.","I am a teenager, and I really enjoyed this game. In Dogs Life, you control a dog, Jake, who is trying to find his friend. If you win some of the games, you can control another dog for a limited amount of time. Here are some of the pros and cons of the game:Pros:*easy to move Jake around.*if you are bored, you can always collect smells*you can meet and talk to different people*you can use or not use a memory card and it is fun both waysCons:*is not really that inappropriate to be rated teen*you sometimes have to find items for someone like eggs or batteries and that can get a little tiresome."
1,"Short, little, small, tini, tiny, itsy, bitsy, and extreamly small!","I think the title of this review made my review. The game is really short! I'm just warning you! Even though it's fun to play around as a dog, it isn't worth $20 for it! It might be worth $5, but it isn't. Trust me. Don't think I'm a conartist, because I'm not. I hope I saved you $20 dollars. Thank you for listening to my warning, even though you probally didn't even believe me, because I heard almost the same exact thing from someone else, and I didn't even bother."
4,Great product!,"This keypad was exactly what I was looking for. It appears very well made. I like the feel of the keys, very similar to the keyboard keypad.I was really pleased that it doubles as a calculator with just the press of a button, I can easily toggle back and forth. Make sure you read the instruction booklet - this product has lots of other capabilities. I also found the additional USB ports at the top very useful. Definitely a good buy!"
2,Not that great,"This item is not a stand-alone calculator. It must be plugged in to the computer to use the calculator feature. For some reason, it times out. It is very annoying when you try to enter numbers and you realize that the thing has timed out. I'm not sure why they designed it to do this. It's not like there is a battery that is running down (as I mentioned, it must be plugged in to use). It works pretty well if you can deal with the timing out thing. I'm going to live with it even though it bothers me. The users manual is pretty weak too. It doesn't provide much in the way of instructions. Perhaps the Spanish, French or Dutch instructions are more descriptive. Too bad I can't read those."
3,A strange way to see the world,"Baseball. Porn. Prostitution. Bodybuilding. Our hero destroyed a chance at reaching the peak in all of these. This story is about addiction, with asides in varying depths in each topic. Read it if you are or know someone in that world, or if you want a view of someone who crashed each potential career short of what it might have been. (Whether you consider baseball a legitimate career compared to the others or not, the story holds. ;8). The questionable order of its unfolding, repetitive themes, and frustrating choices are right from the junkie's mind. Nobody said this was pretty."
1,Product image misrepresents actual item,"This is a great, reasonably priced album for those of us with large prints who are finding it difficult to find suitable albums from brick and mortar stores. I have zero complaints about product quality and as for durability, only time will tell. However, I am very upset that the product image shows a silver border pattern on the cover and the actual album I received has a plain black cover. The ONLY reason I chose black over the Midnight Blue and Burgundy colors is the silver decorative border shown here on the black version. I am considering returning them (I ordered two) in exchange for other colors."
3,john wayne again,"typical John Wayne movie..fights, scenery, girls, macho talk. But, for a Wayne fan, it has everything that one would want in a movie. Fabian is miscast as is Ernie Kovaks, who is terrible. Plot weak, filming great but...where is the snow in Alaska? Flawless in period-setting sets."
4,movie review,"I love this movie because it portrays an example of Christ's influence on various peoples lives, from kings to commoners and everyone in between. I thought it a perfect depiction of the conflict between man's conscience and the conviction of Christ's spirit. helps if you like Victor Mature also"
3,The Robe,"Sadly disappointing. Some fact mingled with fiction, not really what I expected... Hollywood's version of post-crucifixion events. The reality far supercedes anything Hollywood could trump up."
1,THE ROBE,Highly disappointed. The video played but half way through the movie it stopped and I still have not been able to watch the entire movie. I wasted my money on this one.
5,I never got this-,I have the Robe with Richard Burton - but not this DVD- it would be with all my others of the same interest...I never recieved this movie of the Robe-
1,Hard one to call,"This film is so embarassingly bad that it can almost be a camp classic, which is why it is difficult to decide whether to give it one or five stars. The painted sets are dreadful, the acting laughably pathetic, but biggest golden turkey has to go to one of the most nonsensical screenplays I have ever experienced. I absolutely howled with laughter at some of the scenes, the unintentional homo-eroticism at times reminding one of the cheapest of cheap gay porn. The reason why the one star instead of the five won through, was that the amusement eventually became irritation, as the film far outstays its camp potential. I know a lot of people will argue that the film dates from the fifties and can therefore not be judged by today's standards, but please: there are some truly great films from that age. This one is merely a badly timed joke."
1,too easily broken,"I have a habit of wiping the edge of my wine glass during dinner. When I wiped one of these with the edge of a soft napkin, the glass broke."
2,What to expect when your expecting,"seemed funny from commercials, not as funny when watching the movie. Very predictable, and very drawn out. Hated the step mom, pregnancy real for the step mom's daughter in law. Completely fake for the step mom."
4,Was not expecting this to be so good!,"This movie not only had the expected funny parts about pregnancy, it had some surprisingly tender moments that overall led to making this a very enjoyable movie for us to watch as a couple with kids!"
2,Boring!!!,"Funny in only few spots, wish they thought a little more about these stories. I think the man in this movie didn't fit."
4,Surprisingly good,This movie was far better than the previews. Funny and real. Warning - it has some harsh moments that may be hard for anyone who has struggled for their take home baby.
2,waste of time,Another Hollywood movie full of immorality. Motherhood is a beautiful vocation and this film does little to express it's importance and beauty.
3,Fun way to kill a couple hours.,"My husband was working late and I was looking for a way to pass the time. This was a fun movie but most definitely a chick flick, I would never subject my husband to this movie or any movie like this."
3,OK,this movie wasn't what I was expecting. Again they should have done so much better. It is ok if you just want to watch something.
4,Entertaining!,"Great movie for a Saturday afternoon. The ensemble cast is fun and as a resident of Atlanta, it was fun to see the city on the big screen."
2,Find another movie to watch,"What to expect when you're expecting to watch this movie, its boring, with a couple of laughs, bad acting. Rent/buy another movie."
2,not a good one,this movie even though it had a good cast was not a winner in my book..it took a while to get going..and even then was still all over the place..the cutest parts were when u seen babies..my husband and i wont watch it again..and we certainly wont buy it..
3,chace crawford boring,"As in 2 other recent movies including ""Twelve"" all duds at boxoffice, chace crawford proves once and for all he is poison at the boxoffice"
4,GUYS!!! The Girls will thank you and you will enjoy it,"Here's The Lowedown on ""What to Expect When Your Expecting"" (A Comedy/Date Movie DVD review)...LIKED IT!!!Look for ""The Lowedown"" on Facebook snd become a fan...Genre: 8 Movie: 7What's it about?A look at love through the eyes of five interconnected couples experiencing the thrills and surp...rises of having a baby, and ultimately coming to understand the universal truth that no matter what you plan for, life doesn't always deliver what's expected.What did I think?This was a pleasant surprise for me. Not my style for sure, and I wouldn't have watched it had it not been for the review. Now I can say not only did I like it, but I think I might buy the movie. I would definitely watch this movie again...without being at gunpoint."
2,"Not impressed, expected more....",I was not pleasantly surprised by this movie. I expected it to be at least slightly funny. It is just average.
3,ehh..,"it wasnt bad, but wasnt good either... idk, personal opinion..no issues with playno issues with purchaseno issues at all!"
2,it was on sale,"the reviews were great, but it was on sale. And I thought, why not. Well, now i know why and it wasn't even worth the sale price. but i guess at least it was on sale."
1,I have received a DVD that will not let me play in my country it has the wrong code for my DVD player,"Its not that I hate it, the problem is I simply cannot play it in my DVD player as it says the DVD has the wrong country code for my DVD player."
2,It was O.K.,To predictable no surprises and a lot of bitchy women blah blah blah just not worth the rental price really
3,Ok movie with descent story,"It's a fairly entertaining movie, but after having a baby it's hard to take movies about pregnancy seriously since they are so unrealistic. It's a descent date movie, but there are better ones out there."
5,Very funny and touching,I enjoyed this movie but it could be more because I was 6 weeks pregnant. All the stories were touching and there were a ton of funny moments.
3,This movie was okay.,"There were parts of this movie that were funny and/or cute but I would not watch it again. Of course, maybe a mother and/or pregnant woman could relate so much more."
3,Great cheese.,"Flawless cheese, from the dated styles to the overblown performances. ""In the water I'm a very skinny lady,"" indeed. Don't expect anything smart or real; it's just fun."
3,Why a mono soundtrack on the DVD?,"The film was released in theaters in stereo surround, and my THX certified laserdisc is in stereo surround, so why did they introduce the DVD in mono? Booooo!"
3,Poseidon Adventure - VHS,I had seen this movie when it first came out and wanted to see it again. After the second viewing some of the dialogue does not seem right.
3,Best I could find for cheap,"These are ok, but didn't quite work for the side of my fridge. The hook part was too long to make things easy to hook and unhook. But I was delighted when I found that my under cabinet lighting was magnetic, now the hooks hang upside down and I hang oven mitts or utensils on them. They won't hold a lot of weight this way though. I'm thinking of getting more to hang under my kitchens cabinets but I'd have to find more things to hang from them that would be handier from there vs wherever they are at right now. One hook will only hold one of my utensils, or two oven mitts. I've pulled down the hook with the mitts at least once when trying to grab a mitt."
5,Strong Enough,"What I really wanted was one of those magnet racks to hang my pot holders on the side of my refrigerator but could not find any to suite my purpose (refrigerators had to be smooth). So I bought a set of these individual magnet hooks and they have worked out fine for my needs. My refrigerator does not have a smooth surface so I was looking for magnets that did not require a refrigerator to have a smooth surface and these magnets work perfectly. They stay put where ever I place them--I have not had any of them to fall down even when I threaded 2 pot holders onto one hook. If I needed more magnet hooks, I would definitely order more of these."
