3,SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED?,"I have to admit that after viewing STAY I was disappointed in its muddled and oftentimes confusing plot. But thanks to several reviews here on Amazon, some points helped clarify what happened and I agree that the ending negated the movie's main proposition. With that in mind, there are many good things about this surrealistic venture. Ryan Gosling is especially good as Henry, having the soulfully sad face that contradicts a lot of his previous films. Ewan McGregor is also good in his role as the sympathetic and ultimately scary psychiatrist, and Naomi Watts is fine as always. The movie has some interesting cinematic techniques and although it's not totally clear, STAY is definitely an original experience."
3,Not Bad - Not Great,"I can't agree with those who are completely panning this movie. As others have said, it is not a horror movie like many of us expected, it is more of a psychological thriller with supernatural surrealism mixed in. If that description seems confusing to you, so will the movie. Some reviewers have pointed out this was an attempt to copy a David Lynch type movie, this one does not rise to that standard, but it is a good movie nonetheless.The kid who plays Henry gives a really good performance. He carries the movie and it is worth watching to see him. MacGregor and Watts perform well, it's just that their characters are not very exciting.This is not an easy to follow movie with a perfect chronological sequence, it is abstract and has alot of misdirection in it, and in my opinion there are still some loose ends at the end of the movie. If this isn't your kind of movie, you will probably hate it, if it is your kind of movie you will appreciate it and the kids performance."
2,Story that I had expected was very different,"Now I'm curious about mental disease.So I bought this because I thought this is a kind of film like ""girl interrupted"" or ""above the nestle""This story could be arresting as it could make you confuse.But it's very ambiguous.I can't express with words what this film is.It was like day dream.But it's involved several people at the same time."
1,Pure garbage,"This enclosure is pure garbage, it didn't work at all and it heated up to the point of burning my hand. I sent it back right away. Avoid this product and buy a quality one, it's not worth the risk to your hard drive or your health. If I hadn't grabbed the hard drive and burned my hand, there could have been a fire. My new enclosure works perfectly with the same hard drive. STAY AWAY!!"
2,fast but small,"I bought this external case to use it with a 200GB laptop disk, the problem? the enclosure is small (thin) and I can not insert the disk in it, I can still use the disk connecting only the electronic piece to it (the top cover with the USB connection) So, if you have a big capacity laptop hard drive and it is a little ""FAT"" DO NOT buy this enclosure.On the other hand the disk performs very well with this unit. I transfered to it 10.5GB in like 7 minutes.Hope it helps, Carlos."
1,don't buy !!!,"I owned a lacie for 5 years and still works good. This piece of junk lost its back poorly attached plastic cap and the enclosure crap collapsed on the disk that, at the time, is not recognized anymore. ONE WEEK!May 'god' hardly punish STARTECH if I can't get my HD back! :)"
5,WorkS GreAt!!!,"My segate 500gb enclosure broke and i had 300gb of data on it, I bought this to try to recover and it works better than the original. Now i do not have to buy an new external, great choice !!!"
1,Incompatible pin configuration,This enclosure does not work for a Dell M4400 Precision laptop. The laptop hard drive containes four pins for which there is no receptacle in this enclosure. It would be nice if the sellers would disclose the exceptions up front rather then wait for the consumer to discover the issue after the fact.I did receive prompt delivery of the order.
3,"Beware of drive size limitation, 160GB Max","I initially used this device as a means of cloning my old drive onto a newer drive in my laptop. It worked great. The old drive was a 160GB, and the new drive in the laptop was a 320GB.I've since tried doing the opposite since I was going to try and install Windows 7 on the old drive and then swap the images again. NO GO! The Enclosure will not support the larger drive.In referencing Startech's website and the product manual it actually indicates Hard Drive support of 120GB, however as I mentioned above it does supports 160GB.Bottom line I wish the drive limitation was more clear in the Amazon specs."
4,very good,"I think it could be better, but because of the low budget, and the unprofessional director, or the camera man, it could be better movies, but the money I paid for it, I think it is worth it."
1,Get a TiVo!,"For about twenty bucks more, you can get yourself a TiVo and record shows to be watched later, use ""trick play"" like pause, fast-forward and rewind, and instant replay. Not to mention the fact that you can skip commercials! TiVo has a programming guide that runs TWO WEEKS in advance, so you could see whats coming on two fridays from now. If you need a real remote, pick up a Sony universal remote and buy yourself a TiVo, it's well worth it. I guarantee that you'll never even use another remote besides your TiVo's!180 bucks is a joke for this remote. A Phillips Pronto is a much cooler remote for the price. Stay away from this remote!"
1,"If you have a suicide in your immediate family, don't watch this movie.","The beginning of the movie is visually exciting and has some interesting metaphors. Alas, after that, it just wanders around grasping at allegory. It's sort of wacky. Sometimes it's almost funny. I wish that Jerry Lewis hadn't agreed to do this -- he can be so funny, but in this one, it just seemed needy and grasping.Oh yes -- having had a suicide in my immediate family, that plot thread dampened my excitement - sort of scary actually. Some nice scenery -- I like the dogs.Maybe I should have just read the book. (lame joke - this couldn't have enough plot contiguity to make a book out of it)."
4,Axel & Paul,"This movie is quirky and funny and touching, though sometimes a little contrived. Johnny Depp really shows his stuff as Axel, however, and the chemistry between him and his cousin, Paul, played by Vincent Gallo, is excellent. Definitely worth seeing, especially for Gallo's local talent show reenactment of the crop-dusting scene from North by Northwest."
4,From NYC to Arizona !,"""Arizona dream"" works out above all, as an admirable metaphor, an urban fable, aroused from a simple fact, when a hotshot in New York I tricked about a business in which his own uncle is involved.Once he arrives to Arizona he will meet a very eccentric and out of context woman: This expected romance with the admirable Arizona's landscapes as big frame will ignite of surrealistic poetry.Before you bet for this film, I think you should be aware about the particular aesthetics of this connoted filmmaker, whose non linearity and powerful dreamy style at the moment to tell a story will allow you to enjoy with major pleasure this emotive love story, hovered by sarcastic lines all the way through."
5,from cradle to rave,"Overiding premise is get on with it...we all know that numbers work when making your calls...Joe manages to add finesse and skill to the process.....get that phone out of the cradle and start putting Joes army of good ideas on the battlefield.Eamon CollMortgage BrokerVictoria,BC,Canada"
4,"Lots of tips, lots of typos, lots of contradictions","Overall, I would say it is a good book for non-sales people to buy. Joe points out many things to think about and makes many good suggestions.Two things bother me about the book:- It has numerous typos and grammatical errors. Sometimes I've had to re-read sections to understand what he meant to say.- There are several contradictions. One example is on page 25. He says: ""If they don't return your call, wait two days before calling back."" But then 2 sentences later says that you should leave a voice mail stating: ""If I don't hear back from you by the end of the day, I'll try back before I leave the office.""Personally, I don't want to buy from a sales person that doesn't do what they say they are going to do, so this is a really poor suggestion and really poor customer service (especially if the person you are calling really does want to talk to you)!"
4,Nice Chill CD,"I'm a painter and need long tracks to listen to while I paint, in order to keep a groove going for at least as long as a track lasts... (often looping one track if it hits the right nerve and keeping it going for over an hour). This CD is GREAT to paint to... a tiny bit repetitive but still very good.If you are a painter and know what I'm talking about, there are other great CDs to buy that do this as well, Steve Tibbetts (a fantastic, somewhat obscure musician and highly underrated) being one of the best examples as some of his are just one long continuous journey that you can get lost in. He has many CDs here as well."
2,It's a disapointment,"Just so everyone knows...I am a Pantera fan through and through. I loved down, thought is was different, but loved it. But when it came time for listening to SJR I was dissapointed. I expected something better honestly. I seemed like every song seemed the same, and there was no variation in guitar sounds. The thing I like about Pantera and Down was the variations in songs, SJR, none. I'm really sorry I bout it. Maybe they'll redeem themselves sometime down the road."
5,Another awesome Phil album,"Forget Ozzy, this album futher proves that Phil Anselmo is the metal god. It seems like he can't do any wrong. With current metal kings, Pantera, getting slower at putting out albums, Phil and Company have done something awesome. Most of these tracks were written in the early to mid 90's. I'm very glad they decided to release them whether as Pantera or Superjoint tracks doesn't matter. This album is close to Pantera's 'Trendkill style of play. Its very heavy from beginning to end. There is no ""filler"" stuff here, just fast hard agression."
3,Decent Can Opener,"Decent can opener. I've had it about a month. Seems to work fine. The only complaint that I have is that the handle is made of plastic. This is usually a weak spot for can openers. So far though, this has not been a problem."
4,great can opener,"so far so good. seems to work right, is well made and that's all I really want out of a can opener."
5,Can Opener,I love this can opener. It opens cans with such ease. Well built and good size which makes using it a pleasure! A+
1,Shame for the 3rd edition,"The 3rd edition is published in 2002, but still has an extensive coverage on Coherent communication and Soliton. What a shame! Anybody knows that coherent communication and Soliton are dead since WDM became commercial deployment in 1996. On other hand, the author did not cover anything applications which are succefully beaten the coherent communication and Solition and are widely applied in the current optical communication systems (e.g., CRZ, DPSK modulation, high capacity DWDM....). It seems the author is not in touch with the industry for many years and is repeating the older and dead topics.Moreover the software contained in the CD-ROM is completely useless."
4,Works for me.,"I've had this garlic press for three years, and it does exactly what it's supposed to do. As far as garlic presses go, this one is not spectacular, but it does a fine job.As far as the price, it is a little bit pricey, but it feels solid and works."
3,Required novel,"Purchased for a class and the book was not that bad, would have read it on my own. Good book."
1,Ranting and raving,"Don't waste your money on the ranting and raving of Mr. Corydon. I think he is just mad that he didn't come up with the ideas Mr. Hubbard did.Instead, read what Hubbard wrote, and make your own decision of his ideas and decide if these can help you in your own life."
5,Tan Dun - what more can you say...,Tan Dun is wonderful !If you love Crouching Tiger soundtrack you will love this - in fact one song on this CD has the exact drum beat as one from CTHD. It is a little on the short side but a fitting score to an aewsome movie.
3,"Adorable, but......","This item is adorable and different from you ordinary hummingbird feeder. However, the plastic bottom leaked. I had to put white teflon tape (plumber's tape) around the bottom to stop the leaking."
2,not iphone charger,The A61 will not charge iphones although it looks like it will and usb cables will charge both. The A61 really only charges Ipods.
5,Yoga Pant,"These are so comfortable, 95% cotton. I love it that the waist can be rolled down, they can be worn however you want. I ordered a size bigger than I normally wear due to the snug fit. If you wear size large, purchase size XL. The XL is not baggy at all, they fit perfectly.Yes they are too long but you can always cut them off. I would definitely order more. I hope this review helps."
1,Women's Stretch Cotton Yoga Pant,"I wear a medium in pants. I ordered this pants in a large because I wear a lumbar back brace. I couldn't even get these pants up to my knees. They were like a size small. The sizing is so off, I would not know what size to order. I have several other pairs of pants like these and I wear medium or large in them with brace. Totally disappointed."
3,TOO TIGHT,"I weigh 98 pounds, at 5'2', and these are so tight in the waist they make me feel sick. I have to fold the top down to my hips, Something can be snug without strangling. I think this must have been a mistake, except leggings by this company are very small waisted too. When someone whose weight doesn't top one hundred pounds can't wear the pants comfortably, who can?"
5,product,"I ordered these yoga pants for a gift. after i placed the order, the person notified me she had told me the wrong size. the first order came to me in amazing time. i sent them back and got my 2nd order just as quick. everything was handled wonderfully. i am very impressed w/this ordering site and will purchase items in the future...........good job!!!!!!"
2,They rip like paper.,"I wore them and they were super comfortable. Since i am 5'3"", they were LONG on me. They rip very easily and are rather cheap, I do NOT recommend them."
1,disappointed,"Love, love, love my kitchenaid. Hate the paddle. Mine also is cracking and peeling away. Had hoped it was a fluke. Now read it has happened to others. There are just some things you cannot make with the whisk, so have to buy a replacement - but disappointed I have to already."
5,The classics,"When (and since) I was in college (a LONG time ago) reading the ""classics"" has been de-emphasized. This is a mistake. Now, in my 60s, I am finally reading works like this one, and learning just how much I have missed."
3,Not Half Bad but needs more soul singers,"The Isley Brothers Taken To The Next cover/remix album isn't half bad it's just that with some soul singers doing the singing it could have been better. The CD starts out with good with Will I Am hip hop take on Tell Me When You Need Me and other standout tracks include De La Soul on It's A New Thing and Rapahel Saidiq on Harvest For The World. The great big killer is saved for last with Mos Def turning ""Groove With You"" into the title-says-it-all ""Beauty in the Dark; A throwback that's as funky as the original; that's incredible. Personally I would have artisits like Silk or Usher on Between The Sheets and Musiq or Bilai could have killed Choosey Lover. For some real soul check Stokely's cover of Make Me Say It Again Girl and Riff's Take on Voyage To Atlantis."
2,just ok,nothing adds anything to the Isley Brothers sound.I don't like Projects like this because how can anyone truly improve upon the Original?
4,The Moonlight Man,"The Moonlight Man is a great book.Would you like a goodghost story?It's best to read it at night or on Halloween.It isabout when Allie,Jenny,and April move into a new neighborhood.But strange things happen when they are alone,like footsteps, awhistling,and also crying.Want to know more?Buy it.This is agood book."
4,This is a good book.,This book is about a girl named Jenny and her family. Her mother died when Jenny and her sister were little. Then her father keeps moving because he keeps finding things that are wrong with the house that they move in too. The house they live in now is in the Cresent Lane. Jenny and her sister Ally keep hearing footsteps upstairs. They keep seeing this guy and a dog in their back yard. Their house is haunted and so is the house next door. I recommend this book to Junior High girls. I like this book. It was good.
5,"Thoughtful, insightful, inspiring reading.","To Know God: Small Group Exercises For Spiritual Formation by Michael Gemignani (rector of St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Freeport, Texas) offers twelve flexible, insightful group sessions to help individuals help one another understand and embrace spiritual direction in their lives. Sessions explore such topics as the nature of sin, opening one's mind to God through meditation, the true meaning of the Crucifixion, and much more. To Know God is very highly recommended not just for spiritual discussion group leaders, but also for anyone ready to do some deep thinking to better understand their relationship with God."
3,The 3rd edition was never published,"I just thought I would point out that the third edition of ""Mastering Mathematica"" by J. W. Gray does not, as far as I can tell, exist. A search in the WorldCat library catalog shows a ""ghost record"" of this title, but no library in the world owns a copy. If it had ever been released, there would be actual references to this 3rd edition in writings by others that can be found online, but only references to the two earlier editions are cited.The last edition was the 2nd and, although once an excellent resource, is now severely dated:Mastering Mathematica, Second Edition: Programming Methods and Applications"
4,"I have used this book for my 200 level psy. course, great",I have used this book for my 200 level course in Human Growth & Development at our local community college and the students have said how much they have enjoyed the book and the course. The authors took the time to include information about many different cultures and this was very helpful.
5,Great zester,Gives nice thin strips of peel. Easy to use and clean. Love it for lemon and orange peel.
4,paintlady,"fun to watch--more fun than informative, although I did learn some things about wine culture.One CAN have fun and learn at the same time."
5,Humorous and educational,Love it! Quite humorous with wine education also! New to wine and wine sobs alike will enjoy.Sit back with a glass of wine and enjoy!
2,Horrible,"Frankly I thought the book was horrible, with no real practical wisdom being shared in an understandable way.The content seems a bit outdated and the book is full of photos of the author gang-cutting rafters with a chainsaw and bragging about how many roofs he's framed in the 'california housing tract.'To be fair, I thought it was horrible probably because I couldn't be bothered to try to understand most of the math and geometry. I was looking for a book with more simple and practical explanations mainly on how to mathematically calculate roof framing.I found the book ""measuring, marking and layout"" to be much more helpful and valuable, as well as several other books on roof framing specifically. I would not recommend this book to anyone and see no reason for its usefulness whenthere are so many other more coherent and generous sources."
3,"Great idea, short life","I purchased 6 of these at SAM's club, and really like the idea of having a night light double as a back up when the power goes out. Unfortunately, like many other have noted, the rechargeable battery died in all of them within a year. I still use them as nightlights, but wouldn't have bought them if I knew they wouldn't last very long. I really love the idea, if they could figure out a way to change the battery in it once a year (like your smoke detector) I think these would be a great product (5 stars)."
1,Short lifetime,"I liked these lights when I first got them -- the nightlight is not overly bright, and the flashlight was good enough to actually use. The first problem was merely annoying; the plug is place in such a way that this light covers both outlets of a duplex fixture. The second problem is the killer, though. As a number of reviewers pointed out, the batteries die in 6-8 months, and are not replaceable. I'd unfortunately gotten a number of these, and now have an expensive disposal problem."
1,Doesn't last,I bought 3 of these for my boat and they only lasted a few months. The batteries are not user replaceable and when they fail to charge the device is useless.
1,Junk!,"If you love wasting money and filling up your trash can then this is a wonderful product! I bought 4 of them about 5 months ago and today threw out the last one. I used to trust Sylvania but not any more, a company so big and well established knows how to test a product and it seems they also think they can make a profit selling junk."
1,Dim useless flashlight,I bought 4 or these. All 4 were useless as a flashlight after a few months. Initially the flashlight was fine but after a few months the leds emit a useless dim glow. The night light is good.
2,power failure lite.,"It isnt nearly bright enough for any room to be lit up if the lights go out. It will be a great nite lite, that's it."
1,one of the worst products I never buy,"I buy a 3 pack of these thing. I connected all of them in differents parts of my house the same night. At the morning two of them burned out together with the outlet. The third one works partially. Served as an backup light only the first week.It leave me with a bad taste, for continuing shopping by internet."
1,Worthless,"These are absolutely worthless and Sylvania knows it. I bought three and two wouldn't hold a charge from the start. The third held charge for a few months but then died. I complained to Sylvnaia and they sent several coupons. Unfortunately, I used some to buy replacement units....which also turned out to be defective. If you want expensive nightlights buy them but don't count on the flashlight working when you need it."
4,Don't let thePigeon Stay Up Late,My kids love this series of books and the newest edition did not disappoint them.
3,Not a big fan,"Before I begin, I must admit that I have yet to read ""DON'T LET THE PIGEON DRIVE THE BUS"". That said, I must also tell you that after reading this, I am in no hurry to read the above mentioned. I guess this book is just too simple for my tastes. I do, however, see the kid appeal in it. I felt that some of the Pigeon's comments seemed more adult-like than kid-like. For instance, one excuse he uses to stay up is ""Y'know, we never get to talk anymore."" or ""What's five minutes in the grand scheme of things?"" But then, the author has won awards for these books, so who am I to judge? I think there are a lot of fun books out there for 4-8 year olds and this is not on the top of my list."
4,Good but..,"Could have been perfect. There are some dry parts to this guide but all in all it's a good, sound and worth it read."
3,Moderate rating,The book was weeks late when I really needed it. Yet the seller owned up to the mistake and corrected it. I understand these things happen.
5,Very Beautiful,"This is a very beautiful and high quality pendant and necklace, worth much more than the selling price. The sale price is great, there was no shipping fee, and for some reason I received a $2.60 off discount. The package came in about two business days, and in perfect condition.The gem color isn't exactly what it looks like in the picture; it's a bit lower-tone, but it is a very pretty, subtle blue, that would match well with any casual blue top. If you are looking for brighter, or more teal type of blue, I would suggest to look at the ""Swiss Cut Topaz"" which is identical and by the same company -- just search it. In conclusion, I'd like to say that I am very pleased with this necklace, and its company."
1,lukewarm coffee and condensation drips,"Terrible! So mad about wasting more money! Coffee was horrible and lukewarm. Had to microwave my milk to keep coffee above room temperature! Plus, when you open lid to fill, condensation runs all out of the machine top leaving a puddle of water under your electric machine every time you open top. Run!"
1,Only Lasted 8 1/2 months!,"I bought this coffeemaker at the end of August thinking it was a simple, no-nonsense coffeemaker. In mid-May, it started leaking from the vent at the bottom ... at first I thought I didn't have the carafe in correctly or that there was an obstruction with the filter ... after looking at it closely, I noticed a steady drip through the bottom of the coffeemaker. Not good."
1,Bad Product,I had a great coffee machine for years and should not have replaced it with a peice of junk. This is the second one I bought because it was cheap. The first one lasted about 2 weeks. I never take time to do reviews but have a deadline and a 3 yr old that woke up at 5:30 and no coffee :(. Spend the money and buy something that won't conk out on you.
1,B & D Blew This One,"I heard about the Smart Brew pots on America's Test Kitchen. They talked about it brewing at the right temperature and being inexpensive. They were right about the coffee it makes, it's good. But, like other reviewers pointed out, this thing is junk. I haven't had all the problems others have had, but the spring popping out when cleaning and the "" dribble pot "" syndrome makes this coffemaker a loser. Like another reviewer I will buy another pot and keep this one for backup. My biggest mistake is, that I walked into a store and purchased it. The right way is to find a possible product, come here to Amazon and check out the reviews first. There isn't a better way to check out a product than to read all of the reviews here."
1,B&D Junk,"All the B&D coffee makers are junk - at least all I've used or heard about. The one I have stops intermittently during the brew cycle, the rim on the hot plate cracked after just 1 month, you have to use more coffee than with other coffee makers and it takes about 12 minutes to make 6 cups of coffee."
1,"Terrible, Do Not Buy","After taking 20 billion cds and 4 years to install, it stilled didn't run right, and overall it is TERRIBLE... Do Not buy this... Pictures are general, no 3d shots, OVERALL a really bad product"
1,Stay Away,"We have been using Brightstore (CA) products for the last 7 Years and that's about to change. Support is absolutely horrible beyond that of basic setup. TCO is very high for this product and reliability is not solid. We use Dell 128T and HP MSL5026 libraries, and we had to jump through a lot of hoops to get the software to run properly with very little help from support. The native database is extremely volatile and constant maintenance is needed to ensure good backups. I must admit running Brightstor with a single DLT drive connected to a server functions OK. But if you're going to be backing up High capacity, sensitive data, I would recommend spending the extra money for a higher end product. Poor support, weak web support, a lot of man hours, and unreliable with Tape libraries."
3,Jeopardy 2003,"This game is sometimes called Jeopardy 3 but on the box it's called Jeopardy 2003.I was surprised, that in Solo Mode, you are not told the answers to the questions!When you play with others or computer players, you are given the answers.The graphics and sound are pretty good. My main complaint with the game is the lack of options. You can't even pick the resolution you want to play in. There are no graphic options at all! Everything is choosen for you. There are a few options having to do with gameplay, like buzz in time 1-3 Players and such.I like to pick my own options and settings, thats's why only three stars. Otherwise the game is fun.It requires Direct X 8.1. System requirements are a minimum Pentium II 333Mhz but a Pentium III 500Mhz is recommended (32MB RAM for Win 98/ME/2000 but 64 for XP)and 200 MB Hard Drive Space.I also ordered Scrabble 2003 and Wheel Of Fortune 2003. I hope they have alot more options than Jeopardy 2003.M. Calcagno"
3,Disappointed In Quality,"This game can be very annoying because of the need to be specific to a certain degree much of the time. Only thing is, it is not consistent. For instance at times the answer would need to be Princess Diana and other times the answer should be Diana. Also, many times the question read aloud is NOT the one on the screen therefore your answer would be different than what is being said aloud. It crashes after 3 games almost like it is overheating and usually during a game. Last, I have found information incorrect in the game. When you put it to loose spelling it does not honor it sometimes counting me wrong with only one letter off where maybe I put a plural instead of a single. I was very disappointed in it."
2,Nicely written in minute patches,"For the most part, the writing in this books is derivative; if you have read roy enough, you recognize the phrases and writing style that is borrowed. Still there were patches in which I could briefly get immersed in the story without being troubled by echoes of other writers."
5,Even Better than the original,This remake of the 70ties top hit of Hot Chocolate is just one of the most swinging songs I ever heard this year on my local radio Studio Brussels.
1,Russet Brown is actually Army Green!,"The shorts are a nice fit and wear well, however as a warning, the color of the shorts are actually army green, not brown."
3,Time to upgade this book.,"The book is informative, but lacks essential elements in examples that are required in the chapter problems. More to the point: The examples in the chapters are way too simple compared to the problems at the end. This book definitely needs some updating to keep up with Wiley's standards. Not a keeper."
3,"Impressions on "" Rules of golf in Plain English)",I feel it is an excellent guide for the serious competition golfer with a bit too much detail for those of us who play social golf. Never the less it covers all the rules in detail including the penalties that apply for each of the types of games being played ie Matchplay Stroke etc.When the authors choose the title PLAIN English I was expecting a simple reminder of each of the rules with some typical examples of where players go wrong in interpreting rules in typical situations
1,contrite,"i found the characters to be completely unrealistic. A mother who thinks that she lost one of her children at birth spends the rest of her life feeling empty. Her husband, albeit a good man, hides the secret (that their child is alive) from her his entire life. come on, you must be joking. i kept reading the book thinking that the characters would become more ""real"" but it didn't happen. and, it's a long book!The husband was a good father to their son yet the sons spends his entire adolescent and adulthood hating the father. ridiculous! if, as in real life, the author would have simply let the boy go through what most adolescents do (disliking their parents) but then turning around in young adulthood, it would be so much more believable.very disappointing."
1,Disgusting Book,"This book started out very good. I was very curious what the author planned to do with the story line. To my disappointment it became far fetched, outrageous and actually disgusting. I would certainly not recommend it!"
2,draggy and depressing,"I was very disappointed in this book. I somewhat enjoyed the book during the first half, anticipating what my happen next to the characters. But about halfway through, the book really began to drag on and on, and the characters became more and more depressing. In the end, it just fizzled out.I was also disappointed by some of the odd mistakes in the book, which I'm surprised some editor did not catch. For example, toward the end of the book, Norah goes in to David's dark room, saying that it had been seven years since anyone had been in the room. But amazingly, she pulls a Coke from the refrigerator and drinks it. That must have been one stale Coke! I noticed several details like this in the book.Overall, very disappointing."
1,Major let down....,"I was expecting so much more from this book. I bought it because it was on the New York Times Best Sellers List. It was extremely boring and a huge let down. There was not one compelling moment in the book. The author even managed to make the emotional character moments boring and diluted. The foundation for this story was such a great idea, so I have a hard time understanding how it ended up being so boring. If you like a slow boring story, than this is the one for you."
2,Redundant,"This book got moving towards the middle and here I was thinking : ""Yes! It's finally going somewhere. But it was pointless, redundant and moved at the pace of a snail. I would call it a tedious read. I got so fed up that I didn't even finish the last chapter and that's a first for me. I was so let down because the subject of this novel is so interesting and controversial yet the finished product is a flop."
1,A dud that keeps on dudding.,"Boring, repetitious, unengaging,..a real snore! And a 'downer' to boot! Try something else."
1,Barely slogged through this ...,"I was really stunned (and mislead) by the positive reviews for this book, barely able to slog through to the end. The writing is trite, characters uninteresting. Several of my friends shared the same opinion."
2,so-so,"Many of my friends raved about this book. I was not impressed. The author went on and on and on about how screwed up everyone was, and it just got old. I was so ready to be finished with the book. I did like the ending and felt like the characters finally became 3 dimensional."
2,Disappointing ... to say the least ...,"I also bought this book because I had heard such great things about it. Like everyone else stated, the book started out strong but lost you half way through ...I was really disappointed by this book - wasn't what I thought it would be."
4,Memories good,"It is a good bookl, but got a bit slow in the middle. A good selectin for any book club."
2,Too long-so what?,"I'm sorry. This book just didn't do it for me? Where's the story? I found the characters very whiney. Why did Paul hate his father so? Even after David died, Paul whined & whined about what a horrible father he had. Get over it. He wasn't really that bad. David's childhood, Rosemary & Jack, Bree's reaction to Norah finding Pheobe, why did Norah leave for France so soon after finding Pheobe? There were too many loose ends. It was too long and nothing ever got resolved."
4,Compelling book,"I really enjoyed this book, though I found it hard to truly ""like"" all the characters. Still, it's an interesting story and keeps you turning the pages."
1,So boring....,"I have to say - it has been a longggg time since I have felt so strongly about not liking a book...It happened last night in bed, I am on page 131 and I threw the book across the room and screamed - ""this book sucks!"" Anyone else feel the same way?It is horribly boring - just read the summary and that should cover it. Characters are dull, plot is lame...shall I go on?"
2,"Starts off strong, and then...","A decent premise and a promising start fall prey to bizarre plot twists (including an unlikely hostage taking) and finally and lamentably, squishy stereotypes about people with Down Syndrome.Read the first half and then write your own ending. (Gee I wish the editor had done that!)"
3,"OK, but way too much hype.","I really liked the idea, even though a bit trite. Norah was a bit of a head case, but she succeeded in the end, kind of. This was fairly far-fetched, but do any of you have a better story line? I think so. I stuck it out to the end, but was disappointed with it. It kind of reads like a ""Indy Film"", more than a good read. Hollywood should snag this, it plays better as a 9pm movie than it does a book. All the loose ends tightly bundled at the end or you think. A lot of authors have wonderful ideas and I am not sure the ""Best Sellers"" list is all what it's cracked up to be."
4,Enjoyable,"I really enjoyed this book. The first two thirds of the book was mesmerizing; then it took a slightly disappointing turn toward the end. Nonetheless, I would recommend it as a ""worthwhile read."""
1,A Harlequin in everything but length,"I read this for a book club; otherwise I would have returned it to the library without reading past the second chapter. The author starts with a potentially interesting scenario, then kills it with heavy-handed (and pointless) description, inept character development, and just plain clunky writing. For example: Norah, one of the protagonists, meets a man called Howard. She wonders to herself, Where does he come from, and how did he get a name like Howard?Me: From his PARENTS. You blinking idiot.As I skimmed the 400+ pages of the book for the plot points, I mentally shook my fist at the author for her sappy story. For her female characters who are ""courageous"" and ""determined."" For that scene where one of the most stereotypical characters in the book whines that she doesn't want to be a cliche. And for naming a character with Down's Syndrome PHOEBE.Horrendous."
3,The Memory Keeper's Daughter,"I did enjoy this book in the beginning and at the end. The middle sort of jumped around and I was bored. But, finished it anyway. Not a bad read, just a little slow in the middle."
1,Not Great,Why didn't they just get divorced???? Great beginning and premises - but lost the momentum by mid-way through. Writing was only slight better than a Danielle Steel novel. Characters poorly developed and annoying. Disappointed because I had heard so many great this about this book. Didn't finish this book.
2,What happened ?,"When I first started reading Memory Keepers Daughter it really sucked me in and I was totally hooked. I thought this was the beginings of a great novel. But half way through the book it somehow lost the plot and I was left quite dissapointed. The second half of the book tried to go too deep and quite missed the point of looking at the parallel lives of the two children.It just seemed to drag on forever.. I feel qutie sad, the book was so good at the begining."
4,emotional scenario,"I agree with all the reviews, good and not so good! I found the book very emotional, interesting, memorable even with the improbable scenario. I kept wondering when and how the husband would reveal his secret and get it over with. I don't know how a child could be raised without the proper birth certificate etc; how a child could be buried when there was no body, and things like that. Regardless, I could not put the book down. It is a very good read."
2,"Well written, but . . .","I had high hopes for this book and was disappointed from the beginning. Although descriptive, it failed to evoke emotion. I found myself wanting to be finished with the book. I love books of all types, but I want them to entertain me. This one didn't."
4,The Memory Keepter's Daughter,I liked how this book describes how keeping a secret not only affects the person that is keeping the secret but those who are in contact with that person.
3,it's alright,"This was an interesting story that I'm sure bares alot of truth to it. I was very interested in what the characters would be like before I read this and it was a little less than what I had expected. I wanted more emotion than the blandness that I got. Nevertheless, you'll enjoy it."
3,Slow read,"I bought this expecting a really good book. It starts out really good and kept my interest, but the middle of the book was slow. By the time I got to the end I was losing interest. The story line was decent. All in all I thought it was an ok book."
2,surprised I didn't like,"I was surprised I didn't like this book.I heard such amazing reviews, but it seemed like it was full of fake emotion and hard to find any of the characters motives realistic.I also thought she spoke down to the reader and gave too much basic information out, especially in reference to time periods."
2,Sentimental drivel,The book started out well enough but fizzled by chapter three. What a disappointment!
2,"DEPRESSING, Disappointing","I really wanted to like this book, I had heard and read so many good things about it, I usually can't, not finish a book, but this one I am really struggling to finish. Without giving away the story, it starts with the faher giving away the twin born with downs syndrome, unbeknownst to the mother, and the effect this has on the entire family. Obviously this would have an awful affect on any family, the mother grieving a baby she thought died, and the father wondering if he did the right thing. Still, it is hard to have sympathy with this family, and having children myself, the whole thing just left me sad..I can't understand these people. I will finish it, but after I read something light."
2,Not my scene,A very depressing and highly unlikely scenario. Especially in this era. Could put it down very often and wondered why I battled to finish. No thank you.
3,Too Much of a Good Thing,"Reading this book was kind of like being back in high school--sometimes exhilarating and sometimes depressing. Either way, I couldn't wait for it to be done. It was like visiting a great friend a week too long. It was like keeping the roses out after they died. It was like the first snowfall of the year after the kids tramped through it. You get the idea.A difference between a memoir and an autobiography is how much of life the author captures--just the significant events or the entire lifetime. If this story had been true, it would have been an autobiography."
5,Excellent Book,"Kim Edwards' writing style is superb. She makes this book an extremely poignant read, while at the same time making us think about the lifelong implications of certain ""spur of the moment"" decisions. She has treated the behaviors of a kid with Down Syndrome with a lot of finesse. I could not put this book down once I picked it up."
2,Terrible audio CD of an okay book,"I listened to the Audio CD of this book, and it was horrible! I have a long commute in my car, so I listen to ALOT of Books on CD. The narrator on this particular one was very difficult to listen to, and did not have a pleasant voice at all.The story itself was okay - interesting, but not necessarily compelling, or a ""page-turner."" I had gotten it after reading some really good reviews, so maybe I was expecting more. But as mentioned by other reviewers, it felt like there was something missing."
3,Just OK..a little mushy,"I thought this book was just ""ok"", it was a little too sappy and mushy for me...the reviews called it a ""page turner"" etc..i guess..but honestly not all that compelling."
2,Not worth finishing,"Because this book had been on the best seller list for so long, I thought I'd try it. However, I found the characters to be flat, the writing rather boring and, after reading the first few chapters, just started skimming the rest before I gave up entirely."
2,No continuity in the plot,"Like a lot of people said, this book started off with a lot of promise. The premise to the story is very promising, but after the first couple of chapters, it goes downhill. The author does way too much editorializing and moralizing in the story. After David gives up his daughter, every single event, even if he burned his pancakes, is because of the ""decision he made all those years ago."" I don't buy it. There needs to be a clearer connection between the events in his life and the choice he made. Many of the characters have no relevance to the plot, and if anything, interfere with it. This seems like a story that is written stream of conscious with no connection from the previous event to the next, and then no editing is done to create a seamlessness in the storyline. There are so many seams in this plot, I thought I was inside of a shirt."
2,Plot Holes and Annoying Characters,"I do not understand the popularity of this book. Our book club has deemed this book 'Our Least Favorite'. We found many of the characters 'unlikeable'. Additionally, there were several plot holes."
1,started off great but pages were missing!,"I enjoyed the story line and was eager to find out how the characters would develop. Unfortunately, when i got to the middle of the book i realized there were over 50 pages missing!!! Unfortunately for me it had taken me a while to read this book and it was too late to return it. If you order this book be sure to make sure all of the pages are there."
2,Both good and bad,"This is one of those books where I had to see what all the hype was about. I liked how it started out. I loved the author's writing, it was very very descriptive. But man did this book drag. It was TOO wordy and TOO long. I really lost intrest in the characters and plot after ahile. I raced to the end and not in a good way."
3,Loved the first 3/4 of this book!,"(slight spoiler) The first 3/4 of this book is so amazing. If I had stopped reading then I would've given it a 5 star review. But I didn't stop there. I finished it, and I'm so frustrated at the reveal that I want to cry. I waited 370 pages to see how this was going to resolve itself, and it was so blase, not motivated at all...why now? what made Caroline go to Norah when she did instead of any other time? what motivated this?grrr...Anyway, I would still read it because her writing it beautiful and so emotionally gripping."
2,Way Too Much Description,"I liked the beginning of the book, but mid first chapter I was having serious thoughts on continuing. This book is soooooooo descriptive about every single thing that I don't know if I can keep going. It just seems like there is so much unnecessary detailing for every single thing and it makes the book drag. Second chapter and I notice that I'm already trying to skim paragraphs for information relevant to the storyline. After reading many of the reviews written here, I think I'm going to call it quits.Just updating here...I finished the book. Only read the first line in each paragraph and the dialogue between characters. I must admit that I did skip pages that were completely irrelevant to anything in particular. I felt drained after reading this. These characters were strange and I just didn't get the dynamics being so strained and damaged even given the storyline. Read it if you have nothing better to do but it will be a great task."
2,Soap Opera,"Its a shame that the good writing goes to waste and is trivialized by a weak, melodramatic, screamingly contrived, full of romantic nonsense, plot. This is harsh, but of what value to the author, unless as an exercise that might lead her to something greater, or to the reader that plunks down their money and plows through a novel that is not worth the time it takes to read it.After the corny truck driver bit; finding the nurse and the kid, I started skipping through it--it got worse and worse;the plot became more and more absurd and arbitrary."
3,Not all that I thought it would be,"I had heard so much hype about this book, that it may not have been able to live up to my expectations...I did think it was a decent book--well written, very interesting premise, flawed characters--but it just wasn't nearly as good as I hoped it would be. Half way through, I started skimming--it just seemed to drag and I just wanted to know how it would end. Overall, I was a bit disappointed because of all the great things I heard about it."
2,Improbable and Incorrect,"First, let's get one thing straight. The syndome described in the book is Down Syndrome (not Down's as so many people think). I can't understand how an author could get this wrong. Didn't she do any research? I have a step-son with Down Syndrome, and after knowing him for 27 years, I would say that the description of the child in the book's strengths is unrealistic. The book paints a much rosier picture than many parents and caretakers observe in real life.The premise that this father/doctor could do what he did is too far-fetched to be believable or probable. Therefore, the whole story is compromised."
4,Thought-provoking read,"Read this book as a book club selection. I found it be a very provoking read. The imagery used in the book is beautiful and truly adds to the understanding of the characters and the enjoyment. The book is a solid, gripping read and one that is hard to put down."
3,Drifting Memories,"My take on this novel is that the movie was better than the book. As previous reviewers have stated, there was a lot of information distracting the reader from the meat of the plot. The unnecessary lengthy discussions are eliminated from the movie, i.e. the whole Rosemary saga (which claims a good many pages) and David's yearning and interest in saving this young girl. The basic plot is excellent and the movie (unlike the book) relays the fundamentals of Ms. Edward's story, eliminating the surplus dialogue. My advice, watch the movie and pass on the book. Kim Edwards had a great plan but her delivery and editing left much to be desired."
3,"A good read, but not great","I enjoyed this book, and it's easy to read. I felt that the characters could have been more developed, but it was an interesting story."
1,Disappointing memories.,"Save your time and money. I read this book because it got such a high reviews. Unfortunately, I couldn't agree less with those reviewers. Maybe I'm not on the same intellectually level as some of the people that are raving about The Memory Keeper's Daughter. I didn't enjoy the story plot, characters, or the writing style. To tell you the truth it was such a trial to finish the book at all and I was excited that I reached the last page of the book not because I knew the ending but that I accomplished the feat of finishing a book that wasn't required reading."
1,Not for me,"Now, let me begin by being honest. I have not read this book from cover to cover... and have no intention of doing so. I read quite a bit and I can't remember the last time I have put a book down and really just gave up on it, until this one.I found it extremely boring, a lost and undeveloped plot. Is it me? Am I just a shallow person and was not able to really get it? If so, so be it. The book was still not good. I guess it did have quite big shoes to fill as I did pick this one up right after I read THE GLASS CASTLE. Now that is a book to read!"
2,"Dull, heavy going, too many adjectives","I didn't actually care what happened to any of the characters, too many adjectives, very predictable plot. If I read the word 'quicksilver' one more time to describe something...... maybe an ok book if you had to choose between this and another 2 star review in the airport news agent."
4,Sticky Web,"This book is an interesting insight into the world of he 60s when men often made decisions that ""protected"" their wives and families from the ""hardship"" of real life. The web of lies affects everyone involved for their lifetimes. As the parent of a child with Down Syndrome (It bothered me that this diagnosis was misspelled throughout the book) who is being raised in more enlightened times, I appreciated the story of Carolyn. Her character, in question because of her part in the deception, was rebuilt through her life-long campaign on behalf of her ""daughter."" The writing was terrific and impelling. The story was engrossing."
2,I guess my expectations were too high,"A huge fan of literary fiction, I was so excited about reading this book. Perhaps that explains why I was so disappointed - I expected too much. I thought it was much too wordy with incredibly LONG, dull passages of explanation, thoughts and flashbacks. The book also does not flow very well and I found myself getting lost in some places and had to often go back and re-read passages (re-read those LONG, dull passages). Some of Edwards' characterization almost seemed amateurish and there were also many holes in the story. David's family of Paul and Norah were depressing, spoiled and winey and I didn't connect to any of them. If the entire story had revolved around Caroline and Pheobe, it would have been much more enjoyable and interesting. I had to force myself to finish it and get to that incredibly dull ending. My advice: don't waste your time on this one. It may be a while before I take a chance on a Kim Edwards book again."
3,Just okay,"Just okay. I was sucked right in at the beginning, but it got a little tiresome. The ending was not quite satisfying. I would have liked to have seen David tell his wife and allow them to have the discussion of why he did what he did. I expected more shocking twists in the story. It was all a little predictable. A few parts seemed a little unrealistic... like David befriending the young pregnant girl and taking her in, and the brother moving to PA to be near his sister. I just find it a little difficult to believe either of these characters would have really done these things."
1,Double Yuk.,"Not only is this book depressing, it so overwritten that you feel as if you have to weed through all the extraneous descriptions of EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD before you can actually get to the meager storyline. No thought goes unexpressed, no floorboard uncreaked. Really, it was a dark and stormy night, folks. What a great premise, ruined by poor execution."
4,Makes anyone think about life,"I really enjoyed this book. I have passed it to others who also feel the same. I have read this book over a year ago now and I still remember the characters and their dilemmas. It is rare that I will read a book more than once, this book is one that I could easily pick up again. If you want a book that is easy to read, but offers more than a simple story, this could be what you are looking for."
3,Something Missing,"I read it, but it took a while. It was not a page turner. There were sections that almost made it a page turner, but then failed miserably at doing so. I finished it b/c I wanted to see the outcome. Disappointed in the ending. Nothing happened. It just didn't ""clean"" everything up very well. Lots of loose ends and unfinished scenarios. It was just a sad book. Not much of it made me feel good, but maybe that was the author's intention. I have a hard time finishing books that don't interest me and I DID finish this one so I guess that says something about it. I checked my copy out at the library. If you are going to read it, then I suggest doing the same."
2,"Easy read, little substance","I picked this book up because of the cover. I know, don't judge a book by its cover. However, the quotes on the jacket were quite compelling. To my disappointment, this is no extraordinary book. Just a simple story about two families bound by a disgraceful secert. I expected there would be more emotion, more deepth of character and more interesting scenes. Instead, I found the author stretching to be poetic and using wore out scenerios- like having a character drive dangerously fast to the river, out of anguish. The worst part of this book for me was the introduction a new character towards the end of the book. This interduction was disjointed and too outlandish to be true to these lives. Also, it set up the end of the book for the same type of scenes. The Memory Keeper's Daughter has a beautiful title, and is an easy read, but if your looking for a rewarding, quality read: pass this one by."
2,Overrated,"This book falls in the category of a ""good beach read."" The storyline drags mercilessly once one has read through the initial very engrossing pages. The writing style becomes increasingly tiresome. Towards the end, I was skipping whole paragraphs and didn't feel as if I'd missed a thing. The characters are thoroughly unlikeable. When I finished this book, I read a book by Marily Robinson, ""Housekeeping"", and was struck by the contrast between a great writer and a fair writer. Don't waste your time, unless you're on the beach with time to waste!"
2,Disappointing,This book started off exciting but quickly crashed and burned. It was extremely hard to get through and I had to force myself to finish the book. There was entirely too much scenery description and little sustenance to the plot.It would be an interesting subject for a book club discussion as there are several controversial topics but overall not a book I would recommend.
2,fascinating premise that bogs down in too much detail & not enough dialogue,"Probably spoiled having just finished ""Atonement"" by Ian McEwen and ""The Poisonwood Bible"" by Barbara Kingsolver before dipping into ""The Memory Keeper's Daughter"" (a great title that promises more than this book delivers), I found the characters annoying, the extraneous plot lines too much of a stretch, and the endless details tedious. This book was both over- and under-written. Over written with ""soap opera characters"" and repetitious similes (if she compared an infants' hands to a star or a starfish one more time I was going to put the book down for good.) Under-written as the characters could have been made so much more real given more dialogue. The best characters were Al & Doro, who came alive through their brief bits of dialogue, and for whom no lengthy background was necessary.A fascinating story and a well-intentioned effort, but a disappointment."
2,Seemed like it would never end,"The beginning of the book really grabbed me, but by the middle of the book, it seemed like it would never end. It felt like a nightmare from which I felt I would never wake."
4,A solid 4 stars,"I would give this book a firm four stars. It is an intriguing subject matter, the characters are well formed and have depth, and it evokes a range of emotions. However, Edwards makes the all too common mistake of repeating herself. Anytime a difficult situation arises, she brings up the exact same issues, sometimes using nearly the same wording as during the last difficult situation. Yes, a lifelong problem would rise in one's mind repeatedly but, for the reader (listener for the CD), never delving deeper or doing something about it becomes tedious. Apart from these sections of the book, it is an enjoyable and relatable story."
2,I only finished it because its the only reading matieral I brought on the plane :(,"It started out well enough but I have to agree with the other reviews, the book was too focused on making the Father the bad guy while the women play ""victim"".Two stars because it had potential and was hard to put down during the initial chapters."
2,"A page-turner, but too sad","I could not put this book down! Yet, for all of that, once I finished it, I felt cheated and DEEPLY saddened. The only happy part of the book is Phoebe. Everything else is just...sad. And there are a couple of plot twists that I can't stomach, either because they take away from the story or because they make no sense. I can't say anything more without spoilers, so I won't; but I did not like this book very much and I do not recommend it."
3,Ok but slow paced at times.,Story was interesting but the author spent too much time describing situations and repeating what the reader already knew. Slowed the pace of the book down quite a bit.
2,Not quite there.,"Interesting plot setup with a lot of promise... but instead, it unfolded into a Lifetime movie. Or soap opera. I've read better."
4,Great listen .,I really enjoyed this novel. Read it as an audible and looked for ways I could find a time to continue to listen .
1,Lacking in chewable substance,"This book, so loaded with promise by it's title, nature and theme, feels more like a book full of one dimentional characters. No one character is fleshed out enough to be believable. I would not recommend this book. It truly is a disappointment. If you must read it, buy it used or better yet the library has it."
2,I shouldn't have bothered reading this book,"I think the author has potential. I found myself getting interested for a short time and then positively bored.I think one of my problems with this book is Norah's daily obsession with a daughter that she thought died at birth. It seems like you would obviously mourn the loss but then be grateful for the twin son that lived. I can't imagine that she would ache and pine daily for this girl to the point that she doesn't really enjoy her beautiful healthy son. It just seems ridiculous that 5, 10 , 15, 20 years later you constantly think and grieve for a child you never knew."
2,sentimental and predictable,"This book reminds of those stories that used to be in ladie's magazines when I was a teenager. lots of emotion, unbelievable circumstances with a few plucky women mustering through in spite of adversity."
3,"Birth, death, secrets, and lies","The Memory Keeper's Daughter is the story of twins born in 1964, a healthy baby boy and a girl with Down Syndrome, to a naive young woman and her husband, a doctor with a difficult past. Told from the point of view of four of the main characters, this book gives a look into the lives of each individual and how one person's decision can change the lives of so many others. I liked this book a lot, though there were times when I got frustrated with it. I didn't always like the actions of the characters, I came to understand them. Definitely worth the read, but skip the Lifetime TV movie -- it diverges from the book too much."
1,Don't believe the hype,"This book started out with such promise. The under-developed characters just did nothing for me. I really really wanted to like this book, but the author wouldn't let me. It was boring and hard to finish. There are just too many cliches and no dialogue! It felt like an after-school special. This book is selling by word-of-mouth. Don't believe the hype. I agree with other reviewers who suggest Kingsolver's ""The Poisonwood Bible"" or Walls' ""The Glass Castle"". Those are books that are not a waste of your time."
2,Got tired of the characters,"I really liked the premise for this book, and thought it had great potential. About halfway through I was either impatient with or bored of several of the major characters. It was an OK story, but I would have liked to see more three-dimensional characters."
1,What a waste of time.....,"Had I known this book would turn end the way it did, I would have saved myself the time and effort. The synopsis sounded great, and I heard from a reliable source that it was a good book. It took me weeks to read it, because I just couldn't get into it. I kept putting it down, and reading other books in the meantime.I was not able to identify or grow to like/love any of the characters. The plot was good, but to drag it on for 25 years....????? Come on! And the part where David ""rescued"" Rosemary? I was about to just call it quits and put the book down. I was very disappointed to find out that David died before he could even admit his guilt. This book could have easily been 150 pages long, and then maybe I wouldn't have been so upset about taking the time to read it. I will not be recommending this book to ANYONE!"
2,contrived,The real question is: so many people recommended this book -- did I miss something? The plot is contrived; the characters are made from cardboard; and it reads like a 2nd rate romance novel.New characters and plot elements are introduced with the finesse of a child forcing puzzle pieces together that don't quite fit; the author used a hammer to knock them in place.Your time is valuable; skip this book.
2,WAAAAAAAAAY too long,"The biggest problem with book is that it was too long. I felt like it would never end. The story is not interesting enough to be novel sized. There is nothing to keep the reader interested. There really wasn't that much of the story. I feel bad and everything for the character, but I kept asking myself, why am I reading this? I kept thinking something interesting might be coming. But it never did."
1,SOOO long,"I'm only like 200 pages in, which means I have like 300 more to go. WHY? This book is KILLING me. I noticed very early on that the characters are too self aware. As other commenters mentioned, the descriptions of water and light and fans and beauty are very unrealistic, too romantic to be believable. Also, every time Phoebe is mentioned, the only descriptive term is ""beautiful."" In an effort to be politically correct, she fails to be realistic. These are her exercises in mushy writing. The images she creates are beautiful in a broken way, but it's just not how people going about their daily lives think or process their realities. Like Annie Dillard, but with no substance. Every character is a stock character from a soap opera. And the husband, David, is too heavily portrayed as an antagonist. Yes, he screwed up, but his character should be given a little more sympathy. Please don't pay money for this if you have to read it."
1,Angry,"I was actually angry with Kim Edwards as I read this book. The book was full of coincidences, inconsistencies, unncessary description, undevelped characters, and unrealistic events. It felt like Edwards had an idea for a plot and bulldozed her way through the writing to make it happen. I have never been so irritated and furious at an author while reading a book. I can't understand how this book made it through an editor. The only reason I finished the book was because I was reading it for a bookclub. Amazon needs a 0 star rating!"
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"I read a volume of short stories by Kim Edwards, ""The Secrets of a Fire King"", and was impressed with the dreamy, fluid quality of her prose. Most of the stories were set in exotic locations and/or involved a variety of offbeat characters. I highly anticipated reading ""The Memory Keeper's Daughter"" and was sorely disappointed, almost to the point of disgust. The prose was awkward, the story boring and I could not sympathize with any of the depthless, flatly drawn characters. After the brilliance of Ms. Edward's short stories, this was a huge letdown and if I could have given it zero stars I would have. Perhaps short stories are her forte; I cannot recommend ""The Secrets of a Fire King"" enough, and I cannot recommend ""The Memory Keeper's Daughter"" at all. Why it has received such glowing reviews and wide readership is a mystery to me."
1,Predictable: nothing new,"I was expecting a good read, as this book received a lot of hype and it was recommended highly by other readers and book clubs. However, I found this book to be quite predictable and overly done, and I lost interest two-thirds of the way through. I found myself not caring how everything turned out in the end, and grew weary of the main characters. The author seemed to be trying a bit too hard to make it a dramatic and gripping story by picking a controversial ""separated at birth"" story, but for the most part the plot seemed quite implausible and a little too much, which made it hard to invest any real interest in afterwhile. Overall, a disappointing and predictable read."
3,Good but a little long,"I liked the idea of this book, but the middle of the book was really long with not much action. Maybe a good book to read if you're short on ideas, but it's not going to keep you on the edge of your seat."
1,A real stinker!,"Sorry to be so negative, but I found this book to be so idiotic and stupid I could hardly stand it. How many times do I have to read that someone's hand resembles a starfish? Driving over a hill at night, the character almost loses control of the car because the sight of the city is so beautiful. What city is it? Pittsburgh. A woman who is engaged to a brilliant scientist loses him to an accident when he jumps off a bridge as a stunt. Huh? Come on! There are so many examples of inanity that I can't count them all. If you'd like a full dose of sclock, buy this book!"
2,Great plot but dull,"The storyline makes for a great plot but still fell flat. The beginning started out great and then the story just went on and on without any significant turn of events until the very end. I like descriptive authors, but paragraph after paragraph of describing the snow, the darkroom and picture taking..uggh! I ended up scimming the pages to see how the story ended, which in my opinion was predictable. Even with all the descriptive writing, I still didn't ""get"" the characters."
1,Poorly written,"I will keep this short and simple by saying read the review RMurray847 posted. It is spot on and my sentiments exactly. Every character in this book feels shallow, self-centered and uncaring about anyone but themselves, with the exception of Pheobe, the character with Down's syndrome. It started out as a good, original idea and went south from there. Unlike RMurray847, I only give it a one star because I always finish a book I start, and this one irritated me to the very end."
4,Great Book Club Selection,"We read this book in my Book club, and it gave us lots to talk about. It is a memorable and moving story. We enjoyed discussing the motivations and choices made by David Henry, and the unforeseen consequences of his actions. I would recommend this to any book club."
3,Sad story,"I enjoyed the book, but was disappointed when she had all those affairs. It finally did end the way it should."
3,UNSATISFYING MEMORIES,"I am not a quitter, but I just could not finish this book. I tried! The narrative appeared to skip all over the place and I couldn't keep track. The characters were semi-interesting, but not interesting enough to care about them or feel compassion. I desperately want to be concerned deeply about the characters I read about----even if they are blatent jerks, but I became complacent.Norah was boring and difficult to feel empathy for, but I did appreciate her sister, Brie. She added a bit of spice, which the book lacked. Norah was a non-dimensional, substance less woman, and I wanted her bones to have matter, meat, spirtit, and essence.Although the premise appealed to me, I skimmed and waited too long for a revelation, which did not arrive. So in the end, I needed to exit before I completed ""The Memory Keepers Daughter."" The dissatisfaction of the book left me without memory or longing to find out what happened next."
3,I expected better...,I'd seen this book at the top of the best sellers list for weeks but never had much interest in reading it until a co-worker told me how much she enjoyed it so when I recieved 'THE MEMORY KEEPERS DAUGTER' as a gift I cracked it open immediately. The book had me hooked from the first chapter and I knew that I was going to just fly through it but as the book went on I noticed that it began to drag toward the middle and ended at a snails pace. The premise of the story was a promising one and there were parts of the story that did keep you on the edge of your seat in anticipation of how things would turn out but overall not much happend in this book.'THE MEMORY KEEPERS DAUGHTER' is a book filled with great promise that never fully lives up to it's potential or it's hype. 3 1/2 stars.
3,Quantity over Quality,There might be the greatest tennis quips of all time in this book but there is also a lot of uninspired and unimaginative quotes in this book as well. Half the size and dumping some of the dull quotes would have improved the book.
4,For Lovers of Charles Kuralt and Montana,"When Charles Kuralt died in July 1997, I cried. At the end of 1997, when the annual obituaries were listed, I cried again. Okay, I really liked Charles Kuralt.I'm an avid flyfisher and I am spending the whole summer in Twin Bridges, Montana, not far from Charles and Pat's ranch, the Bluebird Wildlife Sanctuary.Needless to say, I was fascinated by this book. I do have some hesitation in recommending it wholeheartedly, however, to anyone not a Kuralt or Montana fan. Some of the details are rather sketchy, especially where the late 80s and early 90s are concerned. The story started out strong, kind of faded out and then came back strong after Charles died.All in all, I'm glad Pat Shannon wrote this book. Pick it up. I think you'll like it."
1,NOT WORTH IT,"I am extremely disapointed by this product. It is made for a bathroom with high ceilings, which I do not have. It is also not easily adjustable. I ended up having to modify the pipes to make them shorter, which made the hoop much less stable. I had to use electrical tape, and rig up an extra hook to make it stable. Not to mention, you are required to modify the pipes using a hack saw. If you do not own a hack saw...This product is also only intended for showers with an existing virticle shower head pipe, which the hoop attaches to. If you do not have one, this is not the product for you.And finally... it's TINY. There is no room inside fo the shower curtains to actually SHOWER. When I stand in the shower, both sides of the shower curtains rub against my skin.Overall, I would recommend splurging on a nicer, larger, easy to assemble hoop."
2,two thumbs down,two thumbs down for this product not expressing the need for the third support of the shower head pole.This project was a disaster for my bathroom and a waste of money.DO NOT BUY unless you have a third support where the shower head is supposed to go/hang.
2,Shower rod functional but difficult,The shower rod is functional once you figure out how to put it together. It takes two people to do it and be prepared to hold your arms over your head for awhile. There are a lot of pieces to put together and once the rod is hung since it anchors to the shower and the ceiling makes sure you don't put a real heavy shower curtain on it or pull too hard in the wrong place - it wouldn't be pretty
2,You better own a Hack Saw,"Flimsy and difficult to install. You need a Hacksaw and forget about installing this yourself, must have someone to hold it while you are installing so the pipes dont bend. This should have been in the 20 range for the quality."
2,Not Worth The Effort,This product is not worth the time it takes to install. Very difficult to do alone and when installed it is so light that it will not hold up two shower curtains that you need to use this rod.
1,Useless,"Worthless for med school admission. Here I'll give you all the info in the book: get good grades, do well on mcat, write a good essay. Most of the book is essays from successful applicants. Wouldn't recommend copying one for yourself so I can't see the reason for them being in there."
2,not too bad,"this album is definately something new for hip hop thats for sure, but i personally dont like his style too much because he OVER-exaggerates the whole jesus theme in every single song on this album and so it is really only for strong christians rather than hip hop fans.i prefer the old bizzy bone albums.his album before this, Thugz Revenge is however a 5-star album where he goes back to his old heavens movie-type flow and is definatley one for fans to check out"
2,Gotta be honest,"I've been a Bone fan for 12 years and Bizzy's first 3 solos are classics in my opinion. However, all of the fears that Speaking In Tongues brought to my mind were confirmed by this release. I still think that Bizzy's a uniquely talented and spiritual man, but he seems to have surrounded himself with wack producers and low expectations. The repetative hooks and sparse verses are particularly disappointing."
2,Rehash of the Nov-Dec 2001 News,"I bought this book hoping to gain some additional information about what happened during the prolonged dispute over the election. Other than a couple of interesting anecdotes from two people who believe their votes were stolen by the early announcement for Gore, and Gore's pursuit of throwing out military ballots, there is nothing new here. If you paid attention to the news during the entire sorry episode, you pretty much know what's inside Sammon's book--and more. That was disappointing to me."
4,Valuable tool for employees,"As a human resources director, I am constantly searching for inventive ways to add value to the relationships I maintain with personnel. I began to lend out this guide to personal finances to people with a lot of questions about our 401K, etc., and got very positive responses from just about everybody. I recommend this for anyone in my position, and hope you find it as useful as I do."
3,Nicely presented intoduction to several green techniques,"A very nicely presented 'survey' of several green building techniques with a practical and mainstream perspective. Less inspiring and holistic (in terms of presenting an overall philosophy of building AND living) than the likes of The Hand-Sculpted House (Evans, Smiley and Smith), etc. but the beautiful photography and clear writing is a powerful tool to use in convincing the skeptical that green building is a legitimate and aesthetically pleasing option in construction. Really more of a 'complete introduction' than a 'complete how-to guide' in my estimation- if you are really going to build you'll need to suppliment your knowledge with additional in depth books on the particular system(s) you choose to use, but this book will expose you to some of the options and provide you with an informational foundation to 'build' on (pun intended)."
1,Poor Remake of the Original,"This game does not even attempt to bring back the atmosphere of the original Monopoly game. It has several design flaws; the computer plays out of turn, the animations are not synchronized, and, worst of all, the ""voices"" in the game quickly become annoying.Another quirk is that the game fails to offer any method of changing the level of difficulty (e.g., there is no difference in ""easy"" or ""hard"").Also, please note that this game was not written by the true Atari company; instead, Infogrames have changed their name in order to establish a different reputation... I think, however, that they are ruining Atari's reputation!"
1,Awful Remake of The Original Monopoly,"This game has several design flaws. For one, the computer constantly plays out of turn. This can be annoying when trying to make buying decisions. Secondly, the ""voices"" in the game quickly become old. You have the option of turning both this and the music off, which you may as well do, because both are of low quality. The music is that of redundant piano music; in other words, annoying. Additionally, the difficulty options that allow for easy to hard playing do not differ; I found no difference in difficulty when I chose easy or hard.Also, please be aware that this game was not written by the true ""Atari"". Infogrames have changed their name to Atari to sound better, but it is still the same old French company that make bad games like this."
3,Montana,"This is the first time I have seen this movie and Flynn does his magic performance again. I would recommend "" MONTANA "" to anyone who love to see Errol Flynn."
3,Good work for any man,Good book to use with young men who want help. Would also be helpful for parents and mentors who are trying to understand the addition of pornography in men.
4,Ce livre - c'est magnifique!,"This book is fabulous for any French IV student. It is completely en francais, finally ending the use of unnecessary English explanations. The best part is that new vocabulary words are defined with words one should already be familiar with. Immersion, immersion, immersion! Also, there are great sections on francophone culture. C'est fabuleux!"
3,A fun read,"It is good to know that there are quite a few books in this series. Lady, Lady, I Did It was my first foray. I intend to read another one soon."
4,"Fun, but Film and Flash Issues","This is definitely fun, but I also had a hard time finding the film for my daughter. When I did finally find the correct film (I, too, bought 200 by accident), the flash stopped working! We wasted five exposures of the hard-to-find and not-inexpensive film trying to troubleshoot. I was told by the electronics department that Polaroid no longer exists as a company and that they won't be making anything new but that another company was continuing to make film, for now. I'd suggest that if you see the film, BUY IT! The photo booth takes regular, sticky, and fortune i-zone film. I've seen the sticky and fortune film here on Amazon--a 3 pack for $18.99. Good luck! I'll be calling the company tomorrow about the flash. :-("
3,Broke when opened,"My neice opened this box on xmas and dropped it on the floor. Bad, I know, but it didn't work after that. Probably her fault but for a kids toy it should have lasted longer!"
3,Where's the film??!!,"My 12 year old received the ""My Photo Booth"" for Christmas, and absolutely LOVED it. However, it has been impossible to find replacement film in the Washington D.C. and Baltimore suburbs. And Polaroid does NOT even sell the film online that will fit this camera toy. How can this product continue to be marketed if there is no film available to use after the initial 6 shots are depleted? If there was easy access to replacement film, I would definitely rate this at 5 stars. Unfortunately, that is NOT the case."
4,Champagne and Milano cookies,"Nothing compares to sitting down to a good flick with a bottle of cheap (but good) champagne and some Milano cookies. Especially when you know ahead of time that the movie you've rented is going to be good. ""Cinematherapy..."" breaks down some of the best ""chick flicks"" out there into amusing categories, that really do fit whatever mood you might be in. Although this book is not a scholarly read, anyone that can appreciate what it feels like to relate to a movie in such a way that it moves you to laugh and/or cry can understand how great this book really is. If you are looking for an educated and serious look into movies, don't buy this book. But, if your mom is crazy and you're looking for a movie that portrays your situation, ""Cinematherapy..."" is just what you need."
2,So-So,"I was so excited to get this book. As a movie lover, I was hoping to find some really good chick-flicks within these pages. However, this book was not what I thought or hoped it to be. Most of the movies were fairly common and not all of them were the classic ""chick flick"". Actually, there were a lot of movies that were wonderful that were not even included in this list."
3,Outdated,"Mostly easy to understand info even for a beginner, but be aware that most of the information is academic as it is 10+ years old. These mods are not possible on digital microprosser driven equipment. The section on antennae is very good and accurate."
2,Cutesie and true crime don't mix!,"This book was like reading a long newspaper article on the murder. The facts are given, and given in the correct chronological order. There are numerous typos, but I suppose this is to be expected with a quickie book. I didn't appreciate the cutesie chapter titles. They aren't appropriate for this sad story. I can't believe that with all of the schmoozing I saw Karem doing with the Fahey family, as well as the Capano family at the court house, that by naming the chapters so, he could be so insensitive to the murder of the Fahey's sister and the pain the Capano girls must be feeling about their father's actions. Easy reading, no thinking involved. For some, that's enough."
5,Sword-and-sandal standout,"Great spectacle, lots of action, fun episodic plot. The ""giants"" are really a bunch of neanderthals, but the valley with the giant lizards still makes for a fun climax. It's one of the best of all the myth-inspired pepla."
5,Wow!,"I've bought a few of the other Eno Remasters and while they're better than the original CDs they might not be worth the price unless you're a completist or an audiophile. This CD is an exception. I've always disliked the original CD version with its distortion and sound as if heard through cotton batts. This remaster is lightyears away from the original CD. It is crisp and clear and spacious. I hear things I've never heard before. It is amazing. If you like the original--run, don't walk to get this."
5,"If your home is on wheels, you need this book!","Whether you're an expert or novice, whether you're on the road every day or just for the occassional getaway, ""Spirit of the Open Road"" is a must. Filled with tips on everything from purchasing your RV or trailer to holding tank maintenance, Peggi's book is filled with useful in-depth information. Written as if by a good friend, you won't be able to put the book down. What's more, you'll turn to ""Spirit of the Open Road"" time and time again for advice and money saving ideas. Buy two copies, your first is sure to become dog-eared!"
4,Very cute!,"Love them, only complaint is that one turtle's seam has already come apart. Easy fix though with a needle and thread."
5,celtic punk!!!! that says it all,"they ...rock!!, so unique and talented, i'm amazed, but they are very different and any lover of punk will love these guys.Jt"
5,hello sir walter,"ballydowse is so beautiful and positive, the Lord really worked through them. they were a total hit."
1,Celtic wrong CD Picture of different CD to that supplied,Hey Folks. The picture shown and artists listed is different to the celtic heartbeat CD that is sent when you order. You get the Celtic Heartbeat Collection Vol 1. What happened to the one shown????? Celtic Southern Man. (Very Disappointed)
2,One of the silliest time travel romance books I've read!,"Nothing exciting about this time travel romance. Nothing thrilling... except some hot sex between the hero, Seth and the heroine, Laurel/Hope (depending on which century you're talking about). Anyway, the whole story is sooooo predictable and quite silly... By the time I reached 3/4 of the book, I almost fell asleep from boredom! I mean, I could guess what was going to happen NEXT! Yawn.. I think ""Wild Summer Rose"" is one of Amy's best works by far! I would certainly recommend ""Wild Summer Rose"" anytime!"
5,The Most Comprehensive Book Out There!!,"This book is the best resource for everything-Brooklyn! This book puts Zagats to shame. It is the perfect guide to key Brooklyn neighborhoods, and you should not leave home without it! In fact, I keep a copy in my car, just in case... If I could give a book a 6 star rating, this book would get it!"
3,GET DOWN TO EARTH,These books are very nice but I am tired of seeing the same pictures over and over. Specially pictures of rich people houses and resorts that most Mexicans can't afford. I am sure there are modest mexican homes that have nice gardens and it would be refreshing to see real Mexican gardens instead of expats gardens that do not really reflect Mexico.
5,Textbook,Exactly what was expected. Came timely and was a better price than the college book store. Appreciated how quickly it came
4,So much easier,"My old masher was the plastic kind with lines that go back and forth, that you have to stop and clean out every ten seconds. Never again! We are a small household, so I usually only mash 2-3 potatoes at once, but with this masher, they are mashed in 1-2 minutes or less (seriously never more than 2 min.!), with no stopping to clean it out. You just keep mashing and before you know it, you've got mashed potatoes. The only drawback is this masher is above-average in price, so I gave it 4/5 stars, but I would have given it 4.5/5 or 90% if I could have. If you don't mind paying almost twenty bucks for a potato masher, get this one. It really works great."
5,Worth The Price!,"I purchased the WMF Profi Plus Stainless Steel Potato Masher as an appreciation gift for my coworker. She has used this in the past and was very pleased. Though I never used the product personally, removing it from packaging I could see how well made masher was and durable. Happy with design and materials. Arrival was swift and packaging was appopriate. Thanks You!"
5,Excellent potato masher,"I subscribe to cooks illustrated online magazine. In there equipment reviews this WMF potato masher was choosen as ""the best"" out of many. I received the masher on the same day I needed to mash up some butternut squash - it worked great - got in all of the corners of the pot and did not spend unnecessary time breaking up the squash. Incidentally, there is another german made tool with similar design and rating with a price tag at twice the price."
1,Poor content,Very disappointed relatively to what you can found on the Internet for free. I was expeting a lot concerning this book that was recommanded to me but the level is very low and subjects are given with real business cases.
4,Lounge Lizard,"I first read the reviews on Amazon, and decided to buy one. Have had it about 2 months. So far, I am pleased. Very comfortable. Seems reasonably well made, though is NOT made of stainless steel, as one reviewer indicated.Three reasons I rated only 4 stars. First, The unit does not open or close easily. It sometimes requires 3 hands. Second, moving the chair did not seem to have been considered. Is awkward, even with two hands. Third, the seat lock on the right hand side would not work at all. I had to disassemble the lock and remove one of the special shims. This should have been caught by their quality department."
3,Somewhat useful,"The book had some useful suggestions, and the author provided many examples that he himself has used. But with these suggestions it seemed like the author was showing off and bragging more about how he persuaded people than focusing on the lessons of communication. Natuarally how we speak can and does have an influence on people. I see that as a separate topic. I wanted a book that could help me summarize my thoughts so I can communicate them more succinctly."
4,Worth the investment,Easy tape to listen to in a car. Good ideas on how to communicate with busy people. A little light in places
4,Excellent Information and Condition,"This book has business survival information from a communicating perspective and, although used, was in excellent condition. Would have liked delivery sooner than two weeks, but was not prepared to pay a premium for delivery."
4,Very Good,I really enjoyed the taste of these chips. They are different from any I have ever eaten. I would say they have a taste of there on and I would certainly purchase them again.
1,Not At All Satified,The Pizza cutter I received was not at all like the one pictured or described. They sent a much cheaper model. The cutter was suppose to have a 3 3/4 wheel this cutter has just a 2 1/2 wheel. Would not recommend at all. I would give this 0 Stars. [...]WMF Profi Plus Stainless Steel Mega Wheel Pizza CutterRick in Middlebourne WV
4,A help... Wow do I recognize this kid...,"This book is written by a parent who has been there and done that. Advocating for our children is tough, but it is even tougher when so little is known about their needs by others. When others misunderstand why our children react the way that they do it is nice to be able to turn to some resources that educate and support us in our climb. My daughters principle for next year currently has my copy of this book. He admits that educators do not have a whole lot of knowledge base for dealing with these differently wired children. It was nice to have something to hand to him, and say here read this, then you'll have a better idea what we are facing in giving this sweet child what is needed.More awareness is needed."
2,Hate to say it but disappointing,"I am a big fan of Mobil Travel Guides and have beenlooking for a new Northeast Edition for the longest time.Now there's a separate New York Guide, which seems likeit should be more comprehensive but it's not. Somehowthough they're only focusing on one state, there's lessinformation. Bring back the Mobil Northeast Travel Guide,which is great if you want nearby vacation ideas and aren'tsure where you're going."
1,Save your money... and don't buy this.,"This holster broke immediately. The next unit broke in the same spot within hours of receiving it. I'd ask Amazon for a third unit, but what's the point, this is clearly a low-quality product."
5,Worthwhile reading if you're going into private practice,"This book was helpful for me when I was considering entering private practice as a hypnotherapist.It was inspiring to read other hypnotist's case studies, and I enjoyed reading about their different approaches to various problems their clients faced.I got some ideas from the case studies, and am glad I stumbled upon this book when I did because it helped me make the leap into my hypnosis private practice - the work I truly love.I recommend it."
1,Who Are These Guys ?,"I should start by saying that I'm a big fan of 60s instrumental music--Shadows, Tornados, Ventures, Spotnicks, Outlaws--great stuff !I had not heard of these guys--now I know why !If this is their ""best material"", I don't need to hear anything else ! The music is weak, amateurish and very forgettable. As soon as I heard their version of the Shadows' classic ""Apache"", I knew there was a problem--dull and lifeless. The ""bonus tracks"" are vocals, and are equally bad. You could have gone to any dance hall or club in the 60s, and heard better musicians than these guys.I do not enjoy writing negative reviews, but honesty comes first.Oh yes--check that price--OUCH ! Unless you are a fanatic instrumental ""completist"", well--you have been warned !"
2,Snapped with little pressure,"Bought it because it was cheap and HSS. Even with proper drilling technique (cutting oil, backing out every 1/4 turn, etc.) it only made it about have an inch into a very low grade bolt before it snapped into 4 pieces."
1,Worst text book ever written!,"It's hard to avoid a book that's mandatory for a class, but if you have other options I suggest you steer away from this one. I've never seen a more poorly written text book in both my undergrad and grad level courses! This book is a complete disaster. The questions/problems at the end of the chapter assigned for homework do not have supporting examples to learn from. It is a complete guessing game at how to arrive at the correct answer. I had to buy this book for my class but do not plan on using it afterwards. It is completely worthless!"
5,Well Written,"I greatly enjoyed this book, It kept my interest till the last page. The funny parts worked well with the plot"
4,A Good Book,This is one of Leo Waterman's better books. The story moves quickly and keeps you interested in a very strange cast of characters. The ending is a little convoluted but it's standard for this type of book. We're not tlaking great literature here. We read these books because we just want a good story. Not only is this a good story but it's fun as well.
4,Good Read,"Although some parts were a bit confusing, it was a good book overall. Definitely recommend it! I've purchased the next book in the series and plan to continue with the rest."
1,Didn't Finish It,"I didn't finish this disappointing book. Too much sleaze; not much plot; characters do not appeal. After reading approx. 20%, I set it aside for something better."
3,Moderately Amusing,"This was a moderately amusing first novel by G.M. Ford. It was entertaining and fast paced, but it felt a little too much like a ""made for TV"" movie. There are some funny scenes, but I thought a lot of it was just silly.You will get a pretty good sense of Seattle and suburbs, and Waterman is an interesting PI. But there isn't enough here to have me rush out and get the next in the series. There is too much better stuff out there. I recommend this only if you are an avid reader of the ""hard-boiled PI"" genre."
4,"decent book, decently well written","If you like this character set, then the book will work fine for you. It is well paced and somewhat humorous in points, believable to a point and absurd in its basic premise that the detective uses street people and drunks as his operatives. The politics are tricky with any book dealing with ecology and the author's navigation did not upset me like some other authors have- he keeps his political point of view fairly neutral- which for me was a relief."
3,Easy reading,"Not enough tension, took me forever to read. Found it long winded and quite boring. However, kudos to the writer."
4,Nice Dress,It is a very nice dress but make sure you have snaps on hand because my daughter wore it and the snaps broke so we had to sew new ones on. That was the only problem we had with the dress.
5,Great Stapler,The stapler is much better than the normal old staplers that I am accustomed to. The only potential problems are that it is made of plastic and it takes only a short refill of staples at a time.
2,Be careful when it gets jammed,This stapler works well in most conditions but be aware that I got injured trying to fix it! Always keeps your hand out of the place that the staples come out and always direct that part away from your face because I got a couple of staples in the palm of my hand and a friend told me that once the flying staples barely missed her face. Despite being a great product when works I am not planning to use it again.
4,Great Stapler but Staple pins are hard to fit,I love this stapler BUT it's a pain to find staple pins that fit. For some reason not ALL standard staple pins fit in this.
5,Useful Skimmer,"I added this skimmer ladle to my collection of WMF Profi Plus gadgets when we started to deep fry the potatoes in a pot. I did not like to make them in the deep fryer, but I listened to the advice to put the potatoes into the cold oil and to ""cook"" them. It works well for us. And with this skimmer it is easy to take the fries out of the oil. The skimmer is also very useful for soups to take out chicken or any other meat."
3,worked well for awhile,This was a gift last Christmas for my wife. It worked very well till one of the wires came loose from the base. I a buying another because of price and hope the new one is better
5,The Beatles as they were...,"The Beatles ""A Hard Day's Night"" (Red Cover) was the album (LP) which was released here in the USA and it was true to the film of the same name, I owned this album and played it constantly along with many of their other albums but when CD erupted on the scene I decided that it would be a good move to have this collection on CD along with CD sound (minus pops and hisses)only to find that most of the Beatles CD's were not the same music that was released here in the USA and so I set out on a quest to find CD's that were the same, Here they are both the original cuts and the later release versions and they come along with 7 bonus tracks, well worth their price.Scott"
3,Sound great ! don't last,"These sound the best when they're new . They just don't last very long. Sound gets muddy after exposure to air for about a month. If you're recording, put these on and hit record within a week and they'll sound fantastic !"
3,it was ok .,um Ive seen better movies um . bush is great other the other stuff . too much les stuff . would i buy it again um yea i think i would .
2,Not satisfied,"It was very boring and dull, im thinking that it was going to look in on like real prison in the newer years, it was like watching prison with ugly black and whites in the 1980s, if I known it was a prison in Alabama, i wouldn't have wasted my money omg"
4,"Very good, but not superior","Works very well, ergonomically, but after a few uses it showed a bit of melting at the leading edge--which is unusual b/c I did not let it sit in the pan. However, I still highly recommend it."
3,"For everyday whisking, get the metal version that WMF makes.","I have both and prefer the metal version of this that WMF makes for everyday whisking. Because the ""balls"" are made of plastic (or whatever they use), they just don't have the heavy weight to truly make aerating or general whisking as easy as it is with the metal version, which by the way, does a SPECTACULAR JOB! I haven't found too many uses for this nonstick version yet, but I still find it better than the traditional balloon styles."
3,Riser card for HP dc7700 SFF,"Riser card works fine. Fit was nice and snug. No ""slop"" but not requiring a hammer to get it installed. I gave it 3 stars even though it works fine, only because.... how excited can you get about a riser card?"
4,The little things,"I would give this movie five stars for myself, but objectively I recomend it at four. The other reviews do a good job of summing up. I just wanted to add that if your a fan of little touches and subtle humour, this is one of the greats. Hemmingway played more as the kind the drunken writer you might actually meet in real life, constantly giving out philosophy and observations in an un-solicited manner, obsessed with fair play (see the boxing match). Two American tourists in the cafe getting their literary facts wrong in the begining of the movie. An oil painting bobbing up and down as the background of a scene in a moving car... Hope I'm not giving away too much, but the little touches are part of why this is such a fun movie. If your into art, literature and the romantism of the twenties, but can still laugh at it and yourself, this is a great film."
5,"A big-band, brass sound with a great big beat.","This CD's got the rich brass, the bass and the beat all big band lovers hunger for. Hearing his arrangement of ""How High The Moon"" on a San Diego jazz station made me buy Ray Anthony's ""Jam Session At The Tower"" hoping for more of his great sound, and I was not disappointed. This CD contains more of Ray's great hits, and they bring back the sounds of the 30's and 40's, and they're all on a shiny 4 1/2"" piece of plastic. Send for it now...It's great!"
2,A trendy book,This is fashionable psychology = a bit repetitive and over stated . He could have said it all in a paragraph and we do not need endless descriptions of his boring family life.
3,shoe purchase,"The shoes are not very comfortable and are not the color I thought they would be. I live overseas, so returning them within the alotted time period is impossible."
5,Super Speakers,Great sound for outdoor speakers. Very natural sound with good base. Very well built.Great speakers for the money
5,Cheap and Fantastic,"This headset worked perfectly on my BB 8800. Same as another reviewer, I broke my Zen so I threw a media card into my BB and ordered these headphones. I've used them working out, in the car, and when just talking casually at home. They are also supercheap and arrived quickly after ordering."
2,Bad,The ear buds are so large that it is uncomfortable and does not sit comfortably. To add to that due to its large size the headset keeps falling down often.Actually I lost the interest of listening to music due to this headset.
3,EarPhone,I can hear other person very clearly but other person can not hear me so clear. My voice to the other part is very low.
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in Naturescapes because the music and videos were too fast for my liking... I thought it would be slow and more relaxing...some of the videos were beautiful, but went too quickly... just my take on it..."
3,"Good book, but hard to follow","I enjoyed Ian McShane in the BBC's televised versions of the Lovejoy novels. However, Johnathan Gash's character and plots are hard for me to follow. The characters' actions and motivations are just to foreign to me.Perhaps, if I live in Great Britain for a few years, I'd meet this type of character . . . at least enough to understand the motivations. But for now the Johnathan Gash novels are not my cup of tea!"
4,More Olodum!,Olodum is the most well-known of the Samba Reggae bands based in Salvador Bahia Brazil. Their style has an Afro swing combined with elements of reggae. On this cd Olodum combines various styles and various themes. If you liked their earlier cd's than you should like this one. Matter of fact this one will give you a better idea of how they sound in 2002 ...
2,Hot flashes?,"I was taking this product for 2-3 months and noticed an increase in hot flashes. I mentioned to my doctor that I was taking Niacinimide and he suggested the hot flashes could be from that, so I discontinued and hot flashes went away. Too bad, apparently Niacin is known to cause this side effect."
5,Von bondies rock!,First off I am thirteen but this says something about a credit card or something.But this album rocks! buy it right now if you don't you will be depressed every track is awesome!
4,Quality,"Smaller then I expected and the non stick is extremely hard. I'm afraid to use this on my new All Clad non stick skillets thinking it might scratch it's surface, but it does look nice as all WMF products do."
3,Good Advice In General,"This book contains a lot of good general advice for staying healthy throughout life. It is a bit vague in parts and too general for my taste. I found myself wanting more. It is very well rounded and includes advice on all aspects of life including spiritual, mental, physical, etc."
4,This Christmas CD is on point! Coming straight outta the dirty south!,This christmas cd is off the chain! This came out during my high school year! I like that whatcha gonna get for christmas remix. the original version was all good! I'm digging it! But the remix was tight! It's all that! I'm only bumping this on the holidays only like every year along with the rest of the christmas music that i be playing only during the christmas holiday! Thanks amazon! Good looking out!De'Vear SmallRepresenting Decatur GA
2,good Fiction,"Just like the old Chariots of Gods, his books are very interesting and and entertaining. But please dont think that you are reading a scientific work. Real historical works are not as sexy and entertaining as these books just as real archeologists are not Indiana Joneses."
4,Well.....,"This book was ok in the fact that it spent the entire book building on one real project. However, I thought the book was a tougher read than the Teach yourself Flash 5 in 24 hrs book. I guess it's really a matter of preference. I found this book to be adaquate, but not anything close to the other book. Teach yourself had a unique way of teaching you that really hammered the techniques home. I guess I didn't feel this one accomplished that."
5,Good Back Up.,"Well priced and does the job intended. Using Mac OS X (10.4 in my case) you can also avoid installing the included software. The Mac OS recognizes the UPS straight from the energy saver control panel (just plug in the USB cable). This was a nice added feature I wasn't expecting. You can automatically have it shut down in case of a power outage, etc."
1,Be careful the image is wrong!,The unit pictured is APC BE750G (newer model) while the unit that is described and that is shipped to you is APC BE750BB (older model). So yes the price is 20 bucks less but you don't get Master Control part and cooler looking unit.
5,APC BE750BB Back-UPS,Item shipped promptly and in perfect condition. Installed easily. A good choice for home computer and telephone systems
1,No good for computer equipment,"I bought a new one in April for my Xerox solid ink printer. So far as I can tell, it simple does not react quickly enough to changes in power to prevent the power outage or voltage spike/drop from getting to the printer. As a result, about half the time, the printer reacts the same as it would if it were plugged into the wall."
4,nat'l geographic tape,I bought lots of the national geographic tapes for a group that tries to teach children about kindness to animals. They loved them.
5,Great for those working in their computer's case,"I installed a Raid 0 array for my computer's programs, and used this 'fanout' cable for disk drive connections. It worked well to connect the drives to my RocketRaid controller board."
1,They changed it. Now it's awful!,"This used to be my number one beauty secret (the one in the gold can.) Now it is as hard and sticky as my great grandmother's setting spray -- designed to last a week without moving. If you get stuck in the rain, Lord help you. You have a 1980's hair gel mess.I suppose I could use a smaller amount as a simple shiny hair spray, after all the nice shine is still there. But that is not what my hair needs. The old spray was excellent as a dry curl enhancer/refresher. It worked well as a shine mist, and as a hair spray. It was great on second-day hair too. After my hair was dry I would turn it upside down, spray, scrunch, and bam! Ready for Saturday night in 2 minutes flat. I never needed another styling product. Now I need 3 or 4.FYI: I have Fine wavy (not curly) hair with damage from highlights.Please bring it back, John Frieda. I beg you!"
2,Where has James Patterson gone?,"I've loved James Patterson's books from the beginning, but I think he's spreading himself too thin and it clearly shows in this latest novel. It took me over a week to finish this book because it just didn't hold my attention. I usually can't put his books down and finish them in a day or two. It felt very rushed and without much thought. I hope his next book is better. Seems like he's writing for quantity, not quality."
1,One Star is Too Much,"This is drivel, plain and simple. While I long for the killer to kill Nana Mama and every other personal friend of Alex Cross I might be happier if the killer would just make me see that Patterson can no longer write a compelling novel. He used to be good but he simply sucks at this point."
5,Alex is back!,"Having read all of the Alex Cross books, I was anxious to get my hands on Mary, Mary. Mr. Patterson did not disappoint. The mystery was good with lots of twists to the plot. But I have the say the turn of events in Alex's life was what my focus was on. Hmm.... can't help but wonder what will happen next to Alex and the Cross family. I'm glad Sampson was back into the picture. I miss reading about their friendship. Hopefully we'll see more of him in future books."
4,4 1/2 stars,"In his usual brief and no nonsense writing style, James Patterson's latest Alex Cross novel--and I also think his best--will keep you guessing, as well as throw you a few surprises. Good entertainment.Highly recommended."
2,"Interesting story, but very poorly written","The story was intriguing enough that I finished the book in one day. However, the book was very poorly written. It reads like an 11th grade high school student wrote it for a creative writing assignment. This author had a great idea for a story, but executed it very poorly."
3,"Well-known characters, recognizable plot, familar outcome","FBI Special Agent Alex Cross has taken a rare vacation with Nana and his three kids. Even his current love Jamilla Hughes comes to visit him. However, a serial killer named Mary Smith has murdered several big Hollywood luminaries and the FBI tracks Alex down at Disneyland to recruit his assistance. Despite some choppiness in the narrative, the action is exciting as the LAPD and the FBI try to converge on the deranged suspect. His ex-partner and best friend John Sampson is clumsily added into this storyline. His ex-flame Christine torments him with no rational explanation regarding her attempts to claim full custody of their son. Alex's life is in jeopardy once again when he discovers the mastermind behind Mary. Alex Cross could never be a part of a dreadful novel; but this one left me unsatisfied."
2,Still Not Back in Form,"James Patterson's books are not what they once were. I have to agree with many of the earlier reviews that said the characters were not fully developed in this novel, & some bits were just thrown in for no reason. Why did Jamilla leave? Why did Christine come back? Motivations for various actions were sorely lacking. Although the concept was somewhat unique, it felt like a barely filled-in, still undeveloped plot outline. Not nearly the spell-binding Alex Cross mysteries I remember from Patterson's earlier days. Perhaps, when Hollywood gets a hold of it, a better writer will flesh out the story."
3,"Not Close to His Best, But Decent!","Anyone who thinks (or writes) that ""Mary, Mary"" is as good as ""Kiss the Girls"" or ""Jack and Jill"" is out of their mind. This book is not even CLOSE to as good as those wonderful reads. Nevertheless, I did enjoy reading ""Mary, Mary"" and will absolutely read the next Alex Cross book (although I certainly hope that Patterson takes his time with the next one and at least TRIES to live up to his abilities as shown in KTG and J&J)."
2,"Been there, done that","Some of the scenes are quite predictable, and some of it is a typical Hollywood movie. Also, it puts too much emphasis on the character`s personal life, which to me was quite boring. I read it in 2 nights, not because it was interesting, just because I wanted to get through it once and for all."
3,Mediocre....,"""Mary, Mary"" by James Patterson was a mediocre read. I am not very interested in murder/mystery novels, but I figured would give this one a chance. I did not enjoy some word use from the author. He used a great amount of vulgarity which I thought he could have done without. Also, Patterson used some acronyms that I was not familiar with. The acronyms were a bit discouraging. I enjoyed the plot and the way Patterson slipped in family time and other interesting side stories. All in all, I would recommend this book, but I would not read it again."
4,Well James...What's Next?,"I thought this was an entertaining read, however it did focus a lot on family and it will be interesting to see if Alex returns to the FBI. I personally would be disappointed if he didn't because it will screw up the whole Cross series. The Alex Cross novels are the best crime drama's Patterson has ever put out and it's too soon for him to call it quits. Also, another thing about this novel, I was expecting the killer to actually be someone else...Definatly worth checking out for yourself!"
4,BEATS THE HECK OUTTA EGGS,"THIS IS A VERY SMALL WHISK TO BE USED FOR VERY SMALL JOBS - GUESS THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT A MINI WHISK - IT'S GREAT FOR EGGS, LIGHT SAUCES, HOT COCOA, ETC. - I LOVE TO COOK BUT I'M NOT MUCH FOR FOLLOWING RECIPES TO THE T - I'M MORE OF FEELING COOK - A DASH HERE A PINCH THERE AND IF I FEEL IT NEEDS A LITTLE SOMETHING ELSE WELL THERE'S ALWAYS THE OLD STAND BY OF A DROLLOP ......... IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT HOW THE UTENSILS I'M WORKING WITH FEEL IN MY HANDS AND I LOVE THIS MINI WHISK BECAUSE THE HANDLE HAS WEIGHT TO IT NOT TOO MUCH - JUST ENOUGH."
4,very cute!,"this is a very cute whisk!I love it. it looks durable and morden.but To my disappointment, it is 'made in china'."
2,Un resumen de un buen libro que no se ha escrito aún,"El libro (¿folleto?) está sobrecalificado, el autor falla en desarrollar realmente los conceptos y lo poco que explica lo hace de manera repetitiva.Qué decepción me llevé cuando estaba leyendo con interés el primer acuerdo (el más importante según el autor) y de pronto aparece el título del segundo acuerdo.Más bien lo calificaría como un resumen de buen un libro que no se ha escrito aún."
3,Reminds me of a misogynistic male writer from the 30s.,"This is my first encounter with Ursula Guinn, and I'm uncomfortable with it and not impressed. True, the prose is well crafted, but the plots are twisted and bizarre, and it truly feels like a man is writing who has a dim view of females, which doesn't please me one bit. I'm not even half way through and not sure I'll finish. I am a great fan of fantasy, fiction and political non-fiction alike, so my typical range is broad. However, I think I'll try a different book, as this one is comprised of short stories with a devastatingly dark and gloomy feel to them. I've heard such great things about Ursula Guinn that I don't want to give up yet; perhaps I'll pick a new book of hers and start over with a clean slate."
5,Excellent Resource for Teaching...,"This is an excellent resource for teachers or those, like myself, who are training to be teachers. The chapters are concise and clear in explanation and have the added bonus of a little comic relief in the form of famous syndicated cartoons in nearly each chapter. Also, this textbook provides answers to some end of chapter problems as well as small biographical entries on famous mathematicians who helped mold math as we know it. It gives clear instruction, and is challenging without being overwhelming. An excellent textbook!"
3,A Problem Solving Approach to Mathematics for Elementary School Teachers,This textbook has great information for learning development but is not a good reference quide for a teacher.
3,Careful readers can be well rewarded for their efforts,In numerous instances there is too much detail. The book is full of useful information based upon the practical experience of the author.Experienced Project Managers can find some Gems that perhaps they have forgotten.New Project Managers will find many practical approaches that can be used in their projects.Managers in general can find the book useful in understanding what Project Managers do and what Project Mangement is all about.Students can use it as a reference.All-in-all it can be a useful addition to any library.
5,Excellent Pasta Spoon,"I have purchased plastic pasta spoons in the past, including a very well known brand and (allegedly) strong and durable. YUCK they all broke. This one is incredible. I make a lot of pasta dishes and this pasta spoon is the best I have found. Thank you Amazon for having this product available."
3,Average,"This was an average product. There is nothing special about it.It's a good idea to get it if you don't care about what kind of ball it is, you don't care how long it takes to get to you, or if you don't want to drive to get it.My advice is to just drive to the store so you can test it out and make sure that it is the one you want since you will be paying the same. This way you can get it immediately too."
4,Takes some breaking in,"We had a softplay volleyball before this one that had reached the end of its useful life. It was a great volleyball, though, so we decided to stick with the same brand. We use it for casual use, but pretty regularly in the summer and fall. Our first impression was that the ball was NOT soft at all - super hard out of the box. But with letting some air out and some breaking in, its what we expected - soft yet durable. Very pleased!"
1,Fell and stayed flat after 1 week,Fell and stayed flat after 1 week - thought it would be good but how can you use it if it stays flat
2,"Nope, Not Soft","Actually its down right HARD. Sheesh, I only kept it because its cool color. I even tried letting out some air, but no dice. Buy a regular ball instead."
2,Not as durable and strong as they say,The rubber grips were ripped by my medium sized jack russel and the nylon rings were chewed in half by my lab. This toy is not durable and safe for dogs that chew. I recieved it on saturday and by sunday it was destroyed.
1,Isn't kong supposed to be impossible to brake,We have had this item for only a few weeks and it is completely destroyed so I'm very disappointed in kong and will probably never buy any kong products again.
3,My dog is not a fan of this toy,"This tug is made of a hard plastic material with the black rubber connecting the two rings and protecting the ends of the toy. My lab mix just has no interest in this toy. I think it is because she does not like the hard plastic on the toy. When playing with other dogs, she hesitates playing tug with this toy and quickly finds something else to focus on. She is even reluctant to pick it up when I tell her to fetch.In general, the Kong toys have be a hit with my dog. This tug, however, is not a success in my home."
4,Good toy,"We have a 70 pound male boxer who is very spoiled with every toy imaginable! We've had this toy for him since he was a puppy. It's not his favorite, but if you pick it up and get him to tug on it he plays right along! It's held up very well!"
2,Not so strong,It was an ok product until my Dutch Shepherd destroyed it in about a day after I received it. I can't find a toy that he doesn't destroy.
2,Disappointed,I thought it looked tough but my dog ate it rather rapidly considering the cost of the toy. He is a big dog but not a bad chewer so it needs to be tougher. Give it a miss.
2,KONG Tug Dog Toy - Worth the Money?,"I have 2 dogs, both about 14 months old. One is a Boxer, the other is a Lab/Staffy mix. This was a great toy when my Boxer was a baby. She would chew on this and it stayed pretty true to the Kong reputation. She learned how to play tug-o-war with this toy. Fast forward a few months, and introduce my then 4-month old LabStaff into the mix. All of a sudden, not so great of a toy... All of the black rubber material was destroyed within 10 minutes. Then, he worked his way through the rest and pretty much made it look like a chewed-up Bic pen.I do feel inclined to mention that his teeth [literally] look like werewolf teeth and that he is part American Staffordshire Terrier.Here's my experience with this product:For puppies -- its a pretty good teething toy that lets you play with your puppy too. For strong-jawed, sharp-toothed dogs -- this toy won't last. In hindsight, it really doesn't look like it would survive that type of dog anyway."
2,Design gone wrong,"I volunteer at a no-kill animal shelter, and from time to time bring toys in for the dogs. I saw this toy, and figured it would be great for all the medium sized and large dogs there, for playing tug-of-war with me. Sadly, I was wrong. After a few times with larger dogs, it broke in half. Also, some of the dogs didn't want to play tug-of-war with this toy (I don't know why), and chose others to play with."
1,Flawed Design,"Bought this tug based on the good reputation of the Kong brand. All other Kong toys have held up very, very well. This tug only has ""Kong rubber"" at the ends and in the middle. The sides are exposed, red plastic. Our dogs immediately went to work on the red plastic and had it torn apart in 2 days. If only Kong had put it's rubber all over the toy, it probably would have held up for a long time and become a favorite toy with my dogs."
1,waste of money,"I bought this toy and spent $14 on it. Took it home to my medium size dog, who destroyed it in less than 15 minutes. The reason I bought this toy is because I have another Kong which my dog hasn't been able to break at all. However, this new toy is of very inferior quality even though it has the brand Kong attached to it. Don't buy this product unless your dog is a tiny Chihuahua with no jaw power at all. Otherwise you'll waste your money."
1,"I like Nicolas Cage,but this really wasn't his movie.","Nicolas Cage is definitely my favorite actor. I bought this movie just to add to my collection. I didn't know it would be such a dumb movie. If you like porno,this is definitely your movie, but I don't like that stuff, so it stunk!"
3,Served it 's purpose,"I bought a big clunky bohemian ring which I fell in love with but unfortunately was about 2 sizes larger& it was the last one left, because it was custom jewelry I really didnt want to spend too much $$ on resizing it, these guards did the trick and because it came in a box of different sizes I had the right ones to choose from."
2,Buyer beware.,"I bought one of these watches in 1985. It was a tank. It took much abuse and kept on running. Because of the heaviness of the watch the band would break often and hit the asphalt/concrete. After a few years of repeated bonking on the hard surfaces it finally quit. (I wish i had put a good fabric band on it). Anyway, i bought one of these watches last year (2010) and it was a creampuff. Any jar to my arm and it would stop running. Very disappointing. This is the only watch i really desire to own, but because of the unreliability i had to leave it in the fond memories of yesteryear. ( I actually bought a sport model Seiko automatic before i made this purchase in 2010---same problem. I sent both watches back and opted for the SKA413.) Inferior construction/materials for the automatics nowadays? Not sure."
1,Stops without notice,"The watch looks nice, however after few days of use, it stops working without any reason. We tried reading the manual, kept using it to see if was some mistake, but it stopped again when we were out of the country last week. I don't want this watch anymore!"
5,A Jubilant Song indeed,I bought this album for the Norman Dello Joio piece because I remember performing it as a kid in high school choir. The piano accompaniment always gave me chills. Well of course I was delightfully suprised by the other great pieces on here (mostly Baroque and French). This is a wonderful album and Patricia has a very energetic voice that works very well with the music.
2,This is Public Domain now,"I have used this particular package for studying Igbo, I would say it's pretty thorough, the audio drills have to be used along with the booklet. This sort of format can become a bit repetitive but It's an ideal way to learn for many. One just has to stick with it. I did not buy it buy it though ,it is available for free at the fsi.com website, along with many other languages in this particular format.[....]"
1,DO NOT BUY DAEWOO: DVD PLAYER BROKE DOWN AFTER ONLY 17 PLAYS,"I was so excited when my Daddy gave this to me as a present-it was my first DVD player! When it worked, it worked OK. But after playing just 17 DVDs, it came up with ""NO DISK"" error when trying to load a DVD. My Daddy looked in the user manual's ""Troubleshooting"" section (written in rather bad English, by the way-even I could see that), saw advice to leave the player on with no disk inserted, in case there was condensation inside. He did that many, many times over many, many days, but we still got ""NO DISK"" error for every DVD, even though every one of those DVDs would play without any problem in another cheap portable DVD player we went and bought. He could not find any way to contact Daewoo customer support. Spend your money on a better brand product. No more Daewoo products for us."
3,"if you can't read French, read another version","George Bernanos based his story on Gertrud Von Le Forts ""Song at the Scaffold"".....this book is in English and is incredibly beautiful .....much more so than the book by Bernanos"
3,Revelations abound...,"If I wanted to read a self-help book I would have picked one up, not Wish by Melina Gerosa Bellows. This book was an average read, funny and lighthearted. Sometimes. The book was way to introspective. It referred to too many cliches of ""finding yourself"" what ""true"" happiness was, what can you learn from all bad experiences etc, and all kind of psychological issues- the Gray Cloud, the Elephant in the room, all stemming from the stress that comes with living with her autistic brother Bobby and trying to make up for his imperfectness. Her parents, are most of time, too involved with Bobby to even notice Bella and it was kind of like she had raise herself. Which I did sympathize with but I really didn't want to sit in on the painful therapy sessions of the main character Bella. When she wasn't dealling with family or psychological issues the book was funny as Bella navigated the perils of the dating career worlds."
3,From the master himself,"This book is useful because in its first part it reproduces Joseph Pilates' own instructions and photos for his classic set of exercises. Instructions are brief, photos are mediocre, but it's useful to have this to compare with the best of contemporary instruction books like those of Siler and Ungaro. Interesting that even the teachers who teach the ""classical"" Pilates don't duplicate the original exercises completely. The second half of the book, philosophy about life, mind, body etc I found quite dispensable."
2,The Original Master,"There are many Pilates teachers out there, but this particular book, ""A Pilates' Primer,"" by Joseph Pilates is the one sure guideline for mastery of the practice."
4,+ 1/2 stars...The Dubliners From Their Mid-60s Peak,"The Dubliners are the antithesis of the clean-cut image of such popular Irish bands as the Chieftains and the Clancy Brothers. These were hard-drinking Irishmen who add a grittier edge to their music.The 42 tracks on this collection are all taken from the handful of albums and EP's they recorded for Transatlantic in the mid-Sixties, beginning with their debut from 1964: THE DUBLINERS AND LUKE KELLY. Many of the selections are live, including all of the tracks from 1965's THE DUBLINER'S LIVE IN CONCERT.If you love Irish music and your collection doesn't include anything by this influential band, this a great place to start. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
2,Not so great...,"Lot's of East coast restaurants, not so great if you live in the west. Also for the restaurants that are in west, most of the entries are no longer offered. Pretty much was useless for me."
3,Not recommended outside the U.S.A.,"I also purchased one of Jorge's other books, ""The Belly Fat Cure"" (which i very highly recommend) in the same book order, however, i feel that i wasted my money on this one. It is very well written and would be handy for anyone living in the U.S. however since i live in Australia, even though we have many of the same fast-food outlets, the menus are apparently VERY different. There was not a single fast-food option in the whole book that was relevant to Australia, and i would bet this is similar in other foreign countries as well.This is of course thru no fault of the author/publisher, but should serve as a warning to anyone living outside the U.S. considering to purchase this book - think twice!For American buyers, it is a very convenient pocket size for taking ""on the go"", and has great very straight forward suggestions on what to eat and where. I imagine it would make meal choices easy for those away from home. I only wish it was relevant to me! :("
1,Just trying to make money,"I bought this book along with the Belly Fat Cure. In this book he advocates certain things, like SPlenda and carbs. IN the other book, he know claims Splenda is bad and so are carbs. This book is information most people already know about, Portion control. I did sign up for his newsletter, I laugh everytime I seen a video on him. I guess in 3=4 years he will come out the another book contridicting his other two books. Will not recommend."
4,Fun and Clever and Stylish and Neat!,"As low-budget sci-fi movies go, this one is pretty damn good! Sure, if you think too much about it afterwards, there are flaws to be found, plot-wise. But... if you appreciate a good brain-twisting-thriller-sci-fi with a light touch of dark comedy, some very cool cinemnatic 'moments' and a quick pace, this is some good, yummy stuff!For people who appreciate Brain Dead, ReAnimator, and other ultra-clever b-movie sci-fi/horror/fantasy extravaganzas!!!"
3,Anything But Bey Right Now,"I've heard a few snippets from this forthcoming release. Based on the reviews, I'll especially be glad when it hits stores. If I hear one more Beyonce song... And what was all that buzz about Rhianna's new CD. Pure garbage."
3,More funny than one would expect.,"It really wasn't so bad. As far as Wayans brothers come and go, Damon is one of the funniest. The film manages to blend convincing moments of tension and drama amidst occasional moments of hilarity. And believe it or not, there is actually a plot. It's one of the more genuinely amusing films to come out of the ""new jack swing"" era, and way funnier than anything in the Scary Movie franchise. That's fo sho."
3,Not my favorite Iz CD.,"E kala mai, but this album did not come close to surpassing any of his other releases. I like some of the songs more than others, such as ""Margarita"" and ""You Don't Know Me,"" a duet with Teresa Bright.However, I had already had ""Facing Future"" before I got this one, and I personally do not care for the version of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World"" on this CD. Way too contemporary for me... which leads me to another thing: I believe there are too many contemporary songs and not enough Hawaiian language songs.I would not recommend this for anyone who is interested in discovering Iz. His other CD's are better."
4,There's more to an album than a 30 second soundbite,"If you are looking for ethereal melodies, ""Kana'i Aupuni"" is hauntingly beautiful. The version of ""Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World"" here isn't the one most are familiar with (it's found on the Meet Joe Black soundtrack and Iz's ""Facing Fututure"" album) but it's pretty groovy in its own right with its reggae inspiration. This is an early album, and it does suffer somewhat from overproduction, but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. This album will most likely appeal more to people who are already fans of Iz than people who have never heard him before, but everyone should have one of his albums in their collection."
4,IZ IS THE MAN,"I FIRST HEARD OF ISRAEL KAMAKAWIWO,OLE IN 1998 WHILE VISITING MAUI FOR THE FIRST TIME.HIS SOUND IS SO GENUINE AND SOOTHING IT INSPIRED ME TO PURCHASE HIS ENTIRE CATALOGE.MY WIFE AND I LISTEN TO A DIFFERENT C.D. EACH NIGHT WHILE FALLING ASLEEP.WE ARE TAKEN FROM THE MAINLAND TO THE ISLANDS EVERY TIME WE HEAR HIS WOUNDERFULL VOICE.I SHARE MY DISCOVERY OF THIS WOUNDERFULL MAN TO ALL OF MY FREINDS AND FAMILY AND THEY TO ARE SOOTHED BY HIS SWEET SOUNDS"
4,Nobel Prize Winning Book,"As a trained economist, I appreciated the insider's view of economic history that Stigler provides. His intimate recollection of the famous Chicago School of Economics, its professors, and ideas make this book well worth buying. An economic historian by trade and passion, Stigler has a knack for vividly recalling key events. He discusses his relationships with famous economists such as Friedman and Beck. He also provides detail of how certain ideas crept into the mainstream of economic theory. For example, Stigler warmly recalls the `eureka' moment when Ronald Coase convinced his colleagues at the Chicago School of the logic supporting the Coase Theorem. That alone makes this book well worth it."
5,official Savage Resurrection CD back in print,"The Savage Resurrection cd is finally repressed & back in stock as of April 2008. Originally issued on CD by Mod Lang in '99 the CD has been out of print for a few years & annoyingly been bootlegged, but we have the official Mod Lang label, band sanctioned reissue back in stock now!This classic bay area acid rock LP was originally released on the Mercury label in 1968. This CD issue (ML007) gives you the 10 track original album plus 3 previously unreleased versions/ tracks with extensive & informative liner notes by Alec Palao, who included a Savage Resurrection track on the Grammy nominated LOVE IS THE SONG WE SING: SAN FRANCISCO NUGGETS 1965-1970 box set. Also included are a forward by Nick Saloman (Bevis Frond/ psychic circle), beautifully restored original artwork, never before seen pics & more."
2,Disappointing,"As I approached ending my story of six summers I wanted to get the Black Hand and others involved, give the players, all fairly powerful by now, some intense challenges. However while this book gave information on the types of Kindred who run in this secret groups it didn't really give me much guidance in creating NPCs. No big list of sample characters or detailed instructions on how to create them. I was disappointed -- I could have made those NPCs without the book frankly."
4,Nice Display - But Not Quite Perfect,"I just mounted my first yellow belt certificate and my old white belt on the display. The certificate (8.5x11) fit perfectly. The included belt holder was attached to the frame easily enough with the two included screws and it appears to be strong. Note that I couldn't find the belt holder attachment screws at first. Then I found 2 tiny little wood screws taped to the back of the frame.My only concern is the little metal tabs that secure the certificate in the back of the frame. I imagine that by the time I make it all the way to black belt, these tabs will break off. It should be easy enough to remedy the situation with a small nail or a staple or something and it's a hidden issue to I'm not overly concerned with it.While just the single (white) belt below the frame is pretty lonely, the display looks very nice!"
5,ryka womens sportwalker shoes,"perfect product,exactly what i wanted. the shoes fit great,and are very comfortable. good doing business with amazon.thanks."
3,Thought I was getting a Concert DVD,"Just came in the mail last night. Couldn't wait to play it. It's NOT a concert. It's a Documentary. I was very disappointed. Nobody's fault but mine. Guess I wasn't paying attention when I bought it. I'll keep it for later when I feel like watching a Documentary, but right now I am going to go find a concert DVD of them."
5,Fabulous Buy!,What a great pair of earrings! I can't tell you how often I wear these. They are the perfect size for everything. Thanks again for a terrific purchase.
4,Not Quite,"I found this one did not measure up to the previous books. The others held my interest untill I finished the book, this one lost me a few times.I still love the concept of a talking cat."
4,My Review,I enjoyed this book very much. The quality of suspense was almost up to the level of the previous books. I recommend this to others who have been reading this series.
4,Another winner,"SRM's Cat mysteries were suggested to me by a dear friend and cat lover, and I have been eagerly awaiting each new installment. This one did not disappoint me. I am very pleased the SRM's character quality and plots do not suffer as the series goes on, such as some of the other cat mysteries series have. I love the interactions between the cats, and that Joe Grey has a delightful sense of humor. Shirley Murphy answers the question many of us ponder - ""If our pets could talk, what would they say?"" Her plots are interesting and never recycled. I highly recommend this series to any one who loves cat mysteries, or is looking for a good book to curl up with on a rainy day. Be sure to read all of her books, because she often refers to past incidents (and all her books are wonderful), but it is not necessary to understand what's going on. I hope Murphy continues to entertain us for years to come."
5,Just amazing...,"I love the character development and the changing relationships between the characters. Tanya Huff gives us a lot of action, suspense, and different forms of love: romantic, sibling-love, friendship, and love twisted by madness & bitterness. The writing is deep without being overtly philosophical. No Quarter is a fast-paced, edgy story about Gyhard, a man without a body of his own, sharing the flesh of Vree, the woman he loves. Vree is a former assassin, pursued by her brother, who wishes them to return to the army--and who wishes to kill Gyhard. And in the middle of this turmoil, an ancient, insane murderer walks, raising the dead around him. The old man still loves Gyhard, but the only way he could get Gyhard to stay with him would be to kill Gyhard and Sing his living kigh back into his dead body...A truly excellent read."
3,Meh....,I need a smaller file box for some things I need to keep separate from my big filing cabinet so this was the perfect size. I have a big one I got at Costco 15 years ago and it's still going strong so I was hopeful with this.Pros: It has hanging bars in it and comes with 4 or 5 hanging folders which was nice. The size is good if you don't have a lot of stuff.Cons: It is a speckled blue aka granite. The lock is waiting to break. The entire thing is sturdy enough but if it gets hit on something it is going to crack.This is fine if you are just sticking it in the closet or around the house. I can't see this thing lasting if it is going in and out of cars and being treated a little rough.
4,nice but sizing not quite right,"The dimensions given for this box is 11""H x 14""W x 6 1/2""D.Be aware that the inside dimensions for usable space are actually: 10""H x 12""W x 5""DI was needing this to be bigger and trusted the sizes. Who cares what size it is on the outside. We have to use the inside.Other than that, the box is nice and has a lip for hanging file folders (though I didn't need that)."
5,One of the best hip hop albums form the mid-90's!,This album by Eightball and MJG is really another classic hip hop album many poeple that grew up in the early 90's can definently relate to what I am saying because the music was pure energy and talent just what the duo Eightball and MJG is giving you on this album. A classic for sure sitting on top of the world.
5,best cd ever,friend or foe is one of my all time favorite songs this cd is hella tight its one of the few cds that you can listen straight through with out skippin corny *** songs. i give this album 10 stars.
4,It's like an treasure,"The books is excellent because offer a lot of ideas for all ocassions and for all ages. The materials are easy to found. It's great for summer camps, sunday school and for the kids in school. I don't know how usefull will be this collection of books."
5,Thorough and informative,"I bought this book for reference while taking a Modern History of Asia class - I ended up reading the whole thing! Informative, interesting and a great resource for the 3 papers on Japan I wrote."
5,One kickin book!,"I thought that ""American Psycho,"" was a great book. I found it hard to put down, and read in anticipation of what Bateman will do next. The chapters on each musical artist show how vapid and shallow Bateman is, because each artist to me seems vapid. I envision Patrick sharing the information on each artist with a victom that he is torturing. This book has many levels, and each one is great: The 80's culture of call-waiting and club-findings, the mistreatement of homeless people, and the running joke with the Patty Winters show. The fact that Bateman tells certain people of his deeds and actions, and they either don't listen or don't get it...that's pure genious! If you don't get this book, then read it again, and then if you still don't well I'm sorry."
2,rambling details,"Maybe the symbolism of this book is totally lost on me. Ellis takes up way too much book space describing in irritating detail what each person is wearing. Ok, the bums don't get a fashion summary but all the other well to do characters (whether we are given their names of not) has their wardrobe described in detail. I think we get the point right from the beginning that these people are wealthy yuppies. I have just begun to read the book and find myself skipping over sections where Ellis describes people and their outfits. Don't waste your money, people. I haven't seen the movie but if you feel you must find out about all the hype that went with this book and movie, do yourself a favor and go see the film. Save yourself the irritation of this man's ramblings."
1,pretty shocking....yawn,"Bret Easton Ellis' first novel (Less than Zero) reads like the first draft of a ninth graders book report. This novel isn't much better. Full of one-dimensional characters, empty dialog that leads nowhere and exposes nothing but the obvious, and completely unbelievable situations. Not to mention lazy writing; it's painfully obvious Ellis has absolutely no idea what goes on on a day-to-day basis on Wall Street. Or at least he didn't bother to show us -- to actually flesh out the main character so we could understand a method to his madness. Oh well. I guess if he did, he might not have room for the Genesis album reviews or to re-hash the scenes from his first novel, Less than Zero. Conclusion: Ellis just isn't ambititious or talented enough to pull something like this off with any success."
1,Ug! Painful!,Worst book I have ever read!! If you are a male clothes horse of the '80's you might enjoy the VERY DETAILED descriptions of every outfit that every character in every scene is wearing right down to socks and sunglasses. I found it distracting and not relevent to the story line.
2,"TOO MUCH FASHION, NOT ENOUGH KILLING","I expected to read lots of scenes of torture and murder. Half the book is a list of clothing stores and foodplaces for meaningless, worthless yuppies. There is only a little violence peppered throughout the pages. Where's the beef?"
1,Trash,The endless descriptions of what the characters are wearing...wears thin after the first couple of chapters. Boooorrrrinnnngggg.
1,"Much, Much Less Than Zero","I hope Simon and Schuster turned it down not because of the explicit scenes but because this novel would not even merit reading in an undergraduate creative writing workshop. Hey Brett, read Gardner's The Art of Fiction; maybe you will finally learn something. What a piece of garbage. If this is the future of American fiction, then we are all in for one gigantic aesthetic collapse."
4,Good,"Ya its a long book, its deeper than the movie, but I would def reccomend it. It goes into detail and explores the underlying instanitly/sanitly of Patrick Bateman"
3,Did it all really happen?,"After reading the book, being generally freaked out by the horror and gore, all I kept wondering is: ""Did it all really happen, or was it all Bateman's sick fantasy?"" I've seen other reviews with similar thoughts. I loved the way the book made fun of the '80's shallowness. I was there in the middle of it all and had to laugh (even at myself sometimes). All said, the book was alright. Deeper in plot than some people seem to be giving it credit for, but not as deep or as important as others are giving it. NOT for the timid, that's for sure."
1,Extremely disturbing...,"This book is the most disturbing thing I have ever read. If I could give it negative stars I would. The author is in need of professional help, anyone who could think up the sick things that are written in this book has something very wrong going on in his head. I don't believe in censorship but I am going to burn this book this weekend to completely exorcise it from my life."
2,"not too controversial, just a poorly written book","I am usually pretty accepting of controversial books, so I thought i'd enjoy this book a lot. Instead, I found this book to be extremely boring. First, its fun of unimportant information and monotonious events in Patrick's life. Sure, its supposed to show how materialistic the 80's were but after a few chapters the author just uses the same techniques to portray the matrerialism of the 80's. Second, it doesn't take very much skill to write about a psycho going around torturing women. There was really no plot in this novel, the characters were not very interesting, it wasn't very funny. The author did a terrible job with this novel so he probably added a lot of violent parts in this book that are not even scary, to create controversy, and provide more publicity for this book. Bottom line its a baaddd baaddd book, thats very very boring."
3,"Weeks later, I remain unsure.","How can one review a book which glorifies the bizarre and extreme sexual perversions of a madman? While I found myself violently repulsed often during the course of this novel, Ellis was trying to make a point about society. However, I have to wonder whether or not this was the smartest way to do it. Its written well, although not an incredible read."
3,Art imitating life?,"Was it necessary to have those chapters on ""Girls""? I was sick to my stomach reading the violent parts of the novel. However, I felt the commentary on society was right on the mark."
3,Gaaaaaaaaaaah!,"I think the reviewer who said ""liked the book, but now I have brain damage"" said it best.The book is hard to put down, whether you find yourself transfixed by Ellis's prolific ""product placements,"" (which I admit I did---so many brand names!) or the incredibly gory violence (which also transfixed me, especially when trying to fall asleep at night).That being said, I'm still not sure whether I'd call it a good book or not. A good *read*, yes, but that doesn't necessarily make the book itself good. If you want something to hold your attention, this book will do it."
4,"Chilling, gripping, infuriating.","I read this book in one sitting, about five years ago. I am quite sure that I skipped, consciously or otherwise, paragraph after paragraph. Nothing I have read or heard, before or since, has changed me in quite the same way. In his flat, recitative manner, Patrick Bateman makes you realise that the human condition encompasses states of mind that we prefer to believe can not exist. Whether his acts of violence are 'real', or seamlessly incorporated into his imaginary world, their impact remains, and you think again of all the historical acts of horror you have heard of or read about, and some idea of the reality, the pain and fear and despair suffered by the victims, will come to haunt you. One day, I will read this book again, but I'm not strong enough yet. The literary niceties elude me, but the knowledge that Patrick Bateman lives among us now, just as he always did, still frightens me."
1,"Horrible, atrocious, and no point","I bought this book to see what all the hype was about. I should have saved my money. This was the most disgusting, vile book I have ever read. People often wonder where children get there ideas to blow up schools and murder their peers. Material like this that falls into the wrong hands can do damage. I am a firm beliver in free speech, but when something like this is out to the general public I can't help but wonder who is reading this book and who will want to be just like the subject of the book. People don't like to blame the media, in reality media has alot to do with the acceptance of violence. Read this with caution, and parents be aware what your children view and read."
3,One sick BASTARD,"The protaganast of this book is deepest, most vile creature I can ever remember being put into print. I understand movie rights are sold. I still don't quite understand why the book was written - what point does it serve? - some may feel this is a silly question (why should fiction have a point?) but I feel a book that doesn't entertain should at least say something"
1,Are You Kidding?,"... I first learned about ""AP"" by reading a True Crime classic, ""Lethal Marriage"" by Nick Pron. Paul Bernardo, the killer of that book, loved ""AP"". What a recommendation! Perhaps I was turned off by a work of fiction. As a native New Yorker, I was definitely turned off by the completely unbelieveable scenes and description of the City. We do NOT live this way! With so many superior works of true to life, cold blooded sickos available with the click of one's mouse, why waste time reading about sickos who never existed? Those who have read this far and are unfamiliar with ""Lethal Marriage"" should [check it out]. There is a reason why authors like Ann Rule are popular and ""AP"" is a perfect demonstration. Truth is indeed stanger than fiction-and it makes better reading."
1,Terrible Stuff,"This is not a good book. There are some things you don't want inside your head, and most of them are in American Psycho. There are scenes in this book that are gauranteed to have an emetic effect on the reader. Don't misunderstand me; freedom of speech is a principal I have built my life on, I value the First Amendment as much as the next wishy-washy liberal. But when ""art"" sinks to the levels of depravity found in this book, well, priorities have to be reevaluated. Mr. Ellis is an extremely limited writer; all his books are identical in style, mood and tone. He has no imagination except for horrific violence. Don't read this book. It may be a satire, but then so is Catch-22. Heller knew what he was doing. Ellis hasn't a clue."
1,Skip it!,"If you are interested in reading about a sick, twisted, narcissistic, shallow, obsessively stylish psychopath then read this disturbing novel. If you are looking for light and/or happy entertainment look elsewhere. Athough it's possible to consider it well-written I found this pretentious novel to be much like an annoying and insecure person who tries too hard to impress. My best word of advice: Skip it!"
5,THIS IS A GREAT BOOK,"I FOUND THIS BOOK DISTURBING, I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMEND FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT DOESN'T LIKE NORMAL BOOKS. I LIKE THE PARTS WHEN BATEMAN TALKED ABOUT MUSIC. HERE IN MEXICO WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE REST OF BRET EASTON ELLIS ' BOOKS"
3,I want to see someone make this a movie...,I read this book about six years ago and it still gives me the chills. This is not recommended for the weak. I don't think Leonardo would do the role any justice. Maybe Robert Downing Jr.
1,Faceless Hordes,"Some people have complained about the emptyness of this book. They rather miss the point: or, more accuratly, they do not see what is straight in front of them.In Dantes ""Inferno"", theres a place worse than Hell: the Plain of Tattered Banners, where those not even worth damnation run in the dust. This book is about one of these creatures attempt to escape. Like the ""Inferno"", it can be very funny.On a less dramatic note, it can be a bit too trendy at times: but then, theres only one Dante."
1,American Psycho,"I knew the premise of the book before reading, so the gore didn't exactly come as a surprise. I was prepared to be disgusted by the violence but no one prepared me for the mind-numbing, pages-long descriptions of what everyone in the room was wearing - the color, brand, quality of fabric, blah blah blah. I get that this obsessiveness serves as insight into the unhinged mind of Patrick Bateman, but my god, is it endlessly boring.I will grant the business card scene is fantastic, although it is not enough to make up for the crapfest this book is."
3,like it or not,"I found this novel to be very funny, at times i found myself laughing out loud. I didnt find this book to be very offensive, but I am sure that people who hate four letter words and cant stand reading about pornographic violence will hate the book.What annoyed me most about this book was the constant use of clothing brands. It seemed as if they would never end.Overall I found this book to be enjoyable. I like how it kept me thinking what will happen next, and what? did he actually do that?"
4,"important, but...be warned","A good book. An important book, but be warned. It contains unmatched scenes of graphic violence.This book will haunt you afterwards for a long time. Sometimes that's bad, but, more often it's good"
3,Scared the hell out of me!,"My friend gave me this book to read before seeing the movie (movie was actually very good!) telling me, ""I dare you not to scream and chuck the book across the room at least once while your reading it! "" Well, I didn't live up to her dare, close though! The book in itself has some really funny moments (I know some people think the clothing/wallet/resturant parts are boring, I thought they were hysterical). It then does a complete 180 around page 150 and turns to full throttle disturbing horror. I was scared out of my mind in the day it took me to read this. I was thoroughly disturbed when I finished the book and quickly wanted it out of my sight. More power to people who can read this one twice, I myself cannot. I will never look at anyone in an Armani suit with a firm handshake the same way again!"
5,Misunderstood Masterpiece,"This is a masterpiece of modern horror. I have to laugh at the reviewers here who are trying to judge this book using a typical novel as a point of reference.It's fairly obvious early on that this isn't a novel in any conventional sense of the word, and trying to review it as such is nothing short of complete idiocy. If anything, American Psycho is a diary - a look inside this guy's mind. It's written in the first person, for God's sake! How can anyone expect cohesion, a good storyline, and proper character developement when the words are coming from a guy who - among other things - drilled around one of his victim's mouth to get a wider opening?Have I mentioned that I'm wearing Armani as I write this?Granted, this isn't for everyone. But expecting American Psycho to be something it was never intended to be is silly. If you want something completely horrifying and different, this book is for you. If you don't, perhaps a good Lisa Scottoline novel...."
5,Horror Show,"To say the least, American Psycho is one of the most intense novels I have ever set eyes on. It fascinates me how Patrick Bateman (the psycho) can go from an elite, well-off, respected white-collar worker, to a madman on the outskirts of the most sickest of fantasies. The creation of Bateman's character is phenominal, and you will enjoy flipping along with his crazy mind. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK"
2,PSYCHOBABBLE,"I couldn't wait to finish this book- so I could read something good. Read this if you want a blow by blow review of the music of Whitney Houston and Huey Lewis. Or if you have to know down to the smallest detail what each person encountered is wearing-I mean a description of the clothes, the designer, etc. Or if you want to know all sorts of strange chi-chi recipes,and their prices, supposedly served in all these overly rated restaurants. Then throw in some hard core sex and blood and gore and VOILA- you got a boring mish-mash."
3,Yuppiedom Unbound,"I'm in the ""good read"" camp. While it reads sometimes as a 1986 Zagat's Guide to New York Dining, the physical assaults on Bateman's victims will put the kabosh on any hunger pains Ellis might have stirred in you. Methinks the objections to the content of the book come from the same people who would never admit to slowing down on the highway to rubberneck at a spectacular car crash. American Psycho is merely an exercise in morbid curiosity, so after I recovered from the self-loathing induced by my unwillingness to put the book down, I began to appreciate the satirical aspects of the story. It's a spot-on take on the materialism, greed, and narcissism of the 80s, a real trip down Memory Lane for those of us who came of age circa 1987. So forgive yourself in advance for liking the book if you do - it doesn't mean you're automatically of the same ilk as Patrick Bateman or condone his nocturnal activities."
3,I talk to God but the sky is empty,"If anyone is feeling nostalgic about the 80's, then read this novel and you will soon get over it. Thatcher's 80's was just as much of a nightmare as Reagan's and it is important to remember how close we were to total nuclear holocaust."
1,Very Poorly Written,"This is without a doubt the worse novel I have ever read. The storyline is comical at best. The characters are not developed at all. There is no plot what-so-ever. To top it all off, the distinction between illusion and reality is never addressed. This unfortunantly could have been the saving grace of the novel. After viewing the movie, which is identical to the book, I've concluded that both are nothing more than a waste of space and time. The plot of the movie, similiar to that of the novel, is comical. The characters are not developed. The distinction between Patrick Bateman's illusions and his reality are non-existant. After watching the movie, I've concluded that the movie is far worse than the book. I gave the book 1 star, only because this was the lowest rating available."
3,"Wonderful at first, but you begin to loose interest...","this book started off splendidly and it was one of the greatest books I had ever read, but then , it just gets really repetitive and boring...if this book was maybe 100 pages shorter it would be great, but it is too long for a book with no plot and interest is eventually lost..."
3,"Brutal, gory, sick, twisted.","If you like deep books, books that allow you to get into the mind of psychotics, you will like this book. However, it is extremely brutal in it's detail. Too over the top for me, even in a literary and artistic sense. Sick. The character is complex and interesting though, and that allows for a good read, but far from an easy read."
3,An ok read but a little long winded,"I wan't completly in love with this book but i think the name is pretty self explanitory 'american pyscho'.So if anyones complaining that the story is to gory,i think u should read the title of the book first.people were often described by what kinds of clothes they were wearing i often got bored with that and skipped it but i think its quite an important part that pat batemans life was so boring all he could think of was the their clothes. and of course killing them.according to some peoples beliefs everyone who can gain access to a weapon are going to murder and the ones who are being bullied might try out these tactics,please heaven forbid my children gain access to a butter knife,i better move the scissors too the might feel like stabbing me.not everyone has psychotic tendencies"
1,Don't be fooled by hype,"A juvenial attempt at grossing the audience out. Here's a tip for the author, readers enjoy a good STORY! Do we really need a description of the sound a brain makes as it separates from the skull? Aparently we do when the actual story itself is so weak. This reads as if it was written by a teenage boy raised on Beavis and Butthead. I can imagine Ellis at his typewritter as he finishes yet another drawn out description of sex and murder: ""heh, heh, that was cool!"" Grow up Bret and keep your demented fantasies to yourself."
4,APATHY MEETS DISULLUISIONMENT IN A MATERIAL WORLD,"ELLIS IS ONE OF THE FEW LITERARY MINDS THAT HAS THE CAPACITY TO SWALLOW THE READER TO THE POINT OF APATHETIC DESPERATION, AND THEN SPIT YOU OUT, BETTERED BY THE EXPERIENCE. NO OTHER BOOK, SANS ""THE BELL JAR"" EXPRESSES MORE KEENLY THE CAREENING EFFECT OF A SOCIETY OF EXCESSES ON THE MORTAL SOUL. BROKER BY DAY, SOCIOPATH BY NIGHT, ELLIS ILLUMINATES A LIFE FILLED TO THE BRIM BY EMPTY FILLERS, AND POP-CULTURE BY-PRODUCTS. YOUR BRAIN WILL SWIM BY THE NAMES, FACES, PLACES, AND REFERENCES THAT DELUDE THE PROSE. ELLIS ISN'T A PREACHER, HE ISN'T A DEVIL, HE'S THE VOICE IN THE NIGHT THAT AWAKENS YOU FROM THE NIGHTMARE YOU'VE BEEN HAVING-AMERICAN PSYCHO IS A NOVEL THAT DOES JUST THAT. IT ILLUMINATES THE DESPERATE SWINGS A SOUL CAN TAKE WHEN UNDERNOURISHED BY THE FALSE GAIETY OF A SOCIETY PLAGUED BY IMAGE CONSCIOUS FACISTS. I RECCOMEND READING IT FOR THE GODIVA CHOCOLATE SEEN ALONE!-NOT FOR THE WEAK OF HEART OR STOMACH."
1,Catalog or novel?,"I must admit - I bought this book because, like many others, I wanted to see if the descriptions of the main character's actions were really as stomach-turning as I had been hearing. They were. I only got about halfway through the second (or third) chapter before I couldn't take it anymore. I never even got to any violence. The chapter I gave up on was about him shaving. SHAVING!! No glimpse into his thoughts of any kind while shaving, just shaving. The most repulsive part was the yuppie toiletry catalog that it turned out to be. It made me wonder if he didn't kill his victims with the pungence of scented soaps, creams and mousses emanating from his face. This review is 1-star because I couldn't choose negative numbers."
3,"All around ""ok"" book, not a great find","I bought this book because of the reviews it got on Amazon. The book isent even really that great, I mean its a fun read and all, but nothing great. Its preaty funny how the violence is obviosuly just put in there for people like me to buy it, i mean, sometimes he just describes stuff so much it just makes you laugh, while you get sick. Get it if you just feal like reading something sick, the only reason people give it rave reviews is because there is really nothing out there that is as easy to come by as this book that is this ""sick"".."
3,Am I the only one who finds this book overrated?,"I just had the worst time getting into it. It felt more like an assignment than anything has since high school. I kept reading it, thinking it would redeem itself. But it just kept putting me to sleep."
1,One of the Worst,Probably one of the worst books I have ever read. The author goes into agonizing details about every characters' wardrobe every time a character is introduced! The book is so dated that I struggled with remembering the details of the early eighties. I actually threw this book out in an airport because I did not want anyone to have to go through the pain I did.
3,An Acquired Taste,"I loved the movie and thought it was very scary, just the idea that there existed a world where everyone is so self absorbed that this man could carry out and almost confess to these crimes to so many other people and still not be ""caught"" is a terrifying concept to me. However, this book is very difficult to read. Be ready for detailed descriptions of every item that he and his cohorts own or covet from clothes to electronics to music. I suppose the descriptions of these items (down to the minutia) is meant to demonstrate just how meaningless his existence is and his struggle to make something meaningful of it but it is simply irritating. Which may be the point in and of itself because I found myself much more able to sympathize with his murderous urges after simply reading page after page of it. It is a truly terrifying concept and makes us think twice about the people around us but as my title says, its an acquired taste."
5,Perfect for Beginning Lessons,"Since deciding to learn to play guitar, I have purchased THREE different books, and this one is the only book I use. Despite the fact that this is the only book that doesn't have an attached CD, it is the most useful!! The author's 30 years of teaching experience shines through, particularly if you allow yourself to read through the text and then try the lessons (don't skip around). Each page builds on the previous lessons, and you'll be playing simple tunes in no time.I *HIGHLY* recommend this book above all others."
2,Not too great for beginners,"I ordered this for my husband to go with a new guitar that he received. I read the reviews on this that indicated that this book would be really helpful for a beginner. And truly the first pages were good. But when he got to reading music, the book was very confusing and not very detailed. We are now in the process of getting a book that explains that more clearly."
2,no all that in a bag of chips,i took lessons before and honeslty this didn't help as much as an indivdual teacher and i am used to learning on my own.
2,Book,"The book has alot of info but it does jump from one subject to the next very confusing, If I had to do it again I would go to a book store and pick one out after reviewing it."
5,Great.,"Got it the same day I got my Kindle. It's great, easy to follow and very helpful. As soon as I opened the book, I was being taught something, which really helped me play my guitar better. And I'm only writing more because Amazon is making me. All you need to know is that it's a great product at a decent price. What more?"
5,Great Guitar Book,"This is a great guitar book for everybody except for guitar players who know how to do everything that you can do on a guitar like Slash can. It tells you the basics, how to fingerpick, how to hammer-on and pull-off and many other things. It also gives you tips, many tunes to practice and master. It is a really good guitar book for virtually everyone. The only con is that the book is from 1970 something, so if you want a book for a young child, get something else. There are graphics but they're black and white and not terribly updated. They work though."
3,It's ok,I'm still working with this book. I'm a slow beginner but this book is very helpful. The jury is still out on this book.
3,For the price it's good.,"This is a pretty good series. It continues right from the mini-series but of course has different actors. They are NOT quite as engaging as the originals, but do alright. There are villains added of course, because without conflict there can be no drama. For the price it's good."
2,Dintopia TV series,"While the animation was very good and some of the story lines were interesting, I felt the performances of some of the actors were poor and an overall ""slickness"" spoiled the series for me."
3,disappointed in the ending......,"In other Hallmark shows, at least they had an ending for the series(Merlin,Alice in wonderland, etc..), but the ending for this series left the viewer hanging, and i hate when a series does that. I was hoping to see if they had a second season on here of dinotopia: the series, but to no avail, i have found none. Verry dissappointing..."
2,Hopefully this Remains only One Physicist's Vision,"I'm glad to see this book has people thinking about the concepts Fred presents. However, the book has more than one fatal flaw. Read this, but also read Frank Tipler'sThe Physics of Christianity.Now, I'm not implying Tipler's book is flawless. It isn't. But both books help the reader to grasp a clearer picture of what physics actually IS saying.My advice... whenever you read a claim that seems new to you, look for a reference in the endnotes. If the reference seems reputable, fine, if questionable, question the assertion. In either case, keep reading as new books are published. The definitive book hasn't yet been written on this subject."
1,Lexmark A DOG,Stay FAR FAR away from this printer. I brought two of these printers and although the quality of the prints was just fine the same errors codes come up again & again & again (on both printers).I wrote Lexmark & never received a response. The printers are now just paper weights & I moved on to Epson.
1,Disfunctional after 5 months,"I purchased this watch in June 2008. It was gently worn - never dropped, never worn in the water, etc. I did use the timers and alarms frequently. It quit working in November 2008. I took it in to have the battery replaced, and I was told it was not a battery issue. A new battery did not resolve the problem. The digital face just quit working. My last watch ran beautifully for 7 years. I'm not impressed with a 5 month life span. I have not tried to return it yet - hopefully the manufacturer will replace it. Regardless, I do not recommend the product."
5,A Must See,"Jesse Thunderwake: American Icon put simply, is a badass movie. There was points in the movie I couldn't stop laughing. The plot, cinematography, acting, andcurveballs thrown into the movie made it feel as if it had actually happened. One of the best movies I've seen in a while, definitely movie theatre worthy."
3,Missing Information,The description of the product misses information like the type and quantity of each atom that composes the kit.I really don't know if the best buy would be this kit or the Prentice Hall Molecular Model Set fot Organic Chemistry.
5,All Around Tough and Reliable,"I have had this type of watch for over 3 decades. I have surfed, dived, camped, hiked and otherwise abused the watch forever. Its always been there for me. I have to get a new watchband every few years, but the watch keeps on going in any conditions.I would recomend this watch or its close cousins to anyone with outdoor sports or activity interests."
2,"Great watch for the price, if it would last longer than 1.5 yrs","I bought this watch and I really enjoyed having it. Looks great, is comfortable to wear and water resistant. But my joy only lasted 1.5 yrs, then the watch started running fast, around 1.5 hrs per day. Repairing it would cost me almost as much as I paid for it. A watch like this should really last a little bit longer..."
1,Nothing to do with Ten Commandments,"Author's philosophy spun loosely around the Decalogue. Violates every principle of faithful exegesis. This book is not about the biblical text, though it claims to be an interpretive work. The author's ideas may seem attractive, but are not rooted in what the Ten Commandments really say, or what the original audience understood their meaning to be."
2,Disappointing At Best...,"Shai minus one member, plus new label, plus new production equals a severely disappointing ""Destiny"" for this group. Their abilities, creativity, and harmonizings are unquestionable. But they have strayed from what made them successful in the first place: harmony laced lyrics with dynamic sentiment. It's as though they regressed to the song ""Flava"" and built this album on that premise. It's obvious they are missing more than just a former member...they are missing who we knew as ""Shai""."
5,WONDERFUL program!!,"I am working on my 5th week of this program. I had a friend go through it and she is such a different person today! She conquered so many fears that she had-- so I have decided to try it myself. It deals with so much more than anxiety and stress-- but it helps you to see how you can change your thinking to help you overcome fears--helps you to look at things more positively. I agree with one of the other ppl about the person who wrote a negative review. You have to be totally willing for change in your life. And you have to be willing to WORK at making changes. I know in just 5 weeks it has helped me so much. Yes it's work, but I am sooooo much happier for it. I think that this is the GREATEST gift anyone can do for themselves-- if you are only willing to do it. I know it has helped me and so many other of my friends. So go for it. If you really put your effort into it, you won't be sorry! :)"
1,Sabatier Grand Chef 10 piece knife set,"The knife set I received did not arrive in new condition. The handles and blades were scuffed and worn. I was obviously sold a set that was VERY used. Also, the scissors that came w/the set were not the same as those described, they were a cheaper version than what was advertised and so was the block. I would have been better off buying a knife set at a garage/tag sale. The quality would most definitely have been better.Therefore, it is pointless to talk about the product since in all likehood you will not receive what you order."
4,very smoooth...,"this is an excellent chill-out album, and by chill-out I don't mean put you to sleep but just to relax. it was well put together. I feel that an overtly djayed up venture wouldn't have done these tracks justice, so I am pleased with it as whole and would recommend it to anyone with a desire to FUNK, soulfully of course!"
2,"What it is, is not what you think it is","Fans of Simple Things should not blindly drop their hard-earned cash on this CD before listening to a sample. Or better yet, read the small print on the back. This is a compilation CD with only one track by Zero 7. One track! Yet the cover leads you to believe the entire CD is Zero 7 and that we should expect the same great arrangements that we heard on Simple Things. Not so. I feel I've been had and you will too unless you're fans of Quasimoto, Roots Manuva, Slum Village, Cinematic Orchestra, Joy Zipper, Souls of Mischief, and other of bands that just roll off your tongue like Da Lata, Sylvia Striplin, Leroy Hudson, etc. Next time I'll read the fine print. Caveat emptor."
2,what a disappointment,"Well, I was really looking forward to this new album ""by zero 7"". With only one track by the band I dont class it as their album. I did like a couple of tracks from it but had i known it only had one track featuring zero 7 then i would not have purchased it. As for ""Simple Things"", what a classic it will be played by me until the cows come home."
5,A top pick for any serious military collection.,"The oversized presentation and maps packing The Military Atlas of World War II sets this publication apart from any other: for one thing, the maps are larger-sized and clearly marked, making it easy to locate details on invasions, operations, advances, landings and more. For another, it's accompanied by sidebars and headings of historical notes placing each map in perspective. In offering a visual guide in a larger folio edition, packing The Military Atlas of World War II offers the concurrent opportunity to clearly see the exact nature of the land, sea and air battles on all sides. A top pick for any serious military collection.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
1,a few extra cans of film,Jean luc is at it again. This time he shows his utter hate for his audience by presenting us with nothing just to see how we will again call him a genius.

2,Interesting Experiment,"If you are a big fan of Anything Box's first three albums, and want the same hook laden pop songs, then you may want to think twice about this album. I admire Claude S, for taking a chance and trying something new. This album is covered in new ideas that last for a minute or two and then that's it. And that's the problem. Anything Box never seem to fully complete or fill out any of the songs on this album. It's as if they quickly get bored with a track and move on to something else. It sometimes sounds as if this is a compilation album put together by a few various bands. ""Conscious"" was released as a single, but didn't do well. ""Negaverse"" is one of the few tracks that stand out to me. ""Autumn"" as well."
4,Departure...,"Some fans expected the polished synth-pop like on Peace or Hope. What Claude S. and Anything Box deliver is a lo fi groove trip. Kudos to the band for expanding and moving forward. There's some great material here and a plethora of moods as well. Some of my favorite songs are: ""Automatons,"" which is an honest look at many people's lives-in reality mundane. ""Doubt"" and ""Senses 5.5"" are groovy, spacey. ""Dirt,"" ""Autumn,"" and ""Need,"" are my 3 favorites. Those tracks to me are heartfelt, deep, and personal- just beautiful. There are lots of other good songs, several bonus tracks which is cool and the art work is off the hook. I highly recommend this band!"
2,"Just another disappointing punk ""reunion"" effort.","Throughout the 90s legendary 70s punk bands recorded reunion albums. Sorry to say most were tired efforts. This is no exception. This does not recall their 1977 masterpiece ""Life On the Line"" in anyway. It sounds more like an unsetteling mixture of AC/DC and Huey Lewis! If you want good ""reunion"" albums sniff out ""Trade Test Transmission"" by Buzzcocks, ""Not of this Earth"" by Damned, ""American Psycho"" by Misfits and ""Peace & Noise"" by Patti Smith."
4,Just great,"the quality image is nice and sound too, i really like this movie. i received the movie in mexico city om time"
3,The younger Sheen's pales in comparison to his father's,"Platoon is by no means a bad movie. In fact I rather liked it, but it just wasn't all that great. Charlie Sheen is fine for a nice cheesy comedy, but not really the right actor for something as weighty as this wants to be. And there's the other problem, this film thinks way too much of itself. *Gasp* violence! *Gasp* drugs! *Gasp* insanity! The viewer is told exactly what they are supposed to feel/think in this movie, rather than being given the opportunity to do so themselves. If you take something like Apocalypse Now, or Full Metal Jacket (also good but overrated in my opinion), the sense of insanity, of ""off-ness"", is simply there, not being lit up with neon signs. If you're looking for a good representation of the Vietnam War, or a political commentary on it, you can do better. Again, I did like it, but I strongly recommend renting this one before plunking down your dough."
3,Ughh,"I must say that Platoon really bugged me when I watched it. Being a true Apocalypse Now fan, I saw it mearly as a way for Charlie Sheen to capitalize on his dad's success. If you watch for it, it is painfully apparent throughout the movie. While it is supposedly ""true"" to how war actually is, I kept thinking of how obviously this movie is trying to become a hollywood blockbuster rather than a true art film. One of my major gripes with it was how strained the dialouge seems. Rarely is there any true emotion in the film and much of the movie is build on common war movie cliches both in the action and the acting. Otherwise, I thought it was a fine war film, but definately not the best Vietnam film ever. Apocalype Now takes that crown."
4,one of Stone's best movies,"Technically Accurate. but remember its ""Fiction"". well acted with a memorable score. along with a decent cast."
3,Charlie Sheene Fail,"This is certainly an action packed movie, showing the conflict between enemies and US soldiers. But Charlie Sheene simply cannot act. His performance is weak because he is only good for comedy, not drama. Otherwise it shows the horrors of the Vietnam war if that is what you want to see."
2,5 Star Movie....2 Star DVD,"Everyone knows the story of Platoon...the all-time best movie depicting the Vietnam War. However, I was very disappointed with the DVD especially the sound. Very few (a couple drops of rain and radio transmissions) portions of the film actually were in surround sound. A big disappointment for me. So if it's theatrical sound you're looking for in a war movie, get Saving Private Ryan, but if you're looking for a great movie depicting the Vietnam War, look no furhter."
5,The Rosenberg Magic Continues...,"I got on board 16 years ago, with thinking the cover was cool on the Sleeping Dragon. Ever since, I drop in a local store to see if Mr. Rosenberg happened to do a new book. The latest 'Not Exactly the Three Musketeers' captures the gritty, funny, REAL, fantasy, edge of what I come to know as Mr. Rosenberg's works. A little toung in cheek, but hammers home characters (ALWAYS the strength of his novels!) with SUCH lifelike style. I am already salivating for the next one, especially if he explains the Arta Myrdhyn mystery some time."
1,Bad Camera,"The quality is not real HD looking. The footage is jumpy. The camera is terrible in low light. Even indoors during the day, you have to blast light into the camera to get a readable image. I returned mine and I'm looking to getting the much better Sony HD cam which is almost double the price, but at least they were smart enough to put a video light on it. Being a professional filmmaker and knowing what Cameras shoot real HD, I quickly realized that I got ripped off. This may be good only if you're shooting mostly outdoors during the day, but don't expect to bring it to a party, club, or out on the town at night. It seems like they should have devoted effort to making the low light shooting excellent. The size of the camera is amazing and the fact that there are no tapes is great. I was really disappointed because I was expecting something better. Most digital cameras shoot better video, seriously!"
1,Do Not Buy - Black Screen Gets You In The End,"In my opinion this is not a marketable product. The cameras features are irrelevant if it does not work. There is clearly a design fault and the product should be withdrawn from sale until there is a fix. When it did work it was a convenient pocketable unit. As for HD - possibly at high noon in the Sahara, but in anything but perfect light the results are dissappointing."
4,Good movie...,"A sad, funny,touching story about a ditzy blonde with a heart, a black man trying to pull his life together & an adorable child needing love."
2,Better products out there,"I chose this walker because the label stated ""easy to fold"". Seeing how we live in a small place, I thought this would be a great space-saving investment. The truth is, it was quite difficult to fold up. When I finally was able to, I pinched my thumb while doing it. I'm a massage therapist, so I have somewhat strong arms and hands, but this was a killer...I'm not about to break a sweat every time I need to store it away in the closet.Also, the other reviewers are correct when they say that it does not move on carpet...not at all! I think I will shop around for another product, but will read all the parent reviews first before purchasing another."
2,Mozart has very little to do with it.,"While this film may have been a fun exercise for the director in constructing several narrative lines and some beautiful images, it is a muddled and disjointed film.Luckily I have some knowledge of French or I would have been even more at a loss than I was to understand what message,if any, this film wished to convey. The subtitles were few and far between and they were sorely needed in a movie with many story lines and so much dialogue dealing with philosophical matters."
4,"Great,but missing something.","I've been waiting for a taina cd!This is great but some songs are missing.The Maritza songs are great(she sounds a little better than Taina).The Dream and 3lw are good but I've never seen Dream on the show.Anyway,this is a great cd,but I had trouble finding it."

3,Works,"It works, has an OK price and lasted for about a year. Can't ask for more for something that cheap I guess."
5,This is a really excellent product,"The Able Tripod Cane Tip has so many good features it's hard to know where to begin. The cane stands by itself on most surfaces (the exception is spongy surfaces such as grass or very thick carpet). If it falls over, you can gently step on one of the ""pods"" and it will come back to an upright position. It makes going up steps much easier than using an old-fashioned quad cane and it is safer because it actually fits on the step. Most quad canes are very big and cumbersome especially when trying to go up or down steps. Due to it's slightly flexible nature, it is easier on my hand, wrist and shoulder than other canes I have used. It doesn't sink into soft surfaces like grass or sand which makes it much more reliable on those surfaces than a standard tip. I have used this tip on several canes now for over two years. I can't imagine doing without it, it is a great product."
2,The Cat Who Earned Two Stars,"The Cat Who Went Bananas, by Lilian Jackson Braun, is a rather slight novel that sadly seems to have been written for the sole purpose of producing a book, rather than telling a story. The paperthin plot does not inpsire much interest. I had a difficult time determining what the book was about and whether or not there was any mystery involved. I remembered somebody mentioning a person had died, and then there was a missing book, but I could not for the life of me remember why. This was my fourth book in the series, after starting with the first three. I think I had better continue with the series in order as the quality comparison between the first three and this one decreased drastically.Two stars."
3,Not her best work,"Ok people, after reading everyone else's reviews of this book, I first feel it extremely important to point out that LJB is almost NINETY!! Give the poor lady some credit for cranking out books, I know I still love her.This book was quite a disappointment. I was so eager to read it and was left with ""This was a mystery...but where was the actual mystery?"" Your perp turns out to be a hero in the end, and there was no climatic battle between Qwill and the bad guy. Koko seemed like a sidebar in this book.Ms. Braun has not lost her wit, I will most certainly applaud that. And I must also point out that there are TWENTY SEVEN TCW books... She is bound to slip just one time. If you are a die hard fan of the series (which I am) you will be disappointed in this book, but I would not skip it all together. Wait for the paperback price and continue to praise Ms. Braun in all her brillance for her previous wonderful mysteries."
2,not as bad as the previous one,"At least the newest Cat Who book is entertaining than the last one and has some semblance of a plot. Of course, it has all the hallmarks of a Cat Who book. The person that's new in town does a crime because they are the most suspicious, Qwill figures it out, unusual and pointless characters are introduced even if we have never heard of these oh-so-famous people before in the area, Qwill mentions at least once that his mother was a Mackintosh and has some strange new habit, and the plot is neatly wrapped up in the last chapter. (I should make a list of these and create a drinking game!)I like these books because I like the characters. They are not real mysteries at all and have not been for quite a while. I read each installment as a way to catch up with old friends and visit Moose County again. This series doesn't have much literary value, but it is entertaining for a short time."
2,More Long Tale than mystery,"I have read all of Ms. Braun's books and I'm sorry to say this is not up to standards. We are given all these clues to a mystery and no solutions. We never find out why Violet married, what happened to ""whiskers"" and there are a lot of other unanswered questions. This book seemed to be more of a vehicle for Qwill's little stories and the history of Pickax. More like a longer version of her ""Short & Long Tales"". As an interesting read about life and the inhabitants of Pickax it was very good, but definitely not in the same class as the first 20 Cat Who books. This was not a good ""who dun it"" and Koko was hardly involved or listened to. It may be time for her to stop writing mysteries and go with folksy stories."
1,I Give Up- This Series Has Lost It,"I've grimly hung on through the last two or three Cat Who books hoping they would get better, but each one gets progressively worse. If there is a mystery in the book, it goes unsolved. We hear a lot about Qwill's mustache and Koko's whiskers but nothing substantial. The charm of the characters of Moose County has worn very thin.In this book, it is almost as though the writer is attempting a stream of consciousness style of writing-- nothing holds together and everything just kind of rambles along until suddenly the book ends with no real sense of finality or resolution.I think it is time to put these books to rest. I don't plan to read any more in the series- I need to at least have a plot to follow and an actual mystery to try to solve."
2,"CLOSE, BUT NO CIGAR","This could have been a terrific installment of the ""Cat Who"" series. Quill found himself committed to writing a book about an ugly old house, but intrigued by some of the ugly stories hiding in the history of its inhabitants. I picked the book up on a Monday night and read half of it in one sitting - so far, so good. By the second sitting, I was intrigued with the story of the Hibbard family and what had happened to the missing baby and the daughter who killed herself. Then last night - ZIPPO! The book ended without telling us really anything. I cannot remember when I have been so disappointed. It was as if Ms. Braun got tired of writing and just quit. Come on! What happened to the ending?"
2,I was disappointed...,"I picked up this book expecting a mystery, and I was sorely disappointed. While I enjoyed the characters and the setting, and even the body of the plot, the ending was terrible! It felt like the author got tired of writing the book and just... stopped. It makes me wonder if the author knew the answer to any of the mysteries at all."
3,disappointed with the ending,"The book is a pleasure to read because of the cats but very disappointing because of the ending. I don't like Qwill that much because he is so smug - but I forgive him because of how lovely he is to the cats. The ending was very disappointing - so much so that I did a search because I thought I must be missing the last few chapters of the book. However, I see from the other reviews that I appear to have read the same ending as everyone else."
1,Is Lilian even writing these anymore?,"I'm highly suspicious, as has been mentioned in previous posts, that LBJ is even writing these anymore. They seem to get worse and worse. The Cat Who Went Bananas is the first book by LBJ that I haven't finished. It's also the last book by her that I'll read. Gone is the magicical interaction between Qwill, Koko and Yumm Yumm. I feel duped. Does anyone know if LBJ is even around anymore? Has anyone seen word of her doing book signings? I realize she is 89 this year (IF she's still around) but the pic on her books hasn't changed since the 60's. Something is up here folks, and I think we are being mislead by the publisher."
2,Where is the last chapter?,"This book begins weaving many plot threads and doesn't finish any of them. Somewhere there are several chapters that tell us the truth about the automobile death, the sniper death, the theft of the rare book, the kidnapping of the child so many years before, the suicide of the the child's mother, and Alden Wade's ""courtship"" of most of the eligible women in Pickax. I had trouble sleeping when I got to the end of the book. It was too much like real life where there are always questions left unanswered or unanswerable. I don't want that in the mysteries that I read."
2,What a Concept!,"Here's a concept for you: Take half a story, make the paper twice as thick, and call it a novel. Oh, and charge full price for it, of course. If I'd bought this book, I'd be reeeaaalllly ticked off; fortunately, I got it from the library, so I'm only really ticked off. As in many series that involve characters in a small town, the story goes gently nowhere for a long time. Finally, I'm finishing a chapter that ends with all the pertinent unsolved questions and thinking, ""At last, we're getting down to it."" I turn the page and . . . blank paper. About eight pages of blank paper. It's the end of the book. My advice is, wait 'til next January, get this one in paperback or at the library and get the rest of the story at the library if you can. Or if you even care by then. Bummer!"
2,Disappointing,"I own and have read every book in this series, and I have always loved them. This book was good until the end--there wasn't one. It was extremely disappointing."
2,Is Exploitation a Form of Rudeness?,"The dust jacket tells it all. Ms. Truss is a radio host and a newspaper columnist and this little book appears to be a quickly collected concoction of bits from her radio and journalistic lives designed to capitalize on Eats, Shoots and Leaves. The reader is predisposed to agree with the premise, but the contents are slap-dash and random. One can almost hear the radio host stream-of consciousness wanderings when reading this.Was Ms. Truss rude to pass this off on her public?"
2,Extremely boring,"""Talk to the Hand"" is an extremely boring book. Truss's other book ""Eats, Shoots & Leaves"" had very dry humor, but I enjoyed it more because I'm a grammar nerd. To me, it seems that this book was the publisher's reaction to the popularity of ""Eats, Shoots & Leaves"" and that they were merely trying to make a quick buck.Brandon Simpson"
3,Not exactly what I was looking for...,"This is not bad for a book that shows you what you can do with actionscript. But if you want to know the ins and outs of actionscript like I did, this is not the book you are looking for. I recently purchased another book --AS definitive guide-- which really gave me a full understanding on the subject; this book seems to merely brush on the subject in comparison."
1,You Have Got To Be Kidding!,"I like weird movies, I like bad movies. But I do not like TERRIBLE movies, and that is what you have here.The plot if there is one sounds like it was made up while two guys were in a druken stuper. The acting is terrible, and there is NO entertainment value what so ever. Can we give it a minus 1?"
4,"devoid of dvd extras, but worthwhile viewing nonetheless","Written by Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich), this film about a love rectangle is as quirky and insightful as one would hope. With Patricia Arquette as a circus freak/nature writer, Tim Robbins as a researcher scarred by his childhood, Rhys Ifans as a young man raised as an ape, and Miranda Otto as a French lab assistant with a secret, this is a well-acted well-paced oddity that nevertheless makes consistently interesting observations about human nature. If you enjoyed other films written by Kaufman, you will most likely enjoy this film, which is a bit quirkier but less bizarre than Malkovich.DVD extras are: a trailer -- that's it! The film can be heard in English or French with optional English subtitles. Another worthwhile movie from the mind of Kaufman."
1,The Worst Movie,"If there was a 0 star for a reating this movie would get it would get it. This movie is stupider than Kung Pow. This stupid movie isn't worth your time. You could easily just like watch any other movie for less price for this one.You won't even want to get this one for your collection. The people run around naked and there is way to much sex for a so called VIRGIN that is 32 years old. Ain't that sad. The man is a table manners freak and the chick is nuts. She instist on thinking she is a beast or animal and the other beast animal thing is crazy and to interested in woman even though he seeing his teacher and assistant having sex all the time when his teacher already has a girlfriend. Please take my advice and don't buy this movie it's a waist of money. If you have to see it rent it, not buy it."
1,A Total Waste of a Dead Tree.,"I don't normally bother reviewing books I think are bad, but this one is SO bad I must say a few words, knowing it will earn me negative votes. I DON'T NEED TO HAVE CHILDREN, I DATE THEM is not just not funny -- it is offensive and vulgar. One wouldn't mind the vulgarity, I suppose, if there had been one laugh in the entire book. But no. This is the author of a book on training your man as you would a dog, so why would I be surprised when she suggests training him as you would a toddler? I bought it as a funny gift but started reading it and refused to give it to my friend, out of embarrassment. Save your money."
1,A worthless book,"This is yet another book chock full of anti-male prejudice from Karen Salmansohn. Please people,I cant emphasize this enough,do not buy this womans books unless you support childish sexism toward men.These books arent even good enough for novelty items.Please,have more respect for yourself,dont insult yourself by reading books like these.You wont find any useful information or inspiration in Karens books,only sexism."
4,Outstanding,I wasn't aware that Makaha Sons was the music of Iz until a lady in a small shop in Kauai told me about it. I'm so glad she did because I love this CD. It is so relaxing and soothing. My only complaint is that it doesn't have more solos by Izzie because his voice is perfect. May he rest in peace and know how many Mainlanders love him.
2,A lot of misunderstandings spoil this book.,"The book is spoiled because it does not understand the Catholic teaching on justification which it is trying to rebut. Robert Sungenis' work ""Not by Faith Alone"" should be read alongside for comparison. Then let the reader decide.The essay structure of the book is never a good idea, as it leads to overlap."
2,Ok for a while,"I got these while I was restoring an old Schwinn since they looked almost identical to it's old busted pedals. They worked well for about 8 months, but with all the time it spends outside, and the exposed bearings, they've become problematic. One side has developed a very strong click as it goes around and greasing it and more can only get it to go away briefly. From the way it's off it's axis when I spin it, it obviously has something trapped in it that's causing it issues now, or some similar problem, but there is no apparent way to take them apart and fix that, so now I'm stuck buying another pair of pedals."
4,Holds the curls but takes time to figure out.,I have used this products only a few times because it takes some practice to figure out how to roll the hair without getting creases in your hair. It seems look fine when it's rolled until I take the rollers out and there are lines in my hair where the cover has left a crease. The curl is extreme so figuring out which sizes work for the look you are after takes a few tries. I like loose curls so I used the largest rollers all over my head. I had to purchase an extra set of rollers because the kit doesn't come with very many. With practice you can get some amazing curls!
3,steam rollers,I like the Caruso steam hair setter but wish the rollers would last longer or could just replace the foam around the rollers without having to buy the whole roller. the price for the rollers is expensive since they don't last long.
5,Love this hair roller system!,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter, and we both love it. It actually leaves your hair very shiny - no dryness or hair damage. The steam makes great curls, and it's very easy to use. Highly recommend this to anyone!"
5,Buy this album now!,Moscow! Moscow!dsgzchbingis khan is b3st EVAR! They are BEING SO HOT! They make mY LEGS DANCE SO MUCH TIMES.
1,Was Hitler funny?,"This is a very cute glorification of a man that was tyrant and a mass murderer in his time. I'm not impressed with pop cultures glossing over the facts and looking at 3 positive things that he might have done over a lifetime as a mass murderer. Three hundred years from now are they going to write a musical called ""the Ballad of Adolph Hitler""? Same difference."
2,I didn't get much out of this video,"I have watched this video twice and after a month now, should try it again. I didn't find much helpful information to teach kids to pitch in this video."
4,Great book for sensor engineers,"The chapters about sensors and specs in general are great for new engineers to understand what's important in designing sensors. The rest of the chapters give an understanding of many types of sensors. The author's style is to be short and to the point, just what I like. The book is fairly short, and I hope future editions may expand more on some of the deatails."
2,Not very good at all,"These neither smell nor taste anything like grape. I know that grape flavor is usually artificial and that I should not expect much, but really -- there is hardly any flavor but plain sweet in these. Not even the ""bubblegum"" flavor like Bazooka Joe or something. Just straight up sugar.These are also hollow. Each is an empty shell about 1"" in diameter, but a hollow globe with about a 1/8"" wall. Partially because of this, by the time the package got to me, many of the gum ""balls"" were shattered, leaving little shards of gum in the bag.Chewing both the little shards and biting down on each new hollow globe of gum risks cutting the inside your mouth.Just not very good. Unless you actually operate a gumball machine for money, I would recommend sticking with Bubblicious grape or something like that. I know I will from this point on."
2,National lampoons the movie,"I thought that this movie was going to be so funny and a great watch but in fact all it was a bunch of naked parts and sexual behavior. I am a big big fan of the jackass crew and was so excited when I found this. I was very disappointed in what it was about. There were some funny parts that made me laugh but the whole movie is just basically a porn. This is way way more for guys then girls that's for sure. I also wanted to see more of Chris and he has such a small part, that made me sad. I would say rent this movie before you buy it because you may be unhappy with what you get. I am going to just stick with wildboyz and my jackass DVDs."
4,Awesome CD,"The cd is awesome. i love it! The best song on this one has to be, ""Caught in the Sun."" Their first hit. If you like rock, this is a must have CD. I listen to the CD all the time. All the songs are good, my money well spent."
1,Horific,"This has to be, by far, the worst movie I have ever seen. The writing, acting, direction, would embarass a film student's professor. This makes The Onion's movie look professional."
4,"A bit wordy, but with important information","A wordy expose on how humans have impacted their environment for their time on earth with valuable insights on why things went the way they did. For example, Tudge covers the extinction of large mammals in North America by humans (it was a mathematical certainty, he says), the rise of agriculture which lead to our rise in population, and how our agriculture may just be our own doing in. Tudge explores current theories and then comes to his own conclusions which all seem plausible by the book's end. If you want to avoid searching the bookshelves for human ecological and biological histories, this book may sum up what you need to know."
1,Not compatible,It wood not work after trying all there recomendations. Sony only uses Sony and I should know better I own several cameras
3,Okay player for the price.,Just purchased Samsung DVD-P213 to replace my old Samsun DVD which I gave away. It worked mostly on all DVD I have except non US-Canada DVD. So this DVD is not REGION-FREE! Also IT didn't play any VCD I have which is really a bummer. The feature of able to play JPEG and MP3 is pretty nice. Althought the auido output is only coax no Optical!
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!,"How the heck does a movie like this even get made? <===== with cameras and junk! HAHAHAHA!I mean how does a horrible script like this get funding for a movie to be made? <===== sex?! blackmail?!Anyway, moving on!The monster costume looks like a white abominable snowman costume you can purchase for about 80 to 100 dollars from your nearest Party Stuff or Costume store. Why they bothered to show the monster during the daylight hours I'll never know.Please just avoid!"
3,Mildly entertaining and funny,"I had heard that this movie was funny from several friends and also read some reviews about how hilarious this movie is. While there were several hilarious scenes -- Will Ferrell streaking through the streets of town to name one -- the overall laughs were not as many and somewhat trite. Of the three, Ferrell was the funniest followed by Vaughn. I found Luke Wilson's character rather boring and the plot with Ellen Pompeo was all to predictable. If you're looking for light, occassionally funny fare, you could do worse. However, I thought ""Wedding Crasher's"" and ""Talladega Nights"" were far funnier movies."
4,Gets better every time I see it,"I can honestly say I left the theater unhappy after watching this movie. And I don't know exactly why, but I think it's because this was somewhat of a formulaic comedy similar to just about every other comedy out there.But the more I look back on the theater, I think I went into it looking for a ""classic"" comedy, something new and mind blowing, and this isn't that. This is along the lines of Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and even as far down the food chain as say Duece Bigalow or The Ladies Man. (yes, I have targeted SNL Flicks there, but this movie DOES star Will Ferrell). That being said, I think of this movie as having some great lines and or scenes (Shawnn William Scott's small part is one of my favorite parts of the entire movie).If you're looking for some goodhearted, crude, humor, then this is the flick, it's not a ""classic"" (it's not Animal House, as much as it wants to be), but it's well worth a watch or two. If even for just the funniest 10 moments or so."
1,Not worth watching,"My situation is similar some to the others who were told it was funny and I wanted to see this movie. There was nothing funny about it; I could not watch the whole movie. Nothing original, I felt they were taking from Animal House and SNL."
1,NO COMPARISON!!!!,"I cant believe people are comparing this movie to Animal House. Animal House is a comedy classic. This movie is a joke. Its a typical comedy of today.....Stupid! They dont know how to make movies anymore, its pretty sad. I dont even know why I rent movies today. I guess I like ""old school"" movies."
4,I'm here for the gang bang...,"If you're at all like me, Old School is one of those movies you'll crave to watch again and again. It's a hilarious story about a group of guy friends (I think they're in their late 20's or early 30's) who, following a major breakup for one of them, all join forces to create a fraternity of sorts. It's great, great fun with a hilarious Andy Dick teaching the ladies a private class (absolutely hilarious, and although I'm quite sure most people have already seen this movie, I'd hate to spoil it for the one lone freak out there who has yet to see it), the initiation of the pledges, the pledges themselves (You're my boy, Blue!), and my all-time favorite moment is Will Farrell and the dart.This movie never fails to make me laugh or cheer me up. Don't take it too seriously and you'll have fun with it too."
4,I was crying,"I rented this movie with my wife who was hesitant but she liked it too. Overall, I liked this move but one scene at a birthday party made me cry because I was laughing so hard. After the move finished I played back that scene about 15 times and I cried the entire time. The next day before I returned the movie I watched that scene again and again was crying.Definitely check out this movie it is good."
5,Whilin out,"It's a great want to get drunk and hang out with the guys (and I'm a girl)kind of movie. It will just make you laugh and laugh and laugh. And possibly want to relive glory days of college, or just act stupid. It's a toss up really. Great hanging out movie."
5,Super,"Totally awesome. Totally awesome totally awesome totally awesome today is Monday, this is stupid 6 more words left. Almost there..."
1,Not even an oracle,"There's a reason why this book never got a second edition: it's not even an oracle. It's more like an egyptian kit to make customers spend money for nothing. It has a booklet (I can't call that a book), quite superficial although it's full color. The book only contains general information about some very few aspects of egiptian culture. The book itself doesn't correspond to the calendar cards and the oracle figure cards. You would have expected the little book to be some sort of ""manual"" to use the oracle. Well, there's no such a thing, except for the free page, out of the book, with a couple of paragraphs that are suposed to be the ""oracle"" instructions. As for the oracle itself, it's useless. It's simply a collection of cards without any further value (not even artistic)."
2,The Great Crash of 1929,A very detailed and in depth exercise from a academic viewpoint. Many facts covered in fine written form that covers the subject in great length and detail
2,JKG thinks he funny. He's not.,"While I did find the book informative and a good supplement to Robert Sobel's The Great Bull Market: Wall Street in the 1920s, Galbraith interjects his sarcastic view of the participants in the 1920s Bull Market way too much. This makes parts of the book extremely difficult to read. While I persevered to the end, I fouynd Sobel's account as informative and much more enjoyable to read."
2,Loved them at first.,"Loved these at first. We had the 2.0 version and then bought the 3.0 version. I wanted to make sure we had a large enough stash size so I bought 36 in total. Well, within about 6 months of use the velcro on all of them was trashed. We have a front loader and I was using Country Save detergent and followed their directions exactly. I didn't think much about it, but then they started leaking...EVERY.SINGLE.TIME. I called and was given a list of things to try to strip them and they offered to send velcro tabs for me to replace myself, but as a busy mom of 3 I DO NOT have the time to sew. SO...I'm disappointed in their durability overall and after spending time on other diapering forums I see I'm not the only one. I wish I had read more reviews before purchasing.The positives: They are one size and have a good fit."
2,Doesn't hold up over the long term,"I have used the 3.0 with aplex closures for almost 3 yrs, and two babies. The diaper materials and inserts have held up well overall. However, the aplex is a disappointment. I have replaced it twice - once using the Bum Genius replacements and once using a stronger material from the fabric store. My own replacements worked much better. Additionally, replacing the tabs created holes in the stretch fabric to which they attach. So now that part of the diapers is beginning to fail. For the price I very much expected these diapers to be superior performers. I have added to my stash with much less expensive pocket diapers with snaps and they have performed much better. I would caution anyone who is considering investing in these diapers for use with multiple children."
2,Too expensive for the poor quality.,"I own 4 of these diapers which I've been using on my son since he weighed about 11 pounds. He weighs 25 now and they still fit him well. I will not be able to use them on future children until they fit into the largest size setting because the buttons that you use to snap the diaper into a smaller size have all come out of the PUL and retreated into the diaper. I will have to either spend some time fixing all four diapers or just use my FuzziBunz One Size diapers next time. I'm disappointed given the price per diaper. I will not buy or suggest this brand to anyone. FuzziBunz One Size are in perfect shape still which I've used as long as the BGs. Also, the velcro closure on the BG diapers are curling and don't hold very well anymore. Overall, a poorly made diaper that's priced way beyond what it's worth."
4,GREAT!,I love the built in soakers and the fact that I can add extra inserts if needed. Easy to use for everyone including Dad;) Does take awhile to dry though because of the built in soaker/ insert.
2,"Owned macs my entire adult life, this one is the worst","I love macs, and never thought I would be putting one down. I thought I was upgrading when I sold my G4 ibook and bought this. It is primarily a frame for the spinning beach ball that seems to constantly be on the screen (while you wait for the program, page etc. to load). I also was stiffed the [...] rebate form apple - really dissapointing. I can't reccomend PCs, Linux seems too much trouble, so I don't know what I would suggest."
4,Forget you AA!!! Bring on the beer,I was happy with the flavor of beers I received. It was not long after my order that I was brewin my way to a greener liver. Thanks Amazon!!! I Love You!
4,good product,I received this product very quickly. It was a gift so I've not yet tasted the product but based on the reviews from other flavors of this product it is very tasty and easy to make.
1,Bad for Outside Time,"Needed outside/outdoor clock; advertised as such, but NOT. Returned it and a-o-k now, but hassle and disappointmen of it! Product was perfect otherwise. But, merchant & consumer lost due to improper labeling, time wasted for both."
5,It 's the only reason I passed Elementary Statistics,"I had to teach myself statistics the first time around and this book deserves sole credit for my passing grade. Furthermore, I was able to use this book to teach my classmates and everyone passed the course, a first with that professor. I used the book as tutor at more than one school, as well. Highly recommended!"
3,Andrew Jackson,"Good, basic history of the man and the period. Quick read, not great depth. Good read if you want a summary of the man."
1,bull,"okay for people with anxiety, this is total bullchit, do not believe the reviewers its a scam, even if they have others reviews, its on purpose. Or you can buy seredyn and get robbed, the best supplement for anxiety or depression is GABA 750mg, even tough it's better to go to a doctor, maybe get yourself on antidepressants IF NECESSARY. now watch the pissed off marketers comment on my reviews ahah. these people better not mess with my health..."
1,Disappointment,"I have been very disappointed in Serydyn after trying it for several weeks. I have felt no reduction in anxiety, insomnia or stress. I would not recommend this product."
1,Seredyn Does Not Work,"After reading all the testimonals on their website as to how wonderful this product is for anxiety I found it to have absolutely no effect on me. I took the 3 capsules for extreme stress as indicated and nothing. No calming, nothing. I tried it for a few days as directed and still nothing. I should have known because all the testimonals on their website are favorable and you are unable to leave your own feedback, which leads me to believe they are fabricated. Also, within 45-60 mins. of taking it I got severe headaches. I would advise to NOT buy this product based on the placebo effect it had on me and the headaches. I at least was able to get some relief using Kava Kava tea and/or supplements. Yogi Tea puts out a few teas for stress relief and calming that have helped me more for a fraction of the price."
2,Health,I was hopeful this might help my anxiety. It may help others but did nothing for me. I will take now and again or at bedtime just to finish the bottle.
1,Very Disappointed,I do not recommend this product to anyone. Does absolutely nothing. I bought it after reading the reviews but it did not help with the conditions it stated. Very disappointed and out $30; stick with Yogi tea's they work.
1,discusting !,"when i recieved this parcell the contents of it had been opened.the seal had been broken and the cap witch says ""sealed for your protection"" had been broken.i will not use this product because i dont like the idia of some person with dirty hands pawing through my medication.for this reason i will NOT be buying anything from this website again."
3,WAY too expensive for mediocre results,"Pros: There is actual dosing on the side of the bottle. Sometimes natural products are guesswork. There is also a nice mix of ingredients so you don't have to purchase separately.Cons: The price. 60 caps for $30? 50 cents a pill. Dosage recommendations are 1-3 capsules ""as needed"" up to 3 times a day. So $4.50 a day? This would be worth it if they actually worked well. Taking 3 pills gives a mild relaxation.The verdict: The main ingredient in this is niacinamide, which is BEYOND cheap to purchase. I already have and use a bottle of that in combination with GABA, which is also very, very cheap. GABA gives you more of a tranquilizer feeling and helps you sleep, along with varying other benefits per user. Niacinamide + GABA = great night's sleep and better mental health for less than but no more than $1 a week. Seredyn would have you going through a bottle a week looking for relief."
1,Meh...,"Did nothing for me, all it did was maybe give me some energy..I was very disappointed in this product.You would think buying things and they would..work...nope"
5,Calming,"I've lived with anxiety since for over ten years and sometimes have horrible fits that leave me completely immobile, my muscles seize up, my heart pounds, my stomach completely knots up, and I barely sleep. My mom (who never used to be into herbal stuff) recommended this to me as a starting point. I was completely panicked one morning and took three Seredyn. In much less than an hour, my muscles untensed, and I was able to feel hungry as my stomach relaxed and tired as I came down from my panic. I was able to laugh, talk, and eat again and work through the problem instead of feeling like my body was seized up.This may not work the same way for other people, but my experience proved to me that this is an extremely effective remedy for me."
3,LITTLE MAN,"I just got done watching this, I liked it! Its about a 7 year old who is a genius and his mom and he must decide weather or not he should go to college at his young age. Its really good!"
5,Need To Cry...?,This touching story never fails to bring me to tears when Fred reads his Clipper Ship Poem near the end.This is a MUST OWN for the Emotionally Challenged! Need A Good Cry? Watch this film tonight!!!
2,A Dumb Movie About A Young Genius,"Jodie Foster directed this movie - a child prodigy's search for social acceptance. Fred Tate is a precocious fourth grader who has no problem with the most complex mathematical problems or in banging out a Rachmaninoff concerto on the piano, but is totally inept at playing baseball or dealing with children his own age. His mother Dede is a cocktail waitress who cares passionately about her son. Fred comes to the attention of child psychologist Jane Grierson who runs a summer camp for child prodigies called Odyssey of the Mind. She invites Fred to attend the summer session, creating a rift between Fred and Dede. Fred decides he's not interested in genius things like attending a university class, and would rather play pool and have friends. The movie is a poor waste of nearly two hours."
2,No bottle caps,"I had very good luck with Mr. Beer and wanted a second keg and bottle caps so I can make more. No bottle caps were included despite what the description/photo promise. So if you're like me and threw out bottle caps, don't buy this kit to get more."
5,One of the best seasons,This is one of the best seasons of the series of 21 Jump Street.It had very moving storylines - such as Doug and Martya (who was sent back to El Salvador and disappeared) to Judy being made detective and then raped. Ioki also had to deal with coming out of the coma and Tom - he was just the same as always.This is also one of my favourite seasons as it is the last one before a couple of episodes in the next that Tom leaves the series unexplained.I have already sat down and had a marathon to watch it all and I just can't get enough of it - if only TV shows were still as great as this! Go and buy it!!!
4,Cool Cop Show,"I watched the show growing up and loved it. The different characters and story were great. Funny and creative!!! Really good action, and stories that came back in later episodes. Cool show to watch!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Beware: Made in China,It was not specified on this site and I did not know until I received the product. This is something that should be clear on the product page especially since the FDA has specifically warned about chicken jerky products for pets that are made in China. I am going to ask for a refund.
1,Terrible!!!,"The author of this book took a bad idea and wrote an even worse book. read at your own risk. The characters are disagreeable, and the writing is disgustingly simplistic.I have the feeling the author wrote this book for all the wrong reasons. Unfortunately, this was recommended to me by a friend. I hope to spare you do not buy or read this book."
2,Adds Nothing to Revelation Space,"Diamond Dogs is basically a short story about a video game, isn't it? Think DOOM the Movie as a novella. A couple of fascinating themes to be sure, some of the science is truly thought provoking.As for Turquoise, it has been a week since I read it and can't remember much of any of it. Very little substance.I very much like Reynolds' work, but wish I had stuck to my ""no novellas"" rule."
3,I guess we're in the 13th hour,Oppenheimer owes us an updated version of his book explaining why 1992 in fact was not Castro's final hour. The economy has recovered at a rate of around 6% a year since the early nineties. I think Oppenheimer's title betrays a hell of a lot of journalistic hubris.
5,"Fast, Darned Fast","I am used to faster network printers in the 30ppm range (which makes home printers seem slow). Then, this thing spits out at 45ppm. It seems like ours does 60ppm because it prints a page per second (maybe because they are not full pages of text). Wow. Of course, the expected HP quality and reliability."
2,Hard And Broken Gumball Eyes,I received the order promptly and several of the eyes were broken. They were very hard and brittle. The taste of the gum was OK but it was plain to see that these were very old. I would not purchase again.
3,What is it with the Glasgow police?,"Like all of Mina's books ""Deception"" is a more-than-ordinarily well-written puzzler, which is generally all I require from a mystery. But this one had a logical inconsistency that bugged me the whole way through. Susie Harriot has been convicted of an enormously high-profile murder, yet all her papers, books and records appear to have been left untouched--her computer files unsearched--by the police. The material her husband Lachlan sorts through in her private office would most certainly have been confiscated and much of it brought up at trial. In all her books Mina demonstrates considerable mistrust of the police, who tend to be lazy, incompetent, bullies, or ""bent."" But surely the Glasgow prosecuctor's office wouldn't have ignored a treasure trove of evidence like this. It's possible Mina explains this somewhere in the book--if so I missed it. If not, in my mind the whole story falls apart."
2,What did I miss?,"I liked this novel a great deal at the beginning - interesting premise and well-drawn characterizations through the eyes of the narrator. By the middle of this book, I was starting to daydream through the same repetitive passages that I had already read and by the end I was skimming to finish it. However, I found at the end that I had not been patient enough -the pivotal conclusion was finished in several ""meaty"" pages. I am left wondering if the author got a call from the publisher asking for a quick end, so Denise Mina finished it immediately. By then, I think we had all tired of the seemingly endless navel gazing and preening self-importance of the main character, so perhaps it's just as well that it ended when and how it did. In my opinion, this book is not a ""keeper."""
2,disappointing suspense novel,"I was surprised that this novel received such positive acclaim as I found it to be frustrating and disappointing. I probably would not have finished reading it except that it came so highly rated that I wanted to find out if I was missing something. I found the narrator to be insipid, whiney and annoying, and could barely tolerate his level of denial and pathological dependency upon a woman who clearly had no attachment to him. I think the idea of allowing the reader to see things that the narrator is unable to perceive (e.g. that Susie is not the ""innocent"" that she claims) is a good technique, but it was overused, and I found myself feeling like I was watching a bad suspense flick where the audience cannot believe the stupidity of the characters. I love a good psychological suspense novel, but this one did not measure up."
2,Boring,"This is the first book that I read by Denise Mina and I wasn't impressed. The plot was interesting but the story was dragged out and boring. I do have to admit that the ending was a surprise. Luckily, I bought this as a bargain book so I don't feel so bad about putting it in the donation pile."
1,should be a zero number of stars,"I can't believe that there were no bad reviews available. This was the worst book I have ever read. No suspense, No plot, Poor writing and bad sex. I'm glad I took it out from the Library and didn't spend money on it. I waisted my time and it took a long time to read, since I looked for other reasons not to sit down and read. But the good news is I did get all my Christmas shopping done, my house is clean and my bills are paid and I didn't owe a late fee to the Library. I did finially finish, but wish I had taken it back before the last page. What a complete waste of time."
3,Not as good as I remembered,"Here's an overview: Four magicians and a Greek soldier combine forces to find new sources of mana. Mana is what allows magicians to perform magic but it is a resource in limited supply and magicians in the past have squandered the supply away. They use the last bit of mana they can find to travel to northern Europe to find the last living god and steal its mana.I read this book a number of years ago when I was younger. I decided to read it again because my memory of it was good. I can't say the book was bad, but it wasn't great. There were some interesting ideas about magic and the scene of travelling on a cloud still gets me excited (it sounds like fun). If you're into fantasy and magic this book is for you. It's a quick read and the version I have has fantasy drawings on almost every other page. It's almost like a fantasy comic book."
2,The magic indeed went away,"There's a short story by Niven called ""Not Long Before the End"", to which this book is a kind of a sequel and which, I think, won a Hugo. I guess Niven thought his idea was just too good to squander on a single short story. Possibly: but it was a good short story, and this is a flabby book. A collection of short stories might have been preferable."
5,Quality set,Bought this as a gift almost 10 years ago for my sister and brother in law. They still use them daily and they still look and work beautifully. Lovely set.
1,After 3 months low battery alarm won't stop - even with brand new batteries,"I purchased this to replace an identical model that was beeping with a low battery alarm (and would not stop even after replacing with brand-new alkaline and expensive lithium batteries). The new unit worked for about three months until it started beeping as well. Changing the battery with multiple alternate batteries did not resolve - again lithium or alkaline. For both detectors I tested them hard wired and also without and it didn't make a difference. I'm giving the lowest rating because the first unit was purchased at a local store, and the second unit from Amazon so the chances they're from the same potentially bad ""batch"" is very low. No-one can tolerate the obnoxious and continuous low-battery alarm beep so the unit is effectively junk.I replaced it with a First Alert unit that's working fine."
4,Works fine,NOTE - these last exactly 7 years - then they begin to beep and you have to replace the entire unit. It is a legal safety factor built into the device - as the max service life is 10 years (why they don't start beeping after 9 years is beyond me!).Product was real easy to install in the old brackets.
1,WAY too sensitive!,"I purchased 4 of these to put into a home I purchased in May, 2011. I can't even cook in my house! The least bit of smoke from a pan will set this thing off (and all of the others connected), while the air itself isn't smokey at all. So annoying. I find myself in a new hotel this morning and turn on the heater and I hear the familiar beep and ""FIRE! FIRE!"" and look up and there it is. The same model I have. As soon as I get home I'm replacing these pieces of junk."
2,Battery Intolerance,"My unit was incredibly sensitive to the battery used, even among the major brands and within the same brand. With each rejection I checked the battery voltage. All rejected batteries were close to 9v and most were above. I found one rechargeable that worked but only for several months.WARNING: When working with the unit or testing wear ear protection!!! It sounds off at full volume unexpectedly.Another negative is that as stated on the unit, it may take up to 15 minutes to respond.On the plus side the voice description of the alarm is nice."
3,7 years working life is too short,It is what I want to replace my old one. I have to replace it every 7 years. That will produce lots of electronic garbage. Bad for our environment.
4,ok but,"i bought these to replace the originals in my homethey were 10 years old and had thrown a few false alarmsi bought the same brand hoping the plugs would match, but they did notthe originals had 3 pins in a straight linethe new ones had 3 pins in a staggered lineso i had to rewire, not that big of a deal i guessmy only real complaint is the green light is too brightit lights the whole bedroom and the whole hallcertainly not enough to read from, but it is no longer pitch black in the house at nighthope this is helpful"
5,fire/carbon detector,"The fire/carbon detector works, wonderfully. We love the fact that when it does go off, there's a voice message. We highly recommend this product."
2,Not bad,"I got this without a mounting hardware. It was missing.....it looks like an open item. Otherwise, it's ok.Please, Make sure you have everything after you receive the packege."
1,If I could hear it....,"If I could hear it I'd probably like it, but the sound it just SO bad, SO muddly it's impossible to enjoy. A waste of money."
3,Vocabulary is not so simple,The Jungle Book in English is not simply a kids' book. The words used can be complex and it is not always clear who is speaking. I am finding this book a challenge and I am not a beginner at speaking Spanish. I would not describe this as simple vocabulary. I am enjoying it but don't expect an easy read!
5,the classic love songs phil perry,"I love phil perry even more! everyone who has heard this cd has asked ""who is that"""
2,Not for swimming,"We've had this vest for more than a year now. The kids don't like it. I don't either. It's very bulky, and rides up on them because it doesn't have the strap that others have. I'd love to have it if my kid fell off a boat, but it's really not designed well for kids learning to swim."
1,"Pap, crap","If you are a true bibliophile, this is not for you. You may find it offensive -- not insulting, just offensive to your intelligence and good taste. It's cover to cover low brow nonsense, low quality frivolity. I'm ""donating"" my copy to a used book store. I'd discard it outright, but I think that even our trashman reads better stuff than this. Thank the publisher that he saw fit not to put it out in hardcover."
5,A great ride,A unique and interesting trip into the world of an immigrant trying to make it in the US. A very touching story about those around him that touch his life.
2,this movie is okay,i thought this movie was better.kuno becker plays an immigrant. the guy didnt even learn english. or accomplished anything. estaba aburrida esta pelicula
3,Very nice special effects. Serviceable acting. Very poor writing.,"*SPOILER ALERT*The plot (so far) has gaping credibility holes. I can accept the ""portal to another timeline"" idea, despite that they never even attempt to explain what mechanism is doing that.But we're supposed to believe that the main character escaped from prison, hi-jacked his way into another reality, with a stow-away extra kid and then not only is everybody totally okay with it, but the guy becomes the new sheriff there? UM, WHAT?The military commander there killed his own commanding officer in order to maintain HIS OWN true vision of the place. And he's still in charge. And the government back home is not only not asking questions (apparently), but keep sending new folks through the portal. UM, WHAT?Even without that, there's just way too much family drama and teenage romance here.It's possible they will improve, but I don't see this one pulling out of the nose dive it's currently in."
2,Could be worse . . .,"I enjoy scifi TV. So when I saw Spielberg was involved in this I was hoping for something with at least a little pizzazz. I was wrong. It's got nice CGI with the dinosaurs and all, but that's about it. Story line seems dumbed down for the kids, which is the last thing you want to do with a good children's show. Plotlines are utterly predictable. Dialogue--less said about it the better.I watched the first few episodes on the real TV and then gave up on it. I'd feel really ripped off if I'd paid actual money for each show."
4,Fun show,"Nice mix of Avatar, Jurrasic Park and Mad Max. Show seems like its got good potential. The first few episodes deliver more of a plot than the series ""Lost"" seemed to muster in 4 seasons. Like the adventure, and the characters seem interesting. Hope the suits give it a chance."
1,Waste of money,"I don't think I would have watched this even for free. Some times story writers, directors etc think the viewers are stupid and they can do anything with the plot. I did not watch it completely even I paid for it."
1,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to this,dinosaurs,time travel,sounded great but even after 7 episodes i cant watch anymore,its cheesy,the characters are awful,storylines are drab & the acting is bad,even the dinosaurs cant save this.kids will probably love it but from an adult who grew up on the x files this just dont cut it."
4,Land of the Lost Meets Jurasic Park,"I enjoy Tera Nova. It's a bit predictable however, it has that sci-fi element I love. I hope FOX keeps the show running and doesn't kill it like so many other sci-fi shows they have killed (i.e. Firefly)."
4,From Abingdon Press:,"Help youth find true meaning in the Christmas season! Through these exciting programs and meaningful practices, youth will meet Jesus in a personal way. Each program has a related practice, which gives youth the opportunity to experience various traditions and celebrations related to the season. In addition, readers will find a photocopiable weekly newsletter with devotional and bible study materials and journaling exercises to encourage youth in their spiritual life and in their attendance. Use all programs and practices or pick and choose to fit specific needs."
1,Buyer Beware.,"I don't recommend this product. I've tried this twice and I get very extreme stomach pains to the point I thought I was going to faint. I can deal with pain fairly well and this has to be the worst pain I've ever experienced. I go to the bathroom with a stomach ache and it starts hurting extremely bad when I have to ""let it out"". The pain hurts even more when I can't let it out which almost caused me to faint. It eventually worked, but the pain is not worth it from this product.I highly suggest Miralax. It helps you go the same day you take it and it doesn't hurt your stomach at all. You feel like you could just go naturally. That's how well that product is."
1,A pitiful excuse for a ballad !,"Please don't waste your money if you are a Dale fan; you'll be very disappointed. The ""music"" is the pits and the lyrics to this so called ballad could have been written by a second grader! Sorry but..from the sub-title I expected some quality and dignity and it just isn't there. If anyone wants my CD--the first one that e-mails me to ask for it can have it without any charge; and I'll even pay the postage!"
5,Sleep in the breeze,"OK, I actually bought this fan last year for a july camping trip and did'nt come back to write a recomendation. Now just back from camping in RI and there was a heat wave, I got home to a bad storm and power outage lasting 12 hours! This fan has been worth its weight in gold! I slept good both hot nights with the fan on low blowing across me. Battery life is good too! Now my Mother wants one for her next power outage. Thanks O2 cool!! Bob- Mahopac, NY"
1,Piece of Junk,I received this fan and folded out the base which is hinged. Both hinges immediately broke. I complained and Ace sent me another fan. They generously told me I could keep the 1st broken fan. I just received the fan. I very carefully folded out the base. Both hinges broke again. I guess I will cobble together something to attach the fan to the base but basically this fan is a piece of junk.
2,"Good, but needs more that just the music. . .","I bought this cd for the Piazzolla piece, and was dissappointed that the performers merely played what was on the page, and did nothing more to ""feel"" the music or make it exceptional in any way. The rest of the pieces are similarly dry."
1,Mislead Completely!,"Expecting a collection of faux pas-foot-in-the-mouth gems, this calendar is really just a silly collection of newspaper typos....it's international in it's breadth yet mostly irritating garbage nobody really cares about. I should have spent my money ona worthy cause instead of typographical error research!"
1,stupidest calendar ever made,"I'm very disappointed in the editors of this calendar. There are many things in this calendar that shouldn't even be considered stupid. For example, a good portion of the calendar is newspaper headline type-o's. These don't count as stupid - they're mistakes. Also, quotes from instruction manuals don't count, just because the editors don't understand the reason for the instructions given. I realize labeling something the ""stupidest thing ever said"" is an objective opinion, but I think many of the things said in this calendar wouldn't get voted as stupid by the general population. You'd think between celebrities and politicians... 365 stupid quotes would be a piece of cake to come up with in the course of a calendar year."
4,Kitties are cute,My son is 17 months old and loves cats. Kitten party is a great way for him to get his daily fix.
4,Great Knives,"These are great knives. They look great, and cut just as good. The glass block in wonderful. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars, was that the scissors advertised are not the ones that come with the set. The scissors you get are nice stong sissors, but the product description and picture describe them as having griping teeth, and a notch for bottle opening, they have neither. But this is still a great deal on a great set on knives."
4,"OK product, but the diameter is a bit off","These foam applicators do not fit exactly on the microdermabrasion rotary tool, but they can be forced on with a little pressure."
5,Greatest Vocalist Since Ella,"I have long been a Manhatten Transfer and Janis Siegel fan. I have all of Janis's solo releases. This one really gets your attention fast and holds it all the way through. Janis has vocal abilities that far outclass the list of vocalist around today. I would put her in the same class as Ella. When she swings you want to get up and dance, when the torch is lit you want to cry in your drink, and when it's a love song tell your partner to hold on tight. What can I say she is great."
4,Destine to Witness:Growing Up Black in Nazi Germany,"I found this to be a very interesting record of Hans Massaquoit's growth and development in Nazi Germany. I learned quite a bit from this reading, for example, I was not familiar with the hundreds of adolescent youth sterilized because of their mixed parentage. The well written book is an easy read, but not easy to put down. What I found interesting was the individual racism Hans experienced in Germany was no worse than the wholesale racism many Afro-Americans experience in America."
4,stay within the design limits,"I used this to seal the entire length of the vertical joints on an old Franklin Stove. Worked great except for those areas right on the firebox. Here, after a week of fires, the silicone dried up and fell out. In fairness, this area does exceed the manufacturer's spec. of 500 degree F. Just inches away from the firebox, and for the rest of the run, the seal remains strong, pliable and above all, sealed.Highly recommended, if you do not exceed the design..."
4,I'm glad I found Return in Red - I really enjoyed it.,"I originally watched this via Netflix figuring it was just gonna be another B-movie, but I was happily surprised to find a very enjoyable film. These guys were actually trying to make a good movie and I think they did great job with what they had.I'm not usually a fan of slow pacing, but it works in this film by allowing enough time to establish the setting and what is normal. Because of this, the strangeness that comes later has greater impact.Most horror movies today are terribly predictable, but this one has some truly unexpected turns and one scene in particular creeped me the heck out. Authentic rural characters and location. Excellent at developing mood.Yes, I bought the DVD :)"
1,Worst movie ever,"Worst directed, worst acting, worst editing. The film moves so slow watching it was torture. No character development. This should have been a 20 minute short film if that. A HUGE waste of time."
1,absolutely terrible,after using this product two or three times it broke. a total waste of time. you neet to make sure you treat it like fine china or else it will break. complete garbage!
1,An unfortunate flaw.,"This product has a flaw that, unfortunately, has compromised the integrity of my Sony Ericcson 810i mobile phone. I ordered two of them for two family members. The first time I used the first one, just 5 days ago, when I went to remove it, two clips disassociated from the charger and remained in the charging port of the phone. These are very fragile plastic clips. I had no choice but to push the charger back onto them in the hope that they would click into place on the charger itself and be able to be disengaged from the phone. This has happened only with one of the clips. This means that I cannot use the house charger or the music earphones with my phone. Further, I have to remain with this car charger attached to avoid having that single unmoving clip break off in the phone port, thereby disabling the phone seriously. I have reported this problem to Sony Ericcson by email. The other charger has remained unopened until I sort this out."
1,Sony ericsson cigarette lighter,The charger doesnt work the little light on it does but upon inserting it on a sony ericsson phone the phone reads it but does not charge. I tried it on several cars and phones same response.
4,Good function - little fragile clip for map light.,"Pros: The charger works well. It allows you to plug in (piggy back) the phone's wired headset and ear phones while charging takes place. There is even a built in LED map light.Cons: There is (was) a built in clip on the side so you can clip the map light to something. It broke off before I could even try it. The broken clip did not degrade the function of the charger, which is why I purchased the device.Overall a good charger for the money."
4,Great Recipes,"The book was in great condition. Found many wonderful recipes, but less than 10% of the recipes interested me. A little time consuming, but worth the time -if you have it!"
5,allergies,"Very good book on health- my brilliant primary M.D. recommended it.Following this author's diet I lost weight and my stomach is feeling much better.It takes time to get rid of allergies, but I am on the right path."
3,A rival to the Dalai Lama,"I had never even heard of the 17th Karmapa until I spied this book on a shelf in Darmsala, India. I am fascinated with the Tibetan culture, and found the book very interesting. The writing style is not the best, but this book unlocks a whole new saga about Tibetan leadership. The young Karmapa is a very fascinating character, and his historical reincarnation background challenges the Dalai Lama for the religious throne of Tibet. Overall, I enjoyed the book, and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in Tibetan culture. Dancing on the Edge of an Endangered Planet"
1,waste of 600 pages,I was required to read this book for school. It was probably the slowest book I have ever read. Don't waste your time. The only reason I gave it one star was that I don't have the option of giving it less.
1,wow did someone ever pay money to be thsi bored?,"Only if you think life is boring drudgery would you ever like this hellish book. IT follows 2 characters who seem to ove pain. This book is designed for people who feel sorry for themselves or are wallowing in thier own narcoleptic rigidity. As said by the reviewer below they basically move from place to place in the greatest country ever, the usa, and are pissey and depressed almost all the time. Astounding that thsi drivel is considered literature."
5,"Different than I thought, in a good way","Wallace Stegner began his book Angle of Repose very slowly. At first I was disgusted by, and sorry for, the old historian. But then I was enthralled by his family's history. As I grew to enjoy that part of the story, I also expanded to enjoy the old, handicapped man's version of life.Angle of Repose was different than I had originally imagined, but it was different in a 'better than I expected' kind of way. I chose this novel for a book report book from a list of Chronicle recommendations, and I think I will go back to the list. This occupied their number one spot, hopefully others will live up to the standard this book set."
3,Gender and Race References a Distraction,"I agree with many of the fine reviews this book has received. In many ways this is one of the most truthful and wonderful novels I've read in a very long time. But I have to say, it is hard to take sometimes, because the narrator is so cranky. And it is hard to identify with and entirely trust a narrator and an author that are wedded to racial epithets. (""An afro in the woodpile"" for example, among at least two others). And toward the end, the misogyny gets a bit out of hand. Hey, that's just the way it is! The point here is not to trash this novel and Stegner-- this novel is magnificent in many ways. But I got angry several times."
2,Not happy with this order.,"I am not happy with this order and will not order from them again. I ordered this book on the 5th and did not receive it in my PO Box until the 16th. Way too long to receive a small book. The book was in poor condition, not what I ordered. I ordered a book that stated at the time of order that it was in good condition. This is not acceptable."
2,Angle of Repose,"I bought this book for a bookclub I belong to and while it was well written, I can't say that I enjoyed the book. I did not care for the characters involved nor their story.I will not recommend the book to friends. This was a case of reading something because of bookclub obligations but having to struggle to finish it.David"
2,nearly intolerable,"highly recommended by intellectuals everywhere...not so much of interest for me...i found Susan Burling Ward a totally unlikable snobish character that i felt no sympathy for or interest in from the very beginning...i had the worst time getting into the story...and after making it half way through the book, found that neither my husband nor my mother-in-law had gotten past the half way mark before being bored to tears...as a matter of fact that was the only reason i finished the book in the first place...to tell them how it ended...and obviously to prove i have more time to waste on books i think are terrible"
5,Best book I've read this decade,"As with all of the (rare)great things I've read or seen, once i finished Angle of Repose, I wished I had never read it so that I could read it again. I usually am bored by history but Stegner lured me into knowing about the development of the American West by writing about people who I cared about, related to. Love, lust, forgiveness presented through three generations were, as subjective as those emotions are, presented almost as historical facts which the reader could look at, weigh and, with the help of this brilliant writer, see as the same deeply important choice for each generation. I liked the story when I began, started turning down invitations as I read further, and by the end (the last sentence especially) needed to see the conclusions that these people as instruction for my own life. This is an incredibly well-written, profound masterpiece."
5,Works Perfectly,The cable works just like the original. There are no problems with it at all. It transfers data very well.
2,Came out of the EU,This order took almost 4 weeks to get to my house. The sender was out of England and didn't have the dvd in stock. When it final got here I opened it up and the back of the dvd was scrached all over. Not impressive
5,Best comedy ever!,This is a super funny movie and it arrived in no time at all! We have loved this movie for years!
3,It's Good!,"Robin Hood Men In Tights is definitely not as good as the older classic movies of Mel Brooks like Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie and High Anxiety and I also enjoyed Spaceballs more then this movie but it is good and Robin Hood Men in Tights is better then Robin Hood Prince of Thieves and I agree that Cary Elwes accent is way better then Kevin Costner's and this movie should be put on DVD."
2,Could not use it.,Took over a month to get here and when I got it I could not use it because it wasn't for my region. So after paying for it and waiting so long in the end I couldn't even use it!!
1,Unh?,This move does not represent the classic Mel Brooks at his best... actually was unable too watch the whole movie... Could have spent my money elsewhere...
4,On time,The move was ordered for my nephew for Christmas. Was worried about it here on time being a couple days before Christmas.Was very pleased it was here on time. The movie played well.
5,Mel Brook's Best Yet,"As a die-hard Brooks fan, I can't see why this doesn't get the appreciation it deserves. Hilariously funny from scene one, the movie out-laughs even classic ""Blazing Saddles"". Brooks spoofs everything with no shame. You can't lose buying this one!"
4,Robin Hood-Men In Tights,"I loved this movie growing up,it seemed alot funnier then and still holds up now.Many 90's references,Richard Lewis*Zima Guy not that funny*, Tracy Ullman(what happen to her?) and a young Dave Chappelle.And of Course the Guy from Hot Shots!(elwes)."
5,Great movie,This is a great movie and the only place I could find it was on Amazon. Thank you for the quick mailing time.
3,"""In the Company of Strangers"" Book by Mary Meigs","I own the movie which was titled ""Strangers in Good Company"", and loved it so much, I musthave watched it a hundred times--it's a poignant, charming film. I've always wondered how itcame to be--how it was filmed--so when I saw the book by Mary Meigs who was in the movie,I ordered it.She writes beautifully, and I came away with all the details of how such a movie came to be--but I won't be able to watch it again without knowing that hidden nearby all that beauty andthose wonderful women, there are cameras, tents, wires, and dozens of people. In short--thereality of it burst my bubble. My fault--not Mary Meigs'."
4,Wonderful,"May Susan King never run out of ideas for books, nor words to describe what her imagination creates. She is the best author I have ever found. My number 1 favorite. Where I did not think it measured up to Laird of the Wind or Angel Knight, it was very, very good and well worth taking a vacation day to read it. With Susan King, if I had only $25 to my name and her next book came out in hardback for $22 I would buy her hardback and worry later about food. In my mind, noone can top her."
2,Be prepared to sharpen,These knives are a nice light-weight stainless steel and great to look at but that's where the accolades end. I could not believe how dull the blades were. I had a hard time slicing through just about anything. I should have realized there was a good reason for the bargain price. It's amazing what these manufacturers can get away with. I also cannot believe all the good reviews I read here. Do these people realize that knives are usually used to cut something?
3,"Good value, but very dull...","The title pretty much sums it up. These are great-looking and great-feeling knives. The copper handles are really nice looking, and the knives are weighted really well. The set was so dull, though, that I had to spend about 45 minutes sharpening them before I could use them."
5,Quality,"I am so glad I bought this particular basket. It was half the price of some of those I found online. I was surprised at the quality of this basket once I recieved it. The covering on the handles, the reinforcing along the bottom, the waterproof (on the bottom) washable liner.... I have reccomended this to friends already. My baby is sleeping in it as I type this review."
5,ROYALTY?,"NOW I SEE WHY SHE IS REFERRED TO AS QUEEN OCTAVIA HARRIS ON MYSPACE, I CHECKED HER OUT ON SOUNDCLICK, TOO...THA GIRL IS SIMPLY ALL THAT. ROCK OR DIE. PERIOD. POSITIVELY 'DANGA'-ROUS!"
1,Master of Physics,"This book is obnoxiously bad. If you prepare for the SATII with this book, you are guaranteed to fail"
4,"Awesome, but...","These DVDs are awesome, but whoever wrote the descriptions on the back must have never watched them. I mean, it's like they are being deliberately unclear. You literally can't tell whats one the DVDs until you put them in and then play them. Kind of frustrating. Terrible marketing and product copy for such great films..."
2,What about the cameramen ???!!!!,"Okay, not a bad documentary about the history of the NFL Film crew, but not that great either. I mean, they talk about the music (which is excellent) and they talk to the editor (who is obviously talented) but what about the cameramen??!!! It's those talented group of cinematographers who framed all of this tight, dramatic action through a flickering viewfinder ! I mean how demanding of a job - shooting in adverse weather, making magazine changes, implementing camera techniques, knowing the game inside and out - anticipating plays and action - follow focusing ! I didn't see anything in the first volume in the documentary about these talented lensmen! What an oversight! Anyhow, it's a pretty decent package - but it's like leaving the engine out of a vehicle !"
4,Pretty good,"This book started off great. Poor Elinor gets forced into marriage by her jerk father just so that he can pay his gambling debts. It is presumed her aged husband will croak soon, but unfortunately, he lives for years and years. You feel sooo bad for this girl. She has to endure so much nonsense from her disgusting husband for the trophe he wants her to be. So many guys in the book fall for her. The only flaw in the book is that it took sooooooo long for the main hero and heroine to get together. It didn't exactly bore you - there was lots going on in virtually every chapter - but just when you thought your patience is about to be rewarded, something else happens. Pretty good overall, though."
2,What else ya got?,"Better than the efforts of Ryan Adams/Whiskeytown? What was this professional reviewer on? This CD isn't quite a dud, but definitely close. Try to find it in the ""used CD"" bins. That's probably where mine will end up."
4,Very educational with a clean line of history.,"This book offers an excellent detailed and informative historical perspective of Denali itself, as well as stories of expeditions, climbers, and a look to the future of the mountain. While well-written and an easy read, some of the stories lack the drama and realism due to the continuing third-person perspective. The book is more of a ""factbook"" rather than a collection of gripping adventures, and I recommend this read for those interested in true learning about the mountain. The reader is left with a greater appreciation of both nature and human perseverance."
3,B&D T4250 Toast-It-All 4-Slice Toaster..black,"Ok, Here's the Scoop..This Toaster Is Inexpensive. Toast's Bread & Bagels good. Easy to clean out bottom panel. But, the Handles break off after a few weeks so you get to push down on the metal arms that the handles were attached to! Or if your creative you can fashion some new handles out of wood. You don't get much for 20 Bucks these days. Have fun."
4,What a Dream!,"I was so excited to find the complete soundtrack! I have the original, but was disappointed to find it didn't have the full version of the show...I absolutely love it! I wasn't bothered by the live version at all...I thought everyone was excellent, and loved the live orchestra. I would definitely recommend this CD to those that love 'Dreamgirls'!"
1,This is not a real Blu Ray Disc!!!,"I am very upset for this product.This is not a real Blu Ray disc but a Blu Ray recorded (something like a CD-R).I have a Sony PS3 and a beautiful Denon DVD-A1UD hi-end player but this disc disc do not works (both the players are updated at the last firmaware).It is a SHAME that Amazon sell an ""home made"" blu ray that is absolutely different in comparison of industrial quality products.I am sendin back this fake disc.PS: The cover and the label disc are printed with a copier and PC printer!!!!"
2,my copy was a COPY actually.,"Unfortunately, I didn't cared reading other reviews before buying this, I don't know why amazon let this kind of things be sold in here. The disc is a BD-R printable, the cover is printed with an inkjet printer, the box is a generic box of very poor quality. It costs like an original but it's a copy."
1,DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!,"This movie was horrible. I've watched the movie and read the book. I absolutly loved the book. This movie didn't come close. It had nothing to do with the book, and I'm upset they even associate Koontz with the movie. His books rock, but not this movie. The monster looked like an anteater! Anyway, I encourage you to read the book, but please spare yourself from the movie."
3,"Out of all the WATCHER movies, this is the Dean R Koontz boo","what is there now...4 versions of the book. This is the closest that you will get. not the greatest movie, but more faithful to the story. The dog's performance as Einstein stills the show."
1,Tresemme Vitamin C Deep Cleansing Shampoo,"First, this shampoo smells really, really good. Both my daughter and I really liked the smell right away. Second, the shampoo seemed to clean really well and left our hair shiny.BUT, both my daughter and I got a horrible rash on our scalps as a result of using this. And, saying it was a rash is putting it mildly. We both ended up with scabs (!) on our scalps because of the shampoo.By the time we figured out that our problem was the shampoo, we had gone through what I purchased here on Amazon and I had purchased more of this elsewhere. To say the least, I quickly returned the bottles I purchased elsewhere and I have no plans of ever purchasing this again."
5,S-VIDEO COUPLER,I needed a coupler for a projector that I located in the celing of my living room. This worked as I could mot find a s-video cable long enough.
1,"Errors, errors, errors","In my opinion this book needs to be proof read, pre-tested, and a revised second edition releasedASAP.There are too many typo errors and code errors to list. To get a reasonable idea of the problems the book is creating have a look at the tutorial forum ""webboard"" and note the comments at ...You will notice too that there are a lot of unanswered questions there. I found myself spending more time on the forum page looking for answers to the errors in the book than actually reading it.This is so disappointing, I have bought the Flash books from friends of Ed, and they are superb, first class. I expected this book to be of the same calibre, but it was not to be.As it stands now, I have struggled to reach chapter seven and I am unable to study the book any further, I am considering purchasing another similar book elsewhere.This book is probably OK if you already have a good working knowledge of ASP and Access, then you can sort the mistakes out as you go along."
1,Not as I expected.,"after reading many reviews,I decided to pick this book for studying Ultradev in details. But after taking a look at and doing some few chapters, I feel terribly disappointed from unclear exercises and explainations about Ultradev. Finally, I think I will sell this book to others."
1,Read a real historian if you want facts and not propaganda,"This is a great example of revisionist history. Read John Tolland, an extraordinary historian who relies primarily on first person sources. Who did Japan use to survey Hiroshima the day after the bomb dropped? The scientist who headed the Japanese atomic bomb program, that's who. If they won the race would they have used it on us? You bet. They'd already proved their visciousness. And if Germany hadn't fallen, how far behind us were they in their atomic development? Just a few months. We only used it first because we got it first. It could have easily gone differently. Hindsight is useless in criticizing the decisions of the past since it always includes information not available to the decision makers (though we did know about the German and Japanese nuclear programs) and inventing conspiracies is a common tactic of the far left (aka, Communists) to try and get people to hate America. This is just another try."
4,Great computer game,My son is a gamer- he loves anything on the computer or game systems!! Was a huge Thomas fan- enjoyed the games!!!
4,gritty chunky scrapy grindy bass,"very good classic industrial album. The bass is nice too. Nice and dark, lots of great metal sounds and beats. Warm Leatherette is a CLASSIC, you should recognize it. Great for fetish show background music or any type of exhibition show."
1,If only they can wirte instructions in plain English,"I bought this router over a year ago, and after spending about a week setting it up, I succeeded despite the Quick Guide and Manual written in goobledygook.In December last year, 2005, Asus released a firmware update of about 400 Gb compressed (about 1 Gb after decompressing), but until now, May 2, 2006, I have not been able to install it following the Guide and Manual."
1,wrong photo,What is one to think of a book about a particular group in a particular air force whose cover shows aircraft never flown by that group and belonging to another country? Can't blame the author. Who then?
2,hurts ears bad sound for the price,ok... these headphones are ok.but u cant return them and they hurt ears do yourself a favor and do not buy these
2,Are You Folks Listening to the Same 'Phones?!,"Guys, come on now. I'm by no means an audiophile, but when headphones that cost $120+ (CAD) start distorting at moderate volumes on a piano concerto, there isn't much room for argument. These headphones are among the worst quality I've ever heard, especially for their price range. The bass is muddy and seems detached from the music, as at higher volumes, the bass comes out as almost background noise. The high end is shrill and overpowering, I actually got a mild headache from using these headphones.I used these for a day at work (office setting), listening to various genres of music including classical, hip hop, heavy metal, progressive rock, etc. The only genre that these did nicely in is techno, and even then I didn't get the bass response needed. After that day of work, I returned them (the same day I bought them). Piffle.DO NOT BUY these, look elsewhere for high-end earbuds."
2,No bass and too loud!,"I had sony MDR-AS40EX before this which I got for 40 bucks; unfortunately its left side ear piece got short.So I ordered creative aruvana and got these delivered yesterday. The packing was shiny and while opening I felt like the sound should be amazing too. But the joy didnt last a second I listened to the earphones. It was too loud, I know how to adjust the volume. But when you put it to nominal level the Bass disappears.My friend had 10 bucks panasonic earphones. Which when we compared sounded better than this piece of crap."
2,Creative disappoints this time with an unstable product,"Creative is widely known for the sound quality of their products. As an owner of a Zen X-Fi player I must agree that this is usually the case. However, these earphones are a disappointment in comparison to the much cheaper EP-630 that also come with the player, and that I was extremely satisfied with for over a year until the cable broke.I bought a pair of Aurvanas here in Amazon and received a defective unit in which there was very loud static in low volumes. Amazon sent me replacements by request. The new ones do not have static, but their overall sound quality is dubious, especially in the mid-range in high volumes that sometimes cracks - nothing I experienced while using the EP-630s.It seems that this is an unstable product. Even if the sound quality is decent,the price gap between this set and Creative's cheaper models is definitely not justified. I would pass this one."
2,"Movie A+, Remastered Version D-","Not criticizing the movie, which has been a favorite of mine since I was a teen, but just the Remastered DVD that was recently released: When the point-of-view goes to that of the Brainstorm machine, the film looks and sounds fantastic (2.35:1 widescreen and 5.1 Dolby Digital surround) - Unfortunately, that's only about 15% of the movie. The rest of the time there is a serious cropping issue in which your viewing screen becomes 1/3 smaller, maybe more, and the sound is nothing spectacular. I watched this on a 40"" HDTV and a 27"" analog set, same disappointing effect. I'm sticking with my original 2000 version, which is shown mostly in 1.85:1 ws, then switching to 2.35:1 for the point-of-view special scenes. A little lower video quality, but much more enjoyable to watch, and the stereo soundtrack sounds almost the same."
1,Been a Loyal Customer 4 YEARS!!!!,Where is my shipment. I've been a LOYAL customer of yours for many years!!! I guess it is time to go elsewhere!! Corporate Greed wins all as ever.
3,"Good idea on the technology-gone-bad theme, but...","I love the idea that ideas/feelings can be transferred, even commanded, between brains; that'd be great for the therapists that would be required after that technology was created! The sub-story of a love gone bad, but rekindled, was nice. For those reasons I bought it.That all said, even when I watched it when it came out in theaters (when acoustical modems were on the way out), the spoiler of the movie was not the recording device, holographic film, or simple external headsets for transference: it was using an acoustical modem to access the corporate database and playback mechanism, as well just using the phone system--it wasn't even cast in a futuristic light where at least fiber optics could handle the load.I got the movie for the love story, fighting against the corporate/military machine, and exploration aspects. It's a three because of the major detractors; otherwise I'd make it a four."
1,Two redeeming qualities- perhaps three,"OK, so I saw this moive when it came out in theaters and I decided to rent it a month ago and re-see it. It was still as bad as I remember it being. There are only three redeeming qualities and that is stretching it. They are the use of Pachelbel's canon, Russell Crowe just being on the screen, and Russell Crowe singing ""Waltzing Mathilda"". It worth seeing once, but it is a slow moving film, the supporting characters are boring and cliched, and the plot is really quite weak."
4,Poetic movie,"One may find this movie slow-going at first. Stay with it long enough, and you'll find the storyline and characters starting to develop. What touched me the most is the reality of wartime personal struggles depicted through the story of the characters in the movie. The story may be fictional, but the lives, thoughts, and the choices they had to make were real."
4,it really works!,i love these swaddleme blanket! it really works! the only thing i didnt like much about them is that they dont really last that long after a few wash.
2,I think a nice soft blankie is still preferable,"This was a gift for my new grandbaby. I had to wash it before giving it to her because it had a funny odor. It didn't wash up very soft either. I still prefer a good soft flannel blanket for swaddling. When buying it, I was not aware of the Made in China factor, but it was a learning experience."
4,Great Product,"The Swaddle blanket worked wonderful for my 6 week old. She slept much more restful. However, like other reviewers, it did shrink and at 10 weeks it no longer fits her at 11 lbs. I purchased the large size and it is huge. A friend told me she added extra velcro to hers to allow it to fit more snug. There needs to be a medium size! All in all, I felt like I could not live without this blanket and have stocked up on extras to give as gifts to friends."
5,couldn't live without it,Both of my babies loved to be swaddled and this was the only thing they could not get out of. A must have for sure!
4,"Good, but we only used it for 2 weeks","We bought this based on the recommendation from a friend saying that this was a true ""live safer"" to get her baby boy to fall asleep at night. We used this on our baby girl for approx. 2 weeks and stopped using it altogether. Nice product, but we found that our child didn't like to be swaddled to tightly and instead this actually agrivated her and kept her up at night unless we had her arms totally pinned into the Kiddopatamus. Each kid is different I suppose.When we first brought her home and the first two weeks afterwards the Kiddopatamus did help to calm them and beat us trying to swaddler her with just using a blanket."
4,Nice addition to my collection!,"I'm a 20-something knitter who likes creative projects and funky yarn. I would attempt to make most of the projects in this book. I initially purchased the book with plans to make one of the wraps, but found that it has a ton of other patterns that I can't wait to try. Great pictures, beautiful yarns, clear instructions. It is a nice addition to my collection and worth the purchase price!"
1,TINY box!!!,"Since this box of Whitman's cost the same amount as the one you would buy at the drugstore, I didn't think twice about staring hard at the picture or really reading what size it is. This box is TINY!! It contains 4 chocolates and for that you pay $9.00!!!!!I sadly ordered 2 of these as Valentines gifts for my mother and sister and spent close to $20.00 for them. I am so frustrated and just wanted to alert others that this box size goes for .60 in the stores. Stay away!!!"
1,Tiny box of candy at a very inflated price.,"I looked at the size of this item and realized that this is the 1.75 oz box. I thought it was a mistake, but, no - this is really that tiny little box with abut 4 pieces of candy that sells for a dollar or less at most stores. So if you ordered this item it would cost you $13 with the shipping, at a time when most stores sell the 10-12 oz box for $5. What's more, although this box is less than 2oz in weight, the seller is charging 6 dollars to ship it! I cannot understand why Amazon is allowing this merchant to get away with such fraud."
5,gcooperman,"I purchased this trolley tote in time for an international trip that involved six flights and walks through airports. I am absolutely thrilled with it and wished I had bought one years ago. It is light weight, holds all the things you might need to take on board with you with room to spare for a few things you could use if your checked baggage doesn't arrive when you do. The interior is not designed for holding a laptop and thus I had more room for articles I wanted to pack. The tote seems durable, it is easily maneuverable and it is light enough to be easy to store in the overhead cabin. I heartily recommend this product."
5,Some excellent improvments over the previous version. 2 Thumbs Up!,"Was using the previous version, when one day I noticed a banner display on my Spyware X-terminator program display that mentioned a free update to version 2005. So I jumped on the deal.I like the updated interface design.The program found several items that other scanners had missed.The new version adds colored dots [buttons?] that indicate the severity of the item it found, from LOW to HIGH, and also an UNKNOWN.I've only tried it a few times. Since the 1st run through one's pc really cleans things up, it's hard to compare it directly to another anti-sppware cleaner.[What I should have done was to run it ONLY to DETECT the ""mal-ware"" and then ran my other anti-spy programs and compared]:-items found-items missed [if any]-etcBut I didn't.All things considered, my 2 favorites are:1. Webroot spy-sweeper2. Spyware Xterminator 2005"
2,A bad movie from a tour that resulted in a great CD,"Joe Cocker - Mad Dogs & Englishmen (DVD of the film): While I treasure the CD album of this tour, the film is a long way from being `the greatest', in fact, it is a bad movie. The filmmakers obviously tried to use the same kind of techniques used in the Woodstock film but the result is barely tolerable. There is a feature on the DVD that allows you to skip the junk and watch just the concert performances but even there, the film is poor. I wish this were better. I certainly appreciate that there is any film of this tour, but that footage was mishandled here. I do like to pan another's work but my intention is to encourage you not to judge the Great audio CD based on your experience with this mainly irritating film."
2,Where's the beef!,"I thought this was going to be a concert. Too much talk, travel footage and very little music."
4,Mad Dogs and Englishmen,"I saw this film in the theatre when it was originally released in 1970 and have been trying to get a copy ever since. It is still a remarkable music film featuring some of the best musicians at the time. Joe is at his best, fresh from Woodstock and riding a wave of hits that made him a very familiar name in Rock. The one thing that I found amusing was the language of the cover and CD label is Spanish. The film in is English so don't worry if you get this and see all the written word is in Spanish."
2,Not recommended,"I found this book to be boring and poorly written. Although it covers an interesting topic (betting syndicates), it offers no real insights or anything new. The author provides agonizing details on the football bets he placed and it soon begins to feel like you are reading the same chapter over and over. His frequent references to the proclivities of his girlfriend seem out of place and unrelated to the story - is he bragging? or trying to make her look bad? In any event, why should we care?After reading the book, and then seeing the author as an announcer on a TV-Poker show, it becomes clear that he is capitalizing on the new fads, but just isn't bringing enough to the party."
1,Left A LOT to be desired,"This book is terribly repetitive. How on earth someone can take Las Vegas and a subject like sports betting and make it boring is beyond me. If the author ever had an ounce of insight, he probably should've shared it. He should stick to journalism and avoid narrative writing."
1,Rubbish,"The claims in this book are preposterous. The author did not bother to site any research through scientific agencies such as NIDA or SAMHSA which unequevically state that alcoholism is a biological, social, and spiritual disease caused by the indisputable evidence of physiological changes in the nucleus accumbens. This is a garbage book full of junk science, ameteur psychology, and an incredible amount of biased attitude."
3,Wide width gets smaller.,"I have had great success with New Balance shoes before.However, I returned these because they were too tight.Apparently, widths are not what they once were."
4,New Balance MW576,"Product is good quality. I think the price is a little high. This was a Prime Item, but did not receive Prime shipping speed. Took over 8 days for product to arrive."
3,May or may not be the shoe for you,"I ordered these shoes for my husband. They were the same style, but a couple of generations later, than what he had been wearing. When they came and he tried them on, he said they felt good, but...the toe box is super wide and they looked very clunky. Think Mickey Mouse shoes. My husband loves comfort and pretty much doesn't care what anything looks like as long as it feels good, but even he thought they looked very big and wide. So we returned them. If you want a really roomy toe box, these could be just the shoes for you. Comfort and fit should trump appearance, so it's just a matter of opinion."
5,Hariprasad- The Flute master,Has done it once again in style. Absolutely phenomenal. Has a distinct Indian flavour to the music.
5,Great Lyricism and Energetic Pop Punk,No Motiv is one of the band's that makes any musician want to pick up the guitar and start rocking away. I picked up this cd in NYC and have been listening to it since I got back to school. It's incredible.
5,PURE GRADE A,"This is what book writing is about. The rich story, the people, the surroundings and most of all the entire plot is 100 percent pure masterpiece. This to me is Cassie's greatest book, this also was my first Cassie book, I knew after reading this that I would find and read every book she had, and thats what I have been doing for along time. This book grabs you holds on to you until the very end and then you don't want to let it go. I never really wanted this book to end it was such a fine read, you fall in love, you feel it, you see it and you become apart of the book. This is a must read, a must have part of your book collection."
2,"So, So...I think it could have been better.","This was my first Cassie Edwards book...and my last. The book starts off great. Good story, strong characters, lots of heartache...but then it just fizzles. Where does it go wrong? When Shane first meets Melanie and they immediatly get it on. I'm sorry, but there is no way you can just start going at it in the woods with some wild man and be instantly in love. I guess if you want to buy this book, pick it up in the used department. Hopefully you can find it for a penny...cause that's as much as I would pay for it."
2,A thoroughly disappointing novel.,"This book was a disappointment from start to finish. Characters that are not believable populate mundane events that never lead to anything, nor do they resolve in the end. Three women who we are to believe are strong in positive and negative ways come across as shallow and peripheral. A thoroughly unsatisfying read."
3,"Good laces, but short","I guess this is my fault, but when i received these, I realized they were shorter than i had hoped they would be. Know your shoelace lengths!"
3,"Not acceptable condition, poor condition","Received book in timely manner but the entire book was warped from water damage, many pages were bent and edges were scraped and damaged, cover was also damaged."
1,Oh...My!,"A friend I admire recommended the book. I read it..had a difficult time with the self agrandizement of the author. He was idealistic and preachy at best. Having worked at a retreat center for ten years of my life, when I was young and hopeful, I experienced first hand the hyprocracy of those who wrote books telling people what to do/how to live/what ""Jesus meant"" and yet couldn't come near to living what they preached. It is nice to think that Shane is living what he is preaching, but he does come across as a bit too much of a know it all and a stone thrower."
3,The Revolution,"The book wasn't too bad, but some of the incidents in the book i believe should have been a little more descriptive.Overall the book could really change your life & your outlook on it."
4,I thought I was the only one who thought this way,"I'm glad to know that I'm not.This book points out a lot of biblical truths that we seem to have forgotten or blatantly ignored. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone. There were some minor things that I disagreed with, and many things that I'm still mulling over. But the issues he brought up need to be thought and prayed over. Too many people don't consider them deeply enough. Even if you don't agree with some of his conclusions, if it makes you truly and deeply think about the issues, it's worth it.It's also a very easy read. His writing style is funny and serious at the same time. I enjoyed his humor and straightforwardness very much."
2,Inconsistent message,"I read Shane's book, and was so inspired that I asked him to speak at our church. Funny thing that he elects poverty but wouldn't come to my church, jokingly turning us down because we didn't offer him enough money. I hope he walks his talk, and perhaps it's just his advisors who are sending the inconsistent message."
3,"I'm an environmentalist too, but.....","I normally greatly enjoy reading accounts of women hiking the Appalachian Trail. Hikers telling their own story don't just tell about the trail, they tell about themselves. Often they have a very unique personality and it is interesting to get to know them. In this case, not so much. The author of this book, Adrienne Hall, is very young, and her interests and personality are those of a self-important high school girl (think Meadow Soprano from the HBO series). She writes very long passages about the environment that are very preachy and sanctimonious. She writes a lot about her boyfriend and what other people should do about the environment, and not so much about how the trail helped her grow as a person. This is one of the very few Appalachian Trail books I have read where I found myself struggling to stick with reading, frequently skipping pages."
4,a honest and interesting read!,"I have read many books on the Appalchian trail, and this one felt so honest to me. I picked it up at a local library before I left for a vacation at a rustic cabin in the woods of Maine. Quickly, my yearly camping experience in Maine no longer felt nearly so rustic. Ms. Hall does not romanticize life on the trail, she gives the reader insight into the loneliness and pain. I also enjoyed her strong environmental voice. I would have liked a little more discussion on the social interaction with other thru hikers, but that is the only area I found lacking. I would recommend this book for anyone who would like to read from a woman's voice on the trail. Adrienne Hall is an author I would like to read more of. Did she tie the knot with Craig?"
2,Graphics/screen size are a joke on modern hardware,"Screen size is fixed at 800x600. If (like me) you've invested in a high end graphics card (nvidia GeForce) and a high resolution LCD monitor (1280x1024) you're likely to be appalled at the game's graphics. Various user mods have attempted to improve the situation with more detailed ship models and more readable fonts. If you have a CRT and loved the earlier games then it may be worth a try, but on an LCD you'll either have a tiny rectangle in the middle of the screen or a headache inducing blur."
1,Probaby the worst book I've ever read!,"I love to read all different types of books, and I unapologetically sometimes enjoy a ""light"" mystery or romance, especially for a vacation or beach read. Howver, there is a difference between ""light"" and downright ridiculous! The plot had so many holes and inconsistencies that it almost seemed as if it were written by a teenager as a first attempt at being an author. The only reason I gave it 1 star is that there is no way to choose ""zero"" star rating. It is the only book I have ever read in my life that I promptly threw in the garbage.This was my first Fern Michaels book, and will certainly be my last!"
2,Too high...,"Unless you have a swan (or artificially extended) neck, this shoulder rest will be too high for you. I bought this as a replacement for my Everest, but it's actually more uncomfortable.I'm currently searching for a chinrest pad. My current shoulder rest is fine, except I can't seem to get a good grip on it without clenching my teeth (bad habit)."
4,helpful guide,"It doesn't list actual apartments, but it has 3 narrow pages on every neighborhood in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, & Queens plus short essays on related topics. It gives statistics on neighborhoods including race, household income, rent costs, safety and commuting time. Although note that the info on Harlem is debatable, so don't believe every word. The most important thing missing is a subway map. No doubt it is helpful."
4,Great Baby naming tool,It's brilliant and interesting to read the detailed meanings in this book. Number 8 on My top of the Top Baby Names book list.
1,wrong edition no stars,"cover look like 9th edition, which is what I needed, but got a 7th edition. Book is useless. No method of exchange or return."
4,Hmmm....,"This game is fairly interesting, but is a bit short for me. I found playing as a dino pretty silly. Running over dudes in metal suits got kind of old.Dino hunting is fun, except for the small dinos who run too fast to get a good shot at. I often let a few chase me, jump up on something, then kill the pesky things with a good blast of my x rifle. Also, some of the people I tried to rescue were annoyingly stupid, getting in my way. Loading times were a bit long also, but the graphics were nice (apparently the Serious Sam engine).A cautious recommendation. Worth it if you find it cheap. For fun combat, try No One Lives Forever. Not a hunting game, but a shooter that is ten times the fun for about the same price."
2,What a disappointment!,"The problem with self-published writing is that it often doesn't go through a rigorous editing process: such is the case with this novel. I was really looking forward to reading the story, but I couldn't even get through the first ten pages. It's the most poorly written book I've ever come across. The author deserves credit for going through the excruciating process of committing her story to paper (which is the only reason I gave this effort two stars), but she needs some SERIOUS editing help. This book is an insult to intelligent readers."
4,Excellent performance & teaching but no written music or tab,"I bought this DVD hoping to learn at least some of the included songs. Doug Smith's performances are a pleasure to watch, and his detailed teaching on each piece is very helpful and enlightening. However (and this is a huge however), the publishers did not include a pdf file with the music/tab on the DVD. If the written music file was included, this would be a 5-star-plus, but even with Doug's excellent performance and teaching (including left and right-hand views), it will be very difficult to learn these songs without written music. I will now have to buy the book-CD with the sheet music for another $16.50..."
3,cute little web cam with just above avarage quality,I like this web cam (and a digital cam) because it was what I needed. Nothing too [spendy] and complicated. I didnt need the greatest picture quality. Just something that would help me to video chat with my friends over the internet and send them some digital pictures. First of all to use this camera you need alot of light..You wont be able to use it in dark..Your face and where the camera stands must be lighted really good. If you do that quality is really nice for it. However sometimes it can be frustrating if you dont have a portable lamp or a portable computer. Otherwise it is really good. It is good for you if your reasons are same with me and if you have pretty good lighting. Digital cam is ok. You can unplug the web cam and use it as camera but light thing has to be the same here. Don't expect digital camera quality. It is easy to use and quick but quality is avarage.
1,The disappearing rebate...,"Well, before even using the product, I'm pretty upset at the disappearing rebate... It was valid until late December, but the file has suddenly disappeared from the RebatesHQ website. Pretty deceptive; hard to rate well an item that didn't cost what you thought it did. Think I will be returning this -- unless someone happens to have a copy of the rebate form saved?"
5,A Life In Entertainment,"If you like inside baseball stories, you'll love this book. Michael Jenkins has traveled the globe, met Presidents and had some amazing adventures--both in the theatre and in building amusement parks around the world.His pithy writing style and short chapters format make the book a fast and entertaining read. Plus it has some terrific pictures to support the stories!A must read for any theatre producer or people who love these type of stories."
1,The Comma Police!!!,"No, that's not a comma in the title of this book on the cover, it's the ""registered trademark"" symbol. I think this is Amazon's mistake. Else this book's author, editor and publisher should be all taken out and shot."
3,Mixed Views,"There are many spots where I was cracking up and my jaw was on the floor from how bold Marcus was. But there were other parts of this plot that were just way too overboard (church women with guns who never seemed to know anything about guns before, minus the security guard, the strange way one of them just happened to have a jar of something that Marcus feared even though she didn't know he feared it beforehand, the way no charges were pressed or the t.v. producer wasn't fired for attacking a guest, the whole rape/rough sex was absolutely unnecessary, etc.) The book's plot was good but after awhile, I think the author went too far and it just turned into a bad action movie."
4,TV Ears,Product works GREAT and helps me to enjoy TV viewing even more now that I can hear better...
1,Cheap and bad but works for short time,"Piece of junk!!! Worked excellent after 10 months! But like everyone says, ""it works"", just wait a while and you will see the transmitter go out! Product is cheap and when you call, they say to get the product coverage(more money) and they will replace it! but for half the price!!(more money!)Pay extra for a piece of junk? Are you kidding me? If they had a better transmitter which they do...digital(for $230.00 or so)then why not incorporated it into the cheaper 2.3 model without all those bells and whistles? To all that say it is a great headphone wait a while...I would love to hear your feedback and follow up on a potential good product if only they do some research on that freaking cheap transmitter. BTW I used up 5 of these sets already....all went bad. Thanks to Cosco for replacing all of them the many times I took them back. Am surviving only on 2 now with 3 backups gone already (Cosco finally discontinued them!I wonder why?"
1,Pass this up,Battery life 1-2 hours. Cuts out at about 10'. Poor sound quality. OUCH !!!. These really hurt. The ear tips are cheap and poke and are heavy. You will just return them or throw them away.
2,"At it's core, simply not funny","When you strip away the language, nudity, and adult themes and just look at the comedy, this show is very poor. And I want to be clear that I'm in no way commenting on the production quality. Sunny in Philadelphia has poor production quality and it's hilarious. The joke set-ups are so cheesy and telegraphed."
1,PDAsync is PDAstink,"After my initial sync I could not get PDAsync to transfer additional info between my Jornada 568 and Act 2000. My attempts to retrieve usable info from Laplink's (PDAsync's parent company) so-called ""knowledge base"" and their tech support have, so-far, been futile.For tech support, you are permitted one ""free"" telephone call, then you must pay a price... per incident/call (one call is approx. the cost of the entire program!). Don't try to e-mail them either. They won't accept e-mails without first filling out their form, complete with a serial number. Of course, they don't send out a serial number when you download the product directly from them ... even after purchasing it.So far, not only has this product cost me money, but it has cost me lots of time. Trust me on this one, pay a few more bucks and get Intellisync or Companionlink.There is a definite reason why both Laplink Inc. and PDAsync rhyme with ""stink"". They are both rotten."
4,Nice but Not Very Original,"Once again, Melvin Taylor comes across as a very good guitarist and arranger, but not a very good composer or original musician. He borrows songs and styles from original blues musicians such as John Lee Hooker and Jimi Hendrix and puts them to good use, but he doesn't have a single composition or style of his own. His rendition of Chill Out/The Healer and Blue Jean Blues are wonderful."
3,"Yahtzee is good, Sorry is sorry",I have this and have Windows XP. The Yahtzee works great and is alot of fun but the Sorry will not even install on XP. Not really a good deal to get both if one or the other won't work on XP.
3,ritz dye,The color not what I had hoped for and does not take evenly in the newer type of washing machinelinda Benham
5,good price good product,"The tires were completely as described on line, and they have a very good price. I received them really fast even before the estimated time. Thanks."
2,Gypsy Gold!,Ok I had to read this book for English and well I haft to say thank god it's out of print because I just really didn't connect with the hole story. I don't know if it was just me but it's a book I don't even recommend for the insane! Well I better get back to work because the teacher is looking at me funny!Student of Woodland High
3,Works well for a short time,"While this item worked it was awesome, I was able to get the temp of my covered pool without going outside, however, a poor seal on the device caused it to fail after about 4 months. I am just going to have to purchase a new one each swim season until I find a better wireless pool thermometer."
3,Mediocre Comedy,"Although I love Candy in every film I have seen him in, I was disappointed in this one.... it is slow, looks like it had rewrites along the way, possibly due to his death, but good for a few chuckles along the way. The characters, except for the two leads, are very good and really shine. But Candy is weak in his role, leaving much of his talent by the wayside... again maybe because of his death and scene cutting. I never cared for Richard Lewis and his is just as weak as Candy in this film. The price is right and the editing, photography, and supporting cast make it a worthwhile purchase. The film was poorly written, but comes out as a C+ film overall on DVD."
1,Horrible,This John Candys worst movie ever and I am a big John Candy fan but this was bad. So if you are looking for a bad comedy rent it or buy it.
3,I Was There,This film is very importent for because i was there working like a extra thats why i recomend this film we have many adventures is just great
1,Bad! The worst of Candy's last movies i've seen!,"The acting of John Candy was not funny at all because in his final days while shooting this film in Durango, Mexico. Candy's health became extremely deteroated to his weight. Problems with the smoking and alcholism that led to his death at age 43. Scenes were a complete disaster by these actors for a script that they want it to call a comedy western spoof based on Mel Brooks classic ""Blazing Saddles"". Candy plays a wagonmaster trying to lead and travel with some ranch villagers headed straight east. This is not one of my favorite John Candy movies to enjoy!"
2,OK Movie,"Although I didn't think this movie was as bad as some of the people who reviewed it, I also don't think it's John Candy's best. One thing that might be missed is if you don't know your western history well you won't get some of the jokes!"
1,Don't buy this pile,"I seriously expected a really excellent game when i got this. I was expecting...well...more Unreal. Instead I got this weak Half Life-UT hybrid that is really pretty boring. I was not blown away by any of the graphics, and the soundtrack was nothing special. Certainly not as good as the original Unreal game, which I HIGHLY recommend. In this one, I never had the desire to keep playing. It was one more dead horse mission after the other.This game got too much hype for what it's worth. It has no replayability either. I beat it in 3 days of non-steady playing. I don't think i can sit through that predictably awful storyline one more time. I'd wait for this thing to hit the bargain bin if I were you."
3,California Blonde,"Unreal II is much like the stereotype of a California Blonde. It is absolutely beautiful, but not much going on upstairs. The game undoubtably contains some of the finest graphics available, and it appears this is where the developers invested most of their time and money. The game is plagued by poor AI, and out-of-place voice acting. All this is tied together with a poorly written script. Still despite these major annoyances, the game is still fun in its own mindless rights. If your looking for a new First Person Shooter that requires minimal thought, and your only interest is running and gunning, then this game is for you."
1,Flashy graphics destroy the gaming world,"I would just like to say that I'm a gamer all the wayand I play most of them. I pre-ordered this game and I'mso sorry I did.The reason I did this is because, probably just like yourself,I got carried away with the flashy graphics. Once you takethese away, absolutely nothing remains.The most disturbing thing was the fact that I finished it twicein a weekend, and now it's lying on my shelf. This isoutrageous when you compare it with others like Baldur's gate 2which offers over 300 hours of gameplay.I must conclude that although it was fun to play, it was way toshort, doesn't offer anything new and even got boring at sometimes. I hope someone on this planet can convince you to NOTbuy this game, and continue your search for a game that canthrill you at least for a couple of weeks.Sincerely yours,Niels"
2,"Lots of hype, great graphics...and nothing else!","Unreal 2: The Awakening, a game that myself and thousands of other gamers waited anxiously for years to be finally released. The time finally comes that I get my hands on the game and all that I can really say is that...it was NOT worth the wait!The graphics are awesome, there's no question there...BUT! A ponderous, boring storyline that could've been written by a twelve year old cutting and pasting from old comics coupled with gameplay that reminds me of two dimensional titles off of the old Super Nintendo console rather than something cutting edge make this a real let down...Legend..! You've put out some great multiplayer games in the past but I'm starting to think you no longer have a clue how to make a great single-player driven title! Get with it!"
3,Its not half bad.,I've played it...its not nearly as bad as everyone is saying. In fact the graphics weren't nearly as bad as I thought they would be. You guys all need to shut up about how bad this game is cause its really not half as bad as you guys are complaining about. Just cause this is an average game doesn't mean that you guys should bash it. If you like average PC shooters then this is definately the game for you. The graphics are not as good as playstation 2 or anything. I don't want to hear anymore BAD reviews about this game. I've played many many games that were worse then this.
1,TOO SHORT,"I could have seen 8 movies for the price of this game, and I would have gotten twice the entertainment time. Graphics are ""nice"" game play is ""ok"" BOSSES are worthless. NO ONLINE PLAY. ADDS UP TO LOWEST PLAY/$ VALUE GAME I'VE EVER OWNED."
2,major let down,"i bought this when it came out (full price!), eagerly expecting the awesome storyline, revolutionary non-linear play, blinding graphics and amazing engine it promised. What i got was a sub-par, completely linear storyline; LAME characters (the hero often refers to the female member of the crew as 'toots' in annoyingly stereotypal 'marine' voice); adequate play and good graphics, all rolled together in a game that i took a few short hours to finish and that i haven't touched since.Impressive visuals don't make up for not-so-impressive everything else. Plus, i found the techno-electronic-whatever soundtrack utterly rubbish to blast stuff to. break out the quake3arena and be happy it didn't just cost you over $60."
2,A Waste of Technology,I am very impressed with the graphics. The problem with this game is the lack of content. It is a frenzy of mindless carnage--just shoot shoot shoot. Like Serious Sam on steroids. To take a beautiful graphics engine such as this and use it to produce adolescent rubbish is a crime against technology.
4,Impressive,"If you're looking for Debussy's La mer played with intensity and brilliance, this CD is for you. What it lacks in atmosphere, it more than makes up for in power and precision."
2,ICKY BOOK,As a speech pathology student who was required to take an anatomy class with this being the required text - this book was horrible. In each chapter there is sooo much missing information and holes and gaps in the information that it made learning anatomy that much harder. The only good thing about this book is that it comes with a helpful anatomy cd for the cdrom... i preferred the Netter anatomy book instead.
2,HORRID PACKAGING,"The packaging for my product was falling apart!! The product was water stained too, since it does snow where I live!! GET BETTER PACKAGING, I will no longer be doing service with these people."
3,A bit pricey....,I have to agree that the quality is good...but I am not sure it is worth what it is. I just saw another brand at Costco for $20 (Melissa and ...brand) that I think is comparable and had more selection.
3,Beautiflly produced book of recycled pictures,"The book is an excellent introduction the beauty of African masks for the beginning enthusiast, presenting excellent photographs of arguably some of the most beautiful examples of masks of the various tribes of Africa. For the more advanced enthusiast the book is a let-down - most of the images are recycled from other publications. There is a scarcity of new material and new examples. I can therefore recommend this book only for those who want to get a first visual impression of the wonderful arts of Africa, without getting into much ethnography or cultural background."
3,"A pleasant, uneventful run-through","As anyone knows who has followed his career, the once energetic and incisive Colin Davis turned sober and dull some time in the Eighties. Since then he's shown sporadic moments of revival, particularly in Berlioz, but this LSO Live performance of the Dvorak Sixth isn't one of them.I think the one-star reviewer below has everything right. Davis wasn't having a good day; everything sounds professional but blandly routine, with sluggish tempos in the first movement and furiant. He's also right about the sound, which is veyr close on the woodwinds but leaves the strings sounding distant and thin. It's also stingy not to include a filler. A regretful pass."
1,"100 things to AVOID before you die, like this book","This book is the worst. The suggestions of things to do are just plain aweful. It seems to suggest every crowded fair and typical tourist attraction in any city. This would be great if you love crowds and mayhem. The suggestions are useless. New Years Eve in Times square? Mardi Gras? Acadamy Awards? Carnaval? Who's not aware of these events? It could have some redeaming qualities if it had suggestions about where to stay and how to plan these types of trips, but it does not offer any other information than the dates and location. Nobel Prize Ceremonies? Running of the Bulls? Come on!!!! What a waste of paper, money and time."
5,"Great book for world ""connoisseurs""","This book puts your life in perspective, it tells you that there are important things to do in your life before your time is up, important places to see and experience. It shows you another way to plan your holidays around a special event anywhere in the world. Also it tells you not to go if such an event is taking place. The book is a terrific ""travel companion"" and a sort of incentive to find out what's really going on in the world among the natives. The spirit in which it was written is great and easy to read. Congratulations to Neil and David !"
2,Too Silly,"I didn't know this book would list the dumb things to do before you die. I'll pass on the bog swimming, testicle festivals and penis parades for the real eventss I don't want to miss like the Balloon Fiesta."
4,"""Unmissability"" is in the eye of the beholder","Dave Freeman et al have provided some useful ideas on travel events that you just can't miss in this little book. Some of them are splendid, but some of them slightly cliched or bizarre. I, for one, would be happy never to go to Stoke-on-Trent again, especially since the scampi in the pub was off, no matter what the waiter said. The Barnes wetlands centre is, admittedly, a decent visit for the family, though not necessarily a ""must-see"". On balance, pretty good."
4,Interesting Take on Jesus,The author posits that Jesus' deificaiton was a construct of later ages in the quest to make people victims. The author gives a fair review of the literature of the debate regarding Jesus' existence as an actual historical figure. Add it to the library on the most important figure in Western history.
2,From a Davis Fan,"This is not one of the better Bette Davis movies.For those of us who like Davis as an independant, strong-willed toughie, this movie just doesn't add up. The story is uninteresting, as is Davis' character. For those who must see it, I suggest trying to rent it first before you buy it."
3,"lacks good, hard, concise facts","Where are most superheroes orphaned at an early age? What is the purpose of groups of superheroes? Why does Batman have a preadolescent sidekick? Why are there also superheroines?I'm afraid I can't answer any of these questions. The author of this book discusses all of these questions, but his discussion is a little too hazy for me."
4,Oldie and still a goodie...,"I remember watching this series as I was a little kid. The comedy was funny, the tragedy was moving during the entire run of the show. Funny how we're still combating the same issues, prejudices and ignorance 30 years later. All is good, except this first season set doesn't really put the episodes in any real order. Other than that, it's great to watch again."
3,disrespectful not to remaster the sound!,"This is one of the all-time classic shows and it should have a remastered picture & dolby sound, like they did for Star Trek. The fact that it's uncut is great but the sound is awful."
3,Couldn't finish,I've probably read 200 books in this genre (crime fiction). The writing was breezy and contemporary but nothing much happened and I lost interest.
4,Joseph's wife,"I have used Fun Betty myself in a brown shade to match the hair on my head. Otherwise, both areas would be an unattractive mixture of gray and brown. I purchased the pink Fun Betty as a Christmas gift to my sister in law who' s head hair is tinted a blond mixture. I have had great success with the brown Fun Betty, just use a small amount and it lasts a long time."
2,"Loved it in the '60s, but now...","""Coffee, Tea, or Me?"" is fun to read if you're into the current 1960s retro movement, or if you grew up in those days as I did. However, some of the content is offensive today, particularly the entire chapter devoted to gay-bashing (this was written just before men were ""allowed"" to become ""flight attendants"".) And the two or three sequel books are downright inane. Still, ""Coffee, Tea, or Me?"" is worth a read as long as you keep in mind the era that it represents."
3,Product,This is a good product but do they have to sell the monitor separately. They could have a package where everything was included like the monitor and printer.
5,It's the 1940s -- in stereo!,"There are only a few swing bands these days who sound anything like the original swingers or who can perform a cover song with any justice. The Blue Saracens are one of these bands. The songs on here are crisp and clean and Nicole Frydman's powerful vocals are simply astounding. What I find refreshing is that the 12 selections offer a range of tempos instead of choosing to stick with a medium beat throughout the album. If you're tired of neo-swing bands that sound too much like rock bands, you're best bet is to get your hands on a copy of this CD. You won't regret it."
3,Good but dated.,"I tried to work out the examples from Calculus Refresher but found them to be dated and sometimes archaic. Sure, some of them problems are modern, but I rather stick with any modern day calculus textbook and learn something from it. There is a nice question-and-answer format in Calculus Refresher, and the printing makes the text easily accessible. The explanations are decently nice. However, my knowledge didn't feel sufficiently increased from the book. The solutions in the back of the book are there, but they are selected and final without any worked out details. All in all, if I were you and want to solve problems, I would pick up some discontinued college calculus textbook and go from there rather than the book Calculus Refresher which was written in 1945, and a lot has been changed to this day. On the other hand, Calculus Refresher is a good explanatory book."
1,Great doorstop.,"Two major flaws. 1. Video is very poor, unwatchable, due to video card problems, which hp knows about but refused to fix. 2. The keyboard will quit working. This problem hp knows about but yet again refused to address. So if you do not want to use your laptop for video or typing this is the perfect machine."
4,The Mystery of the Shroud of Turin by John Iannone,"The information contained in the book can be classified into two types: scientific and historical. The scientific evidence is well presented, easily understood by the lay person, and very, very convincing. The author's story of how the shroud came to be in Turin, however, is rife with raw speculation and tenuous connections, the veracity of which I am unable to judge. The good news is that you can believe that the Shroud is the true burial cloth of Jesus Christ based entirely on the scientific evidence!The editing leaves a bit to be desired. There are endless repetitions of much of the information, almost as if the various sections of the book were written by different authors who did not read each other's work.All in all, however, the book was well worth reading, especially for those of us who are new to the details of this wonderful, miraculous story."
5,A MUST read for any one who seeks to know the Mantra.,Swami Radha has brought the ancient wisdom tought to her by her Guru from Rishikish and made this wisdom accessible to the western mind. She shows us how it works within the context of the western experience and she is constantly encouraging us to know from our own explorations of the Mantra. She is indeed a very powerful and enlightened writer who by example shows us the power of speech and the power of the ancient chants.
4,"Very, very good - as a primer","Mr. ""Party"" has compiled a very good starter book for ensuring one's privacy but this is not a treatise that will provide everything you need to know.Still, you probably won't need another book because you probably won't feel it necessary even to follow all the suggestions in this volume. And there are plenty here - more than enough for most purposes.In short, this is a great place to start if you feel the need to take back some privacy, but it won't teach you how to disappear."
2,"quick read, dated material (pre Y2K hysteria)","I bought this out of curiosity to see what kind of ""privacy"" measures were being advocated. I'd say this is really geared to a narrow bandwith of people...the author appears to have a real survivalist mentality that's apparent in the many, many mentions of end-times/apocalypse/class wars that he foresees, and of course, in ensuring we know his stance on maintaining a personal arsenal. If you're looking for genuine advice on protecting your internet accounts and preventing identity theft, there's not much here. If, on the other hand, you're looking to jump bail or planning to flee the police, well...maybe there's something here, I suppose. Good for about an hour's reading, if that."
2,Sincere but badly dated,"This is an interesting book but more suited for a relic than a currenttome on privacy. It was written in the early 90's and the sections onusing pay phones(virtually non-existant today), cell phones ( in theirinfancy when this was written), and using Rural mail routes (now completely changed from box numbers that needed no house toreceive mail to requirements that 911 offices issue addresses based onexisting structures)make this book hopelessly outdated.The author, while quite obviously sincere, needs to update this bookregularly if it is to be sold as a serious reference work on privacy"
5,Great!,"This book is very helpfull with Diablo. The most helpfull thing about it is the shrine listings. This book also helps alot to get through the single player game very well. It list all of the items (even unique and enchanted) and lists their stats too. In short, this is a very helpfull book for playing Diablo."
2,It's got a great coverage of the single player but not multi,"while I loved it's explination of the quests and strategys for single player it's multi player strategys are far to complex and won't work unless everyone has them memerized sinse the majority of the time you spend on diablo is spent playing with other people and you really don't have the time or the patience to explain an entire strategy plan. most of the multiplayer strategys just don't work Great monster chart and shrine list but thats about all this book is, charts while they help a little bit but you could find just about all the stuff in this book on the internet. This book came with my copy of diablo but after reading it I would never spend money to buy it."
3,The guide to the start of the Diablo epic.,It really doesn't give me much more than I figured out on my own. You have to fend for yourself.
1,save your money,"Not impressed at all---can't handle any power. Save your money and buy some REAL tweeters.I might try them in my other car, but I will probably end up with the same though."
5,Yoga for SURFING,Loved the video - great for surfing shape - get's you more flexible for exactly the moves you need on your board.
3,I wanted to like this more than I did,"My wife and I did the ""Magically Hips"" routine first, which is very nice and has certainly helped loosen up my hips. However, Finn has a bad habit of interrupting a workout to show off.For instance, in the ""Strong, Free and Happy"" routine on the second DVD, he does this thing with his knees and his hands behind his back which I can't really figure out. It might be possible to figure it out if he didn't rush on to the advanced or intermediate versions (and apparently beyond). But he does. It might also be possible to figure out if the camera showed someone besides Finn doing it. But it doesn't. This sequence really destroys the mood for me--if the instructor in my first yoga class had gone in for that sort of thing I wouldn't practice yoga at all.We did get a good laugh out of the dog which shows up occasionally during some of the upward dog/downward dog sequences, and like I said I am really fond of ""Magically Hips."""
3,dispelled myths recycled,"This sounds like a very interesting book and I hope to find time to read it. i read a thoughtful review in German today (from the FAZ, 10 Oct 2001, page N3, by retired Physics Professor Martin Trömel) which I mention here because it is not likely to be read much in the USA. The title is roughly ""friends to the death: Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner; there was no lack of respect for the Jewish researcher; answer to a controversial theory.""Trömel finds it unfortunate that long-dispelled myths about Hahn and Meitner are repeated in this book and that selected quotes from German correspondence are used as evidence (and contradictory quotes from the same letters are omitted).Yes, there were misunderstandings, but these were often the result of distortions in the press and evidently Meitner and Hahn overcame them and remained friends to the end of their days."
1,it lasted a day,"My son got this toy last Christmas, he loved it and it was a lot of fun while it lasted, which was about one day. I was very disappointed, I expected a lot more from Chicco and for the price. The idea was very nice, because it was very easy for him to use, he was 2 then, but I will never buy another toy from Chicco again, the same thing happened to the car version from the same brand name he got too, and a friend of mine said the same thing happened to their son's motorcycle."
3,not a good fit,It's working but it's not really the correct belt for my Hoover. Said it was compatible but it's a bit tight and sometimes it slips but the vacuum is so old if it wears out too soon doesn't matter. The vacuum goes out with the belt to the trash.
4,IR penguin dictionary,"Almost full, really useful and clear. Good for specialized readers, might be a bit difficult for amateurs"
5,Ya'll are great,I really like ya'lls music. I try to get every single last one of ya'lls cd. I really like ya'll cause ya'll be jumpin off!!!
1,Threw mine away;,"see video comparing this to 4 other types. This is rough on the tongue and can't see what it is scraping,cleaning. Tongue pockets are not one size fits all. Rinse with every pass, too small. Makes a mess. Would not recommend for a pet. [...]"
5,SIMPLY THE BEST,THIS MOVIE IS ABSOLUTLEY WONDERFUL BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME WE THE FANS HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE WHAT REALLY WENT ON INSIDE THE VERY SECRET LIFE OF IKE AND TINA TURNER.
4,Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo,"Wow! When they cast Angela Basset to play Tina Turner, they made an amazing choice. She has Tina's facial expressions down pat and an amazing figure too! I never knew that Ike Turner was such a monster. Laurence Fishburne was amazing in his role, he was very scary, and it just made you hate Ike for being so evil. This movie shows what kind of person Tina is: strong. As a little Anna Mae Bullock, she was abandoned by her parents. She stood by her husband Ike, despite the fact that he did drugs, slept with other women and beat her. But enough is enough. Tina couldn't stand it any longer. She left Ike and finally got a divorce. Tina started to rebuild her career as a solo artist but it wasn't an easy job. After years of working and touring, finally in 1983 Tina hit the charts with the cover of Al Green's ""Let's Stay Together"". Tina made the greatest comeback ever. This is a perfect movie. Great story, great music, great performances."
4,A delightful book,This book has large vibrant pictures that can be readily seen by a group of children. I like to read it to kindergarten classes. The children love to say the refrain along with me.
4,Danceable and lotsa fun..,"BBB is a fun NYC band, both recorded and live... If you like Prima/Smith, you'll love this! ohh... and HiFi Honey is quite a looker! :)"
1,BORED TO TEARS,"My heavens, how could anyone enjoy this? I kept waiting for something to be interesting and it simply NEVER happened. I so enjoy most independent and foreign movies and this was just a bomb!"
5,Hauntingly Beautiful,"Karen Kevra and Paul Orgel are extraordinary musicians, who play with depth and maturity. The music has remarkable range, from quirky rhythms to atonal movements to lovely melodies."
2,"Long on Art, short on tutorial","I bought this book impressed by the variety of digital art reproduced within it. However, I also expected that there would be some helpful tutorials discussing how to achieve the effects in the artwork. While some tutorials are included, they are hardly of the helpful, step-by-step variety - the eager learner is given short-shrift and the tutorial explanations are very shallow and less-than-helpful. For those looking for some nice art to look at, certainly pick this book up. However, if you want a book to learn from, go somewhere else."
2,Just plain weird,"While witty and charming, this book still manages to be a disappointment. In her last two books, eventually, all the twisting plots came together and made sense. In this novel, they did not. Only because I chose to use this book for a project I was doing did I half-heartedly trudge through this book of nonsense. What happened to the yellow dog? What happened to Ferdinand? When I chose this book I was confident that it was not a sci-fi. Then why did so many supernatural things seem to happen? Now I'm stuck doing a report worth 15% of my grade on a book that does not make sense and basically, has no continuing plot. This book has certainly discuraged me from picking up another of Atikinson's novels."
3,It is a funny book,"I gave it a 3 because it IS a good read. It's not the best but still worth reading. I did find the characters to be engaging and amusing. Prof. Cousins is a hoot. The different plots/settings take time to get use to but you quickly understand that the ""real"" story is happening with Nora on the island. Overall, if you're looking for a deep, meaninful read I'd say this isn't it. If it's a quick funny book you're after, this is a decent choice. It seems as though Ms. Atkinson had a lot of good ideas, but just couldn't make them all gel together."
2,I really tried to like this book,"I like Kate Atkinson but I found this book irritating and exhausting. Unlike some commentors, I didn't find the first 20 pages difficult at all. I quite enjoyed some of the twists and turns, the distracting interruptions as characters popped in and out of the story, the several stories compressed into one. However, near the end, I just became tired. I could not care anymore about what happened to any of the characters and so, I did not finish reading it. I seldom give up on any book, reading dutifully to the end of far worse novels than this. But as the ending became more frenetic, more fantastic, more convoluted, I simply gave up. No matter what the ending was, it was no longer worth it."
2,Emotionally disappointing,"I thought that I would find a funny, entertaining and extremely neurotic story in this one. The first few chapters of Emotionally Weird were done very well. I was getting what I wanted: a satire of college life in the 1970's, but then it got irritating and trite. Unfortunately I found the series of stories and character anecdotes annoying and misguided. Yes, it is very funny. But the comedy does not make up for the ludicrous and confusing situations. I am not going to say that you shouldn't buy this book, although you should know what you're getting yourself into. In the end, you will either love or hate it."
1,A slog,"Based on my love for another Kate Atkinson novel, Case Histories, I thought Emotionally Weird would be a good read. To my disappointment, I ended up having to force myself through the book, hoping that at some point I would begin to like at least one of the characters in the novel. Instead, every character came off as slightly repulsive and one-dimensional, and I never gained an appreciation or sympathy for any of them. About halfway through the book, I began to feel like I was stuck in a Groundhog's Day scenerio, where every chapter seemed to repeat slightly modified descriptions of characters' weird clothing, drug-filled dorm room conversations revolving around Star Trek quotes, and excerpts from lame papers/novels being written by the students or their professors. My advice is to skip this one and try some of Kate Atkinson's other books instead."
3,not nearly as good as her first two,"kate atkinson is a funny, witty, woman. i saw her speak recently, and read from one of the chapters of this book, and it was highly enjoyable. i especially love the fact that she has a penchant for buffy the vampire slayer, and would love to write an episode... great stuff!unfortunatly, emotionally weird does not live up to her other 2 novels. it's funny, and clever, and enjoyable, but the ends don't meet as nicely at the end, and in her books, some tying up is necessary after you've been scattered all about.i would still say read this, but read her others first, they're better, and then, when you love her (and inevitably you will) read this one, you'll be hungry for more at that point, and while this isn't a full course meal it is a nice light snack!"
5,"A must purchase for the ""No Depression"" fan","I recently saw this band open a show in Minneapolis and immediately went out and bought the cd. This CD is in constant rotation with Uncle Tupelo and Sonvolt, it is that good!"
2,Very Unhappy Musician!!,"I purchased this toy for my daughter. Since my husband plays guitar, I thought it would be a cute idea to get my daughter a guitar, too. What a mistake! It worked for about 2 months and then the ""strings"" stopped playing the music. I thought I needed to change the batteries, that was not the case. After about 2 weeks, the top botton, which makes silly sounds stopped playing. It was useless. It was just a plastic guitar with no sounds! I just threw it away. It was such a waste of money!"
2,"Oh, well...","May be the worst possible interpretation of Shakespeare I have yet seen-- I'm almost certain that the director/screenwriter will wear this review as a badge of honor, it's that poorly done."
3,"Fight the future, play with the past!","I Want to Believe Review:Imagine if Gillian Anderson played Dr. Beverly Crusher on Star Trek: The Next Generation.Fight the Future Review:Imagine if David Duchovny played Jean Luc Picard on Star Trek: TNG.Obviously, the first movie is much better. Gillian Anderson would make a perfect Beverly Crusher and she'd be smoking hot. Could you imagine her calling out Wesley Crusher for thinking he was so bad when the Traveller wanted him?On the other hand, Duchovny could never play Picard. It just wouldn't work."
4,Only if you are X-philer,"I really don't want ""I Want To Believe"" in blu-ray but I do want ""Fight The Future"" but this is a good deal,to get both blu-ray movies for this low price.If they were seperate you're looking at least $45.00 for both on blu-ray.""I Want To Believe"" was worse of the worse stand alone,from the series-season 8 and 9 combined.If they had stuck to the alien or monster story,I think the movie would have done much better.Shame because it was good to see Mulder and Scully's character back on the big screen,it's just the story wasn't a good fit and it showed through the actors performance."
2,"Excessive vignetting with f2.8, take the full frame 17-35 f2.8-4 rather!","I returned this lens in fast succession as I saw the extent of vignetting, which it causes. Especially with f2.8 the problem is extreme with all focal length.You might verify this finding on several well known online sites, such as Photozone (dot de, not dot com!). The well known author of this site measures on a Nikon D200 whopping 1.4 steps darkening of the edge. He uses Norman Koren's Imatest software. Even on Canon it is still 1.0 step darkening (Canon uses a smaller sensor size, scale factor 1.6 versus Nikon's 1.5.)Do yourself a favor and take rather the quite excellent 17-35 f2.8 Di full 35mm frame! You will like your images much more, and you will be able to use the same lens with film bodies as well."
4,Iceland isn't that cold !!!,"It was funny to see Iceland and Icelanders shown in such a strange way. But the line that says it all is....""So, how do you like Iceland?"" I don't recomend it for someone who is planing to come to Iceland, but it's a funny and a diffrent comedy. Mostly Icelandic humor !"
2,Not that great,I read this book and I must say that I was very dissappointed in the end. It really had me going and kept me intrigued but the ending just messed it up. I thought it was so stupid. I would not reccomend this book to anyone just because of the ending.
4,A fun tour of 60's instro-pop tunes,"Most ""tribute"" albums focus on a single band's songs to cover. In this case, it's more of an era, or a style, or an attitude. If you grew up or lived through the 60's, these are songs that wormed their ways into your consciousness, even if you never knew the song titles or the bands playing them. They are, in effect, 60-'s pop versions of ""folk"" songs where the songs have survived even when the artists are long-forgotten. Take 15 of today's surfing bands, beginning with The Space Cossacks (who I currently rank #2 among all surf-music performers!) and you have a really FUN album on your hands!"
5,Sea Salt Smoother,Amazing! Makes my skin feel so smooth and nurished. I never get that itchy dry feeling when I use this. It doesn't feel too heavy either.
4,Type A cuality,I bought this product not to long ago and it is excellent. First the picture has a great cuality and last of all it is loaded with channels so i strongly recomened it. If you want to know more on this product look it up.
4,I think we played Delfina in the sectionals,"I grew up in a town halfway between Plymouth and Logansport, so it was a kick for me to see references to Tippy Valley, Marion, South Bend, Purdue, and other Northern Indiana places and ideas in this book, which is mostly very good. I gave this only four stars for two reasons: the farming scenes didn't hold my interest, and Annie's last name of ""Leroux"" isn't typical of that area of the country. Did her husband move in from Louisiana?"
4,Fabulous reading,I finished this book well over a year ago and still find myself ruminating upon its characters and images. I loved this book.
1,Bad quality - full of ads..few yoga sequences,"Im very disappointed by the quality of this DVD.According to the site, and itsy bitsy yoga class is about one hour long. This DVD the routines are barely 10min each. There are 3 routines consisting of about 4/5 postures. This is too few and very short yoga routines. In my view it is therefore overpriced.Plus the DVD menu is difficult to navigate and alot of adverts about joining itsy bitsy classes...Im cross I fell for the amazon advertising on this one!!!!"
3,not so good as I expected,"I bought this DVD to help creating some nice play with the baby, exercise and relax for me. However, when I put on the DVD, he is rather watching the Video than engaging the exercise with me. I can't really remember the poster myself, and keep watch the video as well.I tried a few times and decide to just play with him is much easier."
4,Pretty good cand concise but not enough to get you an 800,"I used this book to study for my SATII and read it twice, while i was enrolled in an AP euro class. I took world history class the year before (though not an AP). After reading it twice and taking the test, I got a 720.Good: concise review, covers most of the questions.Bad: questions at end of chapter arent helpful, not enough info to get you an 800, practice tests are much harder than the real thing, and the score scaling is curved way too much (although it may be that way because the tests are harder than normal). Also no maps whatsoever in the review section, although some in tests.According to the scaling chart, 12 wrong, 83 right is an 800, which was definitely not the case. I took my test in june, when people who took AP World History test were takin the SAT II, so there was probably less curve at that time of year."
2,Not Bad,"although the book contains good SAT II Level material, the questions at the ending of every chapter are very vague and unclear."
2,Careful.....,"Do you really think these are her EXACT recipes....??? I perused this book in the store and wasn't that impressed. I'm sure the recipes are good just like everyone says they are, but there simply are not enough recipes for me. I also prefer a separate cookie and dessert cookbook. Only half of the recipes in this book are cookie recipes."
4,Such a great Beginning to a Fantastic Trilogy!,"I loved this book because it kept you wanting for more, but it wasn't totally obsessive and time consuming. I was able to put it down and think about what just happened and then pick it up again to see what else was to enfold! Gemma is such an amazing character. She is just like so many young girls her age, eventhough this book was set in a totally different era. Libba Bray is a magical author and brings to life this new and exciting story!"
3,A Great and Terrible Beauty (Gemma Doyle #1) by Libba Bray,"I was first intrigued by the cover of the book and then when I started reading it the plot is what really kept me going. I made it through the book, however, I thought it was lacking in parts and the story kind of drug on, especially in the first part.The characters were not overly interesting and I disliked most of them. Pippa and Ann complained a great deal making them just annoying and hard to deal with; I would not want to be their friends. Gemma was the most genuine out of all of them.Overall it was not a bad story and did do a lot of credit to the strengths and independence of women."
5,Review of a Great and Terrible Beauty,"I absolutely adore this book! For the longest time my friends had been attempting to get me to read it and when I finally did, I couldn't believe I had put it off for so long. The story line is well put together and the characters are very easy to relate to and care for. The story is vivid and full of magic and it definitely leaves you wanting more! I highly recommend this book especially young teens and women. Very empowering!"
4,A Great and Terrible Beauty,"A sixteen year old girl named Gemma gets sent to Spence Academy in London after a tragedy happens to her family in India. Gemma has impeccable manners, only speaks when spoken to, and is prone to visions of the future that unfortunately come true. The only person who trys to help her, is a mysterious young man that tells her to keep her mind closed against these visions. At Spence Academy Gemma's gift to attract the supernatural unfolds, she gets mixed up with the most powerful girls in the school and discovers the surprising history and connection her mother had with a group called the Order."
4,A Great and Terrible Beauty,"16 year old Gemma has visions, that unfortunately come true, after a tragedy she is sent to a finishing school in London where her power really unfolds and she is told to close her mind to her visions.This book is pretty good, but sometimes can be stupid which is why its only 4 stars but otherwise its a pretty good book. But I'm not sure if I'll read the 2nd and 3rd books, they don't really interest me."
5,Great book,"The story of this 16 year old teenager was rich and vibrant. Being the 15 year old girl that I am, I could relate to the situations Gemma faced and I ceaselessly admired Gemmas all to rare strength of female character. This is a great coming of age tale intertwined with the dabblings in magic and fantasy which make the tale all that more alluring. When the story ends it undeniably leaves the reader to ponder the lessons taught and wondering if there will be a sequel. WILL there be a sequel because many things are left unfinished come the end of the novel."
4,From a Christian piont of veiw,"This was a well writen book. i couldnt put it down. But there where some things i didnt totally aprove of so i would not recomend it to young readers.I cannt wait to get the next book! I would suggest that u get the secound book as well, cuz the wait for the next book will drive u crazy."
2,Not what I expected,"About: This is a story about a girl who get's visions. She is desperate to go to Europe and have a 'normal life.' Well, she gets her wish. There she finds out about the truth about her family, the secrets, who she is, who her friends are, etc. Overall, the plot is intricate and twisty. I would not recommend to this to anyone younger than 13 - the vocabulary would be a bit too much.My Opinion : some thing about this just didn't intrigue me as much as a good book would. There was no magic while I was reading it. All the while, I was secretly hoping I would soon finish the book."
5,Absolutely Fabulous.,"Incredibly well-written, this Victorian/Gothic novel goes above and beyond any expectations you may have for it. Though it borderlines on cheesy/unbelievable at times (the job of a fantasy novel is to make you believe that which you normally would not), the dark, depthy material this book covers could not have found a better channel than the well-spoken Libba Bray.Well worth the read, beautiful cover. Five stars."
2,A Forced Finish,"This book bored the socks off me.And it was a strange thing because Bray has a wonderful grasp on prose. It was well-written in that sense. But as far as the story goes....it's what I call a ""platform book."" A platform book or movie is one which was solely created to push an agenda. In this case, girl power. Not to say I'm against girl power, I am a girl, but I'm against it feeling like the sole purpose of the book. The characters were cut-outs and uneventful. The romance, if it can be called that, was awkward and not at all enticing. I had the BIG SURPRISE PLOT TWIST figured out early on and once it was made known it took a lot of effort just not to abandon the book, but dang it, I paid ten bucks for that book to sit on my shelf and I was gonna finish it. Should've kept my money. I won't be buying the other books in this series."
2,Plodding,"I am very willing to read books for entertainment value only, not every book needs to be a literary masterpiece, but this book just fails in every way. The writing is flat and uninteresting, the characters are lifeless, and the story held less interest for me with every page. I know youth fiction isn't usually multilayered but I was able to predict the book's ending before I was halfway through. Also the setup for the next book was not subtle, it's more like the author took one book and chopped it into pieces to end up with a small series.However, from the number of positive reviews I am in the minority, so perhaps my opinion can, and should, be ignored."
2,2 1/2 stars- Nothing to get excited about,"I expected this book to be much better than it turned out to be- I guess it was just skillfully promoted. The plot holds much potential, but I found Libba Bray's writing style to be unremarkable and not very rich. I also thought that the whole premise of the book (the realms and the ""Order"") was ill-formed and without any deeper connection. The story just doesn't ""click"", somehow. It left me feeling dissatisfied.The lone unusual (and amusing) element of the book is the main character's (Gemma) quasi-love interest (Kartik). The hints of torrid romance were quite entertaining."
1,Horrible book,"I purchased this book for someone else online, and unfortunately I did not read enough about it, or I would never had purchased ""A Great and Terrible Beauty."" My friend received the order yesterday, delivered by post office and left in the rain. She told me she didn't think it was the kind of book she could read and certainly not pass on to anyone else. Today she told me about the little bit she did read and I regret she will have the memories of it in her mind. She definitely will throw it away. It is full of supernatural, demonic things and nothing anyone should dabble in if they want a sane mind. Also, it seems this author only wrote 2 books, and my friend said no wonder, given the nature of her writing."
3,Just Ok,This book is just Okay for me. I will probably read the sequels. I like the story. Sometimes I feel its a little rushed and really don't care for the present tense its written in.
2,Too much foreshadowing!,"I was kind of excited to get my hands on this book after reading the reviews, but was disappointed to find that it's really too immature for me. The foreshadowing ruins the book completely. It's predictable and only vaguely interesting."
4,a great read.,"i really really liked this book.the premise isn't something i would normally read, but i'm glad i did. the main character, gemma doyle, is really awesome. she is witty, and strong, but she also has tremendous flaws.kartik. i love him, he's so mysterious. he is isn't in the majority of the scenes, and when he is, they are very short, but i really can't wait to see what happens with him and his relationship with gemma in the next book of the trilogy.i felt like i could never really trust felicity at all while reading this book and i don't know if i really liked the friendship between gemma and the other three main characters. it seemed as if they only liked her because of her magical abilities. because the minute she told them she wouldn't bring them into the realms they turned on her. i suppose i'll have to see how their friendship plays out in the next book!"
2,A Disappointment,"I'd really like to read a book about scientific blunders, but this certainly isn't it. For the most part, it's a review not of scientific blunders but of commonplace mistaken notions of the past--the earth is flat, the earth is the center of the universe, alchemy, perpetual motion, and so on. All done very superficially, as if from an encyclopedia. I can imagine having a reason to refer to it sometime in the future, which is why it's not a total waste (and why I gave it two stars instead of one), but if I didn't already own it, I definitely wouldn't buy it."
1,Heaven forbid your's should ever need repair,"Mine did. When customer service finally found the unit lost in its repair facility, they were of little or no help in making it right. I have had to have it repaired three times in 6 months. Until I brought my attorney into it, Panasonic was slow to help."
4,Telephone Love on CD,"This CD contains one of the songs that started the Dancehall craze in America - ""Telephone Love"" by J.C. Lodge. This song was huge in the reggae clubs. That's why they created an entire album, ""Telephone Tracks"", from this backing track. A must have for anyone who likes the song ""Telephone Love"". Other great songs include...Josey Wales - Everyone Hustling, Lady G - Nuff Respect, Mighty Diamonds - Heavy Load and Home T - Single Life. Buy this now before it goes out of print. You won't be disappointed!"
4,Last Summer,I enjoyed reading this book. Once I started it was hard to put down. I would recommend this book to a friend.
4,Laughed AND Cringed - Enjoyed this Book Immensely,"I laughed out loud during the first half of a book - Strand can be a very funny writer, but by the second half I was laughing less and cringing more. He's an amazing writer, flawless execution keeping the action moving along quickly, and again the book is quite funny - especially in the dialogue - early on. But this is a horror novel, make no bones about it - not a spoof or satire of the genre. Some scenes were quite horrific and cringe-worthy as the puzzle the protagonist Andrew Mayhem is forced to solve gets more gruesome and the stakes get higher. I got pretty creeped out. It takes an artist to have such a dark tale while still managing to bring a laugh. Jeff Strand is a master at this."
3,Natural Stomach Care,"This book is a winner. Speaking as one who has suffered with stomach disorders for a decade, I can testify that the information is solid and easy to understand. In fact, it's the most pragmatic book I have ever seen on this subject."
5,Year of the Comet,"I love this film - pure escapist comedy with romance and love of wine starting with mad dash across Scotland (beautiful scenery) - a perhaps unlikely pairing of Penelope Ann Miller and Tim Daly (of TV's Wings fame) works surprisingly well and Louis Jordan as the villain is a charming addition (he never could sing). Not well received by the critics, but a great time and a must see for wine lovers everywhere!"
4,Wonderful Bible,"I first received this bible back in elementary school and have kept it until now, 15 years later. My little niece is starting to read the weather torn pages, so I recently bought one for her. The reference in the past review about Deuteronomy 18:12 was appalling. I understand that we all want to shield our children from certain facts or what not, but the verse in the Bible is accurate. I don't know about you, but I want my children to read the actual Bible (as I explain its context) rather than read one that strays from the truth."
2,"Some functions doesn't work well, poor quality","PictureIt/Digital Image Pro Ver. 9 was better quality software. Version 10 made improvements on automating some tasks but made other fundamental functions work really badly: If you apply Red Eye correction, most of times when trying to increase the effect to achieve a natural eye color, the software inserts like a Black ring around the eyes!! Also, the sharpen function works pretty, pretty bad!!I don't understand why releasing to market software with these kinds of bugs on features that are used the most? why if they were working perfectly on version 9?I returned this very expensive (""very poor"" price/performance) software to buy other program where all the editing functions work as they should!!"
3,It's hard to work with,I liked the older version better. I have a hard time making the projects I used to do easily.
3,Good but not what I was looking for,"This product is very good for what it does. I was very pleased with the purchase process and the seller's quick response. However, it turns out that it does not due everything that I thought it might."
2,Women are smarter than this,"I was disappointed in this book. It has a condescending tone, constantly comparing a car's engine to the kitchen. I found the assumption that all women must have a good understanding of the kitchen at best frustrating, since am no cook, and at worst, degrading. The author implies that male mechanics are hulking brutes, and that they intentionally invent words just to confuse us, like ""viscosity"" to describe the thickness of oil. The first time I encountered this word was in geology class, while studying the variety of lava flows. While the book does contain a good deal of useful information for car owners, it is delivered in such a manner as to make any intelligent woman wince, and I'm surprised the author's male colleagues aren't complaining."
2,First and last order,"First and last order with this vendor... the standard shipping rate was 35% of my total!!! ...and the shipping was SLOW. If this company wants to do business online then they should find better shipping options for their customers or stop trying to boost their profits by gouging customers on shipping costs. The product was of OK quality, but with the shipping it ends up being very over-priced. You suckered me once but, never again!"
4,If only they had animated the Revenge Arc...,"I gave it 4 stars only because I like Rurouni Kenshin. If you want the real continuation of the Kyoto Arc (Revenge Arc), read the manga translations volume 18-28 or wait until the second OVA comes out on DVD. These next few DVD's are too great."
3,Rurouni Kenshin Firefly wish,I was disapported. I thought that they could have done better on the last eposied. I love Kenshin but it wasn't what i thought it to be. I liked the one with sano and the dog and the first one to but still they could have more. Likr Kenshin thoughts after the first eposied and in the last one two.
2,Poorly built,"All four legs broke off in a matter of weeks. This cost far too much to brake that easily. I am very unsatisfied with it. It the legs were built to last longer it would be an excellent product. It was one of the few easels I could find that had a chalk board, dry erase board, spindle for rolls of paper to paint or draw, and was magnetic."
4,Fun for tots,"The only thing I can think of when looking at this is - MESSY!! But I have bought this for other people's tots and they love it. I don't know, with the warm weather coming up, this could become an outdoor activity. They can paint the birds and the trees and starry nighttime sky. But make sure you bring it inside after use, the wood frame will get warped from the weather. This easel comes with a roll of paper and easel clips but no paint and no drop cloth, which is an absolute must!Reviewed by[...]"
3,Disappointed in quality,"I ordered this easel several months ago in preparation for Christmas. I just opened the box to put it together. I found that the chalkboard was damaged on one corner,( Even though the package is pristine) the hinges are made of very flimsy metal which bent easily during assembly, and, there are not even enough of the right size screw to finish putting it together!. I am stuck with this incomplete, damaged toy. I am not happy."
3,Mediocre performance,I turned up the volume high and still had difficulty hearing all the songs. I thought also the costuming was lacking. I am comparing this performance of HMS Pinafore with the Dolly Cart performance in London. The performance of the Admiral was the best in this performance. He was quite short which added humor to his portrayal of higher rank in social order.
2,blah!,"this book's content was good enough, but it was writen rather sloppily and with no read order, that i could see anyway. the author attempts to lose us by using hard-to-follow words and phrases."
2,dissappointing sound,I was very dissapointed when I first played the dvd. I do not know if the disk was defective or not but I got very little sound out of the center channel. At first I thought maybe a setting was incorrect on my system but after playing it on both systems I have and playing other dvd's I knew played correctly still not center channel. Video quality good but without the true 5.1 sound I was very dissapointed.
5,This dvd is awesome. I love Journey,This dvd totally rocks. I think Steve Augeri does an awesome job. Journey made a great choice when the chose Steve Augeri for the lead singer. Rock on Journey!!!Julia
5,Activities Useful in Many Settings With Students,"Tom Jackson did such a good job with the activities presented in this book that I bought the second book without a second thought! Anyone working with young people in schools, churches or youth camps will find this book very helpful in planning activities that can take just minutes to prepare but are highly motivational to the youth you are teaching."
4,Thought Provoking Activities,Activities that teach has worked very well for us. We use the activities in our 4-H Club. Members age range is between 9 and 18. This book has provided activities that promote thought and sportsmanship. The members have enjoyed working through the activities.
3,A woman ahead of her time,"In her Utopian novel Herland, written in 1915, Charlotte Perkins Gilman anticipates many of the problems of the 20th century, from pollution to over-population. Essentially a work of science fiction, the novel portrays a culture developed in isolation that has focused on principles of love, sharing, nuturing, reason and continuous improvement. While not great literature, Herland offers fascinating insights into a rational approach to designing a society. The Signet Classic edition also contains 20 intriguing short stories written from a feminist perspective. This is the book I will be giving at the holidays! It deserves a wider audience."
1,deadly stuff,"i agree with the first reviewer, and ontop of what she said.. cedar and pine is toxic to rodents and results in liver failure and deadly respiratory problems.. dont kill your babies by buying anything like this stuff"
3,Family Values ~ East Versus West,"'Bollywood Hollywood' is a relatively enjoyable comedy/romance that pokes fun at both East and West cultural differences in a lighted-hearted, unoffensive manner. This Canadian production stars Rahul Khanna as Rahul and the very lovely Lisa Ray (who recently co-starred in the Bollywood murder/mystery 'Kasoor' - Hindi with English subtitles), as his love interest Sue.Nothing new or original here. Wealthy Indian family living in Hollywood want there son Rahul to wed. He pretends to be engaged to a nice Indian girl in an attempt to get his parents off his back. As expected real emotions soon arise between the two and before long ""love is in the air.""Good for at least one viewing. Repeat screenings, I don't think so. If nothing else watching Lisa Ray on-screen is a nice way to while away the time."
4,ESV is better,"The HCSB is a fairly literal translation, but its prose style is very awkward - I'd guess that it was translated directly from the original languages with no input from English stylists at all. It's even more clumsy than the NASB and NKJV, if that's possible. So I give it high marks for accuracy, but I don't think this translation is needed or will find a market niche. Those who want a literal Bible would do better with the NASB; those who want literary quality would do better with the ESV. New Christians who need an easy-reading Bible - which the HCSB is not - would be better off with the NIV. There simply isn't a category of reader that would be best served by this Bible. Good intentions aside, this project was ill-conceived and is poorly positioned in the marketplace."
4,Excellent new translation,"I have been looking forward to the release of the complete HCSB since I first heard about it. This translation promises accuracy and readablility. I am happy to report that it succeeds at both.The text is formal without being ""wooden"" and readable without being overly interpretive. It attempts to strike a balance between a Formal Equivalence (word-for-word) and a Dynamic Equivalence (thought-for-thought) translation. It seems to do this very well.This is the first edition of this complete translation. It is a simply hardcover binding ahd will likely not stand up to much intensive use. In fact the overall quality of this edition is somewhat poor. However, the price is reflective of this.This new translation makes use of excellent scholarship and I would recommend this to anyone interested in a new Bible."
2,Doesn't fit well,"It's kind of adjustable and because I sew (a little) I think I can actually make this work for me. There are no directions with it and it would be nice to see how it's expected to fit & look on a real person because we can't figure it out. I also wish it didn't have the clip holder or at least let me take it off when I want to and wear it without it. Like I said, I'll make some adjustments like that on it myself. It is of good quality and a good price though."
5,Awesome holster,"I bought this, a helmet and a leg holster, thinking, wow its cheap and i bet it is cheap. It's great quality stuff. It looks better than the image itself."
2,Ummmm.....,"I might be an idiot, but maybe this thing should have come with some instructions on how to put it on! Haha. So many velcro straps and what not. Neither me nor my father who's been on the police force for 30 some odd years could figure out how to put this thing on properly. Again....maybe I'm just an idiot....."
2,Clarity problem in explanation of equations,"This book looks and IS good when it comes down to going through complicated optical gain calculations. However, I feel the book expects reader to know important and advanced fundamentals of lasers which it does not go through in the book and may prove disadvantage to both advanced and beginner researchers interested in semiconductor lasers. The book includes many complex equations but they are, in my opinion, not explicitly explained in the text. In addition, what I found most disappointing about the book is that there were no examples to demonstrate gain calculations on any material (like GaAs-AlGaAs etc), which would really help in modeling a quantum well structure."
3,A Good Guitar,"I got this guitar about 2 years ago it is my first guitar and I must say its very good, the sound is really good I can play the songs I like and the sound is very accurately and looks cool also. Now, the bad things. Its pretty HEAVY, your gonna need a good strap because if you play this for a long time stand up it can be painful, also, my E string (the thicker one) gets buzzing a lot when the string has a while of been placed. But in general its a pretty good guitar, although I think its Not good choice for your first guitar because of having 24 frets."
3,The Washburn X10,"I got this guitar about a year ago at christmas. At first I was pretty excited about it, it was my first guitar and I loved it. After a year of playing, I still don't have any real complaints about it. The previous person to review this guitar was right, it is very heavy! If you're going to be jammin with some friends then you're going to want a very comfortable strap to hold it with, otherwise your body's going to be a little sore. As far as the playing goes, it plays very nice compared to some of my friends' guitars. Another con of the guitar, is that the string saddle is sharp on the high E string on mine, so after about 2 weeks of having the same strings on, the high E starts buzzing/ringing when you hit it.Nice finish, easy to adjust to, but 24 frets probably isn't a good place to start out...Overall a 3 of 5... pretty good for beginners, and sounds awesome for the price."
1,very poor,"it is a real pitty that the amazon editors didn't choose to publish the whole of Bickerton's review -- there we would, for example, see that Bickerton actually hopes ""for a sequel"" in order to have the book actually says something one could appreciate. this title certainly doesn't do justice to Verdery's otherwise excellent academic record. it is written in haste, with a complete lack of attention and needed careful reading of details. at the end we get an impression that she is making fun of other people's misery. it was obviously a too difficult task for her aims: the analysis is highly superficial, as if she aspired more to amuse than really teach. but dead bodies is something I find difficult to laugh about, no matter how pathetic the circumstances of their manipulations are."
5,Beyond 101... finally,"Telesco has written one of the few books I've found that treats me like someone who has an understanding of the craft and is ready to move on. So many books waste space covering Wicca 101 that they're not worth buying. This one assumes I already know what I'm doing and am ready to move forward.One of the main reasons I bought it was b/c it's a a looser guide and not a strict ""how to"" book. It builds on my basic knowledge and never talks down to me. Not as much fun as Telesco's ""bad witch"" book, but certainly a worth addition to any witch's library regardless of where you find yourself on the path."
5,Crack the Whip,The moral teaching of the Pope can seem very strict. This book explains the theories of freedom and law behind the hard sayings. This is a good case for the beauty and the power of the Pope's teahing.
4,Well written intro to the Mathematica product,"This book is a good high-level introduction to Mathematica's major built-in capabilities. If you read this book you'll get a good idea of what Mathematica can do without much programming. Of course you can write programs in Mathematica, too, but this book only gives a brief discussion of that. This book also doesn't go into the rigorous details of Mathematica's evaluation mechanism (term rewriting). This book is certainly not a very thorough reference for writing computer algebra algorithms in Mathematica. Luckily, there are other books out there to round out your Mathematica knowledge, if you need them: look for the books by Trott, Shifrin, and Mangano."
1,coarse workmanship,"I was really dispointed when I received this pendant.How can it make in such a way?the serface is coarse and the back is full of black glue.Though it is in good design, but it is not looks like the picture."
5,Great pendant,"This is a great pendant - I've gotten a lot of compliments on it. I did notice, though, that the stones are very uniform (no variation in color, and no bits of darker color (like black) that you normally see in red coral). The red is brighter than what I see in the image on my monitor, but it is a very nice red."
1,VFO Drifts Badly,"I converted mine to a Crystal controlled receiver, but onlysince I had the parts on hand. I may rebuild a new VFO later.The VFO drifted so bad that it was nearly unusable."
2,project 8 = upseting,"when I first heard about the new tony hawk game I thought i would be better thaen the others. unfortunaly I was wrong, this game is not worth the money. there are tons of glitches where u get stuck places and you have to restart. u cant do flips of run up walls like american wasteland. you also have to go thre levels that are very small and are boring. listin to me, buy american wasteland, it is such a better game or for 50 bucks u could buy a game that is not worth playing. the only thing that got better was when its loading it shows skate videos."
5,Great Comedy,"If your looking for a great comedy cd , then buy this. Emo is at his best here. One of the best I have ever heard."
1,3rd rate documentary,"Avoid this poorly made documentary. In 1981 Warner Brother released a film produced by David L. Wolper staring Orson Welles called, ""The Man Who Saw Tomorrow."" Unfortunately this film is not available on DVD and in currently out of print on VHS. ""Nostradamus: His Life and Prophecies"" is a dubbed and edited version of, ""The Man Who Saw Tomorrow."" Orson Welles has been removed. The footage by David L. Wolper has also been removed. The moody and spooky atmosphere is gone. What a pity! To make matters worse the producers of this DVD used a poor quality copy of, ""The Man Who Saw Tomorrow"" the color is faded and the picture is out of focus. Track down and buy, ""The Man Who Saw Tomorrow"" it's worth it."
3,"Oops, not the latest version by far","I thought that this was the most current version of the book but it is not, so I'm kind of disappointed. Other than that, it arrived quickly and in great condition. For that, I'm thankful."
1,Forwant of a lesser rating,"This is actually the worst for dummies book I've ever read: the author must think that her readership are really dummies. And I also find that the editors are at fault here too. Don't you have any kind of quality control for this franchise? Really, this book is a waste of time and money. I was half-way thru and I haven't learned anything useful. She even has pet words and phrases that are really irritating, esp. if you encounter them at every other paragraph. I've already read the 6th edition and I'm still upset that I have to suffer thru the worthless 5th edition. I'm still bracing myself for the 7th edition. I hope it's a much improved product."
5,Excellent resource! Was exactly what I was looking for!,"As an online investor beginner I found this book packed full of information and resources. This book is exactly what I needed. From the basic fundamentals to trading and tracking, it's all there. Worth the price paid just for the dozens of links and references to online info. (and I haven't even opened the CD which comes with the book)....Great buy!"
1,Sticky Gooey unusable pen,I have an old Sensa pen I bought close to 15 years ago that I love. When I found out Sensa pens weren't being made any more and I saw these on Amazon for such a low price I ordered 2. When I received them they both seemed to be leaking a gooey substance from the gel grip. I couldn't wash this substance off of the pens and it made the pens unusable. There is no stickiness at all to my old Sensa. I returned them both for a refund from Amazon. At least Amazon returns are easy!
3,Sweet.,"I've never heard anything else from these guys, but their cover of ""Strawberry Fields"" is pretty good. It roughly keeps the vibe of the original, but puts an electronica spin on it. Nothing mind-blowing, but nice to hear this song in another way, while still being mid-tempo and a bit psychedelic. Pick it up if it's your favorite Beatles song, or if you find it used."
1,I got WRINKLES from this thing....,"I have slightly oily skin and sometimes it peels during the winter. So I figured I would give this ""gentle"" exfoliant a chance. Well let me tell you, it definitely did exfoliate but it made my skin SO DRY that within 2 weeks of using it, I started to realize I began having very light minor WRINKLES. WRINKLES!!!!!!!! I'm 20 years old!!! I was horrified when I noticed 2 weeks later and stopped using this immediately!So if you have dry, peeling skin, do not use this product. It'll only take away all those essential oils that keep your skin looking young and fresh."
5,A True G Movie...even though it's rated PG.,"Wow, I thought movies like these weren't made anymore (Totally Wholesome).....and I'm just 35 yrs old. I saw this movie with my 6 1/2 year old daughter, we both enjoyed it.There is no refrence to sex or drugs and there is absolutly no cursing.... how great is that. The movie is suprisingly good, a nice family movie."
1,What is wrong with you people the movie is bad!,"I know that everyone is sayin that this movie is great but in my opinion it's really not. I watched it the other day and it's horrible. I do think Kenan Thompson is hilarious but not in this film I don't. This movie really does suck. The acting is terrible, the soundtrack is okay I guess but I just didn't really like the movie much. What a waste of time to watch for a hour and a half but please don't bother seeing it. I just thought it was the worst Bill Cosby movie ever made."
2,"Pleaser, Please!","Cute shoe and the price was great but they looked cheap. I am normally a 7.5, I ordered the 8 because 1/2 sizes weren't available. It turns out they were too big. My feet were practically sliding out of the shoe. I returned them. You get what you pay for."
1,Terrible Print Quality,"I havent read the book yet, but as I pulled it out of the box it was evident that the publisher that printed this book made photocopies of the original and used those for the press. The front cover and text seem a bit fuzzy. For $10 I am not going to bother returning it as I do have to read it, but I am very dissapointed in the quality."
5,"A tried and true approach to life, free of gimmicks and fluff","This book, takes excerpts from the writings of a sixteenth century Dominican. If you can, read the books that these sections were taken from, and read them in the original. If you want a quick introduction into Ven. Luis de Granada's thought though, this is the book for it. The chapters are short and nicely lay out a framework for living a virtuous Christian life. Granada's thought is always straightforward and easy to grasp. Fr. Jordan Aumann, OP is one of Fray Luis' main translators into English. With this book he does a good job not only with the translation, but also the selection of relevant excerpts."
2,Poor quality,"Item is not what I expected.I probably should have known better going by the price, but for that I could have gotten somethinng a lot better at any shoe store in my area."
3,Larry Cohen Fun Thriller,"Larry Cohen is an interesting filmmaker. He directed the It's Alive trilogy (mutant killer baby),Q: The Winged Serpent (low budget giant monster classic),The Stuff and wrote screenplays for William Lustig (Maniac Cop,Maniac Cop 2,Uncle Sam). The Ambulance stars Eric Roberts (The Expendables,The Immortals) as a Marvel Comics artist who falls for a beautiful woman who disappears after passing out on the street. it's a quirky take on the detective film where Roberts character attempts to discover what happened. James Earl Jones (voice of Darth Vader,Conan the Barbarian) has an entertaining roll as the detective Roberts deals with."
3,"Not the best Italian horror, not bad either","If you are a fan of Italian horror- this film has an interesting angle and some clever plot twists. Unfortunately, the images and action do not wrap you up (Or make you laugh; depending) in the way other greats like: The Beyond, Tenebrae, The House With Laughing Windows, Blood and Black Lace, Opera, and others do. This one is more of a rental than a purchase.If you are not an Italian horror fan- you will probably hate this film."
4,Good resource,"This book is a very good resource for all aspects of emotional healing. The author's writing style is engaging and his descriptions are clear. If you are building a library of resources for homeopathy, this book is a great addition."
3,"Well-written, but...","This was a well-written and somewhat interesting book, but I just could not relate that well to it, meaning that I could not identify with the people involved. Maybe I've read too many ""adventure"" books lately or something. I don't know. I just had a problem liking the people involved and so found myself not really concerned about continuing the book at times.Really, there is not anything wrong with the book. The author does a good job telling us what happened and what is going on and such. I just didn't find myself being pulled into the situation.I didn't dislike the book, but I didn't really like it either. So I gave it a three star rating."
3,Very Cool,"These are the only shot glasses I could find featuring Freddy so not much selection out there. They are very cool but be prepared that they are made of plastic material, not glass. Glad that I bought them, I'm a huge fan of the films!"
2,poor transmission gel,"This product is a very poor transmission gel and for the most part as a coupling agent it was useless! As a health professional, finding ultrasound gel sometimes can be hard, especially for a price like this one."
2,Can use KY instead,I didn't know at the time when I purchased the doppler that I could use KY Jelly instead of purchasing this bottle of u/s gel.
5,Very smooth!,"Love these! Compared to the Tinkle ones I used, which would nick and cut my skin all the time, these are very smooth and provide a close shave. They are so smooth in fact that when I first tried them on the chin and eyebrows I didn't feel a thing. I wondered if they even trimmed anything but when I looked the small hairs I had trouble tweezing were gone! I use these on my legs too since I have super sensitive skin and can't use traditional leg shavers or waxing. Great product! I will keep ordering these in the future."
5,Not easy but valuable reading,"I had problems with arranging ""work life"" with ""faith life"" and my wife surprised me with this book. This is a heavy bomber as it gives you advice on every possible level of management, from people management to investments and product strategy, with real-life examples. I like that they don't try to sell the Christian management as a joker which will work at least as good as the 'classic' economics principles. They're very realistic.And special thanks that I got what I read it for: how to be a Christian manager and how to lead people. And even more.If you need an easy reading, skip this book. It's not that. It's roughly a college textbook in terms of style and structure, but a tad better to read."
4,I LUV THIS THING!!!,"BUT; U KANT TAKE THE DVDs U'VE RECORDED ON THE SONY RDR-GX7 AND EDIT THEM IN YOUR PC. I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE I'M USING THE WRONG SOFTWARE. MAYBE I'LL TRY ADOBE LIVE MOTION INSTEAD OF SONIC'S MyDVD SOFTWARE THAT CAME WITH MY SONY DRU-500A RW DRIVE IN MY PC. BUT EVEN WITH THIS LITTLE DRAWBACK, I JUST LUV THIS THING. I RECORD THREE SHOWS OFF OF TVLAND EVERYDAY WHICH IN TOTAL IS THREE HOURS LONG. I RECORD THEM EACH IN LP MODE AND MY PICTURE QUALITY STILL SEEMS HARDLY SACRAFICED. I BOUGHT IT IN MAY-2004 FOR $498. IT SURE BEAT THE $799 PRICE TAG SONY HAD ON IT AT THEIR OWN WEBSITE. I WOULDN'T TRADE THIS THING FA NUTTN!!!"
3,"Great suction, but not so great for bare floors.","As a couple reviewers noted, I can confirm that on bare floors the vacuum tends to kick things into your legs. If I walk barefoot, I can feel little grains all over where I just vacuumed. The suction seems great, though.I think the culprit may be the over enthusiastic roller brush. I've tried all the height settings and it's just not working out.This will probably be great if you have carpet. For bare floors, stick with a swiffer."
1,Is this for real?,"I don't know if this book is supposed to be a joke or what, but I was a little scared to see that some people are taking the advice. This book contradicts basic health and sanity. If you want to live a life that revolves around a scale and can only make you unhappy, then read this book and make yourself some soup with ketchup. If, on the other hand, you DO want to be happy, read ""Intuitive Eating"" (look it up here). I came across this book a year ago while I was looking for something like ""The Skinny"" and it changed my life forever. I eat whatever I want, whenever I want - and at 105 lbs, I AM SKINNY!"
4,Touching,"I saw this movie when originally came out in 1992, and thought it was wonderfully done. It takes the story of someone who knows abject lonliness and how he uses food for a comfort, and how someone, a certain someone, can make a difference and help them see the change that they need to do, to be a better them. Not a big Seinfeld fan, but thought the Jason Alexander showed he was the cream of that crop in this performance."
2,Disappointed - gift was open,I just received this product - the tape on the box was open and the box was torn apart. It was obvious someone had received this and returned it. Since it's a Christmas gift for my son I went ahead and taped the box shut and tried to repackage the product. It will be interesting to see if it actually works.
1,Low Quality,This product would be great if the threading on the connector that goes to the pump was inspected. The threading was half encased in plastic rendering this toy useless.
3,Fun Rocket; needs to be better built,Rocket pressure canister does not hold the air very well. My kids had a great time with it but it didn't even shoot the higher pressure launches when we bought it.
4,An Engaging Look At The Independent Film Scene In The Mid-Nineties,"Simple and straightforward, 1997's ""Lavender Limelight"" is a brief series of interviews with seven prominent lesbian filmmakers of that era. Each lady spends about seven to eight minutes discussing their art and films in detail. I found the presentation informative and entertaining, and for a feature that lasted less than an hour--it was a decent portrait at the process and thought that drives independent cinema. The fact that the participants were lesbians was secondary to the fact that they were artists creating personal stories. Perhaps the most notable inclusions were Maria Maggenti (The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love), Cheryl Dunye (The Watermelon Woman), Rose Troche (Go Fish) and Jennie Livingston (Paris is Burning). However, this piece was shot in 1997 and so it lacks the contemporary commentary on what is going on in the film world today. KGHarris, 10/11."
3,Cute book BUT it really stinks!,"This book is really cute and informative as it uses the correct terms for the different positions. However, this book has a really noxious odor! You could smell it even before the box was opened. I have a headache just from looking at the book. I am almost afraid to give it to my granddaughter! Hopefully it will go away from being out in the open. This is the reason that I only gave it 3 stars."
1,Maybe I got a bad batch,After reading the other reviews for this product I thought I would probably be very happy with this product. After using it on my hands for about two weeks it seemed as if the skin on my hands looked older. The brown spots were much more pronounced and the skin looked much drier and more wrinkled. I was very surprised given the other reviews but maybe I just got a bad batch. At the price of $16 I don't think I will be giving this another try. I have started using Jergens Ultra Healing lotion which is working quite well in making my hands look younger.
1,Not worth the time or the money,"If you want to learn about D&D;, get the 3 official books. There's NOTHING in this Dummy book that you can not learn better in the real ones. It is repetitive, over-simplified and not even entertaining.This thing is just the rushed product of a franchise (the books for Dummies). A real rip-off. Not worth your time or your money."
5,BEAUTIFUL and PERFECT CONDITION,"Thnaks for the great dinnerware set, we love it and it came in extra careful packaging and was super safe and in-time for the holiday order i was hoping for. couldn;t be more pleased."
4,Churchill China,"I love the set. It is not from England but Columbia.When delivered it had a broken saucer,cracked tea cup and a few chips in other dishes. Don't want to send the whole thing back."
4,Quite Hard to Figure out ..,"I truly dont know what exactly to say , But i do really want to warn everyoneSome people say this is Quite An amazing product and that the hamster love to make bidding with it Although theres some people who says this suffocates your hamster therfore i truly never understood the concept of this product , And it does somewhat resemblence the dryer lint , But trust me it's Not anyway i'd like to state also that this is better than the coconut bedding , Coz coconut nesting actually is very bad to hamsters and every hamster owner should know that ! And on other side i'd say maybe you should give it a try but be very careful with your pets and watch their progress with this product , IT may become their favourite toys ! Just love your pets .. They only stick around for like 3 years ? So make it their best 3 years ! Please trust me they do understand love .. And love is The smartest feeling we've ever experienced !"
3,It is a BB tool but...,does the job ok but Park BBT9 worked better for me because it has piece at the end to remove crankarms
5,Moving NDE and Visionary Memoir,"I greatly enjoy NDE books that take me inside the writer's life. Any NDE writer that paints a vivid picture of her Near Death Experience, and gives me a sense of what it is like to be that person having that experience -- that is the writer who keeps me turning pages until the wee hours of the morning. And I do enjoy my guilty pleasures.Peg Abernathy is one of those writers who has the gift of bringing her experiences to life on the page. Whether it is her years as a struggling country singer, her Near Death Experience, her ongoing dialogues with her Guides in the Temple, or her voyage to the Crystal City, each word, each spiritual being she is in contact with shines not only with Light but with reality and individual presence. And her struggles to come to terms with her new post-NDE gifts are deeply moving.This is an unforgettable book."
2,Not so good,"I purchased the cable because I heard that the video using component cable is better than S video. However, to my disapointment, I found the video better on S video than component cable. It could the cable, I do not know!!."
4,Very Nice for the Price,This set of cables performs at a great level. It's a very good price vs. value item. If you are looking for a Component Cable that performs and that is price accesible this is your choice.
4,Really very good - one of the best songwriters around.,This is really very good. I wanted a Billy Bragg CD having heard a few songs over the years on the radio. I chose this one on the basis of the www.amazon.com comments and can thoroughly recommend it. A talented songwriter and competent performer.
1,Wrong title for your poster,"It's not ""Gastly Crumb Tinies;"" it's ""Gashlycrumb Tinies."" Big difference when it comes to Edward Gorey. You should get the title right if you're selling the poster."
1,This DVD is in PAL format,"Even though it explicitly states near the top of this page that this DVD is in NTSC format, it is not. It is in PAL format, which does not play at all on most DVD players/televisions in the United States."
5,watch out Hollywood! Lagaan is real movie making,"There are few good period, epic movies made by Hollywood. Lagaan is reminiscient of the greats. The story is easy to follow, uplifting and inspiring, & the cricket match is a nail-chewer. The details and the camera work are so intricate. The acting is supurb. The musical numbers are a delight!!!"
5,simply amazing!!!!!!!,"i never thought that such a long movie would ever be able to keep me engrossed but this movie can be described in a few words alone!!!!!!! SIMPLY AMAZING!!!!!A PERFECT MOVIE WITH A CORRECT BLEND OF JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING!!!!!LOVE,CRICKET,JEALOUSY,HAPPINESS,SADNESS,SOULFUL MUSIC,LOVELY KATHAK DANCES.I loved it and so will everyone else!!!!ENJOY!!!."
1,DVD Does not work!,"Do not buy a copy of this from ""Stuff from India""! Mine is in a format that does not play on my DVD players and I can't get subtitles to work on my computer. I am not sure if this was the fault of the seller or not but it is false advertising to list this DVD as one that will play on U. S. DVD players. This was a complete waste of my money. I found out too late to return it and left a 5 star review of the seller online as I did not get around to watching it right away and wanted to leave a review. My review was based on the speed of shipment only. Amazon needs to update its description of this movie to indicate it is in a format that won't play on U. S. DVD players. Apparently I am not the only one that was burned on this."
5,An unexpected pleasure,"As a general rule I do not watch foreign films. I rented this film and did not know that most of its dialogue is not in English. As I watched it I figured that I would just turn it off when it became uninteresting.The story grabbed me and held fast. I can't believe that I watched and enjoyed a foreign language film that was almost four hour long. It was wonderful.I will not say anything about the film's plot, as I like it to unfold before me, but I will say that it is about arrogance of the oppressors, and about a fight for life for the oppressed. This film also has a couple of delightful love stories.There is no way that I can convey how much I enjoyed this film. It was great."
5,Best movie to come out of Bollywood yet !,"It is very rare that I feel proud about a movie from Bollywood. This is one of those movies. The feeling you get after watching this movie is simply great !If you are used to watch regular Hindi movies, you are in for a big (and pleasant) surprise! It defies all the formulae of a typical hindi movie and sets a new standard. It is a world class product showcasing core indian values. Bollywood should be thankful to the 'LAGAAN' team for showing them a new horizon.It scores big in all departments of filmmaking. Ashutosh Gowarikar and Aamir Khan deserve all the praise they are getting for visualising and producing such a project. A R Rahman delivers one of the best musical scores of his career.You HAVE to see this movie in a theater. You have to see it with your friends and family and be a part of this wonderful experience. Well, if you can't, next best thing is this DVD."
3,Not the easiest or fastest to use,"I purchased this flash drive for its large storage capacity and security feature. Overall it works ok enough, but it doesn't stand out from the crowd of other flash drives and has a couple of features which I'm not crazy about:1. It isn't Hi-Speed USB (USB 2.0).2. The security program requires that you install a program onto your computer before use. This is different from the Diskonkey drive which allows you to run the security program without installing it first.The Diskonkey is much more expensive, though, so the Lexar is better for the budget-minded."
3,JUNGLE FUN,"BY ISSUE TWENTY OF THIS COMIC RISING SUPERSTAR ARTIST JIM LEE HAD LEFT GOING ON TOO THE X MEN, LEAVING CARL POTTS STILL WRITING THE VIGILANTE PUNISHERS STORIES AND GOOD THAT THEY ARE AND IT HAS TOO BE SAID THAT REPLACMENT ARTIST TOD SMITH IS NOT BAD(HE USED TO DRAW D C 'S THE VIGILANTE SERIES SO NICE TO HIM TO CROSS OVER TO MARVEL)ITS JUST COMPARED TO MR LEE, HES WELL......ANY WAY (PUNISHER) FRANK CASTLE IS ON HOLIDAY AND OF COURSE RUNS IN TOO ALL KINDS OF TROUBLE IN THE JUNGLE INVOLING THE USUAL CRIMS..... CARL POTTS IS A WRITER OF THE PUNISHER THAT TENDS TO GET FORGOT ABOUT BUT HE GIVE THE FANS THE KIND OF STORIES THEY LIKED SIMPLE AND FULL OF ACTION AND LETS BE FRANK ABOUT IT(NO PUN INTENDED!! HA HA)THATS WHAT WE LIKE...."
2,maybe I'm the only one...,"...but this cd drives me crazy. I just can't stomach the schoolmarmy tone. The songs are the best part. When my little girl gets her own cd player, I'll bring this one back out and she can listen to it in her room."
2,dont buy this....buy her other cd ...fun spanish!!!!,"i got ""fun spanish cd"" first and my kids and i fell in love with it......i they purchased all beth manner cd's!!!!!!!trust me nothing compares to her cd ""FUN SPANISH""!!! this one about magic spanish is BORING and lots of similar words to other cds!!! this one does not have enough songs and the kids hate it!!!!!! they keep asking for fun spanish which i love also........do NOT recommend this!"
5,Excellent,"I think that this tape is a great way to learn Spanish. Beth Manners put a lot of effort into this tape. The tape is not at all boring, and everybody on it is very enthusiastic. I highly recommend that you buy this CD, because it is a great way to learn Spanish."
4,Good for its price..,I bought this for my mother and she had a manuel crank ice crusher earlier. And this is an amazing upgrade for that. It crushes the ice like nothing. Fast and easy. Just must be patient with it and stick the cubes in one at a time. It's much better than the crank and is overall very pleasing....:-)
5,A Good Upgrade!,"I bought this ice crusher when my previous Deni broke. It is quieter, more powerful and a good upgrade. I can put in up to 6 smallish ice cubes and it takes care of them, no problem. I just wish they hadn't changed the on off button, the one on the previous model was better. The switch is awkward. But overall it is a great little machine!"
4,Great little ice crusher,"It works good, but you would not want it for a party! It is a little bit noisy and you have to feed in one ice cube at a time, but it is only my wife and I and she usually drinks wine and I have a soda or margarita, so it is great for a margarita or a snow cone for one of the grand kids."
4,Well made,It crushes ice very well but only one cube at a time. I didn't realize this when I ordered it. It is well made and looks nice on the counter.
2,Not durable enough for frequent use,"This product out of the box was excellent. It is extremely noisy but that's to be expected I guess. However, after just one year a plastic part broke off from somewhere inside and it's not been able to properly crush ice since. There's no way to get into the unit to check it out or clean it either. I would recommend it for infrequent use, but not if you like crushed ice with your drinks daily."
4,ice crusher,This is a small ice crusher suitable for preparing small amounts of crushed ice. It crushes one ice cube at a time into a plastic bin. I use it to make crushed ice for milkshakes. It works very well for that purpose.
4,Riveting Story,I remember reading the book years ago and this brought all those memories back. Incredible story of survival and determination.
4,"Fantastic, just a bit long","I thought this movie was great. It's a fantastic story, well told. It just should have been a half an hour shorter."
4,Good Game - Game card is a little tricky to enter in the website,"This is a fun MMORG to play. I prefer it to Guild Wars, but had to get use paying a monthly fee. This card makes it a little easier for me (I can get a few cards at once). It is a little tricky to enter the code in the turbine website. The link to enter the code is in a pretty small font and it is too easy to confuse it with place to enter the product key.Have fun and enjoy."
4,Good at the price.,"When these were on TV , I watched them and recorded them all the first year.Loved them.The price for these collections is high.At $28 I bought immediately.The commentaries are good , but I could look them up on Wikipedia."
4,Young Indianas Jones Part 3,When I got the Young Indiana Jones it was cool to rediscovered old the show with bonus features. I plan to share it with others.
2,These prices are insane!!!,"The show is a decent show, not the best, but alright. But, $79 for 12 discs, then I pay $78 for 9 (3 less discs) and now I have to pay $98 for 10 discs...give me a break. Plus they are not on HD or Blue Ray (like the 2 diff versions of the Original Star Wars movies and the Prequals)...so you MAY end up bying these again if you truly like them. Again not a bad product, but Lucas needs to get less greedy on his merchandise!!!"
2,Too short,"Very disappointing. This DVD is only 30 minutes long, and it hardly merits the price. The content of the DVD was interesting, and I would have liked to see more of it, but I was extremely disappointed when it suddenly ended after only 30 minutes. I expected it would be at least an hour. I also thought the DVD would show the paper mache pumpkins on the cover, which is the reason I bought it, but there was nothing about the paper mache pumpkins.The quality of the video is not particularly impressive, but the host was good and the projects were interesting. If this was a pilot, it would have made an interesting show. But this small pilot does not merit the price of a full-length DVD."
1,THIS IRON IS AWFUL BAD BUY,"NEVER GETS HOT ENOUGH TO IRON COTTON, I HAD TO GO GET MY OLD IRON OUT, GLAD I DID NOT THROW IT AWAY, I DID THROW THE BOX AWAY THIS IRON CAME IN OR I WOULD SEND IT BACK, I WAISTED MY MONEY."
5,The definitive reference work of Sherlock Holmes,"This is one of the few books that I consistently reread every so often. It is heavily annotated, with forays into all conceivable areas of interest, even those as seemingly obscure as the train-schedules of Victorian London. This book is indispensable for anyone inetersted in Holmes."
5,the definitive holmes,"though there are shortcomings in the annotations, this is the best sherlockian resource in existence! if you're an aspiring baker street irregular, this is the collection for you."
5,The right battery!,"I've got a B&D portable 12V drill kit with changeable heads for finishing and sawing. The old battery and charger died, and I could not find batteries to fit my charger at the local stores. Found this battery at Amazon, and also read reviews about a charger that is sold at Target that can be left plugged in and won't overcharge, which is why the old batteries were dying. Got this battery and the Target charger (by B&D, multi-battery charger) and everything is working again!"
4,one of the most romantic and lusciously filmed movies ever!,"I first saw this movie on late night t.v. in the 70's, when I was a pre-teen. This movie made me fall in love with dancing, singing, and Gene Kelly. The lush colors, beautiful locations and elegance of the time make this movie a treat for the eyes. The love story is sweet, but sexy; and you should definitely bring tissue! A great movie to relive the old fashioned days of romance and desire."
4,Good tool for reinforcing French,My kids really like this cd. It definitely reinforces what they are learning in beginner french class. I would recommend.
5,Excellent Read,H.A. Baker does a great job describing the events that occurred in the lives of these Chinese orphans. Their experiences agree with the Holy Bible and are genuine. Definitely worth the buy!
3,"Vivid? Yes!.... but still, not great.","Gira has a talent that might almost be called a gift for coming up with fascinating, vivid, and almost inevitably macabre scenarios for his short stories. Unfortunately, he seems to have trouble figuring out just exactly where to go with them sometimes. He also can't seem to get through a sentence without tossing in at least one gratuitous metaphor - a problem common among musicians who have honed their writing skill on lyrics, since lyrics are much closer to poetry than to prose in most cases. With practice and a firm-handed editor I predict better things, short story wise, from Mr. Gira."
5,Amazing little device!,"I can't rave enough about this player. It's amazingly small and light, with the best screen picture quality I have seen. Sure, you can get one of the cheap no-name brands for a little bit less, but do you really want to strain your eyes on a washed out picture? This is one you'll actually scoop up and carry with you when you travel. The quality also can't be beat. It's well worth the $399 retail price!"
2,"Disappointing if you're looking for ""real deal"" Reiki","Waites started out well, describing how he was drawn to what he was told was ""Reiki."" However, after that point, the book goes downhill. I am a Reiki teacher in several branches of Reiki, but I've never seen some of the practices the author describes as ""Reiki"" in this book. Since he and his teacher also studied in India, perhaps it's a hybrid of Reiki and something else.Originally I bought the book to study the marma points, but upon further study, I see the ones illustrated in the book are not accurate, either.So, for me, the book was a dud. Look to other authors for more realistic Reiki information."
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!,"I can't even begin to tell you how cool this DVD is to a Roger Waters fan. The sound is phenomenal!And how cool it is to see this musical genius interacting with people laughing and joking andBS'ing on the ""Gearing Up"" section of the CD.He seems truly happy and there is even a quick shot of his wife and new child.A definate must have for any Floyd fan and eternal thanks go out to Roger for putting this togetherfor his massive fan base! THANK YOU!!!!"
1,"Great memories, disappointing DVD","I saw Waters on both the 1999 and 2000 leg of his U.S. tour. Somehow, on this DVD, he has managed to drain all the joy, excitement, and exhiliaration from his live performances. What remains is a strangely sterile parody of what I saw. Even the camera shots are badly chosen.There is also a choppy, boring documentary on this DVD, which gave me no new insight into Waters or his band."
2,I was AT the concert and regretted it.,"A floyd fan since the 80s and a follower of the solo carreers to a lesser extent since about the mid 90s, when the opportunity came up to see Roger Waters in concert, I jumped at the opportunity.It had its moments, but as a show, it left much to be desired. After doing a couple old Wall tunes, he closed with his Amnesty International dedication. Fans were incredibly disappointed that the progression of tunes they were used to from Floyd albumms and shows was not followed. It was a TERRIBLE closing tune and everyone knew it. Before it was even over, roughly half the seats in the MGM Grand stadium were emptied. It was SAD. The fact that no encore followed only drove home what I'd heard all along (from fans as well as from Roger's interviews) that he didn't really have much respect for fans.Hold your money. With a little luck, they'll all get over this childish garbage and do a Wall reunion. Until then, I'm not supporting this garbage any further."
2,don't believe the hype,"I really can't believe people think this is better than Pulse! The sound quality is good, but the back up singers are too high in the mix (very distracting, and the camera man seems to be infatuated with them). An electric guitar starting Wish You Were Here?!? David Gilmour, where are you when we need you? Given the fact that these are some of my favorite songs....this DVD was uninspiring. The only good thing about this DVD is getting to hear Roger Water's voice again. Hate to say it but Guy Pratt's (on Pulse) bass playing is far superior to Roger's in every aspect. Same goes for all of the other musicians. Release Pulse on DVD and we won't have to settle for .... imitations anymore!"
5,if you only own 1,I SAW THIS CONCERT 3 TIMES IN HIS TOUR. THIS CAPTURES THE TRUE ESSENCE OF ANY CONCERT I HAVE EVER SEEN! THE SOUND AND ENERGY OF THIS CONCERT WAS AWESOME--I COULD GO EVERY NIGHT AND BE SATISFIED WITH EACH PERFORMANCE! IF YOU ONLY BUY 1 DVD THIS YEAR MAKE IT THIS ONE--YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. THE SOUND IS THE BEST I EVER HEARD AND IT CAPTURES THE REAL CONCERT PERFORMANCE. ROGER IS A TRUE PERFORMER AND POURS HIS HEART OUT TO MAKE THIS A TRULY REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE!
1,Received two broken dishes :(,"Upset, I received it and had a broken salad plate and bowl...it should be shipped more carefully, It's a lot of money to spend to receive broken dishes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Harvesters,"I rented this DVD...Kicked back with my lady friend...You Know...All of the sudden, I was like ...where did those sinister ""Jive Turkeys"" get this trippin idea...All I can say is go dog...Get it before you can't or...You Know....Right"
2,Discover NO-Sounds Workshop,"This was my 1st Little Tikes purchase for my 9 month old son. He loves spinning the wheels. However, the music does not come on after dropping the balls after 2 weeks of purchase. Also now after 4 months, the crank stops making sound too. Although a fun toy, we were unlucky with the quality / durability."
4,Durable toy and fun,"Bought this for my daughter when she was 6 months, she just stop playing with it at 2.5 years of age. Perfect toy, robust and easy to clean. Recommend this one and the other version I purchased."
2,Very dissapointed,We were very dissapointed with this toy. Our son seemed interested at first but very rarely plays with it anymore. He is 11 months old now and it just doesn't hold his interest. He may walk over and hit the nails a few times or drop the balls through once or twice but definately doesn't stay with it. I have talked to other parents whose kids love it though. They are all different and like different toys.update : our son is now 21 months old and has still never played with this toy. he is very active and likes toys that make noise but just has no interest in this.
3,Not perfectly safe,"My one year olds twins received this for Christmas along with the Discover Sounds Kitchen. My daughter sticks her hand down the ball drop hole to pick up a ball instead of getting a ball from the side pocket. Once she has the ball in her hand, she cannot get her hand back out and hasn't figured out to drop the ball. This has happened three different times. Once, she walked off dragging the workshop behind her until I caught up with her. She was not injured, but was very upset. I sit right next to her when she is playing with the workshop, or put it up. My twins use the Discover Sounds Kitchen more often and we have not had any problems with it."
5,Best delirious? album yet!,"Been a huge fan since the late 90's. This is their best work yet. Full of honest worship, beautiful lyrics, masterfully layered music. Yeah God!"
4,The Mission Bell is on a mission to change music,"Wow. I was surprised at how good this CD actually is. Prior to the release of this CD, I wasn't the biggest fan of Delirious?, but I thought they were worth paying attention to. Well, as it turns out, at the release of this album, they wowed me. The CD was so good that I had to take a step back and rethink my list of favorite artists.. Needless to say, they are now amongst my favorites."
5,The end is near,"Syn Shinron has eaten all 7 Dragonballs, and now has the power of all the Dragons. Goku is no match for the evil force of destruction. Luckily, Vegeta has a plan. He shows up and suggests that they use fusion to defeat the evil Syn."
3,AF does not work with Nikon D40/D40X cameras,I haven't used long range lenses before and did not realize how challenging the job is. However the lens is very sharp. It has quite noticable chromatic abberation issue. The main part is that it's not designed to work with Nikon D40/D40X cameras (that's what I have) as their autofocusing mechanism is different and requires special kind of lenses. I did not know about it before I purchased the lens. Amazing thing is - no ad mentions it. So I focus it manualy. It's an extra challenge as under most conditions depth of field is very shallow and using the viewfinder you cannot tell for sure when your subject is really in focus. It only shows later when you review your shot in details. Long range shots must be taken from a tripod - no VR. You get what you pay for. I think it's OK if you are planning to use it in a bright day light for remote static scenes.
3,"Not a pro Edward book, get it for biographical information","Worth more for the biographical information it contains than for entertainment. This is not an Edward and Sophie fan book, there are several instances where the author could even be considered mean. It's a couple of years old now but is still one of the few books written about the Prince and his wife."
5,Cary Grant Classics,"Outstandingly supurb. I am a long time fan of any of Cary Grant movies, and you will never find any to compare. Recomend very highly"
2,Decent product but did not come with all parts,"I was very excited to receive this CD/DVD holder, as we have just moved and it was going to solve a clutter problem. However, upon opening, the hardware parts package had been previously opened and was taped back together. Some parts were missing from this package. It is very frustrating to have to go purchase parts to put something together when you have paid for a fully functional item. This seller needs to do better quality assurance before shipping things."
3,nice but difficult to assemble,The item is very nice once put together. That was difficult and not made well as far as assembly. It is a nice product and is sturdy now that it is assembled.
5,DVD STORAGE,"Unit was great, looks great and functions as advertised, the assembly was somewhat time consuming although i fix things for a living so it presented no problems"
2,does not last,The carpet was a great size and fit my tank well. However after a week it needed to be washed. I sprayed it off then hung it to dry. Once dry it was warped and misshapen. When I put it back in the tank it seems to have shrunk too! I have used the eco carpet in the past which held up much better to a washing.
2,Well... It was his first book.,"I've given it two stars purely because it's nice to see the evolution of his writing. This is not a good book. But, I sure as hell can't write. Harlan Coben can write great fiction. This shows how far he's progressed in his writing. He's now a, (seemingly), effortless writer. I'm glad I read it. He wrote this in his early 20's. In my early 20's, I was a waste of space so, even in its bad form, he's still made out a far site better than I."
1,reviewer sjc muscatine ia should stay dead,very disappointd with mr coben poor writing and no suspense had it all solved in first 100 pages and did not hold an ounce of interest thro those long dull chapters
1,Yikes!,"Kudos for Harlan to keep writing. His debut was a mess. How many times can you extol a person's beauty over and over again? Gag me already! There are passages that you just cannot bear. May be reading the book is easier than listening to the book on tape. Luckily there was a forwarding button, taking small jumps forward. But still there are better things to do with your time even if you are stuck in a car for a 13 hour drive. Why would anyone make a decision like the main character did? It is very unlikely unless you're psychotic. The main man was not portrayed as such.I'd pass on this one. If you are going on a long drive always bring a few backup books on tape, you never know when you hit a poor one."
3,Don't always believe what you read,"Someone had suggested I read Harlan Coben's books. When I find an author I have not read I start with their first book and work forward. The reviews were mixed on Play Dead and my expectation was not high knowing this was the authors first book. It was surprising to find a disclaimer by the author telling me not to read it. My personality is such that had I had no other reason, that gave me the impetus to read this.This is not the best book I have read nor the worst. It is a good read, held my interest, a bit predictable, and I would recommend it to anyone. I look forward to reading the rest of Coban's books and if he truly writes better, then I am in for some good reading."
1,Abysmal,I usually quite enjoy Coben as a holiday read- but this is absolute drivel. Kind of Harlequin Romance meets teenage creative writing assignment. I couldn't even bear to finish it. Don't waste your money.
2,boring,"He does warn you it's his first story, fair enough (and kudos to him, other authors don't do this.) But couldn't he have edited it a little?It's all back story, description, telling (and telling and telling and telling.) We get it after the 1st repetition that his wife is drop dead beautiful. That they're both wonderful and perfect people w/o a flaw.Really, after the 1st hundred pages all we have is a man is missing under mysterious conditions. No action, no real plot, just lots of intrigue, more like a soap opera than thriller. Where's the mystery, the suspense, the thrill.Not sure if I'm going to finish. Already guessed the plot, and it's not pretty. Struggled with another 10 pages this morning . . ."
1,Like the Author - Poorly Written,"I am a fan of Harlan Coben and was excited the other day when I saw Play Dead for sale. I assumed that it was one of his newer novels that I had somehow missed. I excitedly purchased the book and could not wait to dive in.I knew something was amiss when there was a note by the author on the first page saying: ""Okay, if this is the first book of mine you're going to try, stop now. Return it.""I wish I had taken the advice and simply never have purchased it. I read the first 140 pages and stopped. Terrible writing, shallow characters and everyone has a (not too interesting) secret. The most beautiful super model in the world marries the NBA all-star who always wins every game on a last second shot. Really?I felt like I was reading a book by a 16-year old version of the Harlan Coben. Not fit to print or read. Do not waste your time on this one."
2,Coben's Correct,"It's just as he ways in his disclaimer; the book is not worth the effort. His others are terrific! Read this only if it's the last one for you to read--which for me, it was. Can't wait for his next one; this one will make whatever he does worthwhile!"
2,"Not new, a re-issue that should not have been","My mistake for looking only at the recent copyright - I thought it was a new book. This, his first novel, was a poor effort. No excitement, no character development, boring plot with the ""twists"" telegraphed far in advance. It reads like one of those romance books masquerading as ""suspense"". Uggh."
4,Strictly for Mathis fans,"If you're a Johnny Mathis fan,you'll like it. He can still sing a good melody. At the age of 60 his pipes are not as smooth as they were in 1958. He doesn't glide up to those high notes as good as he used to, but Johnny will still bring you memories of that back seat in the old Chevy. I just hope that they put his Christmas video on DVD."
5,Wonderful on every level,"As a musician, I never grow tired of Bach's music. It's also obvious to me that John Eliot is meticulous in how he prepared for this pilgrimage, and what he expected out of each performance. I'm writing this to inform anyone who is interested that the complete year long cycle of performances were recorded, and are being released individually on John Eliot Gardiners own label, SDG. (Many of you will know the acronym) They are being released about 4 per year. Each CD is incomparable. Google Monteverdi choir for more info"
1,Absolute crap,"I bought this player at Best Buy a couple months ago. The player skips on DVDs that have no visible scratches. Half of the time you stick a DVD in the player, it gets stuck trying to load it, and you have to eject the DVD and put it back in for the player to actually read it. Some DVDs it simply won't read at all, and I have to play them in my computer. It is the worst DVD player I have ever used."
5,Different Kind Of Western,"Terence Hill always made me laugh with his Trinity movie series with Bud Spenser, and this one is no exception. As in fast gun with strange ""child-like"" quality, he wonders in and out of trouble with ease and humor. He has to help his favorite western legend ""go out"" in style. Why he would want the job of replacing him is beyond me, but the humor is pure Trinity. Sergio Leone write this, so you know it done in a grand scale. I added this to my western DVD collection because of the humor, Henry Fonda, and interesting climax."
2,a pity,"After viewing, this DVD has been made out an NTSC encoded video tape: color, resolution and sound are those of a rental NTSC video.If your TV is an old analog set, no difference.If you have a beamer and/or a hi-fi system and expect good quality, you will be disapointed.Wham unlike the MGM has obviously chosen the low cost way whenporting oldies westerns to DVD."
3,a solid chianti and bowtie pasta movie,"Henry Fonda gives a stoic performance of a well educated gunslinger. Terence Hill gives a solid performance as a not yet educated gunslinger. The movie is an education process. If you'd like to learn some good life lessons, pay attention to Henry Fonda's last lines."
4,A must-see third in the Trinity series.,"The fastest gun in the west (Henry Fonda) meets a faster gun (Terrence Hill), but they do everything but square off right away. Hill, who stars in ""My Name is Trinity"" and ""My Name is Still Trinity,"" caps the trilogy with this movie, released as ""Il Mio Nome E' Nessumo."" Wit and physical humor spice up action that includes the Wild Bunch. Deserves to be in any western film collection!"
4,Good Cowboy Comedy,"This is one of Terrence Hill's Best Movies,Good comedy.Henry Fonda did pretty good too."
4,GOOD MOVIE,I HAD BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY HUSBAND WHO ABSOLUTELY LOVES THE FIRST MOVIE IN THIS SERIES. EVERY TIME I AM MADE TO WATCH THIS I FIND SOMETHING NEW I HAD MISSED BEFORE.
2,Mattress is too thin,"Very disappointed in this. The futon is too thin, and you can feel the slats right through it.."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS,"the product looks nice in the picture & decorative. Like many buyers, I stood on the futon & it broke. The bottom of the futon was not supported by the metal but wood. I wasted my $."
2,Metal futon frame with wooden flex slats,"I bought a ""Milan"" frame several years ago locally and it's held up quite well. It's not as easy to open and close as I would like but it mostly stays in one position so it's not a huge inconvenience.About a year ago I bought another ""Milan"" frame on-line but it doesn't seem to be the same. I experienced a similar problem being described by other reviewers. After putting my knee on the bed, one of the wooden ""flex"" slats snapped.My futon mattress (also a year old) has inner coils and it's quite comfortable but it's outer edges don't seem to be holding their shape as well as I would like. If you're looking for comfort, I would buy the futon mattress separately. One of my previous futon mattresses had a 3 yr expected life span and after 3 years it had a huge hole in the middle (I may not have turned it as much a I should have). That's why I chose the inner coils this time which should last approx. 10 yrs."
3,still a good story,This is a much more introspective story than I remember from having read it as a teenager. It is also a story more likely to appeal to teenage girls rather than boys. There is less action and suspense in it than I remember.
2,A hard required read for high school,This book was on my summer reading list and I did'nt know what to think of it at first. The first chapter is set around completely different characters than the rest of the book and doesnt seem to fit until the end of the book. Along with a very confusing second chapter where way to many different characters were introduced making it hard to follow their conversation. The mystery was easy to figure out and it was very easy to get frustrated with the main characters because of their lack of communication. All in all i was more happy to be done with the book and only slightly satisfied about learning how everyone ended up.
3,Not for non-German readers,"This is perhaps a book for people who can read German or can follow the English translation, since it is a dual language edition. Otherwise, one should rather get another edition. At least the edition that I have is of rather cheap quality. I'm more happy with the Norton Critical Edition since it contains both parts I and II plus."
5,Book that shows you about peoples life,This book is what Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe wroteThis book shows you temptation and other things that makes your life miserable.
2,A passable attempt,"While the translator deserves praise in his efforts of tackling a difficult work, the result is average at best. The excision of text, as has already been noted by other reviewers, is the biggest reason to avoid this translation, but I will admit that it is perhaps the most accessible and easily read translation available. For those with a serious interest in Goethe and Faust, I would recommend the Walter Arndt/Cyrus Hamlin critical edition from Norton. I believe that to be a much more accurate rendering of Goethe's exemplary work."
2,Long Long Long,WHAT is with this author and her long drawn out stories! She is way too descriptive and this book went on FOREVER! I do not foresee purchasing anymore books from her.
1,not a very good product.,"this was purchased it got here on time but after only about a mile of being inflated (below the 30 psi max) it just deflated, not it has a very large hole in it and I never ran over any sharp objects, this is a poor product."
3,"Good movie, kinda lame extras ...","THE MOVIE:A well produced movie, based on the best-seller. I hold a little issue with Tom Hanks in the lead role. His performance was acceptible, but forgettable. Audrey Tatou was excellent. The movie dragged from time to time, but the need to tell the story demanded this. Ian McKellen as the reclusive grail scholar was a very astute choice, and the brightest moment of the movie for me was the interplay between mcKellen and Hanks.THE EXTRAS:The replica of the cryptex is poorly constructed. The replica of Langdon's notebook is even more so. The poor quality of these items does not justify the additional price paid for them."
2,This one strayed too far from the book,"Having read this book more than once, I wanted to see the movie. Full of action and intrigue, it moves rapidly and most everyone probably enjoys it. But I was disappointed! It strayed so far from the book that I was let down. I am aware that movies adapted from books are often changed for length purposes. Guess I am more of a reader/listener and not a movie fan."
3,Eh,"Wait for it on video. Not worth going to see on the big screen and spending the cash. We checked our watches several times. It was like eating a bland meal - we kept waiting for the flavor and seasoning, but never got it."
2,It's a joke...,"Someone wanted to make Indiana Jones part 4, starring Tom Hanks and created a such puzzled labyrinth that I think the book author wouldn't be able to tell the whole story without looking into his notes. After watching this movie it leaves a bad taste in the mouth that you have vaisted 2 hours on nonsense. 5 Stars for special effects."
2,Misleading description of DVD,"Seller listed Full Screen DVD, but mailed wide screen dvd, as she states it is ""more desireable."" Then change the description of the dvd."
3,"certainly controversial, certainly a bit slow","I read the book and enjoyed it although I'd never call it a masterpiece. Some of Dan Browns other work is better but this one has an epic scale that should translate well to film.They got a lot of the suspense and drama right, but the movie never has the pace of the book. You know less about the characters and there's no connection between them like you feel in the book. I found myself glancing at the clock during the movie a few times as it really begins to drag on too long and spend a fair bit of time going nowhere. Fun enough for a watch but this has no real replay value and I wouldn't enthusiastically recommend it to anyone."
2,So disappointed,I loved the book. And a book obviously is allowed to be wordy. But not a film. The film was literally like the actors sitting with a copy of the book saying lines. It was all words with bits of good scenery. Ian Mckellen once again saved the film and Audrey Tatou wasn't too bad. Left out some parts and I was not happy with the outcome
3,"Solid, entertaining, unmemorable","The Da Vinci Code is based on an insanely popular book, so it would've been a mega hit no matter what. The film, while having moments of suspense and well-photographed settings, is a fun little piece of escapism and not much more. Tom Hanks is miscast and incredibly bland, Audrey Tatou is gorgeous but struggles with every line of English, and Ian Mackellan delivers a complex, smarmy performance. The screenplay is capable but not particularly smart, and the direction is matter-of-fact and without any particular sense of style. All in all it's good for a one-time viewing but not something you could particularly care much more about."
3,"good movie, no need to the second disk.","you'd find better value by buying the single disk version, i found very little extra value in the second disk."
1,"In a word, BORING!","Do most people realize this is a fiction novel made into a movie? I would hope so because the basis for this nonsense comes from Lincoln and Baigent's book, HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL, which is another pile of nonsense. I read the book and didn't find it particularly enthralling (give me a good James Patterson novel anytime), so I've never understood the hype. The movie however, is slow and a lot of folks got up and walked out or fell asleep. Why Ron Howard and Tom Hanks would tackle something like this is beyond me...oh, no I guess it's not...MONEY was the obvious reason after the book was such a huge seller. Don't waste your time on the movie..."
2,Dissapointing movie from a great book,"I thought the book was excellent but this movie was probably the worst I saw in 2006. The casting is completely wrong (did the casting director actually read the book ?) and most of the film is set in darkness with low level illumination of the activity being filmed, a guaranteed eye strain"
2,read the book,"This really isnt a bad movie if you havent read the book, if you have read the book then think of this as another story based on the same subject. i understand that a book to movie will leave certain things out, and i accept that, but to completely change the ending is not excusable. What was wrong with the way the book ended? Like i said if you havent read the book you will like this movie although they do solve these very complex puzzles after a glance at them(even though they hide a very very valuable secret that will change the world). If you havent read the book or seen the movie do yourself a favor and pick up a copy, its a better story and its cheaper if bought in the paperback, if you dont have time to read it then get it on audio disk or tape."
2,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with ""The Da Vinci Code."" It was drawn out, boring, and predictable. I can only opine on approximately the first half of the movie because I fell asleep and missed the rest."
1,The silliest story ever told,"This film has to be one of the most ridiculous ever made. It is an incoherent, baffling and tedious tale about some vast conspiracy by the Catholic Church to cover up the truth about Jesus (that he was married to Mary Magdalene and had offspring), and apparently just about everything that has ever happened in world history since has been caused by this continuing cover-up. I have seldom seen a film both so ridiculous and so boring. It is slow, dull, pretentious and almost entirely incomprehensible. It is depressing to think that the novel on which this film is based has been a massive best-seller. Absolute drivel from beginning to end."
1,Poor Quality in a NEW DVD,"I paid for a NEW copy of the Da Vinci Code and it has worked horrible. The frames keep freezing, but, the sound keep going. Amazon is probably making their own copies to sell. I will never make another purchase from you."
2,The Da Vinci Code,"The Da Vinci Code has a really good storyline to it with alot of great characters. The problem with it, for me, was that it was a little to confusing. I guess if you've read the book then you will have a better understanding of what goes on in the film. It sure didn't have alot of action that's for sure. Tom Hanks, Paul Bettany, and Ian McKellen were great in the movie. All three of them were a great pick for this film. I'd recommend reading the book before seeing the movie."
1,Why bother,"There is no real acting for this story. Everyone can just be themselves, and I guess I was hoping for a little oomph injected into this long and winding movie."
2,Enjoy the Book . . . Skip the Movie,"For a book that moved with such breakneck excitement that you couldn't put it down, the movie plods awkwardly along and bores the viewer quickly because the screenplay fails to provide a lot of essential background information that makes the characters and the plot understandable. I also hate movies where much of the dialog is spoken in a foreign language with subtitles. It is especially awkward when playing the widescreen version on a 16X9 flat panel, and you zoom the picture to fill the screen to avoid plasma burn-in. Only one line of the subtitle can be seen, and that's a headache. However, this is a personal problem and has nothing to do with the movie itself. All in all, it didn't compare with the book, and it failed to have that Ron Howard magic. My advice is to skip the movie. However, if you must give it a try, be sure to read the book first, or you'll get lost during the first 45 minutes or so and snooze through the rest of it."
5,Really Good Movie,"I really enjoy Ron Howard's ""The Da Vinci Code"". Its intresting, thought provoking, and thrilling. Decent performences, great direction and a well thoughtout story make this a good film in my opinion. I am glad to own the DVD and the Special Edition does the film justice. If you are intrested in religious themed films (though the events and history in the film are fake) or into conspiracy films, you will enjoy this."
4,The Da Vinci Code,Not as good as the book which was great. But watchable if you have read the book and can fill in the spaces the movie leaves out.
3,Just read the darn book already!,"The movie couldnt have been done much better, but having said that its dull in comparison to the book. The pace of the movie is too fast, and it ruins the suspense. The movie fails to bring facts to life and people who havent read it are left confused and suspicious. It works very well in the book, but this adaptation just makes the whole concept seem more fictious than before.For Christ sake, just read the book. Its more interesting than the bible!"
1,First-class Stinker,What a let down this film was! The American main actor was very unconvincing and not in character. The French actress produced lines mixed with a very strong accent and a speach impediment - a rather offensive portrait of French people speaking English. The British actor seemed to forget - once again - the repeated advise to limit his over-acting. What a mess!
1,would give it zero stars if I could,"Truly a stinkbomb. One of the worst, most boring and incomprehensible films I've ever seen, and I like Howards films. Tom Hanks' hairdo is one for the books - right up there with Colin Farrel's pompadou in Alexander. Rent this from your library if you must, but don't waste your money. Disaster. Only the albino monk made it watchable."
1,"save thyself, do not even rent this joke of a history retelling","I can make fun of this without mercy because everyone involved with the project made a billion dollars. OK, The person who you thought was your grandfater, is not your grandfather, the holy grail, was not a grail, ?!?, The real Grail was in janitor's closet in England. I'm not making this up. Actually no, the real, real Grail, is underneath a tourist attraction in Paris, throw in an albino, and some Catholic priests who attack people other then young boys and presto changeo whammo bammo, you have the Davinci CodeORRR just call it ""Dogma meets JFK"" only with more conspiracies."
3,A pleasant suprise,I am not a fan of Tom Hanks and I didn't find the book all that interesting so I wasn't expecting much out of this movie. I saw it earlier this afternoon and it was a pleasant surprise. Tom Hanks did a good job portraying a professor of linguistics caught up in high drama. The movie had a good pace to it so unlike the book it didn't get boring. I have told everyone I have run across today that it was worth seeing and would present it that way to anyone interested in it. As far as the religious controversy--my spiritual beliefs aren't harmed for one minute if Jesus was or was not married with or without children or even if he had been human. His teachings are still worth listening to. This movie didn't seem antagonistic to me at all. The people hunting down the grail guardians were presented as a small group of fanatics who would be excommunicated if caught doing what they were doing.As I stated I feel it was well worth watching.
4,A good short summary of the book,"a good summary of the book, wish it had been longer, key aspects were left out."
3,"Good price, marginal quality","The first stand shipped to me arrived broken in two separate sections due to the lower end quality of the rivets. The seller sent me a replacement stand, but the manner in which the ratcheting top is affixed to the body of the boom leaves something to be desired. It is a little on the ""loose"" side. I would recommend spending a few more dollars for a name brand stand."
5,GREAT BOOK!,"This is another great book by Dr Larimore! A bang up job as always and as always great, funny, clean stories!"
1,....,If you like h2o's previous cd's stay as far away from this release as you can...toby seems to half sing half whine the lyrics (which aren't very good) and the music is repetitive and boring...nothing like the h2o of old.
1,What happened?,"I remember in 1997 or so when these guys were hardcore. What happened?I picked this cd up in a used cd bin, and no wonder someone sold this cd - its awful!There is nothing hardcore about these guys anymore, its pop punk and well ... not even very good pop punk. Bummer because these guys used to be really good."
3,Socks fit very well,"These socks fit very well, even over muscular calves. the quality is good but are very static-ey when they come out of the dryer. The navy blue socks are very dark, you can't tell them from black ones."
3,Your average thriller...,"This thriller was average in every way. If you are interested in biological warfare, definitely get this book. Otherwise, whatever. Gorgon is too much of the average, run-of-the-mill evil terrorist villian. This book has plenty of pointless sex in it, but not much in the way of characters. It's a good read, but not great. If you are incredibly bored and need reading material, go ahead and get the book. Otherwise, why bother?"
5,Estimate versus Esteem the Self,"Foster's How to Deal with Depression is a popularly written and an immensely practical self-help book. Although Foster opens with a distinctly Freudian view of depression, naming it and expressing it dissipates it, he broadens his description of etiology to common conflicts that sometimes cause depression: conflicts with parents, between the ideal and real self, and between friends and lovers.Foster's analysis of role conflict depression adds new dimensions to the causes and treatments of the disorder. He also examines irrational and immature beliefs underlying depression and guilt, as well as deals with anger against God in a healthy manner.Rather than showing ways to build self-esteem, Foster centers his discussion around ""self-estimation"" like William James. You will find this book a great introduction of the topic.-- Journal of Psychology and Christianity, 1989, 8 (3), 89-91"
2,OMFG....WHY OH WHY DO THEY KEEP RUINING THIS!?????,"I am mad at the EXTENSIVE cutting of scenes all of the episodes. The cheesy music instead of the music from the series I can tolerate but the eliminating of scenes I cannot. They completely took out the storyline of Andrea going to the sorority with her star of David and only show the aftermath, cut out the girls showing up at Alpha house and cut out the end where the girls pledge to the Peach Pit sorority. The RUINED Cindy and Jim's Anniversary by not playing ""What the World needs now"" and cutting scenes. They COMPLETELY MURDERED the episode where Brenda finds the diary from a 60's teen. I'm sorry but the music in that episode was PIVOTAL!!!!!!!!!! PLUS, they cut out all the historical footage...this is complete BULLS**T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!There HAS to be a place to write to to complain!!????They better pony up to the music rights because this is getting ridiculous. I won't pay money for DVDs with chopped up shows!"
1,stop buying the dvds,"maybe if everyone stops buying the dvds they'll stop putting them out with cut scenes and no music. the show is boring to watch without the music. also most episodes are just odd with all the cut scenes. half the time I wonder if I missed something. why are they cutting the scenes? are they just bored? or to lazy to take the music out so they just hit delete? either way I am not buying anymore. I'll rent them. they aren't worth it to own. or better yet watch it on tv for free, not cut, with the music!"
5,THE ETERNAL RETURN,"Study Max Ernst & you'll see the process behind the product. You'll see the alchemy behind the artistry. Max was a master, & has much to show us, particularly in this period. Wonder at the eididic patterns & at all that is eluded to, yet never expressed. Observe the black sun in ""The Union of the Heavens & the Earth""--- here was a guy who knew a thing or two about a thing or two! This is not just an art book, it's a manual, pure & simple."
5,Great piggy bank.,"I bought this piggy bank for a grandson to help him learn to save money. It is very durable and made a great gift, especially since it was given with some money already in it."
2,Died after two months,"I bought the DeWalt D55146 from big orange 2 months ago. It died today after only two months of daily use. The last two or three days it sounded like it was laboring and it was taking a lot longer to bring the tank up to pressure. Now it doesn't make a peep. No idea what's wrong, and don't intend to mess with it. I'm taking it back for a refund, or possible replacement, under big orange's 90 day return policy.The other poster's comment about the drain position is right on. It's a pain in the rear to bleed it down and get the moisture out. I added an 8"" drain line extending to the side with the valve at the end. Makes it much easier to reach. But having to prop it up at 45 degree angle to get the water out is a significant design deficiency."
2,Nice 'til it dies,"I really liked this compressor for the first year and a half. It was easy to move around or load into the truck and worked well enough for my needs. Then the regulator started leaking... The nearest authorized service center was 75 miles away so DeWalt sent me an O-ring kit. Two weeks later, when the kit finally arrived, and after 10 minutes to install it I was back in business.It's been less than a year since replacing the o-rings and I think the motor has burned up :( I AM REALLY DISSAPOINTED IN THIS COMPRESSOR! For the price I could have bought 2 of another brand.If you buy this to air up the kids bicycle tires, you will love it! If you have work to do, this would be a poor choice."
1,Don't waste the Money,"I bought this product a year ago and within a few uses, the air leak around the regulator started and has rendered this product useless. This flaw in design should have been corrected by now. I'm frustrated to see people with the same complaint from 4 years ago.What a waste of $300."
1,Defective and poor support,"I am very disappointed with this compressor. After using it a couple of times it stopped working. When I've bought Dewalt in the past their products have always been high quality and have lasted a long time. This however is a piece of junk.To make matters worse support was unhelpful and the only solution they offered would be for one of my employees to take it to a service center (20 miles away), wait a week or so, and then go pick it up. They wouldn't mail a replacement part or let us mail the entire thing in for service.The one good thing is that it stopped working so quickly that it was still covered by Amazon's 30 day return policy so we were able to return it to Amazon for a full refund.I advise everyone to stay far away from this compressor and purchase something else."
5,Nice.,"If you deffiantly want to hear Dir en Grey try a crack at something different, it's a great album. It fits well into the metal genre."
3,May Make you Angry,"Warning this book may make you angry. As other reveiwers have noted, this book is old. It was written and researched in 1996. I purchased this book used. After reading about some of the great riding opportunities at Chino Hills State Park, I used the internet to see if anything had changed. To my dismay, the two best trails in the park, Gilman Singletrack and Water Canyon, have been closed to bikers. Also several other singletrack trails in the park have been closed completely. I probably won't even ride Chino Hills now. It is unfortunate that the state treats mountainbikers so poorly, but it is not the writers fault. They actually wrote a very good book and I'm sure tht there is much good information in there. The problem is that some of the information is outdated. However, if you use the book in conjunction with information that can be found on the internet then it is a good buy. Especially if you can find it used as I did."
5,Classic R&B at it's best!,"I've been a Blue Magic fan for well over twenty-years. During the early 70's my girlfriends and I travelled the entire east coast to see ""The Magic of the Blue."" During rain, shine or winter blizzards, goupies in a positive sense, we were there. We knew when they were on and nights when there was obviosuly something missing. Their harmony combined with smooth dance steps defined one of the best R&B groups of the 70's. Listening to 'The Best of Blue Magic' brings a broad smile to my face. Great listening music on a rainy Friday night with candles & incence buring and your favorite cocktail. (And of course your significant other)."
4,Great Product Poor Customer Service,"I bought this bike for my 12 year old son on Xmas of 2005. Seems to work awesome. Almost nothing to put together, my kind of present!!! HOWEVER a part broke on the handlebar (his fault) and I am trying like heck to contact the manufacturer to find out where to get this fixed and THERE IS NO KNOWN PHONE # FOR THEM!!!!!!!! Amazon doesn't even have the # , they have an email (and we all know how that goes)...so I emailed and crossed my fingers.....waiting to hear!!!!! JUST FYI"
1,Product does not perform as specified on box,"My 5 year old had a pocket rocket that would reach 12 to 15 mph. We thought the minimoto maxii would be the best step up, since the size is a little larger and on the box it indicated the speed of this product was 18 mph. Now online it's only stating to go 10 mph. I'd be highly surprised if it goes that fast. Also, as soon as it hits grass it seems to virtually go dead. I would not recommend this product unless you're putting a complete beginner on it and you live in a parking lot!"
3,Must be seen to be (un)believed,"This film is unbelievably bad, a product/relic of the French film industry at its low water mark in the early 1980's. Lee Marvin, in his penultimate role, appears to be drunk and nearly dead throughout most of the film. Tina Louise (yes, ""Ginger"" from Gilligan's Island and still sporting the same hair style) is cast at Lee Marvin's ""moll"", presumably because the producer/director found them in the same nursing home. The sound is terrible, the dubbing is unintentionally hilarious and the film is presented in full screen (pan and scan).So why did I give it three stars? This is a ""party"" film, to be enjoyed while inebriated with your friends. That and the fact that Lee Marvin was a better ""action hero"" with one foot in the grave than most of today's crop of wannabes."
1,DVD,i HAD TO SEND THE DVD BACK BECAUSE IT WAS FAULTY AND COULD NOT PLAY THE DVD. THE PROVIDER NEEDS TO CHECK THE QUALITY OF HIS DVDS BEFORE SENDING. NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER
1,"Stay Clear of ""Beverly Wilshire Filmworks""....Poor Quality","This review is not so much about the film, but the poor quality of the DVD.The picture quality is horrific! Fortunately, I only lost $2.00 on it not including S&H; and sales tax.This should serve as a warning! If the item is too low-priced, it's more than likely of poor quality (as opposed to high inventory). I will never buy DVD's from 'Beverly Wilshire Filmworks'. I'll have to seek out the French only version of ""Canicule"" found on Amazon.fr, which was released by 'Studio Canal'. I hope I have better luck.Love and Peace,Carlos Romero"
2,Theory OK But,"This movie spent a lot of time on sexual implications and direct sexual, vulgar language. At one point a woman in the movie kept begging to be f...ked and was murdered for bothering a man who would not. The picture was blurry most of the time but I was able to watch it. The plot was ok, (nothing exciting). For the age and price of this movie it was passable.Watch this if you have nothing else to watch."
5,Juice Extractor,"This was my first experience using a juicer. It works well, just remember to follow the instructions. I did actually make wheat grass juice using this juicer, you have to add a little water along with the wheat grass.It does make a bit of a mess tho, but clean up isn't that hard."
5,Easy to use and clean.,This is my very first juicer. It was very easy to use and clean (if use plastic bag for the trash). Overall I like this product but I only use once since I've this machine.
2,Small basket and cutting plate are the problem,"This is essentially the same design as 67650 with less expensive construction (more plastic than metal). They suffer from the same common design flaws: small cutting plate, small basket, and the honeycomb filter is too fine. The problem with small cutting plate is that there are fewer cutting ""teeth"" and slower rotation velocity toward the edge. Combined with the ""big mouth,"" the motor will slow down significantly when a large amount of food goes down the throat. The problem with small basket is that pulp does not get hydrated enough before flying out of chute. The smaller area also makes cleaning more frequent. The problem with overly find honeycomb mesh filter is that is get clogged easily. Once it is clogged, the juicing efficiency is greatly reduced.[...]."
2,Out-of-Date,"I ordered this edition without checking the publication date and was disappointed with the 1986 edition. Much change has gone on in the National Archives and this older edition does not have up-to-date information. I have the reviewed the more recent Guide to Genealogical Research in the National Archives, published in 2000 and find it a valuable resource."
3,SPACEMAN NEEDS REHAB,BILL LEE BRINGS US HIS 3RD BOOK CONCERNING HIS BASEBALL AND TRAVELS IN LIFE. ONCE AGAIN IT IS HUMOROUS AND INTERESTING BUT I GOT TIRED OF HIS CONSTANT EXAGGEGRATING EVERY STORY AND I QUESTION HOW MANY AND HOW MUCH OF HIS STORIES ARE TRUE. I THINK HE IS QUITE WITTY AND A GOOD STORY TELLER. HOPEFULLY HE WILL GO TO REHAB AND GET HELP. HE IS DEFINATELY AN ALCOHOLIC AND ADDICT.
4,It's ALL been said....,"I don't think I can add anymore accalades about this series. We've been waiting a loooong time for this series on DVD! HOWEVER, I gave it 4 stars because of the packaging. Although the transparent case w/the episode summaries printed on the reverse side of the outside jacket insert probably saved a buck, PLEASE, charge the extra buck for future seasons & give us an insert where we don't have to remove disc #3 to read any of the episode summaries!!!"
4,MSG's Unforgiven straight out kicks a##!,"This is a must buy for every Schenker fan and every one who likes such kicka## bands like Deep Purple,UFO,Led Zeppelin,and early Van Halen.I bought tis album not knowing what to expect after the dissapointments of a few of the MSG previous albums,but was surprised by the great hard rock sons and the deepness of the album.This album is like a breath of fresh air, knowing that there are still bands that can kick a## still in a day full of teen-idol garbage!The best of the all around great songs on this album are Turning Off the Emotion,Hello Angel,The Mess I've Made,and Pilot of Your Soul. It's great to know there still is Rock and Roll and not just The Backsteet pretty boys,Jenifer(I can't sing live because I have no musical talent Lopez) or any of the other stir fried cr#p tats out there. I am still kicking myself because I didn't go see him live here localy a few months ago before I got the album...dam!"
2,Disappointed,"Title says it all. I have four points to make. 1) The whole album sounds sort of 'fuzzy', unclear. 2) Kelly sounds exactly like David Coverdale (Whitesnake, Deep Purple) or the other way around. 3) Schenker's guitar work (tho good) is muted and distorted. His solos are VERY disappointing. I'm used to his crystal clear plucking, but this is bad. 4) All the songs sound the same. That's about it. I still prefer Michael as a member of UFO as opposed to solo."
4,Not New Studio But New LIVE Music,"I've seen these guys about 8 times, and most recently about 3 months ago and let me say this CD captures their sound about as close as possible. The latest tour had a western theme to it and they trick you right from the start thinking that all the music has been re-written to sound western.They have included a great assortment of songs over the years on this CD, so it's like another ""greatest hits"", but the quality and sound is really amazing. The mixing is perfect and you feel like your there at one of their concerts.There is also a DVD soon to be released of the same concert. I highly recommend it if it's any quality like the CD. The show was unbelievable.PS. Fee also added at the end of the concert to keep an eye out for a NEW STUDIO CD. Let's keep our fingers crossed."
5,Life in the balance,"This is a beautifully light, breezy album that will sweep you away to warm summer days. Sara Tavares recalls her native homeland, Cabo Verde, with references to Lisboa and other places, in a wonderful collection of songs. Hers is quite a different voice from that of the great Cesaria Evora. It is young, vibrant and guides the listener in a new direction away from the mornas that Evora was so famous for. Tavares is one of several young Cabo Verdean singers, but to me she is the most promising, as her music has a very international feel to it, a confluence of African and European rhythms that at times seem Caribbean in flavor. She has been traveling all over the place and has a great personal website, so check her out! You will be hearing a lot more from her."
2,not too good,"too soft, does not go in between teeth, brushes also too thin, and i will choose different ways of cleaning my teeth."
5,Nice quality!,I bought this for my 2011 Ford Ranger. It fits the visor great and is of good quality! Has plenty of storage space for documents and what not. I have no complaints. I would recommend to buy and you can't beat the price!
4,Folk Rock that never sounded better,"This live CD is an example of folk rock at its greatest. The sound quality is almost perfect. There is plenty of humor between the songs. The rendition of ""Teach Your Children"" even sounds better than the studio version because the audience is included and there is not so much noise from the electric guitar. I believe that more songs could have been included in this collection. Some examples might include ""Our House"" and ""Just a Song before I go."" However, this recording is a great introduction to this group."
4,solid,"I like this album, but I have a problem with the medley (consisting of three solo Neil Young tracks). Each one of them has been shortened dramatically. ""The Loner"" is now a short, acoustic slow song. ""Cinnamon Girl"" is better, perhaps because I prefer a version of this song that doesn't rock (not a fan of the studio version at all). It's better this way, believe me. Now we can hear the song with solid singing to back it up instead of lazy guitar riffs. However, this version of ""Down by the River"" may be the ultimate disappointment. While the vocals are good, this song is supposed to be a lengthy electric guitar jam. That's not what we get here, unfortunately. I don't have a problem with the rest of the album, though. It almost works as a greatest hits album when you think about it."
1,very disapointing,"I had great memories of the times and LP version of this CD set.I just bought it, to go with a serious stereo.As they said back then, what a bummer.The engineering is terrible. The vocals distort to the pointof being unlistenable.And for a group famous for its close harmonies, how come no one can sing in tune?Skip this live CD, find a studio version where they couldactually hit the notes, and where the producercould make them cut out the mindless drivel andextended, pointless jams."
1,"Too Old, Too Late","A big disappointment, the artists doing this album. They're just too old and tired and they sound like it on this album. By the way I'm as old as they are but I know better than to try the same things in the same way, that I did when I was much younger."
3,WISH IT WAS MORE,"Actually it reminded me a lot of Heinlein's ""The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress"" but without some of the snap, crackle, & spark. The characterizations were not as engaging."
2,Perspective is too personal,"When I bought this book, I hoped to learn more about Isis and ancient Egyptian beliefs. What I discovered was one Wiccan's personal interpretation of the material. I was disappointed. I was seeking hardcore information, not a soft interpretation. The rituals are modified Wiccan rituals. but If you happen to be of Wiccan persuasion, and want to wear an Eyptian costume, this book might make you feel Egyptian. This book will make a beeline for my trade-in stack of books."
4,Don't listen to those other jokers,This game is really good. It has lots of pieces for if you lose them. I reccomend it.
