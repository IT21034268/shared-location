2,Water on the bottom side of a bowl...,"Uchida's performance resembles water poured on the bottom side of a bowl: instead of the music coalescing into coherent sound, it is rapidly driven to ridiculous extremes. The performance is frenetic, almost vulgar, in its unrestrained variation in tempo and dynamics---I hear none of the carefully weighted precision, poetic restraint, and sensitivity which defines Debussy's music. It sounds as though the music is being used as a showcase to display Uchida's overbearing virtuosity and fiery bravura. This makes listening to this CD more like a trip to the circus than an authentic musical experience. Perhaps her talents would be suited to a more theatrical and romantic composer, for instance Listz. I wish I could recommend this CD, as the Etudes are extremely beautiful and quite under appreciated. However, I came away from it feeling as though Uchida was more in love with the impressive movement of her fingers than with the sound of the music itself."
2,"Pretty thin to be considered ""tough""","These bags fit my garbage cans great but they are thin! Not tough as you would expect with a company who prides themselves on being tough. Without fail, every time I put something in the bag, it rips. So I am constantly having to stick the ripped back into a new bag to double bag everything.These seem more like liners than garbage bags. I thought they might be worth a try, but it didn't live up to it's name.....at all."
5,This book is not a book. It is a people!,"Me too. I am a Latino in the USA. I am a character in AMERICAN DREAMSWhile dazzling the reader with amazing turns of phrase, Gonzalez Viaña moves gracefully from hope to challenge and onto nostalgia, courage, adventure, and finally to love.This book is not a book. It is a people!"
5,Well constructed shoes,"Great shoes. I shopped and shopped for plain white sandals for my daughter. Everything had characters, sequins or an accent color. We wanted plain white !!! These shoes are comfy and well made."
3,"No es el mejor, pero es bueno...","Tras alcanzar la gloria... Robe (alma de Extremoduro) se ha atrevido con un disco experimental... que finalmente se ha quedado a medio camino....Para muchos es el mejor, para otros muchos el peor... Seamos sinceros... a pesar de buenas canciones... NO es el mejor...si queréis lo mejor de extremoduro haceros con Rock Transgresivo e Iros Todos a Tomar Por Culo... un directo buenísimo :)"
1,Ugh...,"I seriously don't understand why people think having big breasts makes someone unpopular, self-conscious, think they're ugly, miserable, lonely... Having big assets is absolutely nothing compared to other superficial things that create emotional problems and low self-confidence. Like being overweight, too shy, a stutter, acne, or some other facial or skin problem. Those are the things that cause self-consciousness. Not ""big assets!"" My God! If people really think that's a problem, they have no idea what it's like to truly feel ugly.This being said, along with the fact that this book really WAS written like a teenager's diary, as another reviewer pointed out, this book was not worth reading. And, although Teresa's so-called problem was not a big deal, Brian was still a jerk."
2,Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?,"Purely on the merit of hearing one of their fab early singles on the radio, I took a risk and bought this album hoping for more of the same. Save track 5, what I found however was a real horror story of a let down- an atypical sterile eighties sound barely redeemed by the intermittently thought provoking lyrics. A poor mans Smiths, I consider this group to be the most over rated 'under rated' band of the eighties and regard said album as personal insult to a purhaser who spent three hours flipping burgers in a hot sweltering kitchen to pay for it."
4,Great music that deserved a wider audience,"I actually heard more about the group than actually heard their music. With all the rave reviews, I figured they were worth hunting down. After listening to this compilation, I'm intrigued by some of their other albums. The Go Betweens have a great, breezy, intelligent pop-rock sound, a bit like the Church in fact. My favorites here are 'Streets of Your Town', 'Dive For Your Memory' and 'Draining the Pool For You'; the rest of the CD is great as well. As for people upset with the artist's 'egotistical' liner notes; it looks to me the artist was simply proud of the music and was justifiably upset being passed over by lesser lights. Nothing wrong with that attitude; maybe if other groups had it, the dreck would disappear. This CD is highly recommended for those who want to escape 80's mush. It gets quite a bit of attention when I play it. Now if only the powers that be would reissue '16 Lovers Lane' in the U.S. ..."
1,Junk,"Never again will I go through Northern Tools. Even got a scond one on a return. I realize it was ""slightly used"" when you buy refurbished but these were beyond what I thought they would be. Not worth the money or my time."
2,my first impression / disappointed,"finally i got my paint sprayer.gone through reading a lot of reviews and finally settled for reconditioned Wagner sprayer. unfortunately unlike others, mine came look very dirty and used. i could probably cleaned it better. still see some white paint inside of transparent hose as well as inside of pail container.the gun has sharp knick at handle. who was responsible for quality control. it might been randomly checked or possibly one of those friday afternoon production. i was disappointed as soon as i opened the box. if you expect to see something close to new, mine has definite look of used machine. not thoughly cleaned. i purchase a lot things from amazon but this was the worst ever in years. add one more note: the two screws and butterfly nuts hold the handle was missing.e-bay sells better things than this."
1,"Reconditioned Wagner 0515000T Spray Tech 2,750 PSI Paint Crew Sprayer - Piece of Junk","Not only did I throw away my money on the Reconditioned Wagner 0515000T Spray Tech 2,750 PSI Paint Crew Sprayer, but I wasted time and ended up very frustrated with this item. It worked for the first 2 gallons of paint, and then inexplicably refused to spray. The motor was running all the time as if it was having to constantly build the air pressure, but then the paint would just not come out. Oh, it worked fine with water, if I wanted to ""paint"" my walls with H2O.Never mind telling me it was an issue with the paint because I was spraying from the same 5 gal bucket. My contractor did tell me that the problem was common with that model, and that Wagner had fixed it in a subsequent model.Thinking back, perhaps that's why it was re-conditioned. Someone had returned it after experiencing the same problems like I did.Anyway, it's now part of the landfill."
1,"Service, what service","I hope to get the chance to re-write this review, but I purchased a Reconditioned unit about 4 months ago. The first time I used it, it bled paint down my arm - bad seal in the trigger mechanism. But I liked the spraying that I was able to do. So I drove it down to the Wagner service center - - and here I sit, six weeks later, still with no gun. Guess I shouldn't have done all of that sanding on the patio (still raw wood). I've been told that they are going to replace my gun with another reconditioned unit, and I should have it in a week or two. So if you do purchase one of these, I hope you never have to have it serviced."
4,Wagner Power Painter,This wagner power painter exceeded my expectations for what i recieved. It was a great value for what i paid to paint my home exterior. Will purchase more wagner products in the future.
2,Works well before it quits,"I have been succored into buying 2 of these machines. The first worked well in Florida using Latex Paint. It completed ceiling and wall painting brilliantly for 80% of our 1600 sq. ft. home until it stopped spraying and no amount of cleaning flushing, kicking or swearing has made it work again. We also bought one in the UK but that produced truly awful results (streaking mainly) before it too stopped. Probably great for lighter paints but under-performs with anything with guts."
1,"Sorry, can't give good review because.>>>","When I received this and went to watch it one side of the DVD will not play..at all........i won't order any more movies from Amazon again..I get good quality & low priced classics, quick at [...].....Hope this helps others,,,,,,,,"
3,Some good songs,"There are some good songs on here, such as ""Love Buzz,"" ""About a Girl,"" ""Negative Creep,"" and ""Downer."" However, Nevermind and In Utero are magnificent albums that make you want to listen to them again and again while Bleach is just something to round off your collection if you want every Nirvana album."
4,VERY GOOD ALBUM,I WISH THEY RE-RECORDED ABOUT A GIRL AND SLAPPED IT IN ON AN ALBUM BESIDES UNPLUGGED. I LOVE WHEN A REVIEWER CALLS NIRVANA AN AVERAGE BAND. LOVE THEM OR HATE THEM THEY ARE BY NO MEANS AN AVERAGE BAND YOU MORON.
3,"Bleach buyers, make sure all the songs are on your album!","Nirvana is my all-time favorite band, and a great great album Bleach is. I bought this album on CD in 1993 when I was 13, and still play it to this day via CD or as MP3. I ordered Bleach on vinyl through here the second I saw it available. UNFORTUNATELY, the copy I received does NOT include Big Cheese or Downer, thus, it's last song is Sifting. So for those of you who will be ordering this album in vinyl off Amazon in the future, make sure the seller has copies that include the complete track listing."
3,I Need An Easy Friend,"This LP proves beyond any doubt that Nirvana was more than Kurt Cobain. Without Dave Grohl at the drum kit, Nirvana sounds like a thousand other grungy metal bands. The sound on BLEACH is more raw and less powerful than on the big label Grohl-drummed records that the band would do later.Still, Cobain was a certifiable Rock genius and the formula that he would perfect on NEVERMIND can be heard on ""Downer"" and ""About A Girl,"" which resurfaced on UNPLUGGED a few years later. ""Love Buzz"" sounds faintly psychedelic, but the overall vibe here is young, fast, and razor sharp.But I gotta wonder...who is this ""Kurdt Kobain"" mentioned on the album's credits? Kurt Cobain's bizzaro world twin?"
3,Ilove myself better that you,"Well I do not what to say because ,you know NIRVANA is great we can still having kurt alive if we remember him with his songs his music the most important thing is that you enjoy it"
4,square dancing in a blender,"... so this is nirvana's first album. most people dont own it and should. with standouts like the beatlesque aboout a girl and the dynamic negative creep this album is great. one stroke of genius is the song school where cobain sings the same word somewhere between ten or fifteen times but you never notice because of the different ways he sings/screams it.the music is gritty, part melody, part noise and somehow always good. kurdt had a knack for taking pop-like melodies and combining them with his altenative/punk side and making really different songs. i felt he was a true artist and bleach is a begginning. there is room for improvement but for a first album ...it is a a fine piece of work. from the punk rock political song of downer to my favorite in floyd the barber, bleach is one album that rocks"
5,BRILLIANT,"This is so good. It shows Nirvana's passion in the best possible way. This just rocks, buy it!"
5,Absolutely up to standard,"I highly recommend this album for Nirvana fans and everyone else, too.It has a visceral, angry feel to it that is somewhat smoothed over in Nevermind. The guitar riffs are compelling and there are several solos which show Cobain's incredible talent. His vocals are also more savage, deeper and rougher, than in later albums.Fans of the subtler songs like ""Dumb"" and ""Lithium"" will probably be disappointed. But if ""Rape Me"", ""Stay Away"" and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" are more your thing then you should take a look at Bleach.All in all, an excellent album!"
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Nirvana kicks ass, but this cd blows it. The reason i gave 2 stars is because i liked about 10 seconds of the album."
4,Great album!,"A very good album from Mudhoney, the recording is not the best (sounds like recorded in a garage, but it also makes you get a feeling of youth!) the music is great,One of my personal best of mudhoney"
2,very disapointing,this mudhoney cd isn't all that great. piece of cake is a good mudhoney cd. pass on this one.
3,From Back Cover,"Martina Logan dangeroulsy shared a passionate affair with her family's nemesis, Noah Coltrane. But when she became pregnant, Martina was determined to have the baby alone. So, armed with baby booties, she stood he ground.Seeing this vulnerable beauty, swollen with his child, made Texas bachelor Noah fall head over spurs, and ring in hand, he stormed her door. This was one Logan he was determined to make a Coltrane!3rd in the Lone Star Families: The Logans series"
2,Too small,"It says weighs up to 500 grams, but you can't put that much on it, it's way smaller than I had thought."
5,Great!,This is the perfect scale for weighing all your little bags out. Is pretty much the size of my iphone so it actually does fit in your pocket! Completely true to picture.
4,You get what you pay for,"This is a cheap scale, so it works okay. for the most part it does what i need how i need, but its when I am off by a slight amount that it becomes touchy and sometimes will read new material and sometimes not"
5,Great Scale accurate to,This is a great scale for $6 it is accurate a penny weighs 2.5 grams and i tested it and it ways 2.5 gram great scale and was delived fast got here before it was supose to
3,As Usual,"Good price, decent scale, but as usual the scale weights 1.1 when a dollar bill is put on it. Transit damage. Least it weighs"
3,pros/cons,"Pros: its tiny and very portablecons: it messes up sometimes when you recalibrate it to the dish, it has a slow response time, and sometimes when I'm adding weight to the scale it does not interpret it, and i have to take the whole plate off and recalibrate it and then put the weight back on.all - in - all. if youre looking for a cheap scale to use every now and then i would recommend it. if youre looking for a scale for everyday use, i would not recommend it."
4,Not Bad,"If you just want to have a scale around to weigh how much you personally have, then this is adequate for that. However it has to be on a completely flat surface to work and the weight is measured by 0.1g instead of .01g so it's not completely exact."
5,"Small, but works great","This thing is small, it was definitely is smaller than I was expecting, even though it says how small it is you probably won't get it till you see it easily fits in your pocket which can be a plus, even though it makes it somewhat hard to weigh your 'kitchen spices' but I just fold up the bag it's in and it usually isn't a problem.As for it's accuracy it is great, nickel weighed in at 5.0 grams, the lid weighs exactly 9.0 grams and no fluctuations in weight as some people have reported, has trouble weighing under 0.3 grams but that's not a problem for me.Overall not the best scale, but the only other scale I had jumped around in weight, couldn't weigh anything under 1.5 grams, and didn't have a battery lid. That one cost me $20, so your getting a good deal here, with shipping it comes out to $10, and if you can deal with it pocket size it's great especially for the money."
4,Accuracy Means Nothing Without Calibration,"Great little scale for the price. The only problem is that when I weighed something I knew the weight of, the scale was off by 1.5 (or so) grams. The scale can only be calibrated using a 500g calibration mass. While they say the device is accurate to +/- 0.1g, it's not a precise measurement if the device needs to be calibrated right out of the box. Either spend a little more on a nicer model or buy a calibration mass to go with this."
4,Its okay.,weighs better with stuff over 1gram. I bought this to weigh things between 0-2 grams and it isnt always accurate unless therse a lot. for some plastic this is a pretty moody scale..
3,Worth the price,"Nice product, after 2 years still working, but the accuracy when you are using it for decimals is not that good, it may take a couple of seconds before giving you the exact weight"
3,Works well - but it's too small,"I bought this to weigh hops for home brewing. But for the purpose, it's too small. I have to jerry-rig a platform so I can put a container on top to hold my hops. Then, the container gets in the way of the display.If you're looking for a scale for weighing items that are not dense, (like food, etc) you'll be better served getting something different. But if you're weighing small, dense items this should work pretty well for you."
3,it works good,its just made a little cheap i would not want to drop it many timesbut it does what it says
4,good little scale for the money,does what it needs to fits in pocket very nice and seems to be very accurate. this is a great product and a great buy
2,its a scale but remember your only paying 9 $,when you get a penny and put it on a scale it should weigh 2.5 but on this scale it weighs 2.6 2.4 but sometimes it weighs 2.5. the point being this isnt the most precise scale if your looking for something that allways weighs right pay a few more dollars and get a better one.
3,It's okay,I do enjoy using this scale but it is not good for mesuring small weight under 3 grams. I tried mesuring .1 or .2 and it will work sometimes. other than that if you are weighing more weight it works fine.
3,reasonable for small quanitities,"small like it says, couldnt use it for what i originally wanted. was good for other things, and is not the highest quality product"
5,Excellent product,This scale paid for itself after mailing 10 small packages. The cost of postage is now too high to round up weights.
4,Digital Pocket Scale,This product was used for children to practice weighting. It is very comfortable for everyone to scale a small quantity.
1,does not work,"It didn't work! Well, it was so inexpensive (about $5.00) that it is not too big of a problem What did I expect anyway for that price? I guess you get what you pay for."
4,great for weighing espresso,I always weifgh espresso beans before grinding. Having the accuracy down to 0.1 grams really helps in achieving consistency in the espresso shots. The scale is small enough to not take up too much space on the counter.
4,kenslapsalot,"consistantly just .1 off but who cares about that. i mean it one run all the way up .1 off, just the final outcome will be, .1 off. but grreat scale for the money!"
1,Bad,"THis is a really bad scale i bought it and it worked for about 3 weeks and then it broke. I even tried changing the batteries and it still didnt work. I never dropped it for it to brake,"
2,"little scale, no help for calibration, not really worth it","Yes it's cheap, but I could have wasted my money elsewhere. I gave it two stars because it does, sort of, give you a ballpark weight. Unless you are weighing only tall narrow items, the object being weighed will interfere with the scale. You are likely to reset it in the middle of weighing something. As one amazon shopper to another, buy something else."
5,Small accurate and a great buy!,"It's limited on size and total weight to be weighed, but this little scale is inexpensive and accurate not to mention it's about the size of a deck of cards. I recommend it!"
5,Very good,"It works very well its been pretty accurate, the only problem is that you need to put at least a gram on it first for it to start registering."
5,Paradise Bay,"When I saw this book, I did judge it by the cover, and I thought it would be a pretty good book. So checked it out from the local library and read it. I have to say, I couldn't keep it down, I kept reading till I was done. This book keept me reading from cover to cover. This is an amazingly written book, the idea and plot is unthinkable. This book is worth reading, infact it's worth owning. It would be a pleasure to read it over and over again, which is why I reccomend this book. Rating this book five stars was a mistake, it should be ratied ten stars or a hundred stars, or infinity stars. So if you are looking for a fantastically-great-full of adventure-never put down to stop type of book to read, I more than recommend this book."
1,Not up for a bad mystery!,"This P Fitzgerald book proved that, unlike what I precious thought, I do NOT like everything she wrote. I loathe mysteries to begin with, silly whodunit tales, and this one bored the pants off me. Skimmed and/or skipped a large part of it. Even her writing couldn't save it from itself!"
1,Dimestore effects,"The idea of this video is that there are a bunch of beautiful chicks who are vampires who take off their clothes. So far so good. Unfortunately, they spend an inordinate amount of time in their flowing robes making vampire snarls with their dimestore fangs. The photographer, who is also the director and thus is entirely to fault for this sorry video, evidently missed the first day of film school. All of these girls are back-lit, mostly in smoke, and all are writhing slowly as if they suffer from advanced arthritis. Sometimes they are out of focus as well. Perhaps not being able to see all of this clearly is just as well. There is no story or plot, which is fine in a nudie video, but they don't seem to get down to being nude for but a few minutes, so one wonders what's the point. It certainly isn't art, unless you want to fall for pretension as being somehow related to art. I won't waste my time viewing this again."
5,Wonderful DVD - Benson,"I have been waiting soooo long for Benson to come out on DVD. I happened to check, by accident, when I saw the DVD listings for Soap. The episodes of Benson are such classics. And so funny. I didn't know that Susan Harris, who wrote for The Golden Girls, wrote for Benson as well. I can see a little in both. Funny story telling from the Governor. Somewhat similar to Rose's Saint Olaf stories on the Golden Girls.The packaging is good. It's the first season. Nice set of three DVDs. I love it. I really hope that they put the next season out soon."
2,"An okay compilation, nothing new or surprising","As a big fan of the Late Night Tales/Another Late Night series, this is one of the more disappointing ones, almost down there with the Snow Patrol collection. The best by far are Kid Loco, Belle and Sebastian, Air, and Tommy Guerrero."
3,More of a Comment than a Review,I picked up this book because of the press on it and the knowledge that it was written by a Muslim woman who spoke out against the atrocities committed against Hindus by Muslims and vice versa. I can't really say anything about it that hasn't already been said.I wouldn't even be posting anything except for the amusing comment by P. De Angelis about there being no mention of the Twin Towers. The copyright of this book is from October 1997 - several years before 9/11........
5,Introspective.,"For a land-bound Arkansas boy, BEACH WALKS opens new vistas of nature and beauty that I have not experienced as a way of life but only in passing on too-quick vacations. But Thatcher's introspection transcends the Coastal life to all who are one with God and nature."
3,Needs better editing....,"I got this book eagerly anticipating it to be updated from 1998. Unfortunately, it was not - several notable omissions (e.g., The Sports Connection in LA), several outdated entries (e.g., The Firehouse in LA), and ther choice of spots to pick and those to omit (such as Minneapolis) make this ediiton little different than the last.That being said, this is the best overall gay travel guide around. It keeps in line with Access Press excellent manner of organization, with good maps and reviews. I just wish the contributors and/or editors would have put more time into reviewing the choices and making sure they were current."
4,Finding Pleasure in the Old West,"This is an interesting book regarding how Indians, explorers, trappers, soldiers, miners, and pioneers filled their leisure hours. It was well-written and well-researched. A writer would be able to turn to it for ideas for their own writing."
3,Beat Happening Have A Lot To Answer For,"Their minimalistic pop music was revolutionary at its time, but their incessant plugging of the same old ideas has yielded countless incompetant musicians who believe mugging and wearing cute clothes is equivalent to making an artistic statement.So, thanks for nothing Beat Happening, but thanks a lot for this album which, along with Daniel Johnston's early work, and the Shagg's opus, create the triumverate of beyond basic pop love.Album: 4 stars.Beat Happening's impact on music, resulting in lots of pretentious, annoying, entitled white kids dressing up like Doby Gillis: 2 stars."
4,Engrossing Read,The idea that a group of people could give up years of their lives in the pursuit of something so obviously fanciful as a pole to pole circumnavigation boggles the mind. I started to read this book just to understand what made these people tick; I continued to read because the book is well written and a great adventure tale. I recommend it highly for anyone interested in modern adventure and/or polar exploration.
3,cute movie,It was a little cheesy in the beginning but we gave it some time and it turned out to be cute.
3,A Christmas wish list for improvements,"The acting is a little rough around the edges. The customer is the antique shop looked like she was reading off of cue cards. Roger Moore is fantastic, and the male lead reminds me of Cary Elwes so I can't find any fault with him. :) I wish they had more money for wardrobe and hair/make-up. Sometimes it looked like the actors did it all themselves.The real gem here is what I believe to be Peles Castle in Romania, used for the exteriors. It onced belonged to the Romanian royal family. I'm not sure if they also used the castle for interiors as well. The pictures I've seen don't match up to anything in the movie. The interiors are great though, and seem really authentic. This alone is worth three stars."
4,A little different than most Christmas stories,The acting was done well. The storyline flowed. I liked it enough to buy it after I had already seen it.
1,Torture to Watch,"This movie was the worst i have seen in a while. The torture in the movie makes you want to figure out the who, what and why. It left me very puzzled until the last few minutes of the movie then you get a better understand. Im glad i rented from the RedBox a $1 was all this movie was worth. Truely not a must see again."
1,Poor product,"I purchased a GO Video portable DVD player, model # DP 5040. After using it 3 times, it would work sporadically or not at all. The plastic locking latch broke off with normal wear-and-tear. I would NOT recommend buying this product. What a disappointment since it all happened AFTER warranty expiration!"
1,omg this gun is expensive!,"This airsoft gun looks awsome but like $1,000 for an airsoft gun that shoots as fast as my $90.00 airsoft xm8 semi/auto and has a few extra parts. if you sold this for a cheaper price i would buy it in a heartbeat."
5,DSD is the best way to go!,"A WONDERFUL, soft and healthy moisturizer that will keep your skin refreshed all day and night! I even had a makeup girl at Bobbi Brown tell me how soft my skin was. She told me to continue using whatever moisturizer I was using and not even bother trying the high end Bobbi Brown moisturizers. I'm glad I stuck with my DSD! After cleansing and toning, this lotion really helps give me a fresh look. The combination of DSD products on my skin makes me look younger and I'm only in my early twenties! I'm using DSD forever :)"
3,Not up to Ms. Jackson's usual standards.,"I loved ""Deep Freeze"" and was looking forward to this sequel but was very disappointed. There was little character development, except for the girl, Dani. She was also the only one I really liked. There was no chemistry between Travis and Shannon. Shannon's brothers were jerks. Robert, the serial cheater, the worst. He humiliated his wife and his children with his very public affairs. The resolution of the plot just stupid. Shannon gave up her baby when she was 20, old enough to make her own decisions and not try to blame it on anyone else. Suddenly, she's a loving mother to a kid she's not even seen since she was ten minutes old. While she was referred to as Dani's ""mother"", Travis's late wife, who was Dani's true mother in every way that mattered, was rarely mentioned."
1,Political brain washing,"Some legitimate ideas are indeed presented here- but with a thick left spin that makes it hard to see the truth- if there is any- in what the author is trying to get across. Dissapointing, considering its reputation as a good book to learn from."
1,"heinously liberal, severly misrepresented facts","I found this book to contain a severely liberal, green peace, treehugger bent. Facts are taken out of context, particularly the facts pertaining to global warming. While humans have indeed increased our emissions, in what context is it taken? When compared to the emissions of the natural world, our own are less than one tenth of a percent. Our obsession with beef represents a greater danger to our environment than do our industrial activities, by the authors logic. I would definitely NOT recommend this book for those of sound mind. Brainless liberal zombies, carry on, all hope for you is lost already. A teacher I had once long ago, said that he was not impressed with this book and wished that they could have done a little better checking facts and present the information more factually, without the subliminal agenda. He told us that there was a better book out there that presented the facts better and had far less political bias than this book does."
5,Earns the Prestigious Rosetta Designation from Penguin Guide,"I first read of Mozart's piano sonata recordings by Uchida in the highly-acclaimed Penguin Guide to Classical Music. The Penguin Guide to Classical Music is, in my opinion, the most authoritative guide. The guide gave these recordings a perfect score and the prestigious, rare Rosetta designation, which means that the recordings are beyond a perfect score. It means, in the opinion of the editors, that the recordings are unusually sublime.I am writing here that I agree."
3,"Overpriced, but you can't get it anywhere else","This charging cradle works as it should for the Sonos Controller, but it is very overpriced, considering that all you get are two pieces of plastic. An adapter is not even included, as you use the adapter that came with the controller. A functional product, but worth perhaps 1/10 of the price. Good news is that it comes for free with the ZP80 bundle here on Amazon and for free with both ZP80 and ZP100 bundles direct from Sonos."
5,What happens to Damon?,"I love this series of books. They are my favorite. I first read them in sixth grade and recently read them again in college. One thing I don't understand is the ending. I really think it is open for a fifth book which would make me so happy. I always wanted to know what happened to Damon. I loved his character and I think he deserves a happy ending. Is anyone else with me on this? I think a book following Elena and Stefan and what they've done together would be great- and just my personal idea- but wouldn't it be great if Damon got together with Elena's sister years later- like they all save her from another evil while she is in high school (Like the Smallwoods) and he falls in love with her and makes her a vampire and the couples stay together. I don't know, just an idea."
5,"No matter what, I thought this book was great!","I'm surprised that so many people didn't think this book was a good ending. I thought it was so great, I cried. That part where Stefan was so heartbroken over Elena at the end, then she came back was so moving. The part I didn't like was that Elena came back human. How much sense did that make? It's not like she could go back to her town again, anyway. I never thought of the possibility of a 5th book, but that would be so great! I recently realized just how fortunate I am to have all 4 books in this series, because everyone says they can't find them. I highly recommend anything by LJ, for anyone who liked this series"
5,Great hooks,"Very handy to be able to hang your coats were you need them,(near front and back doors)."
4,Deanna's review,"The book is (Eyeballs for Breakfast) and the characters are Ashley, murphy and Iggy. The setting is mainly at his friends house. But most of it happens at Ashley's house.But Murphy and Ashley don't get along with each other.The main idea of this story is Ashley and Murphy that they like each other and there showing it in a mean way because, Ashley is telling Murphy that she is better then him in some ways.But sssssshes not there both good at the same things.In my opinion I think the boook is the best thing I have ever read or got read to. This book effects my life because the stuff they do is simalar to the stuff I do."
4,Lauren opinion,The book eyeballs for breakfast was written by M.M Ragz.The story begins with a boy name Murphy.Who is always getting annoyed by this girl name Ashley Douglas.The purpose of this book was to entertain.This is a chapter book.The main idea of the story was to be kind to others.I learned that you should not lie because either way someone is gonna find out.Plus it would make life a lot easier if you tell the turth.Also be open to everyone's idea's.Pius you should listen to your parents.Murphy and Ashley were very mean to each other.They are always fighting all the time.They are not a like at all.Murphy could have tried to be more kind to Ashley.This is nothing like my life.
3,jennifers great review,"This book is called Eyeballs for Breakfast.The main characters are Murphy and Ashley.The setting is at school and Murphy and Ashley's homes.The problem is Murphy and Ashley can't get along.The solution is they try to stay away from each other.This book shows cooperation because Murphy tries to get along with Ashley.It shows respect because Murphy tries to respect Ashley.Honesty is shown because Murphy takes the blame for his actions.The teenage difficulties are with school and trying to stay focused.My opinion is this book is okay.Irate this book with a 3.This book can make me fall asleep.The lessoned learned is you should try to get along with those who you may not like.But thats my opinion,you should read it yourself for your opinion."
4,Jeremy's Online Book Review,"The title of the book I am reading is"" Eyeballs For Breakfast"".The main chactors are Murphy,and Ashley.The problem is that Murphy put Ashley's hair in the paste.Thay don't get along at all through the first part of the book.In the second part Murphy's dad who is a gym coach meet Ashley's mother and father in town.Thay planed to go out for dinner and to leave Ashley and Murphy together,and thay have fun and become friends.The author of this book is M.M Ragz.This book inspired me because it show's what not to say to a girl.It shows that you should always eat your egg's and stay in shape.To do all my projects in school and turn them in."
3,Jessica's awsome online book review,This book I am about to takl about is Eyeballs for Breakfast.Its trying to say work together and be cooperative.This has at least fifteen characters in it.The main character is murphu and he's pretty cool.The author of this book is M.M Ragz.This book teaches you to be responsible for what you do and your actions.The part where he was responsponsible for not eating candy when he was on his diet.You need to be good to your self and dont lie(that dont get you anywhere)like the part where he kind of didnt tell the teacher when he erased the chalkboard.Thats not really a lie but it wasn't the truth.
3,Heh?,"Without using unappropiate language, this book [was really bad].... Like what I read, this book was not packed with action. I do not recommend this book to the people out there who want nonstop blood and conflict after conflict. I would recommend this book to those people who always want happy endings. Really, to me this book was really boring. I had to read this for school, and the title looked good, and when I read the back, it sounded good. Well, shows that the saying, don't judge a book by it's cover got me this time. The vocab of this book is kind of weird. You would have to be at least a teen to read this. Other than that, don't even try."
5,Big Girls Don't Cry,"This book was borrowed to me and I have to say I simply could not put it down. From the start I was draw to the characters and began to feel what they felt and thought. As as British black woman I had no trouble relating to the trials and tribulations that took place and felt a strong affinity with the main character. Connie Briscoe has, with her written works, inpsprired me to aim higher and not give in. I tell my children that they can be anything they wan't to be and so can . Thank you for very inspirational peace of work."
3,"I'm ready for my close-up, & my close-up, & my close-up!","Since this is one of the plays thatI rarely get a chance to see performed, I was rather looking forward to watching it. The performances were wonderful, even though I thought Marc Anthony appeared a bit of a wimp and Cleopatra a frustrated lady (forget that stately strong woman Liz Taylor projected). But, I guess Shakespear saw them as two desperate people.Whoever directed the camera angles should have his union card revoked. The whole production is shot in close-ups, so you never get a chance to step back and take in the scope of the whole play. It might be a stage play shot on video, but an actors' performance is more than the movement of his eyeballs.Well, at least I got to see this play performed. Minus two stars for hiring an amateur cameraman."
3,When Nunn Was Still Green,"If you have seen Trevor Nunn's work in Twelfth Night, you may be curious about his screen version of Antony and Cleopatra; however, there is no comparison. Nunn's A & C, while competently vocally performed by all the actors, did not appear to combine Method acting with Cicely Berry's voice direction which resulted in a tedious and disappointing filmed version of a stage production. Neither Janet Suzman nor Richard Johnson are able to evoke the passion expected from these characters. However, Nunn's casting and direction were much improved by the time he produced the filmed stage production of Othello with Ian McKellan, Willard White, and Imogen Stubbs which is available through Amazon UK (but only in PAL format)."
2,Dated Rendering of Familiar Story,I read elsewhere that this was the best rendering of the famous play available on DVD. The performances and the appearance seemed very dated and almost amateurish.
5,"Cold? More like, just right","The earlier review has some merit, I suppose, in saying that the pieces are cold...both composers were writing in the Romantic/Post-Romantic time period. However, we need to keep in mind that these pieces were written by Smetana and Franck, NOT by Strauss and Wagner (jalapenos instead of habaneros). In the performance these pieces, there SHOULD be something of an element of restraint. Otherwise, it falls over the top and is, well, icky. Both of these pieces were very personal pieces to the composers, so it seems unlikely that either of them would have wanted the peforming quartet to be melodramatic. I HAVE heard ""cold"" readings of the Smetana...this simply is not one of them. It is just right in temperature. And in intonation and ensemble work - it is dead on."
5,Great value!,"I haven't had an equalizer since 1979 so I had to reaquaint myself with their usage.This one is a terrific deal for the money,for like most electronics , it would have been much more money years ago.It real shines when trying to brighten up the sound of cassette tapes since their high end is lacking compared to CDs.I do not use it for newer remastered CDs because I find nothing amiss with their sound;however some older CDs are definitely improved with equalization.So if your music collection is a mixed bag of old and new recordings,do yourself a favor and pick up one of these!"
1,complete waste of money!,we haven't had this product for even a week yet and the baskets won't stay in place (they slide down the pole) and they're already rusted! we've had it for five days now. total and complete crap! do not buy this product. i'm taking it back today
4,Great music,I own 5 of the Kitsune Maison compilations at this point and #4 definitely doesn't disappoint. I am a huge fan of the very last track in particular. It's broken out into three songs and I love them all.
5,A New Addition to My Top Three Sales Books,"I read lots of books on selling. I've read some great books by people who've never sold anything and lousy books by great salesmen, but this is the first great book I've read by a great salesman. Selling to VITO is the first sales book that I need to carry with me to use for reference. Most sales books provide lots of theoretical knowledge that the reader can HOPEFULLY apply to real selling situations. Parinello delivers a book with REAL things to say and things to write. He tells you what to do and what order to do it in.In order to apply the material in this book, you will need to understand how to translate his examples into your selling situation. Tony helps you with this by giving you a mental process to work through the translation.There's no fluff here. If you are serious about corporate sales, don't miss this book. It won't be easy to follow the instructions within, but if you do, the results will be profitable."
3,Crafts for over $10.00,"Really enjoyed this book. Has some really great craft ideas, but the title is misleading. Unless you are a heavy duty crafter, these crafts will cost more than $10.00. Most list small numbers of things to buy, then farther down the page, it lists things you already have at home. These things usually include embroidery floss, fusible web, needles, fiberfill, buttons, etc. Some of this stuff I have at home, but only because I tend to collect craft materials just in case. There are some materials that I do not keep on hand that would definitely be quite pricey to buy on short notice... Be sure to read all the way through the What to Buy and Things You Have At Home for each craft before you start."
3,Mostly for completists,"This is interesting mostly for Ella's attempt to try out some different material. The Burt Bacharach-Hal David tunes suggest that a full-length songbook of their work might have been worth considering. And she does well with ""Cabaret."" But ""Spinning Wheel?"" Well, she and Sinatra were trying to fit into the contemporary music scene.It's clear why this concert wasn't released at the time it was recorded in 1970: the sound quality is only so-so and Ella was in only fair voice. Nevertheless, it's one of the last opportunities to hear ""Mack the Knife"" on record and pianist Tommy Flanagan is outstanding as usual. And for once, Pablo gave the First Lady of Song an album cover worthy of her place in music (compare the worst: ""Fine and Mellow"").But as a souvenir of an Ella concert, there were better ones before in Rome and Berlin and better ones after in London and at Carnegie Hall in 1973. Seek those out first if you want to experience the best live Ella recordings."
3,"Good Read, But Poor Editing","Reading the quotes from the players and management really allows a Mets fan to see events from new perspectives or confirm what you thought to be true (i.e. ""The Midnight Massacre""). The only flaw in the book is the poor editing. Two examples, Butch Metzger was listed as co-Rookie of the Year with Pat Zachary which is true, but he wasn't a catcher for the Astros as the book states, but a relief pitcher for the Padres. It also later states that Steve Henderson was leading the entire American League in hitting before coming to the Mets which is unlikely since he played for the Reds minor league team in Indianapolis. They probably meant American Association."
2,Golenbock is better than this,"In his customary fashion, the author wrote forty-five informative and entertaining chapters. Unfortunately, the book has fifty-one chapters. The last five must have been sub-contracted, as they bear no resemblance to the rest. Only one subject, Al Leiter, is interviewed for the last six chapters, and the clear writing and insights disappear. There is no ending - he just stopped writing.This shopper will purchase future books by the author only after waiting for reviews and careful inspections, steps not needed until now."
2,strange,"Let me get this straight. Golenbock interviews six or seven Mets, quotes EXTENSIVELY from past Met biographies and autobiographies, and turns it into a book. Where's the effort?Almost all the quotes are lifted, with the bibliography hidden in the back. Very unimpressive journalism."
2,An Unbalanced Film,"As stated in my discussion, Trumbo was a communist for many years...and stayed long enough to help oust many American communists from the party. These were Americans who did not wish to tow the Stalinist line after the war. It was this fact, that made Arthur Schleshinger Jr., who like me, was anything but a red baiter, to write in the Village Voice, that he thought Trumbo, to be the ""last person"" who he would consider to be a defender of free speech. These were his words: ""the LAST PERSON"". This film's researchers did not do a balanced job to bring out this irony.The film's producer in the discussion, wishes to create a feel good, self serving, smoke screen about these facts. I understand that Trumbo was hounded out of Hollywood, and should not have been, and that he suffered and perservered, yet this film does not state the whole truth."
2,Not very good for support,I have tried this product on 2 differant sofa's and can not say it helped much at all.I will try another one and see if that will help.But for now....I would not purchase this product in the future.
2,Maybe it's just ours,"We are still using the sofa support we bought, but it does not seem to have helped that much with the problem of sagging. Maybe it is just our sofa - maybe it's just too far gone, but I think it needs even more support."
2,Sagging Sofa Support,this product would do it's job if it was for a loveseat. It stated it was for a sofa but it's too short and not wide enough. My couch still sinks.
4,Helps Some,"It helps with the sofa, but not as much as I hoped for... In any event if was worth the money."
4,sagging couch support,Good product. It works well. I would recommend it to others who have a sagging couch cushion issue. I have nothing more to add.
3,It's ok,It helped a little bit. I guess I expected more support from this product or maybe I need new cushions.
3,Not big enough!,"I have a 2 cushion sofa. Not only was it not wide enough (my couch is pretty wide so I can expect that), it;s not even long enough. I should have listened to the other reviewers about getting a piece of plywood. I put it under the cushions anyway, and it still seemed to help a little bit. I think this was meant for one of those old-fashioned mini couches. I think it may have somewhat worked if it was big enough. I still gave it 3 stars because it was my fault for not measuring."
2,MMPR Rocky just wants to have fun,"This episode was pretty dumb.Did I mention how bad Rocky was at red ranger, he was good when he was the blue zeo ranger but not red. Tommy was the best as zeo ranger 5 red then Jason even though he was the original red ranger but anyway this episode is about when Lord Zedd casts a spell on a game Rocky semms to enjoy and now he just wants to play alll the time. Also did I mention how Rocky morphs funny as red ranger and the way he calls on his zord funny but anyway this video was pretty dumb but buy it if you want to listen to how rocky morphs(haha)"
2,Not the best,Not as powerful as I thought it would be. Batteries don't last as long as I thought they would. Leaks when laid on side. Don't drop it.
1,Wish I could get my $21.99 back...,"After reading 3 reviews, I decided to buy this CD and I did ... Thanx a lot for guys wrote the reviews making it sound like it was a CD of well-known punk/ska Goldfinger. This is Goldfinger & MUSHPOTATOES (which is really hard to see). Darrin doesnt even sing song #6 like the other review says. If you are expecting this to be one of ""Punk"" Goldfinger CD, it is not!!! So DON'T BUY!!!"
2,thrilled and then deflated,"This is a fabulous film...long had I awaited the DVD version of this film, and when it finally appeared, I jumped and bought the DVD.Alas, I was SO disappointed because the color and sound quality of the DVD format is POOR! There is NO EXCUSE for crappy color and sound quality in this day and age!!!!And there are NO SUBTITLES/CLOSE-CAPTIONS!!!!!! Again, in this day and age, not having subtitles, or close-captioning at the very least is RIDICULOUS!!!!!! It is insensitive to the deaf and hard of hearing community (many of the latter of which are us aging baby-boomers, so it is age-insensitive as well).Fortunately, I still have the VHS and will keep that so I can view this wonderful movie on a BETTER QUALITY, though out-dated, format...at least until the tape pops...Geeesh...save your money and stick with the VHS if it still available."
2,It works...sort of.,"Instructions are virtually non-existant. You must reverse engineer installation process to figure it out. Overall, the product quality is poor. I will not re-order this product when it fails, which should be any time now."
5,GREAT STEP SAVER,I HAD ONE OF THESE MAIL ALERTS FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS AND FROM DAY ONE INSTALLATION I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS THE BEST STEP SAVER I HAD EVER SEEN. MY MAILBOX IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD AND IT WAS TOTALLY INCONVENIENT TO KEEP CROSSING THE ROAD AND FIND THAT THE MAIL HADN'T ARRIVED YET. THEN ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO MY NINETY YEAR OLD FATHER IN-LAW MOVED IN WITH US. HE LIKED TO GO AND GET THE MAIL. IT IS GREAT TO KNOW THAT WHEN HE CROSSES THE ROAD THAT THE MAIL IS IN THE BOX. THE REASON THAT I HAD TO REPLACE IT WITH A NEW ONE IS BECAUSE THE TAG THAT HOLDS THE FLAG DOWN BROKE OFF. I FEEL THAT IT LASTED A LONG TIME AND WAS HAPPY TO REPLACE IT WITH A NEW ONE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO ANYONE LOOKING TO SAVE STEPS.
4,Replacement mailbox flag,"Product was a replacement for one that broke. It is fine except the spring, that works the flag, isn't as storng as the previous one and doesn't raise the flag as well."
5,Hot tiips for Facilitors is Hot stuff.,"This book is a gem. Clear, explicit, to the point. It is a fun read and the advice is easily understood. Minimum jargon, maximum readability. Recommended."
2,Unacceptable Audio Quality,This CD exhibited unusually poor audio quality (excessive noise and other artifacts) significantly detracting from the music. A full refund was requested and granted.
2,ugh,"In some places, the playing seems rushed and in others, it sounds uncoordinated. There are better versions of these sonatas out there."
3,Uneven but has it's Moments,"The inherent problem in this recording is inconsistentcy. At times it almost reminds me of a ""previously unreleased"" comp recording. The opening track will do nothing but confuse the uninitiated--a noisey number titled ""Crisis"" that abrubtly slows down and is in fact hard to listen to. However one should continue on because the next track ""Brand NewLove' is amongst the best songs of the 90's. It accurately projects Lou Barlows--folk come--punk attitude.Other standouts include the Nick Drake cover of ""Pink Moon"", ""Vampire"" and the amazing closing track ""Mind Meld"". This record would have been a 5 star ep if some of the fat and filler had of been trimmed. However it still has it's moments of genius and is worth buying if just for 'Brand New love""."
5,a wonderfully composed materpiece,"throughout my life i've read many books and wrote several papers on the holocaust.reading this book not only changed my view on where and how the physical setting took place, but it made me feel as if i were reading something that was not yet released to the public(ie. professors). the visual pictures are graphic and so are the effects on your mind. this book is by far yhe best book w/historical significance and moral significance. I would recomend this book to college and high school students alike. and to the kids who enjoy reading but dont have time, the book is fast paced( the opposite of most books with a lot of meat)."
1,Arrived with non-stick peeling off,"This pan arrived with the non-stick coating already peeling off the top inside edge. Also, had a bump on an inside corner that didn't have non-stick on it. The packaging was fine. This was a defective product."
1,Not good,"Sorry, I really wanted to like this game but compared to Sim City and other city builders, this game is not good. My computer freezes up constantly and I have to continuously reboot, etc. and it still doesn't work. I'm afraid that your money is not well spent here. Good service from J&R though!"
2,Nu-Metal? Anyone?,"Okay, I'll first admit to not having heard the whole album, so I could be wrong. But judging by their MySpace songs, the album gives me a ""Nu-Metal Updated for 2006"" vibe. I listened to a lot of nu-metal back in the day. Now I'm over it, but I know it when I hear it. Maybe its the vocals, or the standard song structures, or the..ahem..southern riffing? Anyway, I feel like I would have really liked this when I was 13 but now, not so much. Also I liked what I heard better on their earlier albums. Just thought I'd bring this up since no one else has."
3,only half way pleased,"A large drain opening in the spoon allows water to drain easily and quickly. But , it also allows pasta to fall through easier. A smaller drain opening would have been more useful"
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!,"I have lived in Central Virginia all my life, and have eaten plenty of the fare from this book. Ms. Lewis emphasizes quality, variety, and to take the time in life to enjoy the foods we eat and love. Every recipe in this book have been carefully created. Many old, and a few new. I recommend this book to anyone wishing to taste the perfect flavors of good ole fashioned foods, and authentic, country southern cooking."
5,Beautiful book,"This is really a nice book, whether you're looking for ideas for your property or just a coffee table book you can't go wrong. Worth every penny."
4,Does exactly what I need it to,"While it's not the best karaoke machine in the world, for the price it's a really useful product.There's really no need to push video through it. I hooked my computer (working as a DVD player) directly into the TV, and that provides the lyrics and the background music. This machine then hooks into the stereo to provide the vocals. It's basically just a vocal amp.The sound is pretty good, and the echo effect is sufficient. Now, if only I could sing..."
1,KILLS BEES,"Inside the front cover, where generally no one looks, is a small warning that this product KILLS BEES! What kind of freaking company makes a ROSE AND FLOWER spray that kills bees?!? It's the same concept as mouse bait - putting poison in mouse food, except it's going to kill off bees that pollinate most of our foods! Is Bayer trying to accelerate the extinction of bees? Considering this product, maybe Bayer is responsible for the bee die off!More than one-third of honeybee colonies in the United States have died over the winter for the past four years. At the same time, about 30 percent of food needs pollinators.Save the bees, and keep eating delicious natural foods. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
4,"Best of the XP series, but still wordy",The books in the series have a lot of whitespace and are chatty andrehashes of each other and this cuts down on the amount of information they impart. Contrast that with Steve McConnells books.This is the best book of the series with some great ideas. They addressed many of the software engineering concerns I had.
4,just a loaf pan,"it's not rocket science, but it sure works good. easy to clean as long as you don't let it sit too long afterwards."
2,only good for casual use.,"I make whole grain bread every day. This pan is fine if you don't want to keep the bread in it, but for me, it was a total disaster... within two weeks, they were completely rusted :(."
4,Great,"I love the surface of these pans, super smooth and easy to clean. Only downside was that it warped slightly after the first time I used it (in a 425 degree oven, Fahrenheit). Not a big deal to me since it was not expensive and it's still definitely usable."
2,Great pan.,"I have used this pan in a couple of different ovens. It does resists warping compared to all the other pans I have used. It heats up uniformly even in an oven that heats unevenly compared to some other non stick pans. It works great for cookies, cinnamon rolls, biscuits, etc. It's very noticeable to feel how well it resists bending. The non stick coating works great, so far.I do have one slight problem with it. At a certain angle in the right light, the coating seems to have imprints of the swirls/circles where the cinnamon roll/cookie has been even after washing the pan multiple times by hand. This is very minor, but enough for me to give it 4 out of 5.UPDATE 10/11/2011This cookie pan is terrible now. It buckles at 350F after a couple months of usage. At first it never buckled, then one day it buckled after a batch of cookies. Nothing else but cookies were used on it."
3,The soundtrack for a rainy afternoon,"Like sparkling apple cider, tastes may differ, but I greatly enjoyed the 20+ minutes of the first track, nothing wrong at all with the sound quality. Tracks 2, 3, and 4 do unfortunately suffer from varying amounts of dynamic range inefficiency (to put it nicely). The rest of the tracks lie somewhere in between.Regarding the performances, this is finely improvised avant fuzz-jazz and if you're familiar with Robert Wyatt (and keeping in mind that *this* is what he left Soft Machine to do) then you'll know Matching Mole emphasizes mood and attitude over structure, and values coloring outside the lines over following a score.I assume I'm writing this review for fans. If you know nothing of Matching Mole then I would recommend starting with one of their studio albums (or even Soft Machine *Third*) to provide some small, fleeting amount of context."
5,Wish they came in a smaller box,"We are set for erasers for quite a few years! All you need is one per pencil - it will last the life of the pencil. They fit tight and are made of a much more sturdy rubber than what is sold in stores nowadays, making it easy to choose function over form (attractive color selection of the cheaply made eraser caps in stores)."
5,Complex Enough for Me,"I am always looking for piano music that sounds impressive, takes some work to learn and play, and gives my fingers a real workout. I absolutely hate playing EZ sheet music, so what I'm looking for is not easy to find, as most people want to be able to sit and play something immediately.Some of this book's piano music is accompaniment, so not very interesting to play; but there are still enough good, moderately complex pieces that make this book worth the purchase (as well as their other books, most of which I bought). I don't know music levels. My niece and I both played some of it immediately upon getting the book, and it sounded pretty good."
5,awesome,"my mom swears by these, and got all of her children (8 of us) two each for Christmas. so far, so good!"
5,Godd heavy duty pan,I needed a second muffin pan without breaking the bank and this was a great choice.
5,farberware nonstick muffin pan,"my best muffin pan EVER. i havent seen anything stick to this pan yet. i always spill batter on the top outside of pan, and with this pan, it just falls off once its dry. doesnt leave a stain either. its every bakers dreamware. lol"
5,the only eraser I will use,"This is the only eraser I will use. It leaves no marks behind and will remove some of the hardest pencil marks. you will definitely want four - if you only have one, you will be rue the day you get caught without it or leave it behind.extra tip: to prevent the blue paper sleeve that is around the eraser from deteriorating, wrap it in clear scotch tape."
5,Reference Recording,"Anthony Pay's rendition of the Mozart Quintet is one for the ages. A flawless performance well worthy for the title of being the reference benchmark recording of the piece.The quintet, a beautiful piece itself indeed, is played here with an incredible warm tone brought forth by not only Mr. Pay but the string quartet as well, led by violinist Iona Brown.The other unforgettable recording of this piece out there, Dave Shifirin's rendition, is also a classic, but a completely different rendition than Pay's. The preference over which performance is better is completely up to the tastes of the listener. Sihirin's version is more clear, where this one is, as I have already said, more warmer."
1,Utter disappointment,"I am a very large fan of Mr. Davis, and would say that his recordings of some of Mozart's other operas (Cosi, Die Entfuhrung) are among the very finest. But in my estimation at least, his Don Giovanni is a complete failure. Weak orchestra, sketchy cast, total lack of any real drama or tension in the direction. I really can't think of any thing about this recording that would merit someone spending any amount of money for it. Stick to Furtwangler's 1953 recording or better yet any of Karajan's (1985 is the best, but the 1970 and 1987 Salzburg Festspiele recordings are also quite good)."
1,A Nice History Of An Early Business,I thought this book was very insightful and must be regarded as a serious history book of the founding blocks of American business. Of course certain parts were more exciting than others but it delivers what was expected : a very well written account of an ever changing business during the earliest days of recorded westward expansion to present. I salute the author for what must have been an incredible amount of material to put into a sensible chronology. I enjoyed it thoroughly and think it is underrated.
5,Beautiful story of acceptance,"Even though the setting is a Korean-American family, ""Secondhand World"" by Katherine Min is a universal world we all live in with the inherent tragic relationship of being born as parents and children. The angst-ridden life of the teen age protagonist Isa, her isolation, estrangement, rebellion and the final end evolves beautifully in Katherine Min's highly disciplined style of writing with a lyrical flow. Reading her story towards the end, I felt like lying next to Isa in the snow covered field, feeling for the first time hopeful for her future and wishing her my best. In the final analysis, this is the story of acceptance, how one learns to accept the irreversible conditions of his or her life."
3,Sub Pop creates an aura,"Another Sub Pop compilation filled with as many ""lesser"" bands as household names. Not quite the quality (in the music or the packaging) as the Sub Pop 200 re-issue, but a nice snapshot of what came to be known as The Grunge Era.Unfortunately, the overall quality of this (and other discs like it - not to mention the individual band catalogues) serves as a constant reminder just what a boring musical time we live in now. Nothing lends weight to music like a ""music scene,"" and the folks at Sub Pop played the Seattle angle to the hilt. Lucky us they did . . ."
3,Promising Writer,I liked this book but I didn't love it (Horror/Scif Fi are not my favorite genres). I think the writer has a lot of potential but thought he could use a good editor to aid with organization and streamline the whole thing. There's lots of imagination here and the writer really knows his genre. A good first effort. I look forward to seeing how this gentleman progresses.
3,It's OK,"Nice story line, but too many grammatical errors. Remember that ""it's"" is only used for ""it is"" not as a possessive."
5,Love the product- too expensive!,"Crayola Crayons are the best! Although, I noticed the price on here is more expensive than they are in most stores. If only I'd noticed before I purchased them!"
4,Think Different! Escape your Office!,"For most users, MicroSoft Office is overkill. They're talked into using by people that tell them that HAVE to run it to be compatible with the rest of the Office world. Not necessarily! Unless you're an Office Power User that needs and uses the extreme features of Office, iWork will do everything you need it to, and still be compatible with your Office workmates.It's much faster on the Mac than Office, MUCH cheaper, and much more reliable. I write semi-professionally, and have never had any problems with using iWork, or had any problems with being compatible to my Office users.You can download a free trial of iWork to see if it's what you need before purchasing. Granted, it will not work for all, and there is a small learning curve that is required with all new software applications. But, if you are willing to give it a try, you may find that there is life after Office and you can save that money for something else!"
3,No ODF support,iWork can't open ODF documents or save to ODF format. Saving to more other common formats such as RTF is a bit more difficult than simply setting a one time user preference.
5,Souvenirs - Souvenirs,"Great compilation of Johnny Hallyday's first songs. These songs correspond to the beginning of the French Rock n' Roll. Also, ""Souvenirs, Souvenirs"" is the song which changed the meaning of the word ""copain"" during the 60's in France. It was referring essentially to people who love rock n' roll. A magazine and a radio program named ""Salut Les Copains"", produced by Daniel Philipachi, came after that. This CD reflects a page of french music history. It's also a collection of fun and sweet songs.I recommend it for all ages."
5,Easy clean up,I love these pans because you do not have to scrub them and they do not tarnish..I am trying to replace all of my bakeware with farberware..
1,Pay attention to the specs!,"I purchased this device to use with a TomTom model 910 (purchased at the same time), to facilitate moving between vehicles.This particular unit will NOT work with model 910."
5,Excellent hard to find item.,"This HollywoodFashion tape keeps things in place,is easy to use,goes through the wash,and can be reused.Keep blouses and sweaters closed without any telltale sign."
2,ok product,I purchased for my daughter for a christmas dance....didn't work well... tape kept coming off and her dress keep coming down...I wouldn't buy again
1,Swimming Instruction,I was not happy with this book. I had hoped to get a book to help me teach my children to swim. This book was mainly philosophy about the YMCA with VERY little information on steps to teach a child to swim. It was not helpful at all.
1,misleading photo,"OXO Good Grips Stainless Steel SqueegeeThis item is shown in photo with a hook (see photo, below blade @ handle) but is shipped without same. No option for ordering of hook offered. I am considering returning it as it will not serve it's intended purpose as well without hook to hang in shower."
2,Suction Cup Holder Doesn't Hold for Non-glazed Tiles!,"I have always loved Oxo products for their innovative and ergonomic design. I especially purchased this Oxo product due to my previous positive experience and the innovative suction cup holder to hang the squeegee when not in use. The suction cup did NOT work for my travertine tiles! It keeps falling down after several hours. I called Oxo and was told that their suction cups only works with non-porous surfaces and would not work with travertine or marble. The packaging did NOT state this disclaimer. What a disappointment! I am sending it back and getting something else.I FOUND A WORKAROUNDFor those who already bought this and experience the hold issue with non-glazed tiles, one way is to stick the suction cup onto the side of the tub. This works well."
5,Product Recommended,Product works perfect. Suction cup keeps the squeegee on the glass shower wall and it doesn't fall off. The Squeegee is of good quality.
2,it was a disappointment,We had owned previously a OXO brand good grips ( only plastic )and thought that the stainless steel version would be a nice upgrade. We loved how our plastic squeegee worked and felt in our hands. This squeegee is very uncomfortable and awkward to hold. You have to press very hard in order for it to clean the area without a big streak in the middle.
5,iPod to TV cable,"Works as advertised. Connected ipod to 61"" HDTV. I can't believe how clear photos and movies look. I thought for sure with the movie's ipod format the movies and photos would be blurry on such a large screen, but they look great. Cable length is good enough to control ipod and still be far enough from the TV, even a large screen. Would recommend to others."
4,A good source for this subject matter.,This book contains valuable information for any pianist or keyboardist. Much of the basics of human anatomy and physiology with regard to playing a keyboard instrument are clearly presented. Recommended reading.
4,A riveting look at a history that never was.,"In Pacific Empire, G. Miki Hayden makes this alternative world and the people in it come alive. The characters, even the villains, are well-rounded and ring true. And the prose is truly eloquent."
1,Leaks with cheesecakes,"My issue with this pan was that it leaks. Instead of my cheesecake batter remaining in the pan, it ended up on all over my counter. I have never had any trouble when creating this cheesecake using my Ekco springform pan but I wanted a taller cheesecake. I should have known ""if it's not broke don't fix it."" Lesson learned."
5,"Fiannally, some GOOD soulful music!!!!!!!","My brother-in-law digs this guy and took me to see him when he performed in Central Park a little ways back. GREAT SHOW!!! The music stretches across the soul spectrum: funk, gospel, R&B, it was all there. ""Eleven More Days"" was what stood out for me. I picked up the CD afterwards and found all these great tracks that he didn't play: "" I Got a Name"" and ""Fanon"" are two of them. Definitely a good buy if you dig soulful music on the Sail Williams and Gil-Scott Heron tip."
5,No Substitution!,"There is just no substitution for the Pink Pearl eraser. They are long-lasting and are the cleanest and most reliable erasers I have ever used for schoolwork or art. You can't go wrong with the three-count for the price Amazon is selling it for, and I highly recommend this product."
5,These are the best. Period.,"These pink erasers have stood the test of time. We have bought some crummy pencils with useless erasers and have needed and used these every year. Yes, we ONCE made the mistake of buying an off brand--do not compromise. Just don't bother. Others will smudge or break apart or tear your paper. The size of these is great too--many traced or pencil drawn projects need to be gently erased before they're turned in, and these make quick work of erasing even large posterboard projects. Two pink thumbs up!"
4,Ok if you're not a beginner,The only problem I had with this book was the cooking skill level and the time it took to make the meals. I'm not that great of a cook and I work a lot of hours. This book does have a lot of info about cooking different ingredients which I found usefull. If I have more time I would definitely learn a lot from this book.
3,AudioSource EQ200 10-Band Stereo Graphic Equalizer,"It worked perfectly...but not delivering the perfect sound that I expected. I will continue to test the component by adding a CD Player or DVD Burner. Overall I am very satisfied.Thanks,Ernst Etienne"
3,Review of same unit made years ago,"I have this model of EQ, but it was purchased about 5 years ago, and may be of better /USA quality. In fact, I still use it, and it works great!I have been looking lately to purchase another equalizer, but have noticed that they are getting hard to find. Best Buy used to have them (no more). Fry's used to have them (no more). Crutchfield used to have them (nothing shown online). WTF?!?!?!?!?From the reviews, apparently the quality on this unit has gone downhill (can you say China?). What is especially strange is that I bought mine at Best Buy for about $100 (you know, $99.999999). And now they're listed here for over $300?I see a good business opportunity here, manufacturing quality equalizers for the US public...."
3,"I thought it was perfect in the beginning,","and it was. But soon it started to make this awful noise that kept me up at night. I had to put Abby (my dwarf hamster) outside of my room at nights, and I hated to do that. So I had to get rid of it. I replaced it with a silent spinner, and so far that's done well. As someone had stated, this wheel isn't big enough for Syrians, but perfect for dwarf hamsters. Let's just hope yours doesn't end up like mine - trash."
4,"Good resource, lots of ideas","I have always found Vanna's books to be a valuable resource of ideas.Her patterns are usually easy to intermediate so I can do them with easy.Fairly large print so that reading is easy.Note that most of her stitches for her patterns can be found elsewhere, but the way she puts the patterns together and the way she writes the patterns is the assest of her books."
3,Not as good as the other,"when I saw this book coming out, I rushed to order thinking it would as great as the other 2 Vanna books are by Leisure Arts. I was somewhat dissapointed as the title says gifts but almost all of the items are afghans with a few sweaters and a really ugly pair of slippers thrown in. Also dissapointing is the fact that most of these projects are stitched using Lion Brands most expensive types of yarn. One afghan calls for 10 skeins of their yarn that sells for ... a roll, pretty hefty. While I do enjoy making these costly projects for special occasions or special people, I would not reccomend this book if you are looking for quick gifts you can make for a reasonable amount of money."
3,If you're studying fashion this is a five star book,"I was slightly disappointed with this catalog. I was hoping for more house wares (dishes, sewing machines, porcelain ware etc.) and the prices for these itemsIf your interest is for Fashion clothing, jewelry, linens etc. this would be a valuable resource."
3,Seems to be high quality but....,"I would have liked to have seen a picture of the bottom of the board before I purchased it. Turns out this is a ""10 degree"" board which means the ball on the bottom that creates the rocking motion is very small. It is much harder to do one-legged work on this board so I am returning it and trying to find one with a much bigger ball on the bottom."
3,Tyler Perrys House of Payne 4,"First few episodes brilliant then it started to wain, but overall pleased with the series and I am now addicted to the series."
3,good,it was packaged well and it came on time! thank u so much. i just the delievery people need to be more careful with the products
1,The oven ate our cake,"I agree with the reviewer who complained that the pan leaked batter.In our case it leaked batter all over the oven. There was no way to""lock"" the bottom and sides together. Ours will also go in the trash."
5,EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED!!!!! YEAH!!!,"I'm very happy to receive items as described. I bought these for my cousin who is a teacher at a public school as anyone knows most of these teachers do alot of stuff on their own with their own dime. Well, my cousin is a teacher at the public school and it's overseas which is even a bit more tighter with their stretched out budget. Anyhow, i picked these up with some pencils too & she is HAPPY AS A CLAM and the quality is just nice. I will go back for more very soon. Thanks so much"
4,Essential for greater understanding of the Deadlands.,"This hard-to-find expansion to Wraith: The Oblivion is a great addition to a Storyteller's library. It goes deeper into the backbone of the society of the dead. From ferrymen to the Deathlords and their Seats, and everything in between. You won't have any questions about the Hierarchy after reading this book."
3,Good for the price...,I picked up the straight edge today and for being 440 it has a nice factory edge. I have not noticed any lose screws that some of the other reviewers are having issues with but I am having the opening issue. The reason the knife doesn't want to open easily is because on its liner lock it has a little ledge that sticks into the blade to help prevent opening up in your pocket. I am sure removing this will fix that issue. Other than that I have only 2 other complaints. The aluminum the handle is made out of has absolutely no grip so the moment your hands get wet or sweaty anticipate for it to slip in your hands. And my other issue with it is I would like it to be tip up carry with the clip. My reasoning behind that is when in your pocket you can have the finger guard that sticks out on the blade catch on your pocket having it open with very little effort. That having been said it is still nicely made and looks great and for the price it is a decent knife.
5,"""While Supplies Last""","Another reviewer gave this pan high praise and, rather than repeat it, I will simply agree. Although my preference is for cookware with long handles, this is one pan you can take from stove to table. With trivet underneath, it makes a fine serving dish.There is only one thing you need to know: Buy It Now. (Which is exactly what I did at a certain auction site and, even with shipping costs, paid a few dollars less than the thirty-five Amazon priced it on a Friday sale.)A note of caution: this pan may be made in either Toledo, Ohio or China. In my experience, the quality of the Calphalon cookware is better in the Toledo products (such as the one I have) and if Amazon can tell you the country of origin, so much the better. Regardless, this is a substantial pan that will be used for a lifetime.But one thing is certain: Calphalon is discontinuing the Commercial hard anodized line of cookware and this is one of the few pieces left in the series, at the time of this writing."
4,wonderful energy to practice along with,"The cons:- not much by the way of safety pointers which would be useful to real beginners. The DVD would be fine for ashtanga practitioners that already have a teacher and wish to supplement their practice with this DVD at home.- no modifications are offered which can make it unapproachable for about 95% of the world's population.The pros:- Richard Freeman has a wonderfully soothing voice to practice along with. For a home practitioner like me, this is very important. I never get tired of listening to him. The rhythm of his voice, the calmness of his expression and the active effortlessness with which he approaches the asanas is inspiring and sets a wonderful example for how to approach yoga."
3,Beautiful Voice.,"The CD is certainly worth owning. It is rich with beautiful music, however, it is not a Vienna Boys Choir CD, it's a Max Emanuel Cencic CD. His voice is wonderful, but if you're after the choir, you may be disappointed. I added it to my collection and I'm glad I did, however, there are better Vienna Boys Choir albums including Max Cencic as a performer, i.e. Voices of Angles.Buy it with caution!"
5,Love it!,"I really like all of the Shannon McKenna books I have read. Again, this one didn't disappoint. I love the characters, their strengths and flaws."
1,Not worth your time,"No endearing characters, typical story line. So many other good books out there, skip this one (and the whole series!)."
3,"""Dark as a pocket""","Though she may have been providing a detail for the room Mrs. Hoaresham was held helpless in, main character Karen Beatty, in actuality, summarized her entire life by describing the room as ""dark as a pocket.""Karen knows nothing more about her life than a complete stranger on the street. Her mother died when she was young, her father has managed to stay a distant figure... Karen's memories of childhood consist of one boarding school after another.Suddenly, Karen is instructed to leave school, which initiates a long journey, toward her father and more importantly, to herself. With the help of a childhood friend (Jay) and Mrs. Hoaresham, an animated and generous new friend, Karen is able to escape from her fictional relatives and find her father, along with a strength she never knew she had."
5,Hilarious Movie!,I thought this movie was so funny and really enjoyed it. It is an adult movie so DO NOT let kids watch this because there is alot of nudity and sex scenes. It has alot of sex humor in it which was great and made me laugh all through it. I can't believe I never heard of this movie until I saw it in the video store! Enjoy.
3,Not for beginners....,"I looked through this book, curious to see if there were any Mexican recipes to try beyond the ever-present Taco Bell variety (not that there's anything wrong with that). This is a very good looking book, the recipes are detailed and sound delicious, however, without actually making anything, I have a feeling these recipes are not appropriate for the beginning cook. You would need many ""exotic"" ingredients not commonly found in many areas of the country; the recipes are very labor intensive; one would need a very good kitchen fan to deal with all that roasting of peppers; you are sternly advised that no substitutes are allowed. Fair enough, this is authentic Mexican cuisine. Maybe when the weather warms up I will track down all those peppers, etc., buy a pair of rubber gloves, and open up the windows and make something...authentic."
5,This is a great cookbook,"This is a great Mexican cookbook. I can't recommend it enough. My husband asked for it on his birthday and since we like the dishes so much I plan to send a copy to my sister for her birthday. I find the recipes have a wide range of complexity and time required to prepare them. Although I will ""cheat"" and buy tortillas for my weekday menus instead of making them. We especially liked the Chipotle Chicken Salad Tacos which is a very quick and easy recipe for the weeknights. YUM."
5,An Obvious Labor of Love for the Author,"Obviously a labor of love for Mr. Bayless. This book is inviting to use, I think, because of its user-friendly lay-out, the stories, illustrations and photographs, and, of course, the wonderful, wonderful recipes.Pinching pennies is my way of life so I rarely plunk down $$ for a new cookbook. But I did plunk down lots of pennies for this book and I have no regrets!"
1,defective right out of the box,Well ours worked for about 10 seconds and that was it. Called the number provided BY Neurosmith and it has been disconnected.....sent an email to the customer care line....returned. And there is NO Neurosmith web site either. Thank goodness Amazon is accomadating...or I'd be stuck with a crummy toy.
2,"Love the toy, but company out of business!!!","We have owned this for two years and love it!!! However, Neuromith stopped making these products (hence, the low, low price) and cartridges. So, if you want a cheap toy, great. But you'll get no support from the company. Unfortunate, because they really did have a wonderful line of toys!"
2,A little disappointed...,My son had the earlier version of this toy from approx 10 years ago. We purchased the updated version for our younger daughter. The sound quality is not even close to the first version. It now sounds like a toy. The original version was MUCH better! Still a great idea but very disappointed with the output and sound quality.
3,Not what I was looking for,"Not what I was looking for, I am sure it is a successful plan for most. It is just not my cup of tea."
5,A Must for getting started in any weight loss adventure!,"I got this book a couple years ago and it hasbeen a mainstay in not only breaking bad food habitsbut learning how to eat healthier and live my lifein more balance. What I love about Linda is how she writesfor the common person. No talking down to you or preaching...no over-the-topmedical terms that can boggle the mind--she tells it like it is...ina down to earth and enjoyable manner which makes sense. And having a daily doseof power...is all you sometimes need when you have alot of weight to loseor just a few pounds. Ms. Spangle understands that it takes time to breaka bad (eating) habit and this little gem of a book will be one you keep whenyou toss out all your other so called diet books--this isn't about a certaindiet, its about learning to live with food! Great purchase--both her books are!I not only have them in book form...but this one in my Kindle as well!"
3,Helpful if you can commit to it.,I had couldn't remember to read the next day's chapter. Especially during the weekends. I ended up putting it down. But it had some sound advice.
5,Rossini Overtures,"This is the best Rossini Overtures album, ever. The sound is great and the performances by this Italian orchestra are exemplary. This is far better in every respect than Chially's performance with the National Symphony and much better than the recording by Saint Martin's in the Fields. Go for it."
4,The Twelve Days of Christmas,"Certainly worth the price is the Canadian Brass version of ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" - track eleven. Everyone I've played this for enjoys it, whether they are classical fans, Christmas music fans, or neither. A real treat for classical fans, though. The other tracks are what you would expect, brass Christmas standards. There may be an issue with the audio mix, though, as I could never get the voices (on the tracks with a choir) to sound right."
2,"Good topic, super boring writer","Interesting book, good history collection, nice details but bordering on too many really. Mr. Green is not what you call a fluid writer. The man will beat you down. I would have liked this topic and these facts in the hands of Adam Gopnik or Malcolm Gladwell."
5,A MASTERPIECE EVEN AFTER 12 YEARS,"This is my favorite CD ever. This is the masterpiece of the 1990's. Every lyric is beautifully captured and Jeremy's voice is breathtaking, sad, masterful, happy, angry and everything in between. I truly love this album. best song here is ""Song About An Angel"" I cry everytime. my band covered this song and everyone was in tears after. pure emotion."
3,I was dissapointed...,"I was hoping for more tunes like ""Seven"", but found a less than amazing guitar riffs."
3,Number of discs,"One thinks that come three discs, but two movies come one disc. Addition to, the faces of the discs come in white, appears discs burned."
1,Very Basic,"Average bag, contents are very basic.You can print the list of contents and purchase on you own for 1/3 of the price."
4,Remaining a PC Cast fan for sure!,"I fell in LOVE with PC Cast first book, Goddess by Mistake, and have stuck with her ever since. Persephanie and Hades is one of my favorite myths. I have been wanting to do a retelling of it myself, but it looks like she beat me to it...though my version was a little darker, so I still may give it a go.This was a wonderful love story I think. It told the REAL meaning of love to me. I will admit I was a little thrown with the end, but it works and was still a wonderful take/tale. Playing with the Gods and Goddess's will always be an adventure."
4,Very Entertaining if You Don't Mind Interpretive History,"If you liked the movies 300 and Gladiator, Spartacus will be right up your alley. On the other hand, if you are looking for pinpoint historical authenticity, you should probably stick with the History Channel. The story lines and characters are well-developed and worth the investment of your time. What I especially appreciated was that the villains are multi-dimensional people that you can understand, if not identify with. This is a very violent series, as you would expect from the title and the fact that most of the action takes place in a gladiator school, however, the violence is somewhat stylized and not as bothersome as you would find in slasher pics."
2,mediocre at best,"I read all these really high 5 star reviews and I'm honestly scratching my head. The plot is too plain, the characters all speak like they're in any high school (yes your kids speak like this). Sure I can see where people are into the sex and violence, but there are better movies and series for both. It honestly works out like a poorly written graphic novel. I watched this because it was highly recommended by a coworker, a coworker that I can no longer accept the opinions on media from. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but it looks like I'm in the minority. Save your money for a series with a good story like Game of Thrones."
1,Terrible!,I purchased this series based on the good reviews - bad decision. I ended up only watching 3 episodes and then stopped. This is not Rome or anything close to it. It's a cheap production that has some dim-witted actor playing Spartacus when the historical Spartacus was far more. Don't waste your time with this series - read Barry Strauss's book.
1,Very Bloody and Graphic.,The story and premise of the show sounded great. I am a huge fan of shows like Gladiator and others. This one was not worth it with all of the Sex and Blood. You can make a great cshow without all of the added garbage. I know some people think you need this in the shows to make them sell but you dont. I would definetly not recommend this show at all as it is a total waste of time.
1,Not quite what I thought it would be,"I felt that this show was kinda like a multi-hour version of Gladiator (with Russel Crow). I liked Gladiator, was not as thrilled with this version of the story. However, if you only need to see topless, almost nude women, you might be more inclined."
1,humm,"truly truly awful. A miniseries seemingly designed by committee. Corny, cliched, unoriginal, hammy, peurile, clumsy and vacuous. A Rome of gleaming teeth, waxed chests, soft porn and zero talent. Buy I Claudius or Rome instead."
5,hang in there...,"The first couple of episodes are over the top, really cheesy and almost made me not carry on.. but after that WOW with every episode this show gets better and better. Yes, there is a lot of nudity and sex and blood and violence, but it is just an awesome show. Many episodes have had me at the edge of my seat, even standing a few times shouting 'OMG! NO!' ... give it a chance (if you like this time of show) you wont be disapointed!"
5,spartacus blood and sand first season,enjoyed this show very much i saw it on cable and fell in love with it had to get dvd for my collection. pt 2 looks good but not the same actors but will watch any way and may order that also if it is good.
2,Great Show.........until the end,"I bought all three seasons from Amazon and was watching Blood and Sand .... all was good until the very last episode. I put in disc 4 and my PS3 says it can't read the disk.....what is up with that. Now I have to go to Amazon instant TV to watch the last episode. I am not sure how Amazon handles issues like this, but I will update this review once I find out."
5,what movies are supposed to do,"I do not watch movies as a form of Education as the opinion of the producers and actors is subjective and History or facts usually take a beating. I watch them for entertainment, and Spartacus Blood and Sand is exciting entertainment that removes us from the boring sameness of our now controlled lives."
3,Not For Me,Much to much blood and gore. The simulation of severed heads and limbs is way overdone to my way of thinking.
5,more nudes from lucy lawwless,series was great relistic in series only thing more LUCY LAWLESS PUBLIC HAIR SHOW A LOT BOOBS DID SHOW LUCY LAWLESS REAR END (@$#)
5,AWESOME,ok i got this and i watched it all night and went in to work late the next day with no sleep. This was the most epic series i have ever seen. i could not push the stop button. a must have
4,spartacus,sex and violence with a story line that keeps you going. great casting.all three seasons were done very well.i havent repeated any words and there are twenty already there
1,REALLY BAD!,"I admit I only made it thru the first 20 minutes of this disaster! It is really awful - fake backdrops (obvious), horrible stilted acting, the language is ridiculous and almost comical, blood flying around in slow motion, etc.Apparently Starz was attempting to make another ""Rome"" and it is a miserable failure.Don't waste your $$ and time.How anybody with half of a brain can give this mess 5 stars is beyond me."
4,Very entertaining...,If you like sex and violence or one of the two you will enjoy this show. Its a lot of fun to watch. The blood splatter cracks me up because they intensify it which makes in look over the top. Good show.
5,I love Spartacus!,I love this show. The dvds came in great condition. Anyone who watches one episode will get hooked on the series.
5,"great series, could not stop watching",This series is great. It caught my attention from the first episode to the season finale. The violence and adult material might offend some people but I believe it truly reflects this period of time. It also adds to the captivation of this series. I can not wait for Spartacus to return.
5,Addictive fun,"Once you watch one episode you have to finish all. Even though violent and brutal it is hard to turn away from the characters' deceits and corruptions to see their resolutions. When not involved in the plot, great to watch just for the scenery, costumes,carved physiques, and visual action. One has to get over listening to the ""latin like"" talk, but then it becomes a element that makes it feel more like a bygone time."
3,"Good read, but lots of errors...","If you have some electronics experience and basic hand tools, this is a good source of robot building information. Most of the material deals with building robots to mimic living creatures such as insects, using both discrete circuits and microprocessors.I received alot of insight into building this type of robot, but was disappointed by the abundance of typos and errors in the circuit diagrams. Looks like they got in a bit of a hurry to get it to press."
3,Good intro for the novice- just a teaser for others,"This book covers a LOT of topics, which makes it a good intro for the novice. For those who have built basic robots, or with similar experience, it's kind of a teaser - there are several pictures of interesting robots with no explanation of how they work or what they do. There are buzzwords like 'neural nets' but no real applications beyond simple light-searching logic. Still, I think this book is a great value, because of its low price and wide span of topics. It's got just enough detail to get a high-school student to build his first 'bot, and includes good pictures and illustrations. I recommend it as a gift to any inquisitive, creative mind."
4,helpful book,"This book has great pictures. It is not as comprehensive as I would have liked, but is still a very helpful guide to 60's fashion."
4,An Underated Confederate General,"Braxton Bragg doesn't have the good press that Lee, Jackson, or Forrest had, but he was one of the Confederacy's better generals. This biography covers his life through the end of 1862, and it illustrates much about how the Confederate Armies went wrong.Bragg again and again planned good actions against the Union forces, only to see them fall apart as his subordinates just ignored his orders. Particularly bad was Leonidas Polk, who was a bad enough general to singlehandedly doom the Confederacy, but there were other offenders.A military genius might have overcome this. Bragg was merely above average for a Confederate commander, and thus he never had a chance.Very interesting, and the maps are outstanding, among the best I've ever seen in a history.Read it to see how a bad culture can foul up a good army with a good commander."
2,jimmy's poems,"while the poems are not horrible, there really isn't much that is spectacular about carter's poems. they are regional poems told in a simple voice, you can almost hear carter's voice. still, i think he needs more time to work on his poetic skill. the illustrations were nice, i think that carter's granddaughter has a future in illustrating children's books."
3,Not too bad!,"This wasn't one of the greatest Stone Barrington novels, but it was still entertaining albeit it all takes place in Great Britain. Almost swindled, but he still makes out in the end. Would make a great movie. I wish Arrington would get her act together, but then I've rarely found men who can write women characters with the depth, compassion and decency of most women. Stone doesn't seem to be a whoring with as many women in this one, what a change that is! Worth the read!"
3,Welcome Back Stone,"I waited patiently for the next Stone Barrington book to arrive! This one was read in one day because of the easy writing style of Mr. Woods. Stone takes an unusual case from a man that sends Stone to England to retrieve the gentlemans neice. Stone soon discovers that the girl he is sent to find is not the gentleman's neice and that begins a journey into governmental spies and smuggling and illegal trading activities, along with the occaisional murders. The best part is that Stone is briefly reunited with Arrington and he also hooks up again with Sarah the artist. Dino comes to Stone's rescue (as usual) and helps Stone through some pretty scary situations. I didn't think it was one of the best Stone books, but if you enjoy the Stone Barringotn series, you will enjoy this book."
5,Wonderful!,"This was the first piece of Viking cookware I purchased and I have never ever regretted spending the money! It cooks evenly without hot spots. And I use it all of the time. Viking is the best stainless cookware I have ever used, and I have All-Clad, too. This is better! The handle makes it really easy to grip and lift. This pan is well worth the money."
1,WARNING REGARDING SHINING STARS FROG,"I was given a Shining Stars Frog, and thought it would be wonderful to name a star after my son, who is in Heaven. However, when I went to the website ""[...]"" to choose a star and give it my son's name, all I got was a screen stating that Russ Berrie had filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, and the website was no longer available. I cannot imagine the disappointment of children who are given this adorable frog, thinking they can name a star after themselves. As for myself, I couldn't be more disappointed - I had pictured myself looking up at the stars at night, knowing that one of them had my son's name."
1,Not as advertised - Big disappointment,"The draw for this toy is the ability to ""name"" a star with the International Star registry. I bought several as gifts and one for my son. The Russ Berrie, Inc company is currently in bankruptcy so the Shiningstars.com web site is not functioning. The plush is cute, but so disappointed that there is no way to register star name."
4,Mysterious Search for Truth,"Having stepped away from this novel for more than a few days now, I can say honestly that its themes and characters become stronger with a little thought. Peter Dexter is a good (sometimes great) writer, and the story moves along well. The book centers on the death of a local sheriff and a native son who comes back as a newspaper man to investigate the murder along with his hotshot partner. The story is as much about family mysteries and lies as the case to be investigated.More than that, the story is about truth and ""truthiness."" These are the themes that stick with you long after the reading is done.I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because there are some unresolved characters and issues in the book, which doesn't make it a completely satisfying read. Still, the story that Dexter presents in ""The Paperboy"" is worth pursuing to anyone who loves good writing."
3,"Somewhat Pointless, Regrettably","I listened to the audio version of this book, as it is read by the great Frank Muller. While Dexter is a fine writer and skilled at character development, the characters he has created in ""The Paperboy"" are almost uniformly ineffectual and irritating. A central character, a reporter named Ward James, is depicted as passive almost to the point of catatonia. If any explanation is offered for this affect, I missed it. Although great effort is expended by Ward to meet with various members of a murderous backwoods family implicated in the death of a local sheriff, the purpose served by such meetings is nearly indiscernable. On the other hand, if you enjoy endless descriptions of people drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, this book is recommended. All in all, a frustrating experience."
1,"small, overpriced","cute doll but it is really TINY. For 9 inches, that is the longest part of the toy which includes about 2"" of sprouted hair on boots.It is really not any bigger than a beanie baby."
4,It's good for a small gift,"I got this for my little cousin who is obsessed with Dora. She loves it! It's small and cute, nothing to lose you head over. But it really is a nice little present for them to hold on to. I'm glad I got it. It seems durable which is good because she will be lugging it around with her. And it's soft enough that she can sleep with it."
5,Boots,Was unable to find product in the store and purchased online. Purchased for my Grandson who is 1 1/2 yrs old. He is a great fan of Dora the explorer. There are no small parts that can come off. He was delighted with Boots.
3,Little Boots,"Before I made the purchase of this item I used my ruler to get a feel for the size, but upon it's arrival I was not happy with the size and the very HIGH price tag. But, knowing the love my little cousin has for Boots I could not send it back."
3,Smaller than I thought,"Boots is much smaller than I thought. It does specify that he is 9"". I think for $15 I expected something a bit more than what I got. I pay five dollars for just about every licensed doll in this size so to have him come out of the box so much smaller was a bummer."
4,Cute,This is cute. Its a little smaller than I thought it was but its still cute. Soft. Seems Safe for my 16 month old to tote around.
4,Act like a monkey down the street and to rescue my movie....,sister. I used this for a scene were the little girl had to be in the car in her carseat to pickup her movie sister. The little girl was acting like a monkey in the car.
4,Your Comupter + This Game = An Expensive (and fun) Deck of Cards,If you like solitaire and mahjong this is a decent game for the money. The graphics aren't bad and the variety of games is nice.
4,Beautiful and Soft!,It came in excellent timing and it looks way better in person! My baby isn't due until next month so I placed my 5 month old niece in it and she LOVED it:) Idk how long the pillow will last or if it will get flat quickly and I would like a cover for it but I'm happy with my purchase. It was a great price too i think my baby girl will love it.
4,Very Comfy,"This pillow really helps when breast feeding and provides a lot of support to both me and the baby. The only thing is it slips out of place quite easily. Other than that, it's absolutely great."
2,"Buy a My Brest Friend for breastfeeding, this pillow is better for a napping baby","I bought the original Boppy, My Brest Friend nursing pillow and this pillow. If you want a nursing pillow, get my Brest Friend. It is the best! Has much more support for both you and the baby (you can walk around with it and still nurse) and the cover comes off for washing. Le'Cuddler is good for putting the baby in it to take a nap or when they are tired of the swing or bouncer, but it wasn't a very good nursing pillow for me. I like the Boppy for tummy time for my son, but again not a great nursing pillow. Although it is better at it than Le'Cuddler."
2,you can find it any where,"The information in this book can be found on any google search. I like the over all concept of getting a solar oven to reduce energy use or emergency situations where the grid is down. The book is alright but save the money and google or you tube how to make a solar oven. The recipes looked good, but any slow cooker recipe will work."
1,Not as expected...,"Had to return because silver content could not be verified and James Avery refused to add it to one of their bracelets. Refund was slow, but was at last completed."
1,Maybe I am doing something wrong,I tried two different Manic Panic colors on my daughter (a blue and a pink). Neither had any effect. She has dark brown hair. I do know that since we are only using as a rise the color is not going to be bright (we are not using bleach) but.......... neither color made one bit of difference. I even tried using heat (sat her under a dryer) the second time... still nothing. Am I doing something wrong?
5,Charming and profound,"""The Spiritual Life of Animals and Plants"" is a wonderful exploration of the sensitivity and susceptibility of animals to the spiritual world. It is well written and very engaging. The stories, in and of themselves, are full of charm and subtle humor - and can be read at any level. This is a book that anyone with an appreciation of the animal and natural world will enjoy. The author deftly makes the connections between the physical and spiritual world."
3,"it works, but...","This is more of a lid holder than nifty tool that lets it ""slide aside""The thing is held to the grill by two flat hooks that don't do a good job of holding it flat against the grill. The result is that there is a lot of horizontal play when the lid is sitting in it.Overall, it's better than using the built in lid hook to hang it on the grill handle, but not by a lot."
5,"ATR's ""Fall of Ideals"" is a masterpiece !","A great effort by this underated New England band. Their previous cd, ""This Darkened Heart"", was good. But, ""The Fall of Ideals"", is a few notches better. Honestly, I think these guys are better than both, Killswitch Engage (KSE) and Shadows Fall. Also from the New England region and immensely popular.The guitar work by Oli Hebert & Mike Martin is impeccable. Though similiar to Shadows Fall's axe tandem, Jonathan Donais & Matt Bachand. Hebert & Martin have expanded upon that formula. Frankly they do it better and with more creativity. Vocalist Phil Labonte displays his versatility on this album. Again, doing it better than vocalist Brian Fair of Shadow's Fall.I hope with this album. That metal fans become more aware of this band !"
4,awesome,In this review i am going to sum up 2 cd's they made.this darkened heart- i love this cd. It isn't overly heavy but I really like the amount of time it seems they put into this album. good amount of tracks and just good song writing.only prob probably could have been recorded betterfall of ideals. much heavier which I like. but for some reason something is lacking on this record. i think to much double bass for there style of music i'm not sure. I also don't think they took enough time in writing the songs. anyway still a killer release with good recording.all in all i like this darkened heart better but fall of ideals is still awesome..pick up both albums
1,Terrible,"I wouldn't even give a zero to this book, it is simply the worst book I have used and definitely outdated. Just can't understand why would a college use the old book horrible written. Nothing make sense, the back index is horrible - one cannot find what is needed, the definitions, everything is all over the place... Shouldn't even cost a cent...Horrible"
5,Mozart,"Mozart, lovely, lovely Mozart. One of the better operas, though not the exact version I would have wanted. It is lovely to hear Te Kanawa (my wife spent part of a morning, once, talking with Kiri not knowing whom she was.)Happy to have this as part of my collection, and I'm not an opera buff."
3,Wrong cover for the Weber Summit 450,"I am sure this is a fine cover for its intented use but I am not aware of what grill is was designed to fit. I got ahold of one as a result of Amazon's having recommeded it at the time I purchased my Weber Summit 450. This was an incorrect recommendation for the Summit 450 and the cover did not fit well. Amazon was gracious enough to accept the return of the cover even after I had opened and used it. Back to the cover, you should know, if considering this cover, that it does not extend down to the ground, which is exactly the way the picture shows it. Never liked this about this cover, and the front vent lets in too much moisture when it rains. Maybe all this is simply as a result of it being the wrong product for my needs and in fact it works well where intended."
5,cover,"The cover arrived in 5 days . It fit nicely and is made of good quaslity. it makes my grill look like brand new. I was amazed at how ratty my grill looked before the new cover, but no more."
2,Wrong Cover for S-450,"I should have read a similar review before I purchased this with my new grill, the Summit S-450. Amazon should remove the option of purchasing these items together since this is not the correct grill cover for that model grill."
4,read like a classic team up,"While a Justice League book, the focus of this one is mostly on the team up Batman and Hawkgirl. The rest of the JL is there, playing supporting parts - which works for this story.The interplay between the animated versions of Batman and Hawkgirl are interesting. There is also hinted details to this Hawkgirl's past that we have yet to see much glimpse of on the show. I'd like to read another teaming of these two when Batman is a bit more up to his game (you understand what I mean when you read the book...)."
5,Weber Barbecue Apron,Very good apron...made of high quality material! A must for the king of all summer barbecue grillers!!!
5,Spider-man to the rescue!,This is my only Spider-man playset and the flip is very fast. His web is not too sticky but it's fun to trap enemies in it. He's a super-poseable night shadow Spider-man but on the box they show him on normal suit. well that's it.
2,ok,"I actually bought this item to add $$ to my order to get free shipping - however the needles are hard to catch the yarn as you are trying to crochet. I taught myself to crochet years ago, and currently I am using cotton thread to make dishcloths for Christmas gifts. I will currently bought more boyt needles at Walmart - I really like those,"
2,I didn't like it,"I have used hair dye, I used Raw from Hot Topic. The Raw stayed in my hair for months. When I used this it stayed in my for less than a week. I don't know if it is because of my hair or because this brand isn't good. I really like the color of this though. The color is very pretty."
3,Way Over the Averages Head!,"This book is not for the faint at heart. However, it can be useful for the geek. It definitely is not for the beginner. It is dense and steeped in code lines.If one wants a good beginner book for MySql, PHP and Apache then I recommend Sams Teach Yourself PHP, MySQL and Apache in 24 Hours by Julie C. Meloni (Paperback - Dec. 11, 2002.It is an older book so it may difficult to find at times, but most of the code is Basic knowledge and easy to follow. If one buys a copy make sure it has the CD in it that can be very helpful."
5,Radio,"I put this into a 2000 Ford Ranger. Installation was very easy, and wow does this unit sound awesome! I like all the features. It looks like allot of buttons and could be confusing but it's really not. I would recommend this unit to anyone."
2,good sound for about a year,Sound started out good needs more preamp filters especially for radio feed.then buttons that initiate face plate dropping down for cd player began to act up. Next face plate wont move. Tried manufacture reset but did nothing. Talked to Dual and they had a strict 1 year policy so the unit is trash. going back to less flash and more quality IMO.
2,waste of time,"John Friend is long winded and likes to hear himself talk, There could me a lot lessof his inspirational blah blah blah and more instruction. This DVD is not worth thepurchase price or the time it takes to watch it. It feels like something recorded and putout solely to make money. It's to bad because i really like Anusara Yoga and was lookingforward to this."
1,what good is a computer without a power supply? A power supply is basic. I shouldnt have to purchase one now. Absurd.,what good is a computer without a power supply? A power supply is basic. I shouldnt have to purchase one now. Absurd.
2,It's too small,"This cover is good if you plan on leaving the grill out just for the summer. It fits ok, however I had to struggle to get it over the on/off knob on the left. Also, if you have the stand, forget it. Normally I pack my grill away for the winter, but with gas prices rising, I plan on leaving it out all winter. I bought one of the larger Weber covers and it works great. It's heavy duty and covers the grill, stand and gas tank."
5,i love 16 and pregnant,because its my favorite program. i watch it over and over. i enjoy whats going to happen next love watching the children as they grow
5,A first class first,"A book you could easily pass by if only looking at the front cover and deciding it's not for you.By reading the back cover, you realise that this is not a simple story based on either historic Ireland or Northern Ireland in the recent past. However, until you read the book, you will not appreciate how historic facts and recent events have been expertly blended into two separate, alternating stories.Both plots are informative, exciting and emotive in their own rights.One of the most readable and un-put-down-able books I have read.It appears that this is a firsr from Trevor Summons. I cannot wait for the next one!"
4,Huge help,I have used ALTARS on three separate occasions and found it indespensible! All three times I was at a loss on what I should be seeking and this has come to the rescue. A must have for anyone starting or learing about building their own altars.
4,There is an Altar For You,This book proved to be and excellent resource for someone like me; someone looking for a way to establish a place to meditate. Somewhere I can slow down and contemplate and pray. The book has much information on creating such a space and has beautiful pictures and illustrations to show what others have done for themselves.I highly recommend this book to anyone on a quest to carve out a niche in their lives for spiritual growth.
4,How would artists fight a war?,"After a plague that killed most of the population, San Francisco has become an artists' colony. A young woman goes to San Francisco to find her mother and to warn the residents of the coming invasion. The artists must fight to defend their city, but they'd rather be painting the Golden Gate Bridge blue.This is an entertaining, unusual, and well written post-apocalyptic story that gives new meaning to the phrase ""the art of war."" It includes magical elements that I could've done without, but all in all, I really enjoyed it."
1,Weber Cover Shrinkage,"Purchased Weber grill cover 2 1/2 years ago to replace a an original weber cover lost during a thunderstorm. It will no longer fits my grill. Customer service says we should keep the grill out of the sun. I have had the weber grill for eight years and the first cover lasted over five years and always fit as if it were new. The repalcement (same part number) is unusable. STAY AWAY FROM WEBER COVERS. I have always had a weber grill, but this may be the last one."
4,"Good, but not great","The Epitome of Hyperbole is the 5th Brian Regan skit I've seen/listened to, and I have to say this is a step down from his previous work. I watched this probably about 2 weeks ago, and haven't watched it since then. I actually can't remember any bits from it. There is an encore he does after the regular session, during which he does his funniest two jokes. The down side is that both jokes were from previous bits. Maybe I just had too high of expectations of it. Gotta still love the guy though."
5,Hilarious!,Really enjoy this comedian! He really makes you laugh out loud. Would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a good laugh.
3,not bad...,"Hazel was a guitar-driven band that wrote some pretty good songs but failed to strike enough of an impact to make me want to devote myself to their brand of upbeat grungy rock. this cd is a pretty good enough listen, overall. i like some of the melodies but i find myself bored. Hazel reminds me of bands like Pond, Heatmiser, and Crackerbash...but with a much thinner sound and less creativity. this is a great album cover, though!"
3,Charger only for stick battery not Pod or Stick,Charger recieved was not the one I ordered but it worked and I needed it RIGHT NOW ! May need to take it up with Amazon later.
5,Great timbale sticks,"These timbale sticks have the right size and weight for getting the best sound from my timbale, and at the same time to feel comfortable. The delivery was fine, also."
2,doesn't glow in the dark,"this belly ring is supposed to glow in the dark but doesn't.I held it upto a light source (about 1 inch from the bulb itself) for about 10 minutes and then went to the dark room and even used my hands to make sure it is in complete darkness and still no glow.UPDATE: i ordered another glow-in-the-dark belly ring, held both in the sunlight and went in my closet. The other one was already glowing before I was even in complete darkness and this red twister didn't glow at all. This proves it wasn't just me or the light source and the red twister just isn't the glow in the dark type."
5,Great device,"Item was as stated, works perfectly to aid in getting in and out of the car. Gives you a spot that is needed to hold on to something."
5,If you need help standing up from the car this is perfect!,"I've had one of these for years. Ever since I was in a critical car accident and now in a wheelchair, this little handle helps me lift myself out of the car seat and I can stand (momentarily) to get into my wheelchair. For low-profile cars, this is a must.I gave this one to a dear, older friend who could no longer stand up from the car seat without assistance. Now she can get out of the car without assistance from another person. She is so happy to have some 'independence' back in her life."
5,My 3 year old's favorite book,"The compelling and beautifully illustrated story of the poor Wumps whose world is taken over by polluting aliens with fascinating space ships and machines has been among my son's favorite books (most requested reads)since he was 3yrs old. In my son's opinion, this is Bill Peet's best book."
1,Spotty Material Coverage,Very spotty coverage on a couple of key areas including systems modelling/simulation. This area should have been covered with more depth as it is a basis for later chapters. This text is probably better suited to advanced engineers and only as a reference.
1,What is this all about?! It's weak!,"I can't believe Michael Schenker agreed with the realease of this piece of sh...t! Man, this live set had everything to be remarkable: the set list is stunning, the band is tight, the sound is good (Michael's guitar is sounding crisp and right at the spot in all songs).So, what's wrong? Just a ""little"" detail: there is only one single camera shooting the whole concert! yes, that's right: one camera positioned at the final row of the audience, using zoom to focus in the musicians once in a while! THis makes the experience of watching the whole show really annoying, it's unbeliavable someone released a live DVD like this! Buy at your own risk."
2,"Lousy footage, great Bonus interview",This DVD is comprised of footage from a single camera and was not shot for release. The sound is not horrible but there is really not much to watch since the camera is mostly distant and the quality is just raw and substandard. I give the item 2 stars because the Bonus material includes an interview with Michael Schenker that is a great glimpse into a rather reclusive and reluctant guitar god's history. I would highly recommend that you rent or borrow this item and I am a slobering UFO/MSG fan but this DVD has nothing to offer and is really an officially released bootleg.
1,Crappy Pen,"This is the crappiest pen in existence. BIC pens are of better quality. I bought this pen to serve as the pen to sign the paper work to my first home. In the course of 2 months, the pen literally fell apart. Needless to say I was not able to use the pen for its intended purpose.In conclusion, this is not an instument of fine writing. If that is what you desire, you should bite the bullet and spend some dollars on a quality pen."
3,Good but not the best,"I agree with several of the other folks here that Tyson is much to strict on ritual and cerimony. This was my first book as an introduction to runes and it was a wonderful learning tool. The best parts of this book are his poetry references, the alphabet, meanings, and as a good building point to base your own rituals and practices off of."
1,Seriously dissapointing,"This is quite positively the worst shark doc i've ever seen. It failed to achieve anything, there were no new scientific discoveries, too much talk and not enough footage of the sharks themselves. It wasn't even very educational. The two presenters (including the much respected Rodney Fox) are almost comical and are more like pensioners on a day at the sea side than shark experts. Coming from IMAX i would also have expected the sound to be more impressive but my rear speakers hardly made a sound. This may have seemed more spectacular on the IMAX cinema but on your regular set up it isn't worth a look in."
2,Not like anusara studio classes,"There is way too much talking in this video and not enough yoga. I do not recommend this DVD to anyone. It doesn't even guide you through enough exercises. I love Anusara classes in person, but not on video."
1,Basic factual errors...,"Like one of the other reviewers, I had a lot of trouble getting past the lack of basic research done by the author. I realize that NSA (not ""the NSA"") is in the news these days, but couldn't she at least have read a book or done enough research to realize that it was the wrong government agency to use for this story line? It could have been a good book with just some minimal attention to detail."
3,"Good Story, Needs Serious Editing","The plot of this book was good and the pacing kept things interesting. Unfortunately, whoever edited it should be fired...immediately. There are basic grammatical mistakes (militaries vs military's, for example), research errors (it's CODIS, not CODUS), melodramatic and clichéd descriptions that should have been edited out, and dialogue that should have been made a bit more realistic.If you can get beyond all that, however, Perfect Weapon is a fun read."
1,tremendously disappointing,I'm unfamiliar with some of the other bands mentioned but to compare Eric Matthews to Elvis Costello is just silly. Matthews has a poor voice and really has nothing to say on any of these songs. The pompous review on the liner notes that all other music is irrelevant now that Eric Matthews has come along really annoyed me. I just found this album boring-good thing i paid [$$] for it.
5,Fabulous Performance,"I didn't know much about Mitsuko apart from her reputaion. And that reputation is well deserved and not over hyped. This is a cracking recording and one that will persuade me to collect more of her. It may be a flippant piece, bur the Rondo is worth the price of the disc. Most enjoyable and highly recommended."
2,Boring,This seemed more of a documentary than anything else. Wasn't funny and pretty disappointing. Rent if curious but don't buy!
1,I feel unamused,"I cant understand why this guy gets positive reviews, its low level comedy. Sophomoric quality puns...Pathetic! Ive lost time off my life AGAIn for giving a 2nd chance!!"
5,Funniest Dude!,"Kevin Hart is hilarious! All of his Stand-Up specials are funny, but this one is my favorite. His story about his dad is the best!! haha"
3,Not new material,I really like Kevin Hart but I was disappointed that this was not new material. I've heard most of these jokes before but I'm trying to figure how because I didn't go to see this live. Maybe this taping was on Comedy Central and I forgot.
3,funny but not rated,"This was purchased as a gift and no warning was issued when I found it on this site. The begining of the dvd is very funny but halfway through it becomes pretty vulgar and not appropriate for teens, which is unfortunatley who it was bought for."
5,A cookbook to read and to cook from,"Love it. More for the information from Alan Simms(sp?) on how the ""real"" food is made for camera shots, but also because the receipes are for interesting food and drink, like mead, etc."
2,Olympus DS-330 Digital Voice Recorder - UPGRADE warning,"I've owned this product for a fair while now, and had nothing but good things to say about it, UNTIL I upgraded my PC to Vista.I discovered that the software CD provided with the unit doesn't work effectively on Vista, and when I contacted Olympus, via olympusvoice.com.au I was told the following:""The version of software you are using is not Vista compatible. We can supply you with the release 7 version for $94 including gst.""Now given that I already own the software for a previous release, and that the price quoted is at least 1/3rd of what I paid for the unit to begin with, I'd suggest it's a bad deal.If anyone is looking at this unit, suggest you check first that the software is compatible with your machine. If you're looking at upgrading your machine, BEWARE you don't fall into the same trap that I did - obviously I feel that Olympus' customer service leaves a lot to be desired."
4,"DS-330, Small but Powerful","I purchased the DS-330 for the purpose of recording meetings of my Association. Usually 8-12 persons attend the meetings and are seated around a large conference table. I haven't yet been able to use the recorder at an actual meeting, but I have simulated the same conditions,testing the recorder, and found it quite suitable for the task. I learned to operate the DS-330 by trial and error rather than resorting to the Instruction Manual that accompanies the recorder. The Manual does contain the basics but the Manual Index does not help very much in finding the desired reference. The DS-330 is a fine recorder; its supporting documentation needs elaboration and improvement in the construction of the Index."
5,"Jessye Norman, most magnificent","This recording of Jessye Norman makes the hair on the back of ones neck stand up. When hearing her sing, without accompaniment, the Traditional songs on this disc one can fully understand why she received a 58 minute ovation in Vienna. A spellbinding C.D."
5,Amazing isn't strong enough,"As a long time RPG'er, I was a little skeptical of World Tree and the whole anthro thing in general. Thank goodness I had a couple hours I needed to kill at a con. I was sucked into the setting, a very vivid, alive one. The people, the places! This isn't some quasi-medival clone game. The World Tree setting is refreshingly unique and original. If you enjoy role-playing - or are just looking for a really good read involving history, politics and an alien world - buy this book!"
2,Headache,"This world is one that actually feels alive. There are three real problems:1. A+B=Result This is a nice idea if there weren't 30+ skills and 13 abilities, leaving way too many possibilities; enough to make my head hurt.2. Creating anything takes hours. Even after getting the system under my belt, an undertaking like nobody's business, it still takes at least an hour to make something cold cut and generic. Something unique and dynamic can take anywhere from twelve to thirty-six hours.3. Getting players is unimaginable for World Tree. One look at the system can make most reasonable people want to tear their eyes out.On the upside the world IS a very alive thing."
5,Kit's Surprise,Kit's Surprise is my favorite American Girl Book! The setting is nineteen thirty four in Cincinatti. Kit's dad has lost his job and her family is struggling to have enough money to pay their bills. Kit is highly discouraged because she is asked to care for her nasty uncle. He always has a list of jobs ready for Kit. She becomes even more sad because she and her best friend Ruthie get into a huge fight. Can Kit find a way to brighten up the holidays? Read this book to find out!
3,Not too bad,"After being a Stone Roses fan for years, I think the Bluetones can cut it. I'm not saying they are the great Manchester band, but many of the songs are great. I enjoy this album and suggest buying it if you like the Roses, Charlatans, or Primal Scream."
5,Excellent!,I ordered this music after watching the series. The music is full of variety and beauty. It has pathos and humor and richness...and a touch of quirkiness. A great addition to your music library!
4,Fairfield Four,"I first heard the CD in a local audio sound room, on a B&W 802D amplified by McIntosh gear. Tract #2 ""These Bones"" is worth it, and tract #1 isn't far behind. The male bass voice came out so palpable from and in front of the RIGHT channel, accompanied by other background vocals coming from CENTER stage and LEFT channel."
3,Not Wilson's Best Stuff,"The medical thriller turns out to be a story with an easy to follow plot, predictable twists and turns, but still is light and enjoyable reading. I wasn’t disappointed reading through this, but I suspect Wilson offers better stuff. Wilsons style is direct and unhurried, a delight to read. The characters are real enough, but not amazing. The pacing is steadily climbing uphill, and I found no fault there. Not much suspense was built throughout, and the villain and 'secrets' were all known upfront to the reader before the protagonist had it figured out. I didn't enjoy the relationship between Gina and Gerry much - it came across as contrived and much too predictable. The story isn’tunpredictable by any means, but it’s still a fun little thriller."
2,"Okay, I Guess","It's just that F. Paul Wilson has written much better books. This was a paint-by-numbers, standard medical thriller, in which you can pretty much predict which doctor is going to turn out to be evil, who is going to be killed by him, what's going to happen to the hero/heroine way before it happens. Also, people make incredibly stupid decisions, so dumb that you almost don't care what happens to them. Dissapointing, especially for F/ Paul Wilson--I know he can do better than this."
2,Obscure words do not a villain make,"I agree with most of the negative reviews of this book. It was a fairly lame combination of politics and suspense. I found the author's game of chosing obscure words to be excessive, extremely annoying, and adding nothing to characterization, except to prove how to use a thesaurus."
3,"Product OK, wish I had bought through a reputable dealer","I purchased two sets of this dinnerwear to have in time for Christmas. The product itself was what I wanted. Unfortunately, they did not have the same warranty on the mugs as they do with the plates. I understand now, because one mug had a samll chip on it and some of the mugs have paint coming off at the rim. The rest of set is in perfect condition. If I had purchased this at a store in town, I could easily return right away. Also, the packaging was very strange when it was shipped. They came in card board boxes, so it makes me think I received seconds (it didn't say seconds on the package though). I'm a little disappointed, but I like the design so much I will keep them."
4,Corelle Watercolor,I bought Corelle because it's lighter than my old stoneware which were hard to pick up. I've had Corelle in the past but these seem different. They almost feel like plastic dishes and I had alays thought Corelle felt almost like china. I love the colors and designs on them espceially compared to other Corelle which tends to only have a very narrow band of color around the border.
5,one of the best albums...ever.,"this album is one of few records that just blew my mind. Took some time though. I admit that I had to listen to it several times to understand the perfection of it. I think that this cd is much better than ""diary"" and ""how it feels to be..."", i really do. Even though both ""diary"" and ""how it feels to be..."" have some of the most amazing songs ever written, ""lp2"" has 9 of them! (every single one) Jeremy Enigk is my hero, and i can't wait for a follow-up to ""return of the frog queen"""
3,"Work well, but not long-lasting","These certainly work well in myOlympus D-580 4MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom, and last a lot longer than alkaline batteries, but I only got about 300 images, and a few short (3 minute) movies out of one battery. And if I did a lot of optical zooming, the camera would slow down for a bit until it rested. When the first battery in the 2 pack died, I put in a new one. I've taken around 30 photos on the new battery, and then I checked the voltage on it compared to the one I hadn't used yet: 2.928 volts for the ""dead"" one, and 2.967 on the new one. Pretty close!I just got the2 NEW Lithium-Ion BATTERY & CHARGER For KODAK CR-V3 CRV3 C743 / DX4530 / DX6330 / DX6340set and couldn't be more pleased; 2 rechargeable batteries and charger, and for about the same price as this 2 pack!"
3,Incomplete handbook,"Really figured that being a 'student's handbook' it would have had photographs of mushrooms; however, it had absolutely none, which was a huge disappointment, thus making this not a good choice to even attempt to identify a mushroom."
1,Definitely not worth the little money,"This is the second review I have written for this product. The first one mysteriously disappeared. I'm taking a screen shot of this page for future reference, though.I purchased this as an adjunct for my law practice. What a waste.What the reviews don't tell you is that all FOUR CDs contain a total of about 70 MB of substantive material (there are demos that increase the size on some disks). The ""Forms"" CD has less than 5 MB. You don't get nearly as much as you think you are getting.Also, the copyrights on several of these programs are from 1996!The programs themselves are poorly laid out and contain only cursory information on many topics. If you are looking to avoid hiring a lawyer by purchasing this package, forget it. You may get a general idea of the things required for legal transactions, but I wouldn't bet the farm on these forms.Bottom line is that you get what you pay for - even if you only pay [$$$]. Look for something else."
5,Great buy!!,"I got a great deal!!! (Full price definitely not worth the money, but at this price I am quite pleased.) The quality is really not up to regular DJP standards even at %70 off it is close but these are really cute on and surprisingly flaterring for a flat boot; this comming from a person who almost always wears a 3-4 inch heel. Very hot boots, but dont pay full price because the quality is not there. The fit is great as always with DJP."
5,Participating in history,"Covering Castastrophe is a book that ought to be in everyone's library. It is an historic record of a horrific event in our history. It gave me the feeling of participating in history that eventful day. Frequently, I had to stop reading it because I felt I was walking beside every reporter, correspondent, producer, anchorman and camerman. There were times I could not breathe either. As a former New Yorker, who watched the towers being built, I was mesmerized and glued to the TV, as everyone else. Visiting Ground Zero was emotional. This book left an impact that has overwhelmed me. It has given me a better understanding of how determined these people work to get the story and get it right. What a great job they do. Another group of unsung heroes. Well done, all!!"
5,Covering catastrohe,This book is very well done. The excerpts from the Journalists of September 11 are not only factual but from the heart. It is sometimes hard to read very much at a time since it so emotional. I am proud that this event was so well documented by the men and women who present us with news.
1,This is NOT a fun game,"I'm sorry, but this is the least challenging, most boring game! One of my favorite games is ""Taboo"" but if you play it enough, it gets so you can remember the cards you are guessing (somewhat). My idea of fun games: BOGGLE, SCRABBLE. If you want a game for all ages: give each person an educational book and ask each person to write down 5 questions (they also have to mark the book and page or remember the answers). Each person asks their questions, the others write down their answers. Then each person gives their correct answers and you see who got the most right. It is educational and fun! (Kind of like: Are you smarter than a 5th grader)!!!"
5,Buy this!,"This is the best game in the history of the world! It is great fun for kids and adults alike. The way you play is that one person is the judge, and the other people are the players. The judge deals a green card with an adjective on it. The other players put one of five of their red cards down the judge then decides which card best fits the adjective. The winner gets the grren card. Some times it can be hilarious. The first to five cards wins! Don't go one more day without Apples to Apples!"
2,coming of age in california,"The book was listed as like new condition but when I got it, it had alot of writing in pen, in the 1st few chapters."
1,Not worth it!,"I agree with the other reviewer. What a waste! If you're looking to see Shelties at varies stages of life, or various colorings, etc. look elsewhere. This was the only DVD that I could find on Shetland Sheepdogs, and I wish I'd passed on it. But I wanted to show the family what we're considering. I watched it by myself, and I'm glad I did. The kids would have been bored stiff, and they used ONE puppy throughout the entire video. Talk about boring. I wanted to see litters of puppies playing together, adult dogs doing tricks. Pass on this, buy a good & informative book filled with pictures, and then find homemade videos of real people with their dogs. Much more satisfying."
4,Be forewarned!,"This was a very good movie, however the reviews here are extremely misleading! This is not a Heath Ledger film, he shows up for maybe five minutes. I think it is more important however to let people know that this movie deals with very serious issues...it is not a piece of fluff. For those who are squirmish be forewarned, there is a scene of a gang rape that is very disturbing."
4,Black rock,"I think the movie was a bit to graphical for younger people to be viewing. But on the other it is good for people that are in senor grade in small country towens that dont have access to larg citys as this gives them an insit of what can happen to people and happens every day. I think it is a grate educationl movie as it opens peoples eyes to the fact that crimes do go on where people see and dont tell any one, and how it tars them apart. It also shows that things like rap and muder can happen like that in small towens."
5,Heath is a God!,"How can I describe in a maximum of 1,000 words what has taken me a lifetime to understand? My love for Heath is unable to be measured on any scale known to man. He is my world, my true meaning for existing. His beauty makes me want to cry, to surrender my heart. He does things to me that no other has ever done before. I feel as if I am in comlete nirvana when I see his face. If only I could touch his...face...AHHH WHAT A MAN HE IS! And the movie was nice, too."
4,Not very user friendly,"I bought this player to primarily record class lectures. Not a good idea. The user interface is not very user friendly. It is a good product though. Works.. fits in the palm of my hand. Very light.Definitely not meant to record anything other than ""notes to self""Note to self: Buy a voice recorder next time! :)"
4,2 Problems....,"This is my first mp3 player. I bought it based on these reviews (thanks everyone).Considering its my first, I found it fairly easy to set up and play music. I just use the MS mediaplayer to rip cd's and sync them to the sansa. No problem there. The sound quality is pretty good, especially after I changed the equalizer setting from ""custom"" to ""rock"".My two gripes are these;1) I cannot shut off the replay option. If I pause a song, it will replay once it reaches the end. I have to manually skip to the next song. If I don't pause a song, it will continue to the next.*Note*The replay option under settings IS turned off!!! Anyone else have this trouble?2) San Disk neglected to include a manual and setup cd. Very annoying. But their customer support directed me to the manual online which I downloaded and printed. Just an annoyance."
2,NOT ENOUGH MUSIC STORAGE!!,"This was my first player. I have had it for ant least six months now. There is one huge problem, NOT ENOUGH STORAGE!!It only took about two months to fill it up full of songs! Other than that it is a convient small player. But still i prefer you get an ipod or something other than this unless you dont need many songs on your player than get this."
1,chrismas gifts!,Hei don't buy anything in herethey never delivered my kids chrismas presents!very bad!!
1,NOT GOOD!!!,I bought this in december of '06. It was working fine until a couple of months after and now it won't even turn on. It shuts off completely and freezes. Don't like it.
1,Stay away from this item,"Does anybody know the steps in order to take advantage of the 1 year warranty. I've had my player for a few months and it turns on fine, but it gets stuck on the screen with the sansa logo and I can't get into my music files and I have to remove the battery in order to turn the player off. Please let me know if anybody actually returned their player for a new one or their money back."
1,Piece of junk,"Got 2 of these less than a month ago. Had given one to my friend and guess what, the one I have works so far and the one my friend has stopped. It worked well for some time. She uses it primarily for the FM radio. Did not copy any files and now it started giving an error ""Not enough space for music DB. Please free 8MB"". It does this when powered up and does not let her go to the menu to select FM radio. Piece of junk would have rates it -5 stars if had the option."
2,Not Happy,"I purchased two for my kids for Christmas, and one stoped working 3 days after Christmas. Sandisk told me to try this and that. After 3 weeks and 4 E-mails, it still dose not work. Good Christmas present! I think NOT. The last contact I had with them, I was told that I could send it to them, that they would look at it, but they needed more Info first. I have not received anything from them as to what to do with it yet!"
5,GREAT gift for a music lover!,"This is the fourth SanDisk MP3 player to enter this household, and it's not because the other ones have bit the dust. Quite the contrary! These are great little devices that have awesome sound, hold a great amount of music, and really withstand the test of time.This was a gift for a family member who has a ton of music on her computer. She can now listen to music while doing dishes, working out, doing whatever. It was a great gift, VERY affordable, and just, well, I'm sure, once again withstand the test of time and has already gotten a LOT of use. A great product for the $!"
1,Worthless,"Don't waste your money or time!! Mine has been used very little, it eats up batteries really fast and now hangs up."
1,don't buy it,"if it functioned, it would be a great player, but it simply is not worth the trouble. seriously, the hours i have spent with this thing have not been worth the bargain. i would rather spend money on something that actually functions, as advertised. it is cheap in every sense of the word, including quality and ""ease of use."" use me as a sad example: save yourselves; do not buy this product. it should be recalled, and sansa sucks even more for not giving us that. we are poor, victimized consumers."
1,Zero stars...,"Please, if you purchase this mp3 player, use it for more than three months before you write a review. You will love it at first, but then...I loved this mp3 player when I got it. It was simple to add files, and the sound was great. However, after three months it gave me the error ""Not enough space for music DB."" The mp3 player was not close to being full. After reading the solutions from Sansa and trying to implement them, I am still left with the error reading. (The only thing I haven't tried is formatting with a Mac. I know no one with a Mac...)I really loved this thing, but it turned out to be such a disappointment."
4,Great MP3 Player for Little $$$,"I've been using this device for about a month. Why spend big bucks on an iPod when $75 gets you all the music you need? Plenty of battery life, easy set up, drag music files off/on with Windows Explorer.I had an email question for their support desk; they got back to me with a good answer in less than 24 hours and provided a name/phone number if I needed follow on help. The website FAQs are weak and if more comprehensive could have resolved my question.I would buy another."
2,work ok but with some bugs,"I got this player from Wal-Mart for about $72 after tax. I like the long battery live, I didn't have to change the battery after 3 or 4 days of usage.The only bug I hate is when I transfer audio tracks from my PC to the player, it changed some title and artist's name for few tracks (each transfer is on few different tracks). Since you can't make any changes when the sound tracks is on the player, nor can you set a ""playlist"" on the player, so when I transfer an audio book to the player, it is not playing in the order of the chapters for the book. Because of this bug, I have to double check the title name every time after a transfer and write down the tracks that the name has been changed and later on manually play the tracks in the order of the eAudio book.I assume people use this player for individual soundtrack doesn't care about this, but for me and people who use it for playing eAudio book will hate this player."
4,SanDisk Sansa 1GB MP3 player,"The software provided with the unit worked well, I bought another mp3 player from another manufacturer that locked up the computer. The menus are easy to use, and it has a nice feature where you can pause the music and the Sansa MP3 player will automatically shut off if you don't hit the play button again. My only complaint is the unit eats a lot of batteries- it is best to go with rechargables. I get about 6 hrs playback time per battery."
3,Ho hum,"Okay, I should have bought the mp3 player my son had with the spot for a memory card so I could hold more music. The sound quality is decent, but the headphones are pretty cheap. Also, it doesn't respond well to cold temperatures. Ever since I went running with it in cold weather, it acts a bit funky, and the lcd menus are faint. Otherwise, good battery life, a worthwhile product for the money. In this day and age, though, we are greedy and want to hold more songs . . . more."
1,"Bought 3 times, Defective 3 times","I bought 1, it was defective - before the first battery was used up problem arose - after playing for about 45 minutes the lock mechanism would activate no matter where the switch was, removing battery and putting back in would not get it working, it would die and usually work again after the next morning.Amazon was kind enough to let me return it. Since the price was so great I decided to give the item another shot. Got another one and the same thing happened. Died before first battery with lock pproblem. Amazon let me return it again. I decided to go for the 2GB model, since the price can't be beat and figuring maybe that will have a better design. The 2gb model has just died before the first battery and it is DEAD DEAD. It will not come on again at all. (tried 3 new batteries). Amazon is letting me return it and I've just ordered something from a different manufacturer. It cost a lot more but it looks like you get what you pay for.:("
1,Don't Purchase!!,"I just purchased 3 of these for my family. The unit is constantly showing ""Unknown"" for artist and album. I'm a software engineer so I live this stuff. I wrote MP3 tags in ID3v2.3, ID3v1 and APEv2. I updated the player using the file explorer and windows media player. Nothing worked. I finally called technical support and they suggested I had 3 faulty units!! If I got 3 what is the chance that you're about to buy a faulty one!"
2,I Guess It's Okay BUT,"I thought I'd be able to download mp3s onto the player from any computer. I received my player in the mail at work and was so excited getting it that I transferred some of the music I already had on my work computer onto the player. Then I went home wanting to transfer more but was unable to do so. Windows Explorer couldn't see the mp3s that I had previously downloaded onto the player. I could only download music whenever I was at work. Then managing the library was another problem. I had a folder for every album and I downloaded the folders onto the player yet the songs were all mixed up.So I bought an 8GB Creative Zen which is much easier to work with. Also, I found that 1GB was not enough space to hold what I had. I'd give the Sansa away but even with the startup CD I don't think the new owner would be able to delete the songs I have on it since I can only get the library to come out on my work computer.2 stars for ease of navigation and having an FM radio."
4,mp3,"I purchased this product for a very reasonable price and very pleased once I received it. It was easy to download songs to. Once I looked at the manual I was able to easily scroll through and change from FM radio to downloaded somgs with ease. It does not have a clip though, which was disappointing."
1,Freezes,Same issue as above. This unit is seriously defective. DO NOT BUY. This is not Amazon this is a product that is has a major glitch.You have been warned!!!
2,Not sure how to rate it,"We went through 3 of these in about 4 weeks. I initially purchased two, one for myself & one for my daughter's Christmas present. They both worked to begin with. I thought the menus were very easy to navigate. I've never used an mp3 player before so I did have to use the manual to figure out how to play albums & such but it was so easy to do once I knew I could. My daughter's died first after about 10 days so we exchanged it. Within a few days, mine had frozen up and died as well so we just flat out returned that one. My daughter's replacement died within a week and was returned as well. I really liked the product when it worked but I think 3 tries is enough. Amazon's exchanging & returning system was very user friendly which was great."
4,"Decent player, interface could use a little work","If you're looking for decent player that won't break the bank, this could be the one. It works fairly well. Overall I would recommend this for a workout kind of MP3 player that you don't have to be too careful with. I bought this in addition to my iPod so I would have a player that I could toss around and not have to care too much if it broke. Not recommended for podcasts - if you change songs or do a sync, it will not remember where you left off and the fast forward is VERY slow. Also, titles with long names need to be scrolled across the screen before you can see the end of the title and the scrolling is way too slow. I would recommend picking up some NiMH rechargeable AAA batteries."
1,Worst product in the world,I recently purchased the M240 at Office Depot. It was on sale and I thought it would be a great deal. Boy was I wrong. In the last week and a half I've gone thru 2 of them. With both of them they would work fine for a day or two and then when I turned them on they would freeze on the start up screen. I contact SanDisk after the first one acted up and they told me to return it to the place of purchase. No big deal I thought. With anything mass produced your bound to get one or two that have problems. So I got another. Now I'm having the same problem. I am never buying an MP3 player from them again. They should stick to SD cards.
1,Garbage!,"I would give this item NEGATIVE stars if possible.What a complete piece of junk. First day I get it andit freezes up. Won't operate at all, can't even turn it offwithout taking the battery out. Spent the good part of two dayson the phone with Sandisk support trying to download ""firmware""to fix the unit. Their support team was beyond pathetic,a total joke. Finally they admitted the unit couldn't be fixed.I asked for a refund, they told me I had to deal directlywith Amazon for that. What a hassle."
1,Buyer beware,"This is a nice, lightweight little player but be careful - SanDisk is not truthful about what support is offered for various formats. I have had serious issues playing back audio files in wma format. I spent many hours with SanDisk tech support resolving possible causes. Initially they blamed the bit rate, but with some work I was able to transfer files with a sampling rate within their spec. Finally, I was told that wma would not play correctly at all (it will skip or not support fast forward or rewind) - it is a 'known issue.' They will not authorize a return or a credit for another model in spite of the fact that they advertise full support for wma. This company is not truthful in the product spec they present, so buy at your own risk!"
5,Amazing product,"Im not going to lie to you, this was a gamble, I did not know what to expect but in the end it was a nice surprise. It holds up to 200 song (depending on the format) and its very easy to operate. Radio is fantastic. Best MP3 player on the market for a very reasonable price. I would buy it as a gift for someone else."
3,SanDisk MP3,It's a good entry level MP3 player. Sound quality is decent. I thnk I'd go the extra mile and by the Nano.
2,the best,I love this player. It's small but plays great. Lots of long playing time and it is very easy to use.
4,SanDisk Sansa M240 1 GB MP3 Player,"bought this for a 9 yr old girl - she loves it! i read that some people have had problems with this device `freezing'. i upgraded the firmware from the scandisk web site and haven't had any problems. good, inexpensive player."
2,Not Well Made,"It holds a lot of music, has a simple interface, and was easy to use while it lasted. It's nice to be able to drag files from the machine to folders on your computer without dealing with the tyranny of Itunes. I treated this unit well (or so I thought) but now it won't start up. It lasted about six months. Pretty disappointing."
2,BIG durability problem,"I bought two of these...one for my wife, and one for me. Mine died after a couple of months. Everything was fine until then. My wife's is still working, but you can't trust this thing to continue to work. Sound quality was good, interface was good, etc. The manual though STINKS and needs to be rewritten. So, anyway, don't buy this one."
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR!,"The player worked as advertised for nearly two weeks, then as with other reviewers, it froze on the start-up screen and would not respond at all! Also regardless of the player having failed I would have hoped to have purchased a better designed player. Overall the modest price is no consolation!*update* I mailed this item back to Amazon on Jan 4 via USPS and Amazon confirmed receiving it on Jan 12. After two emails and one phone call I finally received my refund on Feb 14! I will never purchase from Amazon again!"
3,"FROZE WITHIN THREE MONTHS, SANDISK REPLACING","I bought this as a Christmas gift. The recipient gave it rave reviews, but then it stopped working after three months. First it started freezing, then it would only turn on to the ""Sansa"" screen, then it wouldn't turn on at all. I would have given it a terrible review, but I call SanDisk to give them a chance to make it right and they are shipping me a new one without any hassle. (Even though it sat on my desk for a few months until I got around to calling them.) So, I am back to liking SanDisk again. If this one dies a quick death, I may have to revamp my review, but for now, it's a great choice for someone who wants an inexpensive and portable way to play mp3 files (for example, for audio books)."
4,Good Player for Price,"It is difficult to focus on the product when the service that came with it left much to be desired. On the Amazon.com website it indicated that the SanDisk Sansa M240 comes with case, armband, earphones, 1 AAA battery, CD and user guide. Least to say the user guide, CD and battery were missing. However, Amazon customer service was very prompt in responding to my query. Unfortunately, the player is being used outside of the US, so when my computer failed to recognise it I had to employ a computer expert in my own country to reconfigure the player. Thankfully it now works. Amazon should ensure that what they have stated on the website is what the customer actually gets."
3,It okay...,"Works well but takes battery which is not convenient and needs a clip so you can work out with it. It does not transport well. Otherwise, it holds enough songs for me and its reletively easy to use."
1,Disappointment,"A Christmas present for my electronically-inclined son, but already not working properly. Not very good instructions for trouble-shooting, either."
1,Bad,I originally bought this product had it for 2-3 months then it quit working. I then got a refund and got another one after 8 days it broke! SO DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!
3,middle of the road,"I bought this product about 7 months ago. For the most part I am happy about it, it has not had any problems except I go through batteries like crazy, and it does not hold anywhere near the number of songs it claims to hold. Each time I delete and add more songs it holds less and less...I'm down to it hold a little over 100 songs. I bought this because I was told it would hold over 200 songs, I have NEVER gotten more then 174 songs on this. If this doose break I will probably buy another brand MP3 Player."
1,Waste of money,"It worked well for the first 24 hours..... Worse....I lost all of my 245 songs since the freaking thing stopped working. Don't buy it. Spend your money in a ""real"" mp3 player."
1,Failed to work exactly after one year,I rarely used this. But it failed to work exactly after one year. Do not buy any Sansa MP3 players. They are not reliable.
2,Not worth it...,"This was SUCH a terrible pain in the butt! I had a hard time even getting it to work, then when I did get it to work it only worked for 2 weeks before it called it quits. I cut my losses and bought a 4G Zune - worth every penny."
1,Dont buy it refurbished!,"Ok, i own one of this... and since i am currently on a budget, i decided to buy it refurbished! I feel like the money that i paid for it was a waste! because it will play some songs, but then it will stop, and say that it cannot open a file (which it has played before), and stop playing... Then when i click on the play button, and choose between artist, song, and all that... the only option will be the name of the song that it was about to play when it stopped.... so i have to turn it off, and turn it back on... it happens very often! So... don't buy it refurbished!!!!!!"
2,SanDisk M240 MPS Player,This item was given to a family member as a Christmas gift and in less than a week the screen was frozen and the MP3 player was no longer working.
1,Bad product,This product was good at first but then stopped working soon after... All it will do is turn on and freeze.
5,super easy to use,"I do not know what happens to the other people that bought this, But it was really easy to use!!!!! I loved it only problem, I should have bought the 2gb one. A must buy if just getting your first mp3 player"
4,Excellent value for money,"I purchased this player to use while running, and have also successfully formatted it to use with Ubuntu Linux as an operating system instead of Windows. It is very easy to learn to use and offers excellent sound quality for the money, especially if you want a simple and basic player for everyday use. My only tip for improvement would be that if you want to use the player while exercising, the armband and case that come with it are not adequate (a flimsy clear vinyl pouch with a snap and an armband that chafed pretty badly); spring for the silicone case which has a sturdy clip that you can attach to your shorts or water carrier. Otherwise very pleased!"
3,Too dull to be called glossy...,"The HP Brochure and Flyer Paper is a good product but I would consider this paper to be more semi-glossy than actual glossy paper. It's a cross between matte and glossy. For supposed glossy paper, the finish is a bit dull and doesn't have the luster that my other glossy media has. However, the quality of the paper is pretty good. But just keep in mind that if it's a shimmery or shiny type of paper you're looking for, this isn't it."
2,don't be fooled,"i loved i, swinger...so bought schizophonic with the same expectations---but to no avail. a few of the tunes are interesting---but do not have the same spunk as i, swinger....i would think twice before buying this one......"
3,Mouth too wide--spout too wide and shallow,"I bought a refurbished one that looks new, performs great w/ a quiet motor--yet, the wide mouth on the pitcher, with the wide/shallow spout makes for an unbelievable mess if your liquids are just the slightest bit thick. For me, it is not worth it because of the amount lost in spillage. I am sure it would be fine if the liquid was ""watery"", but not for malts or slushes...sorry."
3,Good but not great,"I bought this book after reading Starless Night and Siege of Darkness beforehand, so I knew some of things that would happen in this book. I found the battle scenes to be somewhat monotonous and all too frequent. I really don't care for ad nauseum descriptions of the sword/weapon techniques used by each character. I do like the book's characters. Drizzt, Entreri and Catti-Brie are very fine characters. However, there really wasn't much of a plot to this book. I would have liked to see more characterization of Vierna and Dinnin and others in the Dark Elf society. Siege of Darkness is the best of the 3 Salvatore books I have read so far. I probably will not read this book again or at least not for a long time."
3,A little too much....,"Well, i like R.A. Salvatore books a lot and i'm not saying i didn't enjoy this one, but honestly, it wasn't really all that great. My only problem is that it was one long fight but different people in it. This seemed to be a one chapter book with many different battles happening all over the underdark. I hope Starless Night is better, but all in all, i did smirk quite a bit while i read this. Mr. Salvatore though really really make his fights detailed and thats a plus at least, too bad that was the majority of the book."
3,more of the same,"In the last book in this series with all the wars wonit looked like the author had painted himself in a corner, but the assassinwas still alive.In this book his back home family of black elfs ( Drow elfs) come lookingfor their defector to the surface.Most of the action takes place in caves under the surface andand there are two important losses of a main character.We are left with a coming Drow invasion for the next episode.This book as usually has a lot of sword plat and fighting in close.I just really didn't enjoy this book much.To me the book offered nothing new in imagination or plot."
4,One of the better series in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting,"Series review: Legacy of the DrawThis series is a 4-part sequel to The Dark Elf Trilogy, which introduced the character of Drizzt Do'Urden, the exiled drow-hero swordmaster (and ranger). In this series, Drizzt undertakes an epic reverse journey back to Menzoberranzan, into the very heart of evil, in order to try to put an end to the hit squads and assassination attempts that threaten him and his friends on the surface.I enjoyed the series very much, but it didn't quite feel up to the same level as the original series. Still, it's a very solid read for those who are fans of The Forgotten Realms Genre, and Role Playing Games in general. There's action and drama aplenty, and plenty of new information on Drow culture for hardcore gaming fans."
5,Great!,Bought this to add to blocks we already have. Great price. Rounded edges - no sharp corners. Arrived quickly. Very pleased.
5,The one toy every kid should have,"Bought 2 of these sets for my two youngest children 1 and 3 for Christmas. They are great. My 8 and 10 year old play with them just as often as my younger two. Just like the blocks found in a school setting, very durable and the wooden box they come in in perfect for building on top of if flipped over or for sitting in if you are little enough. I might even buy another set since 60 blocks is perfect for 1 child but once they start wanting to build towers high enough to touch 9 foot ceilings . . . you need more!"
4,quality set,"I think I like the set more than my kid (although, she does like destroying my creations), pieces are smooth and have rounded edges. Wish the set had a few more pieces, but it has enough to really build some large buildings/things."
5,Great Deal,Blocks of these type are hard to find locally and if you can find them they cost $$$. These are a great price for all you get and the quality of the blocks. Going to buy a second set with all the money saved so we can keep one here for the grandson and one for him to have at his house.He is still a little young for them now but he does have fun knocking them over when we stack them up.
2,Unfinished Wood Makes a Bad Toy,"Within the first three weeks of playing with these blocks, the wood of a few of the pieces began to splinter. Obviously, splintering wood leads to splinters in the kids' hands, so clearly a bad idea. I'm going to have to sand the pieces down and cover in a finish. The blocks that these replaced had been played with for at least 30 years and had just begun to splinter. I wouldn't have purchased these had I known they would be rough and unfinished."
4,Great blocks,"I bought these for my 4 yr old son. He loves them, and they are really made incredibly well. I only wish I bought them when he was 2 or 3. I think they would have been an even bigger hit then! He seems more into Legos than blocks these days..."
5,WE LOVE THESE BLOCKS!,"When I was young, I had a set of solid wood standard unit blocks, and I played with them constantly. Ever since I became a mother, I've looked for a set that was good quality and affordable, and I've finally found them. We absolutely love these blocks. They were a Christmas gift for my 21-month-old son, and he and my 3-year-old play with them every day. They use them to build buildings, castles, and towers for their action figures, and roads for their cars. I didn't notice any smell from the blocks like some reviewers noted, and they don't splinter or split in any way. I would recommend buying more than one set to expand the fun, but one set is definitely enough to play with on it's own. My boys also love the wooden box that the blocks come in - it has been a boat, a chair, and some other very imaginative things. :)"
3,Great Blocks - Tolerances should be better,"I'm comparing this to blocks I had as a kid, similar in size and shape (without the ""safe"" rounded edges of course). They are great and I actually have to sets for my three boys because a single set isn't enough to build any really cool towers. My main complaint is that the blocks don't have good enough tolerances; the blocks are not exactly uniform in size. This isn't a problem for 1-2 foot structures, however, I can use the blocks from my childhood to build a 6 or 7 foot tower, the little size differences in these blocks make something bigger like that virtually impossible. Everything is unstable at about 3 feet."
4,Wood blocks,I bought these blocks for my 2 1/2 yr old great nephew at his mom's request. He seems to like knocking them down as soon as his mom and dad build something. He will soon be able to build things on his own. His mom and dad love them. I think Melissa and Doug are great products for kids.
5,Best Blocks!,These blocks are awesome for all age groups! I even enjoy playing with them! I think they're great for 'family time' and recommend buying two sets.
5,Great fun,"Our two year old loves to get out the blocks and build a barn, a garage, a tower, a tunnel over the train track, whatever the idea is of the day. We can sit and play with these blocks for hours. Very sturdy and high quality, watch the toes when the tower gets knocked down!"
4,"Very fun book, but somewhat lacking in depth","Michael Hanlon has written a book which captures the excitement of getting Galileo to Jupiter. This includes lots of engineering and management fixes to keep things on track, as well as the euphoria when everything finally works, esp. with the atmospheric probe and the Jupiter orbital insertion. He also describes very well the neat science learned while in orbit, esp. the Europa ocean debate.My only problem with the book is that it's kind of at the PR-level of knowledge. That is, if you were following along with the mission, then there's probably not a lot new to learn here. (If you weren't following along, then feel free to disregard this review! :-) There are some interesting new tidbits, like the proposed work on an underground lake in Antarctica, to prepare for a drilling mission on Europa."
2,Not Impressive,"If you have already created a professional, well-designed web site, you don't need this book. Save your time and money. I designed a couple of sites and picked this book up looking for some new ideas; I was disappointed.This book may be helpful if you have never created a good-looking web site before, but I do not recommend it for intermediate or advanced designers."
3,Torn,"I feel torn between my fondness for Turnage's music and the partial disappointment that this piece of music represents to me. Several movements of this piece are extremely exciting and a joy to experience. Others--the ones that feature a large proportion of improvised material--make for nice listening once or thrice, but lose their appeal quickly. One of Turnage's strong points as a composer is his marvelous talent for development. When, as in this piece, he leaves that development up to others, it leaves me wanting. As always, Turnage's orchestration is beautifully colorful and distinctive, and the movements run the gamut from placid to raucous. This was certainly a worthwhile experiment on his part, but I think that, when he places such a dependence for musical contributions on other artists, Turnage sells his potential short. I do suggest that you check out this recording, but I cannot give it my best review. I can only wait for more recordings by this wonderful composer."
1,this is only 100 cards,"The listing title states 100 cards now (not 10 times that as I guess it used to). Far too expensive, at this time approximately 5 dollars.You can get 1000 cards on Amazon for less than this - seems to be trying to trick customers, the only way this listing could stay up is that people click on it by mistake thinking that all the index cards for sale were larger packs."
2,Not as advertised,"I bought this giraffe thinking by 18 month old could ""ride"" it. Well, she can sit on it but it falls over and is not all that ""cuddly"". The reviews were high on this giraffe, but not what I was looking for:("
4,Fun but limited,"My seven year old loves this game. It's simple, it creates dramatic moments, and anyone can win.The rules are very simple - you get a limited stack of cards and then move your cute little plastic fish to attack each other using those cards. The plastic fish are fun to play with, and stacking them on top of each other as they are eaten is a simple pleasure that kids love.The real heart of the gameplay is guessing what the other player will do. Which kids are surprisingly adept at. Unfortunately, the other best strategy is counting cards, which my son isn't very interested in. But that's good, as it gives the adults at the table an edge. It's well balanced and has enough strategy to keep the adults interested but enough randomness to keep the kids in the game."
5,deep,"Bluesy, beautiful, touching and deep music. Ben Harper is today's Dylan, weaving social issues into his wide range of songs and subjects. The music is clear, sweet acoustic guitar riffs not clouded with too many noises or electric sounds. If you like soulful musics with real feeling from hope to pain and everything in between buy this. I could never listen to music with religious themes before, but Harper's tunes about piety, faith and love change that. He is sincere and deep like Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, with a smoother, simpler sound and less anger and confusion. Brings me that peaceful feeling when I listen."
2,What's so great about this album?,"I see this album has received a lot of 5 star reviews, but personally I think this album is very weak. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because track #2 is somewhat redeeming. But the rest of the CD is garbage and I regret spending money for it."
4,extra CD,"as a response to ""a music fan""'s question... i believe this is just the will to live cd along with an extra live cd that came out with it for awhile... the song's on the live CD are 'the will to live', 'faded', 'forever', 'i shall not walk alone', 'voodoo chile'... the live version of 'i shall not walk alone' is especially powerful... also, does anybody know how to get a copy of ben's show (video) on the show ""Sessions at West 54th""... let me know. 8-)>fight for your mind8-)>"
4,good product,"I was involved in sign language classes, and this helped get someof the signs down. I have two hearing impaired at work that it comes inhandy everyday.JL"
5,Opiate Blues for a Post Rock lulluby.,"With their previous ""Jimmywine"" it looked as if the Meat was gonna get them heads a bobbin' in unison. What an amazing departure this album is from their earlier work but at the same time expanding on musical themes previously hinted at. Beautiful songs, great production and guitar tones to melt away to. Too bad they broke up, but then again maybe not."
1,Don't waste your money,I had this shower head 2 months and it broke when I wasn't even using it. The parts that screw the connection on are made of cheap plastic. Now I have to take baths for 2 days until I get a better one.
5,a very good recording,I haven't heard every available version of this as some of my fellow reviewers have done. I have heard this version however and it is quite good. Both the orchestra and choir are clearly heard and perform at a high level. The soloists are also top notch. Highly recommended.
3,"Decent, modern hard-to-find Jodorowsky entry.","This was Alexandro Jodorowsky's first time in over 20 years of filmaking that he made a movie that he didn't write, which is obvious. The weirdest things in the movie is seeing Peter O'toole petting a stuffed dog and the late Christopher Lee surrounded by a bevy of sexy ladies in g-strings. Anyway, the movie is pretty good, visually. It's shot in Poland, which is also a stretch for Jodorowsky, who's utilized his homeland of Mexico for his other films. Omar Sharrif and O'toole reside in a sewer under a strange capetown,Sharrif as O'toole's ""servant"", while they wait out Lee's death so O'toole can collect inheritance money coming his way (or so he thinks!) Unfortunately, that's pretty much the plot, and there is little action, interesting dialog, or solid character developments (especially on O'toole's part), even though this is a fine film and a must for die-hard Jodorowsky fans. - Billy Sides"
2,Boring,"This book nearly bored me to tears. Unless you are interested in reading a very self-centered girl's angst, I'd say skip it."
5,Agonisingly beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!,"It is so rare to hear music like this, played with such passion and depth in this the age of mass production and indifference. On hearing the instrumentalists enter one by one, layering texture upon texture, slowly weaving together the immensely colourful fabric of this piece, I was staggered not only at the sheer beauty of the music but with the illustration of the talents that these musicians have. The depth of understanding that the performers posses allows them to portray the psychological insight that Rachmaninoff himself had into the enigmatic themes of love, pain and human fallibility. I would reccomend this recording to anyone as it allows all, even those who are less familiar with the classical and romantic genres to be enveloped into the music and for the longest time, transported into the inner depths of Rachmaninoff's emotions. It is truly beautiful, a must buy for any who know what the meaning of true beauty is to the ears."
1,Boring!!!,"I usually am determined to finish a book after I have paid good money for it, but I found this one such a waste of time I put it down half way through. The characters are unbelievable and for the most part boring. I wasn't in the least bit interested in how the two main characters ended up together - overwrought agonising over age, worth and position page after page after page! The last by this author for me."
3,a nice bonbon of a book,"A nice romance about a painter and a princess. The story is placed against the background of Mayfair Square in the first quarter of the 19 century. We have the standard 'princess oppressed by her station, in love with a commoner' story. Mayfair Square is also, apparently, the scene of more than one Stella Cameron novel. This is a story to read when you don't want to think too deeply and are looking for a feel-good read.The painter, Adam Chillworth, is in love with Princess Desiree, who returns his passion. But the princess' station in life and the fact that Adam has been cut off from his family means that there are obstacles to a union of marriage. Marriage is accomplished in order to resolve the Princess' problems, but opens the couple to further complications. Of course, this is a romance, so the suspense resides in HOW the obstacles are overcome, not in whether or not they ARE overcome. A nice bonbon!"
5,All you need to know about the Wright brothers. Great book.,"Thank the Wright brothers for helping to make the world smaller. In plain English with a sufficient number of images, this book will fill in the blanks and let you know all you need to know about the Wright brothers. A good read and fine primer on the subject."
3,OK for Beginners,"I will keep this brief because I mostly want to warn people that while this book is stated to be suitable for ages 9-12 that pre-supposes that the readers are beginner soccer players.My nine year old son, who has played soccer for a few years laughed at the simplicity and found the book not at all useful. This was of course disappointing to me. I relied on the rating, made an assumption that I should not have made and had the book sent to him without having read it.In summary, a good book for BEGINNERS aged 9-12. Live and learn!"
4,"fun, light game","This game is fun and relatively short. It doesn't elicit the same squeals and groans that some other ""press your luck"" style games do. But it's also a little less random and whacky. There's something about hearing/seeing your friends and family tell you the good or bad news that I really like (rather than everyone seeing a die roll or card flip at once.)"
1,Classic MP3 Player....,"It took me, along with my brother and uncle around 2 hours to get the software for this player to work.. nothing on the CD that came with it worked with MAC OS9, we downloaded what we needed from the internet -- the instructions were obviously not written by ""mac people"" .. after 2 hours (of translating the instructions), we got it set up - uploaded a song and realized the headphone connection was bad.. or something.. it sounded ok, but if you moved the player, or the cord the sound would cut out or it would only play out of one headphone.. ( i tried 4 pairs of headphones .. same problem) I returned it. if it had worked.. it would have been great.."
2,these books are new?,"Books that I paid for as new and they are obviously not. Damage to spine and cover, i will never go thru them again"
1,Wallis Budge fanfic,"The culture of ancient Egypt should file a restraining order on Lackey, that's really all I can say. Author not to come within five hundred words of the plaintiff and all that. Well, that and she needs to realize that, while Budge did the best he could for his time, using him as a source now is a good way to be laughed at."
4,Frontpage 2003 The Missing Manual,Excellent book full of easy to follow tips that are not in other manuals. Highly recommend.
5,A Great Book,"To bad it took an outsider to write a how to manual for Microsoft's FrontPage 2003. This is a real How To manual. I learned more from this manual than Microsoft's own book ""FrontPage 2003 Step by Step"", which I also own but was a waste of money. Not only does it tell you how to, it also has step by step practice sections. Not only does it tell you why, but how. This is not only a great book for beginners, but the advanced as well. Thanks to Jessica Mantaro we now have a manual that Microsoft should have included."
5,Frontpage missing manual,Great book -- exactly what I needed as a new user for a reference for Frontpage.
5,Crossing the Bridge of Intolerance,"Kanan Makiya succeeds where many other authors failed. A historical novel about the interplay of religions. Like Amin Maalouf, Kanan writes eloquently and with great authority about a subject difficult to most readers. He destroys long held views about identity and shows the human underneath the religious dogma.A truly wonderful work, I felt I was there and close to the characters, I had a difficulty in putting the book down, and I was upset at having finished it. I reread many segments.Please keep writing kanan, please keep enlightening us, so that more people can cross the bridge of intolerance."
5,This could be straight out of the Hartnell Era,"This book is very well written. Gareth Roberts manages to capture the spirit of the early Hartnell era, with his Doctor being a cross between the crotchety scientist, and the dotty old grand-father. Most of the jokes in it are clean, and it's a really good, well written book"
2,Doesn't work with TomTom One,"This item was advertiesed as working with a TomTom One. I selected it from the TomTom One ""accessories"". It DOES NOT work with TomTom One. Wrong plug style. Probably works fine for the appropriate device."
5,Nice product,"Yes, very nice. The only problem is that it's not working if you don't have a clear view of the sky"
4,A Radical Call To Discipleship,"Gordon Ferguson offers a radical call to discipleship by showing from the Bible how discipleship helps to protect and grow the people of God. While the International Churches of Christ have been attacked for their discipleship, too often the evangelical church could actually learn from Ferguson and the ICOC. Critics point to the legalism, harshness, and overbearing of the disciplers but one will not find this by reading Ferguson. He writes with skill and compassion.Any Christian who hungers to be a true disciple will find this book a touch of grace and honey to the soul. I highly recommend it."
4,Chlorophyl it's good for you,"I've been using this product ever since I had eaten a california roll that was prepacage and it had mold growing on it. I quickly took it back to the store and they adviced me to take this product, so to prevent any type of reaction I may have from the expired food. Well, I took it for several days and I did not get sick. Thank Goodness. During that time I began resurching the product and I found that it is a good Idea to take this once a day. I have been taking this product for 3 years and it has worked for me, my wife and my kids. No more stomach problems!"
4,Rating the Duet II Karaoke System,I was already familiar with the Duet II Karaoke System having used it previously.I needed to replace my old system and decided to use this same system again sincemy experience has been entirely positive. I am confident that I will continue to besatisfied.
4,Administrator Review,The book is a good basic outline of intervention strategies for students needing assistance beyond the standard classroom setting. It would be better if they gave specific lessons for individual skill sets.
5,Very Durable,"I've had it for a bit over a year and It has never let me down. I used to go throug a cd player every six months, but no need with this one."
3,Quality not great,"Quality was not what I expected from Corelle. Three of the dinner plates had uneven paint and paint loss on trim. Two of those have splotches of green paint on the underside of the plates. Thankfully after washing in the dishwasher, there was no change. Two of the cereal/soup bowls have stains on the inside bottoms. One stain is about quarter size and a slight rusty color. The other stain is about 2 3/4 inch light gray color. These two occurred after washing in dishwasher. They are usable."
3,Not bad,I've been through three of these. I haven't had much trouble hooking them up to hoses but my problem is that the seal on the float doesn't last very long. So eventually the water just keeps running and slowly overflows the bowl. The float does come with a second seal attached to it so that you can replace the first one when it starts leaking (if I remember correctly it's attached to the float inside the cover). Each seal lasted around 3 months so after a total of 6 months I had to replace the bowl because I couldn't find a seal to replace the bad ones. As long as you know they aren't going to last forever it isn't too bad. I'm trying to decide if it's better to just build my own with a float from Home Depot. That way if the float goes bad I can just get a new one from Home Depot for a few bucks.
2,"Nice Idea, Poor Execution","I went through three of these things before finally giving up. The hose connection is of VERY poor quality and does not seal well. I went through different hoses and multiple bowls before throwing the towel in. It did keep water level in the bowl, unfortunately, it encouraged puddles around it too since it didn't have a good seal. Maybe if they ever upgrade to a metal fitting, I'll try it again."
4,White trash runs wild,"I read this book several years ago, and it still stays with me. This story of white trash living in the south, living off of old glory, whiskey, and rage is really something good. It's a horrific account of lives that are worth nothing, and those same lives act accordingly, and in the most nasty ways. Not for the weak, but a good read!"
1,Sssssome Ideassss Ssssssuc*,"Perhaps in 1976 the shock factor appealed to a larger market and that accounts for this book still being available for purchase. Give the author this, there's no shortage of characters in this collection of pages and some are well crafted. Calling this collection of pages a novel is a stretch beyond belief."
3,direct sun must be on all parts of the panel,"I have this pump in one of my birdbaths. It works well as long as the sun is directly on the panel. If one of the leaves of my crocosmia shades even a sliver of the panel the pump stops. It doesn't work on cloudy days. I put the tube through some stacked flagstone pieces with holes in them and turned it into a rather cute fountain in the birdbath. I also have the 2.6 watt submersible pump with battery pack for my small pond. It works even on cloudy days. I can also turn it off and turn it on. The Solar Sunjet 150 is okay, but I have no control over when it's stopping and starting, cloudy days, or when the wind blows a sliver of leaf across the panel. The two water water pumps are pretty much the same. I recommend the solar pump with the battery pack over this pump."
1,dissapointed,i'm very sorry to say but the fountain didn't work.. i had to go else where to purchase another one.
3,frog fountain,"I would like to purchase the parts independently. Most of the items in the packabe are not useful to me. I sell birdbaths and I was hoping to sell fountains, but the price of the kit is prohibitive."
2,Water Fountain,Solar panels have to be under direct sun in order to work. Pump not that strong. Not unhappy but not what I expected.
2,Disappointing,"I just purchased this item to use in our new landscaping. By maximum flow of 10"" they mean if you are really lucky!. I found it to be more like 5-6"" in full sun. It does make a nice addition, but my next purchase w/ be an electric fountain/pump w/ more power."
2,Solar Powered?,"So I have a very sunny backyard and this thing still has a hard time. I tried cleaning off the panel, cleaning the pump, adjusting it, all of the manufacturers recommendations and even some tricks I know from owning other fountain pumps. I am keeping it just in case I come up with some sort of creative way to use it. But for now it is in the garage because I got tired of listening to it trying so hard to work."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"We are bird lovers and do everything we can to attract a wide variety of birds to our yard. We have a birdbath, and thought the solar pump would be a great addition for the birds' enjoyment and ours. We have lots of sun in our backyard, and therefore assumed it would be perfect for this pump. However, we wasted a birthday gift card on this item. Our expectations were not unrealistic. We understood it would not work on a cloudy day, in the shade, or any other sitaution that obstructs the sun. BUT, we DID expect it to work on SUNNY days! This is NOT the case. Even on a sunny day after we have moved the solar panel into direct sun, it might (or might not) work for about 10-15 seconds. Then--no matter where you move the panel--it will not work! The only thing this pump has brought us is frustration!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
3,"cute, but short cable and no wall mounting bracket","This little solar-powered pump is as cute as it can be, and it works fine. The miniature pump hangs below a 6"" float -- it would be perfect for attracting songbirds to a water container of any sort, providing a little landing platform for birds if the container is deep.HOWEVER, note this product description:""comes with a 16-1/2 foot connection cable, so it's easy to tuck away in the side-yard or mount up high on the garage.""That statement is not correct. The cable is only 10 feet long, and there is no wall mount bracket.I am disappointed. I had carefully measured the distance from water garden to a sunny spot on the overhead trellis, and could have made this work perfectly. There is no full-sun ground level location within 10 feet where I could place the solar panel, so it won't work for me.Caveat emptor, and all that . . ."
4,Old Leppard Fix...for now,"I previously purchased another dvd, Def Leppard Rock of Ages and was pretty disappointed. As a a huge fan of the first 3 installments from Def Leppard I was looking for footage and concerts from Pre-Hysteria.This DVD, while not completely comprehensive, offers up a lot of what I was looking for. Including a set (Die Hard the Hunter) from the Hysteria tour at the now defunct McNichols Arena in Denver.The early videos really brought me back. Hello America and Let It Go were great.Hopefully, Def Leppard puts a few more concerts out on DVD for fans of their earlier work but for now this works."
5,perfect,This was a birthday gift for a friends son. He watched it at least 10 times in 24 hours and was planning on having it shown on the big screen @ the club where he is having his birthday party.
1,TOO SHORT ! LEGO FIGURE IS WACK!,"Way to short! I would have returned it, but my son destroyed the box getting the Lego Figure out. The Lego figure sucks also. It's tiny, you can't even move the legs. This product was used to line George Lucas' pockets even more than they already are."
5,Really gets your attention.,"90% of this shpw is better then good. It really gets your attention. Personally, I like Kate!But that is my choice. Buy the set you will not be sorry."
4,The Kate Thing .... Just way too stupid ... but I took heed,"If the pilot were representative of the whole show, this would be a 5-star review. The pilot was well-written and laugh-out-loud funny. After a couple of episodes, it was down to 3 stars. By the end, the whole Kate music-box thing had rendered it almost unwatchable. I am ok with suspending disbelief, but come on, suspending disbelief and suspending IQ aren't the same thing. The woman is walking around playing clue games and someone is supposed to take this seriously, the fact that she is in serious jeopardy? If this bit of boring dumb weren't the underpinning of so much of the show, it wouldn't have trashed the whole show, but it is and it does.P.S. Took heed of the comments and yes, it did get better once Kate died! Raised from two to four stars."
5,AWESOME!!!,i love White Collar. absolutely amazing television. great show. 100% recommend. plus Matt Bomer is very attractive :)
5,Excellent Show,"I am new to this show, but have been watching since I discovered it. I think the various characters all have qualities that are fun to watch and this show is different than the usual fare of cop type shows. It's funny at times and altho the characters are not sure whether to trust each other, they have an interesting sort of friendship and will help each other when the going gets rough. Love the show."
2,Mandie & Marriage,Gee. Everyone is forgetting about Tommy! I want Mandie to marry Tommy! I'm rooting for him. Although I know most are probably rooting for Joe. It'll be WAY too predictable if she marries Joe.
5,Worth every cent.,"This is a fine collection of old recordings and while the quality of the sound may be slightly less than what we are used to today, the fact that we have these recordings, itself, is a wonder. Cliff Edwards was a great performer and I am glad to have these samples of his talent. I am only sorry there aren't more of his records available."
1,Keep shopping. You DON'T want this stockpot!,"When I first got this stockpot, I lifted the box and thought sure it was empty! My old stockpot was MUCH heavier, and maybe that's why it worked better. No matter how low the heat, and how frequently I stirred, food burned to the bottom EVERY time. I would have returned it, but didn't use it the first time until after it was too late to do that. Don't buy this, unless you are willing to ruin the flavor of a large quantity of food."
1,Flimsy,"This pot is usable, if you're heating high water content foods at low heats, but for anything else the bottom is far too thin, and the walls and handles aren't any better. The other reviewer who said they've seen thicker tin cans is spot on. I bought this pot in 2008 (before there were any reviews on it), and I heartily wish I had not wasted my money. For the price you can do much much better. I replaced this with aPrime Pacific 18/10 Stainless Steel 20 Quart Stock Pot With Glass Lidwhich I've been very happy with."
3,I'm Glad I Read this Book,"This isn't the best book on the Philadelphia Experiment but it does add some interesting points. I was very much intrigued by Al Bielek, Montauk, and the M.K. Jessup seance. (Note: It will make you think twice about your surroundings and the possible hidden secrets of time travel and invisibility)"
2,This book asks many more questions than it answers.,"I expected a more comprehensive study of the Philadephia Experiment. This book prints some of the rumor behind the project but fails to follow up in depth on even the rumors. It seems to have been designed as a primer to whet the neophyte's interest, but unfortunately the neophyte does not come away from this book knowing substantially more than when coming to it. Too bad, because the entire saga raises a myriad of fascinating issues and questions. Perhaps this book was written merely to cash in on the perennial interest in the Philadelphia Experiment. Unfortunately, this ground is rife with tall tale tellers and out-and-out con artists. Without hard proof, the entire story is destined to remain nothing more than muttled legend and grist for the lunatic fringe's mills."
4,Wonderfully different!,"This was a great break for me when I read it. A stand-alone novel, quick-paced enough to read in one sitting if you feel like it, it's a 'real world' take on sorcery, without the assumption that there's a whole fantastic world of elves and dragons just hidden out there in the shadows. The basic plot is that a sorcerer is looking for his brother, who's recently gone missing. If you've ever read Katherine Kurtz's Adept series, then this book was a lot like those. If you like this but haven't read them, then GO DO IT! They're even better."
4,More words to (and from) the wise,"After I read and enjoyed The Meaning of Everything, tackling this book (which I saw reviewed in The Weekly Standard) was a natural ""second step"" for me. Hitchings includes sufficient background material on Samuel Johnson to enlighten the uninformed without losing sight of his major goal, which is to demonstrate how Johnson tackled the daunting task of compiling an English dictionary in the 18th century with few models and minimal help available. Cleverly, Hitchings uses actual definitions of words from Johnson as the equivalents of chapter titles (I wonder just how long he had to fish through the dictionary to find words and definitions to match the progress of his narrative). An excellent effort."
3,good but not great,"While I enjoyed the book a lot, I specifically did NOT like the way it jumped from the past to the present. Just as I was beginning to feel like I was part of the expedition (which Ambrose did a great job of), he rips me into the present to hear what his kids think when experiencing the same sites. Quite honestly, I couldn't care less and it ruined the mood for me..."
2,Disappointed,"The owl looks absolutely NOTHING like what the picture shows, and it was definitely not as tall as the page claimed it to be. It came in a bad condition and generally looks ugly. The eyes are different and the wings and tail were folded up."
1,Looks nice....but,"Certainly looks nice but the sound was not very good, as it was only for the bedroom I was not that bothered as it was mainly used very low. But it was very slow to load and the surface of the player showed lots of tiny cracks after minimal use. The unit packed in after six months and customer services did not want to know. For me this has been a waste of money, shame as it looked so nice."
2,A die hard Def Leppard fan that was not impressed!,"There are two DVD collections out by Def Leppard. ""Historia/In The Round In Your Face"" and this one. The best way to describe these two DVD's is the rise and fall of Def Leppard. This one, of course, being the fall. This DVD is Def Leppard without Steve Clark, and in my opinion Def Leppard died when Steve did. They do a good acoustic ""Iggy Stardust"" on this DVD. Maybe they ought to play David Bowie songs from now on. They don't seem to have any direction, and it shows in this DVD. People that liked their ""Slang"" album might like this, but if you are a fan from their 80's music style, I would think twice before buying this one. Vivian Campbell doesn't even come close to playing like Steve Clark....... by a long run!"
5,TO LOVE AGAIN,The DVD's came in record time and were packaged very well. I bought them for Xmas gifts so I did not watch them The Eddy Duchin Story is one of my all time favorite moives and I thought it would be a nice gift to give to my friends who may have not seen it.
5,Very thorough account,"This was an excellent story, meticulously researched by the author and presented as if he were actually there to witness it all. Awesome, suspenseful hurricane tale."
5,A chronicle of the 20th century par excellence!,"The author, whose works we have admired previously, captures the essence of 20th century media and the strangeness therein throughout his elegaic Shadows, Angels and Joe Dimona.The contributions of Dimona and his kind might be understated or underappreciated but many but they are central to the latter half of the 20th - a truly American century.I had the privilege of meeting the late Tom Lahey, whose obituary in the NY Times did not do justice to his contributions so young Mr. Nirschel's work must suffice."
4,Great CD,"""The Sound of your Voice"" is a great CD with a refreshing blend of musical styles- from melodic Rock to more heavy tracks, such as the title cut. I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves good music and/or are curious to hear Harnell's great voice in something different than a cartoon show!"
3,Modern Latin Music,"I enjoy this particular CD especially the songs; each one had a personality of their own. The Kumbia Kings group did a okay job presenting their titles. Overall, They could of been more selective about some songs which I didn't personally really didn't care for."
5,Great Book,This is such a great book! It is so interesting and just an overall great read! I know Steve Watkins and he is such a great guy as well! I would recommend this book to anyone!
1,It was a very poor review of Chemistry concepts,"First, The book had a lot of errors. Second, the tests in this book ( although there are 6 of them) are much easier than the AP Exam and it excludes a lot of concepts that the actual AP exam stresses. So I would stay away from this book."
3,Difficult assembly,"My 6 yr old loves trains and wanted to put a train together himself (with dad's help). We found this train online and to start off we paid the extra money for faster shipping. Don't waste your time, it still took well over a week to get the train.Once the train arrived it took them about an hour or so to put the train together. When they were nearly finished my husband stripped a gear and now the train will not run. He stated it was difficult to put together and stipping the gear was almost inavoidable.My son was playing with it that day and had left it on a ledge. It was accidentally knocked off and broke in three pieces.Over all I am sure the train would work fine if these things hadn't happened to it. My main complaint is the difficult assembly that smaller children will not be able to do it."
4,Not as Durable as I Hoped,"My girlfriend bought this for me, and it was beautiful and I was proud of it's simple elegance. However, I am very active, use tools, go to beaches, climb trees, and soon it was quite scratched. If you don't plan on being so rough with it, this is a great ring.(I went on to acquire a titanium ring which held up much better, albeit with a little less shine.)"
4,The Curve Train is Back on Track!,"I was really bummed when Curve called it quits a few years ago. Then came the random single here and there, keeping hope alive. Could it be that they were still kicking? Enter Come Clean. The familiar Pulsating beats, interesting sounds, and now you can actually grasp most of Toni Halliday's lyrics out of the mix that in the past would have been next to impossible to decode. I have enjoyed all of Curve's releases and this one definitely puts them back on track! Gee, where do you think Garbage, Sneaker Pimps, and others got their sound and influence? Curve is responsible for all of these bands existing and is a very important band indeed."
3,Fine for the $$,"purchased for a school play, fine for the $ paid, quite cute on a small girl. If purchasing for Halloween or outdoor use would recommend layering up underneath as fabric is quite thin."
1,Good balls...HORRIBLE Price,I buy these everytime I need balls but for this price you can buy nearly two cans at Dicks. Definitely not worth a buy online. Go to just about any sporting goods store and you can find these same balls for way less.
1,"Be careful - only three balls, not three cans!","This product is very misleading - when choosing the quantity 3, there is a list price of well over twenty dollars, implying that you are buying three cans of balls rather than a single can of 3 balls (especially since choosing a quantity of one has a list price of about 10 dollars) Beware: this is just one can! My question is: if I choose a quantity of 1, do I really get a can with a single ball? Doubtful."
4,So cute,"This book is adorable in its simple illustrations and bright colors. It can teach kids the value of just being yourself and having your own style, even if people laugh at you sometimes."
3,A reprint!,"I own over 25 books relating to Faberge and Russian goldsmithing...some older, some exciting to have found in the ""marketplace"", most are insightful and then there is that rare ""blah"" exception...and this is one of the latter...had I realized this was a new reprint of an 89 title I wouldn't have been shocked...the Faberge photos are by now all familiar (with the rare exception) as is the saga of Forbes and his quest. Although some of the lesser known artists have been brought to light here it just seems to lack that ""spark"" despite a shining new format!Beyond a 7 pound reference base for photographs nothing much will be added to one's collection on the master and those who envied his talents...I am sorry to say! I hope Faber's new book will stand out above this one!"
4,"ONE SMALL RESERVATION , OTHERWISE TERIFFIC","one of musics' original angry young men delivers a very good concert to an appreciative and polite japanese audience . unfortunately TOM TEELEY (while being a very good rhythm guitarist and fair lead) is no VINNIE ZUMMO . VINNIE who delivers concise , coherent , involving jazz/rock solos is absent here . ZUMMO was the lead guitarist on ""BIG WORLD"" , ""BODY AND SOUL"" and ""BLAZE OF GLORY"" to indicate several . TOM is an adequate rock musician and acquits himself quite well here though . other than that single carp , the concert comes highly recommended ."
1,Nothing new here,"I had to read this book for a class taught by the author. There are not really any new ideas here. A person who has never been exposed to genre, character type and a three-act structure might find it useful. I found the dissection and analyses dry and un-insightful. Serious and seasoned screenwriters may be disappointed."
3,As advertised,"These are as advertised and pretty much what I expected, except the colors are a little bright. No big deal since I wear them UNDER my jeans."
1,ripped off,Advertised as new. Obviously not. Does not hold a charge as well as my old battery which has been in my phone for 2+ years.1 star because there's no option for 0.
1,Wont keep a charge,This battery will not keep a charge. I'm better off with the battery that I was wanting to replace. After one call it needs to be charged.
2,For some reason,"This doesn't work as well as the original - goes dead in just over a day. The reason I wanted a replacement was to replce the old, this just isn't as good. Oh well, at least it was cheap."
1,BT50 battery,"The BT50 battery that I ordered arrived quickly and the price was very good. Unfortunately, the battery died after a week or so. It is too small an itemto return for a replacement."
4,Motorola BT50 Cell Phone Batteries,Product received was exactly as described. Works great. Great value. Would purchase again from this vendor.
4,They are good but the cheaper alternative is a better value.,these cartoons have not been restored. The other Amazon product Classic Cartoons (B00063QD6G) is cheaper and has been restored without the problems that you see in these. The colors are also more vivid. Take a look at the other ones. I have a large collection of cartoons and if you want a good value check out the ones that I have noted here. I just wish that they(Starling Films) offered more of these.
3,Incomplete image on some cartoons,"Great selections yet some of the cartoons are zoom-ins of the originals. If you have some VHS copies of some of the musicals, this becomes obvious - how else can you explain cropped heads / feet and sides in some instances?"
4,Perfect except for one thing...,"Love this DVD & was waiting for it a long time. The voice only tracks that include Mel Blanc outtakes are especially great. FINALLY has What's Opera Doc on it + like 4 tracks & a featurette!I also love seeing the Bugs bunny & Tweety show openings & how it morphed over the years. Boy, that brought me back to being a kid watching ABC on Saturday mornings b/f Disney bought it!My only complaint is that it says the 1st Looney Tune ""Sinkin' in the Bathtub"" is on Disc 4 & I can't find it on ANY of the disc. I've seen this elsewhere on-line so I don't think I'm the only one who can't find it... If it's an easter egg, it's a DARN GOOD ONE!"
2,Not a lot of good cartoons on this collection,I was disappointed with this collection of cartoons. In my opinion there are very few good episodes.
3,Disappointing followup to Volume One,"Cartoons seem to have been randomly chosen. Sound on What's Opera, Doc was not as clear as we'd have expected. Seems like there was little effort to restoration this time, esp. when compared with Volume One. A whole disc devoted just to Sylvester and Tweety?!"
5,ANOTHER GREAT COLLECTION,"This is a great collection to add to your classic cartoon collection , it is unedited , perfectly restored sound and picture, A++++++++++++++ HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
5,Keep'em comin WB,"Hi There, I,m a big looney tunes fan. I loved the first DVD collection, and the 2nd installment promises to be a sucsess as well. However, I would kindly request the folks at WB who pick these shorts to include the following shorts in the coming collection (or the 3rd collection if possible):- Bugs Bonnets- The Honey-Mousers- Hoppy Daze- Ali Baba Bunny- Transylvania 6-5000- Hare-Abian Nights- Cat-tails for Two- Hillbilly Hare- There is also one short which I would love to see, I don't remember the title, but it involves Bugs Bunny trying to help get a baby penguin back to his home in the South Pole (or the North Pole).My ultimate dream is to get the whole 1000+ Looney tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts on DVD, I am certianly a buyer.Thank you very much, and keep'em comin."
3,NO HILLBILLY HARE!!,"THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE WITH THIS AND THE ORIGIANL LOONEY TOONS GOLDEN COLLECTION IS A SHORTAGE OF ""FOGHORN LEGHORN"" AND THE GREATEST OF ALL BUGS BUNNY EPISODES ""HILLBILLY HARE"" WHERE BUGS TAKES OVER A SQUARE DANCE CALLER'S JOB AND LEADS TWO HILLBILLIES INTO BEATING EACH OTHER SENSELESS. ITS THE BEST BUGS EVER AND TWICE IT HAS BEEN SNUBBED!!"
4,Cartoon Classics,"A good compilation of various Looney Tunes cartoons. It includes one of my favorites: ""What's Opera Doc"". The quality is excellent. It does have some lame cartoons as filler, but this is a very subjective opinion so take it for what it's worth."
5,Too good!!,"I have this whole series now and love all the books! In this one Samantha must take care of six mischievous children, WOW! My hat went off to her with some of the pranks the children played on her! My Favorite Bride has the laughter, passion, good natured fun, and mystery I love in a book! One of my favorites in Christina Dodds The Governess Brides series if you haven't read her books check out her website for a reading order!!"
3,how about some original plots?,I wish Ms. Dodd would try to get something a little more original out there. Its so dissapointing and off-putting to read something that's so ho-hum! Even though her writing is pretty good the Sound of Music plot put me off so much that I just scanned through the book without much enthusiasm.
4,Solid thriller combo.,"The Silence of the Lambs-Probably the most genuinely disturbing psychological thriller ever made, Silence of the Lambs is a must see, but its dramatic power, dark insight into the human psyche, and ugly violence (most of which is implied) ensures it's unlikely you'll watch this film more than once. But on a first viewing, almost nothing matches this thriller's heart-pounding suspense, from Hannibal Lecter's attempted escape to the literally dark climax. Howard Shore's foreboding score adds nicely to the intense atmosphere.**** 1/2 out of *****Hannibal-This underrated sequel looks and feels quite different from its predecessor. It has no intention of excelling as a pyschological thriller, but neither is this a straight through-and-through gorefest. Certainly entertaining but hardly mind-blowing, Hannibal is at least visually stylish and unpredictable, if not also somewhat silly.*** 1/2 out of *****"
1,face mask too claustrophobic,My son ended up taking the mask off soon after leaving to go trick or treating. It was too hot and stuffy. Needless to say the costume just didn't make it without the mask.
2,mmmm....,"well, great photos, i found it to be incredibly user friendly & intuitive... but the thing died in 3 weeks. took some gorgeous shots on the california coast, not in the rain, not in the snow, simply a few days during weather in the low 60's with some breeze... not even any sand whizzing around. and now the mechanism that extends and retracts the lens has locked up. nuts. sent an inquiry for replacement and all i got was a ""we received your inquiry and are currently in processing. we will contact you shortly""... that was 10 days ago. i never imagined a digital camera would be quite THIS fragile... maybe i just got a bum one... ??... hoping i get a replacement before (a potentially last) christmas dinner with my sick grandfather..."
4,"It's OK, but be careful","This radar detector does seem to work well, but sometimes your safe response time can be really short. Whenever it alerts, slow down immediately. I got cocky and took about 2.5 seconds to gradually slow down, and I got a ticket. So, always slam on the brakes immediately whenever there's an alert."
5,Save your rear,"I've seen this detector pick up sneaky police up to a mile away, the VG-2 works great as well,supposedly there are better units out but I'm sure they would cost a lot more."
2,Another Bel Disappointment,"I've also had many detectors and finally decided to spend good money for a detector that I thought would do the job, (not alot of false alerts ect)well I was really disapointed in this detector- 965. Your supposed to be able to turn off the X band to eliminate the annoying alerts your receive on this band,, Well,after turning it off it still gave audio X alerts.(Yes I read the instructions).Way to many false alerts, the unit is heavy and bulky, windshield mount is not a winner either.The best thing about this detector was getting rid of it!! Seriously,as I said above I have had many detectors, (2nd Bel) and I'm not a ""rookie"" when it comes to using them, but this one, Bel 965 is bad !! Spend the extra bucks and get the Passport 8500 x50.If you need to fill the space in your glove box or under your seat this is the detector for you."
4,A pleasant peek into those days,"Rather than historical fiction, this is a peek into the reality of those times through the eyes of one woman who sought sainthood. I wish we had more books of people who had written about their own lives at that time. From the perspective of the present time Margery Kempe was kind of a nut - although she didn't realize it - but then maybe her kind was so prevalent in those days, that she wasn't considered to be that weird. At any rate I found it fun to read and be transported back to that time. Louise Collis' explanations render the book easy to follow."
2,Flimsy card,"It's as described, but it's very thin paper. I was hoping for something sturdy, and these cards are just barely thicker than printer paper. Disappointing but not worth the hassle of returning!"
4,Important Learning Text,"One of the textbooks in my Clinical Hypnotherapy course. I recommend it to therapists who want to see how a highly skilled old-time guy like Gil does some pretty slick work. I could not have understood what he was doing, though, without having seen him on video. It helps, too, to be already familiar with instant inductions. Not for beginners."
5,Great cookbook!,Some of these recipes are amazing! I've only tried a few but can't wait to try them all!Already planning our next holiday meal. :)
2,Not that impressed.,"I was underwhelmed by this cookbook. I expected recipes that were closer to the original type recipes, but still vegetarian. I found the recipes to be boring, and most recipes used the same or similar ingredients in each one. Just didn't seem inspired or creative cooking to me. I will be selling my copy."
4,WORKS GOOD,"Works good, connects at close to 56k. It would get five stars but it won't connect to flex.com. Thats not much of a knock because I have not found very many modems that will connect to flex.com. It would be nice if it had a led on the card to indicate activity."
2,DONT BOTHER!,"I purchased this book because of the great reviews that I read on amazon and it was a descison I really regret. This book took me well over a week to finish, the dialogue was crude and I lost my interest immediately after 20 pages. I'm very surprised at all the high ratings this book got! If you want to read a better sci book/romance try Christine feehan. I almost gave this book a 1 but because of the original plot.. heres 2."
1,Not what I expected based on other reivews...........,"****See my review for Master of the Night, also by Angela Knight.Interchange the names of the books and a few facts, and pretty much the review of this book is the same. I honestly couldn't find anything to like about this book, except maybe the talking wolf. Baran, a warrior from 300 years in the future, was pulled off a major mission and inexplicably sent to the past to save Jane from Jack the Ripper/Druas - yet we find out that she was supposed to really die, and not actually be saved at all??? So why would the TE bother sending Baran at all? What's up with that?If you want any sort of intelligent erotica, you will not find it with this book."
5,Fun Fun Fun! and Erotic!,"I really love Angela Knight, she is a very HOT writer and this is a fine example of her work. This was a fun read and a HOT read. A keeper too. You will enjoy this book. I know I did!"
4,Rated M for Mature,"This genre-bending novel combines romance, thriller, sf & erotica in an engaging read that will not be to all readers' tastes. I am not personally drawn to explicit sex scenes in romance. I am particularly not drawn to those which use the kind of language this one does--the ""c"" word for male anatomy, for instance. It's a testament to Knight's skills as a writer that I finished the book anyway. For those readers with a higher tolerance for those elements, this could be a very good read. Knight has an impressive writing style which separates her out from the herd.I didn't dock the book for the explicit sex--although since this rating is supposed to reflect my objective tastes I probably ought to. I docked it for not fully following through with one of the hero's major quests, which made the story's resolution feel a little limp."
2,Disappointing,"I saw a couple of good reviews for this book and thought I was in for a treat...the storyline and plot was a little too much to believe; a genetically engineered talking timber wolf is the ""partner"" for the warlord in question...The author starts to paint an abusive background for the title character Jane, but never really develops it...you are left hanging at the end wondering if her mother is dead or alive.....the sex is very steamy and descriptive, but without a good story it doesn't really help."
4,This is a really good buy,"This is one of the better Sebadoh c.d.'s. It isn't personally my favorite but it really is awesome. ""On Fire"" is a great song. I can sit there and listen to it over and over. This band is great because they have some mellow songs and some that are really wild, especially in ""Bubble and Scrape"" and ""Smash your head on the punk rock"" This c.d. is all mellow and that's what I like least about it. It is a great c.d. to just sit and chill to. It is very soothing."
4,All of the little Sebadoh pieces have fallen together....,"Somewhere in the middle of Lo-Fi & Hi-Fi lies Harmacy. ""On Fire"", a masterpiece, shows Sebadohs capability. ""Too Pure"" and ""Open Ended"", The ideal sound for Sebadoh, and ""Willing to Wait"" is whispering perfection. Most of the 19 songs are notable and if they would have trimmed this album down to 12 songs...who knows, It could be the perfect album to play straight through. But ""Shame About Ray"" by the Lemonheads (their Boston Brothers) still takes the cake. Don't get me wrong, it's still in my top 15 of all time because there's always a song for every mood."
1,NOT TAPELESS AT ALL!,Product is advertised as tapeless.. NONE of their products is tapeless. Company rep says that's the way they ALL are. Rear windows are tape on only. Bad/False advertising.
1,Please read before buying this!!!,"I am a die hard Gundam fan. Everything from the 0079 series to Turn A and even Wing. Gundam has a very big cult following and for us fans it is an animated world full of action, drama, mystery and suspense. It is sad to see how G-Saviour bastardized the Gundam universe. The only thing worth watching is the 5 minutes of CG which isn't really all that great. The plot is REALLY bad, the acting is horrible, the characters are VERY plain and one dimensional. If you are a Gundam fan please don't purchase this poor excuse for a movie...if you do they'll only start making more poor work like this. Unfortunately this was an impulse buy and I am stuck with it (the people I have offered to give it away to don't want it). Spend your money elsewhere...perhaps start exploring other Anime/Mecha titles such as Getter Robo or Big O. If not go ahead and burn your money...it's probably more enjoyable to watch than this movie."
2,You Are Not Gundam.,"I would like to point those reading this review back up to the top of the page and ask them to look at the title of this product. Notice how, nowhere on it, you will find the word ""Gundam"" in it? (If you read the part above the title, well, you were doing it wrong~) That's because, quite simply, this is not Gundam. I rented this movie from a video store, and I'm grateful I did, because purchasing it would have been such a waste of money. I managed to make it through about 40 minutes of so-called acting before I had to stop. A cheesy plot, bad characters and acting, horrid mechanical designs and no real sign of what makes Gundam, well, Gundam.There's a reason most, if not all, Gundam fans have disowned this movie from the Gundam timelines, universes, and the series. It's straight up BAD. Unless you're looking for a good ""I dare you!"" movie, save yourself the time and money, and just walk away."
5,A phenomenal recording,"I had the distinct pleasure of seeing Simien perform most of the songs on this CD at the House of Blues in Boston. The recordings are true to his live performance. All are exceptional. As a Zydeco collector, I rate this album as one of the very best I have ever heard. He will win a Grammy!"
4,High emotion on this CD,"I'm a romantic guy and although I do like a few of the songs on this CD, such as ""Saved""(by The Spill Canvas), the one song that I can completely relate to is titled, simply, ""Superman""(or as I just like to call it, ""you don't know what it's been like"") by the Receiving End of Sirens. I relate to the EXTREME strong emotion that is in the lead singer's voice as he screams ""You don't know what it's been like, meeting someone like you!""; there is this girl who I like (although I'm shy and can't bring myself to talk to her) and I cry each time I listen to it because it makes me think of her and how important it is that she has struck me in my life; I want her to know that I've noticed her, let her know through the words ""you don't know what it's been like meeting someone like you""."
5,Highly recommended!,"Being a huge fan of Felicity, I waited for the release of its soundtrack with eagar anticipation. I could not wait to own the many heartwrenching and memorable tunes that accompanied many episodes. Kate Bush's hauntingly beautiful ""This Woman's Work"" , the very talented Amy Jo Johnson's ""Puddle of Grace"", Peter Gabriel's classic and Scout's ""Day Before Yesterday"" are just some of the few that stood out. I was, however, highly disapointed to learn that my fave track, Kate Bush's ""This Woman's Work"", was taken out of its local release here. Note to would-be buyers.. get the original full 15 track US version and u will not be disappointed. This album is a gem..get yours today!"
5,"Great singers, great lyrics, great music, great soundtrack!","I bought this soundtrack for Amy Jo Johnson's song ""Full of Grace."" It is beautifully written! Heather Nova is, also, one of my favorite artists... Her voice is incredible and if you have not heard of her yet, this is a great CD to just get a little taste of what she is about. You cannot go wrong with this CD... Sarah's on it! What more do you want?"
4,Must read for those with children with tics!!,"This book is eye-opening and thought-provoking. Just consider the possibility of your child being tic-free or at least know you might have the chance of reducing the incidence of tics without medication. Get this book, and share it with others."
2,The weakest link so far in the Decker/Lazarus series,"The book starts off well, as a mystery should, with the events of the murder of Dr. Sparks. But then it spends the next 300 or so pages batting back and forth, and not really going anywhere. Plus the relationship between Rita Lazarus' deceased husband and the priest are totally incongruious, as I'm sure Kellerman realized when she threw in this rather burdensome plot twist.However, the end of the book really does pull some surprises. You just have to plod through the middle to get there. Not her best work."
2,This book kept me thinking,"I have never read Faye Kellerman before, and I expected something different from this book, because I had read her husband's work, which was not religious in any way.""Prayers for the Dead"" did much to disguise the real killer. However, after wading through a lot of Jewish vs. Christian material, it was hardly a surprise to see that the UN-Christian, UN-holy bikers had perpetrated the evil plot.On Mrs. Kellerman's behalf, I can say that the book was very accurate on all accounts. However, the actual plot lacked ""twist"" due to the abrupt ending wherein those who hated gays were those who hated authority.Perhaps if I had more experience related to the Jewish lifestyle, I would more fully appreciate this work. Nevertheless, I read it until the end and was happy to see that the Catholic priest was innocent, despite his tragic death.Not much of a review, considering that I've told the whole plot...but, there you have it."
2,Absolutely unbelievable.,"No Jew as religious as Rina would allow her husbnad to be tended by clergy of another faith, or even by non-devout Jewish clergy.In the real world, Rina and her first husband would have returned to Brooklyn. Just garbage to write this tripe."
1,NOTHING HAPPENED!,"Well I guess we won't be needing pointless books like this anymore; the world didn't end, and there weren't any y2k problems. I only feel bad for all you people who spent money on books like this."
2,Not for me,"There wasn't a single likable character in this book. The heroine was a pathetic, spineless girl who spent the entire time chasing a man who was verbally abusive to her and the hero was a self-centered jerk who made himself feel better by constantly belittling and humiliating his wife. I could not figure out why either one of them even wanted to be together; halfway through the book, I no longer cared. I'm all for flawed characters, but they should at least be likable."
1,awful,"A preposterous plot, which verges close to pedophilia. It's a rare book I don't finish reading, this is one of them."
1,Cardboard...,"I've heard people describe horrible food as tasting like cardboard before. I never quite knew what they meant until now. This really does taste like cardboard. I don't think I could give these a way. They are trash. Don't waste your money. Here is a better low carb sweet snackBlue Diamond Almonds Cinnamon Brown Sugar, 8-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)"
1,Horrible,"I had already bought this product from another website before and I generally love it. However, the one I bought from this supplier tasted horrible and it also tasted like someone dropped ashes in it. This comes with 12 packages and I opened 3 to make sure that it was not just a problem with the one package. Because this was so horrible, I could not bring myself to try the rest so the rest of it will be going into the garbage."
5,Singing so good the songs can't get out of one's head.,"For a few days after I first heard 'The Meeting', snatches of the melody lingered and made me wish I could sing in Russian. Then another song on this CD had the same effect, and another still. Hvorostovsky's philosophy of doing justice to the repertoire of his native place has produced a wonderful result. A delightful contrast to the later 'Kalinka'."
4,Incredibly Well Done Television!,"It's too bad that so few people know of this series, for it is one of the most well put-together television series I've ever seen. The series as a whole gets an easy 5-stars from me, but I plan to rate every episode so this particular box set gets its own score of 4-stars. Here are my thoughts on the individual episodes.The Disappearence of Mr. Davenheim - Decent, but not great this one seems way to similar to Conan Doyle's ""The Man With The Twisted Lip"" to me, but not as good. - 3 starsThe Veiled Lady - Better than the first, but somewhat silly all throughout with a strange, but minor, flaw in the solution. Also the chase scene near the end was too drawn out. - 3.5 starsThe Lost Mine - Perhaps a glimpse of the greater future of the Poirot series, this one shines with a more interesting case and a more interesting solution. Also, watching Poirot and Hastings play Monopoly is priceless - 4 starsBox Set Overall score (Not an Average) - 4 stars"
5,Awesome System,"You can't beat this kind of system for this price. 1000 WATTS, 7.1 Surround, 6-DISC DVD Player. Very Happy with this purchase."
4,Great toy for toddler.,"My two year old loves make-up. ""Make-ups"" as she calls them. She loves the ""make-ups"" isle at the store more than the toy isle. This product was a great gift for her, because she is so young she just can't have the real thing! This set was a compromise the fill her Christmas morning dreams. I would have liked the brushes in the set to be real brushes, but otherwise I am happy with it. The ""nail polish"" is great and the lipstick looks real. She loves her ""make-ups"". (I think as she gets older she will not be as happy with a fake set.)"
1,Not useful for English-speaking students of Chinese,"The New Oxford Pciture Dictionary (English/Chinese) is not useful for English-speaking students of Chinese. There is no transliteration for the Chinese characters, which are printed in a very hard-to-read light blue ink. This dictionary could be useful to Chinese-speaking students of English. However, they would need a good knowledge of the Western alphabet and sound system to use it."
3,it's ok,"This is a nice and easy to use watch, however if you buy it Keep in mind that it does scratch easely and after the first day you wear it it's no longer pink and once it gets dirty it's imposible to clean!"
2,Timex T5E341,"No me gustó mucho este reloj porque casi no tiene funciones, el cronometro solo cuenta hasta una hora y no se puede separa en vueltas lo cual si se esta entrenando es poco eficiente, no tiene microsegundos, aunq esto no es muy relevante, tampoco se puede dejar en modo nocturno...I don't like this watch because it can't split the chronometer, and only count 1 hour, if you are working out isnt efficient, sorry for my english i don't speak english..."
5,great watch,This is a great watch the Indiglo is a little dim. A comfortable fit. Easy functions. Big numbers. Great watch.
5,There is nothing like UGG boots,"I have tried various faux UGG boots because the real ones are expensive. But, here's the truth - I've paid more for multiple faux UGGs than I would have paid for one real pair, and there is no comparison in terms of comfort and fit. UGGs are simply the best."
5,Daughter Very Happy!!!,"My daughter was really stoked to get these. I never heard of UGGs before, but I guess it is the in thing for the kids these days.I was just happy to have a Pong set when I was her age."
5,Looks great!,The Ugg's were brand new out of the box. Official tag from Ugg on the box and on the boot. My daughter was very happy!!
3,Order your true size unless you wear without socks,"I wear a size 8.5 and one reviewer wrote to order a size SMALLER. I ordered size 8 and the boots are too small to wear with socks. If I wear thin socks they end up bunching up at the bottom of my feet within a few minutes which is very annoying and uncomfortable. I didn't return them, hoping they would adjust to my feet after a while, but they never did. For the money I paid, I am disappointed that these are not ""the most comfortable boots"" as previously reviewed. I recommend you order your true size to get the best fit."
3,UGG,"I'm surprised they aren't softer on the inside and the stitching around the UGG tag is coming undone. My thirteen year old is thrilled all the same to have a pair of UGGs, she understands the expense of such a surprise. I'm thinking this may be a one time experience for us."
5,totally positive experience,my wife used to hate fur and now that she has a pair of these boots she says she will never wear anything else. the seller delivered the product on time and as advertised an all-around positive experience with a great price
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THESE CROOKS!,"Paid $150 for 'Uggs', These arrived with TWO RIPS/HOLES, POOR STITCHING, and a STAIN! These are bad knockoffs. The company is a bunch of crooks!!! Do not buy from them EVER!! Also I am not happy with Amazon's customer service/returns. Done with Amazon forever..."
4,Great Boots but take care of them!!,"I've had these boots for about 2 years, and I really like them. There stylish and comfy. I am a twelve year old girl, and EVERY girl in my school has these, so there kind of a must have!! I wear these everyday, but after about 2 years of wearing them, they have tons of water stains and they are kinda messed up. So I recommend getting the ""ugg care kit"" with these boots, but other than that they are great!"
1,Shoes not worth the price,"I do NOT recommend these boots. I received them, and they did NOT appear to be new. I was very disappointed and had to mail them back. So far, I have NOT received a refund or a replacement from the seller."
2,Overpriced POS,"I don't get why girls love these boots so much, there are other brands like bear paw where they are less than half the price. I think this is a bit ridiculous."
5,Treat yourself!,"Have been wanting a pair of these for several years and this year I was finally able to afford them. Bought the sand color which go with everything. Very well made and, of course, are as toasty warm as everyone says. Next year I may treat myself to a black pair!"
1,used? or just bad product?,"These uggs came in a box that was smashed (the actual box inside the shipping box). Missing an insert, missing the little card, wrapped in white tissue paper that was crumpled. Had the boots for ten minutes before I notice an inch long split on one side. Umm, no. Not for 150 dollar boots! Sent back the next day."
5,ugg boots,I'm very happy with the Ugg boots I ordered for my daughter's birthday. My order came very quickly and since receiving them I have heard that I saved forty dollars over the mall stores!
3,Lacks care instructions that should accompany a quality product,The boots are great but come with no care instructions at all. The care instructions that come with the care products are also very poor. Hard to understand why such a quality product would not have good care instructions other than the fact the manufacturer would prefer one to ruin the boots so you will buy more !!!!!!!!
1,got very disappointed,I was waiting for it as it was a surprise gift to my daughter but unfortunately after I received it I found out that one of the pairs was ripped from the back & it's not cheap to have that defect
5,Walking on clouds,"I really dont understand why everyone likes these, not very pretty, I got these for my daughter ""she had to have them"", when they came in she insisted I try them on, and I did,, its like walking on clouds and now I have to have a pair of my own."
4,Helped me!,"I have gastric reflux and had developed a sore throat. I thought I would give these a try after seeing a recomendation of Slippery Elm for throat and stomach discomfort on the Dr. Oz show. This Item has also helped with my dry mouth and I like the rose hips benefit of Vitamin C..My sore thoat is gone! I'm still on prilosec, but took that last one I had this morning..going to soon find out if my GERD is gone.."
4,An adequate survey...not much more.,"If you're interested in getting a quick run through the philosophy of the Hellenistic period, this would be an adequate primer. Probably best used to point the way to primary sources or more thorough scholarship. Designed as an introduction, it should not be faulted for often skimming difficult issues.If you have some philosophical background you will likely be able to identify the times when Sharples makes an assertion without much argumentation (again, since this is an introduction, I'm willing to overlook some of this). If this is your first exposure to the Hellenistic period, you may want to take some of his claims with a grain of salt.It's unlikely that there is another, more concise introduction to this period around, so this fills a need. If you're looking for deeper, more thorough scholarship on the period, then look elsewhere."
3,"boring, discordent","I didn't much care for this book. The famous chapters by topic sound simple enough but do cause some confusion--potent smatterings is the result in the main, which cannot hold my attention. If you are interested in Stoicism the most interesting comentary that I have found thus far is Sandbach's ""The Stoics""."
1,"Dull, Dull, Dull!!","After reading Mr. Lynch's other book, Carriers, and liking it (except for the totally implausable ending!) I was looking forward to Omega. Well got halfway thru it and gave up. Sorry, Mr. Lynch, but a couple of people dying from strep infections and hospital politics, makes for dull reading. Better luck next time."
4,A good page-turner and a quick read,"This is sort of a Ken Follett by-the-numbers thriller - which is not a bad thing in my opinion. Ken Follett develops characters that seem alive and somewhat believable, and this book is no exception.There are not many points for originality - the theme could fit into any Robin Cook novel although the writing is superior to anything of his I've read. Still, this is unfortunately not another career-defining book like ""Pillars of the Earth"" or ""World Without End"", but the main characters and the supporting cast draw the reader in and will make for a fast and exciting read on a cold wintry night.If you are new to Ken Follett, I would suggest starting with one of the two books mentioned above, however."
4,A great intro to the music of Mozart,"A great many young people like myself are interested in Classical music, but it can be daunting and confusing, what with all the versions out there! This album was my first classical buy, and it won me over! ""Overture to the Marriage of Figaro"" explodes, starting it all off with a bang. The album gradually softens, yet stays light and airy like a bubbling glass of champagne until wrapping up with a warm conclusion. listen to me! I sound like i was paid to do this! [ : ) Just give this a shot, especially if you know you like classical but aren't sure what to get!"
3,Good for what it is,"For what it is this is good. The screen is VERY small and the speakers.... just use headphones. The only real complaint i had is that if you have ANY kind of pressure on the screen (gravity included) when you close it, you get two little circles from the controller joysticks. I ended up putting a sock over the screen when I'm not using it and it worked good for me after that."
3,Slooooow Service,"I would have given this book five stars had it not taken two weeks to arrive! The book looks great, but it is only for the patient! Maybe that is why I ordered the book - to learn of the patience of Mr. Wesley! I hope the author tells me how quickly!"
4,This album is on point!!!!,"I was skeptical about purchasing this album since the only song I heard off of it was ""Jesus Muzik""....needless to say I was not dissapointed. The beats are on point and more importantly the lyrics are glorifying Christ 100%.The entire Reach fam is doing it big!"
2,the pro sucks for writing at an angle,I have long been a fan of Extra fine sharpies but this one has pro ink that doesn't write upside down or at an angle well. It does stay on marginally better. Get the regular ones. Ultra fine sharpies represent the vast majority of sharpies but the tips degrade easily. Get Extra fine.
2,Masonic History from an English Viewpoint,"R. A. Gilbert's introduction to this book is quite interesting, and well worth reading by itself. The present book reflects the viewpoint of a man who was interested in the 'lost continents' of Atlantis and Lemuria.It was said that pursuing an original printing of this book was what brought forth Mark Twain's famous comment concerning the rapid aging of the Masonic Fraternity, 'From both directions.'That being said, for someone interested in the history of Freemasonry, this book is a worthwhile addition to their library. It is particualrly beneficial that it is now available in an inexpensive edition. The older editions are too costly to be worth purchasing. While it should not be the first Masonic history purchased, it certianly may be used to provide some interesting background material to the Masonic scholar."
5,Fantastic,It is an incredible cd. My friend burned me a copy and i was skeptical of a band that i had never heard of. How wrong i was. Pound is truly amazing and i recommend any music lover buy this album.
4,Southern Comfort Food,"This is a classic regional cookbook filled with 50s and 60s home cooking favorites with a Southern accent. These are the recipes a whole generation in East Tennessee grew up with, familiar from Mom's kitchen and frequent church ""covered-dish"" dinners. The expression, ""It came out of Mary Starr"" is something you are still liable to hear in the Knoxville area."
4,A real page turner!,"SCANDALOUS AGAIN was a very good read! Madeline is a strong woman who does not realize that her strength stems from her fear of betrayal. Her father's unreliable behavior has left Madeline with a need to manage her life and the lives of everyone she comes in contact with. Gabriel realizes Madeline's need to be in control, but he has other goals to attain in addition to winning Madeline's trust. Here are two people who do love each other, but must overcome circumstances and events that threaten to keep them apart, permenantly.It would have been helpful to have a little more character development in some of the minor players and the villan. I would like to have known more about Madeline and Gabriel's initial relationship. Poor Eleanor was left ""hanging"" so to speak. Of course, that is another story, I suppose. Can't wait to read it!"
3,DISAPPOINTING,"I have to agree with the reviewer who wrote ""not up to par."" My sentiments exactly! Ms. Dodd writes about a couple who were romantically involved in the past and broke up. We meet up with them four years later. It just didn't work in this case. I think their earlier story would have been more interesting. The book ends with a strong suggestion of a sequel. Let's hope it's an improvement."
1,Boo!,"After reading this, I assumed that it was a reissue from those bad old days in the 80s when romance novelists apparently believed that abuse = love. There wasn't much romance here, and I found the relationship between the two main characters disturbing. Also, the plot was ludicrous. Fail.So, what on earth happened to Christina Dodd? I never thought she was one of the greats--her plots tend to be rather ludicrous. But I usually find her books entertaining, and I'm willing to suspend disbelief and just go along for the ride. In this one, there was no charm to distract me from the gaping plot holes. This one was just bad on every level."
5,Rodrigo and Pepe Romero,Pepe Romero's interpretation of the Rodrigo classic guitar concerto is outstanding. This album will definitely be a treasure for one's collection!
3,New battery,"Everyone knows that Macbook Pro battery life SUCKS. This battery replaced my previous, 6 month old battery that was managing 45 min on a full charge. Yep, pretty pathetic.Anyway, this one was cheap and works as well as it can. I expect it will need replacing in another 6 months, however the Apple store in SF was kind enough to replace the 45 min one - AFTER I bought this replacement."
2,not what i thought,"I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CAT IN ALABAMA WAS SAYING,THESE CATS ARE NOT THE SAME WITHOUT KEVIN A. BEHIND THEM.IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE THEY NEED A LITTLE MORE THAN JUST A RAP STYLE TO LAST IN THIS GAME.TO THOSE THINKING OF BUYING THIS CD TAKE HEED I LISTEN TO WHAT THEY DID SOME OF IT IS COOL,BUT TRUST ME THEY ARE HAVING IT HARD WITHOUT THERE PRODUCER PLAYA."
3,These boyz need to keep it CROOK,"I give much props to Mr.Pookie and Mr.Lucci, but manna they fell off a little. This album was to short, then need to go back to their old record label. Manne, their first albums were tight, but this was is aiight. When they do come wit a new one, I hope its better then My Life. HOLLA."
3,A Whole New Genre,"You've seen the dancing condom and other raunchy characters on the Barney/Sesame Street mockery of a music video for Bad Ronald's ""Let's Begin"". If you liked this song, then you should be satisfied with the remainder of the album, which can be be best described as an interesting clash between, say the poppy-hip-hop-melody/rap of LFO and the edginess of perhaps Eminem, though their lyrical content is not nearly as clever and original. Or better yet, if Everlast were to mix his song/rap to the tune of N'Sync beats, you'd have Bad Ronald. In fact, one of the rappers in this trio is a dead-ringer for Everlast. Songs like ""I Need Love"" and ""Hand on the Wheel"" stand out on a pretty decent album."
5,SheDaisy IS the Whole SheBang!,"SheDaisy is not only the best new country group, but they are also the best group of girls any music fan could ask for. Their CD is a definite must have. If you ever get a chance to meet these sisters or see a show ... DO IT!"
2,SheBust - This Is Teenage Girl Stuff,"This is not country music. Maybe they didn't think they could make it in the pop scene. The ladies have pleasant voices and the arrangements are ok. Well, actually all the songs sound alike, are a little whiney, and some sound like chants instead of singing. Yep, in A Night to Remember a man bites the dust just like the guys in Goodbye Earl and Independence Day. I know men don't like these kinds of songs, do women? What about these ladies serving some time for killing these guys?"
1,Is This Country?,"This sounds more like a male-bashing album, like Alanis Morrisette meets Shania Twain sound. True, this is the country-pop-sound that is hot right now, but that will fade like any fad. And, as a Christian, I don't like the idea of my ex-wife getting an idea from SheDaisy to send me off a cliff!"
4,They rock,"one sentence will describe this whole album: Kristyn, Kelsi and Kassidy are an amazing set of singers who can harmonize like no one else, and have a smashing debut to prove it!"
4,stars,"There are some decently big ones and smaller stars. It's a little sad that it's only stars, but I bought it knowing that. As stated in other reviews, don't use the puddy thing they provide. I think 135 stars is enough, I dont need a million to light up my room at night."
3,They glow,"I bought these to give a little more light to my boys' bedroom in hopes that they'd be willing to let me close their bedroom door at night. Depending on how long they are exposed to light, they'll glow for up to about half and hour or less. The dots that come with the stars work but we've had some of the stars fall off the ceiling. I'm not sure if they were ""helped"" along by my boys or not. I looked up star charts and put the stars up in various constellations on the ceiling and under the top bunk of our bunk beds. My boys like seeing the constellations and learning their names. The stars on the underside of the top bunk don't get enough light to glow much at all. Very fun, but they don't give enough light for my boys to be okay with their bedroom door closed."
3,"The stars at night... are sorta bright, but don't last long.","We've bought two types of stars from Amazon. These were OK, and they do stick well to the ceiling with the enclosed stickers, but they are dimmer than others we've bought and do not last long. They are exposed to both sunlight and a floor lamp in our son's room."
5,Great for the price,These gloves are excellent for the price. I work out 5 days a week & these gloves are comfortable & durable.
1,Good deal,I really like these gloves like others say the stitching doesn't last long. 10 min of hand stitching the wrist wrap more securely it made it well worth the price.Update: In may the stitchings started coming off of the fingers. After 2 weeks I had to restitch the wraps after 2 months all of the fingers have holes in the sides on the seem.I'm not doing anything crazy. Just normal workouts at the gym every other day.
3,"Nice features, but they don't last long","These would appear to be great for the price: leather, washable, wrist wraps-- all very impressive. The only problem is, if you frequent the gym like I do, they just don't last long enough. I use the gloves probably four days a week for an hour each day (I don't use wear them on leg days or when doing cardio), and probably wash them every three weeks, and let's just say they aren't the best stitched gloves. One pair I bought actually lasted me six months, but the replacement only made it to six months after I got my wife to sew up all the rips. On my third pair, they are not looking good after two months. These will do the job for light usage, but I'm going to treat myself and try to find something that lasts longer."
2,These gloves aren't very good,"I just got these gloves and the stitching is already falling apart. Additionally, they don't have enough padding- especially at the base of the fingers. I had the Valeo Ocelot gloves prior to buying this pair, and I was satisfied with those. I should have got them again."
1,poor quality gloves,"I bought this product at a store before and it served me very well for two years. I hoped to replace it and so came to amazon. Excitedly I went to the gym for working out after receiving my gloves. I was sorely disappointed. I got blisters at the end of the week. I had to buy a new gloves that now works fine. I was very saddened. The quality of the product was not as advertised, the material was not the leather advertised, the length of the fingers were shorter than advertised."
1,Arrived torn.,"Just got my gloves. The seam that holds the wrist wrap to the left glove is torn. Explored returning them, but Amazon won't send the next pair until these ones get back to their facility. Wait three weeks for gloves that work, or workout in torn gloves? Thanks for the plethora of choices, Amazon!"
2,Apariencia vs Calidad,"Cuando ves estos guantes piensas en comodidad y versatilidad para hacer los levantamientos de pesas, pero lo que tambien tienes en mente es que son de cierta calidad. Lamentablemente al 3er dia de uso ya tenia uno de los sugetadores de las muñecas roto. No lo puedo creer, y eso, que soy principiante y no levanto casi nada de peso.Decepcionado"
2,"Looked good, felt great...but","What seemed like a pretty good idea is what will ultimately cause a huge problem with these gloves. The strip of cotton material along the thumb which serves as a sweat absorber, after barely TWO months of use , started to separate at the seam where this material connects to the leather. This happened on each thumb within a few days of each other, although the rest of the glove appears that it may hold up pretty well, but one can't really lift comfortably with exposed thumbs. Now I do work out often, about four days a week and lift some pretty heavy weight, so maybe it's just that these gloves are better suited for lighter workouts without so much heavy pushing and pulling. Hope this helps!"
2,Not Great,"The leather on these gloves feels like plastic and the thumb portion doesn't extend far enough to protect your skin on the inside of your thumb - a spot that needs covering whenever you grip something. Overall, I am not satisfied with these gloves."
4,Nice but run big,"I gave these 4 stars because of the size. The quality is decent. I'm 5'6 and have average to slightly small hands for my height, but these glove are definitely loose but wearable. When concentrating on lifting weights i am detracted so i don't really notice it, but I measured my hands for the sizing guide and it said xs was 6-7 inches across below the knuckles. Anyway, my measurement was a solid 7 so i almost ordered a size up and glad i didn't. I like a more snug fitting glove and these have creases and wrinkles when i wear them and the fingers are loose, but for $10 I'm not sending them back. Next time i will buy exclusively a woman's glove."
3,Wagner: Tristan und Isolde,"Excellent performance. I do not like how the sound is recorded for these DVDs as when the music is soft I cannot hear it, but I can hear it when it is normal singing."
4,Unavailable in NZ items,"I actually managed to order the wrong reel for a friend but when it got here it was so lovely to use I kept it for myself, the smooth winding of a penn reel compared with what we can get in Nz for that price the shipping charge was minimal and it arrived several days a head of schedule, really happy."
3,Card file box,The quality was less than I expected for 20.00. There were dents in the lid and the metal was quite thin.
3,Not a single-sheet cover - more like a clear file folder,"I was looking for a single sheet cover so I could print my daily schedule and carry it around. These are large enough to carry a dozen sheets of paper, and are larger than a single sheet so it's more like carrying a clear file folder with closed edges.For that purpose they are OK, but not great because they are too flimsy to use with multiple sheets for long."
1,Don't bother unless your child is afraid of the attic,"What a disappointment this book was. My daughter is three years old and will only let me read her a caillou book before bed. I purchased this one along with several others.The story is about the fact that Caillou is afraid to go into the attic because he thinks there is a wolf there. My daughter would never think to be afraid of something like that, but this book put that idea into her head.This book is definately only for those folks who are trying to help a child deal with a phobia. Bottom line: Don't bother with this one unless you want to give your child nightmares."
2,extra-lean offerings,"After reviewing the book and listening to the CD,I would not buythis book again.The CD is short in duration and demonsrates onlya few examples in the book.The material is consistent with otherbooks on the subject but more recorded examples are needed inorder for a beginning-level student to grasp the concepts.Thereare some short sections on the Bongo,Timbales and Djembe but onlya extra-lean portion so don't waste your money!"
5,Sold Out,Great teenage stories that draw students to want to read the book. I can't keep the series of books in my classroom. As soon as it's checked in it's checked out by someone else.
5,Wicked Wicked Cool,"This album is one of the best that I have bought in a while. It is sooooooooooo good. He is so amazing and if you don't have this album yet, what are you waiting for??? Go get it! You will love it!"
3,Christian version of Bon Jovi,"The best this album has to offer is the fact the guitar is played by Rex Carroll (Whitecross, King James) who recorded as a favor. I'd have to say however, I only like half the songs. I believe that ""Forgotten Child"" is the best song. The vocals and style of the songs is very similar to Bon Jovi. The Cd came out in 1994 after Rex Carroll left Whitecross to persure other musical endevours since Scott Winzel decided it be better to make a stlye change.My interest in this album is mostly (close to only) due to the fact Rex Carroll is on the album. (Rex is my favorite guitarist)I hate to rate anything Rex is on lower than 5 stars, but I must this time.A much better buy for 80's hard rock is a band Rex Carroll was in before Whitecross called ""Fierce Heart"" they are like a blend of 'Foreigner' and 'Scorpions' it is for sell on Amazon and Ebay (Rex's guitar work is the same as in Whitecross, with 'Eden' it is differrent)"
3,Minimal Copying Capabilities,"I bought this software because I had a previous version which worked fine, but this version didn't meet my needs. With the latest DVD's there are new encrytions and this software has many limitations. I was only able to back up 1 out of 4 discs which is a horrible percentage. There are much better programs available that does a much better job."
2,Dang!,"Not a fine point at all. Misleading packagingand description. Its your average Sharpie, witha fattish point."
3,Is ok but cable gets caught,"Once I got the cable unwound it worked great. There is a gap between the end wall and the plate that prevents the cable from unwinding more than it has to and when the cable is unwound the cable tends to get caught in between this gap and then you need to use a screwdriver to loosen it from this trap. There is no reason for the gap to be there. The plate could have been just over another 1/8"" and there would have been no problem but because of this and the non-existent instructions it will only receive 3 stars."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"THIS PROGRAM IS TERRIBLE...ON TRYING TO BURN VIDEO DVD'S IT HAS NO SOUND OR IF IT DOES IT SOUNDS LIKE THE ""CHIPMUNKS"".ON SOME MP3 FILES AGAIN IT'S LIKE HAVING THE ""CHIPMUNKS"" AT YOUR COMPUTER.TECHINAL SUPPORT...HA HA HA...NO HELP...SAVE YOUR MONEY OR INVEST IN ANOTHER PROGRAM........"
1,Gioachino rossini songs of love,My mistake. I didn't rad the label carefully enough. I thought the artist was a tenor.
2,Stephen Hawking,I don't remember that the description of the book said that the book had several library stamps on the inside front cover and back cover. I was disappointed since we were giving this as a gift.
3,Answering Machine Solution,This is a very odd experimental album of 66 bizarre and sometimes funny contrived answering machine intros to leave a message.Not really music to listen to in sequence but a funny CD to put on and play a few tracks here and there
4,Redemption and Hope,"I thought this family movie was really good. It is basically about an older woman of faith reaching out to a teenager in trouble. Her gentle compassion touches and changes him. I thought all the actors and actresses were perfectly cast - they all did a wonderful job. Aside from a few cuss words (which she gently discourages), this is a great movie for families and children. I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Walking Across Egypt,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie after reading the book. The book is absolutely wonderful. The movie came across to me as slow and not near as entertaining as the book at all. I would reccommend it if you haven't read the book, but if you have, you may be disappointed witht the quality of the movie."
5,Great Cameral!,"This camera is excellent. I cannot believe the quality of the images. I bought it because I especially wanted to use it for close up shots - and they turned out much better than I expected. The camera is a great size, easy to learn and control, has almost no noticable shutter lag, and takes great shots. The battery life is not the best, but I like that the battery is removable and extra batteries are cheap. All-in-all I'm very glad that I bought this."
1,Bad,"Goods of state that broke down were delivered and send, and translated several times but abandoned in wastebasket by use incapability.ON-OFF function is very poor."
4,Good value for the price,"I agree with an earlier review that the magnet could be stronger, but it does the job and... It's a REFRIGERATOR magnet, not a car emblem (which I also purchased for my vehicle). Love this little bugger."
5,"Great office ""partner""","As a solo general surgeon just out of residency, I have found this text very helpful in constructing DDx and planning Tx. And, with no GI doc in town, I've found myself handling work-ups that they generally would handle such as chronic diarrhea, dysphagia or IBS. It helps me quickly and efficiently find an answer to a problem patient, whether it be in the office or after an EGD or colonoscopy that reveals unexpected/unfamiliar findings."
5,"Excellent Tool, Excellent Business","My order arrived very promptly, however it was filled incorrectly. Stuff happens. Chapman bent over backward to make things right and did so virtually immediately. I would look forward to doing business with them again."
3,The best was Sonia Braga,"Idea is good, actors are wonderful, bad ending though. I really don't understand why, everything could have worked to a very good movie, but something missed. Anyway, Sonia Braga is wonderful wherever she appears, Sex and the City as the lesbian, or Tieta, a Brazilian movie where she shows her true self."
3,Ho HUmm,"Although the photo and the packaging promise much, there's not enough testosterone in this vid to move me. The two lead actors both have great bods and would be more of an asset to the movie if they would show more of themselves. The story line is only so-so. It held my attention in terms of anticipation, but the expectation was never met!"
3,Aaah those Argentines..,"I kinda liked Testosterone. Wonderful setting, cool graphics, and great acting - especially Sabato and Font impressed me. However, it has a flat feel to it, and the script could be tighter. The lost American in a foreign country was well depicted, even though I lacked the intensity that was needed in Sutcliffe's growing obsession. He just looked cute to me - no offense.The ending is quite confusing, and the alternate one in the deleted scenes is really bent (refreshingly so), but all in all, a solid 3 stars."
4,The true meaning behind hypnosis,"I have two science degrees and I am now studying hypnotherapy. I discovered hypnotherapy while I was going through grief and found it to be extremely powerful in healing the emotional pain. I have been guided into hypnosis many times and have learnt a lot from the process.During hypnosis nobody controls your mind. It's not voo doo or magic!! and you don't become unconscious. Hypnosis is a beautiful state your mind reaches where it can be relaxing and highly focussed. In hypnotherapy, hypnosis is induced by the therapist to help you heal (emotionally and or physically).After coming across several hypnosis/NLP/mind books, I highly recommend this book. It diffuses some of the common misconceptions about hypnosis and it gives a helpful guide into using hypnosis more effectively in therapy. The other book I also recommend by everyone who wants to know about hypnosis is ""Hypnotherapy"" by Dave Elman"
4,Inspiring,"This was very inspiring. Miller really has his ducks in a row & knows what is important in this world--and unfortunately it isn't what the majority of us are focusing on. The Earth, the energy contained therein, and joining together to do what is right--that is important. This was a very inspiring purchase."
5,Great end to a great game.,This may be the last Wriath book and if it is then the series is ending with one of the best sourcebooks ever written. Keep up the great work Bruce!
3,"harsh on ""petites""; good for a total style novice","What compelled me to write this is irritation at how petite sizes are dealt with in this book. They are cheerleaders for tall women (of ""grand scale""-- give me a break) and say nothing short of insulting to non-tall (normal or petite) women. The phrasing is all about how to mask your shortness handicap. I thought this book was supposed to help women work with their natural qualities..."
2,Don't Bother,"A book of this sort is a good idea. Unfortunately, the author is not only not a philosopher, but apparently spent so much effort on trying to be humerous, that there wasn't much left for accuracy. In this supposed introduction to the great thinkers we find such gems as Ayn Rand advocating ""egotism"" rather than ""egoism"" (a distinction Rand was at pains to make in The Virtue of Selfishness), the term ""dogma"" defined as a belief enforced in an ""authoritarian manner,"" (perhaps a popular connotation of the word is everyday speech, but not its proper definition as a theological term), and, stunningly, feminist writer Mary Godwin Wolstencraft being credited with authoring the novel Frankenstein (no mean feat since she died a decade before it was written in 1813. The actual author is , of course, Mary Wolstencraft Shelly who was a live teenager in 1813).The list goes on. This is a sloppy book, inaccurate, poorly edited, and of no use as an introduction to the subject. Don't bother."
2,"I'd say, 2.5 stars","I bought this book on the strength of the two five-star reviews. Well...it's not a bad book, but superlative? memorable? moving? (which is what I rate 5-stars in my reviews): I don't think so! It definitely WANTED to be, but it's got a somewhat confusing story line with way too many different conflicts going on. There was the heroine's trying to keep her brother safe; the hero's conflict over whether he should love her or deliver her to the King; the hero's family problems; the heroine's skeevy uncle & his plots; the heroine's Scottish family...yada yada, and none of this gelled into something really attention-grabbing.The heroine, Gabby (terrible name) was just ""nice"", no spice...tho' everyone kept saying how brave & resourceful she is, I just didn't feel it. The heroine's having ""the Sight"" was over-used. The love story was vaguely boring, I thought. I just had to push myself to finish it. Sorry, but this is no more memorable than any average Harlequin-style, historical romance."
1,The camera is great WHILE UNDER WARRANTY,The camrea worked great until the warranty expired. Had it fixed and in four monthe it is out again.There is a web site somewhere about all of the complaints.Just bought a Cannon.
4,"Great Episode of a Sublime, Though Sadly Forgotten, TV Show","True fans of Horror who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s love this show. Even Stephen King, in his book DANSE MACABRE (p. 216 of the oversized paperback), calls this ""the best horror series ever put on TV."" The show's host, Boris Karloff, was obviously no stranger to the genre, and he even starred in several notable episodes.This particular episode, ""Masquerade,"" is one of the tamer episodes horror-wise, but it still sets the creepy mood that was the trademark of the series. Also notable are pre-fame performances by Tom Poston and Elizabeth Montgomery, as well as a nice little turn by John Carradine. Unlike the majority of THRILLER episodes, it does contain humor and has a humorous twist ending that, by today's standards, probably seems a bit cliche. Nontheless, it is a very entertaining episode and well worth a watch."
1,HARD TO UNDERSTAND FOR THE NEW ORISHA INITIATE,"SO MUCH YORUBA VERSES, VERY DIZZY TO READ, SMALL LETTERS WITH YORUBA VERSES THAT DONT MAKE SENSE, HARD TO UNDERSTAND NO DETAILS FOR NEW INITIATE I DONT RECCOMMEND THIS BOOK"
4,CUTE LITTLE CUBBYHOUSE,"This Australian/American co-production was called CUBBYHOUSE in its Australian release, but since many Americans would never know what a cubbyhouse is, HELLION became its American title. At times cheesy and implausible, HELLION nevertheless has a few jolting moments, some videogame like effects and maintains an eerie atmospheric tension. Joshua Leonard (Blair Witch Project) plays the cocky, yet sometimes sensitive, teenager who finds himself in Australia when his mom divorces his dad and wants to start over in her homeland. They buy a rather rundown house, which happens to be the site of a murder by a deranged devil worshiper, who killed his brother's children, and is now festering in an insane asylum. The cubbyhouse (we'd call it a playhouse) is possessed by demonic forces out to possess the two children.There's not a lot of originality in the movie, although the concept of the killer vines is fun. For a lower budget film, HELLION is entertaining."
2,Hellion: devil's playground / Cubbyhouse,"This did not live up to my expectations it could have been better, the characters were not very convencing, I found it odd to have such a raggedy house in a upper middle class neighborhood. You would think the family would too.The beginning was good, but like most horror film's loses steam after the first 15 minites, I also never known anyoneto perform an exorcism on there own, like Joshua Leonard as the eldest son who was reluctent to move to Australia. And naturaly the cursed cubbyhouse is still alive, after it's destroyed it pull's itself back together on it's ownto terrorize the next unsuspecting family."
2,Poor quality.,"My Telescopic Bypass Lopper arrived today. When you extend the handles, it's supposed to ""click"" into place at several different points and then remain stationary. But the ""clickers"" don't hold. Might still be usable, but certainly not high quality."
3,Stand Not Included,"You need to be aware that you are purchasing the table-top only. If you think you are getting the stand (pictured) as part of this purchase, you will be disappointed. You must purchase the stand separately. On the MLCS web-page, they show several different stands available. The one pictured here sells for about $50. Another thing I did not like is having to drill and counter-sink the holes for mounting your router. This takes some precision work and you may not feel you can do this properly. If you don't mind a table top model then the ""Bench Dog 40-001 ProTop Contractor Benchtop Router Table"" is a solidly built unit. The box is constructed from a sturdy plywood and is nicely finished. Most of the others I looked at were made of ""particle board"" which chips fairly easily. The mounting holes are pre-drilled and will fit most any router. Assembly is easy enough for the novice. Overall if you can live with a table-top router table this Bench Dog, in my opinion, is the way to go."
5,Valuable Information : a must have for all teachers of yoga and practitioners,"This dvd is the real thing. For anyone who is looking to better understand how your body works this is it. I have read through a lot of boring anatomy books and seen a fes dvds. This one really gives me valuable information. It changed the way i look at my yoga practice, because I can better understand how my body works. The chapter on connective tissue is amazing. I am a better teacher and a more informed yoga practitioner becasue of it. I highly recommend it!"
4,The KB28 Camera by Kodak,"this camera is really useful, and cheap for someone who is prone to losing cameras like myself. it works well, has a manual rewind button you can press if u don't want to use the whole role, and it automatically advances to the next picture so you don't miss one."
4,very good movie,--note it is subtitledso expect to read the story but it is a story all Catholics should watch or share with others
5,Amazing movie,"An amazing movie on the life of an amazing priest. A must see for all! I was so enthralled by his story, the 3 hour movie felt like 20 minutes. Wonderful!!!*****"
4,Nice Collectible!,The key has really nice color and is printed on both sides. Really nice collectible to have. Great for the Eeyore fan!
2,a mediocre book,"unfortunately, this book is essentially Islamic propaganda : it attempts to demonstrate that the Bible is a corrupted man-made message, while the Quran is the unadulterated word of God.What's worse, Mr Asadi believes that he has entirely succeeded in thisstill, it is of somehow higher level than the usual dawaganda (such as Zakir Naik, Hamza Tzortis etc)for this reason, mainly, I will give it an extra second star"
3,Recording quality marginal,"Although the instrumental performances on this CD are most competent, the recording is very marginal. It obviously has been recorded using old technology and suffers from artificial electronic compression. The result is a very limited dynamic range and an almost tinny, recorded-at-a-distance sound. It lacks acoustic depth and ""presence."" Upon listening to this CD, one can easily discern that it is a recording rather than something heard at a live performance. This 2-CD package certainly gives you a ""bargain"" in terms of quantity of selections, but do not expect high-quality sound."
1,Didn't work enough to even blow out a candle,"The motor is so weak that it's impossible to blow these things up, not to mention that it's not an actual massager, but just a big balloon around your leg that inflates then deflates...so there's no massaging, just squeezing..."
5,Magnificent!,"Constance O'Day Flannery had me hooked with Timeless Passion. She just totally enraptured me with the way she tells her story to make you think that you are right there. She adds bits of history, some romance, time travel and enough questions to keep you on the edge of your seat. She is absolutely my favorite author!!!"
5,What I think of the VMU,"I think that the Dreamcast VMU is a really awsome item. Although the controller of a Dreamcast does not have as many buttons as a Playstation, the VMU makes the controller a much more pleasant sight. not only does the controller have good grip but that screan is excelent. The screan is very clear and the possibilities are plentiful. Not only is it a memory card, but it is a speaker and screan for the controller, and an independant game. I have had alot of fun with the Sonic Choa Adventure game and the Soul Calibur game pack is fun too. I myself have 5 of these VMU's. 1 white, 1 charchoal, 1 red, and 2 blue. I am so supprised they are free with some games at EB right now. I do not know how the Dreamcast could not have done better in the market. It was truely a system i will own for years to come! It has the best memory cards and good solid graphics and i appreciate the mechanics and genious of it very much. THANK YOU SEGA!"
5,"Not educational, but a lot of fun!","OK, maybe a bit educational (of Star Wars knowledege). I hate Magic, never really wanted to get into something that complicated. This Star Wars game is easy, fun, and quick to learn. Plus, IT'S STAR WARS!!! Never thought I would enjoy a card game, but I do now."
1,This is why I don't like Star Trek books!,"It is bad enough that most of the 79 episodes of Star Trek focused primarily on Kirk and Spock. That is my main #1 beef against the original TV series. Authors who repeat and magnify that blunder make the matter worse!Once again, Kirk and Spock (mostly Spock) are the main focus of attention, with the rest of the Enterprise crew functioning as no more than glorified pages and squires. Even worse is the way Spock is charcaterized by the authors. In this book, Spock might just as well be wearing a cape with a red ""S"" on it!I read this book before ST:TNG, ST:DS9, and Voyager were made, and I despised this book then. After enjoying the way ALL of the characters were included and developed in the three latest Star Trek series, both my love of Star Trek and my hatred of this book grew. Enough, already!"
2,The pits,"I've decided that this book is worth two stars... why? Well, I must say that it is the absolute worst of the Star Trek novels I've read. It was difficult to understand and the plot was a bit obscure. Also, it seemed to me that Spock and Kirk were portrayed as homosexuals. I began to wonder whether or not this was a story based on sexual fanasties(as a previous reviewer stated). I did, however like the fact that the character of the Romulan Commander was reintroduced. All in all the book was creative yet poorly written. I will not buy the sequel."
2,Not so great!,"I wouldn't bother with buying this dictionary- sure, it's cute but it doesn't have a lot of words! The bigger version is better."
1,Not a good buy!,"I am very disappointed in this camera. I have had it for two years and have yet to get good quality pictures from it. The color is very bland and does not adapt well in different lights. I am recently having problems with the advantix portion of the camera, it doesn't adapt to the settings I choose. I would look at other cameras before this one. I am looking for a different one."
3,"Good book, but needs to be updated","This book is a wealth of information, but it desperately needs an update. It was published nearly 15 years ago, when the most powerful microwave was 700 watts. Now with 1000, 1100, and even 1200 watt microwaves being the norm, her recipes all need to be adjusted and updated. Also, there are a whole slew of new utensils - like browning dishes - that could be addressed."
2,not a good buy,"My son recieved this as a gift and it has never been played with. It tips over too easy and does nothing. My son is almost a year old and my daughter is 3, neither one plays with this toy. It is cute but a waste of money."
3,ok,toy is cute but harldy keeps my 1 year old daughter attention for to long. requires batteries but bee noes not move on its on you have to move it then it makes a sound waste of good batteries
3,Buzz about headaches!!!!,"I bought this for my son when he was 7 months old for an Easter present, he likes it in a way, he loves the spinning bee, that is all he mostly plays with on the toy. I think it is meant for a little bit older kids. The thing that is really bad about this toy is that my son will be grabbing the buzzing bee and pull it over on himself. He is constantly hitting his head, they should have made this toy heavy on the bottom. He hasen't been hurt bad or anything but it has caused him to cry a few times. Other than that the toy is ok right now, he will probably like it more when he is walking and can put the mail in the slot and take it out without getting smashed in the head."
4,Great toy idea but should be redesigned,My 12 month old got this for her birthday. I was really wanting her to have this product. She loved playing with a smaller mailbox that was on one of her other toys so I thought she would really enjoy it. She loves getting the mail in and out of it and she likes playing with the containers that stack inside each other on the base. There is only one fault...it tips over very easily. So whenever she opens the door on the mailbox it falls over on her. They should have made the base weighted especially since its for the toddler age group.
2,"Fun toy??? Yeah, right!","Bought this toy and returned it the next day. First of all it comes with LOTS of screws, annoying bee and not sturdy at all. After I put it together it fell on my daughter's head! Looks real nice in the picture, but once you open it you'll probably regret buying it. All you have to do is lightly touch the mailbox and it will tip over. So, the stand doesn't hold the mailbox, which is not light by the way,you need a drill gun to put it together(tried the screw driver and it took forever to screw in 1 screw) and the bee has a vibrating sound that after 5 min of hearing it you want to throw the whole thing out the window. It is not worth the money or the effort."
2,CUTE BUT NOTHING TO IT,got this toy for my now 2 year old and its cute but it does NOTHING. I have a 3 year old and a 2 year old and they both would play with any toy but this one.
1,Both tadpoles DEAD and NEVER turned in to FROGS!! SO disappointing!!!!,"Wow, what a terrible terrible product! The wait to receive the frogs wasn't too bad - about 10 weeks, but we had them for three months and NOTHING happened! Changed the water & fed as directed but they stayed tadpoles. Then one started swimming upside down and doing twirlies so we figured he was probably a goner. He died two days later. Our other tadpole survived about one more week and died after doing the crazy twirlies too. My daughter is REALLY disappointed and we do not recommend this to anyone!As someone else stated, if I could give it 0 stars, I would!I guess we are off to buy some fish......"
2,Waste of Money,What a waste of money. (I did not order it from amazon though). The tadpoles took forever to come in the mail. They finally arrived (in November where it is freezing cold here). Its been two months and the tadpoles are still tadpoles. I very much doubt they will ever turn into frogs. The habitat was made of very flimsy plastic. Im very surprised we had no leaks. I was overall very disappointed in this item and would not recommend it.
2,flimsy,"The picture looks really cool and from afar it does appear really cool. However, had I known how flimsy and cheaply made this product was I would have spent a little more and bought a glass terrium. The price should be half of what they charge."
1,ordered tadpoles in Jan 2011--still waiting,"We ordered the tadpoles from Uncle Milton that are to go with the tank in January 2011. We called them in the spring when they still hadn't come, then called them a couple times in the summer, then fall. It is the middle of October (it's been 9 months). They still haven't sent any. They claimed they were going to send them, but it was too cold, too hot, all the tadpoles had already turned into frogs, and that they were looking for a different supplier. No one ever contacted us. We initiated all contact. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I will never buy another product from this company.When I asked for a refund for the habitat, because who needs a habitat with no frogs....they refused."
1,Tadpole didn't live,"I found this frog kit on clearance at my local store and bought it for my son. The directions were a little hard to follow and had a major mistake in them (about how much water to put in when initially introducing the tadpole to the environment). It took about 3 months to get our tad pole, and even though we followed the directions as closely as we could, the tadpole lived only a week. Definitely a waste of money."
4,fun and education,My 6 year old is very interested in animal and plant cycles. She saw ad advert for this toy in a catalog and saved her money for weeks to order this toy.So far she is extremely pleased with it! We read many of the reviews before deciding to purchase it. We also decided to order tadpoles from a separate site because the shipping time was faster that way.
2,"Well, It looks nice.","I recieved this as a gift for Christmas. I was very excited. It looked like the best habitat ever. When I opened it to prepare it I found that it was very flimsy.The top was just a plastic box fitting top and can be easily knoked off. That's exactly what happened too. My cat (who has no claws) just lifted the top off and proceded to chase my amphibians around. I'm not sure if the habitat was big enough for my frog either. He always seemed crowded and usually spent his time pawing at the walls. I'm not ungrateful to have had the chance to watch my frog's metamorphosis. But, I did change his cage to a sturdier and roomier one soon after my frogs encounter with Beast."
3,"Very cheaply made, flimsy plastic","This entire habitat is made of very flimsy plastic. It isn't the hard plastic that I had thought it would be. It is really soft & very cheaply made.We got our tadpole rather quickly, less than two weeks. This was a Christmas present for my six year old & he absolutely loves his new pet. I just wish it was made a little better.Editing*** the tadpole FINALLY changed into a frog & then promptly died. My son was heartbroken."
1,DEATHTRAP,"We received our tadpoles in late December- after a 3 month wait- and we thought we were pretty lucky when after only another 2 months of feeding and cleaning- one tadpole turned into a frog- ONLY TO DIE THE SAME DAY!! I speculate that it somehow drowned. In retrospect, I now remember seeing it struggling to get out of the water- the edged of the water section are steep and slippery. So, he went belly up on our most exciting day. It was DEVESTATING to my kids who have been waiting for 6 months to see a frog. This product should definitely be taken off the market!"
5,A Poetic Rythym,"""Please Tell Me If The Grass Is Greener"" is a beautifully written collection of short stories, written with a poetic twist. Joylynn focuses on issues that are real, and brings about valid points, while allowing the reader to ""feel"" her every word. I highly anticipate reading more from this fresh new voice in the writing community."
4,Interesting and fairly easy to understand,This book was required reading for one of my college classes. It proved to be interesting and not terribly difficult to read.
5,The title alone grabs us and helps us get on the right path,"The concept that we don't need to seek love, because we are love, is life-altering in a profoundly positive way. What a lovely world this would be if each person got that basic fact! Highly recommend this book! Audio of any of Byron Katie's works are also valuable as you get the visceral experience of her voice in addition to the concepts."
5,Excellent,"This, along with Byron Katie's other book, Loving What Is, have definitely changed my life forever. I also highly recommend reading A Thousand Names for Joy by Byron Katie, and The Power of Now and A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle. They are very compatible."
3,"Good, but her other book Loving What Is says it better","Byron Katie is one of the top and most profound authors of our time. Takes ancient truths and updates them for the Homer Simpson American mental condition we now find ourselves in so deeply. I also like the way she makes the concepts of EST very free flowing and accessible in her writings. Having said that, I felt this book was kind of weak compared to her other works. Nothing wrong with repetition, but I really feel her book, ""Loving What Is"" is a much better book. So if you are only going to read one Byron Katie book, read that one. If you have more time, than by all means read this and her other books, but don't expect them to be as good as Loving What IS- a true classic. And to Jane Roberts, this buds for you."
5,"Works great, looks snazzy too","Works great as as a memory card, but more importantly (since I already have a few) it adds a little spruce to the dreamcast (along with a blue controller and a custom smoke console shell). Now it doesn't look so out of date in my entertainment center."
4,very good product,"this a great product and it works perfectly, thank you. Also, the delivery was extremely fast!"
3,Kindle Version does not include necessary support for this book,"The printed version of ""The Art of Fugue"" includes a CD of the music analyzed in the text. While a reader can supplement the Kindle from her/his own collection, you should be aware that the writer assumes that (a) you have the CD and (b) you have the sheet music for the pieces focused on.Pat"
2,"Alas, an Apt Title","Did he listen to these tapes before releasing them?Marshall Crenshaw has an ear like no one else -- for the pop hook, the unforgettable guitar lick, the surprising chord change, the addictive chorus. His brilliant studio albums over the past 20 years haven't received anywhere near the notice they deserve. Nor have there been enough of them -- I guess that explains why so many of us snatch up anything he releases!However, this one won't get a second listen. (Okay, maybe a second, but no THIRDS!)The songs are great but pale in comparison to the studio originals. The playing and singing are sloppy and reveal nothing new. The sound and arrangements are surprisingly amateurish coming from someone with such meticulous studio standards (and amazing studio technique!) And shy guy that he is, the onstage patter is limited and predictable.By all means, support this guy by buying his complete studio catalog - but you can safely skip this one."
3,Incomprehensive Text,"This book is being used as a course book of st. of materials in n.e.d. university but the great insufficiency of this book is about its text,which on many ocassions remains a mystery.one particular aspect which i would like to enlighten is about chapter 11 and the topic is the buckling phenomena which is particularly ill-explained.Ihope my review would be given due consideration."
3,Good for price...However...,"For the price, this is a pretty good camera. Extremely light, and has great options like the 3 picture options(C,P,H); and a good 2x zoom. However, I have found that in low light situations the flash tends to ""white-out"" people, and it's also not very sharp (tends to be blurry). Bright light (most outdoor) turns-the sky-washed out. Most pictures turn out OK, but I've had a bunch of blurry landscapes and problems with night/indoor scenes."
3,Truly Testifyin',"So here I am truly testifyin' about this book. I didn't think it was bad- but I didn't think it was awesome either. I bought it because the cover looked interesting. And I thought it was ok. But as always, in every book there is much little bits of FYI that usually can come in handy later on in life. I also do give credit to the authors of this book because I am trying to become better with my writing skills and I really do praise him though on his use of words and form."
1,Pebbled glass top surface poor for cutting,"Purchased this direct from New World Kitchen for around $15. It is made of tempered glass with a pebbled top surface which is horrid for chopping on. You can't flip it over as bottom side is painted with some white coating and has feet. Good for counter protector or a protector for the top of the microwave, but is a lousy cutting board. I had hoped it was one of the old corning cutting boards, made from the smooth white corning material - my parents had one years ago and it was great - sadly, not the case and apparently those old cutting boards are no longer available. Bottom line, don't waste your money."
2,Not the best toy out there,"We got this for my daughter last Christmas, when she was 16 months old. She did enjoy putting the balls in the basket and watching them spin down, but the bat/golf club were completely useless. She never did do anything with the attached balls except sometimes spin them with her hand. Plus, this toy takes up a fair amount of space for what it is. I would say, skip this one and keep looking!"
2,3-in-1 Sport Set,"I think the manufacturer of this toy tried to cram too much into one toy. The 3-in-1 sports design doesnt really work. My son really liked the basketball hoop part when we first received the toy as a gift so we decided to keep it, well, after putting the darn thing together which was a pain, we werent going to return it. But, the novelty of the basketball part wore off quickly. With only 3 balls included my son resorted to throwing other things in the hoop and down the chute when he couldnt find the balls. It has become quite the annoyance now. The positioning of the golf ball and baseball make it very awkward to play either sport. Plus, who gives a young child a bat (allbeit a plastic one) in the house?! If it werent winter when we received this toy it would have been an outdoor only toy. Save your money and buy a nicer basketball hoop or a set of nice toddler golf clubs for your child rather than this toy."
2,the worst!!!!!!,"no no no it's the worst album by clan of xymox, j know Ronny from '85 and this album it's so bored,without soul and his voice don't come out like he knows.Usually he does songs subgestives originally,but in this album is all so empty.j hope that he will come back to do something special."
5,Seems to work.,"I do a lot of Krav Maga and various martial arts which by nature have periods of intense stress. It's always bothered me knowing that a corresponding raise in catabolic cortisol levels is the price one pays for that. Phosphatidylserine has been shown to keep cortisol levels low, effectively mitigating this. I've noticed a drop in overall stress levels and more focus during ""stress drills"" and the like. Traditionally Phosphatidylserine is pretty expensive but the Nature's Way product seems to be one of the more cost effective ones."
5,Execellant motivator and feel good book.,I purchased this book when I went on a diet one year ago.The book contains excepts from interviews of people who haveactually lost weight and KEPT it off. I found this to beextremely motivational. It help me to see that I could make aa change in my life that would actually last. The authorteaches you skills to make weight loss a life change.No more yo-yo diets; it is all about long term change. I canhappily reoprt that I lost 100 pounds in that year and readthe book four times...cover to cover! I still refer to itduring moments of weakness. It is really a self esteembooster.
2,Arrived broken,This product was pretty and couldn't wait to get it. Upon opening the box the back of the drawers was broken at first I just let it go because it was in the back. Putting it together was a pain in the butt! The holes were too big for the dowels and I had to use wood glue to keep it in. The wood drawer piece fell apart. It is not at all worth the price for this horrible vanity. Save your money for something better!
3,This company stinks ...,"The furniture is a nice piece for the money. But it arrived damaged, and trying to get replacment parts is crazy. They have live chat which is never on, their phone lines are jammed, and when you do get thru nobody's there to take your call. I emailed them and they say they will get back to you in so many days it's more like so many weeks. The merchandise is ok but if you have to deal with the company, good luck !"
3,Beautfiful but no instructions,I love the set but I received no written instructions. It's been weeks and there hasn't been a response with any help. I would hesitate to by from this company again if they can't help a paying customer with assembly instructions. The vanity set is useless to me at this moment.
4,Model GTG,"Arrived expeditiously, product as described. Ordered late Friday evening, arrived by Tuesday afternoon. Using the model as static display for awards and going away gift. A lot cheaper than buying a premade award."
1,Bow wow!,"What can I say? The ""true believers"" and the people who are desperate will believe in anything. But I do plan to give my dog (if I didn't have only a cat) ""1 caplet 3 times per day with 8 ounces of water or juice"" of Jordan's Primal Defense snake oil. On the web site it states ""Great for pets."" If it's good enough for Fido, it's good enough for me. But does it have to cost two arms and two legs. As for the ""book"", read it at your own risk."
4,Twisted sense of humor,"I really enjoyed this book. It was a light read, only took me a day to finish it but the story was very compelling and unique. I like this author's style of dark humor and sarcasm. It's interesting to see how he can change your view of a character from good to bad and back again. I would recommend this book!"
3,"Interesting concept, shocking, but fails to follow through","'Choke' is the first and only book I've read by Palahniuk. The concept was creative, and it held my attention throughout the book. However, Palahniuk seemed more interested in shocking the reader with gross descriptions than actual character development. Palahniuk only gives us hints on how and why Victor Mancini went from a bright med school student to a depraved sex maniac who earns a living off of sympathy checks from choking in restaurants. That would've been a more fulfilling story, but he only devotes one chapter at the end of the book to it. Choke is an interesting read, even if it is flawed."
2,don't listen to me,"I loved Fight Club and enjoyed Survivor. This one I did not care for. Too many lists of shocking facts, I felt like I was getting beaten over the head with a literary formula.But that's just my opinion. I could be wrong."
2,All these great reviews make me gag.,"It seems that many of the reviews for the book are fantastic. I, for one, was not terribly impressed with the book. I picked it up expecting something new and creative, but instead, I found that there were a lot of similarities betweeen this book and fight club.Though the book was good, I don't think it belongs on my all-time fave list. I recommend you buy a used version and read it for a chuckle."
3,"""Perhaps his best?'","It is difficult to review Palahniuks work. While compelling and narrative, his books have an eerie emptiness about them. There are always several stories within the story. In this story Victor Mancini works in a replica early colonial village. All of the village employees are drug or sex addicts. Victors best friend, Denny also works there, he is hopelessly addicted to masturbating. Victors neurotic mother lives in an expensive convalescent center, so victor fakes choking to death in every restaurant to pity customers into giving him money. Victor goes to sexaholic meetings to pick up women for sex. He tells of his mothers erratic and abusive behavior towards him when he was young, etc. etc., well you get the idea. If you are into twisted tales, cool. If not, leave this book alone, don't read it. You may be sorry."
3,Same old song,"Fight Club is a modern classic. Palahniuk's latest effort, Choke, does not meet that standard. The author does not explore any new territory in this book. The plot is frighteningly similar to Fight Club. Only the names and some scenes are different. The theme is the same. However, Choke is a fine work in of itself. I loved it. If you liked Fight Club, you will be satisfied with spending your money on Choke."
2,Not great,"I found this an easy to read yet dull book. I read half of the books pages in about an hour but had no real motivation to go on, nothing seems to happen, the characters by Palahniuk's standards are dull and rather cliche, you have all manor of freaks as to be expected, but theres the trouble with Palahniuk his side show parade of freaks and geeks is what you expect.If you liked Survivor, and Fight Club there should be no reason why you woulnd't like this, more of the same really but I've found all his books interesting on one level but uninvolving on another, Fight Club worked marvelously as a film, maybe Chuck should look at writing film scripts?Anyway I found this book dissapointing, after plowing through Fight Club, and Survivor and not finishing Choke I think I'm all Palahniukied out."
1,Sound bites only might be worth reading.,"I was given this as a Christmas present with the recommendation that it was ""hilariously funny."" And, if all you read is the sound bite quips every 20 pages or so, it might be. But, as commentary on contemporary society, sex addiction, unemployment, theme parks, dementia - each topic works out to about 3 pages from a sad (and redundant) professional journal article spread out through an entire book interspersed with all the dirty words that are really no surpise anymore."
2,Chuck's fiction is mucho better,"Other than the memoirs, this book is pretty lame. It's written well, and covers some strange topics, but it just doesn't hit Chuck's true ability as a fiction writer."
4,another awesome palahniuk novel,"This is a great book. Yet again, Chuck Palahniuk proves himself to be a very talented, insightful writer. Having read all of his books, I think they just keep getting better as his career goes on, so this being the latest...Other notes: this one doesn't start at the end, like the others. Some specific sentences in the book are very profound, and it is worth reading the whole book just for those (read it for the story too though, it's cool). I would not reccomend this to someone that hasn't read his other works yet, if only because it is interesting to see his development as a writer from survivor to now this. I suggest reading the books in order, I think you would appreciate it more."
5,This book got me casually reading again...,"In the past few years, I can't say I've picked up a novel I wasn't required to read in college. I loved the movie Fight Club, so I decided to check out another work by Chuck Palahniuk. This novel was so interesting, I could not put it down and had it finished in two days! Palahniuk dark humor and depiction of our most animal instincts was incredible. As dark as the main character is in this book, I think most everyone can identify with some of his thoughts. Palahniuk's style allows you to read quickly and aside from a very few slow parts in the book, I could not wait to turn the page. I recommend this book to anyone, especially those who haven't picked up a book in a while. I liked the book so much, I went out and got a copy of all his other books."
2,"Gotta tell you, this ain't his best.","I enjoyed ""Fight Club"" very much. and I did enjoy most of ""Choke.""But style can only take you so far without narrative strength. Choke ain't worth buying."
2,Unsatisfied,The book is sloppy and uninteresting. I know he was trying to make it unstructured which would have been fine if it didn't take away from his ability to tell a good story. The characters are one dimensional and uninteresting which made me really not care what happened to any of them. One part of the end that is supposed to be shocking is predictable the other part of the end was surprising. I feel that if he is trying to make a story that really builds up to a surprise ending it better be really good but he just doesn't deliver.
2,its still the book I wanted,"its a used paperback, I just thought good condition wouldnt come with a bunch of stickers on it and looking like itd be run over by something. lesson learned."
3,A Bit Overdone,"Palahniuk extends his shocking tendencies a bit too far with this novel. The writing is unnecessarily lude, although he is known for that. I had to crawl through this book at times, it was difficult to finish, and the ending was certainly not that impressive. His religious symbolism is overrated and a reach. Sorry Chuck, I've read better from you!"
3,3 1/2 stars,"I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting out of this book, but I almost got it. This is my first Palahniuk novel. I haven't read Fight Club yet (though I've seen the movie and it is one of my favorites). It's an interestingly dysfunctional novel with some of the most interestingly dysfunctional characters. But there is little cohesion to the story. Some of the most interesting episodes we only get the beginning of and Palahniuk doesn't finish other than in telling us later rather than showing us at the time. The characters tend to be irritating and as a whole the story is a bit unbelievable. It's a good effort that falls just a bit short."
2,"Disjointed, but not in a good way","I feel like Chuck's been holding back a bit. It's like he's not sure which direction he wants to go. Like he's straddling the notions of serving the mainstream or pushing the envelope and going more toward the other extreme. Fight Club is hard to follow-up, but seems like there's a bit of a rut here. Very odd. Anyone reading his books out of order might suggest that this was one of his first efforts, and Fight Club his latest. The repetition gimmick gets a bit old, really.That said, I'd still say it's a safe bet that I'll buy and read any other books Chuck has to write."
2,Product Quality Problems,"While the novel has a fine story, and is classic Palahniuk, I can only give the product 2 stars. The binding is of low quality and falls apart easily. My copy came completely unbound after being left in my car for less than 3 hours of a warm-ish Pacific Northwest afternoon. A friend's copy came partially unbound after being left on the floor in his living room five feet from the fireplace.Enjoyable read, but you may want to buy a used hardcover, or borrow it from the library."
2,"""Choke"" is right","After seeing the movie Fight Club, I became interested in author Chuck Palahniuk. He seemed to have such a fiendish sense of humor and made some very provacative commentary with Fight Club, so I decided to read Choke. That was in December. This is July, and I still have not been able to finish. Don't get me wrong--this book has the same cynical view that endeared me to Fight Club, but it just seems a bit pretentious with its dictionary-style addenda spattered throughout and the character's odd choices of phrases such as ""For serious, dude.""Ughhh... it makes me shudder just remembering how tedious and annoying this had become.My flight was delayed for 8 hours in Mexico City yesterday, and even THEN, faced with utter boredom, I still did not reopen Choke for another go. I guess I will finish it eventually, but I sincerely hope the next Palahniuk book I read is ALOT easier to swallow."
1,Not for everyone,"I found the writing style irritating, and the characters dull and boring. The story seemed to drag on and on without actually going anywhere. It might have been decent, but the big plot twist turns out not to make any sense. Not for everyone."
2,"same song, different charactes","I'm a fan of Chuch Palahniuk. I've used Fight Club in my freshman level lit class. Unfortunately, Choke confirmed my fears: Chuck P. is a singer of one song (so far, anyway). Other than substituting sex for violence, the themes (and characters) are no different from FC (except FC is far superior). For example, in Choke, Victor refers to his boss as ""His Highness"" and ""His Lord High."" Tyler uses a similar ""tone"" when referring to the president of the union: ""Mister His Honor."" These comparisons may sound minor, but, reading Choke, I couldn't help but to think of FC and Survivor, to a lesser extent.No new ground is covered here. If you have never read Palahniuk, buy Fight Club or Survivor. This book is little more than a ""re-tread"" of his previous works but done with less brilliance.I do think that FC is a modern classic. I just hope that the author will move on to new territory and explore some other issues of modern life."
1,How did this get published?,"I have no problem with the fact that this book is pretty much soft-core porn. I do have a problem with the fact that it is trying really hard to be meaninful but it's actually pointless, boring, and dumb. If it wasn't for the dirty parts the freakin thing would be unreadable."
4,Palahniuk Views the World in a Different Hue,"Great book. Classic Chuck Palahniuk at his best. His post-modern, cynical world-view will have you thinking the strangest thoughts while reading this winner."
2,It is no Fight Club,"The best part about this book is the first page where the author begs you to please stop reading this book. It goes down hill for another 100 pages until it has some memorable quotes about the best way to make people feel better about themselves is for you to pretend to be worse off than they are and letting them give you their help. I think this writer named Chuck Palahnuik's career will end up like Quentin Tarantino's movies, they continue to sell heavily based on things he wrote 15 years ago, except with a lot lesser cooler name than Tarantino."
5,Big Reader,Wow! Palaniuk is our generations Kafka. His mind is right in front of me no matter which way I turn. The laughter and the pain are neck and neck as this thought provoking wonder reads way up there from end to end. And if you have any experience with 12 Step programs you will feel right at home. I loved it.
2,Strange but boring,This book had a lot of strange things going on but I thought the plot was boring and didn't really go anywhere. It was not a fun or exciting read.
5,What would Jesus NOT do?,"This novel was nothing short of amazing. For serious, it was a delicious and witty meal that satisfies your intellectual appetite and makes you want to gag at the same time. Loved every bite of it.See also: Fight ClubSee also: Survivor"
2,Unfulfilled,"Palahniuk has a gift for pointing out the obvious and making us grimace, for baring the darkest and blackest parts of what makes us human and forcing us to view them with pure honesty, and I admire him for that. But having the talent to entertain and enlighten doesn't necessarily produce a good novel.Choke left me feeling empty and confused. The sex addiction issues and the dysfuncional mother-son relationship were the well developed themes, but I felt as if nothing gelled together to form a complete statement of intent. Despite a very thorough synopsis of humanity's ailments, the plot just became more and more contrived and ridiculous as the book moved on, and the various 'surprise' endings were disappointing, to say the least because they were not developed; it seemed like they were just thrown together at the last minute to bring things to a close.I enjoyed Fight Club but Palahniuk has failed with this one. Hopefully his next effort will be better."
2,What is the point of this book?,"I just did not get the point of this book? I could not tell if it was just a weird tale about a guy with all kinds of problems and hang ups, or whether there was some point to it all. It was entertaining--especially the parts about his escapades--I will give it that, but it left me wondering what the hell was that I just read. I thought it would come to some sort of conclusion, but it did not. If his other books are like this, I don't believe I am going to read them."
2,disapointing,"This poor mans version of Fight Club is surprising ineffective. It seems that Palahniuk is a one trick pony, or maybe this is just the sophomore curse, it's unlikely that I'll trouble to find out, that's how disappointed I was. The characters, instead of representing everyman, seem to be faker than those on a TV sitcom. The story, instead of giving voice to the existential angst of a generation, is simply flaccid nonsense. There is nothing here but a feeble attempt to shock. Very disappointing"
2,I don't know I finished it.,"ChokeI am not usually made to feel sick by graphic imagery in a book, or any other form of communication. I felt sick with this book. This book speaks about sexual addiction (and other things). The descriptions were just too graphic for my tastes. I am surprised that I got through it, in the first place.This book is definitely not for everyone."
3,Sound is not the best,"I liked the looks of this product and it appeared to be durable. However the wood is strung on elastic bands. It has held up to this point but I assumed it would be more rigid. My daughter, who this was a gift for, does play on it but seems to enjoy the metal variety better."
2,xylophone not so good as it looks,"The xylophone looks great, but doesn't make much sound. Very flat, non-resonant tones. One key in particular makes almost no sound."
1,Clunk!,"Not a musical instrument. This xylophone doesn't have bright tuned pitches. Just plain awful especially for children who are learning. Returned right a way. We then bought the Glockenspiel and that made a huge difference, like day and night."
1,As good as a block of wood,There is very little difference in tone between the various bars on this toy. Certainly not enough to play a recognizable tune. Save your money on this one.
1,pointless,"Wood just isn't a good conductor of sound, so there is hardly any sound and the notes are very close in tone. My 18 mo old LOVES anything and everything sound but he could care less about this toy. We were disappointed."
1,PUTRID!,"recently heard this CD and all I can say is ""YIKES""! What was she thinking? Absolute rubbish! I liked her on TV and in movies, but this CD was slammed together by someone trying to make some quick cash. No wonder it was only released in Japan."
4,Very practical - a great way to look at IT,This book really makes you think and look at the business of IT in a different manner. This is the only book I've read on the subject that helps you to know what to do to achieve process profitability. I believe all businesses should read this book and embrace its view of IT and implement the strategies suggested.
4,Good price on some good strings,"These strings are from the largest manufacturer of stringed instrument strings, D'Addario. Excellent quality with very good sound. Unique color coding of the ball end grommets to identify where each string is to be installed on your guitar."
4,Good value product,"The product came in as advertised. It did not have labels on the strings indicating the wire gauges but you can sort of figuring it out by eyeballing the thickness of the wires to see which ones are #1, 2, etc.Pretty good product as well and this is probably the best deal you can get with 3 sets together."
1,Squeaking Nightmare !!!,This is nightmare! I wish I can put zero stars for this product- they sound very unpleasant below 5th fret and is squeaking like hell when move your fingers. Very disappointed.
4,Crisp and Bright Tone,This set of strings are bright and crisp toned. The bass gives a warm tone and they have a ring to them when strummed real hard.Nice for the price.
5,great strings,I use D'addario strings on all of my instruments. They have great tone and last a long time.
3,Meh,These strings are okay. They'll get the job done. I get the feeling that they're grossly overrated. There's nothing really special about these. They kinda just feel like any other strings.
4,The are what I use,"I have used all kinds of strings. These are what I use on a regular basis. They work, they sound great, and their longevity is impressive. Most of all, they are cheap."
3,Good strings but...,"I think these are good strings, but my latest pack was missing the high E, which is kind of annoying considering I broke the high E of my last pack when I was restringing my guitar."
2,G-string snapped,"Bought these to try them out the medium gauge and brand. Mediums too hard on my thin fingers and will stick to light and extra light gauges. The strings were hard to slide, un-slippery, and changing barr chords made so much squeaks I didn't like. Tone is warm but too mellow for my tastes. G-string snapped 2 days later at the windings with the string wounds pried right off :\"
5,Very nice!,"As a novice guitar player I'm still learning how to take care of my guitar, to properly string it and so on. Someone suggested that I buy these strings, and so I did. It's a 3 pack which is always great--more bang for the buck! They strings feel very sturdy, but they're light--not flimsy. When properly tuned they produce a clean, clear sound--absolutely NO TWANG (if that's what you call it--still learning here!) All in all very good. I recommend this product to anyone shopping for acoustic strings."
2,Not the best strings,I restrung my guitar with the new strings and noticed both the B and High E sounded really off like cheap tinny strings. I took them off after a week and put on some I bought at the local guitar shop and they were fine and I noticed a differnce on all the strings. I think buying them in the 3 pack the strings are a different sound/quality they had the color coding on them too. I gave one of the packs to a coworker and the same thing on his guitar too. I gave the last pack to a high school guitar player and he was just happy to get free stings. The price is good so maybe I just got a bad set.
5,Gadzooks,"I read Gadzooks in 2 sittings. I was captivated by the integrity and central focus (no pun intended) of Dr. Dobson's desire to impact families in crisis and for Christ. A gifted writer, Paul Batura lays out the facts of James Dobson's leadership principles in a compelling way that ought to be pondered by any serious student of leadership potential. Also, this is a must read for those desiring to discover what has made Dr. Dobson such an integral figure in 21st century Christian influence."
2,Not Memorable,"I agree with a couple of other reviewers that felt that Remmington was overbearing and Elenor was very weak. I dislike jelly fish women and overly aggressive chip on my shoulder heros.Yes it is understandable that Remmington would want revenge on the man he thinks killed his family. However, using the mans daughter to get revenge has not only been done to death but is also not the mind set that I personnally look for in a hero.I also had trouble understanding why Elenor feel in love with Remmington. What exactly did he do other than kiss her a couple of times before she fell in love with him. There was no getting to know you momments and he spent way too much timing ploting revenge or telling her what she is or is not going to do.Oeverall the lack of charcter development and and lack of chemistry between Elenor and Remmington made this book seem never ending.Sensuality rating 3 out of 5."
2,Could have been better.......,"I haven't read many Christina Dodd books, but I thought she was a better author than this. First of all, I really dislike overbearing heros, constantly telling the woman what to do. Second, another reviewer was right, the vengence plot is so overdone. Finally, some of the language is very obscene. I'm only 25 years old and I was disturbed by the nasty talk. My main objection with this book is the hero. He wasn't likable at all!"
1,absolutely terrible,"It was advertised as refurbished. HA! It was still dirty from the previous owner,the pheronome sticky tape was still on it. complete withbugs. The light feature, didn't work. But like an idiot we plugged it in anyway andcould hear the sound so we thought, ok, it might be allright. I did call the company we ordered it from and they in essence said all they are is a clearing house.I order it, they get it in a box from someone else, don't check it out and send iton.It stopped working after 3 weeks.Awful company, awful service. What a rip."
1,Still waiting for results,"I bought this product and set it up over two months ago. It has only managed to attract a few stray leaves and other random windblown debris. Oh yeah! And one large fly today! Mosquito season is in full swing, and we have a party coming up. It's truth or consequences time."
1,Broken after 1 1/2 yrs......,"The first year the SonicWeb worked great - it is a much needed purchase, as we have a child allergic to mosquitos! However, we are at the start of the summer in year 2, and the machine is not working at all. I called the company, and I am out of warranty (1 yr warranty), and they could not provide me any other number or helpful information to assist with repairing this broken machine. Definitley would NOT recommend to anyone."
4,Good Tchaikovsky collection at a bargain price.,"Tchaikovsky was a great composer, even if some critics have villified his music for being too melodic and too ""accessible."" Fortunately, the public has been wise enough to see melodic beauty and accessibility as virtues rather than vices. This two CD set presents many of Tchaikovsky's most popular compositions -- all performed well, and some performed outstandingly. In the outstanding category I would place the three works conducted by Leopold Stokowski -- perhaps the greatest conductor of the 20th century -- and the performance of the violin concerto by the great -- but under-appreciated -- violinist, Henryk Szeryng. The works performed by other artists are still quite good. It would be hard to find a better bargain-priced collection of Tchaikovsky's most popular works."
1,stuck with it!,"well. this is more like a complaint ,because i never got to use this item because it was not compatible with my camera and the seller in their infinite wisdom decided not to replace said item because the package was open .c,mon man dont be like that,you might get me once but you can be sure I will never buy anything else from you ever again .it was only $22.00 and for such little amout you show the people what kind of bussines you are running What happened to the customer is always right?"
5,excellent work from New New Thing author,"Michael Lewis wrote the best-selling Liars Poker, about cowboy market traders in the 80's. He followed it up with The New New Thing, a wonderful book about Silicon Graphics and Netscape founder Jim Clark. This video is based on a later book, and is a fascinating take on the Internet.Lewis travels to Ireland to ask geriatrics downing Guinness how the Internet has changed their lives. He finds a medieval town with broadband cables under the cobblestones. He looks inside the control centre for AOL, where the ""elite"" keeping this Web site going look more like a bunch of stoners.A great video for hardcore netheads or to give your newbie friends and family for Christmas"
3,Extremely Relevant...But...,"Author Robert H. Knight, in his ""Age of Consent,"" tackles a huge topic. Yet his historic survey-like description of popular culture's decline misses two key consequences of ""Relativism,"" as a social ethos: (1) Comparativism (which neutrally treats all 'belief/opinion systems' as equally valid); and (2) Moral Legalism (which suggests that legal permissibility--and arguable legal versions of fact, however interpretive--is the ultimate moral authority. (If it's legal, or in a gray area, or undetectable...it's OK, so long as no real harm comes to anyone.) The author fails to expand on the two-edged sword predicament of Relativism, as both a media marketing necessity in a multi-ethnic America, and also the divisive foundation for potential Balkanization. A good intro to the subject."
5,Easy installation,"Here goes; my wife's son bought 96 Grand Caravan SE 3.3 while she was in N.H. for a new grandbaby in Sept.08. I flew up to drive it back to Tx. with her. Pouring down rain in Va. mountains no problem, fell off twice in a week on damp street after we got back. Found fix on net, bought at RockAuto, Midway is cheaper now. Easier than stated; idler nut accesible from underneath with 18""-24"" extension and flexible socket, welded extension to 15mm Gearwrench for tensioner, put belt on compressor LAST, make max stroke on tensioner, put belt on a/c pulley as far as possible, take another stroke on wrench, slips right on. 30-45 minutes total."
5,Must have for Caravan !!!,"Nephew was stranded on I-5 late one nite due to poor design and overall cheapness on Chrysler's part.Purchased kit, he helped install it, and has been confident and safe every since. This kit should be the first thing you install when purchasing this van, new or used!"
5,Fixed wet weather belt slip on '97 Town & Country,"Great price and seems to have stopped the belt slip I often get during rain on my '97 Town & Country. We have had more rain than I can remember this year and I have had 2 tows since the summer for belt slip. This kit was only $20 more than just the belt I had put on last time and mechanic, who installed it, said he couldn't get it for less. Bought 2, will save the parts and stow the extra belt. Recommend tensioner replacement at belt replacement as a routine thing because of the labor in putting on a belt. Still on the original kit/belt 11-20-12 (installed 9-14-11)."
4,Great Scooper,I use this scooper to scoop wood pellets into my wood stove. Appears to be well made and is the perfect size. Not too heavy yet not too light that you would think there is no metal on it. Gets the job done and I've been using it for about 4 months with no complaints.
1,"NOT ""WELCOME"".","Mere months past the warranty expiration the machine is frozen on ""welcome"" and NOTHING will fix it. After online research I see this is a common problem with this machine with no solution. According to the Sony website they will fix the problem for a flat rate of 114.00 which I think would be put to better use on a non-sony recorder. For years I have been faithful to Sony only electronics, however, the company seems to have outsourced it's quality relying only on it's reputation to carry it. My next dvd recorder WILL NOT be Sony."
1,WARNING! UNABLE TO PAUSE LIVE RECORDING,"I bought this item as a replacement for the GX300, which lost the ability to format discs (a common problem for this model). I was told by the Sony Rep. that the GX330 was identical to the GX300 except for some improvements. WRONG. Everything about the newer model is different, as in ""worse."" Even the menus were different. Several features that I liked on the older model were left out, such as a 3rd line input. But the real shocker - are you ready for this - THERE IS NO WAY TO PAUSE LIVE RECORDING. Unbelievable - but true. I'll be sending this one back."
2,A disappointment,"Had this item for just a year and it went out on us...just froze up. Couldn't even get the DVD out that was in it. Unplugged it and let it set for a month or so, when we plugged it back in it reset and worked for about a week and then went out again. Expected better from Sony. While it was working loved the convenience of being able to watched recorded programs on DVD, but was a little frustrated with the time it took for the thing to load, prepare to record, and write, etc. Couldn't just pop it in and start recording like with a VHS. Will need to find another one to replace it with. Won't go with the same model, and probably won't get another Sony either."
2,"Modern attitude in old-fashioned story, doesn't work","Lady Catherine has scandalized her relatives by insisting on doing something, rather than sitting prettily and enjoying her widowhood. In fact, she has opened a school and is teaching young ladies to think for themselves.The Marquess of Charlmont has agreed to investigate this school at the request of his latest flirt. It turns out that they are acquainted.Rather unbelievable romance ensues, dastardly relations try to interfere, but true love conquers all.Not a favorite, as the heroine is not very believable and both main characters are too modern in their outlooks and relationship. I'm put off when writers of historical fiction try to make their characters behave in a way that is acceptable by today's standards. I can't really recommend this one.I see that other reviewers have really enjoyed it, but I really did not."
2,fantasy!,"This movie is nothing more than fantasy, not based on real facts. The only real thing would be the costumes. There is no revolution , love story or no palace on the top of the hill like the one I saw in this movie. Ava Gardner and Omar Shariff are great actor/actresses but they made the scenario to make them play like an ordinary actor/actress. The movie is one time watch just for curiousity. You might have fun if you watch it as a comedy because the story is ridicolous, does not reflect any reality from Ottoman Empire history."

3,Here's a Heady Mix...,"Judging by Jonathan Rhys Meyers' (Chris Wilton) choice of reading material early in his climber (that would be social, not rock) days, Woody wants to invoke Dostoevsky. And yes, there is a bit of Crime and Punishment here, also Crimes and Misdemeanors, also lesser Hitchcock, but mostly it's 2/3 The Talented Mr. Ripley, with a third An American Tragedy and a little twist at the end. Way too long at over two hours and with Rhys Meyers at his smarmiest (which, to be fair, is precisely what he is supposed to be) Match Point is chiefly enjoyable for the last half hour and the way Scarlett Johansson burns through her part and the movie. See it for her, but for not much else."
2,Terrible copy of Crimes & Misdemeanors,"The only people who seem to like this film are people that are not Woody Allen fans. Because if you were, you would realize this is an incredibly poor copy of his previous work, Crimes & Misdemeanors, which was in turns funny, thoughtful, suspenseful, etc. Allen's works obviously do repeat many of the same themes, but Match Point is literally more of a derivative work. Even if this were a new film, it's terribly flawed. The viewer isn't trusted at all to understand the issues of the story, and so themes and images are featured in a highly repetitious manner. (One scene I especially hated was a closeup of a tennis ball straddling the net and eventually tipping to illustrate the theme of chance, which had already come up numerous times...) Disappointing. BTW, the people are better looking than in Crimes, but everyone keeps their clothes ON, so don't get too excited. Do yourself a favor, and just get Crimes & Misdemeanors."
4,"BEAUTIFUL, RAW, PROFOUND","This is a scathing portrait of love, yearning, and adultery. A scathing portrait of lucky versus unlucky. A heartbreaking portrait of sincerity versus deceit.Chris is beguiling. Chloe is innocent. Tom is totally cool. Nola is irresistible.These four characters meet, mix, and mate. The results are explosive.I am far from a Woody Allen fan, but this is his crowning achievement. The camera angles, the close-ups, the architecture of London are all superb. Matthew Goode is fierce. Scarlett Johansson is tantalizing.This movie seduces, repels, and shocks."
2,Woody's wooden muse.,"So Woody Allen is currently fixated on Scarlett Johansson. Oh Woody, you should be ashamed of yourself. Is it just me or is Johansson rapidly becoming the most overrated actress of her generation?First of all, Match Point is an overstylized standard adultery plot. A couple of nice touches here and there and some good actors totally wasted. Non-actor Johansson really brought down the grading curve. She's terrible! She was terrible in Ghost World and she was even worse in Lost in Translation. Sure, she may be maturing as a woman, but she sure needs acting lessons.Critics! Stop reviewing Scarlett Johansson with organs other than your brains!Match Point is a bore. Don't let anyone tell you differently."
3,Just didn't feel like a Woody Allen Film,"Nice change of venue from New York to London, but you could not tell this was Woody Allen's work if you sat on it. The movie lacked the wry quirkiness that is so typical of Woody. Despite this being a drama versus a comedy, I didn't see an imprint of Woody's style in this film in any way shape or form. Was it really directed by Woody Allen? I had to check the DVD cover to be sure.I did like the idea of the ""matchpoint"", explained via narration in the begining of the film and the scene of the tennis ball striking the top of the net with the potential to fall on either side. Woody Allen explored the concept of how fortune and luck played a bigger role in people's lives more than they claimed it did. In the case of the main character Chris, fortune very quickly was falling out of favor with him. Was he man enough to withstand the consequences or would he force fate his way?Worth a watch but disappointinlgy mainstream."
5,A matter of luck,"Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a former tennis pro now working at a posh London tennis club. There he meets a wealthy family, befriends the son and romances the daughter. Things are looking good for Chris as he starts climbing the corporate ladder, and then he meets would-be actress Nola (Scarlett Johansson).I knew nothing of this movie beforehand and assumed it was just a poor-boy-makes-good story; then came the last twenty minutes and I was shocked. The movie changed completely and I loved it. This Woody Allen film has been rightly compared with Hitchcock's work. Indeed, Chris is quite similar to Ray Milland's character inDial M for Murder; both are charming, retired/washed-up tennis stars-pretty boys who marry well and aren't big on ethics. While both Meyers and Johansson underplay their parts and have little chemistry together, the story is so good that I thoroughly enjoyed it. The movie is expertly directed and has a strong British supporting cast; heartily recommended."
3,Slow at times...with a good ending,"I enjoy existentialism, so by the end of this film I was really intrigued. I was watching it with friends that don't know Dostoevsky from Charlie Brown, and they all hated it...I think they expected a lighthearted romantic comedy or something.... But I would think anyone with an appreciation for philosophy would enjoy this film. It's worth the 5 buck rental."
3,With My Face to the Enemy,"A star-studded cast, but not a lot of topical or scholarly innovation in this collection of essays. Many of the essays seem to be simple narratives of battles that whole books have been published about elsewhere. There are some interesting bits -- Griffith's article on tactics is a bright spot, as is Trudeau on entrenchment. In this sort of work, though, I'm really looking for more innovative, new scholarship, and that's not what I see here.I'm unable to refrain from mentioning that I feel the concept of Jackson having a ""learning disability"" is poppycock. I recommend Robertson's biography of the general."
4,Good controller,"The setup of the Dreamcast controller is cool and it comes in different colors. This one happens to be blue and it's just like the other controllers. It's not hard to get used to this controller and just like the others it can hold tremor packs and the VMUs. The only set back is that the cord comes out of the front instead of the back. There is a little hole that you can put the cord through but it would've been better if it was just put through the back so it wouldn't be in your way while you're playing. Overall, it's a cool controller."
3,Is a yellow controller too much to ask for?,"Well, if you have a Dreamcast and want a blue controller, I'd say you've come to the right place. I never liked the DC controller (I'm more of a Playstation Dual Shock kind of guy), but if you have a DC, you've got little choice. This model is pretty sturdy and it's blue. Can't get much better than that."
5,Classic!,"A loopy concoction of transcendant post-punk pop. There are a few clunkers here (Primitive Man, I'm Waiting for my Man) but the brilliance of the gems (You Sent All My Letters, Happy Spider, They Say Hurray, Albert is a Headbanger, Fine Art in Silver, etc.) more than makes up for it. My favorite: ""Merry My Mind"", in which Pia Lund plays the innocent, cruelly deprived of love in childhood, who nevertheless is ready to bound headlong into an ill-considered relationship: ""...stupidity it can't be so strong--let's go to the preacher!"" Tragic and yet funny, and you can hardly keep from jumping up to dance!"
3,Music by Gustav Johannes Gabrielli,"The technical playing and recording is OK. The interpretation is way off sounding as if no effort was spared to make this sound like it was written by a collaboration between Mahler, Wagner, and Brahms ... or something like that. The result is over-interpreted playing, often ponderous and lacking in snap and rhythmic drive. There are inappropriate ritardandos and attempts at lovely legato and sweet sections. The attempt to simulate the echo parts by having a subset of the group -- who are still in the same proximity to the microphones as everybody else -- play quietly doesn't work for me. Rather than an echo group who are still contributing to the rhythmic drive, it just sounds like a few guys playing quietly in such a way as to suck the life out of the piece. The 3-CD set of Gabrielli on Naxos is vastly superior."
3,OK Overview but not enough in-depth info,"I was excited to see that a MOM 2005 book was finally published. The documentation from MS is pretty superficial. While this book seems to cover the basics pretty well, it doesn't seem to cover the details or much beyond explaining the basic functions. For example, it barely mentions the Performance monitoring aspect of MOM--pretty frustrating if you need that info. It also doesn't go much into alerting and the details of paging technicians. Overall it's an okay HowTo but it could have been more."
1,grass seed,i used the grass seed and nothing came up no grass it all i followed step by step the instructions i used before and worked now no
3,Warning windows XP users,"My pictures were fine on the camara's LCD display but I tried numerous times to download the software and even had polariod's Tech support on the phone, but the software would not download not from the CD nor the website. The software was not being recognized by windows XP. After two weeks of back and forth with polaroid tech support telling me it was XP compatible and a consultation with tech support from the manufacturing of my computer telling me to get XP compatible downloads from polaroid I gave up and took the camara back. According to polaroid tech support and on there website the 1320's download software is compatible with XP. On the box when I was taking the camara back I noticed that Windows XP was not listed as one of the operating systems the camara was compatible with."
4,SO SORRY..,"BOUGHT THE CAMERA AND LIKE THE VALUE OF IT, HOWEVER YOU CANNOT USE IT WITH WINDOWS 98, SO I HAD TO RETURN THE CAMERA BECAUSE OF THAT!"
1,Disapointed,"I found the last one at the local Echarts, half price,but even at 60 dollars I have to take it back.I have to reboot everytime i want to transfer pics from the camera to the PC.I could possibly live with this but the pictures are grainy and really poor. I`ll stick with my trusty FUJI.."
4,xavix powerboxing,"We purchased this product for our son, but found that the whole family enjoyed playing it. It's a way to exercise and have fun at the same time. We would recommend this product."
4,A deeper mystery than I expected....,"I expected this to be a light, fun mystery. I did not expect the issues such as bigotry and religious hatred touched on in the book, but they greatly added to the plot. I really enjoyed the book, and plan to read the others in the series ASAP."
4,Great Start To New Mystery Series,"I liked this book very much. I am now getting the rest of the series. It was a good mystery, but was alot of fun too. I am from the south so I could relate. Recommend this to any one who likes a good mystery with some fun added in. Rachel Porter is a great charter."
2,Klipsch ProMedia 5.1,Had to send it back to Klipsch TWICE! The sub keeps going out. Finally went to Logitech to get a system that would work reliably for more than a month.
4,Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 speakers,"Great speakers for the price. Some music with just the right tone of bass will cause the small speakers to distort at what seems to be a lower volume than it should. Music with more bass can be played louder with better sound and no distortion than rock type music. The Sub Woofer only takes care of the lowest bass notes. It would be nice to have more mid range volume clarity, but are very impressive for the size.Sometimes the amplifier will overheat after high volumes for extended time periods. An entire album could probably be played at max volume with no trouble. I use it 9 hours at a time almost every day, as loud as it will play without distortion. It still works great though with no side effects. Overall I would recommend these speakers."
3,DIN Plug Nighmares,"Wonderful sound - Cheap DIN plugOne little 3 cent plug turned my $150 amazing sound speaker system into a pile of trash. Since then, I've been reading tons of people in blogs with similar problems and very few solutions. The plug is so flimsy that, it broke when I moved the subwoofer to clean under it! Once broken, nothing works! The replacements are so few, some people wait for months for them. There are several people making a killing on EBAY who promise to fix your DIN plug!On the company's web site, they still refuse to see there's a problem, despite the number of people with faulty plugs. Their overpriced replacement items fly off the shelves!! There are WAITING LISTS for this one item!Next time, I am buying something else!"
5,Great Sound,"These speakers are the best sounding speakers I've ever heard in this price range. The bass is amazing and the satellites bring out the high end wonderfully. The mid range is a bit lacking but I was able to tweak the EQ in my computer to get the nice creamy mids that I like. I highly recommend this product to anyone interrested in MP3s. While I havent tried out gaming with these speakers, they sound fairly good while watching DVDs."
2,Lacks mids,"The Klipsch Promedia 2.1 speakers deliver excellent highs and impressive bass, but lack the mid tones essential to so much music. While the speakers sound great for movies, TV shows, rap, and pop music, they certainly require EQ adjustment when listening to rock, jazz, and country. They aren't bad speakers, but my room mate's Logitech speakers are more veritile and don't require the adjustments. If I could do it over again, I would have gone with the Logitech Z-2300.Update: After roughly 4 years of use (very heavy the first two years, and very light the next two years due to a move with a different setup), these speakers no longer work. Something has happened with the main connection from the sub to the satellite. I downgraded the rating to 2 stars, because for the money I feel like they should have lasted longer."
2,Be wary of faulty right channel,"Got the speakers brand new and could not get the + - wires from the speaker to fit flush into right channel clamps. Returned the product, got it working for about two albums, sounded great, but then the same problem occurred. I guess the wires became dislodged somehow. I tried to plug them back into the clamp and could not pick up any sound. I tried getting in contact with sales reps at Klipsch and they could not help me. I find myself back in the market looking for new speakers."
5,Klipsch ProMedia 2.1,"These are fantastic speakers. I think you can really judge a speaker at low volume. These are very crisp, clean, at low or high volume. I have not had them past 1/2 way, and that is righteous for Me. I also want to mention the Customer Support, it was also fantastic. On the phone friendly knowledgable, good people. Emails answered within 48 hours. Fed ex lost the wall brackets and they were replaced the day after FedEx admitted they were lost. I highly recommend this company. And know you will love these speakers for music and gaming. Enjoy"
5,Great 2.1 computer speakers.,"Best bang for your buck. Speakers put out a lot of power, nice crisp clean highs with good bass that rocks."
2,"Great speakers, bad jacks.","So I really love these speakers. I've bought 3 sets of them.The speakers are excellent with good sound throughout. The problem is that both the headphone jack and the subwoofer jack are of very poor quality. They will fail *far* before the otherwise great speakers. I don't move my speakers around, they sit in one spot. Yet somehow the jacks still manage to fail.I probably won't ever buy another set as I'm tired of getting rid of otherwise good speakers because the $5 jack failed.5 stars for sound Quality. 1 star for Equipment Quality."
5,For Aficionado's Only!,"This set is so `over the top' and amazing that only a computer/sound geek can appreciate it. Klipsch is right up there with Bose and Denon for quality. Toss those package speakers and go for the gold! This is as good as a home theater sound system. 35 watts per channel and 130 watts for the subwoofer is only for the aficionado. The sound is classic master and the bass is killer. I have a surround 5.1 system in my living room, but in my den/office, this sound keeps me just as happy. I cannot believe how much of a crazy consumer I have become. This set rocks!"
2,No free trial!,"Bought with high expectations. Not worth the money to me. $25 postage to return. Thanks for nothing, Klipsch. Buyer be scared!"
2,Subwoofer was defective,"When I received this speaker set the subwoofer was DOA. The satellite speakers worked fine but the subwoofer produced no sound (pre-amp was fried). A replacement set worked perfectly. I note that at least one other reviewer noted problems with the subwoofer.When the set works, the sound quality is quite good, though not as a good as the Bose alternative (however the Bose speakers cost quite a bit more). I was somewhat conscious from the satellite speakers' sound that it was originating from small containers.If not for the usability issue I experienced, I would have given four stars for sound quality."
2,Avoid this model,"I bought them driven mainly by the name and THX certification. Upon arrival they were upgraded with Monster Cable satellite cables (original cables are garbage) and... pretty good sound for the size. I mean, I heard a lot of them and being rather picky on the sound I have to admit that these soundED impressive...for the PC media speakers. That is where the positive ends, and it happened approx. in 1 year. Right channel died and refused to resurrect after I checked all the connections. That is when I start to google and found out that there might be a club of Sorry-a*se-owners of Klipsch Pro Media 2.1 speakers. To make the long story short I'm not going to repeat all what I fond on the web about this particular model. It made me wonder, how the company with established brand name allowed this disaster? Years of complaints and still the same problem? Unbelievable and totally unexpected."
1,Great sound while it lasted,"I've owned these for about 2 years and for the past 6 months I have been having a feedback problem from the sub-woofer. Even with no music playing there is a humming sound that comes from the sub-woofer constantly. The only way to make it stop id to turn the unit off, which means no sound from any of the speakers. Buyer beware! I'm going back to a name brand that I can trust...Logitech."
5,Wow,"Jesus. These speakers caught me totally off guard. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING sound, obviously I cant describe you just need to hear them for yourself. BTW, the two frontrunners in this category seem to be these speakers and the audio engine 2's. GO WITH THESE. I bought the AE2's and they are nowhere near this level quality, at 100$ more.These are the best computer speakers on the market, bar none. Seriously, buy now."
5,This system ROCKS!!!!,"This system is excellent. High quality, installs fast, and produces great sound. I listen to rock music and this system just kills. For softer rock like the Beatles it picks up things like the cymbals, bass and guitar parts you hear on expensive systems or headphones. For hard rock and metal it has all the volume you would ever need. On my system anything over 30% volume (over 20% my dog leaves the room) is too loud for even the hardiest of headbangers and it accurately reproduces everything from the recordings. There is a LOT of bass and volume available and I can't imagine there is a system that's any better for $149."
2,"Great Sound, NOT BUILT TO LAST",I loved these speakers for nearly 3 years. Then the DIN cable that goes from the control pod (right speaker with controls) to the subwoofer stopped working. Search the internet; it's a common problem after you've had them for a while. Don't buy these if you want them to work for more than a few years.
1,Poor design Klipsch Computer Speakers,"The Speakers have 2 poor designs. There is no power on/off switch. The only way to turn them off is by unplugging. The wire harness where you plug in the individual speaker wires into the subwoofer is absolute garbage. Their are springs which easily pop off and they are cumbersome to reattach. I had one shoot back into the speaker. There was no retrieving it. I had to break apart a pen and use the spring out of it to fix it.I am a huge Klipsch fan. I own them for my home theater and have had them for previous home stereo systems.The sound out of these desktops are great. However, with the poor speaker wire harness design and no on/off switch, I highly recommend finding a different set of speakers."
5,Great value,"Not as good as my Denon home theater system. But that's not how I am use these speakers. For attaching to my computer to play Pandora and Jukebox, they produce some really decent sounds with adequate bass. I am very pleased.The system was easy to set up. The two sound adjustment buttons are on the front of the main satellite and are easy to adjust. The satellite speakers are relatively small but quite heavy, like they probably contain good quality components. The subwoofer is bigger than I expected (which is a good thing if you have room for it) and it can be adjusted to vibrate the floor.I experimented with my laptop, desktop, and netbook. As you'd expect, the sound drivers really matter! It was easy to switch back and forth between computers, because there is just one wire from computer to subwoofer."
2,back in the box,"Out of the box these speakers met and exceeded all expectations. I enjoyed them for approximately one year. As other reviewers have noted many fail over time. Time is up,the speakers are back in the box."
5,Easy access inputs,"I second the positive reviews. These are amazing. And though it's not obvious, the headphone jack and input jack are easily accessed on the right speaker. I couldn't be happier."
3,Where the 80's still rule.,"I just saw these guys recently and this disc captures their energy well. My thinking is....they should have been huge in 1987. I believe that's their thinking too, as they continue to dress, act, and rock like any quality hair-band from that decade. They have in fact been together for 23 years. The truth is though, these songs are really good, and you might call them excellent if you're still playing Bon Jovi and Journey in your house. The guitarist makes his playing look as easy as his high-kicks. If you don't get one of their discs, at least go see them. It's alot of fun, they also play many covers, and all the girls with big hair in tight jeans magically appear. Just like 1987."
3,Only one receiver works.,"Two things:1. it works fairly well, some static/interference but once you move the unit to another place, interference/static will go away.2. it comes with 2 receivers but only one works, the one that doesn't work stopped working after only 4 weeks of use! that was a bummer.I would buy this product again, only if there were no other monitors available. For me, if only one receiver works, it's a mediocre product."
4,Exactly what we needed,"We purchased this monitor as a replacement for the FP Sights & Sounds monitor which was five years old and had seen better days. We had consistent reception problems and static with the FP model. I love the fact that it comes with two receivers (one we keep in the bedroom and we keep one downstairs), and that all units can be plugged into A/C power.I was pleased to find we experienced no static or reception problems with this model-I'd gotten so used to hearing ""white noise"" that I actually kept checking the Graco model to make sure it was on!My daughters are five years old, but we still like to have a monitor in the room in case someone falls out of bed or wakes during the night. I'm very satisfied with this product.The only thing that kept it from getting five stars was the volume-I really wish we could turn it up louder."
3,"Ok, but lots of static in our house","Trying to find a static free monitor, we live in San Francisco with lots of people nearby. Thought this might work but it didn't solve our problem. Decent monitor but lots of static on both channels"
4,Quality monitor at a good price,"I purchased this monitor after our monitor died while we were on vacation. Based on reviews I chose the Graco Ultra Clear II. I wanted a monitor with two handset. Most of the monitors I looked at only came with one. This monitor has been great so far. Very clear sound, no static, and works well even when we are in the front yard. I find the night light feature helpful. The volume control could be a little better but it's a minor complaint."
1,Poor Quality,These monitors are poorly made. They stopped working after two weeks. When they were working the noise and feedback was terrible. Stay away - much better quality monitors are out there
3,"Ok, but could be better!","This Baby Monitor performs adequately, but not great. We can definitely hear when the baby cries, and the red lights indicating noise is an added bonus, but there is a constant static that you hear as well. The static is not too loud, but noticeable. I'm sure results may vary, but for the price and functionality, this still works okay for us."
5,great little monitor!!!!,"Graco Ultra Clear II 49MHZ Baby MonitorThis monitor is great! We actually use it to monitor an ill adult who may need help in the night. It does not buzz or whine, but can hear clearly if there is a call for help. She keeps a bell nearby in case she cannot speak loudly enough to wake me. And, because there are two receivers, I don't have to remember to move the primary one to another room."
3,"Works, but is LOUD","We purchased this monitor after using the Fisher Price lights and sound monitor that we had with our first child, 6 years ago (and still worked great, but we had lost the power cords and were going through LOTS of batteries). This is a nice monitor. I like the glowing light on the base that you put in babies room. However, even when you put the monitor on the lowest sound level, it is still very loud. I am a light sleeper, and would prefer a quieter setting. I can hear every little grunt and noise baby makes during the night and it is distracting. Some parents may prefer this, but not me."
1,Both parent units stopped working w/in 3 weeks of purchase.,"Both parent units/receivers stopped working within about a week of each other. When we turned the parent units to ""on,"" we would hear sound from the nursery unit/transmitter for a fraction of a second----then nothing but white noise. This white noise/static sounded much like the fan in our nursery...so we didn't even know that the receivers had broken until we heard crying from the nursery (and then realized, ""Wait...we're not hearing that in the monitor at all"").We're very careful with our electronics...and judging by the fact that these both stopped working independently of each other, I know it had nothing to to with the AC adapters, a mix-up on the channel selection, etc.Fortunately had a few days left before Amazon's 30-day return policy ended, so shipped back for a full refund."
5,A great product,I bought these for my grandbaby but they stayed at my house instead. They work beautifully. Came on time and were exactly as advertised.
1,I get really bad feedback/static reception...,"I bought this set hoping that despite the low price, it would work based on the reviews on this site. Well, not for us- we get horrible static reception/feedback despite moving the monitors to several different areas in the house. I really like the light sensor option on the front, and wished these would have worked out for us. And yes, battery hogs they are- I think my batteries lasted a day and a half with the monitor being on maybe a few hours each day, before they went out. I'll be returning this back to Amazon..."
2,Get the Sony NTM-910 Dual,"I own the Sony NTM-910 and this model. I much prefer the Sony, since it comes with rechargeable batteries in the receivers which automatically recharge, whereas the Graco won't even recharge batteries if you buy them yourself. Also, the Sony is voice-activated, which means it is completely silent until the baby makes noise, even when turned all the way up. The Graco on the otherhand, you have to turn almost all the way down to avoid a constant hum, which will make you an insomniac in no time quick if you turned it up. I just assumed all monitors had this feature, and am sorely missing it on this one. The Sony NTM-910 comes in a dual receiver model, which I would recommend over this. I almost bought it but due the (...) price difference I opted for this model. However, the (...) will quickly be eaten up in battery costs, so no real advantage there."
2,I have to put them together.........,"I purchased these items for my 4 year old. She likes them very much. I however was less than thrilled. I was disapointed to find I had to cut and ASSEMBLE the puppets.In the discription it mentions that they need to be cut out, it does not mention that these puppets (9 of them) need to be assembled also with a hot glue gun.If you follow the directions as I did when you turn the puppets back right side out they do not look like the items shown on the site.Luckily I have a 4 year old who thinks I am wonderful for making the puppets, so I guess that makes up for it.The discription should have had in bold letter assembly required."
1,Be warned!! This is a Bootleg.,This is a bootleg dvd set. (Fake) I didn't buy it because its a bootleg. The name of the disturber 'Fx' is a bootleg name. Just google it and you know it. The only real english version is from pioneer/Geneon.
1,"Great research, abominable writing","Ms. Goodrich undoubtedly knows what she is talking about, and has done her research. However, her writing style and grammar are so horrific that I was completely unable to finish even the first quarter of the book.Her sentences are disjointed, she makes frequent reference to events and myths without sufficient background information for the reader, and cannot seem to hold a cohesive thought in her head for more than the length of a sentence. Her writing skips off on tangents and rabbit trails, and generally fails to lead to any logical conclusions or coherent presentation.The research is there, but she's unable to express it to her audience in either a narrative format or a reference format. A huge, huge disappointment."
3,I Loved This Movie...,"When I saw this movie on television, I loved it. It's a bit of an older movie, but being based on actual events just made me like it more. Being an older recording, though, it's not the best picture, not HD or even near HD."
3,"Not bad, but not amazing","Very Michael Crichton-- but the characters are a bit thin and setting them up seems a little strained (gee, I WONDER if he'll get together with the perky Asian counter-culture computer nerd?)... but the overall story is clever, the twists are nice and it's SO a big-budget movie waiting to happen. I'm a fan of theme parks and am impressed at his homework about the operations of them, it's great... overall a fun read."
3,Fast paced,"I am a huge fan of the Preston/Child collaborations. Utopia is the first solo effort I have read. Others have detailed the plot line, so I'll just give you my thoughts. This book is fast paced, but it lacks the suspense books like Relic possess. I loved the theme park setting. And the concept for that park is breath-taking, but I felt it was under-utilized. The park is so clever that dozens of twists and turns leap to mind that could have added suspense to this novel. The plot is predictable and you know who the bad guy is almost immediately. My other complaint with the story is the lack of fleshing out John Doe. I kept wanting it to be Eric Nightingale come for revenge on the commercialization of his dream, but we never get a good look at who John Doe is. All this being said, I still recommend this book as a fast paced and fun read, but I much prefer the Lincoln/Child colaborations. If you haven't read any of them pick up Relic and Reliquary or Cabunet of Curiousities first."
5,"A Good, Fun Read","I have read and enjoyed most of Lincoln Child's previous works with Douglas Preston. I had my doubts coming into the novel that Child could meet my expectations in a solo outing. But he did. In fact Child exceeded my expectations. I throughly enjoyed this book: from the dialogue to the technical descriptions to the imaginative park setting, this was a great read and one I will probably repeat in a few years. If you want a fun thrill read Utopia."
1,Fun Park Big Disappointment,"Fisher Price usually designs fun workable toys for kids. This Fun Park was a big flop. The roller coaster track is a complete waste. The car comes down the hill and crashes every time. My husband who is a design engineer says the track was never designed for the car to actually travel on it completely. The ferris weel and swing are ok, however they do come off quite easily during normal play. Overall this is a very bulky toy that was a big dissappointment."
2,Nice to see but makes a toddler frustrated!,This is such a sweet set to look at. Can be difficult for a toddlers to use. The slide is difficult to latch the cars on. The pieces do not stay connected. A slight push & the set is all to pieces. We bought this for our daughter's 2nd birthday & now at 3 still has trouble with it. Fisher Price did come out with a new Fun Park with a small slide & different pieces. So maybe they improved it. The farm is wonderful & suggest that as a toy which will be used everyday.
2,Takes up a lot of space for a toy that is not played with,"We bought this toy for my daughter when she was 2 and since then we had another baby who is now 2. Neither of the them show much interest in the toy. I agree with the reviewer who said the loop needs to be re-deigned as the track keeps popping off. Also, for some reason the cars that came with it no longer make it all the way around the loop, let a lone all the way around the track. This toy is unwieldy and if you are short on space for toys, not a good investment. My daughters play with the Fisher Price Circus Train, but not this one."
2,not the favorite little people set,"I have to say this is the least played with set we have. And we have A LOT of little people. It is really a cute idea and when it is played with my daughter likes it, but the cars don't stay on very well or they don't make it all the way to the end of the ramp and out of the clown's mouth. It is also very large and although the pieces store inside it, it takes up a lot of room for storage."
4,Fun at the Park,"My 10 month old loves this toy. We play for quiet awhile with it. Her favorite part is when the car pops out of the mouth of the clown, (she squills with delight evertime!) Although I do see the problem with the people staying in the airplane ride and Ferris wheel, if you try to spin them at child speed they come FLYING out! (they made the holes to big for the people) I have had NO problem with the cars staying on track like others and even if there isn't any people in the car. I think it is a great toy to spend some time playing with your child! One more thing is I think they should have added some circus music/carseol music!"
3,"Not that bad, but still not that good.","This DVD is not, as advertised, ""the finest, the most charming and humorous animated shorts"" ever. There are some great Spike & Mike shorts that are missing. Where's ""Bob's Birthday"", ""How To Kiss"", or any Aardman or Bruno Bozetto shorts. There are some good shorts however; ""Bambi Meets Godzilla"", ""The Queen's Monastairy"", ""Slim Pickings"", and ""Panther"". ""Bsss"" and ""Graveyard Jamboree With Mysterious Mose"" are just okay. The rest range from medicore (""Son of Bambi Meets Godzilla"", ""Chicken Coop"") to just awful (""Barflies"" was the most annoying to me). Hope Spike & Mike releases another, better, funnier DVD."
1,something is wrong with the manufacturing of this item,"I have been waiting for these glasses to be available for months and was thrilled when I was notified my order would finally be filled. They arrived today and there are flaws on each one! The glasses have seams spaced 1/3 of the way around each glass (total of 3 seams on each glass) that is rough. I have champagne flutes, wine glasses, cordial stemware, and shot glasses (bought by mistake but so cute I kept them), water tumblers and two pitchers in this pattern and none of the other pieces have seams like that. It is as if a step of the manufacturing was left off where the seams would be buffed smooth. Also, one box had paper dividers in the middle of the box only so the two glasses on either side bounced against each other during shipping. Of course the lips of those glasses are cracked and pieces have fallen out. I am returning the glasses but I hope I can get undamaged ones in the future."
4,If you use A/D chips and need a reference this is it,"This book is not a textbook in the traditional collegetext mode, but can take a practicing engineer through thebasics of A/D to a particular application. I have it on myshelf and when I need to know a particular issue about A/Dperformance and what engineering tradeoffs are involved ina particular design, this is the starting point. It naturallyis heavy on Analog Devices chips and solutions, but it givesthe astute engineer insight into the utility of the variousmetrics in a given chip's data sheet. It also can give cluesinto what metrics can be misleading depending on how theirtests are setup (This is probably more critical). I have thethird edition and it doesn't cover delta-sigma A/D convertersadequately"
1,Disappointed,"My disappointment is not toward the product in general , but towards the particular product I received.I have been using this particular pen for a long time and absolutely love it. However, the pack of 12 I received from amazon contained 12 pens- all of which had dried up.I hope it was a one-off thing from amazon and I was unfortunate enough to receive a faulty product.I recommend the pens though -- just a lesson that even products received directly from amazon.com can sometimes be faulty."
4,Expired but works well.,"The expiration is clearly stated on the back bottom part of the bottle BY1H033110, but they works well, and I don't feel my scalp was itch or anything."
1,lithium ion computer battery a dud,"Li-Ion Battery for Dell Inspiron 8500, 8600 SeriesNot this exact battery--I couldn't find an option to review the battery I received for my inspiron 700m. Suffice it to say, it worked for a couple of times, then I got a message that my computer didn't recognize the battery and it would no longer recharge. It looks and fits just like original equipment, but won't charge. My old battery still works fine, just doesn't last as long as when new, so it's not my computer."
3,Two Pound Indian Clubs Review,I consider this product of fair rating. I would suggest that the productbe made out of a harder wood or other material. My reason for this sug-gestion is that I have noticed the clubs seem to dent and crack to easily. Making them out of a harder material would correct this potentialproblem.
3,"A refreshing approach, but underplayed","There are so many bargain two-fers of the Brahms symphonies, including stupendous readings from Karajan, Walter, and Toscanini, that price issn't the attraction here. Nor is orchestral finesse and power: the Vienna Sym. was a woebegone ensemble for decdes and manages to sound good here but no better. The real attraction has to be Sawallisch's insights into Brahms.His main notion is that Brhams should sound lean, brisk, and fresh, much the same approach Sawallishc took in his notable recordings of Schumann for EMI. This is Brahms for springtime. As such, it's quite pleasant, but Sawallisch lacks conviciton, and where the music struggles and strives, he relaxes the tension too much. Even so, within its limits this is a pretty good listening experience."
4,Nice change from the usual rock bands,"If you, like me, are sick and tired of listening to generic bands, this is a good CD to pick up. These guys have real talent, the songs are extremely heartfelt and it's a great CD to chill out to. I would definately recommend this to anyone that likes originality and just plain out good music. :)"
1,Not so talented,"So a librarian (or someone) who never reads romances created a genre list for libraries to have and included this author (though my local library didn't have that particular book, so I took out another one) Well unless this book was vastly misrepresentative, the original list maker was way off the track. This book was both cookie cutter and fundamentally boring. There was no romance, sparkle or passion. It was tedious with cipher characters and nothing interesting or remotely unpredictable happening. You compare this to Loretta Chase's Not Quite a Lady, or Lisa Valdez' Passion (which had a hero who was already engaged, and that was so emotionally wrenching!) and it falls with a thud."
4,"Three quarter time music, good most of the time.","Mauceri and his Hollywood Bowl Orchestra play this music (most of which should be very familiar to them) with a great deal of flair. It's good to have the rare screen music, by some of the best Hollywood composers, made available apart from the movie soundtracks. The Broadway waltzes are probably more familiar. Classical waltzes such as the haunting little waltz from 'Cinderella' (Prokofiev not Disney) and Ravel's 'La Valse' also fare well at the hands of these musicians. The only one who suffers, somewhat, is Strauss ... and that is mainly the fault of Tiomkin's 'arrangements' of these all too familiar waltzes which might be a bit jarring to anyone who knows and loves them. The sound is perfectly adequate to display this music to its fullest."
1,I can't even explain how bad this stupid thing was,It was made with such cheap material and really looks nothing like the picture. Save yourself the money and buy something else.
2,Simplistic in nature and not very insightful or useful.,"Although this book is written on a subject not easily found in libraries, this book is too simplistic in nature and lacks sophistication. It reads more of a ""Reliability for Dummies"" and less like a technical or educational reference book."
2,sarong review,"Liked the overall look of this sarong. Beautiful beading and sequins, however, When I opened my package, there was a large waterspot in the center and a smaller stain of some kind on it as well. I had it drycleaned and the water spot came out but the smaller stain didn't. Also, wished it came with instructions on how to use it."
4,Great Product,"On first inspection, I loved the sarong. After further inspection, I discovered a small hole in it, much like that of what a cigarette burn hole would look like. I do not smoke, nor does anyone in my house, so it could not have been added by me. Even with that minor impairment, the sarong is still beautiful. I love the beading and also enjoy the fact that part of the purchase price goes to a good cause."
2,50% of this book is NOT USB information,This book provides a good overview of USB but I was disappointed to find that the appendices began when I was half way through the book. The entire 2nd half of the book is tables of information which has no connection to USB. Tables like Sony's CD ROM header pinout and the NuBus 90. I think the authors ran out of time or material and the publisher made the book look bigger by including all this extra doo-dah. There is nothing in the book's description on-line or on its covers that would let you know that it is 50% USB and 50% filler. I felt a bit ripped off.
1,Good pinouts on lots of connectors. None on USB.,"You buy a book on USB. Why pinouts on phone jacks,RS-232, printer connectors, ect. BUT NONE ONMALE OR FEMALE ""A"" or ""B"" CONNECTORS. GOOD PICTURES. BUT NO ""USB"" PINOUTS."
1,I don't trust it,My star rating might be unfair to the product. The product is watery whereas the the scar gel samples I received from a plastic surgeon's office were thick and went on like a protective coating. The Spenco Scar Gel didn't inspire my confidence. The location of my scar (on my face) and the watery consistency of the 'gel' resulted in my regretting purchasing the product even though it was less expensive and had good reviews.
1,Useless Product...,"I ordered this because I have a recent piercing scar and was hoping to heal it. I can say that I applied it several times a day and it made no difference at all in the appearance. I bought it because of the positive reviews and have since learned that so many reviews for products here on Amazon are shills paid by the company and this has to be on of them. I mean I used it for several weeks DAILY and it is a small scar from a monroe piercing and there is NO DIFFERENCE at all, NONE. Try something else because this doesn't work."
5,This product really works!,"I recently had surgery and this product was recommended to me by a friend. Wow, it really works very well only after a weeks use."
2,broke out of the box,I've tried two orders of these and on both the top of the pump was broken out of the box. there's no easy way to dispense the product once it's broken.
2,Does not work for me,"I do not recommend this product. It is a waste of your money. Rather, try vegetable glycerin. Not only does it work, but it's cheap too."
1,very poor quality,"I took the pan out of its box and immediately noticed that the 7 pancake holes were not straight sided like usual. The holes were very shallow. I held the pan by the handle and turned it over to look at the bottom. The ""cast iron"" handle snapped off and the pan fell to the floor. Back it goes!"
3,Factory damaged but alright product,I'm a little disappointed with this product. It arrived in around 8 days which wasn't too bad. The pan has three good sized marks in the surface that looks like they were done with a grinder of some kind. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that this won't affect my ability to flip the pancakes without them getting stuck and ripping. Ok transaction but not the best.
4,Plain and simple just a good Seether CD,If you are a true Seether fan or just like a couple of their songs or if you are just a fan of acoustic music you will not be disappointed with this CD my only complaint with this CD is I wish it was a full length live album when I buy live music I enjoy hearing everything like the segments where the band just talks on stage and to the fan it just goes into each song one after another...also the dvd kinda bummed me out some of the special features are cool but the dvd concert is the same as the cd no extra songs so thats kinda a disappointment but owell still a great cd.
1,not recommended,Very disappointing recordings from the 70's. Some odd choice of tempo from Brendel; the Adagio Cantabile from the Pathetique seems to drag with heavy accompaniment while some passages of the Rondo are so fast that in combination with mediocre sound quality they lose clarity. The Andante of the Appassionata is spoiled by an urgency rendering the final Allegro movement relatively less dramatic. Also the subjects in the Allegro do not sing out as they could - just listen to Barenboim's recording. Not recommended even if you are on a tight budget. Try Barenboim or Ashkenazy.
5,Most unique country band out there,"You will be hard pressed to find a band as origional. Points of intrest are the hilarious ""Product of disfunction"" and ""three cool guys"""
2,Handle slips,"I was so excited to get this, but the handle turns when you mash things (we like to use it to make guac).Very disappointed"
1,It's not techno (nor good music),"I bought this album believing that the ""tecno"" it speaks of would mean dance-oriented remakes similar to stuff Klone Records and some of the minor dance labels are producing. Wow, was I wrong. I describe it as thus:1. Find a bad studio band and underpay them so they are even less motivated.2. Create the same new wave tracks without any flavor or style change.3. Record the entire session in a subway tunnel on a two track recorder.4. Release the album via Mexico ensuring my new aggression of NAFTA.5. Cost me sleep at night as I realize this is $10 I'll never see again.Well, I took a chance and lost. If you're looking for techno remakes, stick with established labels like Klone, ZYX and Radikal."
4,Prismacolor Art Markers,"The daughter required this exact type of marker for her design class at college. She had been buying the individual markers at the student book store, but they were expensive. Although still not inexpensive, the set was a real bargain compared to the individual prices. She is ecstatic about the markers. They are excellent quality, and having the 24 separate colors allow her much more creativity in her college work. He classmates are jealous of her new set of markers. Good quality, good buy"
2,One Man's Journey,"I sent this book to a friend when he was diagnosed with squamous cell. He did not like it. He said it was very specific to that particular patient. To be fair, he only gave it 50 pages."
4,Cool but no punk,"The album is quite cool but why the hell ""Planet Punk""? It is the only Aerzte-cd on which there are really NO punk-songs. I suggest buying ""Die Bestie in Menschengestalt"" and ""Das Beste von kurz anch frueher bis Jetzte""."
3,good for a kid,I bought this little cartoon paperback for my grandson. When I asked him what he wanted & he said 2 of these little books. I checked with his mother first because I didn't know what they were & she said fine. They are just cartoon. He's a young teenager.
5,great book,"My son loves this book! The school has it in their classroom library. He was very happy that we were able to find it here, in very good condition and cheap!!"
3,Kinda Soggy,"Not as much interest in this book as the others in the series, this is more activity oriented than reading entertainment as the other books in the series."
2,written in,"did not know it had been written, good news I was able to erase all the writing before giving it to Jack"
4,Encouraged my son to read,"Although this isn't a great work of literature by any means.....it encouraged my 1st grader to read! He had to get everything Dave Pilkey wrote. He read all summer long! He's in 2nd greade now and has moved on to chapter books, but every once and a while the Captain Underpants books come off the shelf again!"
4,Mostly background material?,"In 1957 this was a going thing?But a lot has been dug up on the civilizations involvedincluding aerial photography of Nazca desert figures.The glossary of Spanish and Quechua words is very usefulas is the history of the different surviving sites.He says that there is evidence of pre-Clovis people in South America well before it was accepted by the mainstream. The oceanic route to the new world seemed only remotely possible at the time,but seems to have gained a lot in even the last five years.The Inca were a bronze age culture and if the Spanish hadn't arrived,might in the near future have clashed with the Aztecs?I'm glad to have this book for reference."
3,NOT comfortable for bare ankles.,Great products if you dont mind having chaffing burns around your ankles after a run in shorts and low socks. Great if you wear your compression socks.
2,"Labeled ""Leg Bands"" but FAR TOO SHORT for Legs","The card is labeled ""Reflective Leg Bands."" One of the bands is not even long enough to wrap around my upper arm. I don't have the problem of loose Velcro that other reviewers have noted, but it takes using both bands of the pair stuck together to be long enough to wrap around one leg. One band might be long enough to reach around the leg or upper arm of a small child. No way is it long enough for the leg or upper arm of an athletic adult in good shape. The good thing about this product is its very bright reflectivity. If the bands were longer, I would rate them 5 stars."
1,Velcros bad with time,"Lost one right away since the velcro did not hold. Great idea, just not a great execution."
1,Terrible...,"Trying to remove these from the package the velcro fell completely off, as it was not sewn on properly/securely. Very flimsy. Seem to be fairly reflective, but due to the poor quality, we would not buy these again. Still looking for a better alternative for night-time dog walking..."
4,Work just fine!,I tried another brand before this one. I like these much better because they are reasonably well made and are just the right size and provide a nice sized reflective surface. I would rate them a 5 if they helped me climb faster.
5,Reflective Bands by Jog-A-Lite (pair),Good sturdy well made product. i tested them in the dark. They are highly reflective. i bought them for night bicycling.
2,Where is this awesome shoes the reviewers are raving about?,"I intend to change my review later after I break them in.As of right now, they're only pretty on the outside.On the inside they feel tight even though I ordered a full size larger to avoid that. Theres also an astonishing lack of cushioning on the inside. The tounge is the thinnest I've ever got on a sneaker before. It makes me wonder where in the hell did the $65 go into making this shoe.The tounge also likes to venture on its own and slip to the side of my foot. I guess I underestimated the usefullness of the tongue holds on my old pair of shoes because I went well over 2 years without having to tie them once, while these shoes seem to demand that I constantly need to reshift them. I'm scared that the lack of cloth padding on the inside is going chafe and blister the back of my feet.I hope these end up being as comfortable as the reviews say. I'll re-edit my opinions in a month or more."
4,A nice classic shoe for casual wear,"The adidas Gazelle is one of those shoes you buy for a weekend afternoon to wear along with your softest jeans and most comfortable shirt. They look really nice in person, and offer a bit more arch support (and heel height) than many other ""old school"" retro shoes - but are still a low heeled shoe when compared to modern running and basketball shoes. Insoles are non-removable, so you can't upgrade the fit.These are slightly narrow and slightly long for their given size. The extra length appears to be due to the rounded shape of the toe box - from experience these will just be a hair long - but not like a well known popular canvas retro shoe where you need to fall back in size.Overall I'd buy another pair without hesitation, and recommend them to a friend."
2,Not too comprehensive or detailed.,"While the book is well written, it gives no knowledge to the real estate investment game. It seems more like a build up to get the readers interested in what they may succeed at, with his instructions. In other words, just another sell for his on going training. Save your money and watch the infomercial. It's about the same information and interviews."
2,Doesn't stand up to weather and water very well,"The PLCD16 seemed like a nice player at first. It sounded fine, and I really liked the Weather band feature. Then, we took the boat with us up to camp last year where we had some rain overnight and the next morning the Pyle would not play. This is a MARINE unit, right? Designed to be around water?? Hmmm... anyway I dried it out as best as I could, it still would not play. It was still under warranty so I sent it in for a look. The repair center said it had gotten wet but since it was under warranty they sent me back a new detachable faceplate. After that I was very protective of it, never let it stay out in the boat overnight, and again it only lasted about two months before the radio portion of it completely quit one sunny morning. It still works as a CD player, but that's it. So, I'm currently in the market for a new unit but sorry to say it won't be this one again. Seemed like it should be a good value for the price, but I was wrong."
4,Marine radio works well on motorcycles,"Shipping was excellent, it arrived early and there were no problems. I installed the unit on a motorcycle and use the romote on the handle bars. Everything works great. I would like to have fade and balance control on the remote also the CD player is a little more sensitive than I would have thought for marine use but works well enough. Overall I give the experince high marks from start to finish. I will use Amazon again."
5,Optimal Patient Care,"Your nonverbal patient communication plays a critical role in the care you give to your patients. This book explains how to interpret nonverbal cues and how to use nonverbal techniques for more effective and humane patient care. Special attention is given to geriatrics, death and dying, and crisis intervention, new information is included on parenting, stress and anxiety, and the nursing process. -- from book's back cover"
5,Vis-a-Vis wet-erase markers,"I love these markers for cartooning and drawing. Felt-tip nib is flexible and gives great ink coverage and range of strokes. Affordable and a good value. I only use the black ones, but they do come in several colors including red, purple, blue, green."
5,Lovely Schubert,I bought this for one piece and one piece only- but have listened to the entire set many times. Beautiful music as only trios can be.
1,mis-labeled disc!?!,"I was so disappointed! Instead of the two B flat string trios + a piano trio on disc 1, it was a symphony! How did that happen? The disc label said trio, etc. but the music was symphonic! My only option was to return for a refund, not a replacement. Right now I am not really up to re-ordering & having the same thing happen again, sigh."
5,Excellent Collection,I would suggest that this compilation is very good indeed. I grew up listening to Perez on vinyl and this CD has several primo tunes from several of his very early 60s or late 50s albums. Couldn't agree less with the other review. Quality is high & the beats will get you dancin'!!
5,works for me,"I use Weckl nylons as well as other models-all vic Firth. Sticks are a personal preference though. For certain styles these are correct for me-the lacquer also is just right-no need for sanding, wax or other devices to keep the grip. Fairly durable for a thinner stick and good balance and rebound. But whatever model-I stick with VIC..."
4,Looks to be genuine Lenovo part,"I was concerned about getting some 3rd party battery but this seems to be the genuine article. I am using it for a Thinkpad W500.Original battery label said 7.8Ah. This battery says 7.14Ah. voltage is the same of course. Label also says, ""Manufactured for Lenovo - Cell origin, Japan - Further processed in China."" It has the 41++ mark on it. Seems to work OK but I have only had it for one day. No ""not Lenovo"" warnings come up in Power Manager. I don't know why the difference in ampere-hour ratings -- Maybe they simply became more honest? They added a watt-hour rating to the label and Power Manager reports it was, ""designed for - 84.24 Wh"" and the fully charged capacity shows, ""Full charge capacity - 86.73 Wh""I did a calculation just before finishing this review. 84.24Wh/nominal 10.8volts = exactly 7.8Ah not 7.14Ah. Oh well, I'm not too concerned about it since it seems to work OK."
4,Reliable markers,As one of the top sellers in professional markers it stands by its word. I have used them over and over for rendering projects and each time they seem to be new. They never seem to die or go dry like most markers. Prismacolor is a very reliable marker to have on hand. The only draw back of this great product is the price. As you see sets are very expensive and single markers match that tone. But amazon does a good job of lower the bite of the price. Overall with price the prismacolor markers are well worth the dent in the pocket compared to what else is out there.
1,Not professional quality playing,"I would avoid this set, despite its price and the fact that it includes all the Songs without Words. Alpenheim is simply not a professional quality pianist and was likely only recorded because of her husband, the great conductor Antal Dorati. Alpenheim doesn't have the technical proficiency or range of textures one would expect from a first-rate pianist but what is most annoying is her inability to shape the music's melodic line into an expressive whole. Look elsewhere."
4,GOOD,This boxing gloves are very good for the price and they look cool i use then almos very day with my reflex bag
4,Very Informative and Engaging,"To start, one of the most intriguing things about the book that caught my eye was its title ""The Workout"" in all caps and it's all black background. When you open up and start to read you immediately realize that this is a book written by someone who knows strength fitness and health and that he knows what he is talking about.The book is not lacking in the support of several well-known and famous people: Sylvester Stallone, Jennifer Lopez and Mike Tyson. Celebrity support notwithstanding, overall, ""The Workout"" is a good book and should be a welcome addition to anyone's fitness library."
3,"The low price is an attraction, but...","I bought this 2-CD set because it was onsale..... Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed when I played it. The selection itself is good, it contains the complete Etudes, En blanc et noir, and some other not-so-famous works. However, the performance is no match to the scope. You know that it was played in accordance with the composition, but beyond this you don't feel touched by the playing. I am still enchanted by Debussy's unique style, and will still buy CDs of his music, however I might look for something by other performers."
2,Disappointment,"I thought that this was a remake of the Sega Genesis version, but no. The storyline is about the same but no complex missions or character mods. Spontanious buy mistake is what it was."
4,Shadowrun...not that bad,"I don't care about graphics and animations if the gameplay is good, and the gameplay in Shadowrun is great. However, since it is only multiplayer, there really should be more maps and game types. There are only three game types.Also, the way games are gathered is the same as in Halo 2, which I hate. One should have the ability to post a game, and people can join whatever type they want. If someone wants to play one map or game type over and over, they should be able to. You can sort of achieve this in setting your game preferences, but it's really not the same as being able to see a list of games, and make your own choice.It was worth the $30 I paid, but I wouldn't pay more than that, and sort of wish I'd just rented it for two weeks."
2,Shadowrun,"I realize that many people have stated that you should research a game before buying it but unfortunately my ""research"" was limited to what was on the back of the box. What I saw said ""1 player"" and ""2-16 multi-player""I made the mistake of assuming that like Halo, the game had a solo storyline mode. Hours of training with a very poor AI for the game controlled players make for a boring experience. If you want to try this I suggest you find a bunch of friends willing to also. Otherwise,steer clear. Luckily I only paid $13 for it."
2,Meh...,"I was hoping for more of a role-playing game akin to the table-top fantasy game this is based on. Unfortunately, this is just another shooter."
1,A great disappointment.,"I have a couple of renditions of this music. I read on the net that this was a ""sonic blockbuster"". It is..sonically. The recording and mastering is superb. BUT the interpretation, rendering, and performance is this music is DISMAL. Unexciting, and booring. I really wasted money on this one. THis one is going to the used cd shop to trade in. I strongly do NOT recommend this CD."
5,"EXCELLENT, THE BEST TASTE SIMILAR TO A RESTAURANT","This Teriyaki Rice taste like the rise you buy at a Chinese restaurant or even better. I was skeptical to purchase it on line because of expiration date. But no regrets, it has a 1yr expiration. Love this product and will buy it again once I finish it."
5,Powerhouse,"Earland isn't as well known as most of the Blue Note and Verve organists who came to prominence in the 1960s and early 70s, but I think he should be. ""Black Talk!"" is certainly top shelf stuff. His versions of ""Aquarius"" and the eleven-minute workout on ""More Today than Yesterday"" are positively oozing with funky energy and dynamics. If you are a fan of funky jazz organ, this album is an absolute MUST!"
5,Distinct Funky Organ sound,"Every jazz organist has his/her (shirley scott) sound. Where as Jimmy Smith brought over the bop, Larry young, the modal and post-bop, Jack mcduff the single-lined piano styled gospel blues fun, groove holmes, the solid basslines, lonnie smith the pure funk, jimmy mcgriff the funk blues, etc. Charles earland carved out his own sound. On this album and pretty much all his others (save a few commercial ones from the 80's) he brings his own distinct flavor to the organ. Not only is his soloing exceptional, but the types of changes/progressions he uses, or the way he approaches/arranges each song make it really groove. Like another reviewer said, it doesn't feel like another 50's rhythm and blues jam, it is updated and sophisticated without being watered down.After enjoying this check out ""intensity"" it's very similar. Also don't forget to check out his excellent underrated releases in the early to mid 90's. They groove just as hard."
3,nice,"I liked it. I'm a pat fan. It doesn't have funny tracks like the past albums, but thas prolly a reflection of his emotions after getting out of jail.But it took me a long time to realize how great an entertainer Project at truly is. This album is angry. The streets will love it."
3,"From a teacher's perspective...great idea, bad translations in this one.","As another reviewer stated, this book has some incorrect word translations - I used a permanent marker and corrected mine, because I love this series for classroom use and for my own children - the theme goes along great with Lesson 6 in our Flip Flop Spanish workbook. Each book is wonderfully put together - I just wish she had used a little more thought in word choice.Sra. GoseAuthor of Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 1 & Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 2"
5,This whole series is wonderful,"I have been using this entire series with my son since he was born, and he is now 14 months. He loves the pictures and turning the pages. The books use the format of one word per page and it gives both the English and Spanish form of the word. This is a great series for early language acquisition."
3,not pretty but functional,"I use this at full extension with a 28 mm lens on a 1.5 crop DSLR. It is not pretty: it is actually quite utilitarian looking. I have had issues with rubber hoods splitting at the hinging points, so I do not fold it. As a generic thread-on, it can not be attached backward on the lens for storage. It is soft enough to pack loose with a lens without worry."
2,NOT a key for ID use.,"""Definitive""----???? NO WAY! This book has nice pictures but in no way is it good for identifying trees. There are many better ID books out there. Keep looking if you need an easy to use ID key."
2,Good music But Lucas Butchered it,"I saw the film last night = great film. the music i have not gotten the cd yet. i wanted to though very much. From the day this cd came out I have read many reviews about the score and how its layed out its the same as TPM but this time this film music is butchered by the directer - not John Willams. In past Williams scores sure you got a few selected cues from the film but those were not butchered up like this. From what I have listend to so far that its a mix of ""ACROSS THE STARS"" and an action cue or it just sounds the same. But if I were you I would wait for the 2 cd set and if you have not gotten the 2cd set of TPM I would get that other then this and have that to hold you over."
4,5 for the recording; 3 for its completeness!,"How can one review a recording that one has not heard? Well, as the glad owner of all previous musical contributions to the ""Star Wars"" saga, this reviewer can assert that the composition is, without a doubt, superbly crafted, executed, and presented. However, after the initial soundtrack to ""The Phantom Menace"" was released incomplete, with a follow-up one more detailed, I know that a ""fuller"" one is a few months away.I'll just anxiously wait for it!"
3,Warning it has copy protection on it!,"I tried the CD at home in my DVD player and my CD system and it worked perfect.I have now tried it on two different PCs and different software playersand all do the same thing,Track 13 plays fine for about half way to 2/3s then starts breaking up real bad.And track 8 isn't even listed.I read on another message board, and on Amazon.co.uk site, that it is copy protected.No warning on the CD anywhere. Sence I play most of my albums on a PCthis is no good. I am going to return the CD..."
3,"John, what's happening??","I love John Williams, but his last two SW scores have really been low points. I found a lot of the music in TPM to be loud and over the top! This music in this one is good, but once again is over the top and this soundtrack really dissapoints. It doesn't contain all the great music that was in the movie, the dark themes of both anakin and the emperor, or the new Count Dooku theme. It's all missing! I'd wait for a much more complete addition to come out before buying this one!"
2,Nothing new....,"I was rather disappointed listening to John William's latest Star Wars score. Nothing in the cd stands out as memorable or original. Williams use of drum solos in the chase sequence echoes Tan Dun's Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon soundtrack but it never achieves originality. The Love theme sounds like a variation of Williams' theme to Harry Potter, and I swear at one point he just lifts part of his own score to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The only exciting moment on the CD is when Yoda's Theme and the Imperial March start up, both of which we've all heard before."
5,SW Attack of the Clones original soundtrack,Powerful music. As always John Williams is brilliant! A must for every Star Wars fan.
4,Very unique!,"My favorite song on this album was 'karkee' which was #9! I first heard it on tv, they were playing it on the music channels. I thought that it had the most unique sound to it so I decided to check the soundtrack out. The rest of the songs were pretty good too! Overall I would recommend this soundtrack to people who like Moby and the Chemical Brothers."
3,Christmas Jazz CD,"I wish it was a little bit more Jazzy, but there are some good songs and different from the mainstream ""Pop"" music you hear on the radio now-a-days. artist include Louis Armstrong, Jimmy McGriff, Duke Ellington, Anita Moore, Dick Wellstood, Frank Sinatra, Fats Waller, Babs Gonzales, & Dick Hyman. Anita Moore's I'll be home for Christmas rendition is probably the best I ever heard! I don't regret buying this CD."
3,Eh?,This album was not too bad but it isn't all that great. Maybe 3 or 4 songs are actually catchy and something you would want to listen to over and over. Menos El Oso is probably the best album by Minus The Bear.
4,"great book, but has limitations","This book was wonderful. Since it takes you step by step you really learn instead of just being buried. But if doesn't cover everything. For example, there is almost nothing on the subjunctive. Does anyone know of a book that completely covers advanced topics, with lots of exercizes and an answer key?"
1,DONT BUY THIS WARRANTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased this extended warranty a year ago and thought it would cover what it claimed to cover. This july I was on a trip to India where the temperature's were extreme up around 120 degrees. After a day out in the sun, I noticed my camera's LCD screen had broken w/o any drops or impacts. When I tried to have it fixed through my NEW extended warranty they said it must have been accidently dropped or abused. When I told them where I had been and how hot it had been they basically told me I was out of luck and they had to assume it had been abused. They argued that the sun could not even do that to the camera and even told me how the camera is not under direct sunlight if it is in your hand. (Still can't figure that one out) Anyway be cautious when buying this extended warranty. Customer service was hostile and very hard to deal with. So if you feel like wasting your money on this company who won't back up their word...go ahead."
2,Never got it,How I wish I could review this video buti never got it there seems to be no space provedProvided for complaints!
2,"Fine product, but no Glove Lube","I just received this product for my son's new baseball glove. I opened the easy open packaging, unrolled the ""Glove Locker"" and nothing else came out of the package. There was NO Glove Lube as the description states. Nothing like having a stiff new glove, a ball and a wrap, but nothing to soften the leather with. I just considered this to be a novelty type item. Rubber bands have always worked perfectly fine for us for years. I ran out of leather conditioner and thought I would get it at Amazon, saw this fancy little thing, saw it came with some conditioner and went for it. Now I still couldn't use this 'kit' to get my son's glove ready. Disappointing. The wrap works fine and seems to hold the mitt nice and tight with the ball inside to form the pocket."
4,Decent Walking shoes,"I would surely purchase another pair of Palladium shoes. These are soft and comfy, and completely lined in leather so they are fairly durable. When I first tried them on, the right shoe pinched a bit, but being leather, they stretched to fit my foot after some wear."
2,Shrek Doll,I purchased this doll for my daughter for Christmas. I received the doll which stated it was 12 inches but turned out only to be 6 inches. I am not very satisfied!
4,Little Miss Gumshoes,"Hard to find book on the ""DARK"" side of everyones favorite teenage sleuth. Full of great insights on clues, payoffs and mistakes. A must for ND fans."
3,Nice song selection but MONO only.,"This is another example of neglect in regard to remastering. The people at Universal Music/Spectrum in the UK chose to include in this collection the MONO singles only. There are no stereo songs on this CD. If Motown or whomever is putting this stuff out, they should print the mono/stereo information on the cover so that the buyer can know what he/she is buying."
2,"I have seen good quality software, mediocre software, poor quality software and ""Roxio Easy CD & DVD"".","It is easy to install, but other than that, this software doesn't offer anything good. If you are lucky, you may be able to burn some CD's and DVDs (at least once in a while).I was able to burn a couple of DVDs (just data, nothing fancy), but have a lot of trouble using it for anything else, the user interface is one of the worst I have seen; overall the experience using this product is quite poor.Believe me, it is not worth the $30 dollars I paid for it. If you get it for less than $5 in a bargain bin or as a gift, give it a try, it and make it work for you; otherwise save your money and get something better."
1,Constant Problems,"I thought my computer(s) were the problem, pc's, with my burned DVD's not working about half of the time until I read these reviews and know it's the software. Not a good buy in my opinion. Will be finding new software as soon as I finish this review."
1,Barebone Functionality,If you want the very basic functionality then this is the product for you. But you can achieve this with Windows built-in features also why pay money for a product. Unfortunatley I found out after buying.The installation and using the software was very straight forward and without any problems.
3,Easy CD & DVD trial version?,"I bought this software from one of the large warehouse stores in the area two years ago. Used it for mp3's,vcd's,dvd slideshows. Worked fine. Just purchased a usb turntable to convert my vinyl to mp3 and cd, went to load easy cd & dvd and I get this message : trial version has expired. I was unaware that this was a trial version because nowhere on the box does it say trial version.I am very disappointed."
1,Problems....Problems...Problems,I bought this software to copy my mini DVDS. After installing I got error message after error message.....it kept needing to update the directory. The software did start working at this point. It copies the DVDs just fine but I cannot burn a new DVD. I have the same problem as a few people have already mentioned before. It does not recognize my DVD burner...NEC. I attemtped to contact their support and also learned its not supported (although I just bought it). I called NEC and my DVD burner is working and the driver is up to date so the problem is the software. I would stay clear.
2,No good for me,Loaded this product and played around with it for a few minutes. Seemed much easier to work with than the other burner software I had used.All ready to go and then it wouldn't recognize my cheapo Emprex burner. I followed all the tips on tech support (except for editing my registry) with no luck.I'm guessing it would be a good product with a decent DVD burner; but I sure can't say.
2,Unhappy student camper,"At first, I was delighted. Yes, this textbook had writing throughout the margins. Yes, a lot of the review questions were already answered right in the book, but I figured that it was cheap so what could I expect. But I think that if a bookstore buys back used textbooks, maybe having all the review questions answered inside the book isn't a book you should try to sell. The worst part, though, was discovering that whole chapters were actually missing from the book. I've calculated that close to 100 pages have actually been physically removed from the book, some back to the binding making them hard to see until you are reading/studying along and the next page you turn to makes absolutely no sense. Then you find out that a bunch of pages are missing and that you are now reading from the middle of the next chapter. I would not recommend this seller since the book looks OK from the outside, but has cost me more time than the price savings bought me."
5,read my comment here,I understand the authors vies of being paraniod about free readers. I get that his following is upset too. But this area is to praise and worship Silverberg at his altar in the church of childrens dreams. If all this is too ambiguously esoteric for you to give this deserving man a four or five then smoke some weed and reread it again. Your paranoia will drift off with the smoke and you can think back to when you were a child and your heat ran wild with imagination and creativity. This is spiritual to let the good times take over the bad so enjoy and share the love. Peace Out
4,"Very helpful, with a few bugs.","I found this software to be very helpful in writing my resume and cover letter. It walks you through the entire process, and even gives you sample bullets/phrases, customized for your target job. The software does have a couple bugs though; 1. It keeps asking me to insert my Dell Picture Studio CD, for no apparent reason. 2. When I tried to submit my resume online, the software would not download updates, and I was forced to put my available date as October 2005! Not good. Also, I emailed tech support for help, and never received a response."
4,Great tool,"I've used this product repeatedly for myself and for family members. It helps drive a good resume format, aids in building variety into vocabulary and phrasing choices, and makes creative editing for size, etc. easier."
4,Good Resume Writer,"This is an out standing software program, and the company filled the promptly. I am pleased."
5,Oh great!,"TVparty! is definitely my kind of book! From front to back, I liked the fresh attitude and the depth of knowledge. These were stories about the early days of TV that I didn't know. And any book that has Brett Somers and Paul Lynde is well OK with me.I also liked the mysteries like the Death of George Reeves and what happened to all those sitcom houses. Captain Kangaroo! Winky Dink! This is television obscura, groovy too!"
1,Don't waste your money on time,"There are very few books that I have purchased in which I have felt swindled. TV Party has come as close as you come to this.In short, while the book is visually appealing, that is as deep as the book gets. Paying twenty dollars for one or two interesting stories is not my idea of a book that delivers. Whether you are a nostagia hound or not, it would be best if you passed on this book. If you still want to try it out, make sure that you can get your money back before you make the purchase!"
5,Continuing On,"So, the saga continues of the future without God and it being a crime to worship him. What happens next?"
3,Not a bad read,"Okay, the plot seems extreame but the story makes for fun reading. A man stuck in a world that has outlawed faith and infact he works directly for the governing powers that uphold the outlawing of religion. He finds himself at a crossroad as he learns more about the people and their faith that he had swarn to silence."
1,Won't buy the third in the series,"Gave this series a second chance, but the characters are pretty one-dimensional, and the story line just doesn't grab me. Read this one and Tim LaHaye's second in his series, one after the other, and this one is truly lacking something. Won't buy the third book."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I am very disppointed with this toy. It is not as decribed. It is much bigger that I expected. My biggest compaint is that from the pictures it appears that when the head is pulled it stays up as it shrinks back into the hole, but that is not what happens. The head falls over and doesn't stay out. The legs are also a problem. They don't really ""Pull out"". Also the toy came without working batteries. All I can say is save your money!"
2,Cute but not made well,My daughter has had this horse for 3 weeks and it already has two holes where the seams came apart. She only sleeps with it- so it's not like it's had a lot of wear and tear either. Seems like they didn't use enough stitches per inch when sewing (probably to save money) and so the seams come apart easily.
5,It's King for a reason,We use these to write on cardboard boxes for shipping. We've gone through dozens of different brands. These last much longer than any other permanent markers we've tried. We only buy these for our company.
3,"A beautiful, tasteful book with very few new project ideas","This book has some lovely photography and the decoupage is beautifully crafted, but the projects have all been offered many times before from other sources.As an experienced crafter, I was disappointed in the lack of new ideas for projects in this book."
5,Magnifique!,"This book shows you how live. And live it to the full. After years of disapproval heaped on her by her husband, Mary, a violinist, is finally free to live the life she always wanted. Since his passing, she embarks on a trip to Paris to track down her first love. Will she find her French seaman? Or are the odds too great? This excellent heartwarming book will warm your soul."
1,Misleading Title,I was hoping to dive into this book and find proposals on what to do about all the Mexicans that have poured into this country due to our God-given prosperity but instead the author delves into a boring story of buildings in 1950's New York and rental rates.Verdict: Boring and irrelevant.
2,Taco Rice,"I found this one rather bland and dry, like most Mexican rice. The salsa I added was an improvement. For the same money I could buy a pound of rice and toss in some chili powder or taco seasoning, so I can't really recommend it."
3,Corn Bread Sticks,Only one batch of corn bread sticks so far...with fair results. We didn't follow the instructions completely for seasoning the pan - so don't do what we did and cut corners!
4,"not helpful for food intolerances, at least in my case","I was hoping this product might give me relief from my food intolerance symptoms, which are brought on by a leaky gut (as far as I can tell from my research), but unfortunately this product does not seem to help at all with that in my experience, which is not a fault of the product, but I had read some reviewers state that this might be possible.If anyone has any advice for some products that *would* help, please leave comments on my review. Thanks! I am already taking colostrum and l-glutamine as well as digestive enzymes and George's Aloe Vera Juice to heal the leaky gut. Does anyone have any suggestions for what products would limit the symptoms as I heal?"
5,I simply can't believe it!!,"After years of getting spotty relief of allergy symptoms from over the counter allergy products, I stumbled over information for Quercetin. I am astonished at the relief of symptoms I get from this product. I'm a fan."
3,necessary for digital!,"I have found out from another reviewer this company is not reputable and refuses to disclose their terms and conditions in advance of purchase. don't waste your money buying from this third party, but instead get the camera from your local store and buy their warranty. Or, if you buy online, Ritz and Wolf will allow you to buy their warranty at the store level within 30 days of the camera purchase if you bought it from their website. A good extended warranty will cover, at a minimum, an annual cleaning which is very necessary for digital equipment. Just remember ... you usually get what you pay for!PS: the screen won't let me change the star rating. It's stuck on 3, I'd give this particular vendor 1 or none for being untrustworthy."
5,Excellent Product,"I've taken this 7-keto supplement for the past six months along with 5-htp,50 Grams (1.77 Oz) 5 HTP Griffonia Seed Extract Bulk Powder. Besides losing ten pounds over this time, which doesn't sound like a lot but believe me it's huge, I also have been able to maintain a steady level of energy, been sleeping better, and have had not felt depressed since I began this regiment. I know this may not sound great to anyone but for me it's been amazing. I've suffered from insomnia the better part of my adult life, have always been lethargic and had low energy (even in those rare cases that I did sleep) and i've been diagnosed as clinically depressed more times than I can remember. I love these supplements and totally won't stop taking them any time soon!"
2,Yikes,Well I ordered this product with great anticipation after seeing it on the Dr Oz Show...I planned to use it as a weight loss supplement in addition to my fitness regime to lose 5 pounds. however 7-Keto was a bust for me as the side effects left me a bit jittery and feeling a bit out of sorts. However this doesn't affect everybody I 'd recommend you give it a try
1,:(,I eat well and exercise and am trying to loose last 10 pounds which feels impossible at this point. I really wanted to like it but it didnt help at all. I am a 5 foot 4 female who weighs 145 pounds. I am 1 pound from overweight status here.
1,Waste of Money,"Did nothing for me. Took as directed, felt nothing different. Did Not lose any weight. Just another Bogus DrOz sellout. Would NOT recommend."
3,No effect on me,"I took this on the advice of Dr. Oz. it's okay but nothing special in my opinion. I also take forskolin and cla. Once I run out, I will only stick with cla, since that had a real effect on me and results were immediate."
4,7-Keto,"Using this in conjunction with Forskolin. Throw in some exercise and a low carb diet, and I'm wearing a size smaller blouse. Hoping this continues."
1,Thanks for the Acne.,"Maybe this works for other people, andI slept a little better with this, but otherwise all I got was some nasty acne."
4,Helps me to stabilize my weight.,Since losing 30 lbs. 7-Keto helps me to keep my weight stabilized.I would recommend this product to anyone looking to lose weight.
2,Wasn't worth it...,"I don't normally do reviews, but had to on this one.. I have Epstein barr, which lends to Chronic Fatigue.. I am ALWAYS tired. I read so many people got so much energy from this, and really hoped it would work for me. NO such luck. good luck to everyone else."
3,The Cay,"The cay starts off slow,and meaingless but towards the middle it became adventurous and exciting.In this book you leaped for joy,laughed,and cried.I would recomend this book to somone who was looking for an adventurous book.:)"
4,4th of July Music,Put in this CD when you watch fireworks on the 4th of July. Nothing better than listening to Kate Smith sing God Bless America during the finale!!!
2,"Works, but cheaply made","The suit will make you sweat if that's what you are looking to do. I had rivers running out of my sleeves and pant legs, but the pants tore within weeks on the inside seam. I was using the suit about 5 times a week with a vigorous treadmill routine. It will likely last longer and be fine for occasional recreational uses, but buy something more substantial for a serious workout. You truly do get what you pay for."
2,not strong enough,"I was given this sauna suit as a Christmas gift. The bottoms split within two weeks of me using them. Thinking it was just me, I ordered another set and a set for a friend. Again the bottoms split within two weeks. I ended up using the set I brought for my friend, and within two weeks the bottoms split. As a sauna suit it does the job, you just have to lose all the weight you want to within two weeks..."
1,Slow,"This company is very, very slow getting out the product. So slow in fact, that Amazon actually cancelled the charge to my bank. The product just mailed today, and it was supposed to be here by ... tomorrow. The shipment will be at least a couple of days late. I have never had this problem with any other seller on Amazon, and hope to never have it again."
2,nope......,"The sheer virtuosity of this performance has been snatched away from us by one of Philips label's worst efforts. There is nothing to recommend about this release because of the botched recorded sound. The choral parts are often masked, the soloists seem like they're miles away from any microphone, the orchestra out of balance, simply a dreadful sound overall.I am a HUGE fan of Gardiner and his choral recordings but Philips did him a great disservice by not doing their homework for the acoustic in which this requiem was recorded.What's the point of having to strain to listen for the best details of a performance because the producer did such shoddy work in the first place? This review may seem out of whack compared to the others, but I'm sorry, I just can't understand how anyone has overlooked the poor quality of this disc's recorded sound.DON'T BUY!"
2,Good read,The story line was good. I can't say I would read it again. Though. This is the first book I've read from Tanya so I might give another a try
5,Works SO well.,"The box has a lot of the common practical colors.The pens write SO SO SO well. They don't make that scraping, running out of ink sound. All around awesome. And yea for magenta instead of yellow."
2,Cheap toy.,"I received the clock one day and returned it the next. It is poorly designed of cheap materials and the flimsy flip lid will have a short life. Absolutely not user friendly as there are numerous unnecessary steps to perform simple functions. On the other hand, the Sharper Image ""Travel Soother"" alarm is small, beautiful, built like a tank with spectacular sound and the dozens of functions can be quickly set in one or two simple touches of a button. By far the best travel sound clock radio I have ever seen. Quality is subjective and the Conair Sound Therapy Travel Clock Radio has met the requirements of a few."
4,"Very good, But....",I really like this clock radio. I am a sound sleeper with a severe hearing loss and wanted a travel clock radio so I could get a very loud wakeup call while on the road. I like the features of awakening to different sounds or a memo and listening to music or sounds. My only problem is that the AC adapter will not work on 220 volt systems found in Europe and Asia.
1,"I think Stephen King was referring to ""The Outter Limits""","I think Stephen King was referring to ""The Outter Limits"" when he made that quote ""the best horror series ever put on TV""Even Stephen King, in his book DANSE MACABRE (p. 216 of the oversized paperback), calls this ""the best horror series ever put on TV"
2,good when it works,"When it works this stuff is great. When it doesn't work however, both my wife and I had anxiety and racing thoughts. I've been unable to sleep for 48 hours after taking this once or twice, though I had messed up sleep patterns from working nights anyway."
2,A fun game IN THEORY,"In theory, this game should be very fun. However, it is very unstable and cheaply made. It is cheap plastic pieces and couldn't handle an eight year old and a six year old playing with it. Save your money."
1,Worst Purchase Ever,This was my worst purchase ever. Does not keep a connection well and does not stream video well. Much better options out there!
3,Old laptop gets upgrade,"Upgraded old laptop. Installation CD that came in sealed box with this new card was incorrect. It was for a USB wireless network adapter. A call to Belkin support solved the problem. Card seems to be very susceptible to interference from 2.4 GHz devices, but is giving good performance as long as the cordless phone doesn't ring."
1,Keep looking.,"It does not deliver. Range is so low do not bother. In this case ""N1"" stands for ""not this one."""
1,Worked... BRIEFLY,"I bought this at a BIG 5 sporting goods store and used it once at a ballgame in which it worked just right. I put it away for a week and took it out and it would not focus on anything more than 15ft away... I never dropped it, smashed it or anything... Be careful..."
1,Don't bother.,"Bought this at Big5 when it was on sale for 8 dollars. Not worth it. Got it home, took it out of the box and found that it won't focus on anything past 50 feet. Anything farther is noticeably out of focus regardless of setting the focus knob at it's farthest setting. Being that I bought this in hopes that I can use it for spotting targets at 100 yards, it is worthless. It will be returned, not replaced."
4,Good choice,"The Niv Application Study Bible is exactly what I needed, just wish the letters were bigger, but then I wear glasses."
2,A Big Disappointment,"I love alien invasion stories, but this one I had trouble completing. I kept hoping it would get better...it didn't. When the Footfall, well, ""falls,"" they spend almost no time describing it. This wouldn't be so bad if most of the book wasn't like this. There are also WAY too many characters, making the book hard to follow early on. One up is that the climax lasts for a while, giving you time to soak it all in. Unfortunately, this climax leads to the book's dissatisfying ending. I would recommend not buying this book; if you must read it, your local library or a friend would be the best place to get it from. Please note that this is only my opinion, and I mean no offense to those who enjoyed this book."
1,too many carboard cutouts,"I closed the book half way through when I had to admit I didn't care what happened to anyone in it. I know it's the accepted way to write a novel skimming over dozens of unimportant and unlikable characters, but I, for one, prefer a few characters portrayed with depth to many cardboard cutouts shuffled about rapidly in an attempt to substitute sleight of hand for substance. If you feel the same try any early Jack Vance orSisters of Glass."
1,THIS IS REALLY BAD,"I love all Larry Niven's books...Except this one. This is just bad. Jingoistic, simplistic, portrays the russians as mere cartoon characters, and the aliens are just so dumb. I just can't get over how bad it was. Incredible that a genius like Larry Niven wrote this boring piece. Pick any other book by Niven and you'll be pleasantly surprised...Just not this one."
3,Funny history of the computer industry,"Overall, I enjoyed an inside look at the history of how the computer industry got where it is today. Only a techno geek would like this book though. Luckily I happen to be one!"
5,I love these pens!!!,"I went to my mom's best friend's law school with her (she taught there) and, to my delight, was allowed into the staff office supplies room. Obviously, i began stocking up on pencils and pens (i always lose mine) for school. After using this blue Liquid Expresso pen at school, i immediatley fell in love with them and bought this pack for the new school year. i adore these pens!"
3,it was okay,"I have always like the Winans music but this CD was just ok. I only liked five songs out of the whole CD. ""Paradise"" is one of my favorites and has a very nice beat. ""Count it All Joy"" encourages you not to give up because God won't put more on you than you can bear. ""Smile on Me', another favorite, has a very nice beat. Universal Love, a very beautiful song and ""Standing on the Promises"", what can I say, one of the best songs on the album, an amazing beautiful song. I wasn't really feeling all the other songs, they really did not appeal to me. This CD was kind of a disappointment but those five songs made up for it."
3,It's baking paper,"what can I say, it's baking paper...I just wanted to try the unbleached variety, works like any other. We arent able to buy unbleached baking paper in New Zealand - not sure why"
4,=),I use these pens a lot! I love how they write and I love the colors they come in. The only thing I am not thrilled about is the price if they where a little cheaper I would never buy other pens.
2,not the best but pretty good,"it looked like a stupid gameboy game!!!!!!!!! I guess it was supposed to but seriously guys, it is out of date. Get the windwaker game. It was better than any zelda game.But in the windwaker game the character also gets a look of game boys. Stick to NFL Street 2. That was the best game ever."
5,Unglaublich Gut,"Ich habe die CD bereits seit einem Monat und kann sie JEDEM nur empfehlen! Da stecken wahre Gefühle drin, in den Songs wie auch in der Stimme. Ben Bledsoe ist ein wahres Talent nicht nur als Sänger sondern auch als Songwriter, was er mit diesem Album bestens zeigt, und Performer.WIRKLICH EINE CD DIE AUS MEINEM CD PLAYER NICHT MEHR WEG ZU DENKEN IST!!!"
2,Bought it and replaced it for a,"I've used this tub when my son was first born. The main reason why we bought it was to save space, but what we found is it really didn't save all that much space. I also found that is was not very sturdy to hold my son up because he kept slipping down on the tubular bottom. I found that I needed to use two hands to keep him safe in the tub, therefore had troubles washing him because I could not hold him sturdy with one hand and wash him with the other. It does not have a little compartment to hold your shampoo and soap, so you have to reach outside the tub and turn your head away from the baby. We switched to the First Years Sure Comfort Newborn to Toddler Tub and my son was better supported and has a great time splashing away."
5,If you haven't read do!,"I started reading the book on a saturday afternoon and was finished by that evening. I stoped only to use restroom and fix sandwich. Ben oh Ben was a excellent fictional character man of my dreams, didn't take crap from anyone. She was a strong female and like her very much, not a female/male type of women that a lot of these writers put into their books. I really recommend this book, but also have another one handy because you will finish this within a day. Good reading love Linda Howard's books."
2,Not a believable story,"I enjoy movies with an unrestrained Christian message, but they need to be believable. This is not. It is a typical, independent film that is focused on the message at the expense of a believable plot. Hardly anything in it could really happen, especially in a small, tight-knit community as in the setting. Order it from Netflix if you must; it's certainly not worth purchasing it."
4,A story about one leader who cared about tommorrow.,"Walth's biography on McCall's impact on Oregon is especially pertinent in a time where economic gain outweighs livability every time. Upon completing the book I found myself yearning for governors in other states to become outspoken defenders of livability. Virginia's beautiful coutryside is disappearing beneath a wave of McMansions, strip malls, and blacktop. Oregon is imperfect, but in a class by itself with respect to thinking about the land our grandchildren will inherit."
1,not worth the investment,"Ms. Aliberti, the soprano in this recording, is unsuited for the role. The voice is hard, lacking in any sense of bel canto style, and lacks flexibility. The other singers are adequate though nothing special. I would not recommend this recording, it is unsatisfying and misrepresents what is a wonderful opera."
2,they should have hanged this pirate,"alibertis'voice is beyond discription, with one exception. Ms aliberti has about three notes in her voice that sound just like maria callas, unfortunatly those are the only three good notes she has! The rest of the cast is a little less exciting"
4,Love it,"We like everything about it, but I do wish my baby could sit upright in it with some back support. It reclines bit much"
3,Exploring Mathematics,"The text in conjunction with the supplemental CD-ROM program teacher's guide is a useful tool to supplement the 4th grade math curriculum. The interactive CD-ROM program allows children to further explore mathematical concepts at all levels. The text serves as a useful guide in planning instruction and student intervention. The CD-ROM teacher's guide maps out skills to be mastered in conjunction with the student text.

1,A Very Strange Horror Film,"I purchased this by mistake, not realizing it was the Horror genre. The story centers around a video, anyone who sees it is doomed to die shortly.What a fine actress like Naomi Watts is doing in this movie is a mystery. But, even her presence cannot save this silly story."
4,Excellent album and great back cover!!!,"I love this album by Raimundos. They're a great band. Their music makes you feel happier and enthusiastic. I agree that ""Mulher de fases"" is one of the best songs in this CD. You won't regret if you buy it. Also, the back cover is like a gift for boys... :) Great back cover..."
1,Don't Buy!!,"My mom and I have been making these cookies since I was a little girl, and we lost our iron a few years ago. We decided to go with this product due to the price, but regret it every second. We got 6 cookies out of our recipe because the batter would not stick to the iron! I don't know if it's too hot, or not hot enough, but all I know is we tried EVERYTHING and were unable to get any more from this iron. Like I said, we've made these for about 25 years and never had a problem, so it's not like we don't know how to use it properly. Go with the more expensive one!"
1,bad bad bad,"This is my first bad review ever, this item is just horrible. You cannot use two molds at once since the prongs are too close together and they are impossible to fit. Since frying one at a time is very time conshming, i thought this gadget would be great......well NOT. I ended up using it just with one rosette mold. Bad construction... and no, you can just separate the arm to make room for both molds to be in place, husband also tried and it just will not work...."
4,"a good read, but not her best","This is a lighthearted fun book that I read in one sitting. As always I love how Mercedes Lackey can make characters so warm and lovable. However, this story is not quite what I expected after reading The Fairy Godmother. Definatly, a great twist on the typical fantasy book that takes itself way too seriously, but laking the heart most of Mrs Lackey's work posseses. I would recomend this book to anyone for a light poolside read."
1,Sent it back.,"Great idea - but it stopped working after 3 days. We replaced the battery - but it still didn't work. We sent it back. Also, we would have liked the ""giggle"" to be louder."
3,on scotties,"While the cover of this book appears to be dedicated to the beloved scottie, it gives very vague information as to the breed its- self. Much of the imformation is just general dog education. The photos were also of poor quality."
5,Great stuff!,"One day, I found this book lying around the house. Because I am part Norweigan and enjoy Noweigan music (Emperor, Dimmu Borgir), I thought I'd check it out. Three words describe the stories contained here: ""What a trip!"" There's rivers made of mestrual blood, hillarious insults (""Freja, you were caught in bed with your own brother and then you farted!""), and some very unexpected plot twists. The myths are very well explained and care has been taken to retain the ""oral history"" feel they've had for over a millenium. I don't read many books, but I can pretty much guarentee that this is worth your time. Buy it, check it out from the library, do whatever it takes to get it into your hands today and you won't be disappointed! Mr. Crossley-Holland has done an excellent job in making this ancient tales readable by modern people."
4,A Hilltop in Tuscany,"It was a great book! If you want to read it though, I would suggest reading the firrst one, A Garden in Paris. The book had a great mixture of all kinds of things, romance, drama, a little mystery. I loved it! Amazon shipped it really fast too! Read it!"
1,Pointless color,"The green ink of this pen is not typical pen-green ink but fluorescent green. It doesn't show up well on paper - think highlighter green. It's a shame because the ink flows smoothly, just a stupid color. I actually have a BIC pen that is the same exact color, and no use for that either. Too bad there wasn't a picture of the green pen."
3,Not Worth It,"The drills in this video are designed for players 14 yrs and up for the most part so if your looking for drills for players 12 and under, don't waste your money. Even if your looking for drills for older, experienced players, the quality of the video and the players in the video are not very good. It's basicly a home made video. I got a few drills for my U12 players from this but the price is WAY too high for video of this quality. It should be $9.99 so I feel like I wasted $20."
5,From a 22 year old,"This is by far the most used and best loved cookbook in my collection! My copy was originally my mother's, but when I moved out, she gave it to me- I used it almost every time I cooked dinner! The first time my now boyfriend of 3 years came over for dinner, I cooked him the Baked Parmesan Chicken- he loved it! I give full credit to that recipe for starting our relationship off on the right foot! I wouldn't trade this easy-to-use, all-level-friendly cookbook for any other in the world."
4,Understanding Bubba? Perhaps,"As a rule, I am scornful of books that attempt to psychoanalyze public figures from afar; indeed, I am skeptical about psychology in general. In this case, the author himself points out that his analysis should only be taken so seriously considering he has never seen the 'patient'. I am also dubious about the notion of 'syndromes' in general. Certainly Bill is a liar and a vacillator who denies personal responsibility, but are these traits really caused by the fact that his father was an alcoholic? So I came to the book a skeptic. That being said, I found the book very compelling. The most amazing thing about it is it seems to predict the Lewinsky scandal, and Clinton's reaction to it. Those that loath Bill Clinton will certainly enjoy it, and find it very convincing. Those that love him will dismiss it out of hand. Those who are in between will be very disturbed."
1,Beware not as advertised,This product is cheap. The shaker flip top is extremely flimsy. It was only attached on one side when I received the shaker. The worst feature is that it is covered in graphics advertising Optimum Nutrition. I bought it because the Amazon the picture showeed no graphics or printing. Very disappointing.
2,You get waht you pay for...,"I've had mine for just over 6 months, and it crapped out. My Heier lasted 6 years, and I wish I would have spent the extra money to buy one."
