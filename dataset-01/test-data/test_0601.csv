3,Caution!>>><<<GOOD GAME AT FIRST BUT THEN IT GETS OLD 13 YR,"WUTUP, representing CT! well, halo is an awsome game when you get it. at least i thought so. after playing it a few times i thought it was the best game ever. after being glued to that game for 48 hours, it gets OLD....really old....really really old! i suggest to buy this game used or buy it then sell it when your done....multi player is a diffrent storie....it [is good]. but that gets old to.....WARNING do not get SILENT HILL 2...that game sucks!"
2,You have GOT to be kidding....,"Eugh... I've seen better multiplayer FPSes on The PS1 and N64. The people who are giving this 5-star reviews have clearly not spent a lot of time with computer FPS games. Quite frankly, when you compare this game to T2 (another bungie game, can't say the full name on amazon,)it's trash. If you want a console FPS game, you're going to get one, and it's no better than any other on a console. (That is not good.) I strongly suggest you ignore this waste of CD's and buy some computer FPS games. Once again, I suggest you start with T2 which in and of itself is a much better game."
4,"fun, beat it a few times...","I loved the game, beat it twice with my friend Nic. but there was one thing that really stank...the weapon selection was thin, as was the vehical selection. And I think the master chief had just a little to much ability to resist enemy fire. I was hoping for more of a battle filled game with more veriaty of weapons and power ups. but I did like the grenades. In other FPS's you have to hav ethe grenade as a weapon. in halo you can shoot then throw a grenade when needed. This game also only has four main enemies with one other type. the flood. but each type of allian race has about two or three different levels of it.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, WAIT FOR THE SECOND ONE!!!"
4,hotter than Bond,"Amazing- truly amazing. This is the best xbox game released thus far. halo is n64's goldeneye. You will not be dissapointed with Halo's interesting storyline, awesome graphics, and awesome weapons."
3,"Excellent Graphics, but Perfect Dark is better","Bought X Box with the primary reason to get Halo. Played for 3 weeks and have completed the mission. It is much too short and too easy. Plus the say 20 missions (I forget the actual number) you only go through 10 different levels, as the second half is merely going back through the ones you went through in the first half!...Hopefully Halo2 has a much improved multiplayer.Halo is great visually, and the rumble controller firing the weapons is cool,..."
4,BEST Game Ever well except maybe Halo 2!!!,"This Game is Awesome And the people who say it sucks NO!!! It doesn't! This is an awesome game with good graphics and weapons. I can't wait till Halo 2 comes out!!! Buy Buy Buy This Game Even if you don't have an Xbox buy it on Pc or If you have an Xbox Buy it for that. I love This Game!!! It has 10 levels and four difficultys to choose from. Also BUY the Soundtrack the music is cool!!! My favorite veichle is the banshee, the scorpion,and the warthog. My favorite weapons are Assault Rifle, Plamsa Grenade,Shotgun,and theRocket Launcher well, acutualy all of them expect Plasma Pistol it sucks kind of."
4,review,"this game is really good, but it kinda gets old....for inctance, all of the levels are very different and unique, but they take too long and so the uniqueness is lost because you end up spending an hour on the same levelgraphics: 20/20really great grahics - mostly any picture is screen shot worthyreplayability: 10/20gets old as i saidplayability: 17/20great controls, gets boring thoughrestraints: 15/20great how you can go all over the planet, but the levels make it less open ended, but this is a hard categorystory: 15/20pretty basic aliens vs. humans but they beef it up with robots and suchSUBTOAL77/100BONUS+5 multiplayer+4 setable difficultyTOTAL86/100"
3,2 overrated!,"good not GREAT. Its WAY overrated. All my friends told me,&quot; Oh man you gotta get it!&quot; so i did. It was good until i got to a part i couldnt pass. So i sat there trying to get passed it. And i couldnt. So... What do u want me to say? Good game and all. But nothing to get excited over. I gave it a 3 outta 5 because when i play the 2 player mode with sum friends, its really fun. 2 player is the only time i play it. Otherwise, its just sitting with all of my other xbox games. Later."
5,THE BEST GAME PERIOD IS HALO:COMBAT ENVOLVED,"One word HALO. This game has everything a real gamer would desire,advanced AI,breathtaking graphics,great story,awesome 1st person and 3rd person views,and really too much to name. BOTTOM LINE GET THIS GAME NOW IF YOU DON'T ALREADY OWN IT(...)"
3,Over Rated!!!!,I wish I could understand the fascination with this game. The graphics are solid and the control is excellent but the levels have way too much repetition. The industructible vehicles are a joke and how many times do we have to kill zombies. I thought Resident Evil and House of the Dead covered that angle along time ago. I found Catwoman cracking her whip way more entertaining than that stupid Library level.
5,Great Game,"I spent the most time with my friends playing video games, playing on Halo. I, personally, think it is better (gameplay wise) than Halo 2. The graphics may not be as great, but the game is still really fun to play. My favourite map definately has to be Sidewinder, its huge and the best looking. If you have a Xbox this is a must own."
5,"HALO IS A MUST BUY FOR EVERYONE, EVEN IF YOU HATE XBOX","Halo is the ultimate XBOX game. Besides the fact that it is the best action game of the year says IGN. Electronic gaming monthly gave Halo a perfect 10. Gamepro gave it a 5.0, 5.0, 4.5, and 5.0 fun factor out of 5. This is one of those few games that even though you have beat the game, there are still hings to do with the game{besides trade it in}. The game has excellent graphics thanx to XBOX 125 million polygons per second {raw}. NO im NOT a XBOX FREAK WHO HATES ALL OTHER SYSTEMS. Simply, if you have an XBOX you owe it to yourself, to share the true meaning of gaming technology and go buy this game. Fast."
5,This game is so fricken awesome 100 stars,This game is the best game ever. The graphics are amazing.The gameplay s awazing. Everything is.Everyone that says Halo sucks or Xbox sucks. it's really them.
3,FPS without PC keyboard doesn't work,"If you like console-based FPS games, you're in heaven. Get it, get the X-Box because of it.Otherwise...It's a beautiful game, but there is only so much you can do with a hand-held controller...the finger-yoga required to jump, shoot and run at the same time while looking what is going on behind you is too much. It's not intuitive.Hopefully they'll port it to the PC."
5,HALO IS BY FAR THE GREATEST GAME EVER MADE!,"I got Project Gotham Racing, NFL Fever 2002, and Halo for Christmas. And by a close race my favorite game is Halo. I like it because you get to drive a truck and plenty of alien ships. Also the game has a great lasting appeal. There are four levels of difficulty and I am having some trouble getting through the normal mode. The graphics in this game are exceptional. It feels like you are controling somebody in movie. My friends and I played the multiplayer and it was the most fun I have ever had playing a video game. I smell another Goldeneye even better."
2,Overrated bigtime,"I cant see why people call halo the greatest fps of all time. i played the game at a friends house and i was expecting more from the game. the single player was simply pointless. there was no point to it. the 2 stars are for the multiplayer, which is fun for the first 15 minutes and then gets repetitive and boring. the graphics are ok but the controls are truly horrible. the whole x-box controller design is horrible for that matter. Max Payne, especially on PC, is a much more interesting and enjoyable game than halo. a disappointment."
4,MOST OVERATED GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,halo game of the year??? [no way] the multiplayer definatly is the spotlight of this game you can use all weapons any vehicles different environments and you can customize everything/ the gameplay is a little different the realism of the enemy is not very pleasing to fans of realistic combat sims if they would have made the enemy a little more people like this game would rule the world my advice to you if you want a multiplayer dream get halo the gameplay isnt all the bad: its just OVERATED
4,H to the ALO,"HOlla at you boys.This is the best game ever. Period. The single player action alone is enough to buy the game but what sets HALO apart from all other games is its unreal multiplayer. The ability to link up to four x boxs and achieve 16 player action is great. The shooting, graphics and gameplay are unparalleled.""MUST NOT LET THEM GET THE ROCKET LAUNCHER!!!!!"""
5,GRATEST FPS EVER,"I love Halo, Halo is Great form the indepth story line to the amazing weponry it is great in every way shap and form"
5,Halo,I was only about nine when i first started playing Halo and I'm only 12 now but this has to be the best game released. It's a classic game of first hand shooting with flawless graphics (for when it came out anyway) and it's four difficulty settings will leave you trying to beat the game on all four difficulties. I must suck at this game because i can't even beat this on heroic. It's well worth the price and i'd reccomend it to all fans of first hand shooters.
4,Halo,"Good game that could have been better... There are some spectacular boards and then there are levels that look the same for what seems like forever, as if the designers got lazy and decided to use the same scene over, and over...and what's with only being able to carry 2 guns..."
2,not very good,"it was a cute game, but i quickly lost interest in jumping through all the obvious hoops setup by the programmer. this is a probably will never play again and should not have bought even though it was twenty bucks deal."
5,Why change the platform,The platform has been changed to fit the Xbox only. The start of this series was also designed to be played on a PC. Why must we give up the fun of playing because we can't afford an Xbox in this time of change?
4,BEST GRAPHICS EVER,This game is funny all the way through and the graphics [are great].Its fun for the whole family to whatch as one of you plays the game.Buy it wright know or your missing out.
4,Awesome,This was one of xbox's first games and I think it has some of the best graphics of all of em. It has a great campaign and the only thing that could be better would be if it was a 2-player and worked on x-box live.
2,Weirdist Game ever its okay,"Weird,barly cool and its got good graphics?????????? MAN ALL X-BOX AND GAMECUBE GAMES HAVE GOOD GRAPHICS MAN WHY IS EVERY ONE SO HYPED UP FOR GOOD GRAPHICS.(Nintendo's Better than X-Box...;)"
2,Better to rent,"Nice graphics, a few exciting moments, and kinda cute. But the gameplay is bland and and doesn't do a good job of captivating the player."
4,Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee,"You can buy this for pc also, simply awesome graphics, very realistic, but corny at the same time. Depends on where your humor level is...and if the great graphics are enough for you. Gameplay, good for kids...not so much for adults."
5,A Magical Book!,"This book is great for any child! It has a great theme for anyone who loves fairies! The book brings you along as if you were in the story meeting the fairies yourself. This book is a great entertainment for any child who loves magic! They will have fun reading this enjoyable book.Cynthia Marie Rizzo author of ""Julie and the Unicorn"" and ""Angela and the Princess"""
1,Fairy book,"This was such a disappointing book! The description and picture selection is so misleading. It was difficult for me, a mature person to read it-I bought it for my 7 year old grandaughter-but after looking it over, I returned it. This book needs re-doing. I would not reccomend it for any age! Lynn"
1,A Rip-off,"I'm not sure why people keep buying this book or giving it good reviews. It's an obvious rip-off of much better books--the ology series by Candlewick. Plus, this book is very hard to read, especially for children, uses some one else's innovations, and is poorly and luridly designed. Although the art inside uses some of Cicely Mary Barker's originals, the rest is very amateurishly done photoshop work. I feel bad for Ms. Barker that her delightful art is given a forum that is in very bad taste. It's a shame that the publisher couldn't come up with their own idea on how to showcase her work, but had to rip off some one else. <sigh>"
3,"400 tablets, 6 times a day?","I'm not really a superstitious guy but there are certain numbers you are put off by. I looked at the serving instructions and, what do I see? 400 tablets taken 6 times daily. The serving size per container just happened to be 66.6666666666... infinitum. What's the deal? Someone playing practical jokes here?"
3,Too much!,"I made the mistake of buying this 5-pound bag of powdered Spirulina before trying out a smaller-sized jar. Now I'm stuck with all this glop which doesn't mix and has the consistency of crude-oil.This stuff just doesn't blend! I started with a spoon and a glass but that wasn't working because the spirulina stuck to the mixing spoon and to the sides and bottom of the glass. I then purchased a juicer-blender and ran into the same problem. I even tried coating the glass with flax-seed oil, but no success.To think of all the money spent makes me feel like a fool. Can anyone tell me what I can do with the remaining 4 1/2 pounds of product??It's not the manufacturer's fault but I feel any NEW users of spirilina need to know that they will have a problem with this powder.:-("
3,Spirulina Pacifica Powder,My wife and I have used this product for a few weeks now and haven't noticed any changes. We bought this product based on a recommendation and testimonies. Maybe we should or have to wait a few more weeks to notice any changes.
2,No Good - Taste bad and sticks to shaker or anything you try to blend this with,"This product is no good. Just juice, its better than going with this. The one at wholefoods showed show much more nutrients. This one had no protein and i didnt like it."
4,StarTech.com 2 Port PCI IDE Controller Adapter Card PCIIDE2,"The product worked fine but when installing it the first time it did not fit right. The card clamp was mounted on the wrong side of the card, simple fix remove two screws place the card clamp on the other side of the card reinstall the screws. It then slid right into my PC's PCI slot and has worked fine since."
3,"Easy as 1,2,3...4","Did everything StarTech said it would. Thank you for that! Controller came out of the box with ease and plugged into the PCI slot effortlessly. Rebooted the computer and Win XP recognized the card without a hitch. The 80 conductor cable was easy to hook up but the length could have been 2"" longer. My machine has it's card slot way at the bottom of the cage and my optic drives are at the top front of the case. Once connected with an alternate longer cable it worked fine.I had an issue with my registry not showing or being able to access my optic drives, so once that was corrected my original IDE channel 2 worked properly and I didn't need the board after all."
4,Another Great Game by EA Sports,"I'm not a NASCAR fan, but I love this game. It is very fun to play. I'm hoping to get a steering wheel to control the car better. It's kidda hard to keep your car steady in the turns with the regular controller. I wish the engines were louder, but that's an easy fix. Hook your stereo up to your TV, if you can, and blast ""Sweet Home Alabama"" over and over again. My wife hates it when I do that, but what's NASCAR without the sound? All this coming from a BLACK man. Who says we can't race stock cars?"
4,Worked well with a little trial and error,"I used the diffuser right out of the box during a recent photo shoot. The setting was a banquet hall with about a 15' ceiling. Not having a chance to test different angles prior to the job, I shot some small groups of people from various distances before the event got underway. It took just a few shots to determine the best angles to use from various distances. The results were very good, and I only had to reshoot a couple of times to get a better lighting effect. Fit on my Olympus FL-36 flash was ok - not the tightest, but snug enough.Overall performance was good, and I'll use it from now on when shooting parties and events."
1,Absolute Poorest,"This 700 plus pages book is without a doubt the least helpful of any tutorial book I have ever read. It is money wasted. Vague, rambling, poorly organized and the paper used is suitable only for recycling. There are far better books on PSE3. Don't buy it! G. W. House"
4,solid performance and well recorded,"The players are all excellent and their interpretations are nearly perfect. The Crespo is an interesting composition, if a bit (1941) ""old fashioned."" The Arnold is performed with razor sharp precision...especially the trombone ""recitative"" in the second movement and the two-trumpet sextuplets offset by one half beat at the end of the third movement. The Ewald is done pretty much like all other recordings since it is a Brass Quintet staple. The Horowitz Music Hall Suite seems a bit too quick in places and almost seems as if the group was unwilling to grasp the composer's intent; I much prefer the recording of Philip Jones Brass Ensemble for their humor and delicacy of the interpretation.But if you are looking for a solid, well recorded, good jumping off place to delve into Brass Quintet music...then this is a great recording to sample the waters."
2,Stopped working,"I bought this charger because of the retractable cord and I thought it would be less bulky in my car. I used it periodically, maybe once or twice a week during my commute, and after 6 months, the device stopped charging. I thought it was my port but it was the charger as I bought a second charger from a local electronic store that worked but when I switched out chargers to this one, the phone would not charge. I have an iPhone now but this product cannot be recommended."
3,Doesn't fit the nokia n95-3,"Looks like it would work great. It's small and the retractable cord is a plus, but it doesn't fit the nokia n95, the NAM edition anyway."
5,Love the old music!,These songs sure do bring back great memories! Takes me back to the 50's and 60's. Always loved the Duprees
2,Worst Game on the system,The controls are extremly hard to use and the game is extreamly hard I didn't like the game at all.
3,Dont Believe all the Hype....,"this is a good game over all, except it is near impossible to control the cars. Everyone said this is the best racing game, but I tend to disagree. The whole point is a Kudos system. To receive maximum kudos, one must slide around corners without crashing *is this even possible* The graphics are awsome, and there are some great cars, but the overall game play sucks, because you can't race, only skid around corners. And the games where you must race through cones is almost impossible. I'd like to see you skid through corners with little control going 100+ and not hit cones bearly far apart to walk through. I suppose it would be worth it to buy because it is so cheap, and can usually be picked up for around $15-$20. The challenge alone of not hitting corners is worth it, and it will keep you entertained for hours, but i wouldnt recommend buying any future Project Gotham games untill they drop to near free"
5,I AM OBSESSED,All i can say is wow ive never played GT3(which is prolly better with all the cars and such) but this game is just amazin after the first 10 mins i didnt like it now i love it
3,A SOMETIME ADVENTURE!,"A player can easily get wrapped up in this game. It can be fun for all ages, however, after a while it becomes a little redundant. As far as racing games, I do feel as if this is truly one of the best that I have played...if that is what YOU are into. The grapics and sound are both awesome...and I would recommend this game to all race car lovers and children everywhere!!!"
5,"Terrific fun, but limited shelf life","Racing games never appealed to me, until PGR came along. The kudos system looks weird at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's just pure fun. It beats just running around in laps competing on time alone. I just wish there were more courses/cities to race on."
5,Awesome,I liked the game becuase the cars have real damages when u race. Well worth the money I would recommend to anyone.
1,Toyota Fun,"Cruising around in a Toyota at 60mph while almost stopping to make turns, does not a fun game make. Graphics in the opening sequence are cool, but..., then you actually have to play the game. Poor you."
4,Fun racing game,"This is a very fun racing game...once you get used to the gameplay. This game isn't for the ""All Accelerator..No Brake"" race fan..you really have to learn how to drive the car. I would say the initial learning curve is about 2 hours. But after that, the Kudos point system makes this game a blast!"
2,"Graphically good, game play okay","The graphics in this game are really nice, but the game play got old and frustrating very quickly. I have heard this game being compared to GT3 by the MicroSoft lacky's but I can tell you it is no where near the quality, depth and game play of GT. The car models are well done, but the AI and difficulty curve and controls were a bit half baked. I have not tried it with the wheel which I understand is a much better experience, but who wants to spend that much money on one game."
1,think twice,"this game has no point, grahics are good, detail good, but the game is so poitnless, it works on a kudos system from that dreamcast game which flopped, dont buy it"
2,Please..nice try but what a scam,"This game looked to be good for all the hype but when i played the game it reminded me of a dreamcast game i once played. i could'nt remember which one it was util i read though these reviews. good memory johnn225, dang. i took that game back to the store after having it for a couple of days. this game is just the same just with a little more tweaks put into it. i can't believe some of the reviews that some of the web sites are giving this game. i mean these people review games for a living and they some how forgot that this game is just a remake from a few years ago. Shame on Microsoft for trying to pass this off as a new game and at launch time..."
4,"Good game, nice graphics but...","But I really prefer Rally racing...If you like racing around real cities, and lots of them, in real cars then this game is fun, but you can't upgrade cars.You can race a mini cooper though, which is awesome!"
5,World's most widely heard horn player.,"James Thatcher has been heard by more people than any other horn player, as he is soloist on hundreds of movie sound tracks- Titanic, Field of Dreams etc.Here he shows his amazing chops in some horn arrangements of Bach cello suites and more. Great technique and musicianship. Five star disc!!!!"
4,very good Playing,"3 of some of the finest breed of trumpet players alive today. Vizzuti, DiMartino, and the great Bobby Shew! There arent too many other recordings out there with as much talent in one group. It very interesting to go back and liesten to some of these guys on their solo albums after listening to them together. Especially Bobby shew, This guy can play! The reason i give it a 4 is because there are points where they are trying too hard to outdo eachother by craming notes, particularly from Vizzuti but it is still well worth your $$$"
3,There's better...,"I'm an immigration lawyer who has a lot of the ""laymen"" books on the shelves. The nutshell is not bad, but it's more for cramming in law school or if you want an overview with a bit more ""legal stuff."" However... the NOLO books are better. I have them, I use them, I like them better. FYI- the most lawyer type book on immigration law for those who want some real detail along with case law... look up Ira Kurzban's book. Cost $300."
5,Outstanding wind writing,"This is an outstanding CD that shows terrific writing for wind instruments. Writing for wind ensemble does not have to be musically inferior, as these composers show.Of particular note are the pieces by Maslanka and Rodrigo. Who knew Rodrigo wrote music for wind ensemble? It is both a delicate yet exciting work that shows the various instruments off to best advantage (without any unnecessary doublings that mar so many wind band pieces). It's a shame this piece isn't performed more often.The Maslanka is a heartfelt memorial tribute that exploits all of the modern textures of the wind band, including organ! Yet, the sonorities are never used to excess--each texture seems perfectly suited to the mood and the overall arc of the piece, which ends on a sad note, as if converying the sadness of a life unfinished.The Husa is also terrific, and competes well with many other recordings of these works.Highly recommended."
2,darkness rules,These films are too dark and much of the action cannot be followed. Nothing is worse that a sword fight where the action can't be seen. It's strange that Criterion should release these wonderful films in this way as they usually use great prints. Quite disappointing!
3,Second Rate Soap...but good cinematography,"Some movies stand the test of time. Not this one...Samurai Trilogy. The movie may very well be a big deal 40 years ago. Not now.Moreover, the movie changed the life story of Miyamoto Musashi. For those who are interested, read his book, ""A Book of Five Ring."" Want to see a true samurai movie? Get ""Samurai Rebellion."""
4,samurai trilogy,"I was very pleased with this collection because I was unable to find the complete 3movie set at the video store where I rent. I received the package very quickly, and the set was in perfect condition."
5,True Testimonial,"Unlike most of the reviewers here, I've played this fantastic game at XBox Unleashed in LA. This game is beautiful with smooth animation and fantastic sets. Far better than Mario Party the minigames here shine, the games are all intuitive for the most part, and after a few rounds, competition is fierce for all games.You do everything from variations of Tron, to old fashioned shooting galleries, to Toobin style races, Tank battles, Parappa style competitions, to vicious versions of Tag, protecting burgers from bugs, SUMO, and classic games seen on the old American Gladiators. That's only a small sample. This game is a blast."
3,Fun for a while,"This is microsoft's first (and only?) party-game. Through the round you play minigames for orbs. At the end of the round is a fusion frenzy, where you bet or bank your orbs. You then try to get as many orbs into a scoring zone as you can to get points. Whoever has the most points at the end of the rounds (2, 4, or 6), wins the game.Each level has its unique minigames. At the military base you drive tanks, the waterfront level has bumper boats. But many of the minigames are very similar.The graphics are OK, although the camera angle zooms out so far it's often hard to make out what's going on. The sound is OK as well, but you can play with music you've saved on your x-box, which is nice.Nintendo started the party-game genre with Mario Party, and Fusion Frenzy is a far cry from being nearly as fun. This definately is not a game to play by yourself, so don't bother unless you have a roommate/spouse/sibling that you know will play this with you."
4,best multiplayer game for non-gamers,"If you have a lot of friends who don't like video games... let them play this a few times, and they are hooked. It is extremely easy to catch on b/c the controls are simple as can get, and there are 45 games within this this disc."
1,this is the Worst game in creation,"this game is so bad that i traded it for some demo disks!!the mini-games are the worst thing to put on your Xbox anytimeSample mini-game: ""collect as many rockets as you can and the runover to the lanuching pad to launch the rockets"" Vary boring.Another mini-game: ""whack bugs with your big hammer to keep themfrom eating your cheeseburger"" Vary stupidI am writing this review as a courtesy. save your money."
1,FRUSTRATING,This clock drives us crazy- when you try to shut off the alarm- the clock slides all over- (shut-off is on the side)- it should have been on the top!Poor design.
2,Nice.... just nice.,"He's competent in the verdi, and nearly competent in the puccini...... but the hype? all these review excerpts on the cover? are we really that desperate? do we need all those unnecessary ""breaking headlines"" trying to be cool and trendy slogan/reviews trying to suggest to us that something is world class when there are better tenors singing in provincial italian theatres? Dont get me wrong, Licitra is not bad at all, but I'm sick and tired of hyped up singers like him getting all the juicy bits when true new greats like Alagna are rubbished. I agree with the guy that wrote in his review that Bjorling is better, not just because he is, but because i reccomend anyone who likes this CD to listen to anything bjorling recorded..... just to hear how it should be done. Minus the hype."
2,The Disappointment,"Like so many others I was drawn to listen to this CD after reading about the ""Pavarotti debacle"" at the Met. After hearing this ""Debut"" I can only express my deepest ""Disappointment."" True, Licitra has a basically dark, not unattractive tone and a sense of authentic Italian ""slancio."" What he lacks is a proper sense of line, comfortable control of dynamics, and - above all! - elegance. It is all too tight, coarse, and crude. Compare Licitra's ""La parterna mano"" to Bergonzi's and note the latter's superior line. Björling's ""Donna non vidi mai"" displays the elegance Lictra lacks. Even the uneven and wayward Di Stefano has more bounce and joy than Lictra does in ""Di tu se fidele"" not to mention real heart-felt pianissimi in ""E lucevan le stelle."" By the time I came to Lictra's ham-fisted approach to ""Celeste Ada"" I was ready to stop this disc and reach for the Björling recital on Naxos where half the price delivers twice the voice and three times the musicianship."
2,Try before you buy,"I got this at TJ Maxx for 15$ and it wasn't really worth it. Although it will straighten your hair, it's not the nice, silky straight I was looking for, and it works best on the higher settings which fry your hair. I have fairly straight hair to begin with, so I was disappointed by this product."
5,electrical estimation made easy,this book makes electrical estimation easy and fast. it has added benifits of a cd and internet access. it has made my estimations faster and is accurate.
1,Duhhhh!,"Maybe someone should write 1 player, 2players, 3players yadda yadda instead of frickin leaving everyone guessing."
3,"maybe good, cannot adjust temperature range","Looks good, everything connected easy. However wish the fan speeds were adjustable. It sets my fans at high setting at just 32C (90F) in the case, which makes my fans sound like they are going to blast off when i am just idling. This cannot be changed. Alarm clock didnt work, but didnt really care about that in the first place. Going to return and just get one with adjustable nobs."
2,Good book but pretty obvious/basic,"Great for high level basics... for some it would certainly be obvious and not well worth the time, but for others it could provide a nice, base foundation for decision making. I certainly can't say I disagree with much in the book."
5,The Car Seat Saved My Son's Life,"I never imagined my 2 year old son would need his car seat for the intended purpose. Last week my husband and son were driving together when someone crashed into them head-on going 55 miles an hour. My son wasn't hurt at all!! He only had 2 little marks on his neck from the straps on the car seat. My husband ended up breaking his hand. They say after a child safety seat is involved in an accident you should throw it away and buy another one. I am buying the exact one. Needless to say, I am very satisfied with this seat and I give it 5 out of 5 stars!!!!"
3,Not great for tall kids,We bought this seat in hopes that my son would be able to use it for a long time. It was great while it lasted but he is now two and a half and has out grown it. He is 39 inches and 38 pounds and his legs dangle uncomfortably over the end and his shoulders are too broad for the seat so he has to sit at an angle. It's very disappointing for a car seat that's supposed to hold bigger kids.
5,Happy car rider,Absolutely love this carseat!!! Baby loves that it is soft and cushy. The bottom buckle is a little hard to get undone but usually its because baby is squirming to get out!
1,"Awkward harness, buckle and adjustment","After reading all the rave reviews, I was so thrilled to finally be able to install this once my son outgrew his Graco Snugride. I HATE it. I just can't seem to be able to get the straps adjusted correctly and the one strap is twisted after like 3 uses! And I can't seem to untwist it... it somehow got twisted behind the seat. Also, it won't adjust properly and I can't tighten the straps like I want. Now I have to take this stupid behemoth of a car seat out of my car and bring it in the house and turn it upside down and fix the flippin strap and see what is going on with the adjusting strap. Even when it was working, it seemed like the fit wasn't right for my 9mo old 21lb son. I just don't feel he is safe in the seat. Not what I want out of an almost $300 car seat.I am NOT happy. This seat sucks."
4,Who Knew Consignment Shops were so fascinating?,"The Picker Who Perished is not only a great read -- fast paced, funny, with intriguing characters -- but gives a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the consignment shop business. Holmes has a winner in Wendy Sam. I look forward to her next mystery."
4,Good and Bad,Some of the chapters are very interesting to read and than there are some other chapters that were very hard to read.
4,"Helpful, but brief","Inside the Music is an eminently readable book, but I can't help but feel a little let down by its brevity and lack of in-depth exploration of some of the concepts put forth. For example: too often, when going through different chord voicings, the author's contribution was little more than what the reader could have figured out on their own just by adding notes together themselves.Still, I'm sure I'll refer to this book often and I'm generally happy with the purchase."
4,Fun,Easy movie....fun....liked it...Didn't know what to expected but was just a fune movie....another plane ride movie....worked great! Would recommend it..
1,Terrible!!,"I hated what I did see. Full of offensive cursing and crude talk/sex scenes. The acting was awful, the script was awful, I turned it off within 20 minutes. YUK. YUK. YUK."
3,Standard BluRay upgrade,Standard BluRay upgrade but a little disappointed that no digital copy version released...I originally purchased the Collectors Edition only to find out the Original Tron included was only the bluray disc and no regular DVD nor any Digital copy....it was cheaper to just by the Legacy 4 disc set and the separate Original Tron (which though it didnt come with a digital copy it did come with a DVD disc also)
4,"Was quick, fast, and easy!",Everything was quick and easy. The product was exactly as you described it. No problems!! I will definitely do business with you again.
4,The Classic,I must say im impressed for over 25 years!!!! Clean transfer and the colors are rich and the picture is pretty clean overall. Good buy for the quality and classic. Good for fans of HD
4,Allegories and perspectives,"While many people may view the plot of Tron as lackluster, I feel that Tron does have a type of analogy that is extremeley relevant today: the concept of a monopolistic software company taking over programs produced by other companies and using all sorts of techniques to force the user to communicate only with programs created by the monopolistic software company. In short, Microsoft would be an equivalent of the Master Control Program.The only downside to the movie is the character development. I would have liked the character Flynn to show more shock at his own creations and how his own creations have been used against him. He did show shock when he passed by the enemy tanks while fleeing on a lightcycle, but that wasn't enough."
5,What a great movie!!,"I am pre-ordering TODAY!! I remember watching TRON when I was little (about 8 if I remember). And watched it almost every year after that. I must have rented the same tape quite a few times!! What a joy to find out it is going to be released in a DVD anniversary edition!!The special effects were marvelous for the time! The neo-fantastic colors and graphics were well made for a movie before its time! It was so weird (and now that I look back, philosophical) to have each ""program"" given a human body. Makes you think what AI will ""really"" think about us when/if we ever perfect it. And, more importantly the story line. When it all comes down to it, the basic's of the movie is man against machine (and we all know who wins that battle). The music is the icing on the cake. The synthesizer back-tech sounds will amaze you. (for the time of the movie)Popcorn and soda in front of the TV (with your kids if you have any), and see the movie that you will not forget."
4,Special Edition extras revealed,"For the record, ...this 20th Anniversary Tron 2-disc set DOES have plenty of extras, in fact, it sounds like a port of the Masterpiece Edition laser disc set with even more goodies. Here is what is known as of Oct 1, 2001:* A new 75-minute documentary called, ""The Making of Tron""* Deleted scenes with all- new introductions by writer / director Steven Lisberger and visual effects supervisor Harrison Ellenshaw* Production photo gallery with new photos from the Disney photo archives* Audio commentary by director Steven Lisberger, producer Donald Kushner and visual effects supervisors Harrison Ellenshaw and Richard Taylor* Storyboard to film comparisons* Extensive still frame galleries* Pre- production animation tests* Original Wendy Carlos soundtrack music deleted from the film* Inspirational designs by design artists Syd Mead, Peter Lloyd and Jean ""Moebius"" Giraud* Computer animation design and demo reels* Original publicity materials* Original theatrical trailer"
5,Groundbreaking and great value!,"Come on, it's Tron. In high definition! Of course it's great! I bought this version because it was cheaper to get this and the sequel separately than it was to get them packaged together.And it comes with a DVD copy too (also very good quality video and sound), so I am not restricted to watching the film in one room (can't expect many people to have more than one blu ray player except hardcore film buffs). Great value, five stars!"
4,Glad I got it when I did.,I had Tron on VHS since it first came out. Just about 6 months ago I bought the 20TH Anniversary Edition at a garage sale for $3.00. I am sure glad I did not pass it by and leave without it.I've been told by a guy I work with and let barrow it that his friends are envious. For those complaining about the price it's to be expected. Disney likes to release things and then take them away. Since it's not available from Disney people are selling the movie for a high price. Some people are crazy enough to pay the $200 price. As for myself no. It is a great movie for when it first came out and now it is a classic. So until Disney re-releases out on dvd again do not expect the price to go lower.
4,"Great, innovative visually awesome movie","The plot is a little sketchy and the acting can be hokey at times, but there never has been nor will there ever be another movie that looks like Tron. It is simply awesome. The extras on this disc are also very well done. THere's a long interesting documentary and a bunch of other stuff that really make this disc well worth the price."
4,This version upconverts to HD very well.,"TRON is one of my all time favorite films. This 20th Aniviversary Edition is awesome. It is packed with extras for you folks who, like myself, are into the conceptual/behind the camera element of film making. The image quality is very good, no complaint really. Some film grain is visible but nothing distracting.The trailer for the upcoming sequel, TRON: Legacy([...]) made me bust out my copy of this 20th aniversary Edition to watch the original again. Popped it into my PS3 and it is upconverting to 1080p beautifully. Since there isn't an HD quality version available *yet* I figured this info might be useful to someone who wanted to pick it up but was waiting for Blu Ray version. Unless they spend lots of time remastering it for HD, I don't think it will get much better. Most of the older films I have picked up on Blu Ray haven't been that much better than an upconverted version of the DVD, only exception I can make is Close Encounters, it looks fantastic."
5,"Great product, tip top condition despite being used","Everytime I buy a used DVD or CD, it usually has scratches on it, even if they're just minimal. This double DVD had zero scratches and kept in AWESOME condition. I just want to point that out because this person could have charged more money for this movie but chose not to up the cost. I was able to watch this movie with my 8 year old son on Christmas night (the same night he got it). We had a blast watching Jeff Bridges in the original version and seeing all the light cycles and light suits in comparison with the new movie, Tron Legacy. Definintely different and always fun to see how they did special effects in the 80's compared to today!"
4,Stunning!,"Considering that this film was made in the early 80's, it is a work of art. Even now, it runs circles around The Matrix and that film was made more than 15 years later!"
2,Great sfx...not so great a story,"Jeff Bridges is Kevin Flynn...a computer genius who had his computer game ideas ripped off by a man called ""Dillinger"" (David Warner) Now Flynn wants to prove the theft...so when he hacks into the computer and get gets zapped into the computer world by the MCP (Master Control Program) to play computer games. He meets TRON who helps him destroy the MCP & release the truth about the theft. Great SFX in the computer world, but a VERY SLOW & stilted script. There should have been more computer game sequences & other heart-stopping action to make it more exciting. But it's a real let down."
3,Fabulous until the end,"This was a fun military sci-fi romp, until part three was tacked on to the end. If it had to end the way it did, then the series should have started with the second book.That said, the characters were multifaceted and fun. Killing bug-creatures with swords was wonderful and campy.Not a bad read."
1,A huge disappointment,"Having read and enjoyed all of Ms Meluch's previous books, I was very happy to learn that she had written a new one. Unfortunately, the long hiatus since her last book appears to have had a terrible effect upon her as an author. This book was an enormous disappointment; a meretricious farrago with characterisation that makes the average film of algae look substantial, lazy plotting and lazier world-building, amounting to a caricature of the stalest tropes of the military space opera genre.I might have accepted this in a satire, but unfortunately it wasn't funny either. To readers who want action, originality, humour, logical extrapolation of world from artifact and plot from character, and characters that are people rather than sock-puppets, I recommend Lois McMaster Bujold."
4,Schutzhund: Theory and Training Methods,"Whether novice or experienced trainer, anyone who desires to learn what Schutzhund is about - get this book! It identifies the short comings of the old school methods of training with objective, rational and real world proof - and this book opened my eyes. It is a pleasure to read and includes several photographs that pictorially represent what the author is discussing. It demonstrates the theory behind the methods of training as well as establishing objectives in training to accomplish the goals desired in formats that work."
4,"Excellent introduction to dog training, not just schutzhund.","One of the better dog training books in that addresses the handler's responsibilities to ""read"" the dog and to distinguish between the dog and the handler's ego. This book also has a nice section on puppy selection. Overall, well written, thoughtful, and sensible."
3,It's an EP for god's sake!,"Duh!Most EPs are 5-8 tracks long, so I don't understand why people are saying this CD is too short. The remixes on here are pretty decent, they're much better than the crap remixes on the Illmatic 10th Anniversary album. The ""Life's a B****"" arsenal remix is on-point and the ""Affirmative Action"" remix is nicely done as well. Hardcore Nas fans won't be dissappointed, and should be willing to dish out 9 bucks for these decent remixes of classic Nas joints."
3,STREET DREAMER,"1.""LIFE'S A B#TCH""- THIS MIX FEATURES AZ, I DON'T REALLY LIKE THIS JOINT, BUT I LIKE BOTH OF THEM2.""ONE LOVE""-I ALSO DIDN'T LIKE THIS ONE3.""IT AIN'T HARD TO TELL""-I KINDA LIKE LIKE THIS ONE, IT'S OK4.""STREET DREAMS""-THE BEST SONG ON HERE, FEATURES CHILD BOY HIMSELF R KELLY5.""AFFIMATIVE ACTION""-THIS IS A HOT REMIX FROM THE FIRM6.""ONE MIC""-I'AM SORRY IT SOUNDS THE SAME TO ME AS THE ORIGANALTHIS CD SHOULD HAVE BEEN LONGER, 1"
3,Good Basic Display,"I have owned this display for 4 months now and I am happy with it's performance. This is a display that is suitable for basic office type work, I would not suggest this unit for graphics work."
3,Samsug Monitor,The monitor does what it is suppose to doBut I have a hard time seeing print but that may be just me
4,Great product,"Great product! Took me a little bit of ""tweaking"" to get the desired settings and resolution (I do not have the digital video input, so had to settle for analog). However, there is a very noticeable difference in output quality from the clunky 17 inch dinosaur I upgraded from. Arrived promptly and well packaged, and was the best and most cost-effective product of its type on the market. Samsung has a great reputation for flatscreen monitors, and I am very impressed with what this monitor brings to my computing experience. Highly recommended!"
5,the most comprehensive book on transients,this is the best book ever written on fluid transients and all the other authors copy fomr this book so go ahead and buy one
3,Decent,Arrived promptly and on time. The only complaint I have is that the quick access flap which is made of rubber quickly tore off! This is my second Jeff Gordon Thermos cooler by the way and I don't recall if the first one broke off or not. Anyhow I'm glad I found it once again. I bought my original cooler at Walmart many eons ago and never could find another until recently. Thank You!
2,A dry read,"I was expecting more information on the structure of foam and/or soap bubbles. Rather you have a wide ranging, scientific, and dry book about various manifestations of foam. It reads like one long magazine article and the writing style does not really capture the readers attention. At the end of the book you will not be able to say what, if anything, you got from the material. Instead you might get better information fromSoap Bubbles: Their Colors and Forces Which Mold ThemorThe Science of Soap Films and Soap Bubbles."
3,Not Quite Ready for Prime Time,"I am an early adapter of gadgets, having bought a Pilot 1000, then a Palm VII, and Visor Deluxe. My friends raved about Blackberry's ease of use for email and how much it helped them to stay in touch with clients so I bought one. Unfortunately, we use Lotus Notes at work and although we have a Domino server set up, the software seems to have a few glitches synching with Notes' calendar, to do, and memo features. Email works pretty well. I subtract one star because the synching of emails into folders is not perfect, causing me to have to save email into folders first on the blackberry and then on my PC. I am told that this is due to Notes and that if I used Outlook things would work better. Still, at this point in the technology curve I would expect RIM to have worked out the glitches for all sorts of email and PIM programs. So I'm thinking of going back to my Visor and installing a wireless modem for it (which I understand works perfectly)."
3,Still waiting for a good book on Wong,"The problem for me with Teo's references to telos or Julia Kristeva, to follow-up on the comments of a previous reviewer, is that they seem symptomatic of the author's inability to truly get a handle on Wong's films. Teo applies ideas/theories to Wong's works like a graduate student dutifully displaying his wares. His work seems generally intelligent (as a student he'd get an A- for the assignment), but he provides very little insight into Wong's aesthetic. It came as little surprise, toward the end of the book, when the author admitted his indifference to In the Mood for Love. One thing is for sure: no one is going to write a good monograph on Wong Kar-Wai who thinks that In the Mood for Love is cold and uninvolving."
4,Awesome graphics and gameplay. Terrible commentary.,"I bought this game after playing the demo. The graphics are the best out of all the football games out right now. I have never been a fan of Madden, but have been a fan of the NFL 2K series. The gameplay is comparable to the NFL 2k series. The only reason NFL Fever got a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star rating is because of the commentary. IT IS TERRIBLE! The voices are monotonous and they sound like robots. If commentary isnt very important to you, then buy this game. I love it!"
1,Warning,"Whatever you do, do not buy this game. All the other reveiwers who gave this game a 4 or a 5, must work for Microsoft. This game sucked sooooo bad, I played only one full game, and returned it for credit for another game. The graphics are horrible. The players are too cartooney and too buff. The fat players look like Slimer from the Ghostbusters. The tackling is atrocious, and the kicking is a joke. The players when they run look like midgets because of the big upper bodies, and the small legs. If I didn't already have Madden on PS2, I would get it for XBOX. Save your cash and and get Madden or even NFL 2k2. Hell tecmo bowl would beat this game."
2,There's no 2-player mode??,"I love playing video games of all variety against my roommates. So, when I read the multi-player mode to this game was fun, I bought it. However, I was horribly dissappointed to discover that as far as I can tell, there is no 2-player mode to this game!! I couldn't care less about playing against the computer. To me, video games are a socially competitive thing. If I can't turn to the guy next to me and say, ""IN YOUR FACE!!"" what's the point? If you really want to play football against a computer, buy my copy because of course, after opening the package, I couldn't return it!"
3,"better graphics, same old football game","If you've gotten tired of the same old console football game (like I have) this game offers very little new in the way of gameplay. It has some interesting features (fantasy stadiums, etc) and much better graphics than its predecessors - but it is not a major leap above the older games. I would recommend this game if you are a die-hard football gaming fan (madden lover, etc) - but if you are a game player more interested in immediate gratification (DoA3, NHL Hitz) like myself, I doubt you'll find this game very interesting - I didn't. After renting it at the video store, I couldn't take more than an hour of NFL Fever 2002 before moving on to the other games that I had rented."
5,great and asome,i thought the game very asome wheh i boght it i coundet stop playing it that how exciting it was
3,It ain't Madden,"Well I bought this with my Xbox, and I wish I would've got Madden. This game looks great, really nice visuals. The commentary just plain [...]; if I hear the color commentary guy call a play ""sweet"" one more time, I'm gonna puke. The AI just isn't the same quality as EA Sports. Case in point. Playing the computer, you can actually call an audible for the same play you called in the huddle and the defense totally changes plays and you can score an easy TD. I may be trading this one in for Madden soon..."
3,Locked Clock Kills a Good Game,"Picked up Fever on launch day. Played a couple games last night and I was pretty impressed. Graphically it really is top notch and while I've not had it long enough to find ways to exploit the AI, so far it's provided a couple of entertaining games. But there is a very unfortuante game killer:In Dynasty mode you are REQUIRED to play with *5 minute* quarters. (the otion to change is there, but it's locked out)This just kills the game as you cannot generate an accurate number of plays in just 20 minutes. If you play a run-oriented offense there's no way your RB will accumulate 20 carries in a game unless you *never* pass the ball, and even then I'm thinking that would be a challenge. That's just not football.I'm no fan of EA Sports (for poor customer relations reasons), but I may end up taking this back for Madden or waiting for NFL2k2. 5 minute quarters just doesn't cut it."
2,I Hated This Book,"I needed this book last semester for my psychology class and this book was bland and boring. It was extremely hard to get into,and I have plans on selling this item back ASAP. Good Riddens."
2,"Large portion devoted to the ""evolution"" of the world","This book would be great if so much of the book wasn't devoted to our supposed ""evolution"". I expected some sprinkling of evolution, but I didn't expect such a huge emphasis! An entire section is devoted to this topic alone. Wish I had known this before I bought it."
5,Bought for my kids and I can't put it down!,"This is a well-written resource that I think should be a part of every collection. I find that everyone in the family (including myself) opens it to look up one thing and then ends up reading page after page for enjoyment. (Yes, we are kinda geeky like that!)The book is well-organized and indexed. It include color coding to indicate the region of the world where the events took place and timelines on almost every page. The book also includes bits of science and a lot of culture which helps to make it both well-rounded and intriguing. Although it is intended as a reference book, it contains enough interesting information and gorgeous pictures to make it enjoyable reading.My son who reads on a 2nd grade level is able to read much of the book and is not intimidated by it -which is partly due to a nice (comfortable) font size and the illustrations on every page.I am THRILLED with our purchase of this book!"
5,A must for every John Ford movie buff!,"Dobe Carey grew up in the Hollywood world of cowboys and giant stars. He never lost his awe. He reveals the off-camera characters of the members of the John Ford stock company. He also reveals Ford's sense of practical jokes and mercurial anger. If you love John Wayne, Ward Bond, Ben Johnson, and the rest, read this book."
2,Not what I expected for the Xbox.,"WWF: Raw is War for the Xbox is not what I expected the graphics is good and it is great when it first comes on all the fireworks at the beginning of the game. There is 2 things that is real bad about this game. 1 is no matches except single in the championsip mode. They could have put a cage match in once in a while. No2 is the controls suck. When you grapple your opponent 75% of the time he will headbut you in the stomach or the opponent will hit you before you grapple them and this is in the easy mode. The controls just suck, you have to play it to kniow what I'm talking about. If you can rent or play this game before you buy it do it. You might save some money. I love wrestling, but this is a not a good game. I hate to say it but, WWF Smackdown: Just Bring It for the playstation 2 is alot better game than this one."
4,Very good game.... nothing like raw 2 though,"This is a very fun game except for some few things. First Jeff Hardy can't even climb up a ladder (come on thats all he does.) Second, you you cant jumb on poeple withough them actually rolling over.In Raw 2 you can do all those plus you can be +60 wrestlers.(go to www.teamxbox.com to find out about raw 2.)"
1,"Why no ""0 stars"" option for this game?","This game [stinks]. Super-slow, lame controls, about as fun as programming your vcr. What a waste of money. Buyer beware."
1,THis Game [Stinks],this game is horrible! if it wasnt for the graphics this gamewould have nothing. the controls are to hard and the crowd decides if u get ur special. every time u beet up the guy the crowd hates u. theres not enough people. on sm3 they have way more peeps and way more matches like hell in a cell and cage tlc ladder table ultimate submission. i just bought raw is war for x-box (...) yesterday and i'm taking it back today. so if u have a ps2 sm3 is the game for u!!!! Sm3 u can create taunts and things like that. basically what i am saying is that raw needs some help i will wait till raw 2 at least they might have hell in a cell.
2,The sorriest xbox game yet,Ok this game started off good with the over 30 wwf superstarsand the great entrances but not so good gameplay you got to keepmashing A to do a move and most of the time the computer countersdrops you on the floor and then it takes forever to get back up.sometimes this game is to real for its owm good.Another thing theysay you can fight in the crowd but you cant or go backstage.sothats a real drawback not to say this game has less matches thenLegends of wrestling.All in all this game diserved 2 stars for the entrances and the good quality of wrestlers.
1,thq [isn't good],"THIS GAME [IS] REALLY [BAD} BECAUSE THERE IS NO TABLE,LADDER, OR ANY OTHER GOOD MODES IN THIS GAME. THQ SHOULD BE SORRY FOR SWICTHING TO ACHOR FOR DOING THE GAME!!!...."
1,the worst wrestling game ever made.,"It looks great, but the game playing is horrible. I drove all around town in search of this game to rent it, finally I find it, Im so excited to play this very hyped game. Get home to play and thats exactly what this game is, HYPE. Im am so dissapointed in THQ, they have made way better wrestling games then this. True that this is the platform wrestling game for Xbox, but WCW vs. NWO World Tour was the platform for N64 and is better then RAW.No season mode!....Wrestlemania 2000 had the sweetest season mode, now if they could do it again on Xbox, only have multipul years and career choices.Hope this helps some one, thank you for you time."
3,Disappointing,"Being a huge fan of playing wrestling video games and after being addicted to the N64 ""No Mercy"" game for the past year and a half, I am very disappointed with ""Raw"" for X-box. There is no tag team championship belt, there are only 4 hidden wrestlers (3 out of 4 being the McMahans with the forth being some unknown created character). There is no storylines like in No Mercy or anything. And this game is suppose to be the hottest thing going? I've seen a better create a character menu on N64 WWF Attitude. I think this game was rushed out the door due to THQ having to reschedule the release date three times since last year. I truly hope that they do a lot better on Wrestlemania 2002 that's suppose to come out this summer."
4,"Most say bad, I say good","This game is not the best overall but its alot of fun.My friends always comeover to play it.It needs:Cage Matchand aLatter MatchIt doesn't have a good 1player mode, but if you just want fun, here it is."
2,So so,"This game is okay but were is season, who the hells haku wheres blood?! nothing good about this game u cant climb ladders and it almost imposibble to win titles!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! u cant save ethier this game blows"
2,About WWF Raw,This really isnt a review but i just got the game the other day and i want to know how to play the songs on my hard drive of it as entrance songs plz help send e-mails to greatsaiyamunkey2003@yahoo.com
3,Crashes!!!!,"This game is very fun except for one reason. The reason being is that when the superstars come either the music stops and the game freezes, or when the credits at the begining of the game stop and the game once again freezes."
1,it can be better,"raw for xbox is by far the worst wwf game there is. the only good thing about it is the graphics,the game play ... and a blind ... monkey could have made better and the only reson i gave it a 1 was because how good the people looked. it is hard to do a special ,... it is hard to grapple people and to do any moves and i say werstling for the orignal sega is betterfrom the bestviperboy"
5,This is the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is so the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you could have some new charectors and you could get people from WCW!!!!!!!! you might not get a story mode but you still are able to get a title belt. so I suggest you buy this game.
2,Great Graphics and THATS IT!!!!,"Like the review below no season mode, only a few game matches. The graphics will be the best in the buisness. Thats all the XBOX has. This game has no sence of getting but what it has is......nothing. If you want a game that has ove 75 match types, 45 wrestlers, good graphics not GREAT, 8 venues to fight in, many backstage areas, GET SMACKDOWN 3 for the PS2. ONE MORE thing, you all might remember Raw Is War for the N64, it had better than the original Smackdown, BUT the plyers moved slow like in this game (Raw Is War). If you like graphics fet this game, but if you like games get another wrestling game."
3,backstage where?,"Everything they promised but where are the 10 backstage areas which they continue to include in the ads and reviews? I heard that they were removed by THQ last minute. Also, where is the blood on the wrestlers/mat? Colors, gestures, liknesses, entrance music, all very good."
5,Very Good Experience,Easy to do business with. My product arrived way before the anticipated date. Would do business again with them.
3,"A good tale, but could have been told in < 606 pages!","This is a very interesting fantasy. The characters eventually come alive, but this book is entirely too long. This story could well have been told, and told well, in 200 to 300 pages, rather than the 606 the author used. There is enough here, however, to lead me to read Sea without a Shore, vol. 2 of the saga."
3,Not a History Book; More an Overview of US Black Ops Policy,"...which made it tiresome and a bit frustrating to read. I was hoping/expecting more details on the nature of the operations themselves. I agree with the author that the use of black ops is a clear policy of the US, and there are far-reaching effects as a result. But that is more of the ""why"". If you want more of the ""how"", read elsewhere.BTW this is not to say that this is a poorly written book. It is very engaging especially for those unfamiliar with the subjects and the history behind various operations. But be aware that this is more of a book aimed at a college level course - ie provoking discussions - than being semi-sensationalistic."
2,azurik-save your money,"dont buy this, wait for better games, save your money...linear gameplay, annoying enemies take to long to kill and regenerate when you die or reload from save, with cheats its better cause you can save anywhere, but its still ... . get xbox rpg morrowind instead."
3,I'll give it a good review,"I actually am going to give this game a good review. But first I'll agree with the rest of you on what is wrong with it. The graphics aren't great, the enemies are extremely unintelligent, and most of it is pretty unbelieveable (and yes, he's blue.)The good part? I thought it was really fun. I'll admit that I don't have alot of patience, and in a few places it was pretty rough, but over all I thought it was really fun. Don't expect great graphics or movement, but it has interesting worlds and levels and the premise (which you can find out by reading above) is pretty unique and interesting."
4,I Thought It Was Cool,"I rented several games when i first bought my xbox to get a feel for the system and see what the capablities of the system were like. I think the developers did a great job developing the worlds and characters. I must agree that u can get frustrated with the controls but the game will capture our attention for some hours if you like RPG's. I rented Halo, Azurik, and bought Max Payne,I tired to get one of every genre, and I think that you must try it before you diss it. For me it's worth buying or at least renting just to look at the graphics."
1,THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE,"Azurik is a terrible game. It is boring, has a very bad plot and the whole game is just.....stupid. (C'mon, you go around fighting polka-dotted lizards and looking for crystals as a blue guy who looks like the adult version of Skeeter from the cartoon Doug) Do not waste your time or money on this game. Before I played it I thought it was going to be a great game, I read previews and good reviews. I was very, very wrong. The only redeeming quality of this game is the graphics, it might be fun for some people, but I could barely play for 10 minutes. Ugh. This game could have been great (it had the potential) but it just turns out badly. Spend your money on great games like Halo, Dead Or Alive 3, Project Gotham Racing, NFL Fever 2002 etc. But you don't have to listen to me, rent it if you must and see for yourself. But remember, I warned you........"
4,Better than I thought,"This a low budget film with a Christian focus, I was not expecting much and w/o a doubt the lead actress is not the best with her acting, but I found the story to be very cute and actually liked the film. I think the overriding theme is acceptance and not being put into a box based on others expectations of you. And trutfully the attitude of what a ""christian"" woman should be held by the brother in the film is all to often reality. Not bad considering the obvious low budget."
4,don't judge a cd by its cover,its pretty damn good. it sounds like old bury your dead and new remembering never. it will blow you away guaranteed. but it now damn it!
5,Great!,I bought this for a client who loves to travel and who loves pink. Se was over the top about the gift and was thrilled to have a new passport wallet to carry.
3,disappointed,"The picture shown for the item was of 8 Disney characters. This was misleading, because only one pack of 2 was shipped. I had no idea that a choice of characters would be made for me. My grandson was not thrilled to get 2 female characters, when he wanted Pluto and Goofy. Had I known he would not receive what was shown, I would not have ordered this. The price was more than retail when just receiving two characters."
2,Pills are too big...,"...so the dog won't eat them. He finds it in the food and eats around it. If you break it up, he smells it and then won't eat at all!"
1,Don't buy this if you value your acrylic aquarium.,"Regardless of what the manufacturer says, this will scratch your acrylic aquarium. I followed the directions and fortunately started near the back of my display tank. The scratches were immediate and ugly!I deeply regret not having heeded the advice of others."
5,Thrash's triumphant comeback?,"I dunno how well this album sold, but it's probably the LAST great thrash metal album (lemme know if there are any others, guys) Not just because thrash is almost an extinct genre these days but because this album's going to be very hard to top. Everything from Crush to a Toast to the Extras to the really short snippety stuff like Cupajoe (which sounds almost SOD-esque) is fantastic, powerful thrash. It may lack the brilliant tempo changes of earlier anthrax albums and none of the songs are as instantly likeable as Belly of the Beast or Make Me Laugh for instance. But that's more than made up for by the great rhythms, wry, witty lyrics, above average drumming and excellent vocals (I think John Bush finally found his voice on this album... didn't care much for him on Stomp or White Noise) Oh yeah, the lyric booklet is well-presented too, it looks like 50's B-movie poster. Get this album if you like thrash and (like me) mourn its passing."
4,"Apology in the doctor-patient relationship, etc","I picked ""On Apology"" up at the Oxford University Press table at a conference, The American Society for Bioethics and Humanities, and was riveted by it. Lazare discusses if (and how) a doctor should make an apology to a patient (there's much to consider, such as potential litigation). But, I found basically helpful the defined ingredients in an apology, how it's a negotation, and examples of many types of apologies, from his own (parent to child) to national, e.g. Clinton to the nation (both on Monica Lewinsky and to the survivors of the Tuskegee syphillis experiment). I hope teachers, of all types and at all levels, will learn about apology and teach their students. This would be an enormous gift."
5,Love Junior phonics!,Fantastic for the homeschooling family or to help out a struggling public school child. This set taught my daughter how to read. She loved the video's and all the games you can play. I started with it when she was 4. It taught her the alphabet and beginning sounds of all the letters.
2,Nice but flawed,"This is a very nice spatula with one serious drawback. I left it lying on the stove, with the oven turned on to 250 degrees, and all the plastic melted away from the metal frame and lay in a black puddle on the stove top! This hasn't ever happened to me with a utensil before. Just so you know, if you buy this the handle needs special care. Bummer."
3,Pretty Good,This conditioner is Ok but I will not order again because there is conditioner in the big box store that are just as good.
1,Yuck!!!,"Okay... so it worked ok as far as a conditioner... But MAN IT Smells AWFULL! Definitely will not buy this product again, However Same Company Same Volumizing But says ""COTOUR"". Works and smells Awesome. Every opinion is different Perhaps someone else may tolerate the smell."
4,Very Pleased,These items Monroe 901923/901924 are the correct item for the third gen Camaro. The pictures in the ad are not accurate. They have a heavier bearing than stock but the OEM dust cover does not fit. We did as most others and went with out one. Overall great product at a great price.
2,Japanese Version,This is the Japanese version. The actual cover doesn't even look like the preview. This is my second attempt to buy the original movie version BEFORE Disney 'mastered' it and removed most of the sound track.
1,ridiculous to use the name Beherit,"this is about as far removed from the sounds of Beherit...it's a disgrace to even call it the same name and use the same logo. I don't know what happened with Holocausto, but this album isn't even metal, let alone black metal. Sure bands like Abruptum, Burzum, Black Funeral and a few others have pushed the boudaries (and sometimes crossed them), but just because Slayer said Evil has no Boundaries, doesn't mean a band can perform a synth record and still call it the same name.""Drawing Down the Moon"" and ""The Oath of Black Blood"" are all the Beherit anyone needs."
2,"Brief, Lame, Unrewarding","A likely more fruitful use of your money and time is ""The Elements of Style"" by Strunk and White."
3,Ballerina Croc Review,"Comfortable, but my feet make noise when I walk. If you can adjust to that, they are great!"
1,What a disappointment,These shoes while cute were not anywhere near the comfort zone of the original croc shoe and sandhal.They will not stay on your heel and you continually walk out of them. What a shame. I have sent them back.
1,Twisted on feet,I wore these after after swimming I was still dripping so there was water in the shoes. Besides the squeaking which is just annoying I will not be wearing the shoes again. I got out of the car and the road had a sharp angle on the edge where I stepped and my feet rotated in the shoes. The shoes stayed on the road but my whole body just rotated. I only stayed off the ground because I grabbed the car. I had to pick up my foot to twist the shoe around again. I have never had that happen with any other shoes ever in my life. Flip flops you might slide off and maybe the original crocs also but I thought these were really bad.
4,Anne Klein,"The Anne Kleine Ladies watch I ordered is elegant, however the bracelet is rather short for my wrist, It is better for the bracelet to be longer as it is easier to adjust."
4,A lesson on reading the fine print of a book description...,"When I bought the book I thought I was getting the prayers of the Divine Office itself. Instead this is a book on its importance. An interesting read but not what I thought I was getting. But hey, it was free so who can complain?"
1,Terrible Sound,"Inexpensive powered Speakers meant for listening not enjoying. Absolutely no fidelity to the sound. Muffled with no presence, no high end to speak of. If you listen to audio books these would do. Not sure what else. Currently looking for something better for a little turntable and pre-amp set up. If these were my only speakers they would have been dumped in the trash can a while back."
3,Quality control issues...,"Sound nice when they work.First set had to be returned because of loud crackling noise when the main speaker was moved. Second set had bad input cable. Worked fine until the first time I had to move the computer, then it crackled and lost one channel repeatedly. I suspect that the input cable was a problem on the first set as well and wonder if these folks are just skimping a little too much on this part of the system."
3,"Decent speakers, crappy base",Decent set of speakers for the price. Do the job as monitoring speakers. Very nice to have amplifier in this small package. I noticed that the lower frequencies are kind of lacking clarity and are of somewhat crappy quality. Rest is great!
1,JUNK,I would not recommend theses speaker as they only lasted 4 months. I made the mistake of not registering them within 30 days. (MY BAD) Lesson learned so now I have speakers that sound crackley and low volume for awhile then it clears up and sounds fine for a few minutes back and for with no random pattern. Iwas not overly impressed with the speakers even new. Back to my 8 year old speakers that came free with my old dell computer. Once again junk.
1,Worked for maybe an hour... hooray!,"So I was so excited to get these in the mail and set them up with my home recording equipment. After going through all the trouble of setting them up exactly how I wanted them they stopped working completely after maybe and hour of playing some tracks with my guitar. In the middle of me laying down a track the speakers lost all power and would not produce any sound. I checked the fuse... good to go... so I unplugged everything and tried them in another power outlet with the same result. Needless to say I was very disappointed and if I can't even lay down some tracks with my guitar then I don't want it. I don't even know if these would be good computer speakers let alone recording monitors... If your on a budget spend the extra $50 to $100 bucks and get something better, trust me it'll be worth it."
5,Wow!,"There's not really a need for me to go on and on given the number of reviews for these speakers, but suffice it to say these are a tremendous purchase for a lousy $140. Upgrading computer speakers was the best idea I've had in a while. They feel, look, and sound like the real deal. They come with speaker stand pads and also a handy manual for setting them up for the best listening experience. Buy these with full confidence.I would also suggest picking up Samson MS200 Pro monitor stands to go with these as well. They're around $80 for a pair and fit the AV40's perfectly. They're also simple to adjust to the optimum height for listening."
1,Maybe I got a lemon?,"These speakers were fine when I was listening to my itunes off of my macbook, but when i started to use my Numark mixer, and Traktor scratch pro...nothing but distortion. I'm think that my set up is somehow messed up? I don't know. I guess I'll have to figure it out if I can, if not these are going right back. If anybody has any info to help make these speakers sound better with my mixer pls let me know. Thanks!!"
4,Fixed the poor sound on my flat screen TV,"I bought these powered speakers to improve the muddy sound on my 46"" flat-screen TV. So far, they've done all I wanted and give me crisp sound with nice, even response. I can actually understand spoken words from across the room. They're well made, fit nicely into my room like bookshelf speakers, and the color even matches my other equipment. Only time will tell how long they last.On a technical note... The TV I have offers ""variable audio out"" so hookup was a snap. Many models do NOT, and I used this criteria in my selection so I would have the option to use external speakers. I also used a ""smart"" outlet box to power them so that when I turn off the TV, it powers down other accessories like these speakers. For quiet listening, a wireless headset plugs into the headphone jack on the front, muting the speakers. I'm pleased with how the system works, and am satisfied with my choice."
3,Lush sound - but the amp can be a buzz kill,"These speakers sound great right out of the box. For the money, it would be hard to find something that sounds as full and detailed. However, The speakers do have two flaws:1 - minor issue - they are rather big for desktop speakers2 - major issue - the amp buzzes on some sets. I am driven crazy by electrical hums and the set I ordered was sent back because of a buzz when the speakers weren't playing. Apparently, this is a hit or miss issue with the AV 40's. Caveat Emptor..."
3,"Good, but subwoofer needed","These speakers will be a big step up from your typical powered speakers meant for use with computers (logitech, altec-lansing, etc). Dynamics and clarity are good, and the treble response brings a nice presence to music (although they're somewhat unforgiving of harsh/bright sound mixes).Rated down to 85hz (and that probably means -3db at 85hz), these fall more into the category of satellite speaker rather than bookshelf. The bass is weak enough that even the lower mid-range is affected somewhat, with male vocals sounding a bit thin. IMHO they're inadequate for most music in a 2.0 setup.I have a feeling these speakers can sound very good when paired with a subwoofer. M-Audio makes asubwooferthat would probably work well with them, but it costs more than three times as much as the AV-40's, so the value proposition is questionable.Since I was wanting something for music playback without a sub, I decided to return these."
3,"Good sounding, but has a background hum","I'm using these speakers for my computer, so I'm kind of close to them. I am pleased with the frequency response, but I'm disappointed that they have background hum. It's most noticeable when it's quiet. The hum doesn't change with the volume setting so I suspect these speakers may have a power-supply filter-design problem."
3,Heavy and overrated.,"I am sorry but I disagree with the other reviewers here regarding the sound quality of these speakers.Yes, the bass is good and the music has body but the mid to highs is muffled and not very detailed.Pros: Can play loud with decent, if not well defined bass.Cons: these are essential near field monitors. What that means is that they have to position rightin front of you to get the best sound. They are fairly heavy and as such not very portable.In my opinion if you going to go this way yo might as well, get a decent amp and decent pair of book self speakers.I have basically given up trying to find a decent computer speaker :)"
5,aunruh,The AV-40's are great value speakers. One would be hard pressed to find better sound for the price of a pair of these. Turned my laptop to a very respectable sound system. Highly recomended for anyone that is looking for bookshelf speakers with super sound. Would be perfect for students living in dorms or small apts.
2,Great Hardcopy...Bad E-book!!!,"I have the hard copy of this in my library and it is a truly valuable work. That said, the e-book has been poorly done. Not only are the words written in the Thai alphabet so small they can barely be read, but many of the transliterated words are incorrect. Many of the transliterated words ending in ""ng"" are missing the final ""g"". This results in the Thai verb ""song"" (to send) becoming ""son"" and the verb ""long"" (to descend) becoming ""lon"". You guys really need to fix this. These mistakes in converting the hardcopy to e-book format are giving a great book a bad reputation (and confusing Thai language students in the process)."
4,Michele Watch,"Great watch for a great price. Everything about the watch and the condition were great except for the fact that I later learned that Michele will only service watches that were sold by authorized dealers. Not a big likelyhood that I'll need to get it fixed anytime soon but just something to keep in mind as this watch seller is not an authorized dealer. You can only get the servicing throught the amazon watch seller but you can't beat this price ANYWHERE! trust me, i looked everywhere for a better price and this was by far the lowest. :)"
5,Good Buy,"This is emotional and good. I do not think you will ever regret buying this. For the cost, take the chance and enjoy a good movie."
4,FaithLike Potatoes-movie,This movie has a really good story line but parts of it are boring. I really wanted to see it though and it had a great price. I'd recommend it but you have to watch out for the slow parts.
5,Loved this movie!,"The movie is ostensibly about having the faith to grow potatoes in a drought in South Africa, and that part of it, I didn't really get. But the part about this movie that I absolutely loved was the depiction of the main character's conversion. It was so beautiful. I replayed it several times. After watching the movie, I then watched the documentary showing the real-life farmer who inspired the movie. I had never heard of him, but it was easy to see how he could inspire others to have faith--a very likeable, gentle person. There was also one other pivotal point in the movie and the documentary that deeply touched me, but I don't want to spoil it for you. I will just say that this movie is definitely worth watching with the whole family. You will not regret it."
2,anti-climatic,I couldn't wait to see this movie. The advertisements were great. The advertisements were also the best part of this movie. It was a great story but anti-climatic. It's worth the price of a rental but not the price of purchase. I will probably donate my copy to my church library.
4,must see,Amazing true life of a amazing person and his walk with the lord. A must see for all christian and also non christian.
3,Overall a rather boring movie,"I admit that I fell asleep before the end. It was a nice little story but it was very slow and a little disjointed. I also couldn't understand why the wife/mother in this poor farming family always looked like she was ready to pose for the cover of Good Housekeeping. Though the rest of the family were dressed and groomed like a poor farming family, she rarely did. She just seemed out of place."
4,Song writers,"If you like song writing then you must like Burt Bachrach, if you like Burt Bachrach then you must love 75% of this CD....and when you listen to Alfie you must say....no one can write anything better than that! Words and music at the top of writing!"
3,This is NOT the Dimples Movie Soundtrack,"This is NOT the Movie Soundtrack from the movie Dimples.This CD is yet another COMPILATION from several of Shirley's films.Every song on this CD except The World Owes Me A Living is on: Stand Up and Cheer, America's Sweetheart, and/or Oh My Goodness.It sure would be easier if every song was in one - four CD box set."
4,black sabbath best of,this album is worth it's weight in gold The tracks are great and it's very hard to find (because it's out of print) get it while you can
4,Appears to be a good collection...,"However, most significantly, it's missing the song Solitude from Master of Reality. I just wanted to take this opporunity to dote on that underappreciated mood-piece, thanks."
4,Organized and precious....,"I am pretty shocked by finding this book as the only one connecting ancient Egypt and winery. And, the most interesting part is the author happens to be my teacher. Yet, the above fact is not the reason that makes the book interesting.The book described in detail the role that wine played in ancient religion and the archaeology findings about how ancient Egyptian produce wine. Also, the materials were strictly and abundantly reffered from early papers with different languages. All in all, it is very useful.However, as a student of science, I was hoping to find more information about how the weather or the types of terrain, for example, the pH value, affect the growing of grape trees. And, couldn't be satisfied with this only book."
3,Not bad for the price,"Aside from looking like a Heathkit project (faceplate color scheme), this amp is a good value for the money. It sounds nice and offers a host of inputs. The preset EQ settings work better than adjusting the bass and treble control manually. The drawbacks include (as mentioned earlier) the faceplate isn't that eye-appealing and I wished that a balance control and second speaker outputs were incorporated in the unit. Overall this amp sounds great!"
1,Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications,"The book is well organized. Explanations seem to be clear, but they are too basic. The problems are good, if the book explained how to work them. It is a book for the experienced in Discrete Math, not for someone who is learning Discrete for the first time. I did not like nor enjoy math for the first time when I had to study from this book. Also, it is overprice for what the book offers. Universities should not require it."
2,"good source for problems, but hard to learn from","I used Rosen's book for a Discrete Math course given at the sophomore level. If I had to sum this book up in few words, I would say, Short on explanations and examples, but long on exercises. I almost gave this book 3 stars because of the abundance of problems, but with the poor exposition and simple examples, I just couldn't in good conscience. My advice is to find another book from which to learn, but check out the problems to enhance your knowledge."
1,childish,"This book has the flavor of a grade school textbook. It's very frivolous, and in fact, while I was reading it, I developed quite an aversion for discrete math. I thought of it as a pointless subject.But luckily, I later discovered that set theory and graph theory are quite interesting, to say nothing of boolean algebra and state machines. So I'd conclude that this book was at fault. It presents the topics in a dry and uninspired manner, enough to turn anyone off. What's unfortunate is that instructors (who don't think about students when evaluating books) adore it's neat little layout, which does nothing to promote learning.This book is corny and not rigorous at all. A very kindergraten level approach."
3,Thank god,"I personally find all mathematics texts to be horrific thankfully my professor never made us use the book. He taught the course through hand outs of notes and lecture. I had to open this book only once (he usually just said do as much of the homework as you feel you need to, but one time he did decide to collect it.) I have to say it was a rather poor experience. Several of the problems had no even remotely clear examples."
4,Breakin Funk for you Ghetto Blaster,This album rocks!! Breakbeat funk leaning towards Hip Hop!! A must for fans of The Freestylers or Fatboy Slim!! Songs to check out are Pagnini-Wildstyle and Freestylers- Back 2 99
2,A Passion for Flavor,This book seemed to have potential for explaining how to make infused vinegars and oils - but it was a disappointment - it only shows recipes in all the standard categories using them. There are no recipes for infusions.
2,disappointment,"Aimable is my favorite accordianist, but this was just of repeat of a CD already owned but with different songs."
5,All parents should be required to view this documentary,"This is a must for all parents! I believe that most parents do not realize what their middle school children are going through or have available to them. Times have changed drastically! This movie is almost scary to watch at times, but the knowledge gained from it can be very valuable. It will help gain understanding of the various peer pressures and problems that our teenagers today are facing on a daily basis."
2,"A dry, tedious read","Although the subject is fascinating and the author's background make him eminently qualified to tell us about a little-known and little-understood people, this book is not a compelling read. The first 100 pages (all I was able to finish) do provide some interesting historical background, but not enough detail to make that history come to life. The focus then shifts to an excruciatingly detailed report on the aftermath of the Gulf War. Perhaps if this narrative had been better organized and clearer, the torrent of names and places might have made more sense. Most readers who want to learn more about the Kurds should look for a more accessible work."
1,Difficult,"This book is extremely difficult to understand. Examples used are repeated throughout every page of the book and it doesn't make much sense. I believe the person who wrote the book understands it (I hope) and anyone that owns a company may. If you are a free-lancer, this book is not for you."
3,3 stars,"The Bible contains hundreds of prophecies, and not all of the related to eschatology. Thus, it is quite important to understand prophecy to be able to comprehend the Scriptures. From Genesis through Revelation, the authors take readers on a tour of both foretelling and forthtelling words. In the process, readers are given insights into ancient life and vocabulary that can be useful in understanding other parts of the Bible. It is worth noting that while there will be little contraversy regarding how Misters LaHaye and Hindson discuss prophecies not related to the end times, their views on that finale of human history are, not unexpectedly, Premil Dispensational. This may be problematic for Amill, Postmill, Preterist, and so on readers.Amanda Killgore"
1,Catchy toy but the remote is useless,"My son loves this toy, and the mirror works good enough BUT the remote is useless. I replaced the batteries twice thinking they were dead. The instructions tell you to hit the button on the toy once and that activates the remote, but that has NEVER worked for us. I instructions with the toy say do not return to store call Baby Einstein. I should have ignored them and returned it. I contacted Baby Einstein and they referred me to the manufacturer (Kids II I think that was). Not worth the effort. I just use it manually when I place my son in the car and it plays for quite awhile."
2,What remote?,"I will echo what the other reviewers have said. The remote is useless, and I'm not sure why they even bothered including it. The positives are that it's not annoying for adults and seems to have a great deal of potential, but my baby chooses to ignore it for some reason. I'm sure there has to be something better out there."
1,unsafe & unimpressive,"I had this mirror in my car for over 2 months until today. Not once did it ever work correctly. Come to find out it is also a safety hazard! I went to the Sherriff's office today for a car seat check and she was very much against having the mirror in my car. She said it is considered a 'projectile' & that children in wrecks usually have their faces injured by such mirrors. Needless to say, we took it down right then. Buyer beware!"
5,Worked in less than a week,"I homeschool and my two boys 5 and 3 have been reading a bit. After watching all three Meet the Sight Words DVDs they have learned all the sight words in just a couple of viewings. It has given them more confidence in reading and definitely more speed. I did buy the flash cards on my iPad which they enjoy playing with, and the easy reader books which are fabulous. The books really are a confidence booster when used with the videos. Thank you for such a wonderful product. Hopefully there will be some more sight words DVDs on the horizon."
2,Not very engaging,"This video is nice, however, it isn't as engaging for our child as I thought it was going to be."
3,2 year old not much into it,"My 2 year old daughter who loved PreSchool Prep's Meet the Letters, Numbers, Colors & Shapes is not much into this one. I guess I have to wait for her to get a little older to enjoy this one."
1,Not as captivating as I was hoping,I was hoping this would be a great learning tool for my pre-schooler. She gave it about 5 minutes before she walked out of the room requesting a new movie. Oh well. I think a younger child might be more interested in this DVD.
3,Sight Words Video,"Overall this is a nice dvd but my 5 year old twin boys thought it was very boring, but with some bribery, they sat through it. Honestly, I found it boring too. I think this dvd would best suit 2-4 year olds. However, one of my twins learned all his sight words after viewing this movie 1 time. So overall, it was worth the money to me."
5,Great movies for helping kids recognize words,"These have helped my son get excited about reading and recognizing words. They keep the attention of my 1 year old, too."
3,brother is an aerosmith fanatic,needed a gift for the brother and this seem to fit the bill. A little pricey but seems to be of good quality.
4,Great Sheets for the price,"These are great sheets! As one other reviewer said, they are too big, which is fine for me since I hate having sheets come untucked while I am sleeping. I am going to buy another set soon for a backup!The only problem is even if you follow the directions for laundering on the package, they do shrink. They are still big, but I wonder how long that will last with the shrinkage."
2,Not as good as other Rankins,"I won't bore you with a synposis of the book. This is the 3rd Rankin book I have listened to. Robert Rankin does a wonderful job of performing his book; his reading is as delightful as the other books. However, the story isn't as delightful as the performance. The story meanders and goes on and on until I really didn't care how it ended, just please end. If I could have gotten to the library to replace it, I would have stopped listening, but it was better than nothing on my long drives. I'm glad I didn't pay for this book. I don't really know how Rankin feels about the concept of time travel. He's used it before in his books, but in this one, he seems to be poking fun at the concept since there's so many overlaps and switches. Who's when and why? There are many laughs in the first half book, but they don't make up for this overlong story."
4,better then the origanal,"This game is meant for4-9 year olds and that's how they set up the format, simple and easy. It has better graphics new players and a few new fields what does that make a better then the origanal sequal. But that's not all you don't have to be in the age group to enjoy it, you can be older. If your older you should beet this game in about 3 hours tops. But still it's a great game and if you have a younger sibling buy it for them and you can enjoy it."
1,Give me a goood game man...,"What is this? Junk. When i borrowed this game from my friend I leant it right back saying, this game is worthless. You do nothing. And the score ends up to be like 10, 11, which is unrealistik. Stupid and borring. For one thing, there's someone playing soccer who's in a wheelchair.Maybe you can use power ups, but those are dumb. If you want a good game i would reccomend FIfa 2001 by five stars."
3,One track is blinding.,"This is the most easy to find from the AB series. There are only one very good track: Cuckoo, which is a vulvatic tune. I like it! Knievel, and Elephant Song are a little wierd. The rest is OK. An avarage Aphex-song."
5,Healthy and growing,"Ordered four of these and got them delivered speedily and in good health. They have been in the ground for a few months now and all four seem to be growing nice and healthy, enough so to face the coming cold winter months."
3,You get what you pay for.,"The price was right and the sound wasn't bad for what was I was buying. It was light weight, mobile, and added a little bass my PA's were missing. Only problem is 2 months in capacitors started breaking and all sorts of parts are loose inside, sill works some how, just doesn't seem to hit as hard anymore."
5,ALWAYS SATISFIED WITH AMAZON,"I EXPECT SATISFACTION WITH MY PURCHASES, THAT IS THE MAIN REASON WHY I ORDER FROM AMAZON.MY EXPECTIONS OF FAST SHIPPING, REASONABLE PRICING, QUALITY, AND GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE ARE ALWAYS MEET AND OFTEN EXCEEDED, I WILL ALWAYS ORDER FROM AMAZON.THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING YOUR SERVICES.SINCERELY JEFF LAWS"
4,Good Gardner,"Martin Gardner has written a number of great books over the years. This, while not his best, still shows off his strengths.Unlike some of his recent books that are dedicated primarily to debunking various paranormal events, this book is mostly a collection of reviews of various books and authors. There is also some amusing diversions such as a chapter filled with word play.For an introduction to Gardner, this may not be the best book since it doesn't focus on either debunking or mathematical recreations, which is where he does his best work. For Gardner fans, however, this should not be a disappointment."
5,ONE OF THE BEST!,This CD is one of the best gypsy jazz albums. The Schmitts are outstanding and you can really hear Patrick Saussois' influence.Patrick's DJAZ label always has the best sound and this album is exceptional. Alma Sinti fans will really enjoy this album.
1,Giving Jesus a bad name...again.,"In the spirit of those same so-called Christians who built Auschwitz and Buchenwald, we have here a panoply of hatred and intolerance straight from that icon of the U.S. evangelical movement, Colson the Creepy.If, like so many on the religious ""right"", you harbor bigoted thoughts which you share only with your fellow ""Christians"", then you will love this book.As for those of us who are either inspired by the openly loving example of Jesus or who don't care one way or the other, you will find the usual tedious thinking errors of that part of the religious-political spectrum that has given us so many pedophiles, bomb-dropping baby-murderers, and a certain cretinous President.Buyer beware. Zero stars."
4,God's Grace and Homosexual next door,The book was in excellent condition and arrived timely. This is a book for both my wife and I and it was very good reading and proved helpful better understanding and accepting alternative lifestyles.
4,A Good deal!,"I used a $10 Amazon gift certificate, so the game came to me free. I agree with the other reviews about this game, so I won't bother to expand on what they say; they've covered it all."
3,Thief DS,Is ok but the story is kind of boring and I didn't like the ending. They should of kept it for the pc only like Thief 1&2.
4,Original,"This is a young british band who I once saw supporting the Bluetones in Southampton, UK. The concert was sound, although I could not get over how much better Mover were than the Bluetones at a first listen. Don't get me wrong the Bluetones are an incredible band mixing influences of pop, rock and indie, but Mover seemed to be on a somewhat different level. I later borrowed the Mover album from a friend and found it very pleasing to the ear. This is a must by (along the the Bluetones' ""Return to the Last Chance Saloon"") and I would recommend anyone out there in the mists of cyberspace to by this album as soon as possible."
4,my favorite knife,"the only thing this knife needs is a lock but then again i think all folding knifes should lock. This is the knife that goes in my pocket all the time. I use it probably more more like a folding paring knife then any other use, but than again you'll probably find your wifes paring knife is used more than any other blade in the kitchen."
4,The Marriage Casket,"This is the third of a series by Deborah Morgan and is an interesting read, filled with information about antiques and the life of the ""hero"" and his family and extended family. We meet a new memer of the family a sister of Sheila, who is a photographer and a very extroverted character. The wife, Sheila has agoraphobia and is house bound....and keeps herself occupied with computer shopping, watching movies and gourmet cooking. In this book, Sheila has found a psychiatrist who will come to the home to help her learn coping skills dealing with her illness. Hopefully this will open doors where Sheila can go ""picking"" with Jeff, and become a more intricate part of the story. One of the reasons I read this series is that I am an agroaphobic and am very interested in how the author handles this illness."
4,Good Read,"Ms. Morgan's books were not something that appealed to me initiatlly, but now i am reading the 4th in the series! The characters Jeff talbot, his wife and butler make an intriguing central core for the books plots.The Marriage Casket is an excellent plot. One i haven't seen too often. I didn't figure this one out and as an avid mystery reader this idoesn't happen too often.THe bibiliography at the back of this novel, as with her others, is a fine start to those who want to learn more about antiques and such."
3,Chip's review,"The information presented is very thought-provoking and possibly life changing. As with all of the Seth books, the message is that you are MUCH more than you're personality. I found it annoying, however,that Robert Butts included his PERSONAL notes. They were HIGHLY unecessary and, since he was writing while "" Seth "" was dictating, he would actually write the WORD ""semicolon"" or ""period"" whenever ""Seth"" called for one. The editing is bad. Overall, though, this book IS powerful in that it gave me a larger view of creation and my place in it, which is why I read books of this nature."
4,Future ESPN announcer!,"So I found this game on Amazon for a great price. Since my son is destined to be the next Boomer, I thought it'd be fun and we'd all learn way more trivia. The game itself is easy to understand, good quality too. The questions -I'll be honest: I'm guessing A LOT. But it is fun and you WILL learn a lot of cool trivia. Better with 4+ people, even amounts."
1,Leaks,"I felt compelled to review these bags, because I feel they are the worst milk storage bags on the market. After 5 of the bags leaked breast milk all over, I tossed the rest. I only bought these because I was in a pinch and the lansinoh ones I usually buy were out of stock at the store I was in. I just can't imagine making a product so unreliable. I've not had a problem with the lansinoh or the medela brand bags. I do not recommend these."
1,LEAKS!!!!!!!!!!!,These are the worst bags ever. I started using the milk I had frozen in these bags and almost ALL of them have a tear somewhere. Every once counts specially when you are a working mom that want to give her baby breast milk. I will never buy them again.
4,Fun Songs Your Child Will Like,I bought this book and CD set for my 2 1/2 year-old when we moved to Germany. He loved it and listend to it over and over. Within two weeks he was singing the songs. The recording quality isn't the greatest but the songs are fun. I wish the CD were a little bit longer.
4,Great for kids,"I am a preschool teacher and the songs and lyrics come in handy. I wish they put more time in between each song to have the children repeat, other then that it's good."
2,I love Rozz!,"I recently received Shadow Play Live and the Christian Death Live DVDs. I had never seen Rozz live before so I was willing to pay almost any price. From a historical perspective, the Shadow Play DVD can be a valuable collection to your Rozz library, but for the discernable critic, it has little other value other than The Man is on it. As others before me have stated, everything about this DVD is sub-standard. Musicianship, picture clarity, sound quality, set design, and yes performance, suck. The Christian Death DVD is the total reverse. The musicianship and everything else, even Rozz's performance is 100% better. I viewed Shadow Play Live once and I have it up for resale and this is coming from someone who owns an extensive Rozz catalog. I'm listening to Live in Berlin right now! Anyway, may 2 cents."
3,Good theory but lacking applications,"It is not a friendly guide to Wavelets. However, chapters 1 one to six are excelent. Chapter 7, Multiresolution Analysis, the heart of the matter is hard to understand. So, you get the flavor of Wavelets but not learn to use it."
5,Ricky Time!,"These are definitely the years of Ricky Martin. Where else can he get? All he needs is to reach Hollywood and do his CD totally in English which will be out by March 1998. Vuelve is one of his best. It shows even more maturity than ""A medio vivir"" Although ""A medio vivir"" is an excellent work by him and Robby Rosa. Vuelve has all the good Caribbean rhythms that you need. In Vuelve, the mix is the greatest. From the slow jams up to La Bomba. Great Job Ricky, keep it up!!!!"
5,Oldie and Goodies,Nothing better than sitting outside on a warm summer day with a cool drink and the sound of DOo WOp and the background. Great music!
4,Works great except in low light.,"I am pretty happy with this camera. It works will outdoors. Indoor/low light is not that great. Then again, I was looking for the smallest camera with a 22x zoom. No regrets."
3,Nice piece of nostalgia,"The price of admission is justified by the incomparable Jim Gordon's drumming on ""Border Town."" Such exuberance."
3,OK,This is a GREAT cymbal if you're just looking for a cheap zildjian crash to add-on to your set. but if you're a High level drummer I would not reccomend this. it has a very annoying high-pitched sound and a very annoying ring to it at the end. But like I said it's only good for someone who is just looking to find a cheap cymbal
4,Track Listing...,Tracks...1) Livin' In The Sight of Water2) You Can Get There From Here3) You've Got To Hold On4) Radical Love5) I Need To Know You're There6) Love Will Find A Way7) Out of the Wilderness8) Tonight9) You've Got To Believe10) Long Lost Friend11) Lead The Way
4,Very good conditions,"The book arrived in really good conditions, almost unused (or it seemed so) and it arrived not only before the deadline but even before the first expected day, which I found quite useful, I didn't expected this to happen and more taking into account that it was shipped from USA to Spain"
3,Good Overview,"You probably won't learn all you need to about bass from just this book -but it's a pretty good overview of technique, music, gear, and performers.Definitely a decent addition to your bass books library."
2,Poor selections mar soundtrack,"This wonderful film deserves to be fully complemented by a soundtrack representative of its most meaningful moments. The 10-minute prologue is set against an instrumental version of ""Hey Jude"" that is absent from the soundtrack and apparently is unavailable for purchase. The omitted Simon and Stones pieces are standard stock and are all already part of my collection but other listeners will miss these highlights from the film. Dylan and Ravel are the direct hits here. Three strikes and your out."
4,Great easy listenening,I like this soundtrack because its very laid back. Enjoyable songs that help you relax.
3,"Good story, but ...","... I must say I was sorely disappointed by the editing of this book. Characters' names change in mid chapter, wrong words are used, wrong tenses are used. Granted, I am a copy editor and these types of mistakes usually stand out to me. Most books do contain some mistakes, but this was ridiculous. There were mistakes throughout the entirety of the novel. So, good book, bad editing.Laurel Causey"
3,Very generic,"This is the first book I have read by Jennifer Crusie and I'm not sure if I'd buy another one. I guess this one was one of her first books. The story is very thin and therefore you never really believe that these 2 have fallen for each other after 2 weeks. It had some good moments but just too bland for me. The love scenes weren't that great(too short for my taste), and the conclusion just came a bit too quick for me. Overall an OK read but nothing to get excited about."
1,Predictable and poorly written,"This is the first book I've read by Jennifer Crusie. I hate to give one star reviews, but I thought this book was poorly written and predictable, and I had to force myself to finish it. The characters were poorly developed as well."
4,Manhunting,"It was a great, quick read...My first book by Jennifer Cruise and definitely wont be the last."
2,"disappointed, but hopeful","After reading several others books by Jennifer Crusie, I was very disappointed with Manhunting. It was very juvenile, and predictable. I am still hopefully looking forward to her next novel being better."
5,Very enjoyable read,"Manhunting is the first book by Jennifer Crusie book I have read, however, it will not be the last. It was both amusing and touching. Is it a simple read? Yes. Who wants to read The Iliad all the time? The book is a lovely escape from reality. Or is it? Let's admit it ladies, don't we all make ""lists"" and ""plans"" in regard to finding the perfect mate? Like most cute, quick reads, if you don't take it too seriously and you will not be disappointed by this one."
2,Poor quality transfer of a poor quality movie,"Bought because I am a fan of 80's arcade games. This makes most 'B' movies look good. Quality of transfer was poor - some scenes very dim, sound volume goes up and down.Save your money and watch Porky's again."
3,murder at devil's glen,i enjoyed this when it aired on tv and had a vhs version and happpy to have a better version and enjoyed it again in better definition.
1,It will only serve ONE purpose....,"My 7 yr old found this machine on the bottom shelf of ACMoore with a clearance sign for $3. She was SO EXCITED because she is not allowed to use my good machine. The other reviewer is correct - directions are worthless, the stitches that the machine makes are awful and even as an experienced sewer, this machine is so different it's difficult to troubleshoot. BUT - as a homeschooler we can use it as a bad example and compare it to a good machine to illustrate the tension problems with bobbin thread and the whole basic function of a sewing machine. THEN we're gonna take this baby apart and not be concerned with breaking an expensive or even a machine of any value whatsoever!!!I can't believe I see these on Ebay for $20+ .... it's not even worth the box it is packaged in."
3,A funny insight into the boat charter business,"The Author is a sailor turned businessman turned sailor. This is a collection of short stories spanning his 9 years as the skipper of a beautiful wooden boat, the Ring Andersen, as he takes charterers to visit the Leeward and Windward Islands of the Caribbean. It is fun reading and it provides an 'in' into the apparent glamorous and adventurous life of men called 'Captain' that hold the fate of vessel and crew at their decisions and skills. I admit that I find some of the stories hard to believe (I.e. ""the US is in war with the USSR now"") they are simply too good to be truth, but they have high entertainment value. Other stories are hilarious and people may be wondering why you laugh so hard while reading or remembering them in public. Entertaining and informative."
5,Jazz it up,"Songs you recognise and songs you don't, you will love them all. Lounge around listening to the more laid back tracks or jazz yourself up with the funkier numbers. Whatever your mood there is something to listen to on this album especially the singing voice of CT Apple."
5,Great charger,"I have several dewalt tools, drills, circular saws, demo saws etc. They sit around most of the time until I finally need to use one. But, when I need one, I want it to work. If you're like me, then it takes an hour to charge a battery (most of mine lose power sitting in the case). Well that all changed when I got this 15 minute charger. If you have a portable tool (most of mine are 18 volt) with more than one battery, this charger is a must. The nice thing is about the time one battery runs down, another is ready to roll. If Dewalt wanted to really be a great tool company, they'd get rid of the hour chargers and only have the 15 minute ones. Well worth the money in fact I'm ordering a second one."
1,Broke in minutes,"I am glad I ordered 3 of these as the first one borke apart in minutes of unwrapping it. My daughter needed it for a play in which she played Tinker Bell in Peter Pan and she was so upset. If I had not bought three, I would have been the goat of the year....She has not stopped talking about it a week later and it really upset her when she blew through it for a few minutes and then it broke. She i snow hesitant to use the others before the production as she is afraid they will break too. Not a fun position to be in as a dad......"
4,Virtually Unknown Mascagni Opera,"A fine performance of an unjustly neglected opera by Mascagni. I dont know why people today are generally only interested in music they know! The duet between the two women competing for Nero is a high point in the score. 200 years ago people ONLY wanted to hear something new. Nowdays its increasingly rare to hear anything other than about 50 standard operatic works, few of which have been written within the last 100 years. The only reason for not giving this excellent performance five stars would be to hear one of our superb dramatic sopranos,like Karita Matilla, in the role of Atte. I would also recommend a comparison of this work with Boito's treatment of the same subject."
3,Old sensation in new bottle,"Rene Lecaille's new album somehow makes me think that i must have heard the rhythm somewhere in his old albums. However, it is still a very cheering and sensational listening experience with this new album. For me, it is worth the money i have to admit. As for music, i think, as a fan of his, it is still an outstanding album though lacks some new elements."
5,Love this flatware,"I have two sets and completely disagree with the review that said they tarnish, etc. Mine hold up really well and look beautiful. I intend to buy another so I have enough for twelve."
2,So Disappointed :(,"I bought my original set at Macys for $80 years ago and these to add to my stash. These have a different metal makeup (I think zero for the second number mean no nickel) and they have TONS of rust spots and little nicks that the Macys set does not. The price rocked, but I got what I paid for... Now these stay in the bottom drawer and only come out when I get desperate."
1,junk,i guess i got the bad one of the bunch........ the dial was pushed back into the housing....... dont know why the person who packaged this unit to send to me didnt notice......but then again why should he or she care...not his or her job................. bad bad amazon
3,Great game but be careful,Just a warning to the wise...I have a brand new PC laptop and I had enormous problems with this game...it is not supported on laptops and newer systems with new video and sound cards may not be compatable...it was a great game all the same but I feel like I missed half of it due to technical problems and this is not the first time I have had this problem with lucas arts games. Make sure you check the requirements carefully!
1,Ridiculously Shoddy for the price,"I have had this model for a year. It now leaks form every seal possible, from the threads linking the head and the body of the steel bottle, from the charger. Outrageous failure at this price."
3,Not my favorite.....,"""Frankly My Dear"" was a sweet book, but not much more. I will admit that it had it's moments, but some of the dialogue was sooo corny it made me cringe. This book was for the most part set in 1845, however, it had a distinctly modern feel to it..even the characters who werent from 1996 acted as if they were. I usually really enjoy Sandra Hill, but this book was just too cheesy for me..not terrible, but not great either. Mediocre at best."
1,This book was soooo bad,"This book was so bad that I stopped reading it after the first 100 pages. The premise was intriguing, but the characters were not. I bought it based on the glowing reviews. It was boring."
5,"GREAT!! FUNNY, WONDERFUL","I love Sandra Hill and this book is one of her best. I can not believe that some people did not love this story. The combination of the humor mixed with romance makes it one of the most enjoyable books I ever read. I did laugh out loud in parts, the characters are great and the story interesting. i highly recommend."
4,American Horror Story - Season 1,Another Christmas gift for my son. I look forward to watching it with him as I was unable to watch it on TV.
2,Regurgitated Claptrap,"This erratic hyperactive logic-free and downright pompous piece of trash wasted a lot more of my life than a 90-minute direct to DVD stinker.Sure, we were baited in with tantalizing teases of graphic violence, kinky violent sex and five shots of Dylan McDermott`s naked hiney in the first episode alone!But in the end, we got a lot of regurgitated claptrap composed mostly of scenes, music and entire plot lines directly stolen from other film sources.Instead of something truly original, we got something plagiarized and repackaged in a blindly flashy package.Although, now that I think of it...what's more ""American"" than that?"
1,Time to cancel my subscription to American Horror Story,"Wow. In the span of one episode (no. 12), American Horror Story went from suspenseful to suck. While watching that godawful mess of an episode, it wouldn't have surprised me if Michael Keaton had made a guest appearance as Beetle Juice.I haven't been this disappointed in a television series since Dexter went all Jesus in that series. (For a good drinking game, drink every time someone says ""Brother Sam"" in the newer Dexter episodes; you'll be passed out in under 20 minutes. Trust me.)I am soooo glad Amazon offers a ""cancel anytime"" policy. I'm taking full advantage of that one when it comes to the suckfest otherwise known as American Horror Story. Ugh. What a letdown."
5,AHS - The Complete First Season,Sent this to a very good friend who had never seen the series. He was hooked & watched the entire series in two days. He loved it & was really greatful for thinking about him on his birthday.
5,Scary Good,"There are currently two shows I'll even watch, and this is one of them. Super scary and shocking at times, it definitely keeps things interesting. It's refreshing to see a show that takes place outside of the proverbial 'box'."
4,Pretty Scary,I kept hearing about this show but couldn't find it anywhere on Netflix or Hulu. The instant feature is awesome! The show is completely creepy and I look forward to seeing the rest of the season.
4,Unique and Gritty Show,"This show is unique in the fact that it always has me thinking how did they get away with that. While I watched the first season and started the second, I have a hard time getting into the new Asylum season. I guess I will probably buy it to watch it that way. Loved the first season though and recommend it to horror fans."
3,It's great if you have Prime membership,It's interesting to watch... I can feel the writers trying a little too hard to add something else on every episode. They seems to be quite inspired by Kubrick. It's fun to watch since it's free with Prime membership.
1,A waste with nothing but recycled ideas,"It was recommended by many to check this out. So I did. What a waste of time..not scary, and not original.It felt like they put as much crass material into the series just to see how far they can push, and see what they can get away with. The opening scene had promise, but it then fell into cliche after cliche. ( people splitting up and running around in the dark) The ending was so anti climatic, not to mention it ripped the ending straight from Beetlejuice. if you have seen Rosemary's baby,sixth sense, beetlejuice, Legend of hell house, The haunting, then their is no need to watch this. Those movies did it better."
1,why ?,"how can you call this entertainment ? Why is it that while we are all locking ourselves away in more and more secure appartments, homes and offices; blaming the government and the powers that be for their inability to protect us; that we are fearful to even walk the streets due to the extent of horrific crimes that appear daily in the news reports, that at the same time we applaud garbage like this and call it entertainment ? 1984 the world has gone to hell ."
5,Deliciously Evil and Demented,"This series is NOT for an immature audience. It is dark and graphic and goes where many other shows will not. This show will creep you out mentally, physically, sexually, and you will love every minute of it. Its a masterpiece of horror."
4,Great Show,I'm not a fan of horror movies but this is a great show. You really need to pay attention but after the first 3-4 episodes its much easier to understand whats going on.
2,Not as good as Season 2.,"Aliens I can believe in, not ghosts. Too much gratuitous violence just for the sake of violence. Good movie for teenagers."
5,Scary!,"Last time I watched an episode, I slept with a hammer next to bed. Very entertaining. Lots of explicit content though - I'd feel uncomfortable watching it with anyone under 18. But, if you're grown and you want to go from scared to oddly aroused, this show is for you. Very creepy."
4,What happened?,"Tripped on this series and goot hooked, then aft about 6 episodes it started to get crummy. What happened? Then it disappeared altogether. No more seasons? What happened? Reminds me of another series that was great and faded out. All things must pass I guess. Maybe they made a bunch of money and quit."
3,Not a big horror fan,"It is well acted and good for people who enjoy this genre, not my favorite. I believe it received some emmy nominations."
5,Crazy Loved It!,this is an epic series! Loved the effects and crazy story line. So glad I purchased it and Season 2. Loved it!
4,Creepy but fun,It has an interestingly creepy storyline! I would definitely recommend this series to others. I can't wait to get through the whole season!
4,A Flawed but Fantastic Series,"I went into this with hesitation and I will continue to do so as the show's creator Ryan Murphy is notorious for creating shows that start out great out of the gate (Nip/Tuck and Glee for example) and after a few seasons descend into utter trash. While this season does have plot points (more like holes) that tend to point toward this show potentially veering off into that direction, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Yes it's full of unnecessary sex and violence but I love that stuff. While at the root of this show is essentially horror, there are some heart wrenching moments intertwined with the genre (somewhat spoiler alerts) like Violets story and Jessica Lange's background. And this brings us to Ms. Lange. You'll be hard pressed to find a more powerfully executed and nuanced performance from television. This character makes the viewer vacillate between pity, shock, disgust, sorrow and surprisingly even humor, a well deserved Golden Globe."
4,absolutly compelling but very dark,"this is riveting to watch, never a dull moment. the acting is excellent. however, I found it getting darker and darker, and this, plus the violence, got to be too much. there is nothing good to hold you above water it sinks to the lowest depths."
4,first season American Horror Story,"although I haven't watched all of the series as yet, I have enjoyed what I have watched and am looking forward to watching all of it."
4,Weird in a good way,Season 1 of American Horror story had a good vibe. Weird in a good way. Season 2 is definitely different but it's growing on me.
4,"Interesting, Twisted & Weird and Worth Seeing","Twisted Premise? CheckDark? Oh yeah.Weird relationships? CheckBizarre overall feeling? CheckScary? SomewhatHave to go back a few minutes every once in a while to see what the heck is happening? At least once per episode.Dr., doctor's wife, teen daughter & a slew of characters that are worth watching especially Jessica Lange, are you kidding me, she was amazing as the creepy, spying, totally 'off', in-your-bizniz nosy neighbor."
5,PHENOMENAL!,"I first I was hesitnat of watching this program, BUT I LOVE IT! Highly recommend. Just have to wait for the Dvd now... :P"
2,Useless,I decided to check it out because of all the hype. Boy was the hype ridiculous. The first episode was reasonable and it got me to watch the second one. By the third episode I've completely given up. The characters in the family are completely unlikable and the show just goes overboard. Random useless raunch.
1,Not a ghost of a chance of coming back,"I had high hopes for this series but it quickly degenerated into a ripoff of every horror movie ever made. Very little originality. What a way to end a season, finish killing off everybody that they spent a season getting you interested in."
5,This has been on my tivo for a year...,"and I just watched it. couldn't stop... two days later, all done with the 12 episodes and WOW what a great show. I got it on blu-ray yesterday and friends came over last night and everyone loved it! Creepy and Fun Great Acting!"
4,Spectacular,Eva Ayllon is sensational! Her performance was mesmerizing. She showcases what true Peruvian music is all about. This item is a must have.
5,The Right Book To Buy,"I very much agree with the other reviews on this site. This book hits the meat of using TCP/IP with Java. Some prerequisites for this book are the following topics. I recommend that you get a single book for each topic.* Basic Java Programming including I/O and Threads* The TCP/IP protocol suite and TCP/IP networking* Cryptography (recommended)* Java Security (recommended)You will need additional books if you want to hit topics such as these: Java's application-level networking API's, Servlets, JSP, RMI, CORBA. I also recommend this book because it lists references to 22 such supplemental books/documents."
2,Dewalt Battery,"Battery works fine. However, battery was advertised as Dewalt DW 9050 battery but it is actually a knockoff nondescript brand made in China. I feel it should have been advertised as such."
4,An amazingly accomplished piece of work,"Night Fisher is a graphic novel by R. Kikuo Johnson. It's his first work; at least, I haven't seen any mini-comics or short stories in any anthologies by him. Johnson's thick-lined black and white art is gorgeous, reminiscent of Paul Pope's work in its looseness. There are a couple of misspellings, something that's glaring in an art form where wordcount is low, but aside from that Night Fisher is an amazingly accomplished piece of work. My only other complaint: it ends abruptly. I want to know what happens next."
2,Should've Been Better,"I really wanted to like this book. It has a fantastic cover, is set in Hawaii, and the art's not too shabby. However, the plot fails to keep up and at the end, I asked myself, ""That's it?"" Very disappointing."
5,Conner Reeves Review,"Did not have the tune I wanted but it is very good music. What I wanted was ""First Time Ever I Saw Your Face""."
3,BEWARE-VERY SLIMY,The strawberry licorice wheels are pretty good. My biggest complaint is the slime. You don't think you ought to have to wash your hands after having licorice but with these you do. They have a pretty good flavor and tend to be addicting (what candy isn't). Just know what you are getting into because 5 lbs is a lot of candy.
4,Fastachi Cranberry Nut Mix,"This is a great mix and very fresh. I would have given it 5 star, the the 1 less star is because it is very pricey! I can finish one bag in a couple hours."
1,Book of Shadows? Not even a book!!!,"I had read such wonderful reviews, the index pages seemed pretty tempting, so I bought it. My god, what a waste of money! To begin with, it's as if somebody had printed a few pages in their home-printer and sent them to some xerox-place to get it binded, with a red back and a transparent cover. The contents are completely superficial, and the spells are ALL about money, a few about love, and that's it. Believe me, you can get all what's inside this book by surfing the web, cheaper and with a lot more literary content and deeper investiation."
4,Dewalt DW9048 Battery Pack,"(2) replacement 9.6 VDC battery packs were $20-40 more than the price of a comparable, new, drill/driver kit, which includes a 14.6 VDC drill/driver, (2) battery packs, battery charger and case. Think about it!"
4,Black and Decker Cordless Drill and Battery,"While now dated and surpassed by newer models, the Univolt drill kit was the first cordless tool to demonstrate that this drill and battery could be a serious tool.On a darkening afternoon, it was possible to screw down seven or eight 4x8 sheets of plywood to complete a roof deck, before the storm hit!The Univolt battery lasts for a mornings work and generally recharges during lunch for the afternoon session.While the product line has changed with the upgrade to the Yellow Dewalt line, the consumer level Black and Decker units, especially the new Firestorm models should be given serious attention by the homeowner, or professional needing a less expensive but very servicable tool."
3,"The first CD is bland, but the second disc picks up the pace","As far as instrumental trance goes, Perfecto Presents Another World is a decent choice. Most of the first disc is slower, and contains more of the American break beat type sound. The second disc caught my attention however with it's fast pace and awesome remix of Sarah McLachlan's Silence. Some of my other favorites include Eugina 2000 and Song To The Siren. The only songs on this compilation that truly seem out of place are the songs from the Blade Runner soundtrack. I suppose they were added to provide a soft interlude between the club style tracks, but I still feel as though they are out of place here. So if you are looking for a CD to play at a party or some sort of gathering, Another World will supply you with enough varied style to satisfy everyone. If you are looking for a compilation with more consistency in the way of electronic trance music, I recommend trying Astral Projection's In The Mix instead."
1,depressingly bad,"I'm writing this review in the hopes of saving even one other person from making the same mistake that I did.I see that others have written better reviews than I could, so I'll just list a couple of my chief complaints: parts are too repetitive and monotonous (even for a club); some of the vocals are just plain bad; out-of-place, non-musical sounds, in some songs; and finally, the annoying samples of annoying people plugging Oakenfold.In my opion, Tranceport was a masterpiece (I only find myself skipping a couple tracks). This, the only other Oakenfold CD I'll ever own, is almost bad enough (except for one or two tracks) that I'd consider throwing it in the trash.Normally, I would probably give this 2 stars. I can't possibly fathom how it got so many favorable reviews. Since it fell so drastically short of my expectations, it gets only one."
3,tired and confusing,"Maybe this album takes a few listens, but I certainly don't want to hear the stupid soundbites Oakey has dropped into the mix ever again: what was he thinking? People blathering on about ""Perfecto Radio"" and ""are you going to the club? Oakenfold's playing!"" is not only irritating but hopelessly dated and unimaginative. Oakenfold's attempted to vary the trance formula by including the 'mystical' (read: pretentious) sounds of Dead Can Dance and early synth/techno work of Vangelis, but his musical palette needs further development if he's to convince anyone of his intentions. Overrated."
3,Not as Good as Tranceport,"2 CD set. First disc is, unfortunately, incredibly repetitive, monotonous, metronomic, and BORING. I can't believe that this is even Oakenfold. This is the kind of Trance mixing that creates such criticism of it being just repetitive, drum-machine, non-music. The only stand out tracks are #1 & 10. I am a huge fan of Dead Can Dance, and I was looking forward to what Oakenfold was going to do with their great songs. It turns out nothing. The tracks are left basically untouched. Very disappointing.Second disc is COMPLETELY different. Beautifully mixed selections that have a wonderful flow. THIS is Oakenfold! Similar in beauty to Tranceport. Wonderful work.I will never listen to the first disc again. (They must have known that nobody would buy the first disc by itself so they had to package it with another.)BUY THIS CD SET FOR THE SECOND DISC!"
5,"Alright, there are some corny parts, but selection is great","Yes, I admit that there are corny parts in this mix that subtract from its value, such as ""Are you going to go see Oakenfold?"" and such, but besides that, the mixing is great.Oakenfold's track selection is amazing, from Jan Johnston's Flesh to Vangelis' Rachel's song. The mix flows from front to back and the track selection is great. Although this is much different from his first mixes such as Fluro and his Resident at Cream, this is Oakenfold taking a different path to his normal hard-trance mixes; he's trying something new.Each additional play of this CD only makes me like it even more. If you want a Tranceport-type mix, this is not the CD for you, but if you're looking for a mix that flows through various styles of electronic music, get it."
5,Another world of Oakenfold,"As much as I like Paul Oakenfolds previous CD's I like the new style he uses on Another world. Being a die hard Van Dyk fan I like the stylings on this disc which are close to the stylings of Van Dyk. The mixes are strong the drops are incredible and the vocals take you to.... well another world. BUY THIS CD! There is no other way to say it. I had this disc on my computer for two months before it came to the states, but my admiration and respect for this incredible work for trance music drove me to buy the disc."
4,"Daniel Steele's novel ""Secrets""","Entertaining, light read, typical of the author's work. Characters lack depth, but the story is full of life's contradictions and family challenges."
3,Tried to give DS another shot,"I stopped reading Danielle Steele long ago because I felt like I was reading the same book over & over. This was on the bottom of my ""to read"" pile & I decided to read it. It was the same ole, same ole, story line that DS is famous for. I like more character development. Also, I don't really care for seeing into the minds of shallow, selfish and petty people. Why anyone would fall in love with Bill in this book is beyond me. Gabby does even though he treats her horribly then has a total turn-around & lo & behold they are in love. How a stay-at-home mom can all of the sudden decide to totally leave her kids with a psycho dad was also weird to me. Several of the other ""life situations"" for the other characters had a false ring to them."
4,Pretty good cd,"I think this cd was recorded very well. It has original sounding music. The downside for me is the vocals that go with the music. I think if there was more variety within the vocals one could distinguish between songs better, especially for a person who might not listen to this type music. Different vocals would really set this band off."
2,Slow to boil water,This kettle has a groove on the bottom. I'm not sure because of this but takes lots longer than my old one to boil water on my flat top stove. It's made well but I wouldn't buy it again.
2,Good insoles for some purposes,"I ordered these insoles because I am a cyclist and have suffered a lot from ""hot foot"". It is something that can happen on long rides that involve a lot of climbing and happens when the metatarsal bones become compressed. The idea is that the pad will spread the matatarsals out and prevent the painful numbing and burning. I think that because these are a type of soft plastic, they don't work well for athletics. They tend to move in my bike shoes and bunch up.I'm still looking for the right solution to hot foot!!"
2,After 1-1/2 years broke twice,After using the DeWalt for 1-1/2 years around the house the chuck broke. Replace that but now the clutch has gone out on me. I used it for drilling and screw driving. I am going to another drill with a longer warranty that is better built.
1,Overcharged,"I was charged $8.38 for one bar of soap. I mistakenly thought I was getting a pack of 3 for that price like I did a month ago from another company for around the same price. Not only that, the box was open! I wiould have returned it if it werent for the plastic wrap around the bar. I wont buy from this merchant again. It's funny how now the bar is ""on sale"" for a little over $3.00."
2,not what I expected....,"I thought that this would be the next Slum village album, but it isn't. This album only has one or two Slum Village songs on it, and the rest are unknown rappers. The album is in mixtape fasion, with a DJ yelling at the beginning of every song. If you're looking for the new Slum Village album, it comes out July 30 and it's titled Trinity (it has their new joint Tainted on there as well)"
5,Phenomenal Resource Worth Much More Than Its Price,"This is simply a very well-thought-out, phenomenal resource for any business owner. I have yet to find any better book about writing sales copy except for Brian Keith Voiles' Advertising Magic. The steps Kennedy explains are simple and doable, and he has a gift for telling the nuts n' bolts of writing excellent sales letters. Get it"
4,Sales Letter,I have only started the book but so far it has been a hugh asset to my business.. I have learned new ways to teach my sales staff to be most productive...
5,Write copy? You need this book!,"Why do you need this book? Most everything I read was heard before, but re-enforced. Frankly I'm going to use this book to write sales letters for myself to sell my services. Benefits and features is covered again and should be a reminder to copywriters that the theory is what sells products. You have to reach out to the consumer with what interests them, not what the advertiser has to sell."
5,"Another powerful, practical book from Dan","Have you ever spent hours writing the perfect sales letter, only to send it out and get little or no response? This information-packed book is sure to show you where you went wrong. And it takes you through all the basic steps and concepts that go into writing amazingly effective sales letters. Of course, there's no substitute for practice, but this book will get you off to a solid start.Known as the ""No B.S."" guy, Dan Kennedy is a crack copywriter and consultant who regularly helps clients make millions of dollars. From my personal experience (and I have a shelf full of Dan Kennedy's stuff), all his books are worth their weight in gold. But be warned, he has a straight-up, slightly sarcastic style of communication that you either love or hate. Personally, I love it. And I confidently recommend anything and everything Dan Kennedy writes or sells."
2,Weather station,The weather station was easy to install. The wind speed has never worked. I did not get around to sending the weather station back so i just use it as is.
2,Lacks reliability,"I have had my weather station for a little over a month and have generally been disappointed. It is confusing to set up and the reset buttons in some of the units are accessed only by unscrewing plates that cover the button. Already the rain gauge has quit working, the UV monitor apparently does not come with the unit or it never worked in the beginning. The base unit is hard to operate. Instructions are sparse.In its favor, it was delivered in good shape and in a timely manner. The range on the wireless unit has been good."
5,Great Weather Station for the Price,"I purchased my WMR100 with an additional tempreature sensor over a year ago and it has proven to be an excellent unit. The batteries on the rain gauge lasted one year and the other sensors are still going. The only issue I have had is that the rain gauge has to have direct sight to the base. It will not connect if there are any obstructions, walls etc. in the way. Otherwise everything is perfect and very accurate.Mike Owens"
1,wmr100na,"THIS IS TOTALLY WORTHLESS. I PURCHASED ONE LAST YEAR AND IT FAILED WITHIN 3 MONTHS. THE COMPANY SENT ME ANOTHER AND BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL AND THE NEW SYSTEM I WAS NOT ABLE TO GET A FULL OPERATING UNIT. THE OUTSIDE TEMP SENSOR DOES NOT WORK, THE WIND GAGE DOES NOT WORK, AND I DO NOT LIKE THE PROGRAM THAT COMES WITH IT. I TRIED TO FIND ANOTHER LOGGING PROGRAM, BUT NONE WORKED WITH IT AT THE TIME."
3,Oh boy,"I agree with A. Vega. Mostly, but I am more forgiving. I believe this is either halfway through or near the end of the tour. Not sure. Ozzy looks tired as the rest of the band. Yes he does read his own lyrics. He has had this problem for a long while. This dvd just shows it by zooming in. What is even more amazing is that he has come out with a new album since then and is making another that coming out very soon. So Zakk says in Guitar World Magazine. So in closing I say the band is tired/hang-over."
5,Great little vacuum,"I chose to go with a shop vac for cleaning my house because I have continuously broken upright vacuums due to sucking crayons, pennies, beads, you name it ( I have three children, two dogs and I run a home daycare) up into them so when my Mother suggested I buy a shop vac I did. It was a great decision. This little vacuum is powerful and really gets the job done at my high traffic house. The wheel assembly for the bottom was easy to install and stays well in place with the four screws that are provided, which is what I was really worried about based on others reviews. There are lots of attachments for cleaning and it is small and light weight. I am very pleased with it."
4,The Maintenance Man,"What a refreshing read for me! After being soooo disappointed by the first novel of another African American male, I breezed through this novel, and I don't consider myself an actual reader. Mr. Baisden's novel is the pick of the month for my bookclub and everyone is very excited to discuss the juice, dirt, and the so-very-accurate views on relationships. Keep up the good work. I have lots of catching up to do with your other titles. I look forward to each and every one of them. By the way, I most enjoyed the male-male relationship storylines. I will recommend this to males and females alike. Thanks."
3,50/50,"I read this book years ago, so I do not remember specific details. I gave this book 3 stars b/c it was a fascinating read. Did I enjoy it? A little, but not really. This is a book that everyone was talking about at the time, so that was my main reason for indulging. It was pretty formulaic to me. No different from any other such book."
3,Not what I expected,"This book was waaaay better than I expected, it held emotion. The minor characters had their own stories woven into it, giving examples of dating and relationships. This book had me cracking up, and then you felt sorry for Malcolm. My question is, did Ariel find love in her friend Chris? and Why the hell Simon forgive Cynthia?, [she] didn't deserve him."
2,What is the hype about?,I read lots of fiction and some fact and this was really not good to me at all. The only likeable character that was not really devloped was Ariel. The novel read like a black Harold Robbins novel of the 70's. The authors arrogant shows so much in his writing. I gave it two stars because I feel anyone who attempts to write should get a star and the character Ariel is why the other novel. I don't like judging anything but perhaps this may be of help to the author who may read this for the next book.
5,It don't get no better!,Well it looks like Micheal have done it again. This book was excellent from beginning to end. Micheal know how to write for the minds of men and women. I had the honor of meeting Micheal at a seminar in Raleigh NC. The seminar was best I've been to in a long time. In conclusion I want to say this book was worth the wait. Keep up the good work Micheal!
1,The second time around isn't better,"I just finished this book for the second time, and I was not impressed. The ending was weak. Nothing like Gods Gift to Women."
5,Ooooh baby....:),"This book is off the wall and funny, and charming, and even sexy. I found myself finishing this book in a day just to read what would happen next. I was ready...I had my comforter on me, laying on the bed, and even at work while I was watching the kids...I read. The literary language of this book is audacious and bold, and that sets it apart from most novels. Although when I read the passion and intelect that was poised in this novel I know that there are still some good men out there.Malcolm Tremell a gigalo, a player, and a fine brotha has been a gigalo for 12 years and when faced with the choice to hang up his boots and fall in love or enjoy the bebefits of beautiful women, beautiful sex, and lots of money. I enjoyed this book very much, and I think that it is a true and honest picture into a mans mind...Love does conquer all I guess. :)"
5,Talk about a good book!!!,"I had a hard time putting this one down!!! The beginning grabbed me right from the start and I was very glad that the main focus was not just on the character of Malcolm, also of those close friends and individuals who affected his life along the way. I thought the book was very well written and shows how young peoples beginning can be mold from what they see of those who raised them and Malcolm was one of those young people and went out and did what he saw his father do but took a step further and made a name for himself in the world of high price entertainment! Michael Baisden had a way of making me feel like I was seeing all of what I was reading right there in front of me....and once again I have to say I'm glad I brought the book and will pass it on to others to read!"
4,Good Read!,"I really enjoyed this book. I was skeptical at first because of some of the reviews I had read here, however I decided to go ahead and take a chance. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was the ending, it was too abrupt. I would have liked to known more about what happened to the characters. Oh well, maybe a sequel! I will be checking out ""Men Cry in the Dark"" next. Much success and blessings to Michael Baisden. Peace!"
2,Potential Wasted,"What was most lacking in this latest book by Mr. Baisden was simply a good story to tell...or, at least, enough of a story to tell. Skimming the surface of what could of been really meaty, Malcolm's dreams of becoming a jazz musician were barely touched upon and explored and Simon and Cynthia's issues were resolved too easily. This causes the characters over all to fall into stereotypes. The playa who wants to reform, the good black man who can't see the forest for the trees, and the Dog who of course suffers predictably in the end. The story of a high class Black Male Gigolo was a good idea not given enough weight."
2,It's taking me too long to read,"I love this author and his initiative, but The Maintenance Man has taken me way too long to read and I probably won't ever finish it. I purchased it well over three months ago and I'm only halfway through it. It's VERY slow paced. This automatically makes me give a book a lower rating because I'm a reader who can usually finish a book that's well worth reading in about two to three days tops. If the book is a real page turner, I'll finish it in hours, losing sleep if I have to. If you're in to the subject matter, I suggest trying your luck at reading this. If you're just curious about Mr. Baisden's work, I suggest picking up the best selling Men Cry In the Dark."
5,THIS BOOK WAS SO GOOD!!!,"I love books that basically keep me interested from beginning to end. Books that make you almost forget eating! That's a good book, ""Maintenance Man"" is the book that does just that.From beginning to end Michael Baisden creates characters that are just like people we know. You see there flaws and laugh at their situations. You can see the whole book unfold just like a movie right in front of you.I guarantee that you will enjoy this book."
4,Good Resourse for Parents,"I got this book on a whim, and found it quite useful...especially for selecting the best natural food products for our new baby!! Would recommend for all parents who are interested in making sure that their kids eat healthy food. The authors appear to have done an extensive amount of research, which seems to be presented in an unbiased fashion. There are also coupons in the back of the book for some of the products they recommend. Wish more products were covered....i guess i'll have to wait for the next volumes to be published....I've given them a 4 rating instead of a 5 star rating because they did not include a summary of all their product recommendations in the front or back of the book (which would have been quite useful to bring on grocery shopping trips)..."
3,Only buy if you're a huge PC adventure game fan,"I guess PC adventure games just aren't my thing. I tried to like Grim Fandango, I really did. After all the praise it got I assumed it would be awesome. But instead I found it rather boring and filled with bugs. Tedious puzzles, terrible graphics, and countless lock-ups forced me to resort to speeding through the game using a walkthrough just so I could see how the story ended. But hey, if it weren't for the unique and interesting story and characters I wouldn't have bothered beating it at all. And for that I give it 3 stars."
2,"Not as Fun, going as you think","This game was recommended for me after my satisfaction with ""The Curse of Monkey Island."" As like the sequal, ""Escape From Monkey Island,"" it included a lot of ""Keyboard Punching"" with arrows and letters. My kids, ages 6 and 12, did not find this convient to play, even with a joystick, only because it was not as easy as others... not even for me.... Mom."
5,Nothing else compares,"I waited too long to get this game. Had I known how perfect it is, I could have saved myself a lot of frustration with other, lesser, games. Lucasarts does not fail-their games excel, and this is the best of the bunch. You can even get the soundtrack from the game on CD! I'm listening to it as I write this, actually....PS-Glottis is GREAT!"
4,2nd time was a charm,"The first fountain I received was very loud - the pump kept cycling through and was very noisy. I swapped it out with another fountain from Amazon and this one has the soft gurgling fountain noise with none of the loud pump noise. Now I am very happy with this purchase and product. If you get one that is making too much noise, return it and hope that the 2nd one works properly."
5,Big Dog Water Fountain,"We bought the Drinkwell Platinum loved it, but when we got the lab we had to move up in the size. Gator was gulping it down and the Platinum couldn't keep up. Whether you have a large dog or multiple dogs this is the fountain for you. The large resevoir is great for large dogs or a household with multiple pets. Love this item"
4,Dog LOVES it! But takes some time to clean....,"Our large dog has used this waterdish for about 6 months. He absolutely loves it. The only downside, and the reason I can't give it the full 5 stars, is for clean-up. At least every 2 weeks it needs to be taken apart and cleaned (just as you would any water or food dish). The base is unfortunately too large for a standard-sized dishwasher. So be prepared to hand-clean the whole thing, and also it can be a little clunky to pick up and move to the sink. Just what I've found. But that drawback isn't enough for us not to recommend it... our dog loves it!"
3,It's too loud,"For as much noise as this little thing makes, it should have an air tube that sits on the bottom that will blow fallen debris (that has sunk to the bottom of the bowl) into the suction area to be filtered out of the water.That little pump makes as much noise as my 50 gallon fish tank filter system. We even put it on a rubber mat and it still makes a lot of racket. We'll have to see if the cats ignore the noise and use the system or if we'll be sending it back."
3,Time Saver,Great product if you have multiple dogs. Making sure the filter is changed and unit cleaned is a must.Cleaning the unit thoroughly is difficult at best even with the purchase of the cleaning kit which in my opiion is pretty much a waste of money. The sharp edges and deep cavities make cleaning difficult as the corners of the inside of the unit collect dirt films which are hard to get to. They need to engineer the inside without the edges and use curved/rounded designs.Good luck!
3,works well,"As much as my dogs enjoy drinking out of the hose, I thought they would really like this. They seem to like it fine, but not as excited about it as I was. It's easy to take apart and clean, but a bit big to get in the sink. It really needs to be cleaned at least once a week. It hold a lot of water and is really easy to add water to. It has a nice soothing sound, but at first I kept thinking water was running somewhere."
1,Poor design,"This didn't work at all for me. The shape seems very strange, was too short in front, and had odd seams around the neck that didn't seem to do anything, but looked odd. The supposed features like the loop to hold it down are silly. I wear a size 18, and I felt this was just too small to be useful. The light weight of the fabric was just what I was looking for, but the functionality and size just aren't there."
5,mmmmmgood,"this is the only chew my dog will eat..they are clean and do not leave brown ""baste"" stains on carpet..keeps my pup's breath fresh."
5,Awesome Product,This item is fantastic......we use it to wipe down our ceiling to floor 6' by 11' by 10' all tile shower with ease. Its slip proof handle makes it real easy to use. Because we are using it on tiles the life of the product is not lifetime but that is NOT a reason not to buy this product. IT IS WONDERFUL and quite a find. Once you try it you will be hooked on it. Nothing is fun about wiping down your shower..but this make is so much easier and so much quicker! You'll fall in love for sure.
4,"like everything about it except the price, but cats love them.","like everything about it except the price, kind of expensive, but the cats love them. they each have their favorites."
3,Kind of the bump in the road...,"The second season started with a bang but here, due to the Look at the Princess episodes, it slows down just a tad. We get into a lot of chatacter development and interaction while learning a little more about the Peacekeepers and their interaction with other planets and nations. In other words, lots of talking and little action."
2,burnt motor,"Bought about 9 mo. back. Used for a couple of days for a small drywall job. Stored the rest of thje time. Pulled out for use last week. I used it for about four days. The machine had a total of about 10 hrs. total use time. The motor suddenly burnt out. I took it apart to diagnose the cause and found nothing obvious. I took it to a pro for a diagnosis and was told what I already knew. Burnt out motor, no cause found. I will go back to my old Craftsman which is over 8 years old."
2,Value Fulfillment!!!,Although there are many Seth books I would sincerely recommend - Im afraid to say Vol.1 at least isnt one of them. With over half the of the first vol taken up with Rob's notes and a preface - I was constantly fighting with the urge to just put it down and forget it. Perseverance paid off when it came to Vol2 with many meaningful insights. If I'd purchased this book in the more conventional way (from a store) it wouldnt have made the check-out. I'm torn with being judgmental about Seth books because we all benefit in different ways and maybe the way the two vols were constructed will suit some people and not others. We owe it to the generations to come to maintain the availability of the Seth material - but I really think this wont be among the top sellers.
3,4 cup coffee maker,This item is good for travel and for those who make small amount of coffee to drink and not for a large house hold or one who drinks too much coffee.It takes just two minutes to make the coffee with a filter and one needs a large amount of coffee powder for a single cup!
5,Couldn't find in stores anywhere-,"Nice that you can still find these bags on line. Arrived on time and good price.Haven't used yet, but looks like the right one to fit in this vacuum purchased a couple of years ago."
4,Get your child ready for school,"I've read a lot of 'first day of school' type books recently, getting my daughter prepared for preschool. I'd rate this as one of the better books we read, and if your child likes Yoko and the other kids in Wells' Hilltop School books, I strongly recommend it. What I like about the book is that it gently repeats the reassuring idea, that parents ""will come back. They always do."" Once Yoko accepts that, she's ready to be left at school by herself."
4,Fun Game,"My son is six years old and is liking this game for short periods of time. It will go over a door or on a door knob. For a six year old, the door is a bit high, the door knob is a bit low. However, he makes due, and plays it every few days for 10 minutes or so. I didn't really expect more than that so we are happy with it. He is not real into the educational part of it - counting by 5's, 10's, 2's, or in Spanish, but this added componant is great. It ""sneaks"" in learning."
4,"Social history, not very interesting","One might have assumed Roman social history in the time of Hadrian was interesting. According to other accounts and sources it was, but this book doesnt make it interesting. In the interest of writing what is basically a social history of many topics this book ignores the subject, Hadrian and empire. There is little discussion of military campaigns or politics, there is too much concentration on 'Hadrain Britain' and the wall built there. Hadrian was involved in so much more and so was empire, especially in the Middle East, and yet we are not treated to any of this. This book fails as social history and at biography and at everything else. For someone truly interesting in everyday life in Rome in the period it makes interesting reading, otherwise not.Seth J. Frantzman"
3,Not to bad,This book is able to turn people on to Shakespeare. The author has a creative way of telling you about Shakespeare without telling a timeline. I feel this is a good book for people who like and dislike Shakespear alike. In the end Barroll makes his point and leaves the reader convinced of his opinion.
1,Poorly handled by Amazon,"This one was ""lost in shipping"" by Amazon. They never bothered to tell me so or their policy not to re-ship the order."
1,Pitiful,This item was pitiful. A piece of crap. The connection with the headset must of been faulty. The sound cut in and out. And it used up batteries at a ridiculous rate. I could never figure out what was going to make it use batteries so fast. Buttons were inset too low and the touch attributes were not so friendly. I'm trashing this piece of junk.
1,Coby CXCD109BLK Personal CD player,Not so pleased with this purchase... it plays but uses far to many batteries. Cannot move around and listen to my CD's.. It has to remain perfectly flat or it either stops or garggles the words. I bought it to listen to books on tape will working out.. I do not recommend this item.
1,Only took two weeks to fall apart...,"I would not recommend this product to anyone. My sonreceived this cd player for his 10th birthday as areplacement for an old one. Within two weeks the head-phones quit working. The unit skips with the slightestmovement, making it no fun and unusable to my son. Ifyou can believe it, the old cd player is actually moreusuable than this almost brand new Coby cd player. : ("
1,Tainted with lead!!!!!!!,"Not only is this product a piece of crap, it specifically gives a warning to wash your hands after using b/c the cords are full of lead!! Who is regulating this stuff?!!"
3,affordable listening,I am very happy with my little red CD player although if you intend to use this product to take your morning jog I wouldn't recommend it because it has no anit-skip but it is very good for just relaxing and listening to your favorite CD.
2,Non-skip feature does not work.,"I purchased this item because it has a ""non-skip"" feature. I have found that basically, this feature does not exist on this item. Disappointed."
2,Small CD player,"This item is lightweight and compact, but it uses batteries like there is no tomorrow. It cannot be plugged into an outlet so it is actually quite an expensive item."
3,I liked my previous CD player better,"It's kind of flimsy, the screen has tiny letters, but I guess it's okay. I haven't tried the headphones yet, they are kind of big for my taste."
1,Works for under 5 minutes at a time,"It skips at every little movement, but that is expected with a cheap player like this.However, even sitting on a table (no bumps to cause skipping) it would freeze after two to three minutes of usage, and I would have to pop it open, close it and then try to get back to the spot I left off. Two minutes of listening later, same problem would happen again. I gave it the benefit of a doubt and tried a few different clean CDs, same problem. Hopefully someone at salvation army won't mind."
2,Not descriptive enough,For the money not too bad. Has to be kept still or the disc skips. Most annoying is that it doesn't have an ac adaptor option which was not revealed to me until I opened it.
1,Very poor product,I have bought several Coby products.They are very poorly made and don't work well. I would not reccomend buying this or their tape recorders either.
2,No choices,"I thought this item came with or you had a choice of color. It did not. It is silver with black trim. It is also not very portible, you have to play it while its sitting on a flat, level surface."
2,Top and bottom of picture are cut off,"This review is for the Xenon 2012 release:This looks like a full screen release with the top and bottom cut off. No only are we losing the sides, but the top and bottom are cut off as well. I don't know if this was done to fool viewers into believing this to be widescreen, but it's noticeable right from the beginning as a portion of the title credit runs off the bottom of the screen. When the animation begins, the characters feet are cut off. I would have preferred this to be released a full screen instead of having additional portions of the picture cut away. I'm happy that the film was finally released, but I hope this gets re-released in its original aspect ratio in the near future. Coonskin is a great movie, the price is decent, and the picture quality here is not bad, but the cutting off of the top and bottom takes away from fully enjoying the animation."
4,Whoops...,"I wrote the review of the sixth DvD and insinuated that that was the last one, than this pops up...If you're still interested in what I wrote -doubtful- in that one, give the sixth one a look see and my feelings in that commentary reflects on the FINAL DvD here."
2,Barely watchable.,"This has always been a great series. Beautifully drawn with shades of grey. But the series you start watching is not what you end with. You are drawn in with some amusement as a demon hunting girl and her good-demon boyfriend exorcise ghosts,demons,etc. It's lighthearted with hints at the past and a missing brother. It's so good, you don't notice that the last DVDs are intense and humorless. The object is to defeat the demons and save Rossette's little brother, right? Well, no. This is a sad, mysterious tearjerker I was NOT expecting. Isn't there a rule that says most of the main characters have to live??I suggest stopping the series after three DVDs before you are too involved in the story. I was disappointed. I give the first DVD 5 stars however."
2,Adaquate - just!,"What I find missing from all books on reloading shot shells is the lack of information on the many (Estate, RIO, Winchester and Remington promo shells, etc.) that we find on the shelves of the big box store and gun shops. There are many hulls that we have no clue of who makes them. Books like this one give the same data that all primer, wad, and powder makers give for Remington STS or Winchester AA. Unless we spend $12 a box for the premium shells, we are stuck with a bunch of hulls that has no reloading data. i find this rather superficial, and writer should address this."
3,Bags are a little beat fragile,"You cannot remove them and put them back once they're installed; the ""collar"" might tear and create a leak in the bucket of the vac. Otherwise, product is OK."
5,Just what I was looking for,These were hard to find for my Hang-On Shop-Vac. Very easy to install. Helps collect dirt and small debris like a charm without making a mess of your Shop-Vac.
4,good all around workout,Good workout with options for a shorter workout on those days where you don't think that you have time.
4,Good workout!,"I really like Jackie Warner's ""Power Circuit Training."" I've been doing it 3 times a week for about a month. The exercises are a challenge, but not so difficult to to be discouraging. The strength routines are divided into 15 minutes each of upper body, lower body, and abs. Or you can opt for the 40 minute workout. Jackie's pace is fast, fun, and energizing.I am a moderate level, middle-aged exerciser. This probably wouldn't be the video you'd want if you are advanced and want something ""killer,"" but for me it's great and I feel I'm definitely getting stronger and more fit."
5,Efficiency and effectiveness defined!,"If you're looking for a workout that will challenge and strengthen you in a fast paced way, this is it! This is my first dvd purchase of Jackie Warner's workouts and I am so happy I bought it. No muscle group is left behind. Did the 40 minute circuit training workout with hubby this morning and we're both in agreement that we'll be feeling this workout's effect for a few days. Excellent program!"
4,Pleasantly sore,"I love this workout. It is thorough and moves fairly fast. It gives my abs a great workout - something that my Jillian Michaels' Shred It With Weights and Ripped in 30 Days don't do (Jillian Michaels' DVDs work for me too, improved my cardio fitness, strength, and improved my shape). So far, only this DVD and Cardio Fusion Leaned and Toned have left me pleasantly sore. None of the other workout DVDs I did left gave me this very pleasant after-effect. The stretch session is quite short, I find it insufficient. So I stretch myself out for longer after the workout.What I love most about this workout is the variety of exercises. Each circuit is 4 mins and has three exercises. Each is done for a minute, then do all three in the fourth minute. There are several circuits so I don't get bored. I really like this as weight training is not my favourite and long or repetitive exercises bore me."
5,Excellent workout! You must try this!,"Purchased this DVD thinking I was in pretty good shape from doing my other workout DVD's (Jillian Michaels) and was surprised on how much I hurt the next day. This workout is quick paced and easy to follow, but you can definitely feel the burn. For the price of this DVD you must try it, it's worth triple the price and then some. Jackie sticks to the workout without any nonsense and I love that, excellent workout DVD."
2,Not Impressed,"Short and Sweet: This DVD did not elevate my heart rate at all. The movements were slow and after the 40min workout I felt like I needed a workout, in fact, I did another workout. I was sore after this DVD, which means 1: the warm up did not have enough cardio to get the muscles warm/flexible; and 2: the cool down did not stretch the muscles adequately. I really like the Xtreme Time Saver DVD that Jackie has. I'd pass on this DVD for Bob or Jillian- the workout was just lacking."
5,WOW! BEST EVER!,"I am getting married in a few months and want to look good in my pictures. I'm a pretty active person and have played sports my whole life, I also go to the gym 4-6 times a week. I loved Jackie Warner in her reality show ""Workout"" and with a body like that, she obviously knows what she's doing. I happened to have her circuit training workout OnDemand with my cable company for free so I gave it a try and I'm hooked! The very first workout i woke up so sore I could barely walk, that's amazing! I typically will do 45 minutes of interval cardio and then 30-40 minutes of resistance weights at the gym and this workout with Jackie gave me a better burn than my gym workout. She keeps me motivated the entire time and it goes by so quickly. It's the same exact workout as the one on the DVD so I can't wait to buy it. Try this, keep it up and you will see results in no time!"
3,wish there were some cardio thrown in,I thought when I saw circuit training mentioned that there would be bouts of cardio thrown in. This is strickly weight circuits that do not seem very challenging. Try to use heavy weight to create some challenge for yourself.
5,wow!,"Personal training with jackie dvd is awesome. I love it. At first I thought it would't be as good as her ""One-on-One"" workout dvd (which I also love), but you can really feel the difference after just one workout. She really makes form a priority and modifies each workout for beginners to advanced. I like how it doesn't feel like a workout until you're done because it goes by so quickly. Jackie is an amazing trainer and I can't wait to buy her next dvd."
5,I cried during the abs workout.,"This dvd kicks my rear end. I usually do the 40 minute workout, which flies by. The lower body workout is challenging. But, what drives me to tears is the abs workout. I have a strong lower body and a very weak core. I usually have to stop several times during the upper abs workout. Immediately afterward I curse Jackie and tell her I hate her. All is forgiven an hour later, though, when I'm feeling tighter and firmer and even a little sore.Jackie is a great instructor. She has an easy personality and not at all bubbly. I like that she works out a bit and then focuses on form for every move. I know that if she tells me it should be burning and it's not then I'm doing something wrong.I highly recommend this dvd. It's to the point. Gets in and gets the job done. I do this dvd 2x a week in addition to my cardio workouts 3x a week to tone and tighten."
4,"Great, quick workout","I workout with a personal trainer 2x/week, walk/jog 2-3x/week and am always looking for a DVD workout to fill in the blanks. This DVD is perfect. On the days when I do this workout, I use the elliptical then select the 15-minute total body workout.....THAT'S RIGHT, A 15 MINUTE TOTAL BODY WORKOUT! I've been very happy with my results overall. I loved the 30 Day Shred DVD but developed low back issues after doing it every day. I've had no such issues with this DVD. Jackie is very conservative with her movements and stresses form over reps. Her cueing is perfect even if she gets annoying by claiming every exercise ""...is my favorite. I could do this all day."" Overall, I like her style and love the DVD."
3,Okay for quick brush up on the basics,"I thought the book was okay for a quick review but it is certainly not ""All you need to know."" I bought the book to quickly brush up on the basics as I was going to take a test from a potential employer. For the most part the code seemed correct, though brief. However, there is a serious error in the List example, specifically the overloading of operator =. The code itself works but it is more suited to a copy constructor than operator=. The authors forget that assigning can occur to a list that is already initialized and they make no provision for ensuring that the old list is destroyed. Using this code will result in a memory leak. The authors simply set the head pointer using operator new to create a new node and then go about copying the passed-in list. Old information is immediately lost."
5,Powerful and insightful ....,"This book is a great read.some of the stories made me cry and feel the writer's pain.There are stories of incest and rape,firstlove and menstration.This book is a must read for any women whohas been hurt by a man .For we all share a bond in sisterhood"
5,Great classic at algorithms,This is a excellent book for use in a first course of algorithms using C++ or other similar programming language. Covers usefull themes in a easy way.
4,An engaging read!,"I purchased this book without reading the backcover. It was only after I started reading the first few pages and then reading the back cover did I realize that this book is fiction. It disappointed me a bit but the book is still a very interesting read. Cristina's ""poor me"" attitude in the book was a bit overdone but it plays along with her real life character must have been like."
2,I wasn't too pleased....,"Like previous reviews I have read, I would definitley have to agree with them. I just had an overall bad feeling when I was finished reading this book. But like a previous reviewer stated, maybe that was my fault for choosing to ""learn"" about Frida through a fictional book. I was just left wondering ""What was true?, What did the author make up??""When I read that the author had invented a supposed sexual encounter Frida had with an underaged boy, I was SOO upset.Upset that the author would fabricate such a lie.In my eyes, that is a form of slander.If this book served *ANY* purpose at all for me, I'd say it just made me want to read a non-fictional book about Frida...and learn her true life stories."
1,WHAT A WASTE,"It looks like a great product, but it is impossible to get the mouse hooked up to recharge. Everytime I pick it up, I keep thinking that this time it will attach, but it doesn't."
1,Horrible!!!!!!!!! Avoid!!!,i wish i had seen these reviews before i bought this item. i am going to return it tomorrow to petsmart. doesn't hold a charge and only goes in reverse.
1,"Good in theory, poor in execution.","I read all the reviews so I pretty much knew what to expect. The only problem is no matter how long I have searched for a remote controlled mouse I cannot find any that have good reviews. Must be a common problem. I had several problems with this:1.) It was hard to get the connection needed to charge. It doesn't connect right and takes much longer than 45 seconds to charge.2.) It holds its charge must less time than it took to charge it in the first place. Why hasn't someone made a remote controlled mouse that has a small battery in it, like the ones they make for cat lasers? It seems most complaints are about how it doesn't hold the charge long. By the time my cat got interested in the toy it died on us and she hasn't wanted to play with it sense.3.) It was really expensive for how little it does!"
4,Don't have a real complaint,"I purchased this item at a Petland for $20. It was a lot, but at the time I wanted to find something for my evil kitty to play with that would keep her attention. I have had it for a few months and it works perfectly fine, sort of. The tail broke off due to me holding the mouse by its tail and my cat swiping at it, but the mouse still works okay without its tail. The other day when I was pushing the controller's antenna down the top part snapped. The mouse STILL works fine but I can't be too far away from it or else it won't move.Other than the parts breaking easily, I haven't had any other problems with this item."
4,Good Stuff,"Superb performances of local music by Washington DC roots musicians. Homegrown, but deserving of national attention- there is some excellent songwriting here (Joe Tripplett, Scott McKnight, Karl Straub and more) with fine musicianship and singing by Bill Kirchen, Mike Auldridge, John Starling, Kevin Johnson, Lisa Mosciatello, the Kennedys, and other noted area artists. Open your ears!"
4,Great local sound,"Have heard many of them in person, and love this CD. Hope they release one for the recent Americana Motel show (December 02)."
5,Modern Day Classic,"It's a shame that this show won't continue on Comedy Central. I myself had originally written it off as a sophomoric example of ""random comedy"", but having given it a second chance it turns out to be a sublime example of intelligent surrealist humor. It runs the gamut through spoof, satire, irony, metahumor and all the while David, Michael and Michael knowingly wink at the camera.It is a safe assertion to call this a modern day Monty Python. This is the funniest sketch comedy show (even though it isn't really sketch comedy) since Mr. Show With Bob And David."
5,YAAAAAYYYYY!,"This show is awesome. Michael, Michael, and David create some of the most original humor out there today. Granted, some of the episodes are train wrecks, but that doesn't take away from their hilarity. They are repeatedly watchable, because there will always be at least one joke that you forgot about, and the more you watch it, the funnier it gets. Beware the tagline, this comedy is incredibly dumb, but if you treat it as such, you will not stop laughing. Bottom line, buy this DVD."
4,good quality but...,my wife doesn't like this styling :(by the way - quality is good. it looks exactly as in pictures.
5,A great price for hot stockings,"I buy my wife lingerie pretty frequently, and since she is a big girl(former college athlete) it's hard to find her size/length. Stumbled onto lingerie section on Amazon, now look here first! Pay twice as much for ""Big Girl"" sizes online or in ""adult stores"" other places, same manufacturer, etc. Great deal"
2,Not very flattering,The fishnet part was okay. What I did not like (on myself) were the cut outs on the sides of the hips. Not very flattering for those who are not thin in that area.
4,Interesting,Loved the scenery and story was fairly good. One of her early works. recommend to those who want a quick light read.
2,But a GOOD 2 stars...,"Hey; for this price, you have to pretty much expect four truly bad movies... and this set doesn't disappoint at all in that regard. But they're bad in an Ed Wood sort of way. Lots of fun to watch, and some suprising gore for the time (although the lame special FX kind of spoil things a bit). This is the kind of thing you just sit back with on a lazy afternoon or night, and just watch right through, without paying too much attention to the bad acting and worse plotlines. ""Pieces,"" which features amazing scenery-chomping by both Christopher and Linda Day George (her ""triple-b scream"" is unintentionally hilarious) is alone worth the price of admission!"
3,Does not fit Dewalt or Porter Cable Miter Saw,Not sure what the adapter is for but it is not for miter saws. It is made of soft rubber and seems well made... just can not find a use for it.
5,TOOL ADAPTOR,"THIS IS THE BEST, AND PROBABLY THE ONLY TOOL ADAPTOR OUT THERE. I HAVE A SHOP VAC THAT HAS 2 DIFFERENT SIZED HOSES THAT DID NOT FIT THE EXHAUST ON MY SANDER, THE COMPANY DID NOT MAKE AN ADAPTOR TO REMEDY THIS PROBLEM, SO I FOUND THE ADAPTOR AT MY LOCAL HARDWARE STORE, CUT IT TO FIT THE SANDER, AND PLACED IT ON MY SHOP VAC HOSE. THE HOSE NOW STAYS ON THE SANDER FOR ALL DIFFERENT TYPES/HEIGHTS OF SANDING. THIS TOOL SOLVED A MAJOR PROBLEM OF KEEPING THE DUST IN MY WORK AREA DOWN. THIS ADAPTOR IS A MUST FOR EVERY OWNER OF A SANDER, ROUTER, PLANER, OR ANY OTHER PORTABLE POWER TOOL THAT GENERATES SOME TYPE OF DUST."
3,Disapppointed that Tasha Tudor did not sanction.,"I was disappointed in the books contents. Although I expected an extensive bibliography (which is very thorough and interesting), I was hoping for a more inclusive book of her life, art, illustrations, etc. I expected a more ""colorful"" book with more pictures of both her and her work."
1,Not for Lefthanders,"I am left handed and found these shears to be on average as good/bad as the pair of 10 year old shears I purchased the Friskars to replace. They work better if I use my right hand, but I still have to hold the grass tightly with one hand and shear with the other or the grass gets clogged in the crotch of the two blades. Using my left hand they get clogged more often than not."
3,Simple Reference,"This book shows how to perform various crochet stitches, as stated. It is a basic book, with black and white and gray pictures throughout. I will say that it seems a little dated, but the information is still valid, and it's a good reference if you're looking to be reminded about how to perform certain stitches. However, I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who is completely new to crochet, as it's difficult to learn some of the stitches from black and white pictures. Someone who is more advanced at crocheting might be better-served by some of the newer crochet books out there with COLOR pictures. Rather dry and basic, but still informative."
3,Hard to Pull Apart,"Not sure about parakeets but I got this size for my Cockatiel and she enjoyed them but she had a hard time. They are quite hard, and stuck very well together. Also, they advertise themselves as being a good diet. These treats are nothing more than seed stuck together with honey, and I'd not advice giving more than one or two a day. Deceptive or not, they are the healthiest 'junk' treat readily available on the market."
5,"1959, Rome, and Dracula is getting married....","Count Dracula is about to marry the Moldavian Princess Asa Vajda in a move that will return him into the position of Lord of the Undead. Not only is Rome now full of vampires, all invited to his wedding, but also the Powers That Be have sent their own agents and assassins to deal with him, and the undead, once and for all. Think all the vampires every thought of, from Armand of Paris to Collins from America, meeting characters from the James Bond movies and other horror flicks. That's right, you have Bond, Frankenstein's monster, Russian agents, and a few others that I'll keep to myself. I don't want to spoil it for the rest of you. Think of it as the who's who of just about everybody. Be warned - the title has been changed, so this is third book with a new title."
3,"Good tool, but unnecessary","I already own the ""grid"" foam roller from Trigger Point therapy. I was expecting this product to be substantially firmer. It has the consistency that is just firmer than that of a new tennis ball. It does work well on the front and side of your leg, but has issues with the underside due to it's lower profile than the foam roller. I love their foam roller and highly recommend that along with one or two lacrosse balls (they're cheaper and just as effective as the TP ones) from your local sports store. Unfortunately, since I own the previously mentioned products I find this one somewhat unnecessary."
3,its plastic,"The price could have been better on cheap stamp plastic part courtesy of China. This comes in a huge box. At least shipping with prime is free. I was looking at my local stores, but nothing in stock...I really needed this the day I purchased from amazon but used alternative methods to vac my vehicle...now its sitting in the garage unused."
2,Not good in the cold weather.,The cover became very brittle in the cold weather (low to mid-teens) causing it to crack and rip after only using it for 1 month.
2,Not really usable.,The sound coming out of the microphone sounds terrible. Also the microphone does not come across the head far enough to get picked up.
2,Unless you have small ears....,"Unless you have small ears, this product may not be for you. Not very comfortable. The sound quality is what you would expect from a $10 pair of headphones. This isn't a hidden gem that you spend little money for and get a good procut. You get what you pair for with these."
3,Great but a little small on ears,"This headset is great, it sounds great and nice quality for the price!! although wireless would have been better it has a nice long cord so you can walk away from the computer if you have to. Also- the only downfall we found is the foam is a little small causing slight discomfort if you wear it for any length of time but it is a great starter headset!!"
3,The Mic Wouldn't Work...,This is a good headset and for the longest time I didn't need to use the mic BUT when I did (several months after I had bought it) it just would not work. I was very disappointed because I didn't expect for a technically brand new mic not to work.
4,Decent.,"This headset has a great sound quality and microphone,which is good for the price.The only negative thing I have about this headset is that the ear cushioning is very uncomfortable and my ears were aching for a while after wearing them."
1,"Save your money, buy something else.","Save your money! This product is defective. The headset is made from cheap plastic that breaks easily. Unfortunately my headset broke past the return deadline, and Amazon will not give me a full refund. Its now completely useless. Don't make the same mistake I did!!! Save yourself the trouble and buy a higher quality headset. Amazon should not be pushing defectives products to its costumers."
2,Lackluster product. Lousy packaging.,"The sound quality is okay; there seems to be some static in the headphone speakers that I have not been able to isolate. I'm not sure if this is poor connections or just cheap components. I'm told the mic is crystal clear by people on the other side of video chats.My single biggest complaint is the packaging. Hard plastic, sonic-welded packaging is really hard to open without damaging one's hands. There is an easy-open flap on the back side, but this allows access only to the backing card and you still need to somehow cut everything else out. In spite of solid (and freshly sharpened) shears, I still managed to lacerate my hand on the package.5 stars; -1 for static in the phones, -2 for bad packaging."
2,Pretty bad,"I actually bought this headset several years ago from a popular department store. Within a couple of months, the earpads had come off of the headset. They are held on by a thin fabric, and that fabric tore from the headset being taken off and put back onto my head. I still have them now because I use them mainly for the microphone -- the pads are duct taped back onto the main unit.The pads on these will fail quickly within normal use, and the headphones are uncomfortable to the point of uselessness without the pads.The product does have decent sound, thanks to the pads creating a more enclosed listening environment. They are a bit too heavy on the bass for my tastes. The microphone is mediocre; it sounds bad to me but none of my associates on Skype or through Ventrillo have complained."
4,Good for use with Skype,"I've been using this headset with Skype for about a month now. Considering the low price, the sound quality and mic work great. Very little background noise is picked up. Definitely recommend this headset for VOIP if you're looking for something in the low price range."
1,This isn't worth any amount of money,"We have now had 2 of these headsets and both have failed the exact same way. After a week of use and only with language application by one person, they lose stereo and a lot of noise is introduced into anything you try to listen to there after. We try the headset with different computers and applications and it is the same.Don't listen to someone that claims these work great for education or for gaming. The are cheap and poorly made, NOT inexpensive and a bargin. And now because of the time it took to send us a replacement plus the week or so to fail, we now can no longer get our money back or a replacement. Total rip off. Do NOT buy. Pay a little more for a quality brand.Cyber AcousticsStereo Headset/Microphone, Ambidextrous design AC-201"
5,Great purchase!,Purchased these in bulk for use in the schools. Students are using them with computer programs that need microphones. They have good clarity and are holding up well. Would/will purchase more as needed.
1,Abismal Sound from the mircrophone,"Fortunately these cheap headphone were exactly that, cheap. I paid a little over $10 dollars and tried them out today and the mic sound is so weak it is sad. If this were and expensive item I would return them, but I will just junk them or use them for music only. Should be a volume control inline on these so you might improve the mic volume. Oh well it is what it is."
3,Headphone Pads,My experience was that these headphones combined mediocre sound quality with earpads that came off especially easily. It took less then a month to render useless.
3,"Not Bad, but doesn't worth money",it's not bad in sound and voice quality but it does not have mute buttonalso the form in ear pads is so weak and looks like can fall any time
4,it worth the price,"this headset is in a good quality, the quality of audio is ok. But it will be better if the headset can adjust volume."
3,Not my favorite but OK,I have 3 headsets and this set is my 3rd choice. Just not very comfortable for my big head. Might fit my kids more comfortably. The ears are soft enough I guess and block out noise. Being in sales I record my calls and playback for review and the sound quality in and out sounds with too high treble sound.
2,Not recommended.,"I got these because they were inexpensive, but in retrospect I wish I had gotten something else. The headphones are very uncomfortable and the microphone picks up background noise that can't be removed from actual audio."
2,No volume control,"It's a great deal for these headphones, but be advised there is NO way to adjust the volume. They are very loud. Instead of returning them, I was lazy and put cotton balls in the ear pieces and that worked to muffle the loudness."
3,1 out of 2 headsets failed within 6 months,"I bought two of these headsets for my small business to use on Skype (our main phone line). The headset which sees the most use broke after roughly 6 months and 120 hours of use. Callers often complained about low microphone volume, even though the Windows mic volume and the Skype volumes are maxed out. The headsets press on the side of my head a bit more firmly than is necessary, especially since I wear glasses and it starts to hurt during long conversations. The audio is great and it's a piece of cake to use - just plug it in.You should consider using this headset if you don't want to spend a lot of money and don't plan to use it too often, or if you don't mind replacing it regularly with heavy use."
2,Crappy piece of junk,"Got mine, 2 days after I bought them the ear padding in the left ear fell off and it keeps falling off after that. Now a couple of minutes ago the left earpiece completely detached itself from the body, dangling from a couple of cheap wires. Do not but, spend a couple of more bucks and get something that will last more than a couple of days."
2,this headset,"This headset is cheap and easy to use at 1 major cost: comfort. Fully extended this headset doesnt quite cover my ears (i have a regular sized head, most mics i actually have to make them as small as possible) and it also feels like its trying to squeeze my ears together as a result. i dont recommend this mic unless u have a very very small head lol"
5,Smart Design and Lightweight Comfort,"I received my Cyber Acoustics AC-201 a couple of weeks ago and am very happy with it. The sound quality is excellent and the sleek, lightweight design with adjustable head band and ultra-soft leatherette pads that fit on top of the ear are relatively comfortable for my sensitive ears. I have had trouble in the past with flimsy microphone attachments that break on cheap sets. The AC-201 has extra support in this area with the additional design feature of adjusting so the mic may be placed on either the left or right side. I haven't owned the set long enough to vouch for its durability, but for this low price tag, if it lasts for a few months I'll be a satisfied customer and buy another AC-201 to replace it."
4,Sound clarity is good,I bought this item thru amazon.com last week (Sept 1st week). Its working fine and Quality is very good. Liked it. Worth 10$
1,Horrible even for cheap headphone/mic,"I had owned these previously and the previous pair lasted 2 years. However it seems they have changed the design and kept the model name, making these even cheaper in quality than the older version.This new design (with the same model number)The microphone went in and out starting on day one and finally died on day 60. Yes they are cheap but the quality is even below par with the price."
3,It's OK,I was super impressed with the seller processing of my order--I think they did an awesome job by sending the product to my place within just about a week. I'd recommend anyone who may want to buy stuff to by from this seller. I am not so sure about the product itself...'coz it's not been too long since I got it. I would say it's OK.
3,needed badly but did not meet my standards,I could not find any shop vac bags in my area to purchase. I needed these ever so badly. They tear very easy. Not a very sturdy paper product.
2,The Three Bears,"I purchased this book for my grandchildren. I am not happy with the illustrations, the wee little bear was bigger than mama bear, and they had a blurry look. The story had cuts, not a good book."
3,UNFORTUNATELY CUT VERY BAD,I LOVE THIS MOVIE TOO MUCH THE MUSIC FROM TANGERINE DREAM IS SO GoOD AND THE STORY IS VERY CAPTIVANT BUT THERE IS A PROBLEME WITH THIS DVD IT IS COMPLETELY CUT ALL THE VIOLENT SCENES ARE NOT SHOWED SO DON T BUY IT I WANT A DVD ZONE 1 UNCUT AND I WANT CHAINED HEAT UNCUT TOO SO PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Not how it's advertised... Hello, Amazon??? You are doing this more and more!!","Here we go again with false advertising on products. The DVD photo has obviously nothing to do with what Amazon is advertising here. I went to other sources on the web where there was a breakdown that these are, in fact, shorts of classic actors such as W.C. Fields, and not the game show ""The Joker's Wild"" as Amazon advertises here. This isn't the first time people have been misled by this. I lost money a few times because the product was not the same as advertised by Amazon. My advice is verify things elsewhere before buying when it comes to something rare like this."
1,huge disappointment,"used the small shop vac (received for a wedding present) less than five times,all just for vacuuming carpet in the car. toppled over on its side once and began to smell hot and made outrageous noise. engineers where i work took it apart and said grounding wire/screw/brushings had problems that rendered it unfixable. since it was a gift, i can't return to place of sale. so sad someone wasted money on it. we will not purchase another one."
3,Someone is pulling your cord...,"I think it is safe to assume that this is NOT a 6.25 HP vacuum. On a 115 volt circuit this would pull over 40 amps (or 20 amps on a 230 volt circuit.) This is more HP than most dust collection systems that are made to handle several large tools. Compare this with the Shop-Vac 610-50 10 Gallon Industrial Duty Stainless Steel Wet/Dry Vac that is rated at 1.7HP: a little more believable. (But many of the other Shop-Vac vacuums have overzealous HP ratings, peak HP or not, someone is pulling your cord.)"
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE,"I have been a fan for years, and this is by FAR the worst CD yet put out by Oasis. Amateur, uninspired, just thrown together rubbish. If anyone thought ""Standing on the Shoulder of Giants"" was lame, PLEASE LISTEN TO ME, save your money on ""Heathen Chemistry"". The glory days are gone........"
5,A Return to a New Form,"After the mediocre and bland ""Be Here Now"" and ""Standing on the Should of Giants"", this was a make or break record for Oasis, and they have delivered a rocking return to the spotlight. Good mix of songs from the thumping and sneering ""The Hindu Times"" and ""Hung in a Bad Place"" to softer ballads like ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out"" and ""Little by Little"". Start to finish a great listen, perhaps not as endearing as thier sophomore effort, ""What's the Story, Morning Glory"", but excellent nonetheless."
4,Lets get some things straight,"People...Noel is the elder of the Gallaghers, and Liam is the younger. This album is fantastic, and makes up very much for all of their shortcomings as individuals (ie Liam's public brawls). However, many people seem to regard Liam as the better singer, but Noel's voice does not have that annoying whine that Liam seems to embrace. I rather like Noel's voice and think that he should try to sing more often!!"
2,A Tired And Uninspiring Album,"I had been a fan of Oasis and their first three albums in the 90's. I loved the arena pop rock they created, the songwriting of Noel and the whiney and harsh vocals of Liam. But I can't seem to enjoy ""Heathen Chemistry"" as much as I want to. Their last effort ""On The Shoulder Of Giants"" (was my least favorite album til now) yet had some good moments that ""Heathen Chemistry"" lacks. The songs seem boring and contrived. ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out"" and ""Hindu Times"" are not great, but okay. They stand out as the best of the album, because everything else isn't all that good. ""Little By Little"" is really the only song that I like. And that's a shame. Maybe Noel needs to go back and write all of the music again. Because ""Heathen Chemistry"" is a mixed bag of different people with different ideas, and it dissapointingly shows."
3,The straight news on Hindu Times,"Okay. Here it is (you can ignore all the other reviews). Hindu Times is a good Oasis album. It is not great, especially when compared to earlier albums - reviewers might be inclined to give the album five stars because they are reeling from the awful Standing on the Shoulders of Giants. For any other group, an album like Hindu Times would get four stars, but since Oasis is capable of so much more ... only three.There are some very good songs on Hindu Times, but the album does not compare to the group's first three albums (I liked Be Here Now, am I the only one?).I like to think of Hindu Times as a big step in the right direction, but just a step.Let's hope Oasis' next offering continues the trend.For the real Oasis fan, this album will be a treat (maybe helping to erase the bad taste SOTSOG left). If you are not a true fan, well, you probably didn't know Hindu Times existed anyway."
1,heathen chemistry,"I wish this band would snap out of the Beatle obsession and do one thing that may sound original. We ALL love the Beatles but for crying out loud ""move on man"" get over it.Obviously this bands popularity grew because of the younger generation that missed the british invasion of the 60's (including the members of Oasis) and want to somehow make up. (monkey see, monkey do) lets write some NEW music here!!"
2,Lost it,"This album is by far the weakest of all there previous efforts. They have lost there way, except for 2-3 tracks, the cd on whole is weak and uninspired. They have run out of ideas for songs and these seem rehashed."
4,A very good rock album,"For all of their occasionally stupid behavior and a couple of really weak albums, it's nice to have someone like the Gallagher brothers in a world full of personality and swagger-free bands. I can't say I'm -that- much of an Oasis fan, but this album is pretty damn good from start to finish except for the pointless instrumental bit near the end. The opener ""Hindu Times"" is excellent, although the main riff does sound a bit like U2's ""Even Better Than the Real Thing""... but then again it's nice to see Oasis borrowing from some other band than the Beatles (hehe, only joking). For all it's cliche-ridden lyrics, ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out"" is an undeniable heart-tugging show-stopper, ""Better Man"" is a great dirty little number, and the rest of the songs are almost as strong and catchy. So, nothing particularly new, but then Oasis never pretended to reinvent the wheel and this album is full of great, solid rock music."
5,Trim with ease.,When I first saw it I didn't think much of it but when I started to use it my expectations were met with an easy to use garden tool. I have about a dozen trees that I trim around and raised garden beds that are made from block walls. We had put a single row of 6 inch paving stones at the base to help with mowing closer to the wall. With the long-handled grass shears it is alot easier to trim at the walls. When I was a kid my father had a pair of the long handled grass shears and used to use them. I had looked for a pair for at least 2 years in every garden center and hardware store in my area with no luck. Thank you Fiskars for bringing back a useful gardening tool. I LOVE IT.
2,Save your money!,I bought this product for the times when the edges of my garden bed and grass around my foundation need a little trim in between weed whacking. This product requires a lot of work for minimal results. The blades are not very sharp and I found it difficult to trim grass close to the foundation. I do not advise trying to cut more than 5 blades of grass at a time. It guess its back to full time weed whacking.
4,GRASS SHEARS,I FOUND THAT MY HANDS BECAME VERY TIRED HOLDING THE SHEARS. PERFORMANCE-WISE IT DID A GREAT JOB CUTTING SMALL AREAS WHERE THE LAWN MOWER COULD NOT REACH PREVENTING HAVING TO BEND OR KNEEL TO CUT THESE AREAS.IT IS NOT A GOOD TOOL FOR ANYONE WITH ARTHRITIS THATS FOR SURE. I THINK IF IT HAD WHEELS ATTACHED THEN I WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE COMFORTABLE USING THEM. STILL IT BEATS BEING ON YOUR KNEES.
5,"Good Quality, Works Great","I bought a pair of these to trim the weeds around my fruit trees because the weedwacker was damaging the bark. It is a big plus that they are long enough to cut big weeds in between the bushes without having to worry about spider bites. They are built solid and work great even though they are very light in your hand. And it is comforting to know that even if my wife somehow managed to break them, Fiskar has great hassle free support and warranty support. With these, you get what you pay for."
5,hand shears,I do spot weed triming randomly whenever the mood strikes. These shears are perfect for grab and go. They are doing exactly what I was expecting and they do it with ease.
4,light and easy to use,light weight and easy to use. sticks when trying to cut a large amount but works great for simple trimming.
4,fiskers trimmer,am very pleased with the performance of this trimmer. sure saves a LOT of backache from bending!! the only upgrade i would suggest is WHEELS.....it would be so simple to roll it along with you!
5,Excellent Value - Saves Knees & Back,"Great design. Very sharp. Yes, the packing does seem excessive as posted in other reviews. I also like the Fiskars 6201 18-Inch 5-Blade Momentum Push Reel Lawn Mower."
4,GOOD ENOUGH,I have only used it one time & thought it was adequate for the size of my property that I will use it on. I did feel my hands were getting tired from operating it so if I had a larger area to clip I wouldn't like using it. Also it is a tool I was unable to find in local stores.
4,Difficult Areas to Mow,"Good for cutting & trimming where a mower can't reach especially along walls, edges and in between rocks.Saves wear and tear on the back by not bending and comfortable in the hand to operate."
1,Too many negative examples,"The plot suffers from far too many negative examples by the heroine. Most kids in age range for this content wouldn't be able to separate out the bad behavior of Snow White in the early movie from the good behavior later. To boot, the plot is limp, dialog stilted, and comic relief characters wholly unendearing."
1,Seriously?,"Ridiculous. Our family couldn't get past the first 15 minutes. The animation looks like you're watching Sims and movement is very jagged (not a streaming issue - it is an animation issue). Not quite sure who this is targeted to, awful for little kids and too amateur for anyone else to enjoy, and jokes/puns are not funny at all."
4,better than expected,"better than expected based on the poor reviews. my kids enjoyed it. the princess was bratty at the beginning of the movie but there was some redemption. animation was poor, but overall entertaining."
2,CHILL album,"It's the kind of album you'd listen to if you wanna unwind, or even fall asleep. The group sounds as good as ever, bringing real soul and passion to their performances but unfortunately much of their record consists of average, unremarkable material. i bought this in cassette mainly because of 'the Arms of the one who loves you' (which is better released in radio edit)."
5,Pruning Without Stilts,"At 5'3"", I've always had trouble pruning trees and bushes that were just out of my reach. Standing on a step-stool in the garden not only was inconvenient, but not very safe, either. Now that I am 55, my hands are beginning to show the effects of arthritis, too.I read about this pruning device in one of my gardening magazines and decided it was worth a try. WOW! What a pruner!Not only does it allow me to prune branches up to 1-1/4"" in diameter that are out of my reach, the mechanism doesn't hurt my hands, either. What a smooth and effortless cut!I would recommend this lifesaver to anyone who is seeking a better solution to what seems like a full-time garden job."
5,Pruning Stick,"I love this tool. It is convenient and remains sharp after a lot of use. The operating mechanism is smooth, the tool can reach spots that are difficult to attack with small hand pruners, and it can handle larger limb sizes (up to an inch in diameter I'd say)."
5,Great Speakers,"I bought these on a whim. They were packed very well. They arrived with a ding or two from shipping, but with something this heavy I expected that. They sound great. Great speakers for the price. Thank you Amazon"
4,Frommer's Beijing,I love to see picture on traveling books. This one does not have too many pictures. I wish they will insert more picture in it. It's nothing like seeing the actual thing in picture before you get to the destination.
5,redesign success story,"I was distraught when my little 1-gallon shop-vac died recently. My roommate and I had used it for about 10 years as our primary vacumm--lightweight, easy to carry around the house, and it sucked up all the dirt and dog hair my pooch could bring in. The one-gallon vac is no longer available, so I bought this one. This vac is much improved over the old one--quieter, slightly larger capacity, has wheels and a longer hose, and we can now use the disposable bags or still just use the ""bucket"". All in all, they've taken a great product and made it even better. If it lasts as long as the old one, I'll be even happier!"
5,Entering Crone,I love this book.It's about time someone wrote for Crones by Crones.Wish there were more books like this it is humorous and insightful.I hoe to read more from this Author and other Crones.
4,Great album,"I listened to Ben's Brother live last week in Seattle, and I was hooked to the music from the start, I'd love to see them live again but, in the meantme, the Album will do. Great find!"
1,This game sucks ***,"This game sucks big time. You get killed the very first round, the controls you have to use are sucky, this whole game just sucks. Whoever enjoyed it must be on crack. It is a wasted 50 bucks"
1,game was bad,"I bought this game cheap used....now i know why. The game was not good at all and the controls were very hard to control. I will admit it was a different kind of game, just not a good one."
3,Buckets of blood or at least red paint,"The 10 DVDs in this collection are very uneven in quality. The Streetfighter movies have the best quality of the group. The samurai movies are not so hot (sorry Sonny, Toshiro Mifune you aren't). But at this price, its good fun and worth it just for the Streetfighter movies. My favorite scene in 'Return of the Streetfighter' is when Sonny whacks a bad guy in the head and the baddie's eyes pop out of his head (my teenage sons found this particularly hilarious)."
2,Poor Video Taken Indoors,I bought the ZR90 about 2 year back when I had my first kid as I wanted to keep home videos of the kids. Frankly I am terribly dissappointed at at the quality of the pictures in the house with all the lights on in the house. My sons first birthday video's are all so dissapointingly dark. One mistake I did is not going to stored and checkign out the camera before I ordered it online. I suggest goin to a retailer and checking out the picture quality indoors before ordering it online.Outside pictures in bright sunlight are okay. I am not a phony reviewer trying to trash the product. If you click on my name you will see all the other products I have reviewed.
2,ZR series,"2 star rating-BUT I don't have this particular item. I have a ZR60 and LCD screen suddenly went black. We have not used this camcorder that much over the last 3 years (have about 6-7 complete tapes) and it would cost over 200.00 to repair so the ZR85 was recommended for close to the cost of repair(the batteries and tapes would fit the same, etc). THANKS for the info on this camcorder! I think we will continue to look (maybe Sony?). Consumer reports says repairs are higher on the Canon's than any other camcorder...."
5,Good Action,"The assisted open on this knife is very smooth and easy to use. It has a solid feel and it pretty sharp, typical of most gerber products."
3,True Fan,"This is a CD for the hard core EWF fans.It sounds more like a glorified rehearsal then a real concert.Why do I say this ..?? Because the live tracks on Graditude and The Eternal Vision were so much better and the tempos on these two CD's are ""tighter"" and played with more energy. On some of the ""Alive in 75"" tracks, the tempo even ""slowed"" down a bit and why was ""Evil"" only 3 minutes..?? All that said I still brought the CD and I listen to it quite otfen and I know that I would enjoy it more if not for Graditude and The Eternal Vision CD's."
1,Terrible,"A piece of junk. I couldn't even move it without it skipping, if I could get it to work at all. Buy something from Sony or even Phillips, anything but this."
3,O.K. but not my favorites,"O.K. but for black licorice, I would prefer good-old black licorice or black licorice jelly beans. Not what I expected."
2,Not a gummi,"I was disappointed in this item because I was expecting a true gummi texture. Instead, the texture is more like the regular licorice twists. The licorice flavor also seemed to be a little weak to me. I would not recommend this item for a true gummi fan."
1,poor quality,"The handle tore out of the bag the first time I used it. A very good idea, but VERY poor quality. The fabric is just not strong enough. If you buy this, DON'T use the handles, or better yet, save your money."
3,Get the Hard-Bottomed One!,"Fiskars now makes a hard-bottomed variety of this product. This one wears out quickly and the spring protudes from the bottom, which is both inconvenient and dangerous. Spend a few more bucks for the hard-bottomed one."
4,Gardening Container,"I got tire of struggling with bags when trying to load up weeds, limbs, etc. Yard bags would blow over or blow away. Now I can put my yard bag in this container and it stays put. It doesn't hold 30 gal. trash bags (they are too little), but will try the construction sized bags to use with it next. The guy who is doing some landscaping for me wants one too."
2,Do not last as long as the earlier bags.,"Being a professional gardener, I have used these Fiskar Kangaroo bags for 10 or so years. Previously the bags were tough and well made. They would last a season of gardening. Now they are so cheaply made we are lucky to get a month or so out of them before the bottoms tear and the wires come out, which makes them useless. I would rather pay more if Fiskars would have kept the same quality as the original bags."
4,Great for yard work,Perfect yard back support when collecting grass clippings and leaves in the yard. I only wish it had a built in clips or some sort of bag liner holder at the top. I am using binder clips for now.
1,Total nonsense!,Batra's 1985 prediction of a world-wide depression in 1990 did not happen. This guy continues to pump out economic trash. Those who buy his books - - and believe Batra's wild-eyed rantings and ravings - - are in serious need of help. Get a life!
2,Buyer Beware!!,"I really needed a pouch for my phone and after trying to get one from my phone carrier, to no avail, I decided to order this pouch from Amazon. It holds my phone pretty well, but the slot to charge the phone is in the wrong place. It is on the bottom of the phone instead of the side. If I had been given this information before I ordered this item, I probably would have not gotten it."
4,Great for on the go!,This is the perfect little bag for your razor. It can attach to your handbag or schoolbag. There is a space for the speaker so you can hear your phone ring. It's cute. There was an odor to it when it arrived. I left it out overnight and it was fine.
3,Just Teen wolf,"I don't know who had the idea to sell these movies together, ""Teen wolf"" it's a great movie of the 80's, very original and with good actors. Michael J. Fox makes one of his bet performs, withour need of SFX and sophisticated make up. I still enjoy the movie and wish more movies like this one were made. Enjoy ""Teen wolf"""
1,very flimsy,I regret buying this item . I bought two sets from this company and if the bags had not already been opened I would retuerthem. Suffice it to say I will never purchase this type of toy from this manufactuer again.
2,Many broken pieces- Better quality products out their,"Many broken pieces, especially the cannons and anything with wheels. One of the army figures was missing a head. Other than that ok. I know better quality civil war men are available."
2,Too Sweet Than Sour,"I was really disappointed when I got these. I love chewy stuff, so I figured I would try these out. Instead of them being sour they were more on the sweet side, and it was not a good sugary sweet taste either. I opened a couple of bags to see if it was the same for all of them, and sadly it was... the bags were not expired, but they had a very odd taste to them. I also found that they had an inconsistent softness. Some were chewy and others were hard. I will not be ordering these again."
4,Understanding Indian political Economics.,"Its a wonderful book for all those who are interested in India or for that matter even those who aren't.I'm sure in the last decade or so Indian Economy has shown promising growth, which makes it impossible to undermine importance of India in overall Global trade.This book throws light on the economic path that India followed after Independence and the influence of Politics in the initial phase and the absence of the same on the Economy in the last few years.Very good reading with sound analytical observations."
1,Fooled by the reviews.,"It is a 3-card ""booklet"" and has only 10 knots. It does not include some of the better and more practical knots I already know from other books. One knot is for fly fishing only. Worse is the illustration , I still can't figure out how to make one of the knots. I just threw $4.95 into the water. Better buy a comprehensive fishing book, which will introduce you to many knots in a much clearer way."
5,Good little guide,Fisherman's Ultimate Knot Guide is a great little guide worth the money takes up very little room and keeps the rust out when it's been awhile since you tied those knots.
2,Overpriced,"If this were $1 at a gas station, I think it'd be fair to say you got what you paid for, but even at $4.95, when you add in shipping, it is way over priced. It is my own fault for not reading the descriptions and checking out the pictures a little better, but this is a cheap product that's sold for at least 5 times more than it's worth."
1,Doesn't Work,"The body fat analyzer on this scale does not work. My husband, who had lost a lot of weight, weighs 130 at 6'. He's all skin and bones and it said he had a 43% body fat! It's just not possible! I'm not sure about the accuracy of the scale part, because I haven't been weighed anywhere else, but after reading the other reviews I'm seriously considering finding out!"
1,no results after two months,"I have been using this device twice a day, 120 repetition each time, have gone from resistance band 6 to 8.No results. I took a before and after picture and my face looks worse! with all of these reviews stating they got results in two days or a week I start to believe they are using a different product. BIG disappointment."
2,Overpriced,"This product is mostly marketing, hype, packaging, and fancy videos. I used the exerciser once and realized that I could do a much better job by just holding my fingers in the corners of my mouth to give resistance."
1,I Don't See a Change,"I used this every day for several weeks. I upped the bands to the next level too. I'm not sure if maybe I have it in wrong? But I noticed no difference in my jowls or cheeks at all. I also watched a video of how to use it on QVC and I think I was using it correctly. I don't have really bad jowls, but I'm 52 and they are there."
5,Love Love Love!!!,"I recieved this camera as a requested gift on my 28th b-day back in September and I absolutely love it! I have a 20 mo. old baby girl and this camera is perfect for documenting her everyday cuteness. I love the quality of the pictures and the videos as well. Her grandparents live in Oklahoma and we are in Seattle, so it's great for sending picture and video e-mail. The camera is very easy to use, and once I really got into the users manual I learned some really cool things about the cameras features. Purple is my favorite color, so the vivacious violet was an obvious choice. The color is only the begining... This is an amazing camera for someone who wants quality pictures and videos of everyday life. I would give it 10 stars if I could! My only complaint is the flash is a little weak at night, but from what I understand, there is an extra attachment that can be purchased for a stronger flash, so no big deal really."
3,Canon Powershot SD30--Not that great,"I have to say I was not impressed that much with this camera. For one, night shots are horrible. there is so much grain, with no flash, with flash, with lots of light, it just doesn't seem to matter.Also it has a warped lens. It seems on the edges of pictures it warps. Like if you take a picture of a building, the edges with be wavy. It's a little quirky.It does take great day pictures though. It has great color with pictures with sunlight and it's super compact. But as a whole I would look for another canon product for my next digital camera."
2,Flimsy blade,I have just finished pruning 110 rose bushes with these pruners. About 30% of my cuts were bungled because the blade quickly dulled and it easily flexes to prevent a clean bypass cut. Otherwise the pruners facilitate cutting large branches and the spring works well.
4,Great blades,"I finally broke down and bought a more expensive pair of pruners than usual. The blades on these are great! Small branches and more cut easily, quickly and cleanly. They are certainly a lot more comfortable to hold than the cheap $7 sheers I've purchased in the past.My biggest issue with them so far is the orange hold-close tab broke almost immediately. They have a life time warranty, but of course I threw away the receipt and all of the packing materials."
3,"I love hello kitty, but I don't love this toaster","Got this about 2 years ago for Christmas because my family knows how much of a Hello Kitty freak I am. The pros are that it is pretty darn cute and it hasn't managed to break yet, but as with all the hello kitty appliances this thing is just crappy quality. As many people have said, you basically have to burn your toast to a crisp if you want to see hello kitty's face, but it also NEVER cooks evenly. One side of the bread will be lightly toasted and one side will be practically burnt. I have to put the heat setting down the lowest it will go and toast it once, then flip the bread around and toast it again on low. SO annoying. I'm ready for a grown-up toaster now."
3,not clear hello kitty image,"This toaster does what is suppose to do like every toasters do. But hello kitty image is not clear enough on bread, not even when the toast get dark. So this is why i scored it with three stars."
4,Adorable toaster!,"I got one of these toasters about three years ago as a present. I just love it!It does really toast Hello Kitty's face on to the bread. I had no problems with the toaster until recently. It started sparking and the bread would pop up before it was fully toasted.I just ordered another one from Amazon online. Target stores carry this item only during the holidays, so if you can wait that long, you can avoid the shipping fees.I would definitely recommend this toaster despite my problems with it because it lasted three years."
1,"If these movies come on the late night double feature, it is definitely for a reason.","Both of these movies are boring and forgettable. I thought Klaus Kinski was absoluted disgusting in his role as that peeping-tom freak, so I guess he was good for that part, but I still did not like either of these movies because they were so boring. I thought the storylines were completely uncompelling and poorly executed. If one is better than the other, Crawlspace would be the better of the two, but that is not saying much, but at least it saves this DVD from getting zero stars, which is pretty close to what it deserves. If you are having trouble sleeping, put this DVD in, and your insomnia will be cured."
3,More Midnite Madness,"The MGM ""Midnite Movies"" series keeps its streak going with another entertaining release. Hey, all the movies in this series aren't fabulous, but they've all been at least perfectly watchable, some even much better than that. And it helps that these rescued-from-obscurity movies have mostly all been presented to us in the form of sharp, clean, widescreen prints. This is is the case with both ""The Attic"" and ""Crawlspace"", both of which I'd rate as ""watchable-plus"" in the entertainment department. In other words, they're both ultimately pretty average, but laced with interesting, offbeat moments here and there. Unlike other Midnite Movies releases, however, there isn't much in the value-added department here (meaning extras). Oh, well-- you can't have everything. Still, for the price you can't beat it."
1,EQ no more,"I bought this hoping to revive my love for a game I played years ago. However, it just reminded me why I quit in the first place. SoE was/is a staple in the mmorpg community, but I think their time has come and went.Pros: Pretty graphics (especially considering the time period of it's original release) and fun classes/races.Cons: Frustrating questlines, corpse runs, and experience loss upon death."
4,great book!,"I really enjoyed this book. It is about a young,country girl who goes though high school. It tells about her troubles (her Father), boyfriend, friends, & other normal high stuff. It is reather sad,but very good."
1,DVR....Not DVD.,"Picture & sound quality rate 1 star, movie itself, rates 2 stars.Horrible transfer brings little enjoyment of this movie.Defeats the whole reason for having DVD.As for the movie itself, low budget ""southern gothic"", slasher film.Last film role for Agnes Moorehead. She's wonderful in the film, but even she can't save this dud of a movie. In the same vein as Dementia 13."
1,The Embroiderer's Handbook,"Racism has NO place in this day and age and to find it in an otherwise quality embroiderer's guide, is appalling and offensive. Suppose instead of being directed at first nations women it read like this; Lazy Nig... Stitch or Lazy Chin... Stitch instead of ""Lazy Squaw Stitch"". Quite shocking in that context correct? Just as shocking and inexcusable when used by the author Margie Bauer and published by an otherwise ethically responsible company, David & Charles (F & W Media Inc.). I strongly suggest renaming the stitch and a more conscientious approach to editing in the future."
3,Expected More But I Recommend,"I expected a lot more when I saw Danny Glover was the lead. This is clearly a movie made on a modest budget, the battle scenes appear to be missing a lot of extras and the action scenes are really dull. Also the dialog seemed very superficial and the movie did give sufficient time to develop the characters- particularly why the soldiers were given name Buffalo Soldiers. It would be nice to see a remake of this film with a real budget and longer movie to fully develop characters and overall story line of Indian Wars and how the Buffalo Soldiers were torn between fighting for a country that despised them almost as much as the Native Americans."
3,"Dora's ""Move to the Music""","This is not one of the better Dora videos. The first episode is lively and fun, and my 15 month old daughter really enjoys it. However, the second episode is a lot less colorful and depicts stark scenes of a storm. My daughter has not watched this whole video, opting just to watch the first half and then fussing to have the second turned off."
1,Beware,"This book is dated (c.1975) sexist, racist and vulgar. Be warned if you are a woman, a person of color or have anything approaching a 21st century sensibility.Sample quote: ""bum - is what you sit on. Les femmes in New Zealand appear to have an unusually high proportion of broad ones and sturdy legs to match. Pioneer heritage?""Not my idea of amusing.If you want to find out about New Zealand, there are many websites that will give you a clearer idea of the place and the people than this book."
5,Very helpful...,"This is a wonderful, and insightful work. I am so pleased with this and all of David Hazard's books. Very rewarding, when reading and reflecting."
1,hablo mexican in brasilian music... totally destroyed the music,"i bought this music thinking that it is brasilian and the beautiful language of portuguese. instead, it is hablo mexican. spanish language is not pleasant to listen to and even the best brasilian music cannot conceal the bad part of it. i am very disappointed. the seller should explicitly list this is NOT portuguese and mexican."
4,really good book,This is a great read that was highly underestimated by the other reviewers. This book had all the steps and excercises to perfect invisibillity and levitation. I recommend this book to all of those who are interested.
3,The info is there if you know how to read it.,"Okay, I see all these doubting reviews of people. They probably thought that all the secrets would just be handed to them. What they don't know is that the information is there but incoded. Just like the Kabbalah and other magical text, the secrets are hidden to throw off the sorry losers who dont take the time to study and practice magic. Anyone who has a fundamental knowledge of magical operations can have success with this book."
1,This book lacks everything,"what a hoax, no wonder why this book uses big font and lots of spacing. It lacks information totally. no organization, just sacrilegious jargon not beyond the ordinary. I only found just a few pages on something interesting, and it was only on ancient pagan spirit worship. summary: not recommended"
1,Online references compiled in a book...,"Good book to read. If you don't believe in this stuff. Don't waste your time reading it. I knew the information in this book through researching. In this book, its all put together. Its there when you need it. All in one place. Good handbook to have, If you are interested in learing these things."
4,I'm still invisible,"While reading this book and working on the invisibility technique, my whole body began to flicker. Like a TV screen, flickering in and out. Then I went totally invisible, and I'm still invisible. And this is why I'm not rating this book with 5 stars. They don't explain well enough how to come back after going invisible. I mean, how am I supposed to live like this? It sounded great before I did it but now I don't know what I'm going to do."
1,Save your $ and spend it on a lesson,This is a poor instructional video. Not enough details on the fundamentals of golf and to much on the golf history of Tiger Wood and Butch's personal history. The short game tape has some worthwhile info but the other two tapes are 75% wothless when it comes to golf instruction.
5,"Love, love, love","I'm starting to really enjoy the NATURAL SOURCES concentrates. This one uses apple juice concentrate as a sweetener, containing 10g of sugar per serving (1 Tbsp), and there's 32 servings per pint. Really great taste. We love ours in kombucha, sparkling water, and my next use will be making a dinner dish with it. Love it."
2,Ludicrous assumptions,"This book is full of speculation (among other things) from cover to cover. The author is obsessed with the notion that Mae West was a man. This was written just after she passed away, and clearly Mr. Cashin wanted to ""cash-in"". Not recommended."
1,Don't waste your money,"Had to return it as the only way that this transmitter would activate the door bell was to stand about two feet away. It's a very inferior product that i would not recommend to my worst enemy. I returned it to Amazon and for less money my wife purchased a new wireless doorbells and push button from Walmart,"
1,"Useful Book, Incompatible Software","I purchased this book primarily for the software, which I thought would help save time completing the name change forms. I found the book to have useful information; however, the software was incompatible with the Windows 98 operating system on my computer. The publisher kindly provided another copy of the software upon request, unfortunately, that copy was also incompatible. As a result, my husband had to format my computer's hard drive and reinstall Windows 98 several times. If you do not have an interest in using the software, this book might be the one for you."
1,TERRIBLE,"What a waste of money. This game is a total disappointment. Poor design, cheap made, the characters are boring and the whole game is rather boring as well. But then again, MK3 never was a good game to begin with. STAY AWAY."
3,Where's Scorpion and Reptile (LOGO) SMK review,"This is a fun game but don't be fooled. In this game the only ninja you get is my favorite Sub Zero. Scorpion and Reptile are'nt even in this game. Neither is Johnny Cage,Kitana,or Baraka. This game has brought some new replacement's for them though. Like Kabal,Stryker,Sector,and Cyrax. Overall I wouldn't buy this MK game but would rent it.If you would like to know if I have any other reviews look for my logo which is SMK at the bottom or top of my review.OUT!(LOGO) SMK"
2,So Glad This One Is Over,"I really really disliked it and felt that it wasn't that funny and wasn't worth your time or money. I have read other reviews though just to be fair and I have found that more than a few others have really enjoyed this series so maybe I just don't have the right sense of humor for a series like this. Then again, maybe I'm right and everyone else is wrong. It really doesn't matter either way, does it?The point I'm trying to make is that ever since I put the first DVD of this series in, I've felt like my time has been wasted on watching it and I'm glad that I don't have to pick it up again. If you really want to give it try, rent or borrow any volume of this series (it really doesn't matter which one since none of them have anything to do with each other really except in a couple of very small instances) and see if it makes you laugh. It sure didn't make me laugh though."
5,Qwiksand Are Licensed To Chill,"While amusing, albeit simplistic lyrics at times, The Fellowship of the Groove starring vocalist Marlon Hawkins, drummer Mike Wagner, bassist T.J. Ferrugia and guitarist R~A~S combine the ska of Sublime, the funk of the Chili Peppers with the soul of Ben Harper. From one track to the next, these southern Californians dish up a strong plethora of musical styles ranging from rock, funk, reggae, blues, jazz. Whether you are a surfer, skater or funk junky, Qwiksand are licensed to chill.Pros: Strong four-piece. Album/Artwork are made with eco friendly recycled materials.Cons: A DVD would also be great for this live-based sound."
1,Do not blaspheme the sanctity of groove,"This is an amateur effort by a power trio with a singer. I bought this album after reading a positive review by a local periodical, and because ""groove"" is in the title. I was greatly disappointed. It is a testament to the subjectivity of the labels ""funk"" and ""groove"". It is bland electric guitar chord-based rock. It is hardly funky at all, only briefly in places. They blend ska, reggae, funk, and rock into a mediocre, generic composite that lacks the interesting qualities of any of those styles. Save your money, I wish someone would've told me the same. Check out Billy Cobham's ""Funky Thide Of Sings"" for high-blast hardcore funk, or The Greyboy Allstars' ""West Coast Boogaloo"" for smokin' cool jazz-funk grooves. Peace."
3,Love Harry - This DVD? - Not so much,"Sorry, it is just an old and tiredconcert with poor video, poor sound,and a dead audience that left and wentto see Have You Heard with Jim Croce andthey continued sleeping at that one.Sorry Harry."
5,I was there. This book is awesome.,I couldn't put it down. I've read many books on this campaign. This is the only one that brought back the memories so vividly that it was hard to read through tear-filled eyes. This is a literary experience to match the Saving Pvt.Ryan drama for the moviegoer. If this book is made into a movie it will far outdo Saving Pvt. Ryan. Martin Russ has done a very efficient job of bringing Chosin to life and giving the reader an emotional roller coaster ride through the 18 days of battle.
1,Fiction at its worse,"The inside cover of this book has a publisher's note stating ""This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places, and incidents are either the product of the author's imagination or are used fictitiously, and any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, business establishments, events, or locales is entirely coincidental.""Calling this book a work of fiction is demeaning good fiction. Seldom have I wasted [money] so foolishly. If the author actually believes the Marine propaganda that he spiels forth on the 436 pages of text, one cannot help but wonder if he contracted a little Manchurian Candidatis during his tour in Korea. I was hoping for history of Battle at the Chosin Reservoir. I got one ex-Marine's braggadocio."
3,Expected More,"Mr. Russ used all the appropriate quotes and dredged-up memories from the participants in this incredible story. It is the story and background between these quotes that is wanting. I would have enjoyed the book far more if there had been a number of detailed maps reflecting the situation as it changed daily, or even hourly."
4,Fine Book Would Benefit from Maps,"Martin Russ' liberal use of the words of the Chosin veterans gives this book an authenticity regarding individual combat that's hard to match. Russ also does a good job of keeping the reader abreast of the extremely fluid battle situation. His cause would have been aided immeasurably, however, had the publisher included detailed maps of the area and the action as it unfolded. (The three bare-bones maps that are included are of minimal help.) It's hard to understand why someone would publish a book about battle without including good maps, which are an integral part of battle while it's happening and as it is studied."
3,Funny and romantic!!,"I enjoyed reading Playing House, I picked it up mainly because the title of the book seemed of interest to me. In it, I laughed and sympathized with the characters as the events in it could very well happen to any of us. Easy reading and fun!!"
3,Fell short of being a great read,"As an avid reader, I found this book to be quite lacking for the most part. Where I loved Lester and some of Frannie's episodes, I felt that Calvin was lacking depth of character for the most part. I guess I might have been expecting something quite different from this book."
4,One fine ladder,I've been happy with the ladder. I was told it would only last 3 years when it was put in. I got about 5. Would've been more but someone wasn't careful putting it up and it tweaked.
4,Fun Road & Dancing Music,"These guys are from a town near me, San Angelo, Texas. Even if they weren't, I'd still like the CD. It has some really catchy tunes that are just plain fun to listen to and a blast to dance to. A couple of tracks are mildly forgettable, but the rest are good listening music. Very nice harmonies. Worth the money spent."
4,Los Lonely Boys are true rock 'n roll!!,"These guys are really what rock 'n roll is all about. They bring something unique, while remaining true to the influences of the past and their heritage. I hope that they stay around for a long time. I bought this CD on an impulse after having heard only ""Heaven"" on the radio, and I certainly do not regret it."
5,Heaven's Right Here on Earth,"I heard the group's first single, Heaven, on WFUV, Fordham University's radio station out of the Bronx, NY when the album was relased in August. It's the perfect song, you can't stand still...gotta move to it, I've been hooked since! Never heard of the group, but found their web site, read the reviews, and became an instant fan. This band of brothers from little San Angelo, Texas is poised for greatness. None of them is older than 25, but they've got what it takes. A little bit of Carlos Santana, a little bit of Stevie Ray Vaughn, a little bit of Tejano...it's all right here. Willie Nelson's one of their biggest fans, you will be too. A terrific debut album."
5,Great latin tinged rock album,"Now this is great music. I first heard LLB on XM Radio,and had to check out the whole album online via rhapsody. One listen,and I was buying this cd pretty soon after. The three Garza brothers are an incredibly tight band. Jojo and Ringo are tight as can be,and Henry is a very tasteful,talented guitar player,probably the best new guitarist to come along since Mato Nanji from Indigenous. Listening to this cd definatly brought indigenous to mind,and made we wish these two bands could hook up for some shows. That would be the show of the year. If you're into guitar based bluesy rock,with great harmonies,this would be a must listen."
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...,Los Lobos Lite!!! Pretenders! Fakes! Phonies! Wannabes! Yawn! Should go back under the rock where Willie Nelson found them!!!NEXT!!!
5,Interesting mix - but it completely works,Los Lonely Boys sound like Double Trouble (Stevie Ray and Jimmy Vaughn) if they were way into latin rythym. I think that is a great mix when they play their more bluesy songs. Some songs are on the edge of sappy-smooth-jazz though. Don't take that as a negative because I've already allotted my $25 to go see these guys at Willie Nelson's picnic in Ft. Worth... all this the day after the bought the CD.
1,This is just horrific...,yea it seems a little harsh... but i listened to it and it was so boring and sucky! this is a sad excuse for a band. do not buy this album unless its at the dollar store
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,"I have to agree w/the previous review that this is a poor combination of Dumb & Dumber meets the Godfather, but throw in a couple of dimwit blonds (which I really did expect better acting from) and it was a complete flop. There is nothing comedic about this story, the humor falls flat, and the only time I found myself laugh out loud was because the scene was so bad I couldn't help myself. I'm so glad I only paid $1.08 to rent this but I still feel like I wasted my money. So, unless you're a Pamela Anderson or Denise Richards fan (and again, I had high expectations for these two because I know they're not stupid women), then save your money."
4,"An excellent book, in a new and mind catching world!","I read this book in 2 days! It was an interesting view on a totally different world. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and was able to follow it very easily. Ms. Huff is a new writer to me and I was most favorably impressed with her storytelling ablilties!"
4,Great easel,I use both dry erase and the felt board daily in my pre-k class. This is perfect for me except for the magnetic book stand was slightly bent uppn arrival and I really wish the white board was magnetic too. Its a great size though so it works when sitting on the floor or on a chair.
5,Best doggone bargain on the market,"If you've ever thought about saving your dog's hair to eventually have something made out of it but didn't know where to start, or end, this booklet is for you. It's compact yet thorough, detailed and, best of all, easy to follow. Written by one of the nation's leading authorities on dog hair spinning, the simple, no-nonsense approach in this bargain-priced booklet is a refreshing alternative to big, expensive books."
4,Decent for the price ... at W**mart,"These are nice, decent garden shears that also withstand light pruning jobs. But I paid much less at a big box store."
5,Wife loves this necklace,My wife really likes this necklace and wears it daily. Would recommend for any mother.
4,reviewing passion lane,This was a very good movie I liked Amy Lindsay in this. Very good sex scenes. Worth the money. If you get a chance to buy it do so.
1,no snow leopard support & no plan to add,"Bought this a year ago and, while Amazon's description says this supports Mac OSx 10.4 and above, this does not work on Snow Leopard. I've talked to Peterson support, but they could only confirm that it's not Snow Leopard compatible. They also went on to say that there isn't a plan to add support because they have moved their resources towards developing their iPhone tuner. They couldn't actually offer me anything better than a discount on a hardware tuner that was used for demos. This was like throwing money away, with nothing to show. I'd love to hear if this works for Windows users.I gave it one star because the feature set, had it worked, looked very promising."
5,At The Copa...Copacabana!!!,"This book is a beautiful look at the night club era of pre-disco.When getting a table in a nightclub meant something. My heart is saddened that I came too late to see this era of true entertainment and deco design. It must have been magical. Some beautiful images, color graphics, and type from the era.Hardback is linen."
5,pretty nice,"I haven't had any trouble standing this up and don't find it cheap looking at all. I use it as decoration in my room and to hide my hamper and it has been great. Have had it for a year, light portable and pretty! It's true, the material they used is a little weird and I'm sure there might be something more fabulous out there but this is definitely better priced and better looking than stuff i've seen laying around at target walmart and similar stores."
1,Not usuable,Ordered this item as a Christmas gift. Returned it for a replacement as the first one was cracked along the top. The second one was also cracked from being folded. Husband was really disappointed.
4,The game continues...,"The game continues on and things are getting more intense both in and outside the game. More unwitting players join the crew of un-dead alien hunters and the aliens keep getting bigger and nastier. Truely this show is incredible in that it never gets dull, with every episode you are hooked to see the next. A word of warning though for those who feel the nudity is a bit gratuitous...this volume adds a new flavor to the bloody mayhem: sex, really intense sex. So be warned, this show is not rated M for nothing. Even so, the show still kicks *** and I have not been disappointed in the series yet. Who will survive? Who will die? Who will fight? Only Gantz knows."
1,Archilles Heel - the spring--,"if you use these occasionally, fine - but we used in a small commercial greenhouse - they are *great* shears for light trimming...HOWEVER BE FOREWARNED -A) THE SPRING SUCKS - RUSTS IN A MATTER OF WEEKS IN A DAMP GREENHOUSE AND DROPS OFFB) CUSTOMER SERVICE ""LIMITED WARRANTY"" IS A JOKE -$10 for a couple months is waaaay outta line -translation of ""Limited Warranty"" = Limited to the short lifespan of the lousy little super-fast rusting spring...(happened on 3 pair...)"
4,Fiskers micro-tip pruning snip,I very much like the pointed tips of this shear. Works great for getting thru mass of leaves/branches to get at the item you want to cut away. One snip and off it is. I am very careful to keep it safely away from inquisitive grandchildren!
1,Not What I Had Imagined!,"It is not sharp. I have a hard time clipping small branches. The worst part is that I have hurt myself, where my fingers have been caught in the closing area. On the other hand, it is hard to close. I would have preferred that it did not close, and just came in a protect cover. However, it has to close to fit in the protective cover. In hindsight, I should have purchased a heavier duty pruner."
3,"It worked for a while, but the tip is too sharp, and it no longer works at all","We have another very similar snipper that works about the same, but has a safer tip to the blades. We mainly use them for cutting off blooms and old scapes from daylilies and similar light tasks. The main difference is that the Fiskars pruner has a very sharp tip. That makes it easy to cut yourself inadvertently, especially if you are old enoght to have relatively thin skin. It is probably why it comes with the plastic tip guard. It would be improved if Fiskars would make the tip more blunt--I don't know of any reason why it should be sharp. I took a file and made the tip less sharp, but the metal is hard, and that was not easy to do.After I used this snipper for a few months the spring came out, and it is about useless now as the spring won't stay put. I would give it a one star if I could change the rating."
3,Lightweight tool for light jobs,"This snip tool is ok for very light jobs (e.g. flower arranging, small houseplants, etc.) It is just too flimsy for cutting wire, cardboard, or what I purchased it for- tennis racquet string. For that, you need to go up to the Fiskars Multi-Snip or similar middleweight cutting tool. I did like the spring tension, which is fine for repetitive cutting action."
2,flimsy,The orange plastic locking clip falls off! Consider a regular scissor instead. Or save up for a Corona or Felco.
2,Very disappointing,"If you're a true foot/leg fan and you enjoyed the printed Barefoot Beauties photo books you'll be very disapointed by this DVD. The girls are beautiful and most have very attractive feet/toes, but the scenes are 80% ..., faces & torsos.Amazingly in many scenes during a closeup they cut the off half the foot or entirely from the ankle down. Many scenes they do a long pan down the leg and as soon as they get to the foot they do a quick blur past it.It's obvious they didn't shoot the scenes specifically for this title, but rather rounded up existing footage that showed a little more leg/feet/toes than normal (which for Playboy is minimal anyway). I've seen more feet/toes in their regular videos like the first Girlfriends.Playboy had a great opportunity here but they only understand their mainstream market. They've always had trouble with niche and fetish fans."
1,A book of poetry that's 'good for you...' like cooked spinach to be choked down...,"Note to the editors: Difficult does not equal good.These poems may be 'great' but enjoyable they are not. It's poetry few would read by choice. Had I known this was a book of 'difficult' poems by former slaves, insurance salesmen and other literary giants I would have avoided it.Poetry can be both great and accessible to those of us without access to post grad English seminars to decode it.And an anthology should be assembled without regard to who wrote it. This one seems to be weighted to those poets of whom the editors approve."
5,Quality product...,As advertised and fit my needs 100%. This was just what I was looking for. I can recommend this product.
1,Cracked with first use.,I was so excited when receiving my tea pot. I followed the directions for the tea flower as far as temperature of the water and length of steeping time. I pulled the flower out of the pot and set it aside. I picked up the pot by the handle and heard a funny noise. I looked and saw a two inch long crack right at where the top of the handle meets the pot. Really disappointing.
1,Oh Dear !,"I received this as a gift and thought it looked like a lovely idea. I opened the box and unwrapped the glass pieces. There were supposed to be 3 pieces: (i) a teapot (ii) a lid and (iii) an infuser. Unfortunately I had more, only the tea pot lid was in one piece. OK that may be a shipping issue BUT my 12 pack of Flowering Teas had an expiration date of 12/30/2010 ! What a disappointment."
1,Bad quality tea pot,It's bad quality Tea pot. The tea pot's cover broke from the first use. I'm really upset because of that.
3,Rider beware!,"On a recent trip to Moab a friend and I relied on this book for directions. We tried four of the rides. The directions are not always clear, although three of the four rides were on trails that were either well-marked or obvious. But Crowell's directions for the ""Courthouse Wash"" route were indecipherable; we spent several hours trying to find our way with little success. So I wouldn't rely on this book alone. I also noticed that the bike shops in Moab carried several trail guides, but not this one."
5,Singularity Theory and Gravitational Lensing by Petters,The book addresses the subject on two levels. The first part of the book is oriented toward physicists and the second half toward mathematicians. I think this is excellent.
2,Don't go there,"I didn't feel like a dummy until I tried to use this guide. My husband and I are good at following maps and directions and this guide has neither. Some of the maps are incorrect as are the directions..you can't get there following the directions, believe me we tried. Makes us wonder if anyone actually went to the places in the book or just gave directions off of a map. Also if the guide has anyone that actually tries to follow the directions before the printing to see if us 'dummies' can actually follow them."
5,fiskars 9333 15 inch replacement saw blade,"The fiskars replacement saw blade arrived as described, on time and fit my pole pruner perfectly. I would buy it again."
4,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,"However, beware of downloaded versions of software. After 2 downloads, it is difficult to reinstall software again. Would recommend getting a CD as oppose to downloading. I had to reformat my HD and am having trouble reinstalling software again."
5,"Best Anti Virus, Best Virus Detector in the World",I will say that this is the best Virus Detector of the world
2,One big problem,"If you see the Firewalls and study all of that you can see all of that have some vulnerability well i like to use Black Ice i thik is a good product easy to use and give to you some security but this is the big problem wen i use the Black Ice with Norton AV the things become ugly and norton crash or simple stop detecting viruses, well wen i try tu unistall some of theme (Black Ice or Norton AV) the problem is the uninstall shill can't do that, well i have to erase manually and edit the regestry of my WinXP to fix the problem, if you use the WinXP firewall or the symantec Firewall use the norton AV but if you use other firewall think better if you want to buy this product"
2,Renewing Anti_Virus Subscriptions,"The virus protection updates come regularly and are easy to download and install, but watch out for when the subscription isgoing to run out and it is time to renew. The idiodic softwarewants a subscription key before it will take your money. What the Hell is a key? I don't have one. Oh, I have to call ONETOLL NUMBER in the United States, pay for the call, and onlyduring regular business hours.NO THANKS - not again."
2,Beware 2002 does not support NT Servers,Total waste of money looking at the requirements 95/98/NT/2000/XP well the NT is work station only so beware if ordering this product for NT Server. Also only one year subscription when purchasing this product.
4,Birds love them,"The birds love these! Doesn't matter what ""flavor"" I buy, they love them. There is very little mess, and very little waste. And for the money, this couldn't be a better deal. I would recommend using Nutri-Berries as a diet supplement or a treat, as too much of a good thing can be bad (it isn't good for parrots as a main diet substance according to some research)."
5,My six year old begged to read more.,"I don't write reviews very often, but I felt I needed to with this book. My son is beginning first grade this year, and is reading short words, but he doesn't like to sit very long. It is a struggle to get him through more than one book a day. However, with this set I can usually get him to read through at least two stories. And today, when he discovered the stickers he could earn for reading, he read every book in the set. I was amazed! Fun stories with fun pictures. (I also like Bob books - but he likes these better:)"
4,Works well enough that we bought another one,"One downstairs dimming 6 can lights, another upstairs in the nursery dimming ceiling fan lights. Easy enough to install but might be a tight fit for some boxes."
5,A winner for sure...,"Love it. Yeah...an 8 pound maul is going to do better on some rounds, but swing this thing for 5 hours and you won't be in traction the next day. I went through about a cord and a half in that time, but I spent a lot of that time forming a drying pile because the wood is only barely semi seasoned at best. And I have to say...that some rounds that have knots or other causes for difficulty in splitting were susceptible to splitting from the side because this thing is just so sharp when normally a maul even a heavy one would not make any headway.Lastly, like others...I over swung a couple of times and really was super impressed with how little damage it made to the neck...close to no signs at all...I say thing because I did eventually destruct my 'indestructible' 8 pound maul as a result of such over swings.Highly recommend."
5,super duper splitter,I have been using a 8lb splitting maul for small splitting jobs when I did not want to break out the sears 27 ton gas powered splitting machine. I have also been using the 8 pounder to split ponderosa pine at my cabin. It works but sometimes requires a lot of whacks especially with some of the pine. I have an older fiskars ax which I love. I used that ax for splitting kindling and trimming low branches on trees at cabin. This X27 is the bomb. It takes much less effort and splits more effectively then my 8lb maul. I could split for a much longer period of time between rest periods with this splitter too. I am 6ft and the x27 handle is just right for me. It is very sharp so watch your toes.
3,Won't Replace the Monster Maul,"This splitting axe is good for the smaller easier stuff, and my wife can handle it (bonus!), but for the larger, knottier pieces, it doesn't work like my beloved Sotz Monster Maul (or wedges).The Fiskars is easy to swing, and has a long handle (I need it!), but like a regular axe, and despite the slick coating on the head, it gets stuck easy, too.All in all, okay, but don't throw out your maul and wedges."
3,"Good, but not tough enough",Broke the handle in about 2 days. But before it broke it worked great splitting almost a full cord of wood. Amazon replaced it and the new axe has worked great.
5,one awesome axe,"They claim it's a ""one strike split"" axe, well they're not far off. I'm about as bad a wood splitter as you're gonna find and this axe makes even me look good. Even powers through pine logs with 2"" knots running the full diameter of the log, though understandably not in one strike. My dad (who used to split logs by hand for his wood stove for years) would tell me to give up because there isn't an axe alive that can get through some of those knots. Well this one did and it impressed him (though I won't lie I was feeling it the next day, but it was worth it to impress my dad). I read the reviews for the shorter axes and didn't want to mess around with em, just went straight for the 36"" one and don't regret it. I'd recommend this axe to anyone needing to split logs."
4,"Good, light weight maul!","For smaller logs - it splits them like peas! Nor do you have to be ""lumberjack"" size to swing this axe. You'll need something a little more substantial for bigger pieces of wood, but this works real well on smaller to medium logs. Enjoy the exercise!!"
3,Good but not great,"This won't ever replace an 8lb maul for bigger stuff, but it works for medium to small. Somebody said it would split wet oak with no problem, I say not a chance. Just not enough weight behind it. I'm definitely keeping it because once the 8lb has split up the big logs this one will finish the pieces with less than half the weight."
5,awesome wood busting axe,"Can't ask for much more - great balance, head shape really gets thru the work.Very durable - should last a long time. easy to keep an edge on the blade.love it and use it for as much of the work as i can."
5,Feels good for a camping splitter,"We went camping this last weekend and found this axe was perfect for splitting up seasoned camp wood. The weight feels just right for car camping, and yet the handle is longer than your typical camp axe. It's not going to work well for chopping down trees, for that you need a different blade. But this one is GREAT for splitting logs that are already cut, but not the right size or shape for your fire.The only thing I don't like so much is the case is really made for hanging on the wall, not for throwing in a box to go camping. But this is such a minor issue it doesn't detract from the product."
5,Cant recommend it enough,"This splitter was recommended to me by some one else and this is my first year splitting alot of wood. I had considered purchasing a hydraulic splitter until using this splitting axe. In the last 2 months I have split near 18 face cords of ash, hickory and oak all by hand - only another 7 to go! This axe is so easy to use and my 8# maul hasn't left the garage - this one does it all. Super sharp, easy to swing and doesnt tire me out."
4,Expectations too high,"Reading all of the reviews, I was expecting a miracle axe.Either the wood I am using is much harder (hickory and pecan) than other reviewers or I am very weak. The axe was bouncing off of the end of the wood when I was trying to split it.I am using this to re-split wood that I use in my smoker. So it is wood that has been already split and seasoned.The edge was sharp, but not as sharp as I expected, so I touched it up using a slack belt sander to give it a convex edge which now bites into the wood better.All things considered, it is a very good axe and I am glad I purchased it. It is much better than others I have tested."
3,axe me once,"Using the x25 /28 inch fisker for a year,and it works well.After hurricane Irene I split 4 cords of locust.Started to get pain in my wrists.Right at the muscle of the thumb.Wonder if any one is feeling the same effect.Fiskers reported no problems. When using a splitting log under your to split piece,I put a 3/4 inch plywd under my splitting log to catch my fisker axe in case of miss hit. sign out :Plassmagas"
5,great splitting axe!,"this axe performed great! i split a 22"" diameter log with this axe, in only 15 minutes. I'm only 14. if a 14 year old can split a 22"" log, anyone can. Very satisfied with this axe. It is worth the money."
5,The best,I have a number of axes for chopping wood which I have been using for years. I recently purchased aFiskar and it is THE BEST splitting axe I have ever used. Just make sure the edge stays sharp. Don't waste your money on any other axe.
5,Hugo Award winners worth the read,"I read this many years ago and many of the short stories still stay with me. It has stories by many of early Sci-Fi heavyweights: Phillip Farmer, Harlen Ellison, Ursula LeGuin, and Asimov. If you like the genre. Give it a read, then pass it on (I donated my copy to the library). It's a classic!"
5,Spongebob is the man!!,"Spongebob is an icon! Spongebob and Patrick, what a combination!!You cant go wrong with Spongebob!"
5,Goldie Locks Bag,"Not a hard case, not a soft case, it is the perfect mix between the two...just right. I love the padded shoulder strap and the two ammo compartments inside the bag. Also of note, the zippers have holes to put a lock through which is nice for added safety."
5,best guide,"this pokemon xd book help me beat the gamein only 9 days this book tells you everythingmt battle info, the complete pokedex,what pokemonare shadow and witch ones are not,and alot moreso if you look at my review by the book fromnintendo power."
1,use calipers and just buy a normal scale,I purchased this device understanding the level of error in measuring body fat %'s via electronic signals. I did not think that the fluctations could be from 9% to 18% body fat during the day. I think I could visually look at myself and make a better guess. So save your money and just order a normal scale.Darrin
4,The Premature Burial,Close to what I remembered when I saw it at the theatre in 1962! I was ten at that time. Loved seeing it again. I rememmbered the music FULLY.
5,Roger Corman's best,"Price and Corman were a wonderful working duo. And Corman's love for Poe's work shows. The Masque of The Red Death I think is one of Corman's best works, and is very artistic. Although I missed seeing Price in The Premature Burial, I was still enraptured with Milland's doomed character Guy, and worked very well in the role. An excellent gothic horror movie double feature worth seeing!"
4,"Fun, light reading.","The kind of book you keep handy when you have a few minutes here and there to fill, and want to catch yourself off-guard with some nugget of hidden insight and wisdom for your ride."
5,Lightweight and Powerful,We have a lot of pine trees in our backyard and this lopper does the magic. We use it to cut other branches as well from rose bushes to fruit trees. The best part is that the lopper is very lightweight which makes it easy for us to handle. We couldn't be happier with our purchase.
1,it broke,"I bought one of these at Home Depot. I used it clearing brush for about 2 hours and then the handle broke. The design seems good, but the quality is bad."
1,Would Pay More for Quality,"These cut branches pretty well. On a larger branch that was about 3"", I did manage to break one of the handles. I had an old Craftsman lopper that managed to cut 3""+ branches and didn't snap the handle."
4,"Fiskars 32"" Bypass Loppers","These Loppers cut just fine, if you've got enough wing span to open them far enough to get them around the limb you want to cut. I have average length arms for my 5'8"" frame & it's takes ever inch of them to open the 32"" Bypass Loppers enough to get them around a 2"" limb, & then it's a little awkward to close them to make the cut. They do cut through a 2"" limb with little effort. The handles aren't round, they are oval shaped & take a little getting used to."
4,Tree Loppers,I haven't had a chance to really trim one of my trees yet but I did try these loppers on some rather thick branches and I was very satisfied with their performance.
5,Cantilever design is the best,My new favorite lopping shears will cut down small trees!! Did some volunteer work cleaning up an old grave yard. Everybody was fighting over who got to use the Fiskars lopping shears!!! Big hit.
4,"A good value, May not be the toughest tool though.",These loppers work real well and perform as described. I was a little disappointed that they don't appear as tough as some others I have seen. The cutters and gears are stamped out of one piece and the handles don't appear to be attached that well. All that said they haven't broken yet and they are easy to use. The gear design makes it so you have to have pretty long arms to get the blades to open the full width. If you can get them on the branch though it's coming down no question about it.
5,Fiskars 9154 PowerGear Lopper,"These are absolutely the best pair of loppers I've ever owned. The ease of cutting, even at awkward angles, is amazing. The gear design, coupled with the tool's light weight, makes the loppers a joy to use. You'd expect to pay double or triple the actual cost for these loppers and they'd be worth it. I've purchased three more pair for friends who were as impressed as I was when they gave the loppers a try. I can't recommend the 9154 PowerGear 31 1/2"" lopper highly enough."
4,Best Lopper I've ever used,"I purchased this at Home Depot. It can cut 2"" or even 2.5"" branches with relative ease. But there is one issue. The cutting blade broke at some point. I didn't notice it until I had problems getting the cut to go all the way through. However, I went to the Fiskars website [...] and found out the live chat button and explained the issue to the customer rep. She sent a new one out that day and I received it in 3 business days. Installing the new blade was very easy and it worked just great.Over all, this lopper is a joy to use. The movement is smooth and the cuts are clean.I wonder if Amazon will ever sell the replacement blade, though."
4,Friskars PowerGear makes the cut,"There was an area of my front garden in which unwanted saplings came up yearly, growing to 1 1/2"" stem thickness and becomming unsightly. These took them all down with little trouble. As mentioned by others, on the big shoots or branches you have to really open these wide and get real close, but that's how the get the leverage from the huge gearing on the front behind the blade. Just what I wanted. A lot less trouble than getting out a saw or other type of clipper where you have to use too much muscle power. Good for a woman especially since it doesn't require much upper limb strength (human limbs, that is). Now I feel secure there will never be a small limb or sapling I can't handle. Junk bushes, beware!"
3,"Good idea, but fragile.","Somehow I really like these loppers, they're lightweight and the simple mechanical action is awesome. Sadly, the blade got badly chipped on the first day of use, cutting a 2"" branch. Can't find replacement blades on amazon, so that's that."
3,it looks good though,it looks like a well made high quality piece of equipment. brand new right out of the box both handles fell off. i guess i can glue them back on but this is a brand new tool under warranty.update: i glued the two handles onto the metal arms. it works great. it is very powerful. i like it. it has enough leverage that it can do the big jobs easily.
1,Don't waste your time or money,"THESE ARE PLASTIC ... NOT GLASSListing ambiguous and misleading. ""No chips or cracks"" is used to discribe GLASS NOT PLASTIC!!! Save your money!!!!!!!!!! Run the opposite direction!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Really Helpful,"This compactible 10 gallon container is lightweight, and easily fits between plants when grooming the garden. I wish that Fiskars would put a plastic bottom on this size just like they do on the larger one. This is our third 10 gallon Kangaroo and we love them."
5,"Gardening popup tub, small, collapsible, versatile, handy","Bought this even though I didn't know I needed it. Perfect for weeding small flower, vegetable patches.Collapsible springform for easy nearly flat storage. Fits nicely inside the Kangaroo 30 gallon popup, collapsible springform container, too, either upright or folded down using toggles and loops on 2 sides.10 gallon needs no plastic bag, easy to turn weeds into a large bag later."
1,Not a happy camper,"Although the service regarding shipping with this item was great, in the long-run I was not at all happy with this chain. I wore it a time or 2 within a few months of receiving it and it wore fine.. Then, when it was stored (flat, to hold the shape) it started 'curling' in on itself and no matter what I did I could not get it to regain the shape it was supposed to have. It became completely unusable after a few months."
3,Good video,She is very easy to relate to and breaks down the components of each step/section in a nice way. Good basics...
5,Just look at the evolutionists squeal!,"Based on my experience with the work of Answers in Genesis, I bought this book to help innoculate my children against the indoctrination of the public schools. I have not been disappointed and highly recommend this book to all other parents who are concerned that their children know the truth.The vituperative reviews of the evolutionists bolstered me in my selection of this book, because if they get so riled that they squeal like stuck pigs, then it must be really good!I want to thank the evolutionists further for the entertaining fashion in which they show their lack of critical thought ..."
4,Skeletons in the closet,This is a very good book for children and adults. It tells how this earth was evolved. Its not evolution. All parents should let there children read this book. It answers a lot of questions.
1,Not worth the investment,"I had mine less than a week and the motor burned out (bought on Monday & it died on Saturday). I was only making 2 glasses of juice a day. Also, the feeder is small, about 1 in by 2.5 in so fruits & veggies need to be cut up first which can reduce the amount of juice produced. I found clean up was fairly easy although it seemed like the pulp made a bigger mess than it should have. I wanted a cheaper one to start with to see how well I liked juicing before making a more significant purchase. However, I expected it to last a few months, not a few days. Lesson learned. I'd skip this product and invest your money in something with a larger, better made motor. I replaced this with a Juiceman, Jr with an 800 watt motor and I'm getting a LOT more juice and a lot less pulp than I was from this cheesy Black & Decker model."
2,Extremely Messy!!!!!,Juices well but extremely messy. Five minutes of juicing = twenty minutes of cleaning. Juice leaks all over the place and the mesh is extremely hard to clean. I put mine in the donation pile after three uses.
5,Works great with Fizz Giz Soda Maker.,"I purchased these to use with the Fiss Giz Soda Maker. The Fizz Giz instructions had called for Pepsi bottles, which didn't work for me. It was a good move since the Fizz Giz caps worked perfect on these bottles."
5,very pleased,I was very pleased with this product . The price was very reasonable and the product arrived before the date that I was told .
5,Has something for everyone,"In addition to being well organized and well written, this book does an outstanding job of breaking a complex subject down into understandable pieces. Whether you are new to web analytics or have been using a web analytics tool for years, you will learn something from this book.I highly recommend this book."
4,the best system,very very good Microsystem. very good sound for a small system. love the design. only 4 stars for the high price. don't be stingy go for it
5,Comfortable and clean sound,"These are the best set of headphones I have come across. I have tried probably 5-10 different kinds from brands ranging from Sony, Bose, Koss, etc...These will give you comfortable listening and top notch sound for hours. I have owned these for over a year now and the only downside I see is that you need to clean the earpads or else they will get dirty. However these are easily removable too. Having an optional shorter cord (comes with 10 ft by default) would also be nice."
5,Always satisfying to buy a D2 album,I'm sure it sounds better than the previous CD release but one would have to listen closely to notice. The gatefold cardboard sleeve with a booklet in one side and an inner-sleeved CD in the other side is brilliant. More room for artwork and much nicer to hold than a plastic case. This is how all CD's should have been packaged from the start. The booklet has lyrics and a different Nagel picture that I believe only saw the light of day previously as the cover for the Japanese Rio 7-inch. Enhanced CD features are always a plus.
1,The worst coffee maker !,"Several years ago I had a space saver with a glass carafe that made a decent cup of joe and lasted for years ,so My husband bought this for me a few weeks ago when my cuisanart grind and brew died during the holidays and company was due to arrive . It is awful ! Mine leaked ,the coffee tasted like burnt plastic and took forever to pour into the cup because of the ridiculously inept design of the ( so called ) ""thermal"" carafe . I returned this piece of junk ASAP .Heed these reviews and dont buy this really awful coffee maker !"
1,Horrible carafe design,"It is just about impossible to pour coffee in your cup without spilling all over the counter! We've had this model for four months and are ready to chuck it out the window. Because the carafe is insulated and thus, keeps the coffee warm, we can't just go out an get a different style of carafe.Also--the water holder leaks so we can't make coffee the night before.Terrible design--apparently no one actually used this product before releasing it to consumers."
3,Black and decker under couter/carafe,the coffee is good...the concept is good. the problems are that the top leaks when you unscrew it to pour ...so if you don't mind losing half a cup of coffee or so its not a bad buy.
1,the WORST!,"The carafe doesnt keep the coffee hot, it doesnt even START OUT hot enough. You cannot pour coffee without dribbling all over the counter unless you take the cover all the way off and then it is difficult to rethread correctly to put it back on. So pouring a cup of coffee is irritating and time consuming. This is te worst black and decker product I ever owned."
1,Trashy product,"Hopefully someone will research the product before buying it. I didn't. I went with the notion of "" I've bought B+D products before with no problem"". This time it was different. I can't believe they would even put such a crummy product on the market. The lid leaks, coffee does not stay hot enough, hard to clean inside pot, hot steam ruins cabinet above maker,does not empty water after about 2 months, ( takes 3 pushes of start button to make a pot of coffee )coffee pours way to slow from carafe.Another product from China that's not worth what you pay for it. Now I'll switch to another manufacturer for all my products. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!"
1,wish I'd read the reviews first,"The coffee starts out lukewarm and quickly becomes tepid.For a ""spacemaker,"" it takes up a lot of room.It only makes 10 cups.Our old Black & Decker ""spacemaker"" coffeemaker, which lasted 8 years, took up less room and made 12 cups.The pouring spout is poorly designed; it takes forever to pour a cup of coffee. If you hold it wrong, the coffee comes out the drip hole in the lid. Not pretty.On the water reservoir, there are measurement marks only on one side. When I hold it in my right hand to fill it in the sink, I can't see how full it is.The clock display is very hard to read.The one star is because that's the minimum you can enter, and because this thing does, in fact, make coffee. Warm coffee, not hot. But coffee nonetheless. I'm glad at least that I have a microwave oven, so I can pour myself a freshly brewed cup of coffee and then heat it up."
1,"I rate this minus stars, it should be a choice","This is my third black and decker spacemaker and if I had seen the reviews, I never would have bought it. My husband thought he was doing me a favor buying this after he broke the glass pot. I echo all the complaints listed in the following reviews primarily lukewarm coffee and an impossible to screw on top. I'm frantically trying to find a store with an old style spacemaker left in the back room, this is the replacement for the old style. I don't think anyone involved in the design and production of this coffee maker tried making coffee in it."
5,Excellent resource for pet names,"If you work at a shelter or any type of animal rescue group, you know how difficult it is to think of names for the abundance of animals that come in to your facility. ""1000 Dog Names from A to Z"" is an excellent resource to make naming a bit easier. Couldn't ask for a better resource at your fingertips!"
5,Great oven...horrible instructions,"This oven will do everything it is supposed to do quickly and easily. The controls are clear and simple...as long as you don't read the ""Quick Start Guide"" or the Instruction Manual. For instance, the Guide says: ""To turn on the fan for convection cooking, press BAKE, BAKE, and BAKE."" Duh! It doesn't work that way. The manual is equally weird. Step 3 under BAKING reads: Important: You have only 5 seconds to press START or START, If you do not press START or START, the digital display..."" They need an editor who speaks English!"
1,Don't do it !,"I just had to have this toaster oven and it's absolutely awful! The digital controls are a huge pain, the timer is, frankly, quite time consuming to set. I thought the adjustable (maybe mutiple shelves) would be great but they don't work well at all. The worst part is that the outside gets incredibly hot!!!! I tend to use a toaster oven exclusively during the summer to cut down on the heat and this totally defeated the purpose. I'll stick with the cooler, simpler knob toaster oven."
1,"For the price of a textbook, a long magazine article...","...and, an entirely unremarkable one, at that. The ""psychology"" of day trading is reduced to a few off-the-cuff paragraphs that remind this reader of Ulysses-like stream of consciousness. Regretably, Michael P. Turner is is not James Joyce, Wall Street is not in Dublin, and I'm amazed that I spent $60+ on this book, the erstwhile ""bible"" of Day Trading. ""Thou Shalt Not Steal"" is the only commandment conveyed by DTITM, to me."
2,"very basic - as in ""only for novices""","not much more that i can say except... if you are a novice trader this is a good book, otherwise, save your money. period!"
3,Just ok headphones,Frequency Response is narrow and the total harmonic distortion is too high (~1%). I am not an audiophile but this headphone is too flat for my taste. Hence the just average rating. One can adjust the headphones to fit (u just have to pull down on the speakers down or up) and I found these headphones comfortable.
2,Hit the mute button,"The Fear Factor Gals are great looking nekkid- but the narrotor is the most annoying voice they could have possibly found. A female narrator may have been better, but there's something pretty un-sexy about a narrator who sounds like a game show host talking over images of naked girls."
1,To all,"The product was very small and bendable and not what it looks like online when it in your own hands, but i guess for the price i paid that what you get. Another thing is the shipping was very poor i complained maybe twice before i got my package a month later, after that time i no longer needed it. In a nutshell bad experience."
4,Fun Kids game,"I couldn't get into it, it's not like Mega Man Legends or any of the X's. It's more like Mega Man for the new younger generation. Perfect for kids Moms!"
1,Disappointed!,"These headphones have possibly the worst sound I have ever heard. I have set of Realistic Nova 20(radio shack) headphones that are over 25 years old that sound a whole lot better. And those were more towards the bottom end of their price line back then. I also have a set of phones that came with my sony walkman that are better. (and these are cheapies.) One problem is the bass on these HD-570 totally gives out when you turn up the volume.( and that's not much volume.) And when you adjust the bass down all you have is a tinny sound with no character. I am using these headphones through a very good home receiver with a separate bass,mid, treble control knobs. I know how music should sound and these definitively don't deliver.*****(Buy the Sony MDR-CD780 headphones, these have the sound you are looking for. I have just got a pair! They totality blow away the Sennheiser HD570 on sound and are just as comfortable. And the price is right,..."
5,Excellent sound...,"I purchased these headphones based on the Sennheiser reputation. All i have to say is, ""Sennheiser has exceeded their reputation!"" These headphones are incredible.I listen to all kinds of music and I put these headphones to the test. Despite the ""Symphony"" in the name, they sound great for any music from classical to acid jazz to hip hop to techno.Are you a gamer? If so, you can hear details that you wouldn't be able to hear with other headphones. Footsteps??? Creaks??? etc...These are a great deal. It's worth the extra $$$ if you weren't looking to spend over $100 and worth saving the extra $$$ if you planning on spending over $200. Give them a shot!"
4,Excellent collection of modern metal,"I happened upon this double album at the CD store in the mall. After listening to WSOU for 5 years or so, I recognized almost all of the names on the track list.... I couldn't resist. There's a lot more remixes on here than I would care for, especially Fear Factory's Edgecrusher remix - it's awful. There are plenty of album version tracks on here with some excellent cuts from P.O.D., Grip Inc., and Nothingface. I don't know why they put that old-school Megadeth song on here, it doesn't fit in. All in all, a pretty good collection of talented, modern metal acts."
3,Sometimes it's Good,"This books showed a lot of possibilities. It had an interesting characters and the world it created was similar to reality, but it was it's own reality. The mistakes were in the tightness of the story, and the pacing."
3,Disappointing...,"This book had so many good reviews,I really thought I would enjoy it. I guess I missed what everyone else saw in this book. It was really nothing special. Not bad. Not great. The premise was interesting, and I was definitely rooting for Firmin, but I just never got deeply involved enough with him to really care. There were some high moments, but not enough unfortunately. I had a difficult time reading more than a few pages each night before bed, and while I should have been able to read a short book like this in a couple of days, it took me considerably longer. Again, maybe I missed the ""genius"" here. Better luck to future readers..."
4,"""Easy read........ I couldn't put it down.""","After reading The Secret to ""I Am"", I have realized we all have the same power to face challenges head on. Acting on ""common sense"" judgment and taking the time to truly listen to challenges can bring out everyone's ""own"" intuition. I applaud Susan for telling her story with such passion and drive and letting us all experience her journey. The book provides an easy step by step thought process to develop your own intuition.I would recommend reading it!"
2,Disappointing,"I had a pair of Sennheisers back in the 70's which were outstanding. So, when I needed to get some headphones to upgrade my old Walkman headphones, I assumed Sennheisers would be a sure bet. How wrong I was. While the bass was an improvement over my old phones, the mids and highs were a big disappointment, sounding muted, cloudy and just plain bad. The other sad news is that they aren't very comfortable. They squeeze my ears with a little too much force. I actually prefer using the ...headphones that came with the Walkman because at least the highs can be heard and they are comfortable to wear.Alas, my quest for lightweight, slim headphones with great sound continues..."
3,Starts out with good basics but geared to ATP types,I really liked how he started this book but found that as it went on I was wanting for more detail as it relates to privte pilots and not air traffic types Generaly a good book for first time instrument types
4,Cobalt blue is darker than shown,"Attractive, heavy glasses, but I'm a little disappointed that the colbalt blue doesn't look transparent unless I hold it up to a light source. They usually appear as a solid, navy color. And since I like the transparent look, I'd probably order a lighter color, had I to do it over."
3,Patience needed,"This is not exactly a ""toy"". More for older kids and adults.It was fun putting it together, mine wasn't as good as the orgiginal but workable. Took me too long to build so I am hestitant taking it out into the wind."
4,Textbook,We are currently using this book as a text at Gillette campus - NWCCD. It is the only book that uses Access and Visual Basic to do database programming. It is easy to follow and provides the students with the database applications and programming application that we need for future database development and maintenance.
4,"Cinematic Orchestra, The - All That You Give","All That You Give, the first single off the mind-blowing album Everyday, promises much -- namely two remixes by Herbert (with one done by his alter ego Dr. Rockit). The Herbert mix, however, isn't that strong: it chops up the original, but doesn't rearrange the part into something interesting. The Dr. Rockit mix more intriguing, but it's difficult to put a happy spin on such a deeply sad original. Instead, go to ""Kalimba,"" a piece that starts off as a wild free-jazz type until it adds the trademark Cinematic Orchestra chords halfway through. The original (with mighty vocals by the peerless Fontella Bass) needs no comment -- it really is that good."
4,The epic,This is the first time I've chosen to review an item and I have been an amazon customer for years. These speakers really made it possible to at least make a dent in my friends loud ass house speakers in my dorm. I cna finally hear my music/ video/ tv (this requires some extra adapters put totally worth the trouble). Simpley said the speakers with the itunes equalizer can give u a crisp fresh sound and can really be felt with the powerful little subwoofer. ITs an amazingly low cost highly efficent set =) buy and enjoy.
3,Good and bad,"Great sound and loud enough to jam to your fav song(s) at high volumes, buuut this product will randomly stop working after a few months. Its a cheap product."
3,Not bad for the price,Speakers are flimsy. They sure know how to blow up image to make something so small look big. Speakers should have been a little bigger than they are.
2,Too small,"The map is inexpensive, so I guess you get what you pay for. The individual states are difficult to see. Forget the cities."
1,This book is not about teaching only love.,"As I stated in the title, this book is not about teaching only love; it is a knock off version of ""A Course in Miracles"", which is chock full of anti-Christian gobblygook, but it is very well hidden. It's just someone else say they have a better way; total nonsense."
4,Lots of monkey fun,"Two fun monkeys, Chimp and Zee, make another appearance in the Anholt's popular series. Chimp and Zee ""monkey around"" in this brightly illustrated board book, and encourage young readers to join in. The simple rhyming text prompts children to interact on each page, asking them if they would ""like a little lick"" of a large purple popsicle, to find Chimp and Zee hiding in a tree, and on the last page, to give them a good night kiss. This book will appeal to the youngest audience, and its sturdy construction will hold up for lots of monkey fun."
5,"YUM! What's not to like, it's your own Wheat beer!","You can buy the exact product from Mr. Beer's website, or get it on Amazon for quite a bit cheaper, and if you bundle with other stuff, get free shipping! Yay! I am always dismayed at Mr Beer's $7 to ship one order....Here on Amazon, I get it shipped for free! If I order several beer mixes, it's like getting one for free! And if you purchase a pint of raspberries at the grocery store, blend them and add them to the wort, you get a delicious Raspberry Wheat beer...What's not to like!"
3,Good but not everyhing has a replacement part,I had these headphones for 3 yaers. Very comfortable. Good bass response. I listen to everyhing from Classical to Hip Hop. I replaced the cord a few months back. Now I am faced with a broken driver. I was on Sennheiser's site and could not find a replacement piece. Even though the driver pops right now. This is somewhat annoying. If you are not technical enough to do these sort of replacements then don't worry about this. But if you are capable of fixing it yourself look for a set that has total replacements. Like the HD580 or HD600.pearcec DOT com
4,Rock on!,"I love these phones after using them for about 2 months. Initially, i was slightly dissapointed because to me they sounded slightly muffled. The reason for this is because i've always owned cheaper headphones that artificially coloured the sound to favour the mid/high frequencies. The HD500 does not do this. In fact, it's very neutral and quite a flat frequency response. As such, the sound doesn't immediately ""jump"" at you, and people are more likely to be less impressed when listening for the first time (especially those used to headphones that are more ""trebley""). However, like the previous reviewer, i find that these headphones are not fatiguing at all. The clarity and frequency extension is wonderful. These are best driven with a headphone amplifier or out of a good receiver/amp. Those wishing to use portables either get an amp or buy the HD400 range of phones."
5,The best of Anathema,"Anathema is one of the bands, which creates himselffrom album to album. After my opinion this album is their climax. They deserve to be in a position, which must be better than they are in. Feel and Fragile Dreams are songs to be memorized. Just go and buy this album. Otherwise you will miss a lot."
2,Very Basic,"I was hoping for a more comprehensive and informative discussion on bits. This is a very basic what are they, how do they work type of book."
4,Use for help with thyroid care,"I use this supplement to help with hypothyroidism. This combined with a healthy diet, some daily exercise, and a good nights sleep has made a difference for me."
4,RE4 - Epic Wii Low Res 480i,"A very good port from the GC version. Controlling this game with the wiimote is far more confortable than before. The negative about this was keeping the same resolution and not improving at least the texture quality, as well as not using the 480p resolution used in most recent wii games. The extras are excellent."
5,happy,"I loved the game was the best gift for my nephew, the game arrived in very good condition all fully sealed"
4,great game,I spent about a week staying up late past bed time to finish this game. I went to bed around 3 in the morning and i am 30 years old. It is a great game for a weeks worth of entertaiment.
4,Very unsettling,"RE4 trades in the horror element for shear terror, and it's great. Freaks chasing you with torches, jumping in windows, climbing up ladders to get you. Just like my childhood in rural Spain. Playing with the Wii remote and nunchuk give it a great interactive feel. Totally worth it."
2,Not Up To Expectations,"I have been playing PC games for some time and have my favorites due mostly to their ease of use and the simplicity of the controls. Half Life and F.E.A.R. are great examples of what I like. This game falls far short in the ease of use and the sophistication categories. While the Wii control system is kind of neat, it also is clumsy and problematical. Not much fun this. High frustration level."
5,Pretty fun,Pretty fun game but seeing I played it first on xbox360 is was much of the same but different seeing it was played with the wii remote. A definate buy for a halloween night or friday the 13th.
4,Grown-up fun for when you just need to kill something!,I'll keep it short and simple:Quite an 'edge-of-the-seat' plot that does have you checking around corners just in case. I probably would have given up on it a few times if I hadn't downloaded a walkthough from the net; some parts were just a little complicated for my old brain.Interesting range of demons and bad guys though at times I just got bored with shooting them. The Merchant is an interesting distraction and necessity and you do have to choose wisely sometimes. I do wish he sold bullets though!!!Overall it's fun and will kill a great number of hours over time; it gives you a chance to chill out and still challenge your senses.
1,Game didn't work,The game that was shipped to us did not load in our Wii. So I have no idea if the game was fun.
2,Ho Hum....Gee what happens next?,"I've played this game off and on for over a year or two. It's semi fun, but there is no real mystery to it. Every time I enter a room there is a brief movie/animation. Then I die 2 or 3 times until I figure out the puzzle. There is no fluidity to the game and you have no options as to which path you take through the game. Unimaginative and frankly boring. The designers are phoning it in."
5,Best game I've ever played on my Wii,"Seriously, fun game, the controls were perfect. I honestly can't think of any complaints, everything worked and worked well. It had excellent level design, never felt tunneled, like you do in Resident Evil 5 on the 360, no inventory issues either. It just worked, had an interesting story, was extremely fun to play. I traded off with a friend back and forth over a three day period until we beat it. An Excellent experience."
5,"After Years of Searching, Could it Finally Be Here...","When I was a kid I loved the show SWAT, some years later they brought the show back in repeats and much to my dismay, the show was terrible! I began to realize that sometimes memories are better than the real thing, happily, that is not always true. The CD release of White Sister's first album shows how good a band they were and how good their music was. It is heavy and crisp, a bit over-produced, but still very solid and inventive. I dare any first time listener not to hear their influence on other bands that came along later. The two vocalists and sharp harmonies still sound great after 15+ years. If you like 80's hair/heavy rock, tight melodies/harmonies, great musicianship and reliving your youth; then this is the CD for you! There be no need for a SWAT team here!"
5,Cute Costume,Bought this costume because my 6 year old daughter and I did a dance to Bop To The Top in a recital. It fit well and looked nice. She can also use it as dress up now. It was well worth the $20 I paid.
4,"Great quality, slightly late","This is an updated review of product:Quality of product: 5/5Helpfulness of seller: 5/5UPS delivery service: 3/5. Seller contends that they shipped on time and that the UPS shipment was cause for delay.Original review left February 28, 2012: ""I was buying this for an ASQ exam, and ordered expedited (1-day) delivery so I could begin studying. Unfortunately it arrived 3 days late and when I tried to contact the seller asking for tracking number I did not receive a response. The quality of the book is great, and matched the ordering description so I am happy to have received it eventually."""
2,Dissapointing,"I was quite excited to listen to these headphones, but I was quickly dissapointed. They cannot reach loud volumes without comprimising sound quality. Ever person in the room can hear your music clearly. The sound out of these headphones is good at low volumes, but you can't listen to them very loud. Not a very good value at all. A very poor investment."
3,superior headphpones for the cost,"The other reviewers are certainly correct about these 'phones, they are a touch on the bass heavy side. If it bothers you, that's what the EQ is for... However, compared to headphones from all other manufacturers (with the possible exception of Koss) at the same price point, these headphones are a breath of fresh air. Mate them with a quality output source, and you will not be disappointed."
2,Don't be fooled by the title of this book.,"This book belongs to the kind that gives you highest expectation before strongest disappointment.Implied by its title, I bet most people will presume it focuses on the DESIGN of a video codec, not a REVIEW of various techniques in standards.Unfortunately, only Chap. 13 has sth to do with DESIGN.This book may be useful for people who do not know much about video coding, but it's not for people who looks for information on how to design a video codec.From my experience, open source/free software packages, like MPEG4IP, MPEG2encode/decode, TMN H.263 codec, and standards documentation will offer much much more for a reader interested in DESIGN.Not recommended because the title is too misleading."
2,Black Tones,"Although the TV is actually pretty good, the unit has a difficult time with black. I have it attached to a Dishnetwork system, which is digital, and when there is a black object or background the picture quality leaves much to desire. My Sony Wega works like a charm, so I know it is not the Dishnetwork's problem. Plus, Panasonic has one of the worst customer service departments in the industry."
2,Life's loss,I didnt love this book. Its written ok. It is about the losses in life and the moments we remember that will trouble us. The author's style is not captivating however.
1,Looks=10 ... Works=4,"I open dozens of bottles per week, more than most folks I'd guess. And I had just lost my long-time favorite waiter's corkscrew, and bought one of these because it looked good and professional. It still looks good and professional, but the worm bent after just a couple of tougher pulls, and it will never go in straight again. I'd buy this to look at, but not to use."
3,a plow,"A little difficult to plow through....better for listners than readers, I will be able to use as a reference."
5,"Lively, Entertaining and Informative","This book does an amazing job in telling us how our minds really work. I have found most books on this subject to be tedious and difficult to read. But because Weiner keeps the writing lively and entertaining as well as informative, and intersperses his text with an imaginary and imaginative sub-plot involving Sigmund Freud, the book makes for a great read."
3,"From the picture I cannot tell if it's the same ""Lady Ann Crystal Goblet"" like the set I own. The stem looks different. Is it?","I have a question. The stem looks different from my set. Missing a 'cut' just below the bottom of the glass. I need a replacement, but don't know if this is the same. My set is about 17 years old, but IS Lady Ann by Gorham. Please explain."
1,Sending it back,"My son wanted this for Xmas. I should have paid more attention to the dimensions, as it is only big enough to hold a SMALL notebook, not a regular text book."
3,Smaller than it looks.,"The bag is a lot smaller than it looks in the picture. I was hoping to get my laptop into it, but sadly, I'm unable too.No inner pockets, and leather straps are hard to buckle/unbuckle (I don't bother with them). Bag is more khaki than green (as it appears in the picture).Other than that I'm pleased. The canvas is high quality, the bottom of the bag is even re-enforced with an extra layer. Very long, adjustable strap. Shipping was very fast also.It is a nice bag, but I probably would not buy again, based on the size issue."
3,not quite what I was looking for,The rothco bag is the right size and shape however all the pictures on the web show it rather square or rectangular giving the idea that it has some rigidity. Not the case it is as soft as a pillow case. I have to put a stiff piece of cardboard in the back without which the bag is just irritating and does not serve my purpose. Live and learn
4,Great lil bag,This is a great little bag but the strap isn't the best in the world but other than that it's great
4,Perfect,"I use this bag for a diaper bag for my son. It's a bag with no frills, works great and has not blown out yet. You do get what you pay for, a bomber bag that does what it is made to do, carry stuff."
2,"Okay, but its not the item in the picture","Bag arrived quickly, but its not the same as the picture or item description. Picture shows and item description says ""khaki"", which is a yellowish tan, (like the pic). Bag is actually dark green. Item description says brown star--star on the bag is bright red. Item pic shows a medic hang tag; the item description says ""hang tag"". Bag arrived without medic hang tag, just a cardboard UPC tag that says ""made in India""."
3,Cheap...but does the job...,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves messenger bags and his daddy, my husband, is a medic, so he thought that was cool. He is 7, so it serves it's purpose well for him, but it is definitely poorly made. I don't expect it to last him the year. But as the previous reviewer observed: ""you get what you pay for"". And for the price, it's decent."
4,Nice little pack.,"It's a great value for the price. The bag is a nice thick canvas material, yet still very soft. The only thing I was disappointed in was the ""leather"" straps. Very cheap, stiff, fake leather which does not belong on an otherwise fantastic bag."
4,Smaller than expected,I was a bit disappointed at first when I received the bag. It's much smaller than what you would expect by looking at the picture. After using it for a while I found that the size really isn't that much of a drawback. Just don't expect to fit much more than a few notebooks in it. The bag seems to be well made. Not sure how it will stand up to the washing machine. All in all I would recommend it. I absolutely love the look of it and for the price you really can't go wrong.
3,One time play,"It was really a one time play through type game. After beating the game once the battles are more or less the same. Characters are setup like a harem for the main character, when it supposed to be a tactics battle game. Some of the girls are really scanty in their clothing, so they made it look really anime, however it was kind of lame combined with the game type. The unique characters are fun, but romance element came out really corny."
2,Extreme Error!,"I've bought 2 of this model of deep fryer and both had the same problem. Error at a certain temperature. The error clears after about 5 restarts, but eventually the thing just stops working. I would NEVER buy another model of Delonghi deep fryer. However Delonghi is not all bad. I do have a Delonghi coffee maker.. It works well."
2,I Hate This Fryer,"Ok, I have owned quite a few fryers, I run a home Child Care business so I use my fryer at least once a week for chicken nuggets and french fries. This fryer clicks into an error mode and theirs nothing you can do, I have tried extra cleaning, the reset button and resetting it over and over. The handle on the basket can easily fall into the oil. I have only owned this one for about 6 months now and for the money I would look at other brands, will never buy a Delonghi again."
3,it's just ok,"My unit(same model#) has a digital display instead of a dial as in the photo here.PROS: It does what it's supposed to & has a large capacity & cooks evenly.CONS:Because it uses a full gallon of oil, it takes a long time to heat. The temperature recovery time between batches is long as well.The basket handle folds inward(for storage) which makes emptying hot food difficult & messy.The cord safety ""feature"" is annoying. The plug frequently detaches with the slightest movement & then the unit must be re-programmed.I personally don't care for the digital display. I would rather turn a dial & wait for a ready-light, than press buttons repeatedly.It's big & greasy, so I have nowhere to store it unless it's been emptied & cleaned. For me, it's expensive and wasteful to fill with a gallon of oil, only to throw it away after one use."
1,Do not buy this deep fryer.,"Barely out of warranty and getting the same ""err"" as everyone else. Waist of money. DO NOT BUY!"
4,Pretty Good,This armband is very comfortable but the velcro lost its stickiness after about a year. I did buy another one because its lightweight and not bulky like some other armbands.
3,Decent controller but defective battery,"I have this controller for nearly 6 months, and during that time, two rechargeable batteries died on me. Nyko was nice enough to replace it for me, but this is getting to be an inconvenience. Luckily it does come with a battery pack that uses AA battery.Aside from the battery issue, I like the controller. I believe its ergonomic is better than the PS3 controller. It feels heavier and better suited for me. The rumble pack is nice. It's responsive.Compare to the SIXAXIS PS3 controller, I believe that its quality is a bit lacking but one cannot complaint too much about its price.As most of you probably already know, this is not a BT device, so it takes a USB port. It also cannot turn on your PS3; however, this is a minor issue for me."
2,Spotty at best,"Bought these controllers as add-ons to what came with the purchase of the PS3. These have not been wireless at all. If it worked with just the USB sensor plugged in, I'd give it one more star. The controllers we have MUST be plugged in for it to be on. Sometimes this controller doesn't even work. Sometimes it just doesn't turn on. Sometimes the buttons and toggles don't work. Every now and then it does work. Would not recommend it."
1,would not buy again,this is big and bulky and not a very good product for the playstation. if you have big hands it would work but not for a teenager
1,"Great at first, now it's terrible.","UPS missed me at 2:30 PM on a Friday, so I went to pick it up at 7:30 PM. I was very excited to play Metal Gear Online with vibration, and I did play. A few hours of gameplay time later, I went to bed. The next morning, while I was cooking up some breakfast, I was playing Burnout Paradise and I noticed my R1 was very sensitive and apparently putting just a feather on it triggered it to read it as a button press, it was frustration. Soon after that, my controller began to get out of sync a lot, it was unbearable. I threw this controller out, waste of [...] dollars that could've went towards LittleBigPlanet. I'll just buy an official DualShock 3 from here now, I thought Nyko could've done better."
2,PlayStation 3 Zero Wireless Controller,Pros- Quality of the joysticks and buttons- Vibration- Rechargeable batteryCons- D-Pad is flimsy- Takes up a usb- Sometimes is acts up and needs to be reset
1,Poor quality and longevity,"I bought two of these for Christmas and both have failed significantly since purchase. If I hadn't bought them from Amazon for the giveaway price of $[...] each I would be highly upset.The first failed since it was received. It has a misfire of the R1 button where when depressing it usually sets off the triangle button instead. Despite disassembling and generally tinkering with the controller, it remains a 50:50 proposition of what function it does. How many games can you get away with that failure? This relegated its use to only being a battery charger for the second controller.For the second, it failed after less than five weeks of use. The second one failed by the R1 button totally stop functioning. Again this means it is totally useless.Between the units high weight, lack of bluetooth, require a USB dongle, no power on from the controller and VERY questionable quality make this controller a bad bet. I highly recommend looking elsewhere."
3,"Awesome cheap replacement, but not for little hands","I bought this product to play around with. Sure it will be useful for people with big hands. But since my hands are smaller, I found that the original PS3 controllers fit my hand better. This is the kind of controller you can MAYBE give to the little ones so they don't break your real PS3 controller. Again, I bought this to play around with the LED buttons. They can be modded to a different color though it cannot be any brighter. I also changed the USB receiver to a blue LED instead of red. Other than that, its not really mod-able since I cannot find the right powerpoint to power more LED's.It has decent rumble features though connecting the controller to your PS3 will be confusing at first. When was the last time someone read instructions to put a disc in the unit? Not as simple as a normal PS3 controller but the build is defiantly strong. Its cool, though I wouldn't use it everyday"
1,POS!!!!!! DONT BUY!,This thing literally broke the second time I used it. The d pad somehow came undone and I couldnt press up on it. I broke my own rule never to buy 3rd party and I paid for it. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!
4,Good for the basics,"For a serious Latin student or scholar, this is virtually useless, but the price and size make it a nice second dictionary to tote around in a backpack between classes, or good for a beginner. Is the print quality poor? Yes. Will it fall apart in time? Yes. But for the price, I could lose it and not care. If you plan to be a Latin major or do advanced readings, however, the Lewis and Short or the Oxford Latin Dictionary are far more comprehensive, and correspondingly far more expensive."
2,Poor quality of paper and print plus disappointing content,"I ordered this book for my father as he had asked me to get him a simple yet comprehensive text (he speaks fluent Latin as it was a prerequisite for medical studies in his day). He was extremely disappointed with what he considers to be very poor quality of paper and print used, and found the dictionary content similarly disappointing. Which just proves the point that it is always a complete nightmare shopping for anything for one's Dad, as it never seems to hit the spot, even on Amazon.com!"
2,another broken machine,"I just received the replacement machine for the one that I sent back. Guess what? It was defective as well. 0 for 2 and I am willing to give it a third try.If I get one that works, I know that I will be satisfied with the machine. It does make a good cup of joe. However, if there is so much as a scratch on this third machine, I will change my rating to 0 stars and try another manufacturer."
4,"Review of ""The Popular Bible Prophecy Workbook""","The book is easy reading and gives the information in an easy to understand dialog. With the charts that are included, the reader can understand easier the different interpertations of Bible prophecy. This workbook along with the Bible will help any Bible student better understand prophecy. The only area that I am disappointed with is the use of the NIV for most scripture references."
4,Just what I wanted and was expecting,"This album is fantastic!! There is only two songs on the album I would consider throwaways, My England and Those Were the Days. Otherwise the album is great, with beats that are inventive and S-O-V really stepping it up a notch. This girl is just going to keep getting better and better so remember her name."
2,she has balls,Heard some tracks and then saw her on Letterman. Why act like a guy if you're a girl? She is obnoxious. It would be a shame if any young females take her as a role model. The hooks were a little catchy but the girl herself is just obnoxious. No wonder Letterman didn't want himself caught on film shaking the girl's hand.
5,Must be made of the same stuff as airplane black boxes,"I have 2 goldendoodles at home and if you know anything about retrievers it is that they LOVE to play fetch. But they just chew and rip things to shreds. Having to get new toys every couple weeks is a pain and gets expensive. However, this guy right here is holding up to all the abuse; it must be made of some kind of super plastic. Whatever it is made of, it just works."
2,My dog didn't like it,It came recommended by my frizbee dog did not care for it so that is why I gave it 2 stars.
2,Not indestructible!,"Well, my big lab managed to get a plastic chunk out of this after the first 5 min of playing with it, so I'm not impressed! It did last longer than our $1 frisbees, but I think I'd rather have 25 of them than one of these."
5,Jawz Disc review,This product has held up so far with my blue heeler. She has been unable to destroy or even mark up this Jawz disc with her teeth. It floats really well and I love it. Great buy.
5,Best flying most rugged disc I've found!,"I wish I could include a photo of the discs I started with when I first worked with my cattle dog with a disc. They were hard plastic and after a couple weeks had holes punched through with very sharp edges - it's a wonder he didn't get injured. I did a little research and bought a couple of these hyperflite jawz 8.75 inch and have yet to take both out of their wrapping, only been using the one now (a couple times a day) for about a month and the only sign of wear is of the logo on top. The disc flies better than the other three hard ones I had been using. I don't recall ever being more satisfied with a product."
4,Very good and holding up better than Glow version,"Flys well and I am editing review as at first thought I was commenting on Glow version I ordered which I'm not sure is the same material as it has sharp barbs after 5-20 minute sessions, this Lemon-lime one has no barbs and is holding up well happy to say."
1,Don't waste your money!,Both of these broke...one after another the first time I tried to use them on a regular sized wine bottle. Buy the Zyliss ones instead - 4 for $7.99. Zyliss ones are great.
1,broke on the first use,"COmpletely useless, bad design and very bad quality. broke on the first use. Have used similar ones for 6 years, and never had one broken before. Got these, cause they looked polished and good. well bad idea!"
1,Not impressed,"I wasn't impressed with this item. When you look at the picture, it looks like a decent quality product, but its made farily cheap. I went to use one for the first time, and the black piece cracked and it was useless after that. The second one got only a few uses out of it before the metal piece bent and was also useless. I dont recommend this product at all."
1,Not worth anything.,These cheap plastic pieces of junk are not worth anything. Avoid them at all cost.
2,Regular,Perhaps I picked a too cheap item. I could never make it work correctly. Mi suggestion is: Don't buy it
1,Not worth the your Money or Time.,This micro Hearing enhancement and protection are JUNK.This item not only does not work but is worthless as a hearing improvement device.Would I buy this item again?? Not in this life Time.
3,"Ok, But Amplifies All Sounds","These work (I only needed to wear one) but amplify all sounds which is a problem for me. I guess they would be fine for watching TV or something like that but for someone like me that has trouble picking out a conversation where there is background noise, amplifying all sounds does not help me.They fit well into my ear and were surprisingly comfortable!I need something better than this but still, for the price, they are a bargain!"
1,Actually makes hearing worse,I bought these for my mother who is 86 and has partial hearing loss typical of seniors her age. She had previously gone to a hearing specialist who recommended expensive hearing aids. Before we went that route she wanted to give these inexpensive hearing amplifiers a chance. We tested this product by reading lists of 25 different words. I read 5 lists with the product in her ear and 5 lists without it. The surprising result was that she asked me to repeat words not understood more than twice as often with the product then without. This product is not worth your time or money.
3,ear buds for beginners,My hearing is just a little fuzzy. I didn't want to invest a lot just to see if I could tolerate something in my ear. Surprisingly they are okay. I wouldn't say that if they cost as much as some of my old friends claim they paid but okay for this old cheapskate who didn't expect miracles.
1,Disappointing,I purchased this after hearing one song on a local radio station. That song I found intriguing. The album was not. I've owned it for quite some time. It has been spun no more than three times. Don't waste your money.
3,HUGE tool.,"This is not your average sized Gerber tool. It is about 30-40% larger than any other I have ever seen (won't fit in most pockets). It is advertised as a one hand opening tool. For the most part, that is correct. The pliers and main blades are easily opened with one hand, but the smaller tools and large screwdriver will require two hands to open. The pliers are very large, but come to a tiny point so they don't function well as needle-nose because they're too big and they don't work well as regular pliers because the grip area is tiny. I think the folks over at Gerber are onto something with this tool, but one might wait to see what comes out next before settling on this tool."
1,This is the worst poetry I have ever read. Seriously.,"I'm not saying this as someone with little exposure to poetry. I have an MFA in creative writing, and this book serves as an inspiration to any promising poet. The inspiration is: if this author can be published, ANYONE can be published.The verse is clunky at best. It's just bad. I received the book as a gift to read with my kids, and I can't do it. I've tried several times to go back and see if another poem might be readable, but the meter of the poetry is so haphazzard that it really is nearly impossible to read aloud. Some of the pictures are nice to look at... but not nice enough that it makes me want to revisit any of the poems. I am not trying to trash this author, as much as I'm trying to compell people not to waste their money on something that really does not have much potential for family reading enjoyment. Sorry... but this stuff is just horrible."
5,EXCELLENT,I could not put this book down. I have read all of Ms. Jenkin's books and I have enjoyed every last on of them. The charecters make you laugh as well as cry. You want they to be happy. Sable is very brave and you will love her. Raimond is a sweet heart.
5,An Unexpected Treat!,"I haven't read a romance novel since I was 15 years old - and that was 30+ years ago. I stumbled upon this book while looking for a good book to read on my new Kindle. I have never heard of Beverly Jenkins, but after seeing all the 4 and 5 star reviews, as well as the Black faces on the covers of the books, I decided to give this one a try. I LOVED it! The book was great - nothing like the old Harlequin romances I read as a teen. There was a lot of historical info, interesting characters, and good, old fashioned love and romance. I've already purchased a second book, and trying to decide which one to buy next.So glad I found Ms. Jenkins! Keep up the good work!"
4,a definite must read,"I always enjoy when characters you have met in one story(Indigo) are so intriguing, they deserve their own (in this case Raimond Le Veq ). As usual BJ did not disappoint. A well written story with the usual steamy romance is what you will find in the story of Raimond and Sable. I was especially delighted with Sable's history as a descendant of Queens and a Queen herself. And I thought that it brought a certain closure, that after previous Queens coming to tragic ends (Sable's mother and grandmother), that she could find happiness. Additonally, it was nice to see Raimond put through his paces(especially after teasing Galen so much in Indigo)"
5,5 STAR BOOK .........STORM BY B.E. JENKINS,I LOVE THE WAY JENKINS HAS INCORPORATED HISTORY WITH FICTION IN THIS TALE. SABLE'S CONNECTION TO HER ANCESTOR'S MOTHERLAND HELD ME CAPTIVE TO WANT MORE OF THIS STORY. THIS WAS A BOOK THAT I COULD NOT PUT DOWN!
5,"Mitsubishi, Sony? Don't make that mistake!","I have owned this TV for almost a year now and just recently added the RCA DTC100 (HDTV Reciever) to my system, WoW! You can't do better then Pioneer tv's. Recently I had a visitor to my home and he said ""Why is your picture so awsome?"". This person spent...more then I did on a Mitsubishi HDTV needless to say he was VERY upset. If you have the chance, BUY ONE! You will not be disapointed...I have had great success with my game console (sony) To bad Pioneer does not make one."
1,Wouldnt really recommend it.,Book is somewhat outdated and published or written in England so it contains some abbreviations and medical terminology we don't necessarily use in the States.
3,"An intriguing, if not compelling, read","An intriguing discussion of the author's belief that cats have culture (which is learned, as distinguished from behavior, which is genetic), based mostly on her experience with ""big"" cats in Africa, Asia, and elsewhere.Worth reading just for her anecdotes of the changing ecoscape of sub-Saharan Africa. There are some gems here -- her discussion of tourists in Colorado seeing a Puma and mistakenly thinking ""Awwww, look, the Puma looks just like a big version of our cute little kitty cat,"" instead of more wisely thinking ""Whoa! Good thing our cat isn't that big."""
2,Yawn,"Elizabeth Thomas seems to know a lot about cats and if you can force yourself to read this book you will undoubtedly learn a bit about felines large and small. However, prepare yourself for a slog. The tone suggests that she is a little too impressed with her many field trips to be good company and she belabors much of her telling. I received this as a Christmas gift in December 2007 from a friend aware of my long history with and love of cats (I have lived with cats since 1964.) I have picked up and put down the book multiple times over that year and finally decided I am not going to finish it. Life is too short."
1,author is an idiot,"As far as I am concerned this woman is a idiot who is at best irresponsible and at worst an animal abuser. She advocates letting your precious cats outdoors where they are at the mercy of cars and vicious dogs. She knows a lot about vicious dogs since she let one of hers kill a cat. She also doesn't believe in spay/neuter. She lets her cats multiply. I wonder how many end up in the gas chambers at local pounds. I'm sickened by her ignorance and irresponsibility. If you love animals, don't waste your money on this poorly-written garbage by a stupid woman who is passing herself off as an expert."
1,Misled by Cover Photo...,"I generally liked her other book, the Social Lives of Dogs, and in fact read it twice over the course of the previous year. I felt as though I learned a lot about canine behavior and their social organization. This book however was a terrible disappointment for me. I checked it out of the library after giving one as a gift to a friend, only to find that there was very little written about house cats (my primary interest), and all the talk of big cats and anecdotes from the author's many years in Africa seemed indulgent and not even terribly insightful for those interested in these topics.I'd urge you to look for a copy in your local library or bookstore and scan through it before commitment to the cover price."
2,A BIT OF A LET DOWN,"Robert Kennedy was my very first hero as a child. Although I enjoyed to some degree the psychological portrait of the man, I was very perturbed by the author's contention that the Attorney General in any way engineered his brother's death. To suggest such a thing is to suggest pure madness as RFK was absolutely devoted to his brother and often sublimated his own identity during his Attorney General years so as to better serve his brother. I found that concept preposterous and completely without merit. Robert Kennedy was the only one of the brothers that I liked and I believed he had a lot of personal integrity, moral conviction and certainly a brave one. He met personal goals and was an extremely hard worker who had a lot to show for his efforts. In some way I feel this book trivialized his political career. Robert Kennedy is an interesting man in his own right and I think much more interesting than any of his brothers. I really felt somewhat disappointed in this book."
4,Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe,"I had previously read ""The God Delusion"", by the very well known Atheist biologist Richard Dawkins. After reading Dawkins book, I felt a little disheartned because I was sure I had become an atheist. Brian Greene's book changed all of that. In the book, Greene gave me reason to beleive there are simply things in the universe or multiuniverse which can never be explained. I think it is a wonderful book for anybody interested in the evolution of the universe in which we live. Greene explaines things very well in non-technical terms. I'd give it 5 stars, but there was some of it I just couldn't understand.The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory"
1,The Elegant Universe ... Glitzty at best,"Having followed Brian Greene for years now, I really have written him off as a scientist, and reclassified him as a public relations genius. ""The Elegant Universe"", like most of Greene's writings is chock-a-block with romantic images of an alternative reality. The only problem is, where is the axiomatic working formula?Brian Greene is always an interesting read, but I always toss his books on my same library shelf as my sci-fi and comic book collections. A much better book is Michio Kaku's ""Hyperspace"" (and other works) for those who are interested in a more academic, but easily understandable, presentation on this subject."
4,Clearly understandable description of scientific research,This book reads like a novel. Greene manages to make a very complex subject accessible via clear and often humouristic analogies to bring home the essence of scientific thinking.
4,Good explanation for normal people,"This is the only book mainly about string theory I read, although this topic was quoted in other phisic's book, so I can't tell if it is complete or very precise. For sure it is very interesting and is a good introduction for those who want to know more about edge research without being edge researcher. I found it a little too difficult in some points (expecially toward the end) but I have to say that English is not my mother tongue and this can have influenced my comprehension on such hard topics. The only defect I found is that in the end the author slides a little to much toward speculations, with a lot of ""maybe"" and ""if"" that perhaps could have been avoided."
1,A Simpler Way,"Special Relativity is obsolete because it is unfalsifiable. General Relativity gives the right results but in a round about and convoluted way. Einstein is at his best when it comes to quantum mechanics. A much simpler approach to physics and understanding the Universe can be found in the Michelson-Gale and Brillet-Hall experiments as well as the Sagnac experiment and Hayden's exposition on star aberration. Ultimately, all paradoxes can be resolved through classical physics alone. I recommend ""Einstein Plus Two"" by Petr Beckmann for the professional and ""Questioning Einstein"" by Tom Bethell for the layman."
3,"Thoughtful, detailed, but a bit heavy-handed","Brian Greene believes in superstrings. He really, really, believes in them. He also seems to believe some of the more far-flung implications of the theory. These positions are intellectually defensible, but they are by no means certain. Yet despite some perfunctory disclaimers, Greene presents his conclusions as facts, or as almost-facts-that-will-be-nailed-down-soon. This, plus the density of the text, means that anyone interested in superstrings might want to start with a simpler, less partisan explanation of where the science has come from and where it is going, and then read this book to get more mathematical details."
4,"If you're a patient person or a beginner, buy it!","I agree with the reader from London(who wrote the first review) that the style is sometimes pedantic and that the book could be contracted, but,even if this proves to be a little boring in the first part of the book, it turns out to be of great help in the following chapters, where more difficult concepts are introduced. Basically, if you already know the basics of relativity and quantum mechanics, you'll have to be patient and keep on reading in the first part, while if you're a complete beginner, this book is perfect for you. Anyway, I'd advise anyone who is interested in particle physics and at least a little bit willing to put some effort into reading and understanding a book to buy this very interesting piece of work."
3,A little too simplistic,If you're somewhat versed in particle theory with a decent mathematical background this book is probably not for you. I was looking for a book dealing with string theory that was somewhat more advanced with more mathematical detail. This appears to be targeted at the pure novice with limited education or background in physics. Professor Greene does a good job explaining some complex ideas in terms the novice should understand. However his examples are just too simplistic and in some cases border on insipid. In general I find a dearth of books for those somewhere between the total novice and the subject matter expert in terms of particle physics knowledge and mathematics. Unfortunately this book continues that trend.
3,DRM book,"Warning. This is a DRM book; Digital Rights (Restrictive) Management, which means:1. you don't really own it2. you can only read it on Kindle3. your'e indirectly paying to maintain this restrictive practice.Amazon; how about labelling the book DRM. Then I can search around and buy a copy that isn't, which means I won't buy it from you."
4,Greene breaks it down for you.,"I've met the Author after a lecture and book signing at the Fermi Labs in Illinois. As a speaker,writer and physicist he is brilliant. He can convey his point without relying on overly complex mathamatics and even adds a sense of fun and discovery to his writings. This is one of the rare books that works for the highly advanced specialist as well as the casual backyard science enthusiast. If you only read one book about super strings this year, this should be it!"
4,String Theory for the Layman,"The author does a good job presenting string theory and the concept of alternate universes in somewhat easy to understand terms. Effective uses of analogy serve the cause well. The subject matter, while technically complex, is presented in such a way that the reader should have little difficulty in grasping the subject matter. In the tradition of Stephen Hawking's Brief History of Time, Brian Greene's book is a easy to understand, mindbending look into the unseen forces that shape our very reality."
5,"""Educational Material""","By Albert C. Bender, Author of ""You are forever in time""..""The Elegant Universe"" clearly ampliefied for me, this authors knowledge and intellect on the subject he has written. It provides information that truly moves to the core of the subject matter that the author speaks about......It is well written and thought-provoking throughout. I recommend this book highly to those who's interest lie within---A 5 star rating, without a doubt."
4,Surprisingly Accessible,"About as exciting and accessible as any book can be on the topic of quantum mechanics and super string theory. Greene boils down excruciatingly complex topics into simple metaphors and figurative examples, helping the reader wrap his/her head around the concept of the existence of 11 different dimensions and the laws of physics that govern them."
5,String Theory explained beautifully,"I was searching for books on superstring theory, but they all seem either too complex (too much math and formalism and few down-to-earth physics) or seem too vague (sometimes without really talking about superstring theory). Until I found this book.Brian Greene was able, in a single and relatively short book, explain the basic ideas of Superstring Theory and its context in the current Particle Physics and Cosmology theories.Without using any math, Greene makes you feel almost an expert on Superstring Theory. A must-have."
2,Kindle edition is broken!,"Book is great, but kindle edition has many c's swapped out for e's. Not unintelligible, but eertenly distraeting, if you get my meaning."
5,Arn Movie,Excellent series. Very well done Highly recommended. The original language is not a problem. Sub-title are explicit. Excellent actors. Which the serie will be longuer.
5,"I don't love it, my dogs do!","Excellent, low fat & healthy cookies for my 2 canine kids! I always keep them on hand - great container too."
4,Of course kids love it!!!,"It's true MOST kids ages 3-8 love to hear the word or the bodily function of farting. My kids (ages 6 and 10) thought the book was hilarious. After we read it together, they went through the book over and over looking at the great pictures. They also noticed the little spider on each page. The only problem I found with the book is that my kids love talking about ALL of the time, no matter where we are."
4,An angry hate-filled masterpiece,"I just love this album. It's so angry and aggressive that it makes a perfect soundtrack to a bad day at the office. Imagine a combination of death metal, hardcore and Black Sabbath-esque stoner rock, all played very fast and brutal, and then you've got an idea behind the Ragin Speedhorn sound. The sheer heaviness means this isn't an album that everyone will enjoy, but if you like bands like Iron Monkey and Earthtone9, or just fast heavy music, then I can guarantee that you will like this."
3,For the die-hard fan,"There are a few good songs on this collection, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to the casual listener. Its more for the hardcore Elvis fan who just cant get enough Elvis. Actually, its not a terrible compilation really, except for ""Yoga Is As Yoga Does"" (from the movie ""Easy Come, Easy Go""), which is probably one of the worst songs ever recorded by anybody in the history of sound reproduction. I'm sure Elvis would never have a recorded a song like that if he were not obligated to do so. I could think of a million better songs that could have taken it's place here (in which case I might have given it 4 stars!).All in all this compilation is not representative of Elvis' best work, but its something the die-hard fans will want to have."
2,A mediocre collection,"This album was a budget collection of previously released songs from Elvis' movies. Released in 1971 it was not a hit, only reaching 104 on the Billboard album chart in the US; however it would eventually be certified GOLD by the RIAA. It did better in the UK reaching number 26. None of the songs were hits and this is not one of Elvis' better collections."
1,GARBAGE,bought this thing...HOPING i could get it to work despite all the negative things ive read about it.so far its-over skimmed and wasted alot of water.-stoppped skimming overbight-flooded my living room twice-filled the tank with bubblesITS LOUDER THAN EVERYTHING PUT TOGHEDERIT DOESNT WORK UNLESS YOU CONSTANTLY ADJUST ITMANUAL DESPITE ITS LACK OF DETAIL EXPLAINS HOWTO WORK IT BUT the unit itself is poorly designed.dont make the mistake i made...buy a skimmer with a 5 star review
1,sansa transmitter,wrong transmitter advertized with sansa e250 as accessory had to may $11.00 in shipping fees not refunded on docking station
4,wobbly extended arm but great sound,"the review of feb 2006 from soundless in seattle simply not true. i have mark levinson lexus sound, its better than the cd sound. People who really bought this would know its only flaw is for the flexible arm to wobble on sharp turns, hence only 4 stars."
2,Amazon description error,"Does it work, yes. Does it perform as advertised, no. The Amazon description states that it runs from battery power. IT CAN'T. Therefore, I can only use it in a car.... Other equally priced units can be used in multiple locations. I give it 3 stars because it can power the unit from the vehicle, but subtract one star for the inaccurate description."
3,Willie Mays 70s Cartoon Baseball History by Rankin Bass,"This is the official STAR CLASSICS Home Video Release VHS. I believe the only release of this cartoon short. It is not available on DVD the last time I checked.Historic baseball great Willie Mays, the Star outfielder of the New York Giants - in a made for TV Cartoon Special - Lost Cult Classic.

5,Good substitute for Postum,"I used Postum for years and when Kellogg stopped production I found Cafix to fill the gap. It has a smooth taste, very similar to coffee and postum. I purchase it by the case from Amazon and a case of 6 - 7.05 ounce containers lasts about 6 months. I still prefer Postum but it isn't available and Cafix fills the gap."
1,Maybe a bit too canned.,All the reviews so far sound like personal friends of B.W. who are puffing the book. The book is simple and would require more information. So why not just go buy a book with more information.
1,Don't even think about buying this unit.,"We received this as a employee gift and were so excited to have it. Not only does it not fill anything pass 15 PSI, the 12V cord is very cheaply made where it plugs into your cig. lighter. The plastic on the tip started to crack after pulling it out. With the few more times we used it, I the tip completely broke. At least it comes with 7 year warranty. Save yourself the disapointment and headache."
1,Don't bother!,It took 20 mins to fill a car tire from 20psi to 30psi. Truck Air? -- It could barely fill a car tire. It would take over 3 hours for it to reach 300psi if it even could make it. STAY CLEAR.
1,hoffritz mandoline,"This product came without directions on how to use it. Also, you can only slice about one half of a potato or onion before slicing the black plastic around the blade. This product is a waste of time."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!,"I found this item to be a total waste of time. It was very difficult to use. I had to cut even small potatoes in half to make them fit into the handle, and then I had to slam the handle with my hand to get it to go down to make a slice, and then push very hard to get a slice of potato. I ended up slicing the rest of my potatoes by hand, taking half as much time. I will be returning this item for a refund."
2,This is the most awkward piece in my kitchen,".....but I still use it because it was inexpensive. It however, is too small for large vegetables, like russet potatoes."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"This slicer would be more useful if it had better instructions. It took me at least 5 or 6 tries before I learned that there is a simple, easy trick to remove the blades -- before that, I struggled with them by brute force. Also, it took a lot of practice to be able to get nice, uniform slices, which was the whole reason I bought the product. I have not yet been able to get the julienne and French fry blades to work properly. I just get mush. And the slicing area is not wide enough for a big potato, onion, or fennel bulb.Still, now that I have gotten the hang of slicing, I do find an occasional use for it."
1,Yikes! Save your money.,"I bought this a few years ago from Amazon. I used it once. In the cabinet it sits, just waiting to be thrown out.It does not work well at all. It is difficult to push the vegetables through. A large portion of them do not get cut up. It is a hassle to try to get this thing clean.What a nightmare! Avoid this at all costs. I beg of you."
1,A disappointed Hoffritz fan,"Everything I have ever purchased with the Hoffritz name up until now has been great. Maybe this slicer is too, but being one who cannot figure things out without directions, my many attempts to use it have been in vain. The enclosed brochure doesn't help you much in placing the blades correctly, using the holding mechanism, and the little rack that holds the other blades is very flimsy with no directions on how to use it.I took a chance when buying it after reading the mixed reviews, but it was a Hoffritz and was on sale for a cheap price, so I took a chance. Since it only cost ..., it's not worth spending the money returning. I'll just use the metal bowl and lid. The rest I'll ..."
1,Difficult,The blades are hard to remove once they are inserted. The pronged holder is difficult to insert into the vegetable. I find the whole process much more difficult to maneuver than I had anticipated.
4,You must respect the Mandoline.,"I've always wanted a mandoline, but in my zealous I forgot to respect the mandoline and cut my thumb. It slices like a dream on both the thin and thick circular blade. However it was hard to get the rhythmn needed for the french fry cut and the julienne cut. I'm sure practice will make perfect. It was worth the money just to have my vegtables sliced in such a short time. The free peeler and parer are FANTASTIC, plus they fit comfortable in your palm."
3,How to remove blades,"Like other purchasers of the Hoffritz Mandoline. I nearly sent it back because the blades were so hard to remove. But I sent an email to Hoffritz complaining of the difficulty, and got a useful reply. Here it is:""We regret the unfortunate experience that you have described. There is a little trick on trying to remove the blades, you need to place the mandoline slicer on a flat and level surface and then you lift the blade a little bit and pull it out.""This actually works! Just lift the gripping end of the blade upward and the blade will pull out without much trouble. For mysterious reasons the directions that come with the slicer fail to mention this useful fact."
2,watch your fingers,"They slicer is a pain to use. The cutting inserts require an act of god to remove because they are wedged in so tight. The little nub provided to remove them is not sufficient and merely provides a speed bump as your had flies by. The cutter is cumbersome with little ability to hold the food item you are slicing. It is much easier to use your hand to hold the vegetable as you slice. However, then you run the chance of having a little finger with your vegetables. I would not buy this item again and plan on replacing it with a more viable candidate."
1,Very disappointed - not a real Mandoline at all,"I like the idea of the attached bowl, but found that the blade didn't slice that well. I tried potatoes for an potato au gratin dish and was very frustrated at tMy mother bought one as well (same time I did) and neither of us are very happy."
2,"Good idea, bad design","I have always wanted a good quality mandoline, but they are usually too expensive when a knife will suffice. Then I saw this one as a ""Gold Box"" special, not only on sale, but at a huge discount! Well, I now know why the price was so great!The first time I used the slicer, it was to thin slice potatoes for a casserole. I inserted the thin ""blade"" (actually just the guide that sits against the fixed blade close enough for thin slices), and easily sliced a whole bowl-ful of potatoes, arranged them in my casserole and popped it into the oven, then went to the sink to clean up... and the ""blade"" wouldn't come out of the slicer.I have pushed and pulled, pinched and squeezed, tapped and tugged, and I still can't get the thing to budge. Since I will most commonly need thin slices, perhaps it is fortunate that I first used the mandoline for that purpose, because it seems I am now stuck with that choice.(By the way... the casserole was delicious!)"
3,So so,"The only thing I find this slicer useful for is thick and thin slicing of onions. This concept is too akward for slicing any other vegetable that is not round. The french-fry cutter and julienne slicers require a lot of arm power and I'm just paranoid that I may cut my finger off. It's still tricky removing the different blades even with previous customer advice of lifting, then pulling. I like the bowl feature since I don't have a lot of counter space and I often end up slicing sitting down on my step stool."
5,"Great Spray, not Mist","Mist sprayers tend to over spray onto floors, table cloths, and stove tops. These work very well. We use one for olive oil, one for balsamic vinegar, and one for ""I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Spray"" for corn on the cob."
3,A review from a true yaoi fan,"Not too bad of a yaoi manga for Yaoipress's first couple releases (they have also released a yaoi manga called ""Pinned!""). My actual rating would be 3 and a half stars if it were possible to give such a rating. Not the best yaoi manga out there, but if you're a hard core yaoi fan, you may enjoy this manga. The art's okay and the story line was entertaining, however, in my personal opinion I was just a little disappointed with the ending, for I thought it had more potential (but that's the way it is for many yaoi mangas). There are some yummy scenes that I'm sure other yaoi fans will appreciate and the bonus story after the main story is humorous. I have to say that I would only recommend this to people who are really into yaoi, though."
2,Not worth it,"This book isn't bad...but then, it isn't great, either. The biggest problem I had with it is that you can't find most of these places; the stories are phrased as, ""In a northeast town long ago..."" or ""...a house north of Decorah...""If you're just sitting down for an enjoyable read, it will do. If you want to actually find these places, go with The Iowa Road Guide to Haunted Locations by Chad Lewis. It gives explicit directions to each site."
1,Picture tube defective after 2 years of use,"The screen comes in with a pink hue and red shading.Panasonic products are supposed to be good, however, over the recent years, I'm seeing more defects.I'm avoiding Panasonic products. I haven't had any luck with them."
4,Kikin!,This Minisystem rocks the house! It can get SO FREAKIN LOUD. The 6 different sound modes really help. The sound are really rich and even at high volumes the quality or the music is still really good. The subwoofer rules! On max you can feel it from the next room. The tape recorder works really well. It will even mark where the different songs start. One bad thing about it is that it takes a little while for it to get a CD to play. And what's the poing of a rolling control panel??? Is it really nesscary? Oh. The last problem is that when on stereo mode it sounds a little fuzzy. So you gotta use mono. Otherwise this system is Kikin!
3,Not quite like pictured,"A great little plant, well protected with packing peanuts and a small heating pad, but no plastic like others had mentioned. Shipped quickly, I would give three and a half stars if I could because its a healthy plant, just not as large or full as the one pictured. I would say my plant is about a third of the size. Excited to see it grow and bloom!"
1,Leaky leaky iron,I was extremely disapointed with this iron I purchased on sale for $19.99. It worked well for about 8 months and then all of a sudden the lower half of the steam holes started spurting water when there was water in the reservoir. It looks more like a water fountain than an iron. I'm throwing it away and looking for another.
2,Its Ok it you dont have anything else to watch,"It was ok, but definitely low budget. The acting was weak but I guess it was entertaining. I was so disappointed when I found out this movie was supposedly based on Brenda Jackson's romance novel ""One Special Moment"". The only thing in the movie that came close to the book was Sterling Hamilton's name. The plot was totally weak and it really didnt have to turn out that way. The director and screenwriters should have been required to read the book before attempting this movie. The book was perfection and would have made a much better movie than this mess being passed off as art. My advice to BET is make sure the people you hire to do you movie arent to lazy to do their homework. This movie is definitely not worth buying....my advice it rent it or wait for it to come on cable, cause it is truly a waste."
3,missing 5 songs from original album,"The original RCA album from 1965 had 14 songs, this CD has only 9. Oddly enough, in 1982 the album was reissued on the Pickwick label using these same 9 cuts and in the same order. And as already noted, this is not a great CD transfer."
1,Absolutely Shameful -- Absolutely Terrible!,"Name a horror film and I've seen it. I love the great ones and love the bad ones, but this wasn't bad -- this was bloody and utterly aweful (the acting, the camera work, the tragically rotten script, the ""special effects"" i.e. a guy in a mask). One of the reviews here is so obviously someone involved with the film that I just had to write this review. And to the actress with the ""British"" accent -- PULEEEZE! Do not rent this movie. Do not buy this movie. Do not even waste your life reading the description on the back of the DVD case. this could be topped by a bunch of high school kids with a free weekend and zero talent."
3,GOOD FIRST EFFORT,"Considering that this is a small-budget independent film by a first-time writer/director, I think it is pretty good. The dialogue is, for the most part, crisp and sometimes, humorous. As for the quality of acting, young actors have to get their start somewhere too. At least it was made on film rather than shot on video giving it much better definition. I look for bigger and better things from this writer/director. Copy and spelling mistakes should be attributed to Artisan, which should be better at proofing. I doubt the producers had much artistic control after the film was sold."
3,You Reap What You Sow......,"For a low budget movie, I did not find this movie as awful as others have. If you have had the misfortune as I have of seeing Dark Harvest 2, you will Really appreciate this movie!! Dark Harvest 2, which I also reviewed is one of the sorriest movies I've ever seen and has nothing to do with this movie. OK horror flick, especially if you like scarecrow movies. To sum it up, a young man inherits a old farm and brings along some friends with him to see if the farmhouse is in good enough condition to be sold. What they do not know is that years ago, a farmer killed his wife and hung her as a scarecrow. Naturally, we see the scarecrow come to life. Taking place deep in the isolated mountains, Dark Harvest has some good/cool scenes. I myself think the scarecrow is rather cool! I'd recommend renting this movie. I think anyone would say.... I've seen much worse!!"
5,Good Singing,"This is a CD of songs that were not necessarily hits by Eddie, except ""Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye"", and yet he sings them the same way he has sung every thing else he's done, in a straightforward and very enjoyable way. This is a good CD and very enjoyable. He was just a good singer, particularly in the 60's and 70's, but always he has been a good singer."
5,Best portable dvd player ever made,"ive owned 2 different panasonic dvd players (L10 and Lv-75) these are the best brand (panasonic) on the market they Never skip even on airplanes! The have great picture quality, 3 different ratios widescreen(16:9), regular(4:3), zoomed in. Dolby digital and DTS outputs and tv connector cables. so this has basically everything you need to use it as portable dvd player and a home dvd player. it also has a 4 hour battery"
4,If you saw the movie,If you saw the movie then you will find this rewarding. If you didn't I think you'd still find it an enjoyable read. Godden writes in a style completely in line with classic British literature of the era.
4,Ella is great - the remastering isn't,"I have this release and the original release of this album, and the mastering is much better in the original. This release loses some of the ambience of the original and bumps up the vocal level a bit. I also feel the extra songs on this release add very little and were not included in the original release for a reason...All this said, Frank deVol's arrangements are great - both witty and sensitive, and OF COURSE, Ella's vocals are absolutley wonderful."
4,works pretty darn good!,works only on 12 oz. cans. if the cans are dented some times they jam. but over all this product preforms very niceley. crush many cans quite fast.
1,Almost ain't good enough...,"Neat idea, poor implementation. ""Luck of the draw"" item. The version we received was built of metal and plastic. Surprise Surprise - plastic part (back of ram) broke - after 33 crushes. Can chute flimsy, crusher assembly half-flimsy. Misfed on virgin cans 3 or 4 times. Failed to drop crushed cans about a third of the time. Returned."
1,CAN RAM ALUMINUM CAN CRUSHER,Unit is a piece of junk. Bought 2 units brand new. Tried to put first unit basket together and plastic cracked. Sold off both units online for $9. The first unit got returned and the second unit person wanted to return because said did not work. After that I was done. Really like the concept but cans are difficult to crush.
5,Great planner!,"I bought this book at borders, and should have bought here at amazon. When I saw it I knew it was the book I was looking for. I was shopping around trying to find the right book to help me, and this one was it. The book is large with lots of extra space to add pages. The book is very informative and really helps me get organized. The timeline was really helpful to get things in perspective for me. Before I bought it, I started freaking out because I thought I had to get everything done right now! So to sum up, the book is really helping me stay organized, gives lots of extra information, and is large with extra space."
2,Not the greatest... for me.,"I was looking for this binder to really help organize me and I didn't feel like it did so much. It is just a binder with some pockets in it, but it didn't give me any ideas on how to organize. If you're one to go through magazines and do a lot of clipping and searching of pictures, this binder might be great, but I already had a good idea of what I wanted so I didn't do all of that. I had a good idea of what I wanted, i just needed help organizing everything."
2,"Bulky, difficult to use","This was a very difficult book to use- its very pretty but impractical- the folders are useles because things slip out easily- dont even think about keeping receipts in there!Also, the pages did not flip easily and the hole puncher was kind of cheap and flimsy. I would recomment the Ultimate Wedding Workbook & organizer over this one any time! I bought that one and was quite satisfied!"
2,Not Completely Satisfied....,"I consider this planner / organizer ""okay"" for basic information but, felt a little unfulfilled as far as obtaining more essential information to planning weddings. Another planner / organizer from the same publishing company, ""The Very Best Wedding Planner and Organizer,"" is comprised of more information than the aforementioned organizer."
4,It seems to work fine,"When my old grill regulator died I wanted a regulator with a hose that was longer than the 18"" one on the grill because it was hard to change out the gas bottle. I could not source a longer one locally and found this one on Amazon at a reasonable price. I only gave it four stars because we only used it for a few weeks before we got a new Weber grill so i can't address its long term durability. But from what I did see it seemed to be a quality product and it worked."
2,not that great,I have to get your box number reset every times. by sending them an email. can be a hassle. reboot your computer. then download video and type your number on the box. every 2 times u do that u have to get it reset. or it will say u ran out of activations on your box number. hassle in witch getting it reset. but other wise it been a good software. needs to be updated from website because the old version on disc dosent recog the Ipod. this software if ok. but can make me pissy. because I erase my my computer a lot. resetig can be a hassle. I bot 40.00. but it will do the job. for what ever hassle it maybee. I sold my ipod so I wont use it now. after so many months of not using it your box number will expire. and it no good any more. there are ways of complaining by email & getting that fixed
1,Terrible,"One of the worst newspapers in the country. Very little original content, mostly cust and paste from other sources and usually a day or two late at that."
2,Back to 1990's Usenet,"I tried the sample, and the presentation does not appear to have improved since F. Hewett's review. It had the feel of news feeds from 1990's Usenet - plain test, no tables, charts, imaqes, etc. Other Kindle-ized papers include these items, so it is very disappointing that the paper from the ""Silicon Hills"" has not entered the 21st century."
1,Also disappointed,"I have to agree with a previous review, this book is a disappointment. This book falls somewhere between a blog post and a sophomore CS student term paper. They even pulled that old slightly larger font trick to thicken this book.The code is so ridiculously simple, repetitive, and inefficient that its almost tedious to read through. I understand the code isn't focused, but their should at least be some logical code. Example after example is so repetitive you really only need to read the first one from each chapter. The chapter on nusoap is literally 3 or 4 pages long and an example of 5 lines of code.You can find plenty of free resources online that do a better job explaining these theories easier. No need to waste your time or money here."
3,Loud.,This unit seems to work well put when you play a tape the VCR sound is VERY loud and distracting.
2,Not about Organic Gardening,"After reading the excepts about the divine creative energies, I guess my imagination told me that this book was about organic gardening, it isn't. The recommendations are to treat your soil with several steps beginning with soft rock phosphate, then high calcium lime, then others such as copper or iron sulfate. The author further states that that because our soil is soooo depleted, that organic amendments really don't change the soil much and your best bet is to use a combination of organic and synthentic amendments. Personally I was looking for organic methods only and was disappointed."
4,Baller,"this game had some scratches but still works and was worth the money. Came early too,anyways i recommend any other person to buy from here."
1,Too bad there's no negative stars for this one!,"For the record- I don't listen to rap & I'm not into the hiphop lifestyle. Maybe people who are into those things might like this game better...I'm just going off of the gameplay.This game is just horrible (just like 80% of game releases based on a movie or celebrity), by far one of the worst releases all year. The character movements are really clunky & the levels are extremely repetative. Absolutely nothing original about it.This game wasn't even worth the rental on my gamepass. I feel really bad for the people who got suckered into buying it.Bottom line- if you're into action shooters...stay far far away. Not even a worthy rental. Don't waste your time unless you are into bland games!"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"This is the worst product. What a dissappointment from a quality known brand. This does not steam at all not to mention, completely cumbersome to use."
3,you'll never walk alone,"good elvis album if you like the music from the end of the 60's elvis made.It's not his best work, it's more an album for the real die hard fans."
4,Great for guests,"We bought this to replace an areobed we had for 8+ years because we lost the pump. Good news is this areobed has the pump built in so you will never loose it. It fills in 60 seconds (I counted) and deflates in 60 seconds too. It comes with a felt top and an additional cotton cover and overall is quick and comfortable.The only thing we don't like is that you need to keep it plugged in to deflate it and when you roll it up, some air is still stuck in the nooks so you need to push the deflate button a few times while you roll it up. This also prevents you from rolling it up as the manufacture suggests, with the pump in the middle to protect it. Still a good buy!"
4,Recessed pump????,"I have owned several of these mattresses, and found them to be very comfortable. I have trouble with pressure points and this is the only type mattress I can sleep on. I now need a new one and can not find the words RECESSED PUMP in the description! I can't order it if this is not so, because it will not fit the bed!Can anyone tell me if this model has a recessed pump? I called amazon and they can't give me any more info than what's on the website.Thanks"
5,Super easy and comfortable,"Using a twin on the top and the full on the bottom as mattresses for a vacation home bunk bed, super easy to setup and guests love it."
1,tons of leaks only months after purchase,"This product is horrible. At first, everything seemed to work fine. But then, several months after purchase, I got my first leak. The first problem with the leak is that it was on the felt side, not the smooth vinyl side so the patches that Aerobed supplied did not work. I had to go to a camping store to find a liquid vinyl repair kit and that worked. But leaks kept coming... finally, 9 months into owning this bed... some internal structures gave way with what sounded like a ripping sound and one end blew up like a balloon leaving the other end sagging to the ground... and, sadly, making the bed unsleepable.This product is not worth the money. Do not buy it."
4,Comfortable Sleeping on Air,"This mattress inflates with an electric control. You shouldn't stand on this as it may decrease in air volume, however, I've had it for about four weeks and found I only have to reinflate every week or so."
1,Uncomfortable,I have a queen size Aerobed that is sooo much more comfortable than this twin size. It holds up well but it is very uncomfortable.
4,Comfortable,This is a great guest bed that stores in little space when not in use. The only flaw is the fact that one has to hold a button on the controller to deflate the bed. The older model just had a valve to release.
2,agree with other reveiws..and,"please authors, do your research. This book was supposed to take place in 1812 and the heroine is reading Pride and Prejudice by her favorite author, Jane Austen, which, a) wasn't published until 1813, and b) Jane wrote anonymously!!! her name did not appear in the original publications. It just said, by the author of Sense and Sensibility. GRRRRRRR"
5,Historical Romances Fan,I LOVED THIS BOOK I FALL IN LOVE WITH THE CHARACTERS THEY ARE SO REAL ANYONE READING THIS BOOK WILL ENJOY THE CHARACTERS AND THE STORY LINE I RECOMMENDED THIS BOOK
5,Love this book,"This book is very sturdy, full of colorful graphics, and has a lot of flaps to open and explore. Highly recommended!"
4,"A very good book, intended for an ""intermediate"" audience.","For students of all things sartorial, who have progressed beyond the basic primers offered by Flusser, Boyer, and others, ""The Elegant Man"" is a must have. While the book is by no means perfect (none of the current available crop of men's clothing treatises are), it is the only widely available work that examines areas such as fabric type with anything besides a cursory glance. If you are an MBA grad still trying to figure out what suit to wear to an interview, or a ""Dress for Success"" type, then this probably isn't the book for you; however, if you have read Flusser and Boyer's books, and want to learn a little more, then I think you might enjoy the level of detail and more narrowly focused viewpoint provided by ""The Elegant Man""."
4,Pleasantly Pleased,"So far, I am pleased with Meinl drum products. Great instrument, with a nice sound. I bought this drum for my son, and loves them. He says they are amazing with a nice sounding bass."
3,Not 100%,"Switch works good with Windows XP but will not work with Windows Vista on a Dell Inspiron 530.To be fair, I need to give it some stars because it seems to work OK for other people. I now have two other switches on my shelf that will not work. I get the error message where the computer does not recognize the switch on Vista."
5,Very pleased with purchase,"I have two computers set up side by side in my home with only one printer. This USB switch did the trick. It was inexpensive, easy to set up, and easy to use. You just need to press the button on top to switch printing from one computer to printing from the other."
3,It's nice movie,"Flavors rises gallantly to the challenge, and hardly struggles in its quest, despite the handicap of being strikingly nice.The film opens with a wedding.' These are ominous words for Indian cinema being made for/in the West, since we have been constantly bombarding world cinema with shaadis, be it beginning, culmination, or entire plot of a seemingly camcorder-held film."
2,Not to Great,I am not a big fan of tv/vcr combos. This product is a reason why. The screen is way to small to adaquetly show almost any picture. I would go with a bigger tv and vcr if I were you.
1,low quality,"it was cool for a while, but eventually the metal that holds the knife just plain cracked off one time when i was trying to cut something and the knife folded open past where it should go. now its useless."
3,Really quite large and awkward,"I actually found that this peeler was quite large and awkward to hold in my hand. The handle would've been better with a rubber grip, too. I'm really surprised that so many people found this peeler so easy to hold, but maybe it's because I have small hands. I gave it three stars, though, because the blade IS really nice and sharp especially compared to the other similarly priced peelers I've purchased at WalMart."
3,Cool Tricks but ANNOYING music,"It was a largely underwater magic show. The promotional bits, music, and Penn's voice were annoying.Some traditional illusions, performed underwater. They did a ""pick a card"" trick with a surprisingly large number of people at the beach. One of the underwater illusions was timed to Aaron Carter's singing (also annoying, but less so than the commercial break music). One of the coolest bits had Teller straitjacketed and shut in a box, to be lowered into shark infested waters. There was even a trick involving trained dolphins.The big finish was making a real submarine disappear before a large audience of divers.If you get this DVD, you should probably fast-forward through the promos, as they are really annoying, particularly the music."
4,What we should all know,This book is a wealth of knowledge that explains the healthiest and best ways to combat and prevent all sorts of illnesses and problems. I have found it to be one of the best sources of useful tidbits in a long while. I am a very health concious person and this book has taught me more in just a few chapters than I had known previously
5,Perfect color regardless of light source,"I have taken portraits and product shots in the kitchen, bathroom, office, auditorium, stadium, sunset and managed to get pretty much an accurate color. The most difficult part was for me to learn to use it and now I don't have to do any color correction"
5,I love this clock!!,This Celtic clock was just right for me. I like how big the numbers are and it adds an antique flavor to my room. The back of the clock does stick out so it won't be completely flat against the wall but it looks just fine for me.
4,I like the product in general.,"My house has a high ceiling with par20 bulbs and outdoor lamps with par 30 long necks. I have had no major problems with this kit. It works as stated. Unfortunately I wish the kit came with a broken lightbulb adapter or CFL bulb adapter, but it's a minor quibble. The other adapters can be bought seperately, which I think I'll do later."
3,Fair!,This is the first of beverly jenkin's books that I have read. I am giving it three stars for that purpose only. It was a well written book with a lot of factual details...
4,Good value for the money,We have multiple gerbils in a single cage so they can go through bedding fairly quickly. This lasts a very long time and was a better value than buying locally.
4,Smells bad when wet,"I do not like the way this stuff smells when it gets wet- like wet dirty newspaper! I now mix it with soft wood chips and it works great for my bunny, absorbs well."
3,Odd smell,"I purchased the same brand of litter but a different color at the pet store where we got our guinea pig. It was great, but expensive. So I decided to purchase this stuff on amazon for less. It is the same stuff, but it has a really odd (and not good) smell. Not sure why."
3,Nice bedding but pricey over time,"This is nice soft bedding, and our guinea pigs seem to like it just fine, but it gets expensive when it needs to be replaced every week. For this reason, we've decided to switch to fleece bedding that can be washed-- better for the planet too, and there won't be little pieces of litter on the floor."
4,the Recorder Guide: An Instruction Method for Soprano and Alto,A good resource/instruction guide for the beginner to hone one's skills. Could be a resource for the student of the flute.
4,Best price and pretty good shipping,"Ever since Postum disappeared, we're satisfied our craving for a hot drink with Pero which is not a bad substitution. I hear Postum is back but priced two or three times reasonable so we'll stick with Pero."
5,Pero,"We love the taste of Pero. It is the perfect substitute for coffee with or without cream. We recommend it highly to anyone who wants to give up coffee and the caffeine associated with it, but wants to enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning or any other time during the day."
5,Hot Drink,"This is the best non-caffinated hot drink I have found! It dissolves quickly, has a roasted aroma and can even be substituted for coffee in recipes. Try it at a 1/2 teaspoon as well as a full teaspoon to adjust the amount of flavor you like. I bought a case - it's the cheapest and I will always have it on hand. It is an excellent gift as well."
5,humdinger,Pero is a wonderful substitute for coffee. I discovered it a couple of years ago and was so happy to find it on Amazon.com at a very reasonable price. I definitely recommend it to others looking for a coffee substitute.
5,Great price,"It's hard to find an affordable container of Pero, so this was just perfect. You can drink it any time of the day or night & it doesn't interfere w/sleep."
5,pero coffee substitue,Excellent product great taste. Non caffinated is one of the biggest reasons for buying this product.Thank you
1,Razr V3xx Holster,Razr V3xx slides in very easily - but the downside it that it slides out just as easily! You can neither swivel the phone nor bend down to pick something up without the phone sliding out the top. I am on my fourth holster for this phone - so far all do not prevent the phone from falling out the top.I had a Razr V3 and the swivel holster that looks like a triangle secures the phone at the top - the phone faces in and clips in and out easily. Holster was perfect but unfortunately they don't make this style for the V3xx.
2,Came with unglued tuning stem,Super glue fixed it...inexpensive but I would have bought an American product for double the price if I had known more about dulcimers and their various qualities. I will use it as a wall hanger and get an American made dulcimer instead since I hate to waste my time. The uncertain tone means hard to tune and the strings are VERY cheap and fragile and I am afraid to tune it as I do not want to restring this one to just sit it on the wall..
3,Not quite what I had hoped,"I was a little disappointed with this product. I had assumed that some sort of ""necklace"" would come with it. When I viewed the picture with the chain, my brain didn't comprehend 'charm' without chain. It is also of lighter weight that anticipated. I've wanted to wear it several times but cannot as the ""necklace"" is missing."
4,Wonderful product,"I have this in the standard size and will be buying this King Size. I have used the standard size for headaches, neckaches, and sore back muscles. It is a wonderful moist heat product. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because I wish the technology was there to hold the heat in a little longer than it does. Microwave it for 2 minutes initially and it will hold the heat from 5 to 15 minutes....stays warm after that, but does lose the heat. The thing I like about it though is that I don't have to worry about falling asleep with a heating pad on. Even if some of them do have auto shut-off....you're still depending on an electrical unit."
5,The best Mariachi music,"One of my favorite things to do in Mexico is sit in a local small-town plaza and listen to the mariachis. Sometimes the bands are really bad, but the out-of-tune sounds still add to the party atmosphere. This CD, however, is terrific. Excellent musicians, great sounds, a multitude of fun songs."
3,Evan's Gate,"This new novel in the series by Rhys Bowen provides an intriguing mystery, liberally sprinkled with the characters which longtime readers have come to know & love. This series is set in modern day North Wales & all the titles playfully refer to the main character, Evan Evans, a police officer who has moved from being the village bobbie to the post of Detective Constable. Evan is involved in investigating two disappearances, both of young blonde girls, twenty-five years apart. The reader is pulled willingly along as the mysteries are unwound."
4,This is the first Patricia Grasso novel I read,I'm not going to recap the whole storyline of this novel since it has already been done by other reviewers. I can understand why some people were annoyed in the beginning by the male behavior in the book. I don't think her brother inlaws behavior was really all that bad I mean family members tend to tease each other. I hate to say it but her betrothed's behavior at the beginning of the book was probably a more accurate account of how men viewed and treated their wives during the regency period. I think the author could have explained more about what happened between his father and Victoria's father to make it a more stand alone book. Obviously one must read the other two in the series to find out what went down. I have to say though once I got to the middle of the book when his illegitimate children begin to show up I couldn't put the book down. I ended up staying up most of the night to finish it. I can't wait to go back and read other Grasso novels.
5,ENJOYABLE!,"To Catch A Countess is an enjoyable book. Victoria is wonderful, and the author has her ""problem"" down pat. She is dyslexic and the author got it right. The hero is a handsome, arrogant, and then sensitive man who learns a hard lesson. The villains, hero's half-sister and her sister-in-law, were deliciously evil. A pretty good book to lose yourself in and escape stresses. I RECOMMEND BUYING IT"
5,A Great Help!,"From a teacher who doesn't always know what to say. The notes are clear and direct, important in communication."
1,Never got this item,I had bought this item for my dad for Christmas and it never came. So then I had wrote the company and they never wrote back and I still haven't heard from them and I never received it. I would never buy form here again. I learned my lesson for shopping online.
3,Farmed Salmon or Wild ?,3 Starred it because I'm just asking a question.Anyone know if these are made from Farmed Salmon or Wild? I don't want my dogs eating Farmed Salmon which I suspect these are made from. Wild would be too costly.
3,"Looks like a good product, but I won't purchase again.","The smell is very enticing to my two dogs, but quite objectionable to my husband. I gave half a treat to both dogs and my shepherd mix threw up within minutes of eating it. I'm not sure if it was the treat, but I'm a bit hesitant to try it again."
5,Best band you've never heard of,"All great bands start somewhere. This duo got it's start in Winston-Salem NC and is America's next big thing. Great rock sound with some spooky bass, just in time for Halloween. They have been on tour at small venues all summer and are just waiting to be discovered. I'll give them until December 2008 before they get an offer from a major label."
3,Break in,"Shoes fit my foot but I will need to break them in, originally thought I could wear straight out of box"
2,Okay for TV movie,"First off I don't know how I ended up with this movie. I thought I ordered the theatrical version of The Phantom. It's okay for a three hour TV flic, though. Easy to see what was going to happen though. Also, you can't just watch the movie straight through. You have to watch it in two parts which are on the same disc. Why? Just because that's the way it was shown on TV? This is one purchase I will donate to the local library."
3,Another near miss,Lee Falk created the Phantom and movie makers have tried repeatedly to destroy it. They are getting better at ruining a classic.
5,Awesome movie!!!!!,"I love this movie so much!!! It's great action and an incredibly moving story that is brilliantly acted by Ryan Carnes. This is definitely my new favorite movie. So good for comic book buffs, which I'm not at all so it's also just great for everyone!"
1,Action? If you say so,"There's so much to rant about this game, but if I start I'll never stop. I have never given up on a game so fast before. You play an assassin who has to spend all his time with his head bowed because the moment you try to have any fun the guards show up and chase you down. This game punishes you for trying to have fun, there's no other way to put it. AC suffers from what a lot of games do now, pretty graphics but a boring game. If you want to have fun pulling off all the free running that was shown in the trailer, go play Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time for the PS2."
2,Booorrrringgg,"This is a beautiful game indeed. I didn't mind the premise of genetic time tavel, and you do spend most of your time in the Crusades rather than the lab ""back home."" The repetition of the missions is inexcusable. Take a lesson from the Splinter Cell series (also Ubisoft) and challenge us with stealth and assassination rather than having us simply wash, rinse, and repeat. Not enough new abilities, fighting techniques, or strategy imparted after each mission.There is some openness to the environment, but how many times can you rescue the same old lady?"
4,Assassin's Creed - The true nextgen experience,"First off..... Awesome game!! Totally awesome game. Ubisoft has taken what most call a gamble with this game and it has paid off and then some. The fact that you can pretty much do whatever you want in this game (non-linear gameplay) is what makes this game a shining start. The controls are good, graphics awesome and a very very good storyline. If you play this game the way it is meant to be played and not rush through it you will have no regrets. From assassinations, chases through streets and on buildings, the leap of faith. Assassin's Creed was asked to deliver and it did and then some. Only thing I have noticed is that it does get a tad bit repetitive at times but it's nothing major that's why I give this game a 9 out of 10.Assassin's Creed - The true nextgen experience!!!"
3,"Redundant, Yet Addictive","I've played two levels of the game so far, so maybe it will change. But I've found the game to be a bit boring, yet ... I can't quit playing. The graphics are great, the player movement is great (climbing, jumping, etc.). But I find myself doing the same stuff, over and over, climb to a tower, go and pickpocket/eavesdrop or something, then rescue an innocent civilian from evil soldiers. Climb a new tower, and ... do the same stuff again.But like I said, it's addictive, I can't wait to keep going in the game and see what happens next. I also intend to buy Assasins Creed 2, which is why I'm even playing the first game in the first place. This is almost like an orientation, or doing background research."
3,The others are better,Ive played every ac game and I think this one is the worst. Its not bad but its not really good either. The legend that is altair deserved a better game.
2,9 missions. Every one exactly the same as the last one.,"The game is boring... I finished it and all, and it does have an interesting story (I mean like the one that's happening in the near future with Desmond), but every mission is exactly the same, aaaall 9 of 'em over and over. I'd recommend you buy it only so you know that background story for the AC II (a MUCH better game)"
4,Be Patient,"The game starts kind of slow but it picks later on. In order to get to the fun you have to get through some boring parts. However,when it finally does take of it is alot of fun and it will keep you ocupied for some time."
2,"Great graphics, terrible game","The only good thing Assassin's Creed had going for it was the graphics. I can count on one hand the games I've started and never finished and Assassin's Creed is one of them. While the gameplay at first is dynamic, after getting to the second city/area you realize how MONOTONOUS this game really is. The same setup for each city/area, the same quests, and the same background noises (my bf had to leave the room).I only played this game for a total of about 3-4 hours before I had to stop. I cannot stand a game that has 5+ different collections of 1,000 items (coins, flags, whatever) and NO good plot going for it. Why must I collect 1,000 flags on the side in addition to the boring quests? Maybe the plot got better, who knows. I wasn't willing to stick around for it though."
4,No Gamer Should Do Without This Title in His or Her Collection,Each AC game got better and better as the series progressed and each game is essential to understanding the enormous story that unfolds within this series. Anyone looking for hours and hours of fun with a compelling and often confusing story that will keep you guessing should pick this title up immediately. (along with the rest of the series)
2,Quit half way through.,"Game only makes it half way before it says to clean the disk.I've tried cleaning it multiple times, but nothing works."
2,Great for an hour - boring for 12 more,"I'll get this out there - this is a beautiful, expansive game with huge potential and ubi did an amazing job with it. Play it for an hour and you'll think you've got something very special. The problem is that the beauty is only skin deep, and once you get into it the game is devastatingly boring. It is simply the same thing over and over. The stealth mechanics are broken and you spend far too much time on trial and error. The story isn't bad, but most people will never finish the game. Truthfully I am sorry I wasted my time with it - maybe the sequel will be an improvement, but do yourself a favor and buy the orange box or a $10 copy of Crackdown instead."
1,Disappointment,"I was looking foward to getting this game I had dreams about it. When I finally did buy it; I was so disappointed with it. Graphics nice, gameplay nice, and killing the targets was great. But the game so repetive it put me to sleep. You have to spend a ton of time walking, staying hidden, and when you do kill your target; everybody and their momma is out to kill you. That is the most frustrating (sucks the fun out of it) part of the game. What is worse is I figured out the ending before I was on third target. You are a puppet (just like Metal Gear Solid-following order without question) and that ruined everything I liked about the game. Do not buy this game. I felt I was robbed of sixty dollars and I did not bother to trade it in because I did not want someone else to buy this crap game. So I did the smartest thing; I threw it in the trash."
3,Annoying player controls,"It was ok, but frankly my dude kept getting caught up on various things and doing totally nonsensical moves because of, what I'm assuming, must be tags in the terrain that something is a handhold, or a ledge, or whatever. But I'd be like trying to jump into a haystack or something and the dude's just like totally standing there like a freaktard."
4,Entertaining but a little repetitive.,"Overall Assassins Creed was a great experience. The graphics were outstanding and really showed how great they were when climbing high above a city or village. The gameplay was good overall. Sometimes that battling could get repetitive. You really only use one button to attack and whether you defend yourself depends on the timing of pulling the right trigger. I would have like to have seen something a little more complex, but this got the job done and kept me intrigued with the game until the end. I would recommend this game to people to play and beat there really is no replay value once you beat the game. That is unless you are a person that has to finish a game to 100% instead of just the story line. If you finish the game completely you will be spending countless hours searching for flags in the different cities and kingdoms. But once again this game is worth buying and playing. Cant wait to get my hands on the second one."
3,Pretty but dull.,"You want to love this game, but you can't. On the surface it looks fantastic but there is no endearing qualities below the surface. Look at the game from a summer blockbuster movie perspective and you may enjoy it a little more, very pretty but no substance.Relish your first assassination, because after that the game is the same for the other eight kills. If the game was not touted to the customer as next gen, I would be okay with it. This game would not look out of place on the Xbox: however, I expect more from a Xbox 360 game. Look at BioShock it is amazing!Buyer beware.BioShockElder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Game of the Year Edition"
3,razo shift knob,"This is a nice product and I`m sure that it is a quality unit. Unfortunately it was not adaptable to my 2012 Fiat 500. The inserts were all for threaded shafts,and the Fiat has a non threaded shaft. There were no adaptors for this shaft so it is basically useless for me."
2,Not well packaged.,"Very disappointed that when we received this, they had the wing done in such a way that the packaging stuck to it when you tried to open it. Very cheaply made to begin with, and that just added to our disappointment of the product. For $6 ($60% off). If I had paid the original $15 asking price I'd be quite upset with the quality of product and packaging. I wasn't expecting it to look authentic, but paper stuck to the wing in a way that you cannot take off was a little much."
5,"A well-written, thought provoking novel","I have read this book at least fifty times, and it's one of which I never tire. I have recommended it to countless friends and have received only favorable comments. Despite the far-fetched (hopefully!) story, the teenaged characters are very real, as are the struggles they face. When I was twelve, I wanted to have them all as my best friends."
1,Horrible! Ground this Book!,"Five teens are sent with a chaperone into the wilderness to be killed. Their parents in effect hired a hit man. The most unappealing character was Marigold with her tiresome ""Moi"" bit. This is a horrible story!"
5,Haste the f...in day,"boy this is one of the best hardcore metal bands around, I just found out about them on this years Headbangers ball c.d. and I love their c.d.'s. I can't wait for more stuff by them in the future even though Jimmy Ryan is gone. Awesome stuff if you're into as I lay dying, from autumn to ashes, Ligeia etc... rock on."
4,Not to bad for rookies!,This cd is good for a begining band! They can scream to sing to scream again! The drum and guiter work is great. Its great to hear somebody from my area of where I live which is in Indy that can actually rock you! Its not the best I've ever heard in the metal scene but its a really good cd for a band that has never released a full length cd. I was impressed but I can see alittle room for improvement. Thats ok though there young! They have a full career ahead of them! Oh also kotos to the the art work also it looks nice! Check them out there on tour all year and look for them on Headbangers Ball w/there forth coming vedio for the Closet Thing To Clouser.
4,Reall Good,"This is really good thrashy hardcore metal, ala a combo of norma Jean, ZZZZZZao and Dead Poetic. Plus the cover art is cool. Scream along."
4,Excellent overview and explanation of Verilog 2001,"This book provides an excellent overview an explanation of the new Verilog 2001 features, the rationale for each new feature, and examples."
5,Great Product,This machine is efficent and works very well in a small space. Def. a product to have at home or the office.
2,Off to a good start... then crashes,"I picked up this game rather late: I have given up on keeping ahead with computer upgrades, I just want to settle for games that run well on my current hardware. Tron 2.0 does and a few years down the road, it was very cheap to buy.This game got off to a great start, it was great fun submerging in the world of Tron, a truly different experience from your regular shooter. Unfortunately, when I was finally introduced to the light cycles (only the second level), the game kept crashing hard on my Windows XP system. It took the entire computer with it and did a hard reboot (my system is configured NOT to do that ever). I am running the latest Tron patch, it doesn't seem to make any difference. I tried and tried but after hard reboots 5 times in a row (all in the light cycles practise arena), I was forced to give up and stop playing this game.A real shame... I would have loved to see what is beyond this level, but I simply can't reach it."
4,Great game! plenty of variety! Well excuted on every level.,"Truly immersive, I found myself wanting more even after playing it all the way to conclusion. It boasts all the great first person shooter elements: Featuring a great story line, atmosphere, graphics, music, sound and most importantly top notch game play.It succeeds in capturing the verve and theme of the original 80's cult classic and, dare I say it, surpasses it.The variety of multiplayer modes are also very well done."
5,Crisp Clean Fragrance That Gentlemen Notice,"Tresor has been my fragrance of choice for many years. I received this gift set for Mother's Day. The shower gel has a richness, similar to a body latte foam. The lotion caresses your skin with an aroma of sensual bliss. The perfume is just the most perfect I have ever found. Strangers .. men and women alike have stopped me to inquire what fabulous perfume I am wearing. Gentlemen, this gift set is a home run ... for any lady in your life."
3,"Cute, but not too user-friendly","This clock is a very cute wall decoration for my young granddaughter, but the hands are quite difficult to see (curved and pastel - fade into the picture). I doubt she can see them well enough to learn to tell time with them. If I had actually seen the clock close up before purchasing, I probably would have passed on it."
3,Bought for school,"This book couldn't hold my attention for more than a few minutes at a time. It was super boring. I did a group project on the Aymara, which was really interesting and this book was packed with great information, but to sit down and read it through is nearly impossible. Throw in some mountain ninjas or something to keep the readers attention, who cares if it's not true? Haha, j/k."
3,The Circle Opens,"This is an exciting and fast-paced book set in the province Emelan, where Sandry now lives with her great-uncle Duke Vedris. She meets Pasco Acalon, a boy who can dance magic. But unfortunately, Pasco's family do not approve of this branch of magic and it is up to Sandry to teach him. They end up fighting the Dihanurs, who are trying to kill Duke Vedris and all Rokats in Summersea. Sandry weaves a magical web and Pasco has to use his powerful dance magic....."
3,Dissapointing,"I lovedlovedLOVED the COM books, and I have been waiting for ages for the sequels to come out. Unfortunately, I was sorely dissapointed. This books is so short! It almost seems as if Tammy couldn't be bothered to write it - perhaps she was recovering from Squire - or perhaps she has a new over-zealous editor.The Circle of Magic books were all about character, which is one of the things Tammy is best at. They were exciting and pacey enough to keep you reading, but there was time for just joking among friends and stuff too. Pasco wasn't developed at all as far as I could tell.Still, it was nice to see Sandry again, and I look forward to the others in the series. Hopefully they'll be better, because up until now, Tammy has been a consistantly great writer."
3,Well.....,"I must admit, it was a pretty good book. I'm a bit bias because I don't think that any of her new books have reached the peak that the Immortals series and Song of the Lioness series did, but if you like the Circle of Magic books, you'll like this one too."
4,good book,"I love any book by Tamora Pierce. This series is good and if it was by any other author I would call it great. However, since I have such high expectations for Tamora Pierce I cannot call it truly wonderful."
1,Yuck,"These gumballs are incredibly hard and nearly impossible to chew. The taste is gross, and the only good news is that the taste doesn't last very long. Good concept, poor execution."
2,Classic Nora- but not her best,"I have always loved Nora Roberts and have read her for many years, but this is certainly one of her older pieces of work and not her best. I bought both books in the series and wish I hadn't. It is most certainly Nora, just not her best work. She hit her stride in the 90's and I feel this work (unable to tell when this was published on the kindle) was from the 80's."
5,Nero Wolfe Compilation,"This was a present for my wife and in her words ""absolutely brilliant"". Arrived before the estimated date so well done."
5,love the series,"I love the Nero Wolfe Series. good music, well done. stayed as close to the books. lots of theater.Very Happy. I got a good price too!!!"
2,Definitely Not One of Jacqueline Baird's Better Ones...,"I'm a huge fan of some of JB's books, but believe me, this isn't 1 of 'em! The whole storyline's quite unrealistic even by romance book standard, & the hero seems quite 1 dimensional, insensitive, & cruel until near the very end! If U want a really good one by this author, try ""Marriage at His Convenience"" or ""The Reluctant Fiancee""!"
5,"Delta 9, the BEST Hardcore out there!","Delta 9, in my opinion, is the best hardcore group in the hardcore scene. This music is not stop hardness, gurranteed to keep atleast your foot tapping. If you are hyperactive, like me, then you will become extremely hyper. This CD is one of my favorites. Also, I think that this is the hardest techno anywhere. The only person harder is Ron D. Core, but Delta 9 actually has beat, Ron D. Core is mostly noise, atleast the songs I heard. This is a CD to add to any hardcore techno fans' collection. The best songs are Tough Guy, Phreaked, War, Hardcore Chicago, Hardcore Chicago (Remix), and Buried Alive."
3,Neither a great movie nor a bad one.,I've got this movie at a bargain price from Nehaflix. The leading lady of this Indian movie is another Miss Word from India (Diana Hayden 1997). This is not a great movie but it's worth watching. The taboo kissing is transgressed in this Indian movie. I'm glad to have this movie because Diana Hayden made only a few ones.
2,Not Enough There,"I was very curious to see this movie because, I read an very good review on the movie, I think it said something like ""if this movie does not make you stand up and be pride, then you do not need to stand"", or something like that. But, this movie was not complete. What did Sonny do with his life after he left jail? No one knows, because the movie was not completed. DO not waste your time buying or seeing it."
2,"No leg curl, no manual","This item says it has a 'leg curl / leg extension' mechanism. I can't for the life of me figure out how I'm supposed to do a leg curl -- the leg extension is on the chart of exercises that came with it, but the leg curl is not, and I don't see how you'd do them. There's no belt you could use for the ""seated leg curl"".There's also no manual that came with this item, at least in my box. Just the assembly instructions (which were quite good, and assembly was easy), and the chart.It was easy to set up, and I like using it, so it gets those two stars. But I can't do the leg curls it implied I'd be able to do, it came with no manual, nor any suggested workouts, so it loses stars for that.I'd return it if it weren't more trouble to repack than it's worth. But do yourself a favor and pay the extra for the low-end real Bowflex rather than this 'Schwinn Force by Bowflex'."
3,"Nifty, slickly made film noir from the forties.","This is definitely one of Ladd's better films. It is as good as the 1935 Glass Key (Edward Arnold-George Raft). One amusing aspect of this film: many of the characters wear deadpan smiles throughout the film as though they were the cat that ate the canary. Among the supporting cast Joseph Calleia and William Bendix stand out as a clever, scheming gangster and his sadistic thug bodyguard. 3 1/2 stars."
1,"Unnatural Obsession from ""Brother Richard""","Well I just read ""Brother Richard's"" reviews, and it seems you have a strange obsession with slamming Christianity. If you choose not to believe, that's your right, but why the obsession? Why all the venom? It seems like there is more to this story.I've noticed ""free thinkers"" such as you seem to be big on tolerance for everyone except Christians. I've also learned over the years that when someone exhibits such venom towards Christianity, there is something very wrong below the surface - usually a serious sin issue, or a fear deep down that Christians are right and someday the person will have to face God..."
4,Funky twist!,"Another great book from Ms. Caldwell- I am really loving her books lately. Sometimes just too many details for my taste, but I have to say she's creative at least! This book even has a really funky twist you would never guess. It threw me at first but actually helped the author make her point. Emjoy!"
2,Where is a chick lit novel with heart AND plot?,"It seems like every chick lit genre novel I pick up anymore is more plot-driven than character-driven, and this one is no exception.It had a whimsical angle which I thought was different and intersting at the outset, but soon it was apparent how it was going to play out.Don't bother."
4,Another interesting Caldwell book,"Laura Caldwell definitely has a certain style to her books. I like that her characters are always smart and not ditzy chick lit girls. When Billy gets everything she wants, life is supposed to be perfect, right? The only thing was, Billy's ""problems"" weren't really so big, and it was kind of hard to have sympathy for a woman who seemed to have it all and yet wanted even more. The changes that take place to make her life perfect aren't monumental, and her revelation after the fact wasn't huge. But I liked the ""fantasy"" element of this story and didn't find it all distracting, and Caldwell is a wonderful writer who knows how to paint a picture."
1,"This book needs to be under the religion, ""Christianity"".","A great book for all those so called messianics and Hebrew Chistians that sypathize with people such as Rev. and Mrs. Beresford. Please be sure to note that this is a ""Christian"" book and no way should be classified as ""Jewish""."
5,Fascinating Work!,"This is a fascinating work on the Gospel of Mark and is very well written. The critical form and literary criticism of the scriptural text as well as the details involved regarding the formation of ""households"" in the early Church are the basis for this stunningly well crafted overview of the Gospel of Mark. The references and sources listed are outstanding. It is a thorough and enjoyable as well as a fresh and exciting review of the earliest and first Gospel."
2,Recomend Do NOT Buy!! - Love Color Hate Function - Trouble with DVD,This is one of the cutest products and my wife had to have for our twin daughters. It has been nothing but trouble. You have to place the TV in dvd mode for the dvd to run and so we have to set for the girls they cannot do on own. In addition it hangs up in the DVD start-up sometimes works others not (especially if they have had the tv on for a time). Remote is not balanced and is weighted on the oposite end of normal remotes so the girls got confused on which end to point to the tv. Also the weight of it made it difficult for them to hold in small hands.Except for how cute it is I would not buy again otherwise I would have given one star instead of two! Eventhough the unit is still working we are buying a different TV combo this week!
1,"poor sound, hums",I like to listen to nature sounds while going to sleep. This product performed poorly; there was a background hum or buzz as loud as my nature music.
2,Gerber going down hill,"6 months after the buying the knife, and barely using it, it is already showing major use. Blade sticks. I have recently bought a HK automatic (American) and am much more pleased with that purchase even though it was 4x as a much. I would send it back if I could. I have sent 2 other Gerber knifes back this year as they were all of low quality. I grew up with Gerber, sad to see."
1,Crap,"I am not a knife aficionado but I wanted a multi-use pocket knife and had heard that Gerber is a reputable brand. First of all, it does not open well straight out of the package. I had a blister on my thumb after a couple of minutes of trying to push the thumb screws. Second, I've had butter knives that were sharper. This knife is worth about $3 at best. The only redeeming factor is I paid nothing but wasted my Amazon points on it. Maybe the only thing it is good for is eating Gerber Baby Food."
1,junk,"Complete and utter junk. It was so bad, I threw it away within 45 minutes of receiving it. It was impossible to open with one hand and barely opened with two. After I finally got the knife to open, the thing that is supposed to be a locking mechanism would not budge. I had to use a screwdriver to pry it to the unlocked position. The blade is the first knife I've received that wasn't sharp. I've had to make minor adjustments to new knives in the past, but any adjustment to this knife just made it worse. Totally frustrated, I threw it in the trash. This was my first Gerber knife. There won't be a second.If you want a good knife try the Kershaw Ken Onion Leek. Kershaw's version of assisted opening actually works and is as fast as any automatic."
3,"Great knife, when it works.","I really like this knife, but it has it's issues. About 2 weeks after I received it, the lock stuck and I was unable to open the knife. I fiddled with it, got it working again, and haven't had the lock act up again. The two screws holding the belt clip onto the knife come loose after just a few minutes of carrying the knife, causing it to fall off. I continue to tighten them, but have come to the conclusion I may need to use locktight.The blade is very good, holds a good edge with constant use. The handle feels good in my hand, and the knife has a natural feel when opening. If it weren't for the above listed issues, it would easily get a 5 star in my opinion, one of my favorite knives."
2,Never Again,"Never again will I buy a cheep knife. Sure for the price it was fine but, it was difficult to open and when I was cutting through a piece of cardboard the tip snapped. Well i should have thrown it out then, but I kept it. To make a long story short the handle broke, and the spring as assisted the blade right into my hand. I paid 75$ for my SOG Twitch XL, but that think cuts through cardboard like butter. Also it works great for camping which is the primary reason I have a knife in the first place. It gets 2 stars for the price, but was nowhere near worth the money for me."
3,you get what you pay for,Not an easily opened knife one handed. It opened once already in my pocket and jabbed me. The clip design is all wrong for a right handed person. But for daily use it's sufficient.
4,Perfect Fit,"I was looking for an small, easy open knife to carry with me on my morning walks with my dogs. This knife is very light and a good fit in a woman's hand, I have some difficulty with the opening of it but it is still easier to use than the heavy awkward pocket knife I used to carry around. I really felt this was a good product for my needs and the price is very reasonable!"
2,Poor,Most songs on this CD clearly shows how poorly Buddy and his group sounded. Must have been a mixing or other problemI would not recommend
5,Budy Holly Gold is Gold,"I bought this Buddy Holly CD after seeing a Buddy Holly tribute show and the music is so catchy. The CD is packed full of great songs. It's amazing how many great songs Buddy wrote in his short time here on Earth, and they're still very enjoyable. If you like Buddy Holly, buy this CD. If you don't like Buddy Holly, something is wrong with you. Buy this CD anyway, put on a pair of nerd glasses, and rock out."
4,Debut from the band that became J Church,"This is a classic. Politically charged pop-punk from the Bay area (via Hawaii). Cringer did pop-punk like no one else. Fast, catchy and full of energy. This, their debut album and a first two EPs, is not their best material (and certainly doesn't have the best recording quality) but it still shines. ""Two Friends"" is still one of the best pop songs ever written. Buy this and then find their ""Greatest Hits Vol. 1"" CD. Inspiring."
5,educationally fun,"My daughter (2) has been rather in love with Sid and all of his pals since we have started watching the show. This particular grouping of episodes is about taking care of your body. In the standard Sid the Science Kid format, these episodes are entertaining while being especially educational. This has been a good tool for helping her to remember to cover her mouth when she sneezes and why we can't only eat cake, etc. It appears these messages have been much better received from Sid than her parents."
4,Review used book,"I'm not sure If I'm supposed to review the book itself or the service of the company that sold it to me. So here is a review of both.It was a used book and it was pretty much the way they described it in the ad. I didn't remember how long they say the book would take to get to me, but I felt that it took too long. But I might be wrong on that.I think that the price was very good for the book and the delivery. I would buy from the company again if needed.I purchased the book as a gift for my daughter, so I'm not sure what it is about, except for the title.Thanks"
1,Lacks credibility,"Word of warning: this book is entirely a work of fiction, presented as factual. Kinda reminds me of the bible."
2,Not that great,"Technically, this is not a sequel to Bringing Down the House. The characters are different, and they are not card counters. Yet this story of MIT kids who used a new system to gain an advantage (and millions) playing blackjack feels very much like Bringing Down the House II. There's the genius leader, the beautiful girl, and the brilliant kid who's the main character in the story and writes the afterword. There's blackjack, Vegas, Atlantic City, and even a trip to the Caribbean gone awry.Obviously, Mezrich found a winner with his previous bestselling book and here he simply tried to duplicate his successful formula. Unfortunately, the result feels a little like painting by the numbers -- unoriginal and uninspired."
3,It was okay but bringing down the house is better..,"I bought this book cause after I read Bringing down the house by the same author, I loved it and I thought this one would be great too. The two stories looks pretty similar; MIT and Las Vegas are the main places. However I think Bringing Down the House is better than this one. I hope he write a better one next time."
3,All ready been done.,"The book is entertaining but at the same time it really seems like a copy of his earlier book Bringing Down The House. So the author is just covering the same territory. We get it a bunch of smart MIT kids took Vegas for a lot of cash had a fun time doing it, but now they don't do it anymore because everyone caught on. I think that sums it up. The sad thing is these kids are so talented and their contribution to society is taking money from casinos. How about a book about some MIT kids accomplishing something worthwhile. Mezrich seems to have created his own genre writing about rich punks who make a lot of cash."
3,Oddly Organized by Location,"I found that this book lacked organization by geographical region of Oregon. It has a good sized map of Oregon in the front with the various trips represented as a dot with a number in it. There are no city or county indications on the map. If you wanted to look for trips in Bend, you'd be guessing what trips are there. There are regional maps in the back, but I don't think there is an index into them. You just have to hunt around. I was thinking of kayaking in Bend on the stretch of the Deschutes from Wiki Up reservoir to Bend, the first easy section, which stops at the falls about 8 miles downstream. It shows the stretch on one map as easy but no mention is made of how to get there or what to expect.It has a rather large index to its credit."
2,Haggadah,"While the content was okay, the online description neglected to indicate that the pictures were all black and white which is not conducive to a beginer's book geared for children."
2,Dries too quickly,"Pros: This lube is very slippery when first applied. It is very thin and watery, and does not have much of a smell to speak of nor taste.Cons: Dried out after 5 minutes of application. Tried it several times and lubrication only lasted a few minutes each time.I do like that it is water soluble and rinses off easier than silicon based lubes, but I have tried other water soluble lubes that last far longer than this. Seemed like a good buy so I'm glad I gave it a try, but it is an inferior product as far as the duration of lubricating effects to my go-to water based lubes. For a much longer lasting lube that is still water soluble I prefer the JO H2O brand, which I also order through amazon, however I think the taste is a bit sweet. It is also highly rated, but a bit more expensive; it is worth it to me to have a lube than does dry so unreasonably quickly."
1,Loses effectiveness rather quickly,"This product starts out quite slippery when first applied, but it was more runny (thin and watery) than I liked. After a few minutes of use, the lubrication effect is gone, and you have to stop and reapply! I prefer Liquid Silk (also sold by Amazon)."
4,good book but needs a little more information.,good book with lots of information. need to know more on johnson/painter/scott types of american bulldog ...hard to find a good definitive book on these wonderful dogs.
5,"People are ""Touched"" by these cards","We've given several of these to family and friends for different reasons and on various occasions. They're great to have available for anything that might come up--whether you're visiting someone in the hospital to lift their spirits, offering encouragement or support to someone going through a tough time in their life or just using one to inspire, one of these cards is the perfect solution. Most all of the recipients have gotten back with us to comment about how much they enjoyed the card and were blessed by the CD, which includes music that was produced during the making of the TV show."
5,PLEASE RELEASE FULL SEASONS OF GUNSMOKE,"I am terminally Ill, and the only thing that makes me not think of my debilitation is watching Gunsmoke . PLEASE release the rest of the seasons in full season packs before I pass away. Gunsmoke purchasers are getting old and you will SOON not have an audience for any future releases. Come to your business sense and do the right thing and release them all in complete series.SOON PLEASE"
3,"Happy, but to long of a wait.","I order the season's of Gunsmoke for my Grandpa all the time and he loves them, but they take forever to come out. The only problem with this is that the people that most likely want Gunsmoke on DVD are an aging population and with the 20 seasons that need to come out it will take way to long if you are an older person. I also feel that the season's should just be released as a full season and not volumes because then then maybe 2 seasons could come out a year, not just one."
1,No good for me,This stuff kept rotting my roots. Had a happy garden in veg. Then death in bloom. If your plants are dying try salt fertz.
2,Bogus Condition Rating,"This book was labeled as ""Used-Very Good."" The cover is littered with stickers, dirty and bent. Pages inside are creased, marked with sticky notes and pencil markings. I hardly consider this condition to be ""Very Good,"" ""Acceptable"" maybe. Without the stickers, sticky notes, and pencil markings I would rate it as ""Good."" Beware of the seller jenson_books_inc. I am disappointed in Amazon for allowing this seller to falsify the condition of their products."
5,this is great book,"Anthony Robbins is Good. I want to visit him in his castle on some day. Cruise is good too. I loved the part about the morning, and also I thought Cruise was good in Top Gun. It's the best movie in the yorld."
4,READ THIS BOOK if you want to lose weight and keep it off!,"This book will inspire you, and teach you how to lose weight without being hungry, feeling deprived or taking up all your free time exercising. You will get step by step instruction and motivation from an author who really cares about his readers. I say this because I lost over 40 lbs over a 4 month period and have kept if off for over a year now. I was lucky enough to get a pre-release copy of this book. If you are really ready to change your life for the better and one of the areas you want to change is your eating lifestyle and become healthy do not wait any longer."
4,Great book,"I just bought my third ""8 minutes in the Morning"" book to give as a gift! I bought one some times ago and absolutely love the program.I feel more fit doing these exercises each morning than I have from working out at the gym. Crazy I know, but the truth. Of course, I walk as well so these exercises are not the only thing I do, but these work well for weight training fitness. And I always feel better when I am doing them. I highly recommend this book."
4,This is a great program!,"I am now in my 2nd week of 8MM. It is just challenging enough to keep me motivated and easy enough to keep me interested. I've lost 3 lbs just doing the exercises every morning. I feel great; I have lots of energy. I'm especially happy with the idea of not having to do endless repetitions of the same exercise - every day is different, working a different part of the body. I can see results after only one week."
4,8 minutes in the morning is working for me,"At first I thought this book was gimmicky but something about it persuaded me to make the purchase. Once you get going with it, you won't want to stop and you WILL lose weight. Most of the ideas are commonsense and have been around a while but Jorge Cruise presents them in a fun and easy to use manner, along with goal setting and plans on how to accomplish them. Most of the things I've tried before didn't last, or once I tried to return to a good, balanced regular diet the pounds would slowly creep back on. I've enjoyed this book, the diet and the exercise plan immensely. It has made a great difference for my wife and I."
4,On my way to goal weight...,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I just completed week 1 of his program and have lost 4 pounds and 4 1/2 inches. I really enjoy his program, although the flax oil doesn't taste the best, but you can always use the capsules instead of the oil. You are also supposed to have 2 servings of treats/cravings per day, which makes it easier. Being too strict will eventually backfire and you'll end up pigging out and regretting it. I don't feel deprived on this program. I have a positive outlook in that I will get to my goal weight with Jorge's program. I still have a ways to go, but I know I can do it. I highly recommend this book."
5,Best weight loss/fitness book,"I have read so many books and magazines looking for a weight loss/fitness program that works for me with my busy schedule. I found what I was looking for with this book! Jorge provides you with a food plan, a simple system for keeping track of what you've eaten, 2 daily fitness exercises for 28 days, as well as mental exercises daily that put you in the right frame of mind to conquer the weight loss. This book is meant to be written in. You'll mark off each set of the exercises you do each day in a chart he provides and there's a page devoted each day to recording your thoughts for the day. So actually, with this book you're getting a journal, a food plan, a food diary, mental and physical exercises, as well as motivation. Using the book along with his web site and e-mail is the best defence I've had against excess weight!"
4,This Plan Makes Sense,"What makes this fitness plan attractive is its grounding in sound principles of exercise and nutrition, with an added dose of motivation.The plan is an easy read, with step-by-step instructions in how to improve your health with a short investment of time each day. If you have tried every diet and exercise program under the sun, you will appreciate that 8 Minutes in the Morning does not require special food, pills, or products. For those who have been away from exercise or activity, this plan is a great way to ease back into fitness. If exercise and activity have been part of your life, this plan is a great way to take it up a notch. With working full time and being a wife and mother of 3 young children, this plan works for me; I am able to be consistent about my morning exercise and plan meals and snacks the whole family can eat. It's not complicated. I carry my book with me back and forth from home to work. Try it with a friend for a month and see what you accomplish!"
1,Totally overrated,"I bought this book because some days my schedule is so busy I can't get to the gym, and I thought it would motivate me to do a ""mini"" workout at home before work. Unfortunately, the guidance is this book is so simplistic that it's virtually worthless. One needs about four to six hours of exercise a week to get anywhere. The diet information is extremely basic. I would recommend a personal trainer for one session (at a YMCA you can get a good orientation...) and a diet book such as Eat Drink and Be Healthy. With this approach you can build muscle and burn more calories, extend your life, feel great, get stronger, and look better, but you do have to work at it."
2,"Dont buy, worked for a month than quit!","Do not buy this item! It sucks!!!! I bought this and it worked fine for about a month than quit. The timer on it doesnt work anymore and it just spins feed out all the time, every 10 seconds or so. At first I thought it was the batteries, but I replaced them 3 different times and still the same thing! So now I have to go out there everyday and spin it by hand. Def. would not buy again!!!"
2,Disappointed,"Sorry... but I was really expecting so much more from the hype. This game has really nice graphics but, it's well.. boring. Same thing over and over, and is it ever dark in these cities? I like the Thief Deadly Shadows game a lot better than this. Played it for a day then wished I'd done anything but play this game. Big hype and as usual big disappointment."
3,Excellent,"As the first game of the series it was really good, though compared to the other games the gameplay is a little repetitive but it's not too bad but the main issue a lot of people have is the story line is confusing for a while and Altair ( Main Character ) is kind of hard to relate to."
4,Assassin's Creed,"I don't own the game but I got it off A.C. Revelations. It's fun but it takes so long to get to missions and do them at the same time. Even though you would have to play this along with the others, I understand the story without playing this. I rate this game 4/5."
1,Do not buy used stuff from amazon or any other vendor,"I got it on time, in fact, before expected. I unwrapped it right away, turned on my ps3.... Surprise!!! The game doesn't work. Very dissapointed, I thought amazon quality service on used items actually worked, I realized it does not. Avoid these awful situation and buy new items only."
3,"Boring, Snore.","Ugg. this game is so boring. i was falling asleep playing it... and it's so repetitive. you do the same missions over and over again, climb a tower, save your game. boring."
3,Prince Of Persia evolution,"This is a great game, great Graphics and Soundtrack in that medival times in which Templars went to kill and exterminate the greatest empire on earth. also it has a good modern fictional story linked with this controversial religious times. BUT THE GAME IS SO repetitive, from city to city you do exactly the same things. climb a tower, pickpocket, sit on a bench, kill two 5 templars, rescue citizens,collect impossible to find flags, and kill a ""boss"". thats about all in the 4 or 5 cities. So its a good game but it has a short time until gets to be boring"
1,I would have rated it but...,"I couldn't even play it! Here I am waiting for what seems like an eternity for this game to be released, and I can't even get past the first loading screen after picking ""new game"" Ubisoft won't admit it but they rushed to release this game, not giving it enough time in QA to work out all the bugs and glitches (at least for the PS3 version) I've seen many many people complaining of the game crashing, glitching, not loading properly, and many other bugs which make the game near or totally unplayable. I would reccomend waiting to purchase this game untill they decide to work this out. Though not every copy was affected better safe then sorry. In short, could I have actually played the game, I probably would have rated it higher, but sitting on a loading screen for eternity isn't exactly my idea of fun. Thank you ubisoft, thank you for making us your personal testers."
2,Too repetitious bored after a few hours.,"After a few hours I was bored to death of doing the same thing again, and again. The graphics and sound are nice. But every location pretty much looks the same. I've put in maybe 8 or so hours, and find nothing to draw me back to the game. Perhaps more different looking locales would have helped. More varied missions, perhaps some underground ""sewer"" missions.So if you're a picky gamer, which few people are. Save your $. I've been gaming since 1977, and find most stuff very un-original, un-inspired, or just plain boring like this."
3,Advice: Rent before buying,"First off, the graphics on Assassin's Creed are absolutely stunning and arguably the best on a video game console thus far. The gameplay is top notch. And is the concept innovative? Absolutely. The problem I had with the game (and I did finish it) is that after the first four or five ""missions"", it gets mind numbingly repetitive. I found it difficult to keep playing for more than an hour at a time. The developers could have taken this game much further with a little variety. You basically perform the same tasks over and over and over and.......well you get the point. This is just one gamer's opinion and this game has won ""game of the year"" honors in several video game magazines and has received several five star reviews here. So with that said, I'd rent this game to check it out before dropping sixty bucks. I don't think this game is for everyone."
2,Everything I dislike about a video game,"Assassin's Creed has everything I dislike about a video game. In short: A lot of button-mashing, repetitive missions, poor voice acting (the guy who does Altair is awful!), an ""ending"" you see from miles away, a setup for a sequel, and virtually no replay value.It may be that it is one of the earliest versions of its type that other similar games have improved on it since then, but by Memory Block 2 (of 7) I knew exactly where it was going. Oh, the graphics are great and the free-running style is kind of fun. But after the 4th ""Save Citizen"" repeating the exact same dialogue (and the identical missions overall), it was simply not very compelling to play. I have no interest in continuing with the rest of the series."
4,Historically correct,"As far as history goes, the game developers have done their research accurately. The game is fun over all, but killing templars over and over and over gets pretty boring because you have to go to different cities, and that takes a very long time.I would recommend it for any action adventure lover. If you are into shooting games like gears of war, or uncharted, PLEASE DONT BUY THIS GAME, you will be very bored."
3,Over hyped,"This game was over hyped, but it wasn't awful. The graphics were amazing and the game play was usually fun, but sometimes frustrating. The story line was creative, but was bad. The game had plenty of flaws and could have been much better."
3,A pretty solid disappointment.,"When I first saw the commercials for this game I thought it looked like a pretty fun game. I'm a big fan of the adventure/action genre. One of my mates raved about this game and when I bought my ps triple this holiday season I decided I'd give it a shot.Although the fighting is pretty fun it is very repetitive, much like everything else in the game. Each mission consists of eavesdropping, pickpocketing, collecting flags, and assassinating targets which you do over and over again. Its fun for a while but will soon get old and you eventually just play it in order to finish it so you didn't waste your time and money. Also, the horseback riding parts are just unnecessarily long and drawn out.It isn't a terrible game but its not worth your money to buy. Rent it if you want to play it. I'd suggest spending your money on another game if you're a fan of the genre."
