5,Philosophy for the working class activist,"This book explains that empiricism arose as a habitual way of thinking--and then as a school of philosophy, with the rise of capitalism. It has become enshrined as a results-oriented, experimental philosophy. Novack points out that although the starting point may be sound, empiricism is no longer adequate to understand the world, human society, and how to join with others to change history. None of these last points are recognized as possibilities by the self-indulgent and indecisive empiricism promoted by capitalist institutions today. Dialectical materialism, on the other hand, looks at the root causes of events and takes a moral and political stand with a confidence based on scientific knowledge. Academic philosophers will not read this book and probably couldn't understand it.. It's written for you, the working class activist who wants to become more effective by understanding where you fit into the history of ideas."
4,It's a story but it's also a poem,"I enjoyed this novel tremendously. Dunmore wanders away from the story line quite often but it's never disturbing because one can simply enjoy the language. And the story itself is beautiful too, It's about love that transforms and never leaves you. It's about remembrance, longing and connection. It's also very real. I know it sometimes happens to the lucky."
1,"Strange, sick, annoying characters, jumpy story-line","I have not even finished the book yet, but I find the story line strange, the main character is annoying beyond belief. I find the subject matter rather sick in it's sexual details and quite frankly I don't know if I can finish it. How can an author think these things up! How she can think other people will enjoy reading this is beyond me!"
5,"If you have to do the LID, this is a great resource","I'm so glad that I stumbled upon this book. It's a great source of recipe ideas. With this and the low-iodine cookbook on the Thyca website, I have been eating pretty well. The noodle bake and the cabbage rolls are excellent."
5,The Low Iodine Cookbook by Norene Gilletz,"The Low Iodine Diet CookbookNoren Gilletz offers a wide variety of healthy, delicious recipe options in her book, The Low Iodine Cookbook. This is a user-friendly cookbook for everyone. However, it is especially helpful for people that have to be on a low iodine diet (LID) for health reasons such as thyroid cancer (thyca). There is also an informative Introduction, written by Kenneth Ain, M.D., in the book that will benefit thyca readers/users and their families. Norene's recipes are easy to re-create in the kitchen utilizing ""pantry/on-hand items"". She provides options for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks."
2,Too good to be true,"As a child I was always told that if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. The picture quality of this player is really good; that's all the niceness I can say about it. The recharable battery on this DVD is laughable. Charge it for 6 hours and youre lucky if you get 90-minutes of play time. The fast forward, reverse and skip buttons are on a small remote instead of built into the actual DVD player, so heaven help you if you lose the remote. The sound quality without the headphones is poor. When playing DVDs, the player involuntarily and randomly skips, pauses, and shuts off. I was really excited when I initially bought this player and got it for $99; I should have know it was too good to be true."
2,Sucky,This DVD player was fine for the first few months that I had it but then it started not recognizing disks and now it won't recognize any disks also it rattled so it is a piece of sh**.
2,"A good book back in 1980, not so much now","This book is over 30 year old. It is written on a typewriter typeface just to give you an idea of how out of date it is in regards to improvements in technology or development issues like gender.Although a bible for its time and used in many projects, it has failed to be updated to the new times and challenges. It leaves out very important matters like community participation, selection of materials, GPS, Google Earth or the use of spreadsheets or simple computer programs for that matterI was excited when the second edition was released only to discover that only minor adjustments were included."
3,Mercury Does it again....,"I think what previous reviewers are missing with Retrospective I and II (As well as Gold, just released) is that it is not Rush or their manager milking anyone... It's Mercury/Polygram. That being said, this is a very respectable collection of songs, and well worth a listen for anyone who enjoys Rush.Anything post ""A Show of Hands"" was on Atlantic records, hence owned by a different company and not included. I agree, you want to REALLY experience Rush, go buy the full albums. However, if you are just learning (or trying to collect everything, like me) then I say buy whatever albums you enjoy!"
1,Sad end for old friends,I have almost every book that Bill wrote. I got this and I read it and I just shook my head.As a man of few words I will sum it up. Jo I hate to say this.IT SUCKED!!!!They were all fighters and least they should have gone out that way. Who in gods name wrote this. It will now join the others in the collection but I will say it will never be read any more.I'm so glad the other books are fine but this is such a sad end for old friends.Dave Burgie
1,"Pitiful,just pitiful!","I understand how publishing companies need to make money,but, you would think they would use a ghost writer that had read the previous books. I started noticing bad proofreading and editing, then characters were not as intelligent, as they were in earlier books. I don't know,, I have loved every book,though some were very redundant. You could always find some kind of redemption in each.. It is with a sad heart I say goodbye to some very old friends.. I wish I knew where they ended up!"
1,"""Escape From The Ashes""","What a disapointment. Having just finished the last ""Ashes"" book and written to Mr. Johnstone about it, I have to say that if I knew it would end like this, I wouldn't have purchased it.To kill off all the characters, and not even mention others is just unforgivable.As a loyal reader since the series began, I'am really disatisfied.It would have been better to simply stop writing it altogether, and leave the characters in ""Limbo""."
3,"Mixmaster Stand Mixer, White","This is a nice basic mixer if you do not plan on tripling your recipe, etc.Amazon was wonderful when I had to replace the first one within 30 days because it burned out when I tripled by cookie recipe. So even though it was more powerful than my previous mixer, it somehow doesn't do well in thick dough. And I had not even put in the last 1/3 of the flour. So be careful what you mix. It is what you pay for."
5,Best mixer I ever used.,"I have been using this mixer for years, so when my Daughter-in-law wanted a mixer for Christmas, I knew exactly which one to get her. It lasts a long time and is hands free. I use mine several times a week because I bake cakes and make my own frosting. The one I have now I have had for about six years and that is a long time for the amount of use it gets."
5,Excellent mixer at a modest price,"I've been using my Sunbeam mixer for almost a year now. I use it at least 4 times a week, and each time I use it, I congratulate myself for the purchase. I mostly make breads and cakes. I love the fact that the bowls are glass - they are easy to clean and fit for healthy cooking. I use all the attachments and love the fact that they are sturdy and easy to clean. The motor is quiet for its 350W."
5,I love it,"I love this mixer! This is the first time in my life having one of these at 66 years old. Have always had a hand held unit. Easy to use, and love the fact that I don't have to be continually scraping the sides of the bowls because as the turn table is offset. A lot better than spending the money on a high dollar unit."
4,good service,"The product is good - however, it arrived without a owners manual and it took me quite a bit to finally get one - which makes me wonder if it really was new."
1,Save your money!!!!,"This is a terrible product. The bowl spins and the beaters do not. It broke after about 6 months of light use. The motor burned out mixing cookie dough.It was a gift so I do not have a receipt to have it replaced or fixed,"
5,Mixmaster mixer,This is a very good mixer that can handle even the toughest of tasks. It arrived very quickly at a reasonable price.
2,returned,tried to make cookie dough. when changed speeds after blending it started making noises and got hot. hope it was just a lemon. very happy with amazon returns tho.
5,MIXER,LOVE IT IT IS A NICE MIXER AND I LIKE THE 2 DIFFERENT BOWLS THAT CAME WITH IT AND I LIKE THE DIFFERENT MIXERS
1,terrible service,"This company is simply awful. I never got my order and my attempts to contact the company have gone unanswered. Do not order from them, you will never get your order and will just be left waiting forever."
4,Good but buy Rush Gold instead!,"Misterjaw: Pally, Christina Milian is good to look at but her music s*cks! Catfish: You got that right boss! Misterjaw: This Rush collection which has classics like Tom Sawyer, Limelight and others is now available on Rush Gold. Catfish: I know chief and is much cheaper to buy with Retrospective I in one 2-disc set now rather than individually! Misterjaw and Catfish says any dumbkuff who detestitates Rush will get a GOTCHA out of here!"
5,Flight in the Night,"At first it was like a Bird with its wings flopping on the grass. We discharged it all the way by holding the base and charged it up for approximately four minutes. Then we put on the flood lights. All of the children watched it go up approximatly fifty feet in the darkness, however our flood lights and children guided it up into the sky."
1,not pleased,this toy was very disapointing. although the instructions say it is difficult to learn to orperate it doesn't make up for the fact that it broke on the first day of use because it is not strong enough to handle the landing when learning to use it.
1,simply dreadful,"Wes Montgomery is one of the most important guitarists in the history of jazz - a master whose importance is rivaled only by Charlie Christian. This CD, however, is simply dreadful. I don't blame Wes for it. The string arrangements are cheesy and tasteless. The music not only fails as jazz, it fails as pop music as well. It is totally beyond my comprehension that anybody could like this music."
4,Good to hear some vintage Benson.,"Heard this around a friend's house. Thought it was a good representation of the other side of Benson. Personally I think he is a great singer and don't have a problem with the guy doing what he wants to do, but his Jazz work is sadly undersold and the big record companies and media should invest some serious money in letting the general public know more about the guy's guitar work. Tracks such as Clockwise and Good king bad while stylistically dissimilar are exceptional examples of the man's ability to tell a story and very few singers today are capable of reaching the kind of emotional depth heard on Summertime.The good thing is that George is still playing jazz regularly and another good thing is that Sony have released his first two albums for Columbia. These are both gems and a fine example of Benson's more straightahead work. Both albums are represented in the This is Jazz collection."
4,Good replacement for Canon DVDs,It works fine on my Canon camcorder. But I can feel the vibrations of the DVD while holding the camcorder.
1,Mike Bloomfield is a great guitar player but he couldn't save this mess,Mike Bloomfield is a great blues guitar player. Listen to his work with Butterfield. He plays nicely on this too. But the songs and the rest of the drips on this album make it mostly unlistenable.
4,WWE: The Great American Bash 2008 review,"The 4 way tag team bout for the Smackdown tag team titles was pretty good for a 4 way. The US title match between Matt Hardy & Shelton Benjamin was a hard-hitting,back-and-forth match. The ECW World title match between Tommy Dreamer & Mark Henry was short but sweet and the same goes for the Divas title match between Michelle McCool & Natalya. The HBK-Y2J match was a bloody,hardfought brawl. The CM Punk-Batista-World's title match was not great but pretty good. The John Cena-JBL-New York City Parking Lot Brawl was a hard-fought,hardcore and a good reminder of the 1990's ECW. The HHH-Edge-WWE title match was a hard-fought,hard-hitting,solid match. I give this event a 8 out of 10."
5,We Need More Haibun in English!,"Haibun is a Japanese form consisting of poetic prose with haiku and/or tanka interspersed or at the end of the piece. The title is an allusion to the work, ""The Narrow Path to the Interior"" by the great haiku master Basho.Ross writes a priceless introduction to haibun that serves as a course all by itself so if you know nothing at all about this wonderful form, you will come away from this book with a solid foundation."
5,"""Did you say something about scrambled eggs?""","I had been looking for this collection for my boyfriend; he was so happy on Christmas morning!The Thin Man is an amazing movie series, with the amazing Myrna Loy (Nora) and fantastic William Powell (Nick). With wit as dry as the martinis that Nick drinks, these detectve movies are wonderful and enjoyable time after time. Who knew so much class could be packed into 7 DVDs?"
4,Complete Thin Man Collection,"Myrna Loy and William Powell were superb together. They seemed to have a sixth sense for each other. Contrived by todays standards, I suppose as far as the script is concerned, but watching each as a period piece produces entertaining viewing. Astrid the dog is the ultimate scene stealer and makes up for the over use of alcohol by the two principals."
4,The complete Thin Man Collection.,Saw most of the Thin movies when growing up. Wanted to add to my movie collection.
5,Oldies are the BEST,Got hooked on this moview from Dad. watch it everytime I see it scheduled on TCM. Want the orginial black and white and find them to be the best movies to add.
5,Thinner is better,My wife and I love the Thin Man movies. I had taped them on Tivo anddecided to see if they were on DVD. Well the box set had come out just a week before and my wife said lets order it. They dont make movies like those anymore back when stars were STARS!
5,Beautiful,"If you like Nick & Nora, you've gotta have this collection. Just pop the popcorn, push play, and enjoy the beautifully mastered DVD's."
5,I think I'm in Love,"We bought this movie as a Christmas present for ourselves. We love classic movies, but had never seen any of the Thin Man movies. We decided to buy the whole set, and what a wonderful surprise. It took a lot of self control to NOT watch them all in one weekend. Like everyone else has been saying, William Powell and Myrna Loy have a great on screen chemistry. Not just the dialog, but the looks, the expressions, the exchanged glances.And yes, I think that I have fallen in love with Nora Charles."
5,Its The Thin Man!!,Its The Thin Man. It's William Powell and Myrna Loy. What else is there to say!!!
5,better than expected,"This collection is phenomenal. I recommend it for anyone ""baby boomer"" age or older. And for those young ones, it will definitely entertain!"
5,Bravo!,This set of DVD's arrived quickly and were a great price. We have enjoyed these films again and again. Thanks for making them accessible to us.
4,No other word but quiet.,This C.D. is very good but a word of warning- it is very quiet. If you want a rollicking C.D. full of Gaelic jig then you probably wont want this.
5,Top quality,"I'm a HVAC technician and this is the best tool tote I've found yet. I do a lot of service work in plants, sawmills, and other harsh environments. The LC is holding up flawlessly."
5,veto pro pac lc tool bag,"i bought this bag because i needed a tool bag to transport tools to and from work, and to the area i'm working at work. i work in a shop were we build automated machinery and i recently started doing electrical work. this bag is the nicest bag i have ever seen. when i see quality i know, and i feel better that i have bought something that is of benefit to me. first off, the bag is heavy duty. everything about it is heavy duty. the zippers, the handle, the bottom, the pockets, the material it's made out of. it has a ton of pockets, and it really is better that my tools are all standing up. really convenient. it has room for things that would not fit in the pockets. the zippers are big so you can lock it closed. the shoulder strap is nice and heavy duty. i would recommend this item to anyone looking for a nice tool bag and don' want to use a bag or box with no individual storage because it is a mess otherwise."
2,self-indulgent,"Will Self has quite a reputation. At the very least, he is a ""name"" in modern letters. I'm not sure why after reading the failed ""My Idea of Fun."" The premise of dreaming a reality isn't even that interesting and the book merely seems to be a chance for the author to print clever sentences. The chapter, ""The Land of Children's Dreams"" is the work of an author not experienced in what he is writing about and then taking the advice, ""ahh, but if the wording is clever that will more than make up for the fact I can't really communicate what I mean."" (I've been guilty of it too!) Not a pleasent introduction to a writer who is still able to display some talent in a poor book."
4,"Solid, good ideas and examples","Litfin has a winner with this book. He has excellent form/cycle anaylysis using both ""Sheets"" style figures and Beyer speed figures. He recognizes and illustrates how to spot several useful patterns and what they mean. In the second part of the book, he takes pattern recognition a step further by dealing how trainers tip their intentions with regards to having a horse ready to run his best race. Overall, there is a lot for the intermediate level handicapper to take from this work and improve his game with."
4,good compomise,"I had read that this headphone takes some breaking in time before it really starts to sound good, and I could not agree more. On first listen, there was a feeling of being underwhelmed by the sound quality. However, after a few hours of use the the highs and lows begin to sound more distinct. If you seek booming bass,then these are not the heaphones you want. I wear them working out, and they do a good job wicking away the mouisture, as opposed to my previous headphones. I am not a fan of in ear headphones or noise isolating ones. I would rather err on the side of caution rather than lose my hearing ability due to being sonically blasted out of my skull. It takes more juice to run these headphones than my previous ones, and sometimes I have to turn the volume all the way up on my player, so I would count that as the biggest negative for buyers. Worth the $50 bucks, but would not really want to pay more for them."
3,Unfortunately The Sound Does't Quite Match The Looks,"I'd love to give these a five star rating on the design alone. They bling like no other headphones, however it doesn't stop there. Like the other Ultrasone's I have they are beautifully presented, but the iCans have a wow factor of their own.The only downside is the midrange, which is recessed. The treble is very domineering, but the midrange sounds out of sync with the rest of the frequency range.Even with that said, it doesn't make me love them any less, and I'm glad I have them, but I wouldn't expect anyone else to feel the same as I do.These are only for those who really want the bling factor, or hardened Ultrasone fans. I fall into the latter."
5,I've given this book 4 times as a gift...,"Usually books that know how smart they are get on my nerves. As a reader, I'm all non-fiction and fluffy-escapist summer novels. Maybe that's why I love this book -- it's something in between, with humor, wit, and images so vivid, I read and re-read passages. It's never overdrawn, always genuine, and a glimpse into a time in the world that I'd known nothing about (having been born about a two decades too late to enjoy it) from other than an intellectual perspective. But Patrick's novel makes me wish I were there..."
3,Good Expantion Pack For An Alright Game,"First off, I will say that RCT3 is a much better game than some of the other tycoon-like games I've had, primarily Thrillville: Off the Rails and Zoo Emipre. Anyways, if you have bought this expantion pack, you prabably already bought the SOAKED! expantion pack. If not, then buy it too! This pack is pretty good because it allows you to add animal exhibits to your park, but what it lacks in is the amount of animals it presents you with. I can't quite name all the available animals, it's been a awhile since I last got on the this game, but believe me, you don't get as much as you'd think you'd get. Overall, it makes the game a bit more interesting, if not slightly more difficult. The only other thing is that some the extras are the exact same extras you get in the SOAKED! pack, such as tunnels and waterfalls. But so what? Big deal! So if you like your orignal RCT3, buy this expantion pack and the other one while your'e at it."
4,A good expansion,This is a great expansion for RCT 3. You get to add animals and animal shelters for your guests to look at. They are very easy to set up and understand how to use.I only give it 4 stars because you don't get much. You get animal stuff and some rides. At least it's only $20.Definitely buy it if you have RCT 3.
5,What About . . . . . . . . . . . .,"I played it at my friends house and Im thinking about getting it but...Does it erase all your previous games that you saved??? Help ME!!!!!! ,UNDECITED"
2,Not even for the price,"If you want to turn your kids off of science at a young age this is perfect for you. Focusing actually moves the entire unit and it is frustrating trying to get any semblance of focus. When you do get it focused, you can only ask yourself ""Is this it?"". It's like looking through several layers of saran wrap at something even when focused. I had no luck using the projector to see if it improved any. The whole product just feels cheap and flimsy, even for the price."
1,Poor Craftsmanship,"This microscope is poorly constructed. I purchased it for my daughter to use for a school project. Each of the lens were of poor quality, making it almost impossible to focus. The biggest problem was the microscope came without instructions of any kind, not even a note informing the consumer that there is a hidden compartment underneath the base for a battery. I would not recommend this product not even for a elementary school project."
2,very powerful toy,"I purchased this for the magnification power alone. no other set for less than a hundred dollars will get close to 1200x mag. all the gripes about it are true, it is cheap, and it does move around as you try and focus, but you can focus it, and the instructions were hidden in the bottom of the box. I almost missed them too.the accessories are a joke, the light is very orange, the projector hood is useless, but it has the power we were looking for, so overall, I got exactly what I excpected. if you want ""perfect"" look somewhere else, If you want affordable power, you might consider this one."
3,its just Okay,"I wasn't holding much hope when I purchased this because of all of the other reviews I had read about childrens Microscopes and this one is no different! It works very very well on low magnification and we could look at a lot of things (including the brine shrimp we hatched that came with the kit), but at the 1200x power you can not see anything!! On the bright side, this one does seem more durable than others that I considered purchasing and it does have a case to store it in. However, if I had to do it over, I think I would have purchased either the EyeClops remote magnifier or one that was capable of viewing 3D objects."
1,too liberal,"I am a die-hard Conservative Republican.Sean Hannity acts just like a liberal! In fact, he resorts to liberal tactics like ""fight for liberty"". We all know this is a liberal game! I wish he's stick to the main points he outlines in the first chapter, instead of rambling about ""attacks"" on our country by liberals. Let's stop accusing fellow Americans and focus on the real enemy: Al Quaeda!!!! Dems are with us; they overwhelmingly supported our good ""president"". So, as a fellow-Republican I urge you to NOT read this book."
1,Pitiful polemic,"Mr. Hannity is an intellectual pygmy who has never expressed on original idea. He is a poor debater and an embarrassment to many thinking Republicans. How could someone of ilk get so far? Only in America, regrettably."
1,Hannity goes to find scapegoat.,"Just a poorly written partisan book. There is no objective analysis on any political or social issue. Wherever is there, all distortion and manipulative. This books is just another example where conclusion comes before analysis. He picks up data or facts whatever fits his conclusion. There is no totality. He is unhappy about America and instead of constructive analysis, he goes out to find scapegoats - the liberals. Does that make him (or other scapegoat finders) happy? Does that make America better? I doubt. That's why he becomes more and more angry everyday.There is nothing new in this book. He writes the same thing normally he repeats loudly again and again in his show.Anything wrong in America - blame it to Clinton and other liberals.Right wing idea - always good and cannot be wrong (just blind).Rich people pay more tax (he forgets mention that he is not taking about proportion)."
1,Awful,What a waste of money. Most upsetting is that this man claims to be a Christian. Horrible hate monger.
1,page 158 says it all about this douche bag,"Mr. Hannity seems to have an obsession with the light in the loafers lifestyle since he devotes most of his bile infected rant to it. So obsessed in fact that the reader is left with the question, ""what's really going on?"" It is obvious that his hate is an external manifestation of his inner hate toward himself. Maybe he can't be the person he truly wants to be so he has to attack the object of his inner desires. Moreover, he seemed to know an awful lot about ""fisting""(158) - a little too much if you know what I mean. Maybe it is time he comes out of the dark cave he has been living all his life and accept who he really is."
1,Down With Conservatism!!!,"I truly feel sorry for Sean and all the rest of America's embarrasment who buy this book. They are all people who are desperately trying to hang on to a mindset that by all rights should be dead. Hannity and his idiotic party are nothing anymore but a bunch of lies, distortions, and factual errors that make me ashamed to call myself an American. If someone like him is going to put this much energy into a political work, it should at least be for a good purpose. And what really pisses me off is that, while he is a little Rush Limbaugh clone himself, he is going to influence a whole other generation of ignorant right-wingers to screw everything up even more. Yeah, I could go on for days......peace, love, and understandingalways"
4,Conservatism 101,"It's not meant to deal with every liberal icon, argument, cause, or concern. It's meant as an engaging introduction to conservative thought. I think it does a fine job. It's not meant to end discussion, but to start it. If that's what you want, this will do just fine."
3,Conservative reader,"While I watch Hannity and Colmes almost every evening, this book was a disappointment. Sean has a tendency of over-simplifying every problem: We are good guys, liberals are wrong, arms race is good, abortion is bad, we, Americans won the WWII, missile defense program is a savior, and as soon as we have school vouchers, they will solve all problems of inner city youth. While the book ""Slander"" by Ann Coultier is very well researched, and has tons of references, this book is mostly declaration of Sean's views. Actually, Sean is unfortunate to publish his book right after Slander, it looses in comparison. And finally, the style is not something I would expect from such good TV and radio host - Sean uses clichés like ""man and women in uniform"" so often that it is surprising. Want to read a good book - buy Slander or ""Bias"" by Bernard Goldberg."
2,Could have been better...,"Although I feel Hannity is on the right side of most arguements (no pun intended) I felt the book came off as being somewhat light-weight. It brings up a lot of great points, but others have written better books about them."
1,Repeat the lie often enough and the masses will believe it,"Sean Hannity, the fascistic voice of the rich and powerful, presents his arguments as a defender of liberty (wotta joke!). In Sean's mind liberty means one party (Republicans) ruling with an iron fist. If a majority of us keep on listening to clowns like this then I'm afraid for the nation's future. We are headed for a country with a few powerful elite and a whole lotta poor and not much in between."
1,Substance-free,"Nothing new, nothing substantial. Same old hand-wringing by knee-jerk conservatives who can't understand why they're always proved wrong in the long run."
1,The Title Says It All,"The flawed logic of Sean Hannity--another member of the Fox Channel's stable of demented commentators whose unspoken credo is ""Why can't everyone be as good as me?""--appears in the very title of this anti-intellectual disgrace to publishing. ""Freedom"" means ""Liberty,"" which is what liberals fight for. Conservatism, on the other hand, fights for the restriction of liberty. No doubt we'll see more hate literature from this sorry fellow, along with fellow haters like O'Reilly and Coulter. How sad. By the way, the number of used copies for sale should be a dead qiveaway of just how many copies of this book are purchased simply to artificially create the illusion that this un-book was a best seller. The alert reader will notice that books by Coulter, O'Reilly, et. al., use the same tactic."
5,Sean Hannity for President,"This book is fact based and well sourced. Reviews to the contrary are disingenuous at best--and the reference to Moore's book? Puh-lease. That book has been de-bunked by just about everyone as riddled with factual errors and mis-statements.Sean has the issues right. He's a modern day Ronald Reagan and I predict right here, right now; he will be President someday!Run, Sean Run!!!"
2,Nervous Twitch,This Book becomes a broken record. Hannity blames Clinton for everything from A to Z. And Im a republican!
4,Makes you think,Like other books I've read this book opens your eyes and ears to the ways of the Liberals. The result is you become more aware of how they act and ways to counter their ideas. I think the most interesting thing about Liberals is how they don't like the label but yet they endorse the ideas.
1,"Hannity, America's closed-minded superstar","Bought it, read it...This book is for old ladies who need to reaffirm that their racist, homophobic, closed-minded ways are still the way to think and live. Sean Hannity is a showman, and a good one, but as a political pundit his comments (and notice I don't use the word ""facts,"" since very few are in this drivel) are as lightweight as, oh, any of the other talking heads that are cluttering up the airwaves these days. Hannity, Limbaugh, Coulter, O'Reilly, Colmes, etc. etc.........they're all closing the door on THOUGHTFUL political discourse and a variety of views. They are not what America is about. Everything is wrong to Hannity except living in a house with the picket fence and your 2.5 kids and not stirring the pot...except to take on any new ideas, that is.Take a bow, Sean Hannity. You're a national joke, and you're so blinded by your own ego to even notice."
2,FEAR IS NOT DIPLOMACY,"If you actually read this review, which threw the masses of simmilar reviews I don't believe anyone will, I must first admit that I only read 1 chapter, which was posted on however I fell that he uses the tactic of fear to push a conservative policy of war, I believe as I am a liberal, not that evil doesn't exist, but that it is senceless to revolve our lives around. I believe that fear causes more violence than it solves FEAR IS NOT DIPLOMACY!."
1,"Hannity, and the GOP for Dummies (...in 3 easy steps)","1. It's absolutely essential that... on Nov. 2, we make the right choice, because if we make the wrong choice then the danger is that we'll get hit again and we'll be hit in a way that will be devastating from the standpoint of the United States.- Dick Cheney2 Evil exists. It's real and it means to harm us- Sean Hannity from Deliver Us from Evil3. THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF- Franklin D Roosevelt"
1,Not nearly as good as Rush,"First, for full disclosure, I like Rush. I like the way he stays on message and doesn't give an inch. I like the way he remains focused and precise. Even if you don't agree with Rush, you have to admit that he is a laugh riot.The same can not be said of Mister Hannity. His arguments are very muddleheaded. Even for someone who is pulling for him to make his points, you come out feeling somewhat sleezy and sorry for the guy at the same time. You get the feeling he isn't too bright and got where he is by blow drying his hair rather than studying the issues. A talented writer he is not.Avoid this one and wait for Rush's new book. The original is still the best."
1,It's Sean's World. We just live here,"We should be united after September 11, but Hannity likes to divide Americans into ""us and them"" categories.""Us"" is those who agree with Hannity. The ultra right wing, pious Christian who doesn't question anything our commander in chief wants to do, no matter how morally warped that might be.""Them"" is anybody who has a slightly different opinion. Or, anybody who dares to question the administration. This is especially telling since the Clinton years saw Hannity, et al launch into anti-Clinton diatribes that make Michael Moore's comments on Dubya seem like a love letter by comparison.So, let freedom ring? Ring for who? Only those who Sean thinks it should ring for? Hannity usually comes dangerously close to telling those who disagree with him to go back to Iraq. So much for believing in the First Amendment.If Lincoln knew what Hannity, Coulter, Limbaugh, Shrub, etc has done to the Republican party and conservative politics, he'd roll over in his grave."
1,No clear thinking,"Mr Hanritty is so wrapped up in the sound of his own drum beating in his head that he fails to make any logical argument. His diatribes against the Left lack consistency and evidence. I was looking for cogent dialogue, but found none here."
3,So-So,An mediocre book. I agree with his thoughts but Sean comes across as hateful towards the people he writes about. I was expecting a little more intellectual thought than the usaual left bashing I normally here
5,Right or wrong??? Hannity is 99% right!,"Finally, it is nice to read a book that is about LIBERTY, FREEDOM, and CHOICES. Sean Hannity may say he is a conservative, but deep down he is showing you the difference between right and wrong. Throughout his book, he points out what is right and what is wrong, and explains it. He is for the people and it clearly shows throughout the book. He explains that liberty should be protected, not attacked. He explains how liberals attack liberty, because they attack choices that every American makes. Restricting choices is restricitng freedom. Hannity shows how Republicans are pro-choice. We are a free nation, because we have the ability to choose. Let's not lose from freedom today, so I, along with Sean Hannity, ask everyone to protect our freedoms today."
3,Sean Hannity overview,This is appropriate for Libs..Think about it...When you start reading the book..you're on the left side.When you finish reading the book...you're on the right side..Coincidence????
1,Load of manure,"what drek. I'm not bothering to offer insightful comments b/c this book---like pretty much all conservative demagoguery in print---fails to offer any insightful comments.if you're a knee-jerk reactionary who loves to be pandered to and told your narrow-mindedness is patriotic, then this tripe is definitely for you.if, on the other hand, you have the ability to rub 2 brain cells together, you can either avoid this overpriced paperweight or use it for the toilet paper that it is."
1,Like communists? You will love this book.....,"A rant by a right wing neo-con that hops into bed with views of ""the more freedom taken from you the more freedom you will have."" or ""love your party, not your country!"" He is a true believer in rewriting our Bill of Rights."
2,"I like Sean, hated the book!","I read the first 100 pages and the last ten. If this book can be number one on a book list, I am encouraged to write a book, myself. Read the Amazon[.com] excerpt's and save your money, or, just turn on the radio to Hannity's show and you'll get the book. As a fellow New Yorker, I had to give an extra ""star."""
4,an okay book,"Starbright and the Dream Eater has an intresting plot, but the way the story went wasn't really good. Finding about her real mother had nothing to do with the story."
4,Solid stuff,"First... take a close look at the cover. This is volume 2 of the series. I didn't notice and was a bit miffed when I opened my box. Still, it stands alone just fine (though I still wonder what I'm missing). It is not quite as advanced as I was hoping for, but is good for the beginner or intermediate studio operator. The sound samples of different effects and settings are really quite helpful -- but listen on good headphones or monitors for the best benefit."
4,BRIGADOON,THIS IS JUST AS GREAT AS IT WAS ALL THOSE YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST SAW IT IN A THEATRE. GREAT TO HAVE IN MY LIBRARY NOW
5,Fun Fifties' Musical!,"I enjoyed this musical more than I ever imagined. The backdrop is obviously painted, but after a few minutes one doesn't even notice it anymore. The songs are charming and the dancing is lovely. Especially the ballet with the two leads. There are a lot of traditional Scottish elements in the story. With the main theme of the story being a love story. Overall it is delightful and one finishes the movie feeling like singing and dancing away!"
3,On the Highlands.....with Gene,"A charming lyrical film adaptation staring the celebrated dance chorographer, Gene Kelly, collaborating again with distinguished Hollywood musical director Vincente Minnelli .Another vibrant and melodious world. After loosing their way, two American visitors (Kelly and Johnson) eventually find themselves at a secluded Scottish village which holds a mysterious enchantment, where shortly (Kelly) is soon captivated by a young lass(Charisse).The film has a pleasant simplicity with duration of 108 minutes. Unusual for Minnelli, whose silver screen cosmos is like been on a continuous razzle dazzle merry go round. Kelly's energetic on-screen presence never fails to display magic and bliss and by the end of the film, you don't have a worry in the world. Sadly at the time when the film was made, it had received some poor reviews and received little recognition at its release. For any Gene Kelly fan, there is nothing stopping you to view this great film.Enjoy!"
3,Brigadoon - the movie,"Not one of the better made movies. Dated. Gene Kelley was even disappointed that he couldn't film on location. The story and plot are a bit dated, but the music is beautiful."
2,Weak musical film,"Lerner and Lowe, Gene Kelly, Cyd Charisse, Vincent Minelli. Sounds like a formula for a masterpiece, right? Think again. The Lerner and Lowe score has only two memorable songs - ""Heather on the hill"" and the misplaced ""Almost like being in love"" (misplaced because it seems to have been shoved into this film and doesn't fit the rest of the score either musically or thematically). Gene Kelly's choreography is uninspired here. Some of his dance routines in this film are stolen - move for move - from previous films. Worse, they aren't very good. Cyd Charisse has little to do here except look pretty. Vincent Minelli directs poorly. The film looks stagy. Moving track shots are badly done. We can actually see the film shudder a bit before the camera begins to move. The big crowd dance scenes are awful. This is a third rate MGM musical."
1,buy something else.,These bits do not hold up for multiple uses. The 10mm bit was toast after tightening the bolts on a VW halfshaft to 57 ft-lb.Used the 8mm bit to readjust the door. it is also showing wear after loosening and tightening 2 bolts.buy something that is hardened.
4,4.5 stars: Reminds me of George Winston at times,"This was a happy accident. I was completely unaware of a new Craig Armstrong release until I stumbled upon this album yesterday. I had loved both, ""Space Between Us"" and ""As If to Nothing"", so I bought it without a doubt. This is an album where Armstrong, one of today's best scorers (and certainly Scotland's finest), provides us with a feast of his piano works, some of which you've heard in a more elaborate way before in one of his other albums. Other tracks he put together for the purposes of this recording.Overall, the album hits a few classical-like notes, and it has a bit of George Winston-ish flavor at some points. There's the Armstrong ambient accent here and there, but this is no ""As If to Nothing"", which is why I give it 4.5 and not 5 stars. Most certainly it goes best played while driving, writing or chatting over wine in a rainy night. Sorry if the reference sounds cheesy, but it's true."
3,Maybe I'm looking for a studio recording,"It sounds like it was recorded in a stadium. Bass and treble aren't well balanced. But maybe that's what was intended, or all that could be done. I suppose the cd was made for persons with a sentimental preference for live recordings of marching band music. This recording is a matter of historical interest, I think. It sounds as though the crowd had a grand time that afternoon."
2,"There's almost no there, there.","I bought this book because I am about to migrate functionality from a Win32 application to the wince platform (aptly named?). I was expecting a wealth of information and examples on the peculiarities of the CE platform so that I wouldn't have to learn things the hard way. While the book does provide a little bit of the CE material I was looking for, most of what it provides is basic pre-MFC (stone age) windows programming which is virtually useless to an experienced windows programmer. If the reader is a complete neophyte to windows programming, the book might be helpful, if the poor soul was constrained to platforms which are too impotent to support MFC programs.While the book is not a total loss, for me was mostly a waste of money. Try ""The Windows CE Technology Tutorial"" by Muench instead."
1,Doesn't fit Pre-98 Bladerunner Blades,This product does not fit Bladerunner Blades pre 1998 and is actually labeled ROLLERBLADE...NOT Bladerunner. Especially if you use BladeRunner Discovery Skates this will not fit. You need one with the hole on the side of the brake and not the top.
1,The Music Video was better....,McEntire should have left well enough alone because the music video to this song was perfect. Her acting in the movie is an embarrassment...maybe she had bad direction or something. Who knows?
2,Great Family Movie,This is a good movie that parents can watch with their children and know they are being taught the values good parents teach their children. Reba McIntire can act as well as sing!
1,IS THERE A GOOD ACTRESS OUT THERE????,An intelligent script is done in by the overdone histrionics of Miss McEntire who it seems cannot act her way out of a paper bag. Her performance is laughable. It ruins a good story.
3,Disappointment but still pretty good,"I loved the Refreshments in college, my room mate and I listened to Fizzy Fuzzy Big and Buzzy all the time. It was like he found buried treasure in the used CD store when we located it.With that said, Bottle and Fresh Horses is not nearly as awesome as FFBB. I don't know about their more recent CD's but this album has I would say 2 great songs and 3 other pretty good songs. That's comparing the songs to the ones to the ""every song is awesome"" first album. The songs have the same...feel, if you will, but what I love about the first album is singing along and the great rythms, and this CD just doesn't have it to the extent of the 1st.Which...5 songs you actually enjoy on the same album, that is pretty good compared to many other artists!"
1,Music Security Sucks,"Bought the CD after discovering them. RIPing it to my PC results in no music. As I have never been able to listen to it, I don't recommend buying it."
3,Good Movie,Well made family crime drama. Nothing new but has its heart in the right place. Excellent performances and stylish direction and cinematography. Don't expect a great deal of action in the literal sense. This is a movie more about people and a family surviving in crime.
3,The Yards,"A couple of good performances and some mediocre ones. That is why this is not a stand out movie. It is certainly worth seeing this movie about the train yards of New York, but it doesn't quite reach that point of excelling. The story is not fast paced and you must be patient with the movie along the way. In the end though I think you will say not bad, just not great. Wahlberg turns in a decent performance as does Phoenix, Theron, and Caan, but none of them made me feel I cared what happened to them. This shows the underbelly of the corruption in some companies trying to win contracts and political influence as well. A good drama when you don't mind a slower pace. Good quality DVD with some replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""The Departed"" and ""Brooklyn Rules"".CA Luster"
4,A sober look at corruption and consequences of choices,"The movie almost seemed like a docudrama. I've been wondering whether or not the film is based on actual events. It's definitely a character piece even though the characters are very stereotypical. That being said however, it is extremely well acted and honest. Plus the fact that the direction is very low key only added to the genuiness of the film.And like other viewers had commented, I also thought that the plot development was pretty predictable (except for the ending which took a couple of surprising turns) but who cares. It was engaging to see the drama play out.Not a puchase or a divine creation but definitely intelligent and dramatic."
4,Wonderful stroller,I bought this stroller for my 15 month old daughter. She LOVES it!! VERY VERY easy to put together. She has bumped into a million things with it & you would never know. The little carrying basket is wonderful for them as well.
3,You get what you pay for!!!,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves to use her doll stoller, but the seat fabric is constantly slipping off, which makes her extremely frustrated. Also, the plastic piece that holds the canopy is place snapped off on both sides, rendering it useless. I called the company to try and get a replacement, but they said they cannot offer one, nor can they replace the canopy part. I wish I had paid an additional $15 for the next model up!! Overall, I'm very dissatisfied with this product."
4,:),It covers there best songs..just like it says :). There's a few that you will probably want to skip but overall a good album.
3,"Warrant, simply the best.","This album is all of Warrant's very best tracks. Jani Lane and the boys are simply fantastic. The songs on this album bring you back to the 80s, to when music was good and the videos were great. Heaven is and always will be the best Warrant song and how can you forget Jani's flirty eyes on the video??!! And Cherry Pie, with the unmistakable guitar screechin of CC Deville, as he guested on that track..The only way to discribe this album is, in the words of Jani himself, ""heaven isn't too far away"".Only thing I would love to see, would be for Warrant to release their video hits, wow, it will be worth waiting for."
2,So So 80's Pop Metal,"As a child of the 80's I loved the singles ""Heaven"", ""Cherry Pie"", & ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" but the rest is flotsam. It is still a part of my collection however."
3,"Warrant's best, yes, but also their worst","This album features some of the hair-band classics such as ""Heaven"", ""Down Boys"", etc, but also includes songs from the nightmare of an album, ""Dog Eat Dog"". ""Machine Gun"" and ""Hole in My Wall"" have absolutely no business being on this disc and for Warrant to call them hits is nothing short of a travesty. Other than that little mishap, this represents the Best of Warrant from the hair-band era but doesn't include the REAL songs offered on the ""Ultraphobic"" and ""Belly to Belly"" discs."
2,Not like the rest,"I'm really surprised to see how many positive reviews this book has gathered. Due to this I ordered my own copy as well as Bead on A Wire by Sharilyn Miller. The two can't even begin to be compared but I'll try. All Wired Up just lacks in good photos to show techniques, the drawings are small. There are only about 5 glossy pictures at the end of the book for inspiration pieces but none for projects. I'm very disappointed in this book. However Bead on A Wire is an exceptional teaching and inspiring book, with enlarged, color photos of every aspect of learning to work with wire. The projects are just beautiful and doable. I'm a beginner but sure Sharilyn Miller's book can accomodate all levels. So glad I purchased this and will return All Wired Up."
5,The things you need to know,"I don't usually take the time to write reviews, but this book really impressed me that much. It is one of the only books with pictures and explanations that I could understand. What Lareau teaches you how to make in this book are basics that everyone needs to know - how to make a strong hook and eye clasp, how to make your own ear wires, and how to wrap cabochons for pendants. So many of the books I have seen guide you through gaudy, crafty-looking projects that I would never actually wear. This book is short and sweet, starting with how to create the perfect loop. Excellent graphics."
4,Wakeman was right!!,"Mr Wakeman said it from the start: Make a CD with the Live parts of the Keys and another one with the studio parts and give that album a different name. After 5 years they have made the studio album with the name Keystudio. Okay, you can't have it all, Rick. Although I feel a little bit cheated here, because I'm a great Yesfan and have to buy something that I already have. Therefore 4 stars instead of 5. Nevertheless it's a album I wouldn't want to miss in my collection. Nothing new here, only 56 seconds extra in the beginning of Children of the Light from Mr Wakeman. But to have this 7 beautiful songs on one album makes my day. In my opinion, for instance That, that is and Mind Drive are beautiful Yessongs, evolved from their early Yes musical roots, but in a modern jacket. Okay you can make this album yourself by burning it on your PC in any sequence you want, but I always liked original packages. Glad I bought it!"
5,READ ON,"Ok...here it is..in a nutshell...If you have every YES cd on the market...to date (as I do)....and that includes ""Keys to Ascension 1 and 2""...then to purchase this CD would be a waste of time and money...you already have the studio recordings that comprise this collection....they were added to the ""Keys"" albums....For those of you who didn't care to purchase the ""Keys"" albums....then this is a fantastic opportunity for you to complete all the lost studio tracks you need to complete this era of YES...I wouldn't mind having the booklet.....but spending the money for something I already have is wasteful and overkill....sorry.I will agree with the others who reviewed this selection...YES has grown stronger in their years.....they were always an excellent studio/live band....but they haven't lost the edge they always had....if anything....they're far more polished than they were 30 years ago.Anybody who would refer to these guys as a dinosaur band....hasn't given them a fair listen..."
1,Horrible Sound Quality,"This recording is very poor done. Basically, its a beach recording of wind and waves. However, I doubt a wind screen was used (or the record levels were way too high) because strong wind and wave crashing consistantly and frequently, cause saturation and distortion. Very annoying. More like a Zen Supprise, not a Zen Sunrise. This was my second and last Serenity Series purchase."
5,MP3,Just bought my first digital files from Amazon. I like the MP3 format and I think I just found my new home to buy digital media!
4,Better than I remembered,"As a college freshman in 1982, I was thoroughly immersed in the music of the 80s. While Men At Work were never one of my very favorite bands -- I always thought their BUSINESS AS USUAL album was overrated and a bit languid -- they unquestionably were a radio staple during the first half of the decade. This greatest hits collection brings together the band's strongest tracks, and the material stands up remarkably well some 20 years later. The disc thankfully includes ""Overkill,"" which to my mind is Men At Work's finest moment. If you are an 80s music fan, this CD is a must-have."
4,Rocky Avenue Of Love,"Vanessa Williams has remained as one of the most distinctive women in R&B; music. Each song that she has made still continues to tell a sonnet of love to any audience, at any time.Her 1997 album, Next, reflects upon the rocky roads of love and marriage. That album remained true to Vanessa at the time, when she and her first husband, Ramon Harvey divorced. The songs still are as tough and as strong as they were released at the time. Songs like Happiness, Lost Without You and Oh How The Years Go By, range from Hip-Hop to comtemporary, and heavy to hard listening very smoothly.Although many people still think of her as a one hit wonder with Save The Best For Last, the songs on Next still prove that Vanessa Williams still has some staying power in the wings. All the way to the next level."
1,This album made me want to stick a pen in my ear,"This album was certainly not a disappointment. Vanessa Williams is a terrible artist, and this is quite possibly the worst album ever released in the fine nation of the United States of America. My mother has this CD, and I was forced to listen to it in the car. I was ready to jump out of a moving vehicle when the first track, ""Who Were You Thinkin' About"", came on. But as the album progressed, notably during ""The First Thing on Your Mind"", I had the urge to strangle myself with my safety belt. Overall, this album is a disgrace to mankind. Because of music like this, I sometimes wish that music had never been invented. However, the saddest part about this is that Vanessa Williams actually got paid for creating this ""music""."
3,ok,"Wasn't what I expected. Don't have the Wii for fit board. Didn't say I needed it, that is why I chose this game."
1,My fitness coach 2 :(,"Overall I don't think this is a good use of your money. I found the workouts to lack everything, honestly. They weren't very hard, i don't even break a sweat unless I do one of the challenges. So if you just want to do challenges, then pick this game but there are a lot better wii exercise games out there than this one."
3,It is boring!,"I was so excited about this new game coming out (I love Fitness coach), so I was wishing it for my birthday. Unfortunately when I was playing it a couple of times it was nothing like the old one. There is no continous workout. One exercise is at the most 2 minutes and then you stop and go to the next exercise. The whole workout is at the most 10 minutes. It is very similar to Wii Fit but with the added feature of recipes. I hope they come out with a real Fitness coach 2 or plus."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought the second version of My Fitness Coach because I enjoyed the first one so much. It was a total disappointment. There is no place to add what equipment I own, no place to control the duration of the workouts or how challenging they are. The workouts are too short. I like the fact that I can use the Wii board and monitor the weight; however, I don't like the new set up with the instructors and I don't use the nutrition part. Total waste of my money!"
2,disappointed,I purchased this because I loved MFC and was hoping that MFC2 was just an improved version. I was way wrong. There is no real workout. You do exercises with lots of lag between. The only time I can see using this game is when I only have 10-15 minutes to exercise.
4,no third term,"an amazing collection of photos and a few pages of text compose this independent production. probably 1000 items comprising banners,posters,pennants,ribbons,coins,handbills,metal pins,novelty items,celluloid buttons,joe louis and anti-FDR stuff are included. some notes on availability and a price guide(circa 1972) complete the 83 pages."
1,"Bad reference book, bad teaching book...","What can I use this book for? It doesn't even cover essential windows structures or the registry. In fact, it covers barely anything in depth, and I am left wondering how they could fit so much of nothing in a book this big.I know some people swear by this book, but I don't see how, and I basically LIVE programming."
1,Warning about this CD,"I purchased this CD based on the sample I heard on this web site. The sample was really beautiful so I ordered the CD. Once I recieved the CD I sat down to meditate, really looking forward to hearing the whole CD. I WAS HORRIFIED, not more than a minute or so into the absolutely beautiful music and chanting there came animal sounds. This of itself isn't necessarily bad unless the sounds are of farm animals. I kid you not, suddenly you hear a rooster, a cow, a goat etc... It was as if I went from a tibetan buddhist monastery to Old McDonald's Farm. The sounds DO NOT FIT with the music and are discordant, jarring, annoying and out of place. I will never listen to this CD again and recommend you never purchase it either. The music and chanting are great, maybe the best of its genre, but it is destroyed by the poor judgement of the creators of the CD who didn't realize that farm animal sounds are not exactly conducive to meditation."
1,tedious,"This is without a doubt one of the dullest books I have ever read. I'm sure it's very worthy and all that, but there was nothing in this book to draw you in, to enthrall you, to make you want to keep reading. It's just a list of words.It was a massive effort to finish this book. Other people obviously enjoyed it, but it's delights escaped me completely."
2,"SHINIA, GIVE US WHAT MADE YOU A STAR","there is no doubt that shinia is one beautiful woman, even as messy and poorly dressed as she is. us music lovers made her a sucess with the woman in me album. why, she gave us what we want and on that album she did just that, her reward is the only woman to sell over 12 million albums. her latest album is the pits, the songs so far are lousy. she has fallen into the same trap that other female artists have, we don't want their life history songs. we want any man of mine, you win my love, and other pop tunes like the other songs on that album. now if she was as smart as she is gorgeous, she would have picked up on this and her latest album could have exceeded the woman in me album. AND, DOES ANYONE REALIZE THE UNKNOWN POTENTIAL SHE COULD PRODUCE IN A MINI SKIRT AND HIGH HEELS. MEN AND WOMEN ALIKE WOULD SIMPLY GO CRAZY. SHE WOULD OUT SELL EVERY ARTIST IN THE BUSINESS. DOYLE CONNOR"
1,That Don't Impress Me Much,"I beg you, if you are a country fan do not buy this album. It is pure blasphemy to the entire history of country music. And if you are a pop fan who's looking for the songs you heard on the radio, you won't find them here. Everything Shania puts out to pop radio has been remixed and altered endlessly. Her desperate attempts for crossover appeal are humiliating and pathetic."
5,Shania IS THE BEST! STOP BASHING HER MUSIC!,"Wow, I can't believe how much crud people can make up about Shania! Stop bashing her! Shania is a sweet, caring, wonderful person (and yes I do know this by personal interaction). Her fans are forever and her music is amazing! It inspires us and makes us better people. For people checking out Shania's album for the first time (where have you been! j/k) don't listen to all the bad reviews because I personally feel that these people are JEALOUS! This CD is awesome and you will never get tired of it! I listen to it everyday and I never get tired of it. I have encouraged many people to buy this CD and they all love it! Country or Pop, it doesn't matter! Its awesome! Check out Shania tomorrow night on CBS...she's gonna rock this country!"
1,All appearance; no substance,"It is so sad that with so many truly talented country female performers, Twain receives so much publicity and airtime for her mindless lyrics and mediocre singing ability. In addition, the overwhelming similarities in her music to Mutt Lange's work with Def Leppard is ridiculous. ""Honey, I'm Home"" could at times almost pass for ""Pour Some Sugar on Me."" It really is a comment on looks and flash prevailing over true talent. True talents: Martina McBride, Trisha Yearwood, the Dixie Chicks."
5,Fast fun interlaced with a few heart-melting ballads,"On first hearing ""Come On Over"", you are impressed by the number and consistency of the tunes. Shania has truly tapped into the fun of being a woman in the 90's! Her songs make me think of everything from the excitement of a ""girls' night out"" with her heart pumping rythms on ""Man, I feel like a woman"", to the wonder of the male-female electric energy. I can't help but get all mushy when I listen to her ballads, and the way she gets just enough twang in there to spice things up. She does a good job of getting you to think about what really matters in life, but makes it fun! Black Eyes, Blue Tears sums it up for me: "" I'd rather die standing than live on my knees, beggin' please...."" I've never been a country music fan, but if Shania Twain is country, then so am I!"
2,WHAT A DISAPOINTMENT!,"I thought Shania Twain was great after hearing ''That Don't Impress Me Much"" and ""From this Moment."" My friend let me borrow her C.D. and I was unimpressed! Alot of her songs are cheezy & meaningless! I could write some of them in my sleep. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!"
2,"Overall ""Come On Over"" is uninspired & bland: not her best.","I thought the songs were not up to Shania's usual standards. I enjoy good country music and this wasn't it. Most of them put me to sleep. There was not enough variety and Shania seemed to be going through the motions. I would not recommend this CD to anyone. Actually, I would like my money back."
1,Country gone bad.,"Come On Over by Shania Twain sold millions and millions of albums but I despise this cd with a passion. Shania is one of the worst singer-songwriters I have ever heard, especially in the genre of country/pop. Her voice is completely unoriginal, there's no fire, range, or accessiblility. I can't believe how truly awful her songwriting is! Terrible cliches, junior high filled lyrics and child-like melodies. Songs like That Don't Impress Me Much, Man I Feel Like a Woman!, Don't Be Stupid, and You're Still the One just gives me the willies. The only two tracks that have any emotion in them are From This Moment On and You've Got a Way. Come on Over is a horrible and silliest record of the '90s. Stay clear from this over-rated mess!"
2,Shania goes for the overkill!,"So the Shania juggernaut continues with the release of the international version of `Come On Over'. I would recommend that if you want this CD buy the other so called `country' version, at least the songs on it in their original versions are better, than the remixed disco and pop versions. It is a sad indictment on the music industry that this CD has 9 radio hits on country radio in the U.S.A. when much better singers like Suzy Bogguss, Lorrie Morgan and David Ball etc. are ignored. Not too long ago it was a mega hit album that produced 4 hit songs, but I guess Twain's record company is going for overkill...and lastly at least the Dixie Chicks have not sold out their country sound so they can become `pop music divas'. When will artists like Twain, Martina McBride and Reba McEntire give up the pop cross-over ditties and sing music that suits their style of singing better. Enough is enough!"
5,This Is A Good CD,"The Lovelyness Of ""You're Still The One"" And ""From This Moment On"" To The Silliness Of ""That Don't Impress Me Much"" And To The Song ""If You Wanna Touch Her, Ask!"" This Whole CD Is Just A Good CD But I Don't Like Every Song On It Like Deana Carters ""Did I Shave My Legs For This"" But All-In-All I Like This CD"
2,"What happen to being ""COUNTRY""?","When I heard (and bought) Shania's CD ""The Women in Me"", I though she was the next country deva. But after hearing her new one ""That don't impress me much"", she left me wondering, what happen to being a country singer? Not to mention the song itself makes her sound like she has an IQ of zero, no......I don't think I'll be buying anymore of her CD's. Like the song say's ""that don't impress me much!"". Thank you very much Ms. Twain and have a nice day!"
1,a total waste,"please, this is an example of what country music has become. give me trisha yearwood or faith hill instead of the schlock presented here. this is nothing but fluffly, middle of the road pop and should not be taken seriously."
1,Pure Garbage,"This album is simply crap. I liked her previous effort, ""The Woman In Me"" and I picked this one up when it came out. I've regreted it ever since. This album is one of the reasons I no longer listen to country music. Don't buy it!"
1,Shania is NOT country music!,"OK....let's face it. Shania is not a country music singer and the fact that she tries to pawn herself off as one makes me want to vomit. Listen to the songs on this CD.....they all have the same, manufactured pop beat that you'll hear over on the top 40 station. So they throw a little fiddle in there and call it country...what a crock. The vast majority of songs on the record have the depth and intelligence of a rain puddle in the middle of the desert. Some of them may be catchy, but after you've heard them once or twice, they are just plain annoying. Shania doesn't have a very good voice and she can't write her own music. About the only thing she CAN do is look good, but now she's turned into some sort of two-bit whore wearing a leopard print bikini. Shania Twain is one of the worst things to happen to country music since LeAnn Rhimes showed up to become the country music version of Michael Bolton."
5,This is a MUST buy for every Shania Twain fan!!!!,"I own this CD, this is a well written, beautifully, sung CD. Is is a well put together CD with a great mix of uptempo songs and ballads. The uptempo songs have a ""Kick you in the pants attitude"" that is FUN !!. The ballads are sung so beautifully from the heart, that you wish you were getting married now just so you could have them played at your wedding!!!. This is a MUST buy, not just for EVERY Shania fan but for ANY fan of FUN, HAPPY, ENERGETIC, SWEET, and ROMANTIC music. My suggestion would be to buy 2, because sooner or later one of your friends will want it too!!!!!"
4,US Version is Better,"In Hong Kong I bought International Version for a long while ago, the first thing I feel is, is that call country? If u just listen this CD, I belive u have the same feeling. But just bought the US Version, the arrangment are total different, country is back. I love USA Version more than this one. One more thing I can say is : It proove Shania is both a good country and pop singler, should we still disscue on this point? Music is enjoy, no matter how it is, good music is good music. I'm a host is radiorepublic, I boardcasting Shania Twain's song also, just due to it's a good music. I give this CD 4 stars beacuse of it should be name under International Pop Version."
3,It Does the Job and Nothing More.,"If you're looking for a crowd-pleaser of an album that won't challenge the ears, Shania's gazillion-seller ""Come On Over"" will suit you well. It's a collection of crafted pop tunes with a slight country twang courtesy of producer/husband ""Mutt"" Lange (AC/DC, Def Leppard). ""You're Still the One,"" ""From This Moment On,"" and the catchy ""That Don't Impress Me Much"" are all agreeable ditties that have found a welcome home on radio. There are better pop records than this, but there are also twice as many that are worse. ""Come On Over"" does the job as a record that aims to please and nothing more."
3,Nothing to write home about...,I've heard/liked some of her songs & heard this was a winner. Didn't do anything for me though. JcW
1,"Very dissapointed, Shania has no talent at all.","This album is not worth anything. All her songs sound the same, and it's sad. Her voice isn't even sweet enough to sing slow songs. Who said she was country? I say she should be trown into pop music, and stay there. To be a country singer, you need to be able to sing, and have talent. TRASH ALBUM!"
5,This album is great!,"Shania Twain is better than any other country singer! Mostly because she's also pop. Shania Twain's ""Woman In Me"" album is good, but ""Come On Over"" is better! It contains great songs like the romantic French track ""I Won't Leave You Lonely"" and fun songs like ""I'm Holding Onto Love"", ""You've Got A Way"", ""Man! I Feel Like A Woman!"" ""Rock This Country!"", ""You're Still The One"", ""From This Moment On"" with Brian White, ""Black Eyes, Blue Tears"", and ""Honey, I'm Home!"" A great album for parties or if you're just in an eregetic mood. But not too energetic like Tina Turner."
2,Come on.....,"I bought this because I admire her catchy singles on radio -- particularly ""Don't Be Stupid."" But, when you hear her own the radio, you only hear one song at a time. Back-to-back-to-back, the thinness of this material becomes painfully obvious. The songs all sound alike -- just take a look at how many of the titles contain exclamation points! And the over-the-top arrangements that mirror Shania's thin voice quickly wear thin. No doubt, she's gorgeous to look at....but, this CD seems to prove Shania Twain is someone who should be seen and not heard....."
2,I'm caught in the middle..........,"I enjoyed her ""The Woman in Me"" much more than this one. The songs that are on here are ones that get me going when I am doing chores around the house. With this album, there just isn't the depth that there was with ""The Woman in Me."" And what is it with her clothes in her videos??? As her career gets bigger, she wears less and less clothes. What message is she trying to get across?"
3,"good hook, limited vocal range","her songs are written to fit her very narrow vocal range.. tho they all have great hooks.. her inflections irk me at times but then I see her videos and all i can think is "" I want this woman"""
2,Copy Cat,"Her husband Mutt Lange produced this album and it shows. He also produced Def Leppard albums. The similarities between her songs and various Def Leppard songs is ridiculous. They can mostly be heard on her song ""Honey, I'm home"". This song is a reproduction of Def Leppard's ""Let's Get Rocked"" Shania Twain has her looks going for her, but not her music."
4,"What ever happened to ""Dance with the one that brought you""?","Shania has always been a terrific singer, with an amazing voice, who is obviously very easy on the eyes. Unfortunately though she is moving further away from country. I still feel her best song is ""Dance with the one that brought you"" from her first album since it has the old style country sound. This is a terrific album, especially the song ""From this moment."" - one of the best love songs ever written. One question though, what happened to Bryan White in the video? He just disappeared and it became an all female version. All in all, Shania is terrific, but she should not be classified country."
5,Tips that Improve the Sound of Your Exhaust,"Three and a half inch diameter and twenty two inches long. The tips are made of heavy stainless, perfectly formed and finished. The sound improvement is surprising. The larger diameter,length and shape make a deeper,louder and better sound. I did not weld mine on. I cut four slots about an inch and a quarter long in the tip. Used a torco ss clamp on each tip. Torco ss clamps can be tightened super tight and hold great!"
4,Sirius Stiletto SL10,"Radio works great. Had a little bit of trouble getting signal initiated, but after that I use it every day."
1,Terrible reception,"I live in a relatively flat rural area of Pennsylvania and purchased theSIRIUS Stiletto SL100 Portable Satellite Radio Receiveralmost two years ago to use when working outside. It has been a major disappointment primarily because of the poor reception. The headphone antenna is mandatory to obtain any signal, but even with the headset I am only able to get intermitent reception. It is lost as soon as you walk under a tree, behind a telephone pole or God forbid a butterfly flys overhead. It is primarily designed for the creative listener that likes to hear every 10th measure of a song or intermitent pieces of a game and mentally fill in the rest. It doesn't sound like the new Stiletto 2 is much better."
5,EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS!,"I have searched and unfortunately purchased many products looking for a quality one -- THIS IS IT! Worth every penney! If you do a lot of dust-mopping or wet-mopping, this will pay for itself after one use -- you won't be disappointed! Thanks Amazon for making it available to the consumer. I was not able to find it anywhere except on your site and a commercial cleaning supply site (where I would have to buy in bulk -- I only needed 1). Well-made product .. and I love the fact that it can extend from 48 - 72 inches! Highly recommend!"
3,Deer Leap,This author names most of her books after pubs in England. She has wonderful characters that are familiar in this series. Inspector Jury always solves the murders and in this case the murders of animals as well as people. This is a quick read and delightful.Audrey Barth
3,"Trio, Da Da Da Da Da",Bought this on the strength of the title track but found some great tracks on this album.
5,Great Live Album!,This is one of the best all-time live albums in rock history and it depicts Lynyrd Skynyrd at their peak. These songs never get old and are just as great if you are at a party or listening alone!
5,My favorite MHC book,"I have read the majority of her books and this one is my FAVORITE! Every chapter, I would think I had it figured out until I would read the next chapter and then I would change my mind. She keeps you in suspense until the very end."
2,Not Up To His Usual,"Having just finished Over The Edge, I can't believe the same author wrote The Web. This book lacks the intensity and drive I've come to expect from Kellerman. I could not get into it and on page 40 or so still nothing of interest had happened. I kept skipping pages, hoping I would get to the ""real"" story soon, but I didn't. If you are a diehard Kellerman fan, by all means read this book, but don't expect to find the interesting relationship between Milo and Alex or any of the usual psychological intrigue because it's just not there."
1,Stink!,This book was absurd. There was no '0' or that's what I would have given it! A silly premise and an equally silly ending - totally low-rent and beneath the author. Blech and double blech. I can't say blech enough!
2,Not his best Alex Delaware book but good. Plenty of twists!,"Most recent in the Alex Delaware series. Alex and his significant other find themselves on a remote tropicalisland with little or no outside communications. Problem is (big suprise) people are dying under mysterious circumstances and, much as they would like to leave, they can't. That is until just after they solve the mystery. Nothing original but good steady plot. Moves quickly with lot's of colorful characters and spirited dialogue."
3,THIS ONE DID'NT WORK FOR ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I loved all the other books by Jonathan Kellerman, but this onewas a little to slow. And a little to unbelievable."
3,Quick Review,"An offer to good to pass up. Three months, all expenses paid, on an island in Micronesia. Dr. Bill Moreland has invited psyhcologist Dr. Alex Delaware to his tropical estate to assist Dr. Moreland with organizing his papers for publication. Arriving with his girlfriend, Robin Castagna, Dr. Delaware soon realizes that all is not as heavenly as expected on the small island of Aruk. Lack of tourism and industry, a military base that has sealed itself off from the rest of the island, and a growing frustration between the haves (Dr. Moreland) and the have-nots (practically everyone else) are all coming to a head. To further complicate things for Alex is the seemingly odd and questionable behavior of the good Dr. Moreland himself.A very good mystery, which left me guessing as to what exactly is going on here. Left me satisfied when all the pieces finally fell into place."
2,A Departure,"This is a departure from Kellerman's usual mystery focus. And for those Kellerman fans who love Milo, be prepared for disappointment since Milo doesn't appear. I love Kellerman, but the story here was ridiculous. The ending was so far fetched that it made me yank off my iPod (I listened to the audio version). Character development was poor, but that could be because there were too many characters. Only Elizabeth George can get away with that. The book did not keep my interest and this is unusual for a Kellerman book. It was entertaining in parts, but overall a poor effort. I finished the book only because I'm a devoted Kellerman fan. If your goal is to read all the Alex Delaware books, then by all means read it. Otherwise, tick it off your list and move on."
2,Not so good,"I was looking forward to reading this book. I should not have wasted my time. It was very unlike most Alex Delaware books, no real sleuthing, no realistic dilemma, ridiculous premise, and no real conclusion. Silly waste of time."
1,Stay away from this one,"If you're the type of person who likes to test out the source code examples in books, you're in for a real challenge with this one. There are no compiled versions of the source code, no make files -- you even have to create your own manifest files. I can forgive all this. What I feel cheated about is the bugs in the examples and all the time I had to spend to modify the source code so that it would compile. (I finally gave up.) I have contacted O'REILLY about this and they appear to have acknowledged the problem. I'm hoping the author will produce an updated version of the source code at a later point. I suggest downloading the examples from their web site and seeing if they compile and work properly before buying this book."
1,NOISY,"I thought the price was too good to be true!!!! The sheet set looked good in the package, the pockets are extra deep HOWEVER they are incredibly loud! Every turn we make sounds crunchy. They are very durable but not soft at all. Very disappointed!!"
4,A real artist,"The album Maladjusted yes is not a complete album with all his best work, but the songs i believe touch on all his different types of music. The song ""Trouble loves me"" has to be one of Morrissey's best songs. It takes a little while to get in to it but once you get it you are hooked. The words scream to you and the chorus really gets you going. I think the other people who wrote these reviews need to go home and listen to the album again because they are trying to hold on to the Smiths and taking it out on Morrissey."
5,A remarkable collection!,"This music is remarkable! It is memorable, well arranged, and some of the most moving music I've heard in years. I used some of it for my wedding ceremony, and there wasn't a dry eye in the house! My favorite song is Greenwaves. Give it a try and you will see what I mean. This is music that goes right down to your soul, hangs on and won't let go!"
4,Good mix,"This is my first experience of Secret Garden, and though I think the name a bit prosaic, I must admit that these two are very talented. The songs on ONE IN A RED MOON are varied in style and rhythm, from the gospel-like ""You raise me up"" to the (non-religious but) almost worshipful ""Gates of Dawn"" to the stately ""Elegie."" They're all lovely pieces, and quite worth a listen."
5,Major improvement on a great product,"I had used N-Large2 and N-Large before. I was a little irritated that the Subscribe & Save program successively was suspended on each of them, requiring me to twice create a new order. The improvement with N-Large3 more than compensates though. While I saw a little difference between N-Large and N-Large2, the difference in N-Large3 is dramatic.1. The taste has noticeably improved. It was good before, but was rather too sweet.2. It is much more soluble. Despite using a shaker with a ball, I would always end up with clumps. No longer a problem.3. The texture has improved. It had before seemed just a little on the sludgy side, but no more."
4,Great replacement service,Very nice ; met my expectations and what a great priceAdded the aesthetic value needed for my study room.
3,Works as advertised,"The Sportsuit Relay Case works as advertised. The case easily straps to your wrist, making it easy to view the iPod Nano during your run. I have small/thin wrists, those with thicker wrists may find it more difficult to strap to your wrist. There is an expansion strap for strapping the case to your arm. I have not tried the expansion strap yet. For the price, the item is as expected."
2,Okay but flimsy,"This product served me about a year before it started ripping at the seams. I wore it on my bicep, and I wish I could say my muscles caused the seams to rip, but it is the quality of the product that is in question because I didn't overly strain it.Do not recommend."
4,Great case,"I trained for and ran a marathon with this case. Great stuff.I have two caveats - if you have large arms the band isn't wide enough. Also, although the outside of the case is waterproof, the part that touches you is not - it's neoprene, so if you sweat a lot the inside of the case gets foggy. That never messed up the Nano, but you couldnt see the display."
3,"Looks cool, but it's just okay.","I bought this case for my girlfriend for her birthday and she has had a couple of problems with it. First, the click wheel doesn't work very well through the clear cover. She always has problems making selections on the nano. Second, the armband doesn't have enough adjustability and the case is always falling down her arm by the end of the run.The case does look cool and the design is nice, but it doesn't work as well as the $10 armband and case I use with my nano."
2,"Great voice, bland arrangements","Kim Criswell is a spectacular singer, but the arrangements here don't do anything for her. She soars, but they just kind of lie there in a very pedestrian way. I love Kim's voice and was so excited when I discovered this disc existed, so it's a bit frustrating. I still think Kim's a genius, she just needs to work with the right people. Better luck next time, Kim! And keep on singing!!!"
1,A definite lack of inspiration,"A very disappointing effort from a talented singer. The choice of songs lacks inspiration, and Kim Criswell seems to lack an emotional connection to the material. This is a disc in which nothing seems to come together. The orchestrations lack imagination, Criswell isn't at the top of her game and the choice of songs could definitely use some wok. I hope her next album, if there is one, is better."
1,Let's try to figure this one out....,"Sometimes there are albums that just don't work, and it's hard to understand why. On BACK TO BEFORE, I think I can figure out why certain things don't work. Some of the difficulties are due to the orchestrations, which are deflating and lifeless. Some of the problems may be with the singer, who is piercing and shrill at certain moments; melodramatic and arch at others. The least of all the difficulties is the material, which is where I differ with other Amazon.com reviewers. This is a classic group of songs presented here. They are just not presented very well, unfortunately. So any plusses are for the smart choice of material."
1,"Garbage, disintigrated upon use.","Garbage, disintigrated upon use. Literally fell apart as the dremel started to spin, before ever even touching the surface. little fabric strands everywhere."
3,"Work the exercises in this book , and read elsewhere","I found the exercises quite challenging and some, once you've solved for the solution, were very intuitive. Some were difficult (I spent 2-3 days to think about each of them), some were quite straightforward (less than 1 hour for each). If you want to learn stuff from this book, you got to solve the problems! Mind you, I believe if you want to learn mathematics, you need to solve problems.Besides the exercises, I don't think this book can live up for the cost. This book was used in a course I took. I thought about buying it for a week, but I finally didn't. Instead, I went to the library and solved the exercises. There are better references out there at this level (Hoel&Port&Stone, Feller, for instance), with same or less price."
2,The topics are interesting.,"However, this book is not appropriate as a text book.Usually, textbooks help to illustrate and develop the concepts you overview in class.This book, however, is just the opposite. It is a book that will take considerable time for a graduate student to read on her own.However, if you are taking a class, you will most likely find it useful if you can ask questions to your professor, which will make it possible to read it in a reasonable time.Some classmates and I agreed this book seems to have been written in a too concise style with the purpose that the avid to learn student has to buy ""Introduction to Probability Models"" by Ross as well."
3,Nice vocals....,"Carnie and Wendy can really sing, but maybe they should have had some outside input on the songs. Not that the songs aren't good, they are just all ... well I'll be blunt, boring. So you end up with a lot of great harmonies on some truly mundane tracks. If you really love Wilson Phillips give it a listen. If you love the Wilson Phillips hits, then wait for the new LP and hope it's more commercial than this."
2,"Good voice,bad song","I heard Christina Milian wrote the song ""Play"" by J.Lo and couldn't wait to hear her sing.Well about a month or so ago I heard them anounce the song and the singer on the radio and was excited about finally hearing this girls voice.Well her voice is amazing,but the song is,ummmmm not that great.The song sounds an awful lot like Mya's hit song,""Free"".The lyrics are very much similar to other songs that are about having fun and dancing.I hope to hear some songs that are different from this song."
4,let me rate movies on the product page w/o writing a review!,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
2,Naive Professor ignores Facts,"Skolnick sits in her high chair in Berkeley surrounded by her statistic reports and modern scholarship. She makes bold statements that kids from divorced homes don't end up so bad . . . no harm no foul. Of course many parents feel the same way. Let's get divorced. The kids will recover. As a school teacher, I have lost count of the numbers of tears I've dried from students who are going through and have gone through divorce. Sorry Doc, these kids bare scars for life! And what is this about promoting gay and lesbian marriages as acceptable? Arlene, have you ever watched a friend die of Aids? Have you ever heard their last words of regret for the ""lifestyle"" they chose? Sorry, but come out of your university and see the real world."
1,THESE GUYS [STINK]!,"when i heard the song samples i was very disapointed. i readsomewhere that these guys, and i quote ""kick the [stuff] out of all the boy bands"" and ""we're hardcore"". both these statements are ridiculously false. this is slow [stuff]. if you read the other guys' review he said ""your girlfriend will love it!"".yeah, your same girlfriend who loves n'sync, christina aguilara, britney spears, and those [people] who sing ""who let the dogs out""."
3,Full of information and errors,"This is a book with a lot of information. Each chapter can be used as a starting point for a specific six sigma technique. However, this is the worst edited book I have ever read. You can hardly find one page without errors/typos."
2,You will be MORE confused after reading this!,"Stallcup's Electrical Design Book makes a good attempt to navigate learners through the complex web of the National Electrical Code (NEC), but ends up confusing things even more. The book is filled with inconsistencies and errors. It also does a horrible job of explaining the key points of electrical design. The book mostly copies sections of the NEC word for word without offering any explanations. The examples are difficult to follow and littered with errors.I come from an Electrical Engineering background and am not alone in these opinions. Many of my peers also find the book to be extremely confusing. It is hard for me to understand how Stallcup books have become the standard for electrical design. Maybe no one else wants to tackle the NEC."
3,"Overview of colour therapy, not complete.","A good overview of colour therapy, but not complete. I do not suggest this for anyone serious about learning technique."
4,Scarface' solo debut is a great one,"This is the album that helped him become the King of the South, a title the man still easily has. Short as with all his albums, 43 minutes and 12 songs: 1 is a classic, 1 I skip, and 1 is ok, the other 9 are good or great songs. Production is great for a 1991 release. Guests are on no songs so it's all Face! Lyrics are great as usual. He has some gangsta tales, some about the cocaine, and some of the deeper lyrics you'll hear from a rapper. A must have album.#1 - 10 (upbeat CLASSIC)#2 - 6 (dirty slower song)#3 - 8.5#4 - 8.5#5 - 8.5#6 - 9#7 - 9 (good beat)#8 - 7#9 - 9#10 - 9 (about gettin' taken off for some cocaine -- hence his name)#11 - 9#12 - 9 (very deep and good lyrics on this one)Brad Jordan --- b. 11/9/70 -- b. San Antonio. TX moved to Houston, TXcheck all my reviews"
5,Excellent Service,The CD I ordered was mailed out right away and my son received it before we expected him to receive it. I would definitely do business with this merchant again.
2,yuck,"The first album (Vegas) was much better. This crosses over too much into rap and other MTV .... Too bad, I thought these guys really had it; it seems like I was wrong..."
2,Nowhere near the quality of Vegas,"I wanted this CD to be Vegas II, but it isn't. Every group wants to grow and they did. Just more towards techno and less towards what made them great. So they'll just blend into mediocrity. Check out Vegas and More. Amazing how good they were when they were poor."
3,Tweekend seems to be a little over-tweeked,"While Tweekend does break new ground for the Crystal Method, the explosive energy that made Vegas so amazing is gone. These new songs don't build up into monumental orgasmic grooves like their earlier songs. Instead, they move along with a steady groove that never really goes anywhere. This became even more apparent when recently seeing their live show. I've seen TCM 5 times over the past 4 years and their previous shows (like their music) was mind blowing. Unfortunately now, Scott and Ken seem a little bored, and like them, I also find myself incredibly bored when listening to Tweekend."
1,What a waste..,"Am I the only one who didn't like this album? Compared to the first this one sounds uninspired and unoriginal. I can't tell one track from the next, they mainly consist of repeating synth/drum tracks and a few scattered, mostly unintelligable lyrics. Don't get me wrong, I loved Vegas, one of the best CD's I have. But Tweekend came up far short in my expectations. Save yourself some cash, listen to a friend's copy or just pass on this one. I sure hope their next release will be better."
1,This is a rock album,"I loved Vegas. With this album they abandon techno and try some leaden rock beats. I guess they want to be The Chemical Brothers.Listen to ""Name of the Game"" before you think about buying it.Even the cover is ugly. It looks like a Supertramp album (Crisis, What Crisis?)"
3,not what I had hoped for,"OK. let me first say that this is not really my music scene, so take this review or leave it. i heard Vegas for the first time about two years ago and was REALLY impressed with the intensity of CM. I'm not at all into the electronica scene, and have very few albums by any of these guys, barring the odd chemical brothers or sasha/digweed ""thing"" but I had BIG hopes for this CD.....and feel a little let down. beginning of track one definitely got me excited, but that was about where it ended. just not the same ""feel"" as keep hope alive or vegas. now....if this is where they are in their creative metamorphosis, then more power to them, but I think they're going to leave some people out in the cold by not staying true to that same thumping, intense je ne s'qua (spelling??). whatever. you want mine and you can have it cheap - drop me a line....i won't miss it."
3,Song 5,I liked song 5 big time. It took me a long time to figure out what it it reminded me- the rapping of eric b and rakim.
3,Pales in comparison to first cd,"Read a few of the reviews on here, decided to give it a shot. It's an OK disc, but compared to Vegas it doesn't come close to the intensity. Much more laid back, sounds similar to say Fatboy's You've Come A Long Way Baby. Worth having in the collection, but probably won't get nearly the playtime of Vegas."
2,More like a prequel than sequel....,"This ain't no Vegas beater! Just take the Real samples above into Protools, loop them and there you have it - the whole damn album! Primative, monotonous, repetitive....lacks creativity....Now I must admit, Vegas is my all time favorite electronica album, but what on earth were they thinking. Just do a little less touring and get into the studio with some original ideas. The Chemical Bothers new ""Come with Us"" album puts this to shame. What a shame...."
4,commercial yet very enjoyable,"At first listen there were probably only two tracks which i really liked. However, i really came to enjoy this album after listening to the whole album all the way thru a few times. Yes, it is a little commercial sounding, but the beats and production are too good to be passed off as another big beat album for the masses. I particularly like the first three tracks, the laid back/sensual track ""over the line"" and the hardhitting track ""tough guy."" Overall this album is well worth it."
5,Sidestar-Something More,"I just saw them perform in Boise and they were INCREDIBLE! (Note that I am 39, not 19!). The 4 gave me their CD autographed and then visited with me extensively. They were very sociable and polite. Their music has no foul language in it. A very talented group of young men. Keep up the good work!"
2,check it out at the library but don't buy it,"I believe the author was told exactly was PHP and Matsushita Electric wanted him to know, and really, how would he even know since he doesn't even speak Japanese?"
2,Very Disappointing,This book was written in an annoyingly cliched manner that greatly detracts from the subject.
3,Somewhat of a redemption,"After the horrible ""Strip"", this was somewhat of a return for Adam.Lots of energy and big pop sound was back that was completely missing from ""Strip"". Alas, this would be the last we would hear from him for quite awhile and in hindsight, this is a good c.d. to have to complete your Adam Ant/Adam & The Ants collection."
3,lots of filler,"im only a moderate r&b; fan, but i was impressed by the title track with its strong rythms and slightly funky wah-wah guitar. but unfortunatley theres way too many sound alike ballads stuck in the middle that make them sound like filler. surprisingly ""you should be mine"" wich featurs a rap by mase and production by puffy is a great song( maybe the cd could use more of this?)one of the best songs on here the last song ""when the chariot comes"" wich details the loss and grief he must have felt when losing a friend that must have been very close to him, its almost atypical of the rest of the cd with soft chants and supple strings its a shame that it was demoted to the end of the cd when it could have broken up the monotony in the middle"
1,Rival deep fryer,"We purchased this deep fryer two and half weeks ago. Without warning it stopped working! Piece of caca this is. I would avoid it. There are better deep fryers out there. Because I can't just leave the stars out of this, I'm giving it one star, although I would prefer to give it less than ZERO."
1,WANNA WASTE $$ GO FOR IT,"Purchased this product 3 months ago, looks great and easy to clean.I tought I would be statisfied ...big mistake .I have used around 3 to 5 times only ...now thermostat seems to not respond anymore ...it does not heat at all, because thermostat shows that oil is at right temp. all the time ...I am really annoyed about this situation ...this is a brand New Item ..electric part is totally defective.Beware"
2,Not compatible with Windows 7 computers,It's designed to be able to hook up to your computer but check with the autoxray before you buy since in only works with computers running on 32bit operating systems
1,Don't waste your money!,"I was disappointed with the unit when I purchased it 4 years ago. It's just a code reader. I recently tried to update the progam to the current version using the ""free download"". Now the unit will not turn on. I sent it in for an estimate. The repair center said they have no means to repair or reprogram the ez scan 6000. They did offer a replacement for $417.61! If I wanted the broken one back it would cost $50. I told them to keep it and I that I would never buy from Autoxray or SPX again. There are cheaper and better scanners out there."
1,Autoexray will not repair after you buy,"I baught My Autoxray EZ-Scan 6000 about 3 to 4 years ago. I've tested about 3 automobiles for personal use.The Scanner Quit Working , so i called the help Number. They said that they did no repair on them.and tried to sell me a new one.They still tell you where to buy them at thier web sight.I lost several hundred Dollers.!!!!!!!!!Do not buy Autoxray code scanners unless you want grief!!!!!"
5,great book,I met the captain on a charter cruise in Baltimore Harbor. A delightful man who loves to share is experience and knowledge.
2,Would make a cute cheap gift,"This book is more for a gift as it's one of those ""1 page/ 1 Line"" books. I knew that from the other review. However, most of the ""fun ideas"" we already know! I love ideas, but if you're going to write a book, you should have some creative ideas the rest of us don't already know about."
4,Still Scorps,"Yes this is a mellower version of the Scorpions, but true fans will still get into this album. I started listening to the band when I was 15, I am 35 now, as we have all changed so has this band. A look at the front cover should tell you that this is no longer a young man's band. I like the German cut Du Bist So Schmutzig (You are so dirty) and the song Eye To Eye dedicated to the dead fathers of Klaus and Rudolph is touching. There is enough rocking on the album to keep me intrested (Prisilla and Aleyah) but this album is not like Blackout or even Crazy World, it's a more reflective version. It is good makeout music, my wife grew up like me on a steady diet of Scorps and she appreciates some mellow tunes at last. Good album."
1,EYE II EYE should be CD II TOILET,"This one's definitely a floater. I can't believe what I'm hearing on this album. I feel so ashamed that I was sucked into buying this disc after hearing ""Mysterious"" (the only half-way decent song on this pathetic attempt). I nearly lost my lunch listening to the synthesized beats in ""To Be No. 1"" and prayed the rest of the songs wouldn't follow in the same direction. No luck there. Want some advice: STAY AWAY FROM THIS ALBUM. I can only say I'm suprised there was no accompaning smell with this cd."
4,EYE TO EYE,"SCORPIONS ARE COOL!THIS WILL BE THE NEXT CD I BUY.IONLY WISH YOU WOULD LET PEOPLE HERE THE ENTIRE SONGS AT LEAST ONCE.IHAVE ALL THE OTHER SCORPIONS ALBUMS.THIS ONE WILL BE ADDED TO MY COLLECTION.OF THE TINY SAMPLE THAT YOU LET ME HEAR ,IWOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT I LIKED OBSESSION THE BEST.IT SOUNDS LIKE A CLASSICAL SCORPS BALLAD WITHLOTS OF ENERGETIC GUITAR.I WOULD GIVE ANY SCORPS CD A FOUR RIGHT OFF THE BAT.IF YOU WOULD HAVE LET ME HEAR MORE, I MOST LIKELY WOULD HAVE GAVE IT A FIVE.AFTER ALL IT IS THE SCORPS."
5,Very good job,I see a lot of different opinions about this album. I like it very much someone hates it. Funny!!! It's definitely worth to check it out.
1,A real let down...,"This is by far their worst release to date. With the recent resurgence of several 80's rockers, you would have expected more from the Scorps. Oh well... maybe next time."
2,Why?,"What where they thinking?? One of the hardest, most rockin groups of all time lays a great big egg with this sorry album.No heart, no passion, and no memorable songs.Sad."
4,"Doctor, the experiment was a success...","If you have thrown up your hands at Joe Satriani's 'new sound' and have thrown your copy of Motley's Generation Swine onto the freeway, you're not alone. I'm very picky about changes because they are painful and quite honestly they RARELY work. Ahhh... but this Scorpion CD, Eye To Eye is the exception. If you've grown tired of 'riffs' and are wanting good songs look no further. I'll admit the single (To Be No. One) is a bit kooky but it really is a good song. To be honest the last Scorpion CD I thought that had any merit was Savage Amusement, everything since then has had some good songs but they were not great cd's. Though this cd does have a clunker or 2 (Priscilla?), the songs that are good are absolutely GREAT. If you've grown up and are expecting more from a group, give this a try, if you are still waiting for Blackout 2, stay in your room and let the world pass you by."
5,Nice book.,"The product came promptly and was in good condition. Bess Streeter Aldrich is one of our fine Nebraska authors, relying heavily on character development to propel the story."
1,Taichi Meditation,"I was very disappointed with this recording. It consists of solely forest sounds and a very short melody, which is repeated ad nauseum during the whole track. It seems designed to put you into a trance, not because it facilitates meditation, but out of pure boredom. I fail to see why it is called ""Taichi."" I bought it because of the title and see absolutely no relationship to taichi, except perhaps the Nature sounds (which are too loud). I feel I have been mislead by the title."
5,An Inexpensive Yet Valuable Add-On to Your Track,"The GeoTrax Rail n Road System is a super toy for toddlers age 2 1/2 and up. The toys are durably-constructed and they develop physical coordination and design creativity each time your child rearranges the tracks.That said, both the Tracktown Railway and Working Town starter sets eventually show their limitations because there's only so much you can do with the track pieces provided. That's when add-ons like this one become so valuable.The real treat of this set is the additional pair of switches. Used in conjuction with any of the GeoTrax train sets, your child will be able to dream up many more layouts with these two vital pieces. Two additional curves and straight bridges are also included. The remaining pieces are scene decorations - trees and signs - that kids will love to place throughout their new world.This affordable add-on will open up lots of new possibilities for any existing GeoTrax setup."
2,Pedestrian and a bore,"If I did not have a policy of finishing what I start I would not have finished this book--and thus would not review it, since I do not think one should write a review unless on reads the book. There is nothing compelling about this book and it is hard to see why anyone would say that it is worth reading. The review by S. Berner is exactly right, and I am disappointed that I did not read that review before I read the book. If I had, I hope I would have sense enough to not read the book. With all the great books there are to read, why waste one's time on a book such as this?"
2,Misleading title and description of item,"This item is titled 10"" Marble Chess set. It should be accurately titled as faux or painted marble-like. It seems like it is written to be misleading. I read the item description before purchasing and it does not mention what it is really made out of other than saying it is marble finish. If the marble finish was done well I would have still been satisfied. This is not the case, the darkly painted squares bleed into the lighter ones. The border edge paint is smeared or scratched. The item was also delivered 4 days later than their given estimation. I also found it odd that I did not get a written invoice or receipt with the item in the box, which has always occurred in all previous internet purchases. Unfortunately the other poor customer review was written 2 days after I ordered it or I would have gotten a different set."
3,The book was good but average plot.,"The book was well wtitten even though this is a similar plot in many romances(dark man hides hurtful past from the great woman in his life),but I found myself warming to the characters. If you like a romance thats like many others, this book is 4 you."
5,First Book Read-Favorite of All Time,The Black Lyon was the first romance novel I ever read and I must say it is one of THE BEST BOOKS EVER. I love in the beginning the relationship between Lyonene and Randulf and how happy they are together. During their stormy marriage Deveraux uses her excellent writing skills and really makes you either love or hate a character. The ending is so sweet and this is a book I will charish for all times!
1,I found it boring..,I expected a little more. I have read other stories by Jude. I liked A Knight In Shining Armor the best. Was a beautiful story..I'd like to add that the black lyon was not an attractive character at all. Another abusive man with a rug for a wife...
5,The Blaze Series,"We have two boys..very active and interested in horses. They have ponies too, so this fits perfectly. I read the Blaze series when I was a child and into horses and then read them to my oldest daughter who is still very much into her horse! Good series, highly recommend to any child interested in horses!"
5,Blaze Shows the Way,All Blaze books are great! My second grade daughter used to read these to me and I can't wait until my son can read them to me. They a classics for any kid who likes horses.
3,mediocre,This isn't his best book but I always love reading about the relationship between Gareth and Zeinab.
2,"Just the facts, ma'am","This guidebook is more of a ""super pamphlet"". It is about 3"" wide, 4"" tall, and 1.5"" thick with a glue tape binding. It is a well organized collation of USMC and DOD memos and instructional documents."
3,Cast Iron Cook Book,Looks like it holds alot of great americana cooking recipes. We will enjoy incorporating it in our lifestyle/cooking. thank you
4,Nice handy feeder,"I have not put it to use yet but got it for a backup unit for vacation time.However I did go through the setup and tried it as a test seems to work just fine, I do like the ability to select feeding times as well as frequencies this can be very usefull during short daylight hours, I am not sure about battery life however, I suspect it will depend on the frequency of daily use. I give it a 4star and not a 5 just for that uncertaintyArmand Hammer."
4,I enjoyed it,"I'm not a fan of animes nor have I ever seen one. But I decided to buy this movie because I love the Chronicles of Riddick series. I was very impressed by this film. Being an anime it was a different then watching just a regular film. The action and concepts were good. The storyline was interesting because it brought in items that are in the The Chronicles and explains why Riddick left Jack and Imam. I was very pleased to hear Rhiana Griffith's voice as Jack, which I was a disappointing factor in the actual sequel. The primary problem I found w/ this anime was the length. It would have been 5 stars if it were longer and went into Riddick actually leaving them on New Mecca. I recommend it for Pitch Black fanatics though. It completes the saga."
2,Is the Price worth it?,"This DVD reinforces the reason why people should read the information on the back of the box.I paid close to $20 for this DVD, and it was the biggest waste of money. After watching this movie and realizing that it only gave me 30 minutes of entertainment, I relized that I was seriously jipped.There aren't really any bonus features worth checking out on this DVD either.If you NEED to add this DVD to your collection, I seriously recommend you NOT paying anymore than $9.99 for it.Believe you me, you'll thank me later."
2,A Cartoon..Like Popeye.,"It's a lame cartoon.....and not even a good cartoon....just like Popeye, a dumb, cheap cartoon..boo!! I was glad it wasn't any longer than 35 minutes. And in no way this should be considered a sequel."
5,21Things I Wish My Broker Had Told Me,We keep this book on hand in each of our real estate office locations as a must read. We use this book a education for our newly licensed agents.
5,great book for begginer REALTORS,"Frank is a great guy, this book tells you some of the things you have to sort of 'figure out yourself' highly reccomend it"
2,You have heard it all before!!,"This book is attractive due to the title, however, it was a great disappointment. Everything in the book are things that a typical broker would tell you. All of the examples and advice are very general, except for one or two good points. What I found particularly interesting is the author's take on ""fair housing"" issues. The author, who is obviously not a minority, gives the advice that ""one should walk away"" if someone made a comment regarding letting a ""minority"" move into a property you are selling. That is true..However, what if you as the Real Estate Agent (and not the client) happens to be Black (or Hispanic or Jewish)?<-THIS IS HOW IT IS IN THE BOOKThere are more ways to view an issue. Maybe he should have consulted an agent that happens to belong to the Black (or Hispanic or Jewish) population for assistance with this topic."
5,Nice textbook,This textbook is layed out great. Great price. Great information. Great deal. If anyone is looking for a good marketing book for this profession-- this is it
4,Gives a good overview,"This is a good if simplistic book about the strategic mistakes Nazi Germany made during the war. It is not really intended for academic study. The author at times brushes off the contemporary logic of Hitler's moves and relies on hindsight as in ""It was a bad move because it didn't work out."" His analysis of the Battle of Britain is just off. Britain was in no real danger of invasion because of its massive naval superiority nor was it in real danger of losing air superiority in Southern England given that it could pull its squadrons north to rest and refit. More interesting are the possibilities of German expansion into the Middle East via Turkey which could have been a game changer. The author's view is that even as late as 1943, Germany could have still won a stalemate is an interesting hypothesis."
3,this guitar needs work,"what can i say the intonation was way off. the tune-a-matic bridge has a poor design, you can't get the saddle far back enough because the bolts eventually hit the strings... someone here suggested a bolt cutter which is a good idea? i found a computer screw laying around and it fit so the saddle is as far back as possible on the low E and it barely hit the intonation i mean it has to be as far back as possible! anyway after replacing the top two bolts the intonation was perfect. now onto the wiring... when i turn up the volume it crackles... it crackles when i turn the tone and switch the pickup selector! also when strumming hard enough the tune-a-matic bridge rattles a little. these problems are not enough for me to send the guitar back as it plays fine and sounds great as long as i don't move the knobs or switch. for $99 i would say buy the Epiphone LP Junior Special Electric Guitar Ebony currently at $99 Epiphone LP Junior Special Electric Guitar Ebony"
3,Rival CZF580,The fryer is a very good product. The only setback I have found is trying to find the replacement filters.
4,good product,"I am enjoying my rival.there isnt anything in this world thats perfect but this item is pretty close.have cooked fish,tater tots,onion rings,fries and shrimp and all came out very good.its big enough to feed my family of three easily and we had a really fun time making it.i say go to some cooking stores and look at the product your interested then once youve found what you like then order it online for the cost savings.and then enjoy.....obe...."
4,Play it Loud & Get on the Dance Floor!,"this album is great!!!! However, you've got to listen to it loud. play it loud and get ready to boogie......its the only way to appreciate it. the opening track, 'Momma told me', is a masterpiece on the dancefloor......'on my mind' is hot, so is 'uptown', 'female intuition', 'spin me', 'body music' and 'passion'.........gems to be enjoyed. so much so, that the biggest single off the album, 'just say hey', isn't even among the best."
1,Sensational Title,"Pretty much only a sensational title. The content of the book contained some common sense items most people should be able to figure out on their own. Really nothing new revealed. After reading I felt the title was created soley for marketing reasons and didn't feel it was worth the money. Purchasing this book was a really bad investment! I don't suggest purchasing, save your money."
3,Strange,"Wire Train was, along with The Del-Lords, the best American rock'n'roll band of the eighties. So why did Columbia leave off their best song ( ""Love Against Me"" ), and include a completely different and vastly inferior reworking of their second best song ( ""The Last Perfect Thing"" )? What were they thinking? Stick to ""In A Chamber/Between Two Worlds."
2,need replacement,The first dvd of dawn anna would not play on any of my machines. I was promised a new one but have not received it to date. so I cant really give an oppinion at this time.
5,Pleased,"The product arrived very quickly, and before the date given. It did jump once during the movie, but it's also used and that should be expected. I was very pleased and would buy from this seller again."
1,defective,"I bought 11"" saute pans which became defective after 1-2 month use. I have not contacted the company yet but I am going to."
1,rainex glass cleaner,This is the worst glass cleaner I have ever used. Left streaks and a film no matter how many cleaning things used. Like to have never got it off my classic car windshield. Stay away from this product!
2,gross,"Although a few 'older' ladies said I looked good, it is not a pattern that is flattering for any pregnant person. And note, the 'older' people liked it!"
3,A useful book... Just for advanced...,"Well, this dictionary it's useful, but just for the people that already know japanese, in other way, it's just another dicctionary of the bunch. It's isn't a dictionary that engages you to take a text, and begin to translate with it, That's impossible with this dictionary. But by other way this book it's very cheap, and as a dictionary, it can improve your vocabulary... Just that."
4,Great story for the YA,"wow, I read this book as a teenager, YEARS ago, and the plot and characters have always stuck with me. The book was a part of a YA romance book line, and I practically read all of them. However, Sharing Sam stood out as original, moving and movie worthy. Maybe there has been a movie like this, but can't think of it right now. Anyways, this book is perfect for anyone i think - it's clean, some angst, heartfelt and romantic. too bad there isn't a kindle version so I can add it to my shelf."
5,Awesome Cheesecake!!!,I have tried many cheesecake recipes in the past for various events... some better than others. I baked the New York style Cheesecake recipe in this book for a large dinner party and could not believe how awesome it turned out. Nothing but Kudo's!!!
4,Some of the Best Short Stories There Are,"Not too many short stories catch the eye and the imagination as do these by Noel Loomis. What prompted me to buy this book was the interesting titles of these stories, especially 'The Man Who Had No Thumbs' and 'The Stick and the Bearded Lady'. The only other titles by Mr. Loomis I have in my collection are books based on TV shows--Bonanza and Have Gun Will Travel--and both are good, but these short works do indeed show his masterful touch with the genre. It takes a special writer to capture character and setting in a limited amount of space, and Noel Loomis can do that. Historical detail is not neglected as well, and I like that in a book. I would not hesitate to buy this book if you like ""western"" fiction of any length."
4,Great Climber but not easy to assemble.,We bought this for our 2 year old little boy and he absolutely loves it. He really likes the tunnel and tall slide. He also likes to pretend with the steering wheel. My husband was more than a little frustrated at times while assembling it but after it was all said and done he was happy to see that our little guy loves it. We also got a free sand box which our son also enjoys.
2,very DECENT,"im on the fence about this one...it has lots of artwork, but hte art on the disk are clearly scans, and not even great ones- they didnt bother to use descreen filers. this is also a very old product, and there were 3-4 corrupted files on the disc, which took some work to figure out exactly which ones.the worst thing however, is that it is simply a picture book- there is no description of ANY of them. i wanted to know why certain animals and elements were used, and i am left to search ou t yet another book like this for satisfaction. know you waht, im giving this a 2, a 3 is too good. update this book NOW."
5,Armand LaMontagne DVD,Armand LaMontagne is an American woodworking and art hero and deserves our attention and admiration. We need more like him. As a craftsman I recomend this to all woodworkers and artists as he is as important to us as any great leader in these fields.
1,Over rated,"Nothing new, no insights, just a book some average college professor has to write to say he ""published"". I hope this guy isn't tenured at UT - because the students are going to get a big dose of Darwinism/Atheism and no physics info - just bios and his opinion."
5,I love her voice,neicy's voice makes me thank God that he created women still she was one of my favorite female singers gonna take a miracle is still fresh to this day and free the ever loving classic man neicy be singing her behind off and one of the best singers this world produced too bad this stuff is illegal now.
5,I Love It,I'm so glad to have this as part of my CD collection. It is a great buy as she is one of my favorite singers.
1,horrible taste and bad packaging,"For $28, I could have gotten a pile of lip gloss at the local drugstore, with brushes. Why does Pixie not make room in the pallete for a brush?? You have to carry it seperately.The taste of this gloss is horrible, the pans are shallow (so you will run out quickly) and the colors are all the same pinky-red with no debth. Thumbs down..."
3,There is better stuff out there...,"This work is hardly original. The material finds a much richer context and more nuanced analysis in Brief History of Everything (Ken Wiber)and in the work of Robert Kegan, Clare Graves, Susan Cook-Greuter and other developmentalists. The Cultural Creatives is essentially a popularization an sensationalization of this deeper developmental analysis by true scholars and is consequently shot through with the over-simplifications, hyperbole and blanket generalizations that characterize most works of this ilk. The books mentioned above show where the ""cultural creatives"" fit in the overall scheme of developmental research and they also reflect the developmental levels that emerge after those of cultural creatives."
2,In its time,"In its time, probably one of the most definitive texts in the genre. Now, somewhat dated and out of print, it stil serves as a strong historical reference though perhaps more appropriate reading for poets & pirates rather than orthopods."
2,"Oh, my...","""The Trial of a Time Lord"" was a controversial period in the history of Doctor Who. Not only did the story cause a lot of problems with Who continuity, but there was also the added irony that the show was on trial as well (the BBC came close to canceling it that season).In my opinion, one of the major problems with Who during this time was the pulpy, badly plotted stories of Pip and Jane Baker. How they managed to to write so many Who scripts is beyond me. If anything, their work novelizing their own scripts was even worse. They manage to incorporate every pulpy, said-bookism cliche possible. Luckily the Target novelizations are only 120 pages long, so Who fans can sail through this book without too much pain, all the time wishing that someone would break P&J Baker's exclamation mark key."
2,Definitely no Amelie,"...and not worthy of all of the effusive praise by critics. Not visually interesting,unphilosophical,draggy,the young lady is charming but this is one of those rare times that award committees have completely and utterly failed in their duty. It isn't total crap, but it's a very weak art film."
4,harper is holly.,brillant. this man's tallent is undescribeable. put it on and kick back to the mellow tunes of harper. i recomend listening to it whilst chilling on the coast.
2,Very dissapointed,"Ben Harper was brought to my attention through his association with Jack Johnson. Then Direct TV showed Ben Harper this month on their free concert. I only saw part of the show and decided to buy Live from Mars as my first (and last) Ben Harper CD. I can't get into his music...it doesn't have any flow. His guitar playing is mediocre at best, and his vocals even worse. At times I thought Tiny Tim had come back from the dead. I'll stick with Jack Johnson. Ben Harper was not what I expected, and I utterly fail to see what all the hype is about."
4,decent bike rack,relatively easy to install but would be better if it came with straps or other bungie type cord for carrying items
5,"Sturdy, Perfect Fit","This rack fit right on to my Trek 4500 frame with existing bolt locations. Rack is sturdy and works great. I typically use it with theTopeak MTX Trunk Bag DXP-- clicks right into place. In addition to the Topeak brand Trunk Bag, I have now also used the rack with standard rear panniers (non-Topeak bags that hook along the top and bottom) -- using these additional bags simultaneously with the Topeak sliding trunk bag is not possible, however.Very happy with the rack, am picking up a second for a second bike (a Trek 3700 -- will fit directly on this bike as well)."
4,"Sturdy, Light, and Funcional","I love the Topeak QuickTrack system. I have two bags of different sizes, one for commuting to work, and one for recreational trips. This rack, in conjuction with the bags, is a very sturdy and convient way to carry what I need for the day. I'm not sure this is the best rack for the money if you don't buy into the whole system, but buying into the whole system is exactly what I would recommend. It is not cheap, but the convience and security has made me a fan of Topeak products. I just bought a second rack to mount on my latest bike. Other than normal wear from years of use, my old rack is going strong."
5,Topeak Explorer Bike Rack...Fantastic,"Purchased this rack system for my wife's new bicycle. It was easy to install. Later I ordered the Topeak MTX bag that slides on a rail attaching to the rack. It is a great system, good price and most importantly, the wife is happy with it. I recommend this product for a person looking for a good system to carry their stuff on bike rides."
5,"easy install, great system","I installed this rack in less than 30 minutes with no problems, armed only with an allen wrench. The bag I got fits very well on it and quite securely. I've only done one ride with it so far, but I forsee no issues. Great idea, Topeak!"
3,Not for Disk brake bikes.,"I ordered this since I ride my bike to work. I didn't realize it was for the old style of bike brakes. My bike as disk brakes. The instructions did have a picture of the correct rack for my bike. So if your order this make sure you get the correct one for your style of bike. I am going to keep it and mount it on my girlfriends bike since she has the old style. Besides that, it's a great product."
4,"5mm Screws, 6mm Sockets","I bought this to add to a brand-new Currie Traliz Enlightened electric bike. When I tried to install it in the ready-made threaded sockets on the bike frame, I discovered that the 5mm screws were too small. The sockets are 6mm. So I got some 6mm screws, but then had to drill out two holes on the frame of the rack to accommodate the larger screws. This worked, but I'm a bit worried that the rack might be weakened. I don't know how many bikes are using 6mm threaded sockets, but I know there's at least one. Other than this wrinkle, the rack works fine and I'm pleased with it."
3,Tough to install but good,"Once installed, the rack is great and very functional. I had trouble installing it on my older model Univega. I needed to drill out the holes on the support bars to make them big enough to fit with my seat post bolt. Not that difficult to do, but i definitely would prefer an install that didn't require me to modify the product."
3,Won't fit smaller frames,"I bought this rack hoping it'd work well on my small-frame road bike. Unfortunately, even after some pretty skillful time spent with a hammer I wasn't able to bend the support bar enough to clear my brakes. It's currently jury rigged onto my bike and working well enough, but I'm replacing it soon."
5,Nice product. Will be getting the accessories,I got this for my Trek Hybrid 7000. Came with everything needed. Nice polished alan bolts. Mounted in 15 minutes. I think I will be getting either the foldaway crate or the basket to go along with it. oh and thinking about the redlite to attach to the bracket on back.It seems very sturdy. You can tell it's good quality. Topeak makes a good product. I have one of their water bottle cages as well. Very nice stuff.
5,Great for the classroom,The students in my classroom enjoyed this book. It gave them a great overview of the content we had been studying. It can be used at the beginning of a unit or as a review.
3,OK,I bought these for a percussion class in college and the teacher told me they weren't heavy enough for a real player. I am still using them though.
4,Insecurities of infedelity,"FEELING THE HURT, HEALING THE HEART is the story of a woman who, on top of all the stresses of life, choses to continue living with her cheating husband. It feels as if you are reading her diary and viewing not only day to day stresses but the insecurities she has developed and tries to overcome due to her husbands infedelity.Reading this book I felt very frustrated with the choices she repeatedly made. I could also see that even though her choices would not be the same as mine, that some people just seem to choose to take the harder road in life. I could not say that the book was uplifting but it was insightful.C.J. WilkesDaddy, I Forgive You"
4,Great,I am an old fashioned Baptist preacher and this book is a great help in my studies of the Old Testament. It is also a very helpful book as a textbook for my Bible college students.
4,Very emotional songs about losing someone or something,This is one of my favorite picks of Damien Jurado's. I've listened to his other cd and several of his seven inches released on sub-pop. This is a very mature record that I wouldn't recommend listening to if your going through a break up or something like that. It's a great album with Ohio starting out very emotionally. You can't help but feel for the young girl in the song. I definetly think this album was more focused than was Water Ave. S. although that by it's own rights is a great album. Great Job Damien.
2,ok but didn't thrill me,"This is the sequel to Virtual Heaven. I liked the first book ok enough to get the second. I wasn't very impressed with the book. Its the story of Gwen, who runs the virtual reality store where the Game the Tolmac Wars Two is played. the Hero is Vad who we meet in the first book. He is on a quest that he must to to regain his honor. Somehow he is thrust from the game into Gwen's reality. There are some cute scenes while he is in her reality but soon we find them back in the game. Together they must overcome a lot of emotional hangups before they can get together. Not to mention all the problems that keep them in constant trouble and fighting for their very lives. I wish these books had a bit more humor in them."
1,"You get what you pay for, obviously...","I bought this book... as it is my intention to buy a replacement for it as soon as possible.I have taken all of the GED pretests in this book. That is where I am going to stop. Along with errors, it is my opinion that the passages they give you to read from often do not give ample detail for the questions afterward, and in a few cases none at all. I will give examples upon request via e-mail if anyone would like.I read approximately 500 pages a week as a pastime, and have been a writer for 13 years- I just didn't get my high school diploma. I still scored well on these tests, as well as can be expected, but have scored significantly higher on other books. I believe this is due to others having questions that better pertain to the information given."
2,No substitute for USA made,"Bought it, and sold it. I'll get a USA made or an antique for the same price. I'm getting sick of 2nd rate Chinese stuff, and will take the hit cost wise to get a quality made unit from the US."
4,Sad to leave the book,"I'm a bit disturbed by how much I loved this book. Most of the plot is predictable and it's certainly not fine literature but the writing is good overall. I have to disagree with the reviewer from Publishers Weekly when he says that Diamond Girl has a bad case of Stockholm Syndrome - it's much more complex than that. Diamond Girl really takes the book from mediocre to very, very good - the author leaves the reader constantly wondering about her psychology and motivations but doesn't clear it up until the end. I missed the book when it was over."
5,dearborn the best,"Took my series 7 exam today (6/21/04)( 84%). I read Barrons, Arco and Dearborn.Dearborn was clearly the best hands down. They had great studying tips, easy to read format, you CAN pass the test with this book alone. Just cover everything, answer every practice question, use the disc and there will be no surprises. Arco was OK, but compared to Dearborn it doesn't hold a candle. I was initially a bit worried because I had the 12th edition ( 3 yrs. old) but it didn't matter. Good luck to all..."
1,awful is a generous review,emmanuel pahud is phony as it comes. how can one play so well and achieve so little? for one who spends half the reicital oogling at girls in the audience and making phallic flute gestures you'd think he'd have some spark in his music. not to be. save your money.
1,A bit too pre-concieved,"Maybe if we saw the 'before' pictures we could believe these guys... the 'before we were goth' pics, the 'when we wanted to be hip-hoppers and before we became post-punk' pics. It wasn't that long ago, just 3 years. Unfortunately that kind of genre hopping smells of following the money rather than your musical skills.Sorry mates, don't pose in your pics like you're cool and edgey, there's nothing remotely original here - if you're gonna genre hop and rehash, don't act like you're cool and moody - these days the fakes are easy to spot."
2,Unlike Cook,"Although this book is written with the same Cook preciseness and great flow, It lacked a ""finess"" that I associate with Cook's novels. Although the plot is intresting and very well flowing, It was to ""predictable"". The amazing nailbiting suspense in Coma and his more recent novels (Contagion, Terminal) is lacking here. If you love that nailbiting suspense, read Coma or Contagion. This is not Cook's best... -TT"
4,GREAT STORY!,"One of the best mystery stories I have ever read. Did not give it a 5* rating only because some may find the topic of Nazi Germany depressing. Even so, the story deals with the inner workings of Hitler's regime, and not so much with interment camps and their treatment of Jewish prisoners."
2,Wouldn't pay $75 for it,"I bought this because I made my own baby food, and needed something to it keep cool. It worked great for about the first month, then seemed to fall apart. The stitching came apart on one of the buckles on the shoulder straps; that ended up coming apart. And the seem came apart on the back of the back pack. I wasn't rough with it, and used it as a 'normal' baby bag. It seemed like it was made cheap, and not what I expected for a $75 product. The idea and the function of the back pack is great, but the quality is poor. I ended up returning it."
1,"POOR QUALITY, DO NOT BUY THIS BAG","Got this about 7 weeks ago and it is already started to rip from seams and falling a part, poor quality, DO NOT BUY this bag, instead buy something from walmart or any other store. This is expensive and really bad quality bag."
1,Poorly made and doesn't hold much,"I researched this bag as I wanted a backpack type bag to free up my hands and to use on our trip to San Francisco. It was highly recommended in a family travel blog. First of all, I noticed that it did not hold as much as was advertised. It has a lot of room for food, but I had a hard time fitting in the basics (change of clothes, diapers, and cleaning supplies). It does have a lot of pockets, but I would have valued more space INSIDE of the bag instead of tiny little compartments. I do not stuff a diaper bag with everything I can think of. While we were on our trip, we noticed that the straps and the pull strings were fraying from ordinary use! Very poorly made. Not worth the high price tag of $75. It was comfortable to walk around with, but was so bulky that I bumped into everyone with the bag.It also rubbed my clothes to the point that I had a hold in a cami and ruined a sweater. Worse purchase I've ever made."
1,give me shelter,"A complete waste of money. I bought this book because I loved the buildings in it and all i got was some photo-shopped nonsense by a fool. You can't even really get a good look at the buildings, since that doesn't forward Eisenman's theories. I'll never again buy anything with Eisenman's name on it. The book took forty years because he has nothing interesting to say and his ego only just got big enough to publish those nothings. Seriously, the book offers no new understanding of these buildings, it just makes you wish architects studied construction and not theory. You can't live in a theory."
5,Stargate Atlantis season 3,"Excellent, love the show. Hope it lasts for years as did stargate sg-1. Reccomend all 3 seasons to own and watch."
4,Atlantis starts to show its spark,"After 2 seasons of plodding along, Atlantis really picks up for its 3rd season.Characters start to feel more fleshed out, with developments in their lifes and not feeling like the cardboard cut outs of the previous 2 seasons.I wont give away any of the plots etc but there are a good couple of running b plots that show up every now and then, something season one and two had a lack of.IN short, if you had given up on atlantis, season 3 is worth watching as it almost feels like its started again afresh."
5,A great Byrds album,Turn turn turn is one of the finest albums from the Byrds which contains some of the finest songs from the awesome title track.This superb album also features some great remastered extra tracks and is highly recommended.
5,Don't Turn Down The Chance To Own This Classic.,"1965 saw the birth of The Byrds with Mr Tambourine Man and quickly followed by Turn, Turn Turn.The Byrds, Bob Dylan and others ushered in folk/rock which has had a massive effect on the music scene ever since.The title track is good enough for 5 stars and the rest are'nt far behind.There are 3 Dylan songs, Lay Down Your Weary Tune, The Times They Are A-Changin' and, as a bonus track, It's All Over Now, Baby Blue, all done inthe Byrds jingle jangle guitar style.There are 2 folk songs with some adjustments, He Was A Friend Of Mine and Satisfied Mind.Gene Clark again contributes excellent songs, all in all The Byrds were flying high from their earliest recordings."
5,Absolutely Hilarious!,"This is an absolutely hilarious parody of personal ads. You can't help but laugh out loud at this very funny book. It does contain explicit content, though, so this one isn't for the kiddies!!"
2,like watching some kind of bad romance with a vampire hybrid,I totally did not get what Louis Garrel was doing with this unpleasant and pretentious woman who was not only suicidal but an arsonist with no consideration for property owners!
4,Good general overview of Business Intelligence projects,"I bought this book to prepare for my Certified Business Intelligence Professional (CBIP) certification exam. It covers the whole spectrum of the Business Intelligence projects. It offers many practical and result oriented guidelines and tips. Due to the very large breath of subject covered, it doesn't go too deep into some specific areas - but it gives you a good general overview. Despite being almost 10 years old, the topics covered are relatively general so still very applicable today."
4,Spurs' Championship...2005 DVD,"I personally recommend this DVD to any Spur's fan. It is a good DVD. It does not have all the 4th quarters for the clinching of each series, but it has the 4th quarter of the final game 7.The special features are great, and the docummentary is good; more than an hour.Hope this helps. Take care. GO SPURS GO!"
2,"A case book, not a textbook","This book was a disappointment. A real textbook would actually have instruction. This book is merely a collection of cases, with a few scattered chapters on VC/PE. Only buy the book if required to for a class."
5,Still Incredible After All These Years,"This is one of my all-time favorite albums. What a group! Soaring harmonies, rock-bottom bass, a ringing 12-string Rickenbacker, incredible original songwriting, and super Dylan covers. This band was extremely influential, from the Beatles, to Tom Petty, to R.E.M.I love it, love it, love it!"
5,Absolute classic,"This is the real classic music, no doubt about it. Lots and lots of good songs in a single album. ""Mr. Tambourine man"" by byrds is much better sounding than its writer's version. The ""Chimes of freedom"" is another Dylan song sung beautifully by David Crosby. I mean all the songs in these album are great. SAfe buy, I would say."
2,Not original. Free on the internet. Not very useful.,"I had already downloaded ""The Other Side of the Mountain"" and read it. Nowhere on this site is it mentioned that this book is simply a reprinting of that ""FREE"" work. It was not even spell checked or edited. Do a search and download the original. If you THEN want a printed copy, order this one. The only thing new and improved is the very nice cover.The book is basically about 94 very short and dry retellings of small battles between the two adversaries. Not much is useful or educational. Not even entertaining. I was looking for education and enterntainment.There is another FREE companion piece called ""The Bear Went Over The Mountain"". Do a web search on each and download.-Copernic.com is the best web searcher I've found."
5,these sisters are the baddest female group ever,"i Love the Emotions voices.they have power&soul.and with the Genius of Maurice White they created many great songs such as best of my love,I don't wanna lose your Love,Smile.i have never heard another female group that can hang vocally with them.they are the baddest of all-time.i hope they release something new.and maybe get back with Maurice White."
3,The Emotions,This CD brought back so many happy memories of the late 70's and early 80's. would reccomend to anyone and everyone
3,emotions,"the emotions and disco rules...and oh by the way, why are so many words required to review an item, REALLY?"
4,Nice house coat,I bought this house coat for my mom and she likes it very much. I bought a large and at first she thought it would be too small but it was fine.
2,A Real Stumble For E.J.,"I've been an E.J. fanatic for a long time. I've owned everything he's put out with the exception of Victim Of Love (I think I can be forgiven for that). I find this this album to be adult contemporary elevator music at it's worst. I wanted so much to love this album---and I tried---I really tried.Yes, the single, ""Something About The Way..."" is catchy and is the saving grace of this album. Another great song is the haunting, ""Long Way From Happiness."" Other than that though, I find this work completly forgetable. It is nowhere NEAR the same league as some of his earlier releases like ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" or ""Honky Chateau.""Luckily, from his next album releases, ""Songs From The West Coast"", ""Peachtree Road"", and now ""Captain & The Kid"", we now know Elton hadn't totally lost his edge. After first hearing this dud, I feared he had. If you have a hankering for some newer E.J. masterpieces, avoid this CD and go for one of the previously mentioned."
5,"SilverHawks, Vol.1",I love this cartoon just as Thundercats they look similar to each other but they are both the same to storyline.
5,That's awesome,I've been waiting forever for silverhawks so when I saw it on amazon I was espcially happy and ordered it right away....It arrived in about 4-5 days so naturally I appreciate the speed in which I was able to watch one of my favorite childhood cartoons!Thanks!
2,"Worked fine until the ""locking"" position broke.","I'm pretty disappointed in the quality of this cable. It worked great for the first couple of uses, then when I went to put it in the locking position one day. The handle just kept spinning. So it's pretty much useless now. Just really cheap quality in my opinion. Really poor finish on the handle too. I would spend a little more & get something better than this junk."
5,Something For Everyone.,"I give this album a five star rating.Anthoney Burger has won the best piano players award five years in a row since he started playing gospel music.The reason I gave this album a five star rating is the selection of songs that it offers,there is at least one or two songs in it that everyone will enjoy.I listen to his music very closely and I have never heard him make a mistake.some times you would think there were two piano players.I highly recomend this album to all music lovers. Neal Allison."
4,a phenomenal description of love-sickness,"I agree with the first reviewer that this books is disturbing and depressing. Clearly this is not the author's finest hour as a person. But what saved it for me was that as an author, Millet really does shine. She captures the truth of being the one who loves and needs more, and it IS painful. I found this book fascinating."
2,Rival VS125-S Seal-a-Meal,This product doesn't live up to its claims. You have to hold the lid down tight since the lock only works on one side and the little place where you put the bag over for suction doesn't stay down so that it vacuums well. It doesn't vacuum all of the air out and the bags are still loose when you're finished. Shop around for a better value.
3,MIni Cooper car cover,"My wife has a Mini Cooper and I thought this would be a great gift for her, but it has been difficult for her to put on by herself. There is no opening to allow for the antenna, so she will either have to remove the antenna, no problem, or I will take it to an Upholstery shop and have an opening made to allow placement over the antenna."
4,CD2 alone is worth the price,"Hearing these versions of Token Of Your Love and Teenage Dream makes you wish there were more ""live"" T. Rex available from this era. These two songs alone are worth the price. A video of this gig would have been great to see."
3,"Works Ok, But Doesn't Lasts Long.","I tried this thinking it would put a little ""spice"" back into my life. It gives a good sensation, but fades quickly. I also wish it had a better smell. I probably would not buy it again."
2,Does nothing for me,"It didn't excite me one tiny bit & I'm so disappointed. It's not terribly warming though, which I was NOT wanting, so that's a good point. It feels very minty & doesn't help nor hinder me. For me, it was not worth it."
4,war and local color,"Rinaldi's novel is a WW II story set on Malta. I am not especially into local color, and war stories generally bore me to death. But I loved this book. The Malta depicted here is a genuinely intriguing exotic locale, and its depiction of the courage of its inhabitants in a very dangerous situation rings very true. Rinaldi has a real gift for characterization and a real eye for eccentric behavior--the action sometimes seems surreal, and yet based in the most concrete observation. The novel is funny and moving without ever condescending to its characters or their situation in the manner of so much local color. The Fox"
2,2 and a half.,"i love the dwarves,so the rating may be a bit misleading.its not THAT bad,but its extremely repetitive.there is a good standout song here and there,but it sounds like they were burnt out creativly(if not in other ways).the sound is good,but the vocals,a big part of the bands sound, is lost in the mix.it sounds like one note being played over and over.i mean, the dwarves cant make a bad album doing the kind of ""music"" they do,but this is a weak one.check it out and see for yourself."
3,Sextetless!,"This recording ought to come with a warning label: it has been butchered beyond belief! Not only does is cut the end of the mad-scene (as the program notes remark) but it also omits ""Che mi frena!"" (an omission that the program notes ignore). ""Lucia"" without the Sextet (no matter how much of a warhorse some may find it) is like Damon without Pythias; Holmes without Watson; bacon without eggs.The sound quality is also disturbing enough to occlude Callas' diction (although her voice in ""Ardon l'incensi"" and ""Spargi d'amaro pianto"" shines through in its limpidity). I was also very disappointed that Giuseppe di Stefano did not use his sublime mezza voce in the heartrending ""Tu che a Dio spiegasti l'ali,"" which he did in a cassette recording with Callas that I bought in Italy (Infuriatingly, I lost it in moving!).As one reviewer remarked, this disc is a ""reference"" recording; a footnote, as it were. But without the Sextet, the citation remains incomplete."
3,sugar dispenser,"This is a great concept. It is alot easier to pour sugar than to scoop it. It works decently, but occasionally sugar clumps still block the pour spout. It kind of helps when I shake it up and then pour."
1,SugarDispenser,"I bought this container for an easy way to hold a 5lb bag of sugar/ However, the lid doesn't fit tight. Very disappointed"
5,"The Flatirons ""Prayer Bones"" makes you feel more alive.","--- And that's alive in a good way. ""Prayer Bones"" comes after many moons of waiting for a recording of The Flatirons. The band imagines an original understanding of jazz, rock, and country, and their sound is super. Comparable music: The Cowboy Junkies, Lucinda Williams, Chris Isaac, Alison Krauss, Gillian Welch, Warren Pash, and Pink Martini. Buy The Flatirons ""Prayer Bones"" NOW, listen to them over and over again (you'll want to!), and go see them live if you ever get the chance!"
2,Was somewhat let down,I got the book from the library to read because of all the great reviews about this book. It was written well and I praise the authors stories of the firefighters but it left me wanting to know something besides the firefighters. Just not what I thought the book would be!
4,An Absorbing and Honest Look At A Day Of Infamy,"By now it would be easy to expect a book with such a title to be an exploitative effort to mine our sentimental attachments to the events of last September, yet this slim volume is hardly that. Written by a career fireman who walked among those who fought the fire and who were lost, it really is a marvelous testament ot those who risked their lives for others. Far from being a rip-off, it is written as a tribute to those who walked among the ruins and either lived or died.It is full of anecdotal information about many of those who perished, but is also filled with descriptions of survivors who were ordinary people illustrating uncommon courage and compassion. Go get it and read it, but find a quiet private corner first. And bring the kleenex. Tears will flow, and you will still be glad that you read it. Enjoy!"
4,Impressive,Not as good as volume #1 but still amazing guitar playing and a great collaboration of other amazing musicians.
5,Allman working his magic,This CD has got some cool tracks. It's got some more of his solo work w/ Berry & Jamoie. It has a spectacular instrumental version of The Weight w/ King Curtis. Duane's slide work on this track will confirm is masterful touch. To end the CD is a rare live version of Midnight Rider from the Fillmore '71 shows.The interplay between Dickey and Duane is magical. There are too many highlights on this CD to mention here.If you are a Duane fan this CD is an essential.
2,only lasted 3 months,"It was great while it lasted, but it only lasted three months! I did not abuse it, but I did use it every night. It wasn't on all night as it turns itself off after two hours. I would have been my favorite if it hadn't died."
2,poor quality,already not working I only had a chance to use the product a few times then stop working. I am not sure what happen I just don't want to bother with it .
3,Not Warm Enough,"I bought this as a replacement for a heating pad that was ripping after several yeas of use. I like the power pad, no auto shut-off. The problem is that it doesn't get hot enough compared to others I've owned in the past."
4,Good Product,"Since I've never owned or used another one I don't really have anything to compare it with. I injured my back a few years ago and finally decided to purchase something to give me relief from the occasional pain I was feeling.....I went with this because of the reviews and that it was reasonably priced. I've used it on my shoulders and back and it's helped a lot, so that's all that matters to me!"
2,Extra Hot Heating Pad,"The box stated it had an automatic shut-off after 3 hours. However, mine does not. If you like an extra hot heating pad, this is the one for you! I usually use them on low or medium. The low setting on this one just about burns me to death!"
4,heating pads rule,So far so good! I like the long cord and the different heat settings provide different levels of comfort depending on your needs.My only reason for 4 not 5 is that the cover tries to sneak off of the pad...I'd wish for a better design.
4,Hydroblast is pretty decent.,"This product is quite good. It is huge and all filled up it probably weighs 15-20 pounds. So if you're alright with lugging it around, you should be quite pleased. It has power comparable to other leading soakers."
4,Attractive Book For Drinking Glasses Collectors,"This 136 page volume, with prices updated for 1999 features THOUSANDS of glasses, in full color photos. A nice overview and brief history of the hobby is included. Some major topics cover from: Artists and Producers, Characters and Personalities, Fast-Food Restaurants and Food Containers, to Americana, Space Related, Superheros and Sports. Each group of glasses includes photos, a description of the glasses along with a value range. Its completely indexed for ease of use. A must have for collectors of this topic. It carries a list price of $ 17.95."
2,Disappointing to say the least,"As fast as little ones grow out of their shoes, I did not want to spend a ton of money on new shoes for my son. These actually fit the bill for summmer foot wear. Against my better judgement I had purchased them anyways... when they finally arrived I was excited to get them! My son wore them 2 times and the ""Columbia"" emblems and writing was all but gone and the dark blue had gone to a lighter blue. I ended up going out and getting him another pair of sandles."
4,A Big Binder,"I had purchased another Binder over a year ago, like other couponers. Well, the rings in that Binder did not stay closed so your baseball card holders would get loose and I spent more time putting it back in the rings. This one has a lock feature which is a life saver for couponers. The only reason I gave it a 4 (four) star was the look of the Binder. I wish they had Bold colors."
1,Disappointing,"If you want a better version of this book, try Kevin Baker's Dreamland. I found Doctorow's style to be far inferior. Of course, mood can play a part, but my experience was simply disappointing.Try it out, but be prepared to cancel it before the seven days you are allowed. (Amazon doesn't make this public, but you may return a book in seven days, so you can get more than one chapter to make your decision)Also, this is an extremely sexually graphic book. Not to everyone's liking. Anyway not to mine.The book is iconic, but I found it boring. Hope you do too."
3,Required reading,"Of course my student only read this novel because it was required reading for History. For others purchasing this book for their student, be aware of the provocative language, imagery and just plain innappropriateness for kids. Interesting read."
1,so dry,"I don't like period pieces and this is an example. No offense, it just wasn't my taste. I don't think anyone in my bookclub loved this book."
4,A new reader to Ragtime,"Dear Amazon: Mostly this was a good buy for the No Name Book Club. I had hoped for less than $4.00 per item, but at the time I could not find that price, but just today I see .01 cent copies. The bad is as follows: One of the paperback books was badly marked up with several colors of highlighters and then comments written in ink on several pages. Nicely, Amazon refunded my money and shipping and said keep the book which I tossed in the trash. Your responder said they did not know how that book slipped into consumer's hands. Barbara PS Of course the book is outstanding!"
3,Takes flight once the 'slime' is exhausted,"I'm a little shocked that I ended up thinking well of this book after the way it started. Doctorow's slavish dedication to the most prurient aspects put me off so much I was ready to put it down. But there was just enough interest in the story line that I kept going, and overall it ended up being worth it.The prose style is choppy, sort of like Cormac McCarthy but without the paragraph spacing. The use of historical characters is believable and the storyline surrounding 'Coalhouse' Walker was gripping.Beyond the weird prose and the need to incorporate various descriptions of bodily fluids, I also didn't care for the appearance and then disappearance of characters that initially seemed to be 'main'. Certain aspects just seem unfinished, and this detracts from the overall strength of the work.So, a qualified recommendation, but despite the warts, a worthwhile read."
3,ding,Product was fine as a used condition item. The time it took to get it delivered was unconscionably long!!
2,Its tearing up my heart...,"People are hailing this like a great punk album. Okay, if you don't think this sounds along the lines of Blink-182, Fall Out Boy, Taking Back Sunday, and everything else in the uber-pop realm, you are suffering from severe denial. The only difference is these guys have breakdowns. However, If you like that style, then cool, they do it better that the other mentioned bands.Keep in mind that this MTV friendly Post-Punk pop is what killed Skate Punk, and some of us are not forgiving. Part of the punk rock scene was not giving way to accessible radio-friendly tunes. But for me, if I am going to listen to power-pop, I'm going to go all the way and just jam to someN Sync."
3,"interesting ideas, too many examples",Great book. It could have been shorter as it has too many examples.There is another neat book Discipline of market leaders that I recommend. This one kinda expands on the product leadership side of the value.
4,"Thesis is right on, but you don't need the whole book.",The 'Disruptive Technology' thesis is right on. The introduction tells you the whole story. The first 3 chapters help provide examples to support the thesis. After that the remaining chapters continue with academic minutia.
2,Couldn't all agree,"The biggest problems are the apparent survivor bias. Does anyone know how many of these trders are still around actually trading. If they are still doing what they said in the book, some of them should be real heros in the dotcom franzy. But haven't heard of any.There are occasionally some wisdom come up among pages, but most likely you already heard of them thousands of times. Like ""Risk control"", ""Cut your loss short"" ... Even if these wisdom origionally came from this book, but still not worth the time reading it. Sorry"
5,A must have..,I found this book inspiring and one which i will read again and again.It really set in stone my desire to become a trader. Cannot rate it highly enough.
4,Very Useful,"It has been very useful and important reading this book. I think every trader or the one who wants to be it should read this series of interviews. I thought I was the only one who felt and experimented all the pain, doubt and all kind of experiences when trading but I see that even the great traders have felt the same in some moment. I see that is part of the process of learning although you never stop learning. A lot of tips and ways of trading are shown in this book that will be of great help for those who read the book. I strongly recommend it."
1,Bad Interview,Marty Schwartz doesn't answer any questions and this is not an interview as represented. It is just some guy reading stuff from Marty's book The Pit Bull which I highly rate and would recommend to anyone. This is a total waste of money and a ripoff - nothing new here.
4,MARKET WIZARDRY,"One main thing I learned from this book is that alldecent approaches work. What is important is tofind the one that suits you. Over-diversificationworks. So does little diversification. FundamentalAnalysis works. So does Technical Analysis. Sodoes Fundamental with Technical Analysis. Pickignthe middle of a trend works. So does picking topsand bottoms.A commonality in all the interviewed traders seem tobe good money and risk control: Keep your tradessmall, especially for new traders.8 Feb 11"
1,super abridged,"I made a huge mistake getting this one. It should say ""Market Wizard"" and not ""wizardS"". It would be much better and cost effective to get the whole book, than this very small part of it. I will not make such a mistake again. Waste of money."
4,A decent skimmer,"The interview format necessitates great wordiness. So, with a book like this, one tends to skim for nuggets. I found a couple that apply to me. Perhaps you will too."
4,Very Interesting Read,"Anyone who is interested in learning about investing, or starting a career in investing/trading, should read this book, if nothing more than to get up to speed with who the legendary traders are!"
4,Timeless Market Insights,I am still enjoying the read - the book has produced some useful insights and is living up to expectations even the material is ~ 30 years old
1,worst toy ever,"I would never have bought this for my sons. Unfortunately, certain relatives felt otherwise. My entire house has stunk for two days like rotting food and I can't get rid of the smell. The stench wakes me in the middle of the night. I can't invite people into my home. I can't open the windows because it's snowing outside. Air fresheners don't work. This is a vile, thoughtless, evil, ridiculously malicious toy. Buy it if you really want to ruin someone else's week and/or reduce him/her to tears. In which case, you should probably also remember what they say about karma."
2,Funny but not helpful,"I don't think this book was meant to be funny but I thought it was hilarious because I could have wrote it! LOL. Anyways I checked this out of the library and I knew it probably would be bad because it was written like 15 years ago and boy things have changed since then. To go on , I didn't even finish the book because it just harps on all the types of things your kids can be spoiled with and how they act. Well duh, that is common sense. I have an easy solution on how to change spoiled kids , stop buying them stuff! Yes, it may be annoying to hear them scream or cry or whatever but as adults we have the power. So enough of my ranting, the book just boils down to common sense and amateur writing. Pass on this one."
4,"GREAT BILLIE, poor sound...","I think it's a good selection of tracks, played wonderfully by Billie, but most of them are not remastered. For the edition, one star less, but all the stars, infinite, to Billie."
3,If you like National Geographic..............,"If you like National Geographic specials, you'll love this. It captures everything you expect from Nat'l Geo.--beautiful visuals, stunning photography, gorgeous scenery, little depth. If you read GG&S, and expect this to be a Nova-, BBC-, or even PBS-class presentation of a scientific theory, you will be disappointed."
3,Judeo Christian ethic not mentioned,"I enjoyed the documentary. I would add the influence of the Judeo Christian ethic to the contributing forces in western civilization and why it has been so successful. Work ethic, morality, system of laws, and temperance have helped to create an environment conducive to advancing technology."
2,Not as good as I hoped!,"I had just finished the book, when I learned this DVD set was available. Much like almost every movie adapted from a book, many details and material need be left out. If you read the book, don't bother with this. If you haven't read the book, this DVD might lead you to read the book. It was good to see what Jared Diamond looks like, as well as the people and terrain of New Guinea."
5,A Great Edition to Any Star Wars Collection,"I think this was a really well written story, whose characters were well thought out. I really hope the Dark Horse Comics does more this Time Period in the Star Wars Timeline."
5,I love this workout!,"I've been using the tape for almost 3 months. I can see changes to my stomach and buttocks already. I have lost about 6 lbs without a diet, I have more stamina and I feel great. What's amazing, is that the workout isn't difficult. In fact at first I didn't think it could work, because I wasn't in pain during my workout like I was with other taped programs. I have so many tapes and I've taken so many classes. I have found a program that works for me FINALLY. I would highly recommend this for anyone who (like me) has tried a lot of more conventional workouts and wasn't getting results."
4,"Get the Vibe, man","To say the words 'Roy Ayers' invokes the very elements of the late 70s Jazz-funk scene; when his music was heard in discos across the UK, the funkateers danced to them with a loyal respect. They were cool then, they still are. Not all of the tracks are floorfillers of course, this is a compilation of sounds of a musician's musician. There are tracks here I have only heard before as a sample on some unremembered dance mix. The originals are here, unmolested and much the better for it. This is what made me like this album. Not only are there tunes that bring a faraway and wistful look to my face, there are tunes that are completely new to me. Fifteen tracks are not enough but expanding to a 2-CD set you'll still not have it all. Don't stop the feeling."
5,Excellent Film!!!,"This is a true story about a relatively unknown event during World War I.The film was done in the same style as Saving Private Ryan. When action was happening, the cameras were right there. Plenty of detail added to the authenticity. It is especially interesting for anyone that is familiar to the ways in which warfare was fought toward the end of WWI.Bayonets! Man, I'd hate to have been a soldier at this time.... Some of the scenes are not for the squeamish. The film holds nothing back...I have seen the film twice in the last three nights. I am still picking up information. In my opinion, the cast did an excellent job of bringing this film to life. Even from the German point of view, this must be a good film. The details in the trenches as well as the ""no man's land""... The weapons used... It all makes for a good film.It is a definite must for any collector of war films."
4,A rare film on America's contribution to WWI,"The Lost Battalion takes the viewer back to the trenches and battlefield of WWI, and focuses on the American contribution. Given the number of WWII movies with an American theme, I found it pleasing to watch one with a WWI perspective as there aren't as many. It was valuable to see some of the methods that were used in war from that period; such as using carrier pigeons to relay messages to Head Quarters. The narrative is mainly focused on an American Infantry Battalion that maintains its line, despite other allies falling back from positions on their flanks, and fighting gallantly to subdue a well equipped enemy. For the most part of their contact with the German's their exact position is unknown by command, which means that they must fight with increasing casualties and depleting resources.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
3,Disappointing,"With the exception of the half-decent match choice, this DVD was a disappointment. I saw this DVD and I was excited to get it and couldn't wait to watch it, but it wasn't anywhere close to what I expected.The Edge DVD misses out on some of Edge's better matches. It only included one singles match against John Cena, which happens to be on of my all time favorite rivalries. It included barely any great matches with Christian and it was disappointing. Also, only a couple of the matches included introduction videos, show you how the match came to be. That was ridiculous! I was expecting to see a lead up to each match, just like most of the other DVD's I have. Seeing the lead up to the John Cena Summerslam match they had on it would have atleast made a little bit of a difference.Overall, it didn't live up to what I expected it to be. Only a real Edge fan would like this DVD and it would still only worth the fact of owning it. It was very disappointing."
1,This is a bad book.,This is a bad book. You won't like it. Just believe me. Don't buy it. If you buy this book I will have to beat you up and tell your mommy on you for being bad.I hope this review was helpful in making you understand that this book is a bad book. Have a nice day.
5,White Bird,I will always remember... The ending. This book was... exciting!I think others should read this book because I think others will relate to it.
1,highland carrier bars.,These bars suck so bad that im about to throw them in a metal crusher. they dont work the way the instructions show i wish that i could return them for a full refund.
2,Spend your money somewhere else,"I bought this knowing I should have just spend the money for a Yakima system and was burned. The quality is trash, cheap, flimsy and just a lesson that you get what you pay for. Do yourself a favor and buy a quality roof rack. You have been warned."
4,"Inspires the Rainmakers, Nebraska Guitar Militia, etc.","Mellencamp paved the way for heartland rock, opening the path for bands like the Rainmakers, the Nebraska Guitar Militia, the Starkweathers, etc. Some of it sounds a little hokey today, but most of it holds up awfully well."
3,John Mellencamp - Just The Hits Folks,"This album is exactly what the title implies, a collection of Mellencamp's singles recorded during his first decade. For what it is the album is a decent enough collection. You get no album cuts here, just the big hits and as the title implies there is nothing from any of his albums after 1988. So, there is a lot missing here. If you are just looking for the hits this is ok, but Mellencamp's work goes much deeper than this."
5,I had forgotten how much I enjoyed his music...,"until I heard a couple of his '80s hits on my daughter's ipod. So I bought this and wasn't disappointed. All great songs, all great to sing along to. I personally think his '80s stuff was way better than Springsteen's '80s output. Not as bombastic or nostalgic."
5,Phenomenal album,"This album has all the hits of John Mellancamp, I could want. However, from other reviews on this album, this may be because I like his earlier (pre-1988) work the most. I use this album as an exercise album. They are all of his classic and have the John Mellancamp energy his old albums are known for. If you like his older music, this is the album for you."
3,Skin Deep,"I received the book in less time than expected,great job. The book is informative but tooooo wordy. It's definitely not a quick read!"
1,Save your money,"This book was of absolutely no help to me with my 80% build.Maybe at one time it was of some relevance, but every 80% lower that I have come across,is in a state that is completely inconsistent with the examples used in this book. Many of the steps in this book are no longer necessary on today's 80%s and what you DO need to finish is not covered. Any information that would have bene helpful, such as any sort of detailed drawings with dimensions, is absent. It not only was useless for finishing the lower, it gave no info on assembling the lower once you have it in a stripped state. It really is completely useless .... I didn't even want to give it one star.Don't waste your money"
4,Good-to-know information.,"Flying Spaghetti Monster forbid we ever get hit with another ""Assault"" Rifle Ban, but just in case...I've always believed that if you want to understand how something works, either build one yourself or watch one being built. This book provides that experience. Photos are clear, text is understandable and I now have a pretty good understanding on how the bottom side of the AR-15 functions. And you don't need a milling machine or a Unimat to build your own lower, either.I think I'll try building my own AR-15 before I tackle any other DIY gunsmithing books I have, especially if I can borrow/rent a jig. It doesn't look all that complicated."
1,It's easy to see why this didn't sell out in the stores where you can page through it,I have assembled several AR's of hi-quality and thought I might learn some ways to improve my skills. Obviously this jerks only requirement of his AR-15 was that he didn't have to register it. Sick! I want my money back.
4,Charming and conflicted,I loved this film. Just saw it for the second time on Netflix. I highly recommend it.
4,"Beautiful, goes together quickly","This was our house Christmas present. It's VERY attractive, and took 20 minutes to open, read directions and assemble. The different sizes let you pick exactly what fits in your space, and we chose the arch to complement the curves of the logs of the adjacent wall, and because we are older and if you stagger dumping wood into it you can grab it. It came with the necessary Allen wrench and an extra screw. 4 stars rather than 5- the screw assembly is flimsier than anticipated, with no real rigidity in something made of thick hammered steel (only one screw per leg or arm). We anticipate augmenting the fastenings and perhaps adding a brace. That will void the warranty:) but then it won't be necessary, because about the only thing that could fail are those short single button screws. I'd still recommend this highly for the design, and the astonishing amount of wood it holds, and the beautiful material nicely finished. It is made in the USA, too, in Washington State."
4,A major step toward integration of the psychotherapies,"In this, their 4th edition, Prochaska and Norcross have begun to achieve their goal--to make the cross-theoretical themes stronger than the language-bound and often confusing differences among psychotherapy theorists. As they clearly demonstrate, the similar themes among theories of talk therapy are strong and the differences among the leading theories are often subtle.My graduate students, though, seem to still need some help at times sorting out the authors' voices from those of the original theorists. I hope to see future editions in which the readers' confusions are anticipated better and there is a better ""safety net"" to hang onto when the illusion of theoretical certainty is withdrawn."
4,great to keep an wide perspective on therapies,"I have been working in health behavior for about 15 years by now. I have read hundreds if not thousands of articles regarding how to change behaviors.This book is far from perfect,but: I have found no better text to understand across the theories and experiences I have studied throught the years. I mean, the book itself contains a lot of knowledge. But the book set me in the right path to understand further.I thought I understood the transtheoretical model from other text books and dozens of articles I read before, I was wrong. Very few texts and authors go deep enough to understand the model.The beauty is that this book is an attempt to integrate several theoretical frameworks. So you are still free to hold your own paradigm. The ugly part is that it is not the best didactic approach.Silly people thought that this was a textbook. It is more like food for thought, a book made to trigger reflections on your own paradigm of psychotherapy."
2,Broad Coverage--BUT TERRIBLE WRITTING,"As a supplemental reader for my graduate course work, this book provided a broad coverage of theorists and their systems. The writing, however, was simply atrocious. Facts are thrown together as random sentences--leaving the reader with a frustratingly incoherent narrative. Overall, the authors present an incredibly pedantic writing style. At times I found myself laughing that anyone could write in such a nonsensical way! Here's an sample of what the reader is in for...""The hyperinflation of brand-name therpaies has produced narcissistic fatigue...This might be called the Exaustion Theory of Integration: the cynical but accurate observation that peace among warring schools is the last resort."" In my oppinion--it's better to invest in primary resources than to subject students to this book!"
3,psyche,Use what your teachers tell you but don't believe when they say it has to be a new edition. it's lies. All lies!
2,Nothing without Creedence,"Disappointing. Dylan's ""Man In Me"" carries the soundtrack. Don't know why this soundtrack didn't have ""Run Through the Jungle"" and ""Lookin' Out My Back Door,"" the two Creedence Clearwater Revival songs you hear playing during The Dude's escapades in his car. This leaves you with Kazaa, or buying Creedence's ""Chronicle."" I had the CCL album anyways, which, on its own, has 20 awesome songs at an incredible value."
3,Where's the Creedence?,"Overall the soundtrack is pretty good, but it is missing a few key tracks. Hello? I would have liked to have Tumbling Tumbleweeds and Looking out my back door, but most of the good songs are still included."
3,Unofficial Official soundtrack,"Love this album although it falls short on some of the movies best songs. There's not even any Credence!! The good news is that you can purchase basically all of the other songs as mp3's on Amazon and other sites, and then construct the actual official soundtrack."
5,This is one of the best soundtracks i've ever heard,I've seen this movie in germany where I use to live. This movie is real good!!! And the soundtrack either!!!
4,what the f*ck?!,"No Tumblin' Tumbleweeds. That's a bummer, man, uh, you've got to have Tumbleweeds in there, the film f*cking OPENS with it, man, and it's in there again later with the Stranger. This is a f*ckin travesty. F*ck it. I'm goin bowling."
2,Meh,Interesting topic idea. Poor writing. I had to start skimming after trudging through one third of it. Rather poor assumptions such as experiences while cryogenically preserved. Poor conclusion including claim of selfishness by the protagonist.
3,"Good, but small","Just an FYI, this suite will not fit any one over 5'11. My husband is 5'10 185lbs and its tight on him. This is definetly a good fit for a women. For the price, its a great costume."
3,"Oh god, say it aint so!","This is one of the worst episodes ever! Not as bad as the Great Vegitable Rebelion or the Promised Planet, but preaty damn bad!"
1,More Anti-Israel diatribe!,Another propaganda bandwagon: lets blame the Jews!Dont buy this rubbish along with every other book written buy decieved Jew hating morons.May Christ have mercy on these cretins.
4,Very Good Read,This was a very good book. Every page I read I couldn't wait to get to the next one. A very good gift for the Tom Clancy Op-Center lover in your family.
2,Huh?,"I could be alone in this. I too bought this book prior to an airline flight, and I based my purchase on two things. One, I thought Tom Clancy had something to do with it. And two, the blurb on the back seemed interesting.Well, I was mislead on both counts. I cannot for the life of me spot any influence from Tom Clancy - there is truly something wrong in the literary world when the cover of the book has the author in the smallest letters at the bottom.And where on earth was this supposed cleric stirring up rebellion against India? And when did the border ""erupt"" between India and Pakistan? Did I miss something? I'll admit I'm not the most observant reader in the world, but I'm sure I'd notice what the blurb claimed to be the major plots of the book.In the end, an okay book. Considering it wasn't by Tom Clancy. I certainly would not recommend it though, and I'd be making sure I am equipped with decent reading material before I take my next flight."
1,Worst book ever!!,I only borrowed this book because it said Tom Clancy on it and I was shocked to see that he had actually not written this book.This is the most inaccurate Tom Clancy book I have ever read:- Srinagar is not 25 miles away from the Line of Control- India has a 'no first use' policy meaning that it will not be the first one to use nuclear weapons (this means the 'SFF' had no excuse to blow up anything)- There is nothing like the 'naga naga' snake in India- Cell phones do not work in Kargil or any city in Kashmir except Srinagar
3,"It's Good, but.........","This is the 1st book of the op-centre series that I have read, and I was a bit surprised to learn that it was not written by Tom Clancy but by Jeff Rovin. However, the book has got elements of Tom Clancy like the realistic scenarios, unbelievable action and of course- Thrill. But this can't cover up some disappointments , the worst of which was the plot which did not have the in-depth coverage as other Clancy works. Sorry to say so, but its true. However, this is a fine book, just that it pales in comparison to Clancy's previous great works."
5,The bomb!,I have to say that me and my husband absolutely love this greatest hits CD. We listen to it all the time. Being oldie fans we think this is one of the best greatest hits CDs out there...you won't make a mistake buying this one!
2,HITS MISSING,"Where's ""Slow Wine?"" Where's ""Me and You?"" where's ""Born Not To Know?"" Anyone who claims this CD contains ""all"" of their hits is obviously not really familiar with all of their hits and doesn't know what they're talking about."
2,Absolutely not for beginners,"I have some programming experience in RealBasic and 4D's scripting language and decided to dive head first into AppleScript. The editorial review on this book says: ""The book assumes no prior knowledge or previous programming experience, but nevertheless seeks to offer a complete treatment of the language's capabilities."" After I quit reading the book when I got to chapter 11, I can safely say that I absolutely disagree with that statement.I found most of the examples to be very confusing and the numerous references to explain certain exceptions and reasons in later chapters to be very frustrating. Perhaps the nature of AppleScript is just confusing so I do not want to fault the author. If you are looking to learn AppleScript as a total beginner, like me, this is not the book for you."
2,Written more as a narrative than a technical book,"First, I will state that I am a hands-on software development professional with thirty years' experience. So I have a little background on which to base my opinion. The style of this book makes it nearly impossible to produce answers to the practical questions that I have. The text dances all around any definitive answers, forcing the reader to intently analyze the information provided so that a practical solution can be formed. Clearly, the editor did not stop the author from continuing down the path of writing a book for those who are already quite familiar with applescript. If you are already an applescript programmer, this book might be of use. If you are attempting to learn by example and concept as I am, look elsewhere for explicit information. I will say that this book is an anomaly so far as O'Reilly books go as I generally find them to be quite excellent."
2,Good for ADVANCED Applescript -- NOT beginners,"The problem with this book is that it seems to be the ""default"" book for the subject...which it should not be. It contains an in-depth and exhaustive look at all the nooks and crannies of the AppleScript language itself; but almost nothing about how it is actually applied (i.e., how to control other applications).If you are looking for a ""how do I use AppleScript to do stuff on my Mac"" book, look elsewhere. If you are a programmer and looking for advanced details on AppleScript, this may be the book for you."
2,Bad Idea...,"Once again, if you do not have at least 5 years experience as an executive recruiter do not even think about it. If you are totally new to the industry I suggest going with a franchise.MRISearchpathFPC"
5,Very Underrated!,"This Album is completely underrated, it may be a little commercial but the songs are tremendous. The cd seems to have energy and passion, it even sounds angry at times. Songs like Facing the animal, Another time, and End of my rope are awsome. The only negative thing i can say is that its not holding up as well as other malmsteen releases, thats probably because ive listened to it a couple thousand times.my ratings are,Braveheart-7/10Facing the animal-10/10Enemy-8/10Sacrifice-9/10Like an angel-7/10My Resurrection-10/10Another time-10/10Heathens from the north-7/10Alone in paradise-6/10End of my rope-10/10Only the strong-8/10Poison in your veins-6/10Air on a theme-7/10"
4,First Baby Workout,I am pregnant with my first child and I thought this would be a great way to stay active since I knew my days at the gym were numbered. I found this video to be extremely relaxing and enjoyed taking the time to do the short 15 minute or 30 minute segments during the week. I would recommend this for anyone who is pregnant.
2,Expected more,"I was excited to try this workout based on other reviews, but I was a bit disappointed. I was expecting more of an overall workout, but I felt shortchanged once I was done. I'm a moderately fit person and have continued to exercise throughout my pregnancy. I definitely felt it in my hips after I completed it, but I wanted more."
1,Painful side series,"Like some of the other reviewers, I found this workout to be lacking in a sufficient warm-up. I am very athletic (long distance runner, advanced pilates, and yoga) yet was in so much pain during the side series that I could barely finish. I didn't feel like the exercises targeted the muscles, but I certainly could feel it in my hip joints. I thought it was just me until I read some of the other reviews. I won't be using this DVD for my next pregnancy."
4,Weak Title...Strong Book,"I almost passed on this book because the title gave me the impression that it was probably a piece of fluff. In reality this is a very comprehensive study on all aspects of sleep. I really liked how the author put many things I already knew, more or less, into perspective. Such as: Driving while having slept too little is like driving after having drunk too much. Alcohol gets all the blame, while people pride themselves on going without sleep. One problem: I often have dreams that foretell some incident that occurs later in the day, and found this true for many others also. Psychic dreams seem to be as common as rain, but the author dismisses them as mere coincidence. I subtracted one star for this factual error."
4,Good but Not Great Heatwave Collection,"The Best Of Heatwave is almost the perfect compilation for the underrated band, who had hits from 1976 - 1982. Many of Heatwave's classic songs are included here, along with charting information, lineup information, and photos. You also get rare Extended Mixes for 'The Groove Line' & 'Eyeballin'. which were major disco hits to go along with the timeless slow jam, 'Always & Forever'. I won't list all of the tracks, but if someone wanted a single Heatwave CD, this would be IT. Serious fans would want additional tracks (and there's space available on the CD to add them!) like 'Sho Nuff Must Be Love', 'Super Soul Sister', 'Lay It On Me', and 'Posin Till Closin'. I added the extra tracks on my special customized disc, but that's just me...I want perfect compilations in my library! All n all, I'll rate this CD 8 stars out of 10! Not bad, but not great either!Pros - Remastering, 2 Rare Extended Mixes, LinernotesCons - Not All Inclusive, missing a few tracks"
1,What You See Is Not What You Get.,"This book probably deserves a rating of 5, and if I was interested in turning bowls that is what I might give it. But I'm not interested in turning bowls. I purchased the book to learn something about turning green spindles. And in that regard the book deserves a 0. There is nothing to enlighten the spindle turner. Nothing! Zero!One would think that a book titled ""Turning Green Wood"" would cover all aspects of the subject. Or, when that is not the case, at least include a subtitle to let the potential buyer know that the book is limited in its content. In this regard, it does not, and that accounts for my low rating."
1,Will not work on Windows XP Service Pack 1 or higher,"The sounds only works in the intro, and then cuts off.If you go to the manufacturer site and search for it under tech support, they will even tell you its a WinXP SP1 issue, and there is no fix.Not a very fun game without sound.Since we opened it - no returns for us."
4,Mistaken identity.,"The book starts off as Frank Morgan getting jailed because of a look alike that is an outlaw. He breaks out of jail and starts looking for the lookalike outlaw. He rides into the town of Chance to resupply and to verify his identity. He is told the lookalike has been raiding towns in the area and takes the job of deputy of Chance. He gets into a confrontation with a rancher from the area and settles it in his way. The outlaw raids the town and kidnaps some women, one of which Frank is fond of. Then ""The Last Gunfighter"" goes to rescue the women then to settle the score with the lookalike and his followers."
3,Objective Religious View Proves Interesting and Informative,"While not one of the most entertaining books I have ever read, BARABBAS provides a look at Christianity in a different era. The contradiction between the Christians' contempt for ""Barabbas the Acquitted"" and ""Christianity: Synonymous for 'Love'"" prove interesting. The style may be slightly rudimentary, but Agnostics, Baptists, and Atheists alike will get something out of this."
4,Great,"Just as described. I had this book many years ago, but wanted it again to refresh my memory on what to eat."
5,Get the SACD Version,"I have little more to say beyond the comments in the other featured review. This is a MAGNIFICENT performance, and should be in everyone's library.BUT it is important to add that the full glory of this ""apotheosis of Russian romanticism"" really becomes apparent ONLY in the SACD version of this disc.BUY the SACD. It's worth it."
4,An Excellent Book,"For those who wish for an academic and thorough reference of knighthood and chivalry, this is the book.I enjoyed every aspect of this work and it is well-worth the price. Buy it now!"
1,Colors Wrong,"The picture looks correct, but the colors on the flag I received were reversed: green on top and bottom, red on right, and left and green stars with red outline. This is unusable, and I have a special guest coming from Burundi next week."
1,no purchase,I I WILL NOT PURCHASE DUE TO THE REVIEWS. WHEN WILL THE BLU-RAY BE REALESED? HOPE NOT BY THIS COMPANY.
2,"Too small for a MacBook Pro, falls off the shoulder","It's a well constructed bag, but it's just to small (at least for a MacBook Pro). With the computer in, I have to stretch the pockets to fit in essentials like the power supply and even cables. I'd also like to keep my glasses case in there but that's too much.Also, the shoulder strap isn't balanced well. It crosses over the zip, so it keeps falling off my shoulder. Incredibly frustrating when, for example, in a hurry to catch a train."
1,"This is a terrible product, and the company's customer service is even worse","The product is not as advertised!It does not contain anything resembling cloth or other soft interior parts.The item does not have zippers and pockets as advertised.When returning the item, the company guaranteed a 5 -7 business day turnaround, but it took 10 business days, just to get the code to mail the piece back. I still do not have my refund.I am thinking of challenging with the credit card company.AVOID THIS COMPANY and THIS PRODUCT!!!"
1,Let's See......,"maybe they call this ""PUNK"" Rock because a bunch of ""PUNK'S"" listen to it. After a formal review, I am very aware of both ""Fuel"" bands & must say, this particular ""Fuel"" SUCKS.. PUNKS!I find it humorous that anyone could compare the two, since this ""Fuel"" is so audioable you can scream along! And for those to even bash the REAL ""FUEL"", well all I have to say is...you must have a ""Sunburn"" in your Prince Albert, that's what all the screaming's about!"
3,not the band from PA,"ok this is not the band from PA neither is it their underground stuff. believe me, their underground stuff is ""Porcelain"", ""Hazleton"", ""Fuel""(tape) and ""Small the Joy"". they were not a punk band. and also Fuel is one of the best bands out there. they make music that sounds like REAL rock music. their cd's are awesome and they are great live so to say they (stink) is just being naive. just wanted to clarify."
2,"Cat Came Back, the only good cartoon","I have seen the DVD cover cartoon ""Cat Came Back"" years ago at an Animation festival. Has aged well and still refreshing and hilarious to watch. A lot of subtile sight gags really makes this a classic. Leonard Maltin introduces each cartoon which can be bypassed with the chapter next button. Unfortunately there are no other entertaining cartoons, only unfunny bad art. Get the ""Cat Came Back"" on any other compilation, the one great cartoon in this entire disc."
2,One hit wonders,"In a move which is typical of many '60s and 70's artists, The Three Degrees had only one hit- When Will I See You Again? It really doesn't matter how talented we may think they are the album title is a bit deceptive. At least they don't call it a ""Greatest Hits"" collection!"
1,Shoddy microphone,"Comfortable to wear, but the microphone was absolute crap.It was composed of a hollow metal tip with a hollow plastic tube leading up to the earpiece. There were no electronic components leading down to the mouthpiece, and I fail to see why it was even there. The microphone receiver was located INSIDE the earpiece, and when it did manage to catch the odd sound, it put itself in an endless loop - any noise coming out of the earpieces was picked up by the microphone.Since I bought this FOR the microphone, it was entirely unusable. It's currently being sent back to Amazon for a refund. Mine might have been a fluke, but I won't be trying these headphones again. Instead, I got a Cyber Acoustics AC-645 stereo headset w/mic and have been very pleased with it these past few weeks."
1,INACCURATE DESCRIPTION**BE AWARE**,If you are thinking of purchasing this item be aware that this item is not **POLISHED BRASS** 98% is green distressed. The title is misleading and I returned mine to Amazon. Just be aware. OK?
5,GREAT SHOW!,"I saw this show back in 1996 with the original cast in one of London's West End theatres....It was amazing and has stayed as my favorite stage perforamce up to date...I have seen other shows since but none have topped By Jeeves...its a wonderful, funny play with AMAZING music! Buy the music!"
4,not very durable,this set is lots of fun! the only thing i don't like about it is that the back of the middle shelves falls out constantly! otherwise it is a wonderful set that i have had hours of fun with.
3,Perfectly fine for the price,"I'm a picky devil and the little things about this faucet are worth noting.1. The installation is very easy and includes a tool to make it even easier. This is important to some of us.2. Every time the faucet turns off, the stream defaults back to aerated rather than spray. Consistency helps.3. Yup, it's plastic. Hasn't seemed to matter yet, but if it does, I'll amend this review.I think it's worth the cash"
1,Cheap plastic,"This faucet looks great in the picture and at ""only"" $120.00, it seemed like a good value. Guess what...the handle and the body are cheap plastic. Do you want a cheap P-L-A-S-T-I-C faucet in your kitchen???? I sure don't. I don't care how it works...it's cheap, cheap, cheap and Moen should be ashamed to sell this garbage.Did I say it is cheap? Only reason I gave it 1 star is you can't give it NO STARS!!!"
2,Didn't last very long.,"I realize that nothing lasts forever, but for around $120, it should last a lot longer than a year an a half. I went with this brand because I remember the ""buy it for looks, buy it for life"" commercials. What a joke.It was great while it lasted though, and I love the way it looks."
3,Enjoyable,"This book, while not FANTASTIC, was for lack of a better word, ""enjoyable."" I thought the characters were very true to life. However, I can see how others might not want to look so deep to appreciate this book."
3,"Not The Best Read Of My Life; And No Doubt Yours, Too","If you're like me and you're a little tired of reading glowing reviews of every mediocre book out there, I offer you an honest opinion from an avid book reader. The Calligrapher is classic first-time-novelist fare, with all the puffed-up language (especially at the beginning) that new novelists like to impress on their audiences, coupled with in-depth knowledge of an original and creative subject (in this instance, the art of calligraphy). There's no doubt Docx has creative vision and real skill as a author, but that doesn't mean much when I'm curling up in bed and all I want is a book I look forward to opening and can't stop reading - which this isn't. If you've bought it or have been given it as a gift, it's worth getting through, but in that I-need-something-to-get-me-through-this-airplane-ride kind of way."
1,What Are We Doing Here?,"Time was... you would watch a movie and love the sound track and rush down to the CD racks and buy it. I guess that convention doesn't apply to the ""Wag The Dog"" soundtrack. What happened to Edgar Winter's ""Good Old Shoe"" performed by Pop Staples and Willie Nelson? Being a Blues enthusiast, I couldn't wait to add this to my iPod. Merle Haggard's ""Courage Mom"" is also missing. What I'd like to know is where are these treasures locked up? The credits at the end of the movie list all of the songs with full credit to the writers and performers and then says something like Sound track available on CD. We've been robbed! I love Mark Knopfler's music, but this was not a solo effort. What are we doing here?"
1,...,"These songs in ""Wag The Dog"" were excellent. ""Old Brown Shoe"", that patriotic song and that tribute to the brave men of the ""303"" unit. Are any of these on this soundtrack? NO! And that is criminal at best! Unless you are really into Mark Knopler, stay away from this."
4,A well balanced text,"I have used this text consistently for the past 4 years. Whitney does a good job at situating rather technical information in the context of general themes. Whitney tends to focus on psycholinguistics proper and presents little on how language is used (see Timothy Jay's Psychology of Language text in contrast). Unfortunately the text is getting somewhat out of date, as it has not been revised since the initial 1998 edition (whereas most texts in the field see a 3 to 4 year revision cycle). Still one of the best advanced undergraduate psycholinguistics text out there (see also David Carroll Psychology of Language)."
5,Great box set!,"I don't go anywhere without taking this with me. I like all the alternate versions of their old stand-by songs, like I Want You to Want Me. If there were anything I would change, it would be to add Don't Be Cruel and the alternate version of Surrender. The book that comes along with it is a great bonus in my opinion."
5,smells awesome,"i love this stuff, it smells awesome and i was really happy to find it at this price!!! will buy again"
4,Purchased this for the GF,"She liked it, and I did too. This fragrance is young and playful, yet mature. Never mind it looks as though the sparking liquer brand, Nuvo designed their bottle after Very Irresistible."
2,just ok,I am a zombieophile so I try to see and read all things zombie. This film was just ok. I laughed once or twice. Not a fan of the new fangled zombies that talk and think but the story had some cute moments. Wouldn't bother with this film unless you REALLY like the zombie genre.
5,Great little Randy Scott western,"I collect westerns. And when I saw a Randolph Scott available, I bought it, despite never having seen it before. Was very pleasantly surprised, which hasn't always been the case with these kinds of purchases. Great little story, good cast, characters well drawn, plenty of action and Gabby Hayes as well. Transfer is good with only two minor blips that didn't detract from the watching. Good enough to tell when they were using a painted background(not often), rather than the real thing. Color was great. And learned what an early teamster had to do."
5,Randolph Scott - high quality western,Albuquerque is an excellent western that movies energetically through the plot. No real surprises in the story. Technical quality of the DVD was excellent.
4,Pleasing,I like this book. It's as good as a $100 sketch book. If your just starting out this is a good selection.
3,Okay.,"This book did help me with my drawings. I needed to know proper proportions and how to draw fabric, etc., but I agree with everyone else: the figures are very ""superwoman""ish and, in my opinion, showing way too much skin! I had to put a paper cover over the book so my children wouldn't see the back cover! I was disappointed to find out that the typical design drawing has it's proportions exagerated to make the figure look very tall and thin, but I guess I should have seen that coming with the way today's fashions are. Fortunately the book also provided a scale for real-life proportions."
3,Requires Previous Art/Sketching Knowledge,"This book is too comprehensive for a student who has elementary drawing skills. It assumes that the reader knows how to sketch a proportionate body shape along with various positions.Recommend learning structural composition, line, contour and tone, and gestural structure before tackling these concepts."
4,Buy this CD,"I really don't think you can really appreciate this CD until you have heard Roni Size live. However, let me say that this CD is excellent because it stays away from the typical jungle/breakbeats you here. I just saw him spin at the 9:30 club in D.C. and it was off the hook. Buy the CD. See him live."
3,"Sounds great, but not much there","I would have to say that Roni Size really has a great _sound_ going on in this release, the fusion of jazz and jungle beats work really well....however, the album is marred by some seriously uninteresting rhythmic programming; several tracks 'brown paper bag,' 'trust me' anda bunch of others suffer from extreme repetetiveness, unlike the constantly mutating breaks of goldie or photek. the whole album has an unfinished feel about it, some jusdicious editing and more complexity in the beats would help it considerably."
4,Not Enough Jazz?,"This is a great album ignoring the somewhat pompous title. Jazz, blues, funk, drum n bass etc are hardly new. I agree with others that it is a little too repetetive and boring at times but hey what isnt these days. Those seeking a bit more jazz and fewer and slower beats might like to check out Bugge Wesseltoft and his equally pompously titled New Conception of Jazz which has real horns, guitars, a wider spread of tempos and is actually rather better than this apart from some iffy treated vocals (but then if it has to be called Drum N Bass to fit your personal lifestyle choice, keep the blinkers on)"
3,Early Nora,"I agree with the previous reviewer, however, the two stories are from Nora's early works. I did enjoy Untamed more than Less of a Stranger mostly because of the circus background. Both stories concentrated on girls who were extremely naive and had no self confidence and both stories portrayed rich, arrogant men. Of course it was purely romance and romantic, silly games and in the end, everything works out. Untamed centers around Jo Wilder and Keane Prescott and the circus and Less of a Stranger does the same with Meg Miller and ""Katch"" and an amusement park - Joyland. Readers have to keep in mind that this is not the ""Nora"" romance and suspense of today's novels. It is very light, kind of corny romance, but can be enjoyable if you don't want to think too much. These stories are just okay."
4,zebre92,"An excellent selection of Lieder from Shubert, a great singer with a marvelous voice, and a good technical level given the period where the recordings were made."
5,Very helpful,"This book is very informative. If you have or are thinking of picking up a common kingsnake, pick up this book, it will give you a great foundation and really help you to get going"
4,Pretty Damned Good!,"While not possessing quite the borderline-religious-experience, funky-to-the-bone hysteria of the Nevilles' live shows (especially those old two-set Mardi Gras marathons at Tipitina's), this is probably the Brothers' best studio record since Yellow Moon. It has a nice balance, showcasing the diverse talents of all four Neville Brothers (Art, Charles, Aaron, and Cyril), and the sound is uncluttered and with emphasis on the vocals. The ballads (""Dimming of the Day"", ""Utterly Beloved"") are lovely, and the New Orleans-Caribbean version of ""If I Had a Hammer"" is a highlight, as is that Uptown New Orleans party entitled ""Real Funk."" Still, an added spice of Cyril's congas and percussion here and there, and perhaps an acapella-harmony ""Indian Red"" (as I have heard them do live) might have elevated the record to a masterpiece. As it stands, it's merely pretty damned good."
1,very slanted,This book is very slanted. After interviewing Ross Perot the author presents mainly the negatives and does not speak with any of the volunteers and voters who supported Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996.
5,Some of the best tracks I've ever heard,"being gen X i didnt think anything much of the b- g's. but i got the album for dad, and let me tell you what: IT ROCKED BETTER THAN ANY OF THE STUFF BEING RELEASED TODAY!!! My favs are surrender, obsessions and I will and i could not ove u more! THESE GUYS CAN OUT DO CELINE DION/BACKSTREET BOYS/ anyday!!!!Rock ON Dudes!"
1,"You get what you pay for - cheap, thin, uneven assembly line work NOT made in US!","December 19, 2012 - Searched all over for Canadian flag and I realized for price I'd probably get what we paid for it, which is true. While the package was neat and shipped from Japan, the flag was folded and contained in an inside plastic wrapper. Unfolding it was another matter-you could tell this is assembly line cutting and sewing-the standard flag pole would only fit one end as the other end was sewn shut and crooked stitching! That top overlay part is read and you can visibly see where the worker cut off the end before proceeding to the next flag - very crooked side, stitching loose and threads hanging. While it was only $4 and free shipping, I would not recommend this flag if you are wanting it for something very special; otherwise, for a lawn flag, it is fine. This is NOT made in the us and ships from Japan."
5,So fun,"Love this ring, have it on today, I love the spinning mechanism, it looks exactly as represented"
5,very good quality and value production,"You can't beat this book on Giger's art as a general showcase of all of his achievements over the years. It's also great value for money at what is really chump change for everything you get.It's allure is it's broad spectrum covering his phases of art production, but at the same time this also becomes this book's only weakness. Because it covers everything in passing, it also lacks in-depth coverage of the aspects of his art. It's good starting point for anyone that would like to get to know his art in detail, and from this book you move on to more specific books that showcase certain areas."
4,Mesmerizing picture,The cover caught my attention. Always been impressed by this picture. The size of the book was small. I had not paid attention to that when I made the purchase.
5,A wonderful piece of American history!,"I couldn't put this series down. The stories are wonderful bits of American history. Great pictures, beautiful art work. This is perfect for anyone interested in the sideshow, the circus, fairs, magic, tattoos, theater, art, performers, oddities, etc. etc. When I was little we used to go to the sideshow and these books are a wonderful reminder of those times. The sideshow is a very important part of American history and the Shocked & Amazed series is helping to keep alive the art and performances of this very unique group of people. Hurray!!! It looks at the past, present and future. The stories, by a wide range of authors, are very well written & interesting to read. The old photos are a blast. The words of many of the performers are inspirational. Thanks to creator James Taylor and all involved. Keep up the good work."
1,Doesn't work,"Even with an electric air pump, the tubes on this never would inflate enough to make an actual round tube - they just collapse and lie flat in the pool! And when anyone gets in a tube, it immediately pulls out of the cube that is meant to hold it all together. They aren't attached at all. Lousy design and WAY overpriced."
1,"support, what support? this product is borken right out of box","this product does not save into AUTOCAD DWG, DXF files.there is a bug.Imsi do not have a fix for this bug, making this product useless.Imsi website is a mess with lots of broken links. The buildin web links have broken links.. even the one that suppose to update links to the correct links. Imagine how much support you get from these jokers."
2,WWE Mr. Perfect,"As a fan of AWA, WCW and WWE this was a snoozer as most WWE productions now are. No commentary from Ric Flair just mostly Larry ""The AX"" Hennig going on and on about how great his son was....ugh!"
3,"pretty good, but not Perfect....","Recently I purchased this DVD set. It's a 2 disc set. It has many interviews/skits w/ Mr.Perfect and it has matches too. It's cool having all the material it has in this set. However I felt it could of came with more matches. 1 on 1,tag,ect... It just kinda lacks matches compared to other wrestling sets I've bought. Also, like nearly half the matches are against Bret ""Hit Man'' Heart. Which he's also a good wrestler, but it just feels like there are even less matches then. My 9yr old son & I enjoy watching the WWF era wrestling more than WWE wrestling. So I 've been trying to get many of the old school DVD's. Overall, if you like WWF era wrestling & wrestlers. Than I still recommend this DVD set. To buy it on Amazon for like $3.00 or less + shipping, it's worth it still. Worth adding to your collection. Just not perfect."
4,Very Good DVD,This is a very good DVD collection from one of pro wrestlings greatest stars that left us way early!
4,Almost Perfect...,"From seeing the DVD ste of the life and career of Curt Hennig, I have to say that while I thought the documentary and some of the extras(most notably the ""Rap Is Crap"" music video) was perfect, the match selection falls a little short.Except for some of the matches, I highly reccommend this DVD on one of the greatest wrestlers who have ever lived."
3,Amateurish production but a sweet story,"Leonette travels to England to investigate the sudden death of her father. The initial report says his death was by natural causes, but Leonette is unconvinced. With the help of a handsome lawyer, she digs deeper. Will she like what she finds out? This film has a ""Dark Shadows"" production value but Leonette is very winning and so is the lawyer. The story has enough mystery to keep the interest of viewers. Recommended as a nice film to show on a quiet evening for most female audiences."
2,Heat Plus Gel Heating Pad,I found this heating pad to be very small. The gel does help to give a soothing heat. The quality is good. The control does get hot.
3,Lighten up! These girls (and guy) had potential,"This was not a great album by any means, but Mr. Whisper as a song rates in my Top 100 and most of their other songs had elements with a lot of potential. The intro hooks to many songs were superb, they just needed help in developing the rest. Those who were venomous in their one star ratings need to get a life. Mr. Whisper is a gem."
1,What are they talking about this book is terrible!,"I have work in the publishing industry for over thirty years. I am an avid non-fiction reader. I have written reviews of books mostly for trade journals. This book is so poorly written that it puzzles me why other reviewers would gush over it. It is difficult and tedious to read. It leaves no doubt that English is a second language for the author. It is studded with german political phrases and movements that are not explained and have no meaning to anyone without a previous grasp of the subject. This is not a book for the novice wanting to know more about the formation of modern Germany. I am so happy that I did not buy this book but instead borrowed it from the New York City Library where I will happily return it, and look for something that is better written!"
2,Sticking with traditional litter.,"This was one of my ""I want to be cool and environmental"" attempts.But it doesn't clump. It doesn't cover. It's hard to scoop. It doesn't conceal odors. It's a pain to clean. I don't know how anyone can use this on a regular basis. And it's so unnatural -- my cat used it, but I'm pretty sure she preferred regular soft litter to the pile of little cylindrical rods that were piled in her litterbox.Worst of all, it doesn't cover odors. At all. Or maybe it does, if your cat doesn't poop. You won't smell urine, until you actually get close to dump it out and the gloppy mess moves. Then it's rancid.On the upside, cats can't kick out piles of litter or track it around the house. And there's no dust (but there's also normal litter with minimal dust). I would never in my right mind buy this again. If you're looking for a natural litter, try Swheat Scoop (it's considerably better than this, but I'll still stick with normal clumping clay litter)."
4,An Excellent Sampling,"This collection is a must have for New Kid's fans everywhere, old and new. It spans the beginning of their career to the end. I especially enjoyed the inclusion of the song ""If You Go Away"" which demonstrates the maturation of their voices as well as song content. Unfortunately, as they experieneced the rise and fall in popularity and sales as most teeny bopper groups do, their music goes relatively unheard. I still love their sound. So what if only two or three of them could really sing....."
2,So-so,Product was easy to set up but the quality of transmission was not great. It appears dependent on the devices being on the same circuit which is not a high likelihood
1,Do I need to say more?,I had to call to find out that they didn't have the items I had pay for... Do I need to say more?
3,Could've been more added,"Once again, I have to complain about the way American record companies treat their material. Neither disc in this set runs full length with both clocking at less than 50 minutes. This could've either have been reduced down to one CD (as the RCA essential series) or expanded with lesser known (but still worthy) cuts such as ""Out of You"", ""There's No Food In This House"" & ""Watermelon Time In Georgia"". When Bear Family can come up with a 12 disc set that all CD's run full-length, it's pitiful that the best Sony can do for Lefty is a two CD set with neither CD running full length.What's here is presented in a clean, re-mastered version. It does serve as a decent sampler and/or intro to one of the greats of country music, but casual fans aren't going to want to pay the price for a two CD set to get introduced to his music and serious fans will have most of this already which essentially leaves ""Essential"" without an audience."
3,Wait until the new one,"This was good. Not as good as the first one, and much, much, worse the the 2nd (which was pretty brilliant imho). I believe there is another documentary coming out either early this year, or maybe it came out late last year. I believe it will focus more on the WM3 and their case for getting out of prison and a little less rehash. There are a few very disturbing photos of the dead children/crime scene that I'm not certain had a place in the movie---since they had already shown more than enough of those images in the first two movies and thankfully in less gory detail."
4,I heard,My friend was taking an African American history class and he spoke of this horrible occurance. I was glad to find the book and with such an economical price and in good condition.
1,Unsubstantiated,"The government completed its research of the subject matter, intiated at the request of Congressman Bernie Thompson, and the information printed in this book is false. The government came to its conclusion by tracking down pay documents, personnel records, and interviews with survivors. Good read, but not true."
4,When the phonograph was king ...,"A decent mix of fine instrumentals for just about any mood. I bought this for the Joe Harnell piece, but enjoy ""most"" of the rest of the music. There are better compliations, but this one might deserve a spot in your CD rack."
2,Nothing Great,"If you have read anything and I do mean anything on this topic, pass this book by. It's short on substance and quite folksy. I had hoped for more and I am just a layperson. Try searching reflective listening."
4,Great Hit By Greatest Artist,"I have been a fan of Joan Jett since 1976 and was thrilled when she finally broke through with ""I Love Rock N Roll"" in 1982, but there is much more to Joan than ""that song"" and this album features an excellent selection of tracks from her previous albums to prove it. I was disapointed in the remixes of ""Roadrunner"" and ""I Hate Myself For Loving You""; I prefer the original versions, but all 15 of these tracks RRRRock!"
4,I LOVE JOAN JETT!!,I really enjoyed this cd cllection of Joan Jetts hits. It is the only one I could find. I hope they will come out with a larger collection someday but this is good.
4,Beads Dreams!,"This is a very interesting book. Well designed, with a fine content, beautiful and detailed photographs and reasonable explanations on jewellery projects. It shows many types of beads and gives different examples of traditional necklaces from every continent. I highly recommend it."
5,QUEEN OF BLOOD~QUEEN OF B MOVIE SCI~FI,"Excellent Movie and a great companion to Planet Of The Vampires! Following that movie's plotline, a group of astronauts try to rescue a ship only to find the lone survivor is a female vampire! This is a deluxe remastered edition from the mid-1960's, and the quality is fantastic! Beautiful colors, atmosphere, and very chilling. Being trapped on the ship with nowhere to go adds an extra dose of fear. A Cult Classic of Horror/Sci~Fi!"
5,A Greatest Hits Masterpiece,"This is one of the best Greatest Hits C.D.s to ever be made If you like SoundGarden you will Love this..........I just love the album it has all the right songs for all the right moments Pretty noose, Burden in my hand, Black Hole Sun, Outshined those are just a few of the many hits on this c.d. trust me buy it and you will like it"
5,This made me a Soundgarden fan!,"This is easily the best CD I have ever heard- there is not one song I don't find interesting. And the best thing about it is that there is such a wide range of styles here- from slow, melodic, almost-pop (""Blackhole Sun""), to ruthless, heavy, hardcore, primal rock (""Spoonman"", ""Outshined""). It's got it all! I first got the CD a long time ago because I heard ""Blackhole Sun"" on the radio, and while that's a great song, there are so many others. ""Outshined"" and ""Loud Love"" have two of the best riffs of the decade, in my opinion, not to mention ""Spoonman"" and ""Blow Up the Outside""- the list goes on and on. If you like heavy, yet melodic and even beautiful REAL hard rock (not some of this generic rap-metal crap these cookie-cutter bands are putting out today), then do yourself a favor and get this CD. Get 2, one for home, one for away, or get 3, and share the wealth w/ your friends. They will like you 10 times more!"
3,The essential is there,"Soundgarden was a good band but they won't make history.If you like grunge rock, you'll like it.To me, few songs are unforgettable like ""Outshine"", ""Black old sun"" or ""Burden in my hand"" but it takes a lot more to remains in the major league of rock music."
2,packs all the fun of radio listening on to one CD,O.K. SG is one of my favorite all time bands but this sucks. Itbasically has all the songs that are probably my least favorite SGsongs on this CD.
4,Zeppelin Stole Stairway to Heaven!!!,"Flat out, the song 'Tarus' IS stairway to Heaven. Zepp opened for Spiit wayyyy back in the day and as they gained popularity and Spirit faded, they went ahead a ripped off was it arguabley their most popular song.Jimmy... Robert.... all of Led Zeppelin, you have lost MAJOR cool points with me and many others who are catching on to this robbery. Not cool Led, not cool."
3,"Skimpy, But It Works","Certainly not as thick as described, but the mechanics of it work, and I do use it. Kinda ridiculous to require extra words."
3,Heating Pad/Massage,"This heating pad is not as efficient as one I previously bought. It does not have straps, therefore it is more difficult to situate."
5,Best heating pad ever,This is the best heating pad ever for relief from back pain. It has two levels of heat and two levels of massage. The massage function is terrific.
2,Had to return it,I would like to have known before I purchased the pad that you could not lean or lie on it. It was of no use to me at all since I needed it for my lower back.
1,I wish I had Not gotten this heating pad,The pad is WAY too small and WAY to thick. The vibrate is way too LOUD and I hate the auto shut off in 1 hour. The low heat is too hot if you plan to lay on it and that is if you can lay on it ( so thick and small) like a hard back book. :(I should have not made an impulse buy and just have read more reviews here. This was a waste of money.
4,"Th Good, The Bad, and The Ugly...","The good:-Best screen ever. I watch movies on it.-Runs both my home recording studio, Photoshop CS, ITunes, and everything else I loaded it with(a buttload of artwork, music, movies, etc....).The Bad:-Battery life sucks(25 mins maybe 30. Nah, make that 20)-Power pin broke, but still works-Heavy. Very, especially if you're scrambling around in an airport with other carry on bags. Clumsy to use in the airport longue-it's big for a laptop.-Customer service stinks(what company doesn't?). Luckily I was able to figure out my own issues with this thing.The Ugly:-The letters wore off the keyboard within a month after using it! Trying to teach my boss how to use a computer and type on this is impossible."
5,A easy way to add more ports.,I needed more powered U.S.B. class 2 ports on my desktop computer and this hub with 4 powered U.S.B. ports on the front of the case did the trick.Low price and easy to install.
1,Where is the magazine?,"Nov 5th i ordered this, it is now april and i have not received a single copy. thanks to amazon.com's lovely ""user friendly"" web page im completely unable to contact the seller or anyone inside the united states.this is really sad because im sure this magazine is great id just like to know when its supposed to get here or how i can atleast get a refund. this is horrible customer service."
4,Pretty good book.,"The planes are nice, and instructions not too difficult for kids. Some planes fly better than others, but all are fun."
4,Excellent Book--A Bit Much for Kids,"This is a great book for kids and adults. There is lots of stuff for kids to do, but there is much that is really for adults. For adults, I would give the book 5 stars."
4,OK product.--great cust srvc from Rival,"The IS400 does a superb job of rendering a handful of ice cubes into enough shaved ice to fill a 12oz cup, which is exactly what this model is designed to do. However, I don't believe the IS400 is well designed to hold up over long periods of use. We make snow cones and iced drinks with it nightly. After hours of intermittant use during a party, a crack appeared in the blue bowl that holds the ice cubes which eventually radiated across the top, breaking it. We contacted Rival Customer Service (800-323-9519) to order a replacement part, and Rival instead sent, free of charge, a complete new unit. I genuinely appreciate Rival standing behind their product, but I'd prefer the IS400 be made a bit more sturdy. Expect the IS400 to do a great job making snow cones, but anticipate the probability that it'll break."
1,Waste of your money,The witcher is an amazing game and a great buy for your money. But not if you value your computer. The witcher uses Tages protection. Something compleatly incompatible with most systems today. It will make you crash and lag on off times. Even better yet. Good antivirus systems recommend you don't install this at all. They'll throw hissy fits. For good reason too. Just don't buy this game. It isn't worth it.
2,The Witcher,"I ordered this because of all the hype. Had I known I wouldn't be able to get it to run on my Windows 7 laptop, I wouldn't have bothered. After a long install and excitement to play, error after error. I googled up the wazoo looking for solutions and each one I did was for nothing. I followed directions for the driver error fix, yet no change. I uninstalled multiple times, re-installing and starting over with patches, fixes, etc. This game now sits collecting dust because it wasn't in the least bit compatible. I was very irritated that with each effort, the game wouldn't work."
2,combat kills this game,"I am interested in why most people are happy with this game. I can not stand the combat, it is for me a game killer. Combat is as follows: left click the mouse, wait 1.0 seconds, left click the mouse, wait 1.0 seconds left click the mouse, wait 1.0 seconds..left click the mouse, crap clicked too soon...left click mouse... oh lets cast a spell, right click the mouse..ect ect. It ruins whatever else maybe good about it. Its a RPG for Dummies, with half baked ""moral"" dilemas that everyone raves about, seen them, played them in much better packages, not exactly ground breaking. If you think Fable was a great game, this one will make you happy..If you prefer games like Planescape Torment, I would avoid it."
3,video games,"was not impressed by this game as so many others were. it is not a bad game, i just fell for the hype"
1,Don't Buy,"If you enjoy aggravation buy this game,enjoy crashing to the desktop ,buy this game. my computer is high-end enough that it runs on high settings but even if i tone it down ,it crashes. customer support? I can't even register the game, oh I registered on the forum OK but the game said i haven't done it yet.I wish i had checked the forum site 1st I would have seen all the grief people are having...don't buy this game."
3,Slow read,I don't know why everyone rates this book so high.All I read is true crime. I found this book very hard to follow and just plain confusing.I couldn't finish this book.I am interested in the characters in the book. I am going to try to find a book that is easier to follow on the Moor murder's.
2,Plastic body does not support large antenna,"As soon as I received this radio I tried it out by turning it on and pulling the built in antenna up. The base felt flimsy and after a few tries the antenna base broke inside the radio. I am looking to return this item as it is not designed right.I cannot comment on the reception as the antenna is broken!Overall, it's a nice looking unit but they cheaped out on the materials."
1,poor quality,"Don't be fooled by the Grundig name, which used to stand for quality. This radio feels cheap and would not, in my estimation, survive falling on the floor. I'll stick with my old Yacht Boy until I find an affordable, quality, portable (small) radio with digital tuning. Are quality consumer electronics totally a thing of the past?"
1,POS Radio,"I hate this radio.I bought it because I wanted a good am/fm radio when we camp in far reaches of the Mojave. Right now it's beeping incessantly every day at 11:23 am, even when it's unplugged and the batteries are dead, or so it says because you can't listen the radio without it being plugged in. It is difficult to use without the instructions which you must take with you everywhere if you want to do anything with beside listen to am/fm and presently I can't find them to shut off the damned alarm. And it eats batteries like they are free.I hate this radio so much that I'm going to sell or throw it away.Unless you are an electronic geek with no other life, do not buy this radio. I hate it."
5,tommy armours ABCs if golf,"The best golfing guide I have ever read. I have shared the book with several friends and all have enjoyed it and, according to them, have improved their game. I have purchased several more (used) and given as gifts. It is very hard to find a new copy."
3,Bosch RA1181 Benchtop,"The table was fairly easy to put together, except for the plate. I have tried and tried to level out the plate with no success. I would try some other brand if I were buying a router table."
5,Great combination with my Bosch router,"Read other reviews, here and elsewhere, of this router table, and all reviews were good (except for those who said it was difficult to assemble or some apparently early problems with inserts, I think). Anyway, I had no trouble with the assembly, although had to spend some time with the leveling of the middle plate to try to get it just right. The table is sturdy, allows for through the table adjustments, has the very useful feather boards (one more for the table might have been helpful), and has a good set up with switches and outlets. The table size is good. I've had no problems with it. I purchased a new Bosch router at about the same time, so I don't know how well it works with other brands. It did seem to have quite a few mounting holes, however, for other brands of routers."
5,"Wonderful Router Table, We love ours!",We examined many router tables prior to making our selection of the Bosch Router table. We have mounted a Milwaukee router to it and it is been a pure pleasure to use since then. We are wood carvers and this has been a wonderful addition to our tool set.We were lucky enough to get this on sale from Amazon with free shipping. We mostly use this router table for creating profiles on our wood carvings.
1,an other one that is warped,"Half of the reviews writen from March 2012 have had warped tops I wounder if the other half just did not catch it. This does not say much for Bosch QA not to catch a bad casting.Update Just recieved a second one and it has the same problem. The second one had been opened before,it sounds like Amazon just recycles the bad ones instead return them to Bosch. I talked to a tech at Bosch and he said that they were not aware any problems with RA1181 and to bring it in to a repair center."
1,Rustbucket,I had the same problem as above. The cart started rusting immediately. It was completely rusted out in a year.
3,Not bad,I do like a lot of the Ernest movies and Goes to Africa is pretty good. The Greatest hits I can do without.
5,Fingersmith customer,My shipment was sent as amazon and the customer promised it arrived the date it should of and it was packaged beautifully I am very satisfied with my purchase and I'm sure anyone else who purchases this product will be too!
4,Whether or not you believe the events in this book happened:,"The teachings and concepts are quite compelling and thought provoking. I listened to the cassette version, and it was very inspiring. A wonderful celebration of peace, and a challenge that when each of us to live peace each day we expotentially create peace worldwide."
5,Great Songs of Rainbow,I always liked the music of Rainbow?. quick shipping from Amazon. Takes me back to those fun times of the musicians in it? just fun?
4,Audie Murphy,"I think our most decorated war hero was type cast in action films,namely low budget westerns. He may have been a better actor than that, if given the chance."
1,never recieved,"never recieved movie ,glitch in your system ,wasnt in stock,waited thirty days to fing that out,so?"
4,The presence of Penn,"It seems like a lot of the other reviewers were nitpicking, so I'm going to throw my two cents in. If you want to gain some insight into Sean Penn as an actor, and see how early his best qualities manifested themselves, then this is a great place to do it. The teenage Penn has amazing confidence and poise. His eruptions of violence are as ""attractive"" as they get. His adolescent menace is palpable, yet he also displays an amazing emotional range in this movie. Although I never spent any time in the juvenile pokey, the movie's setting is consistent with what I would imagine.The feel of this movie ranks with such gems as ""Over the Edge"" and ""My Bodyguard"" (two early Matt Dillon vehicles). It's too bad that Dillon's command failed to mature as much as Penn's."
5,The Witch Tree Symbol,I buy these Nancy Drew books for my wife's collection. She reads some every night and loves the stories and will want more of them.
5,A Pleasant Surprise,"Wow, I initially didn't expect a whole lot from this album but, boy, was I wrong.I've had this CD for about a year, but have only recently begun listening to it on a regular basis. The band is as talented and as tight as ever and Steve Lukather does a fantastic job at the helm on this release. I'm not going to belabor this review with a lot of text/hype. Not wanting to be redundant, but if you want blow-by-blow song info, then please feel free to read some of the other well-detailed reviews.This is a fantastic Toto album. It is musically diverse, but totally Toto. It's probably one of their best! If you are a fan of Toto (or have ever been one), and if you can find a copy of this CD, get it!!"
4,Stellar Work by Superb Studiomen,"Simon Phillips appears on ""Tambu"", replacing the long-time drummer Jeff Porcaro (deceased, natural causes), and seems to fit the Toto mold just fine; he also manages to stretch the skins on those drums a bit differently, to make his mark with Toto on this CD.I was very pleased with this CD, enjoying the skillful and slick packaging (made to look like a cheap dime thriller/novel, a la Indiana Jones) as well as the music inside. Toto's sharp licks on keys and guitar are the best in the industry - take a look at any of the other pop stars out there, and you'll see members of Toto listed among the musicians in their liner notes.Favorite songs include:I Will Remember / Slipped Away / If You Belong to Me / Time is the Enemy / Drag Him to the Roof / Dave's Gone Skiing / The Turning PointGood stuff from great guys.Peace Out."
4,La renaissance...,"Premier album enregistré avec Simon Phillips et co-produit par Elliot Scheiner ( Steely Dan, The Eagles ).TAMBU laisse une grande place à l'écriture plus qu' à la performance musicale, ce qui rend l'album plus proche de ce qu'ils faisaient à leur débuts.Cet album, comme tous ceux qui ont suivit "" TOTO IV "" , a un formidable succès en Europe et au Japon.Jenny D. McRae et John James font leur apparition.Il marque le renouveau du groupe, ainsi qu'un retour aux sources avec l'alternance de slows, et de morceaux rocks...Best : I Will Remember, If you belong to me, The Turning point, Gift of Faith, The Road Goes on.Plus d'info sur : www.totofrance.com"
5,Ahhh Jamaica,"""Rule of the Bone"" was my first introduction to Mr. Banks. What an adventure. He writes with spirit and so intelligently, once you read fine lit as this you see the rest of popular fiction for what it is. eck. Pick it up. It's smart, funny, If I still had my copy I share some of my favorite lines, I highlighted a bunch for his wit and insight. One of my favorites Russell Banks."
5,best book ever read,"THis book was really well written. I truly related to it. It was a hard book not to put down, I would read it 500 more times."
3,Almost right on,"There are some things about RULE OF THE BONE that are so close to home that they should pay rent. The voice of 'Bone' is for the most part, dead on, and an achievement itself. This book is almost a bit of masterwork, but the wizard is visible behind the curtain, if you look closely. 400 pages of action/inaction are betrayed by the numb ending, and the almost fable-like plot twists are visible from dozens of pages away. Yes, this is a better novel than many, a great bit of insight into characters that don't normally get a chance to breathe on the page, but there is something that seems manufactured here as well. I know I'm holding this one up to a higher sense of achievement, but to someone who has a good feeling for teen angst, he betrays it with his contrived story at times. Better than most, to be sure."
5,Awesome.,"This is the most involving novel I have read in years. In my opinion, Banks is an old school author like Dickens, Dostoyevsky, Twain, etc. Its' not a 'postmodern' book. But, on the other hand, it is more honest about how life is lived now. Banks' eye for detail is precise. I really had a feel for the scene, the characters were real, compelling. It's a classic."
4,thought it was good and enjoyed reading it,"This book was about a young boy named Chappie. He lived in a broken down home with his mother and stepfather. his real father lives in Jamaica(which Chappie finds out later on).Chappie ends up getting kicked out of his house and moving in with one of his good friend named Russ. He got kicked out of his house for smoking crack and not coming home. In the house he also lives with a gang of bikers. All they do is stay home, drink, do drugs and ride bikes. They were forced to move out of the house because of a fire. A lot of other stuff happened later on in the book. You should read this book to find out about the rest of the book. I really enjoyes reading the book. Every time I picked it up I never wanted to put it down. All I wanted to do was read."
4,Some of Petula's BEST tracks on this album,"OK. Overall, maybe this album doesn't necessarily rate 4 stars (there are a few weak songs that unfortunately pull the rating down a bit...), but - and here's the important part - this album contains some of the best recording work Petula Clark has ever done. Her recordings of ""Wedding Song"" & ""Solitaire"" are nothing short of magnificent. No exaggeration. Her voice has never been more solid, focused, expressive - while at the same time vulnerable & delicate. There are some other goodies on this set, too (expecially ""My Guy""), but it's the previously mentioned two that make this album a ""must have."" On a scale of 1-5, I give this album a 4 star rating. On a scale of 1-5, I give ""Wedding Song"" & ""Solitaire"" a SOLID 35!!!!!! Her voice will simply melt your heart on these songs."
4,Great Price for this Out of Print Book,"I ordered this book for my college age daughter for her architecture class. It is an out of print book. When my package came a cookbook was in it. I called the company and they tracked my book and found that my book and the cook book had been sent to the wrong people. They had me package up the cookbook and send it to the correct recepient and the lady that received my book sent it to me. This did take an extra week, but the company rembursed me for the postage and the entire cost of the book. So technically the book was free, minus the time it took to mail the cookbook. Luckily I didn't need the book until November so all is well."
5,Great pill container,"This pill container is great. It's compartments are large enough to hold all my pills and supplements (I take about 15 pills per day, most of them quite large) and the lids won't snap open accidentally in my purse. The clear carrying case does not have a lid, but holds the daily pill cases tightly enough that they won't fall out."
3,A murder mystery,"This novel set in the early 20th century reflects attitudes and morays of a byegone era. Most older books are well written and this is no exemption, except the story is ponderous and its conclusion and the solving of the murder is unsatisfactory, and unlikely to encourage readers to look at more books by this author."
2,Another collection of scholarship on the pre-Socratics,"I had to read this book for a class in pre-Socratic greek philosophy. It's not bad.Some of the perspectives are particularly useful and invite the reader to engage the pre-Socratics in a different light (the essays on Heraclitus are particularly good). Overall, however, the book doesn't GREATLY improve one's understanding. Most collections with pre-Socratic sections provide sufficient background (and sufficiently accessible).This book attempts to go to the next step; however, without an understanding of Greek you're going to have one heck of a time getting the subtleties. If you understand Classical Greek then you very well might get an extra few perspectives....but this is not that great of a book."
5,A stunning collection of great tunes,"Having been a Doobie Brothers fan for 20 plus years, it wasn't until 1990 that I saw them perform live. I have seen them 3 times since. I was convinced their onstage live energy couldn't be captured on ""vinal"" or CD. I was wrong. This is a terrific double album. Crystal clear sound, great selection of classic hits spanning the last 25 years.Even non touring ex-Doobie-Michael McDonald appears in several tunes (I guess there are no ex Doobies). Highly recommended!!!added for a few tunes."
4,a music fan from Illionois,Saw the Doobies Labor Day 1999 at a festival. Found this CD to be on par with that concert. This CD captures all the musical excitement that a festival setting can give. I recommend this CD to any Doobies fan or fan of music from the 70's.
5,This is EXCITING--- I must say,"I just wrote a review of The Best of Mississippi John Hurt. I'm now listening to the original Okeh sessions for the first time. Wow!The aforementioned CD and this gem show him at his sad-happy picking and storytelling best. I just love when he stops singing and let's the guitar finish the sentence. An incredible relaxed energy. Ain't No Tellin' and Stack O' Lee are my favorites; but it's all gold, baby"
1,Poor sound quality better to get the Yazoo release 1928 sessions,"Mississippi John Hurt was an amazing folk musician and these are some of his finest recordings. It's too bad that Columbia decided to use sonic solutions ""no noise"" processing on this release. Thankfully a much better release of the same material is available from Yazoo titled: The 1928 Sessions. The difference is between the two releases is so extreme it staggers the imagination how Columbia could have released this cd sounding so poorly."
5,Excellent reef product,Awesome reef sandals!I ordered two pairs for my sister for Christmas and they came just in time. True to their quality and size she was happy with the gift.
3,Not as comfortable as hoped.,I ordered these flip flops after hearing rave reviews about the Reef brand. I was pretty disapointed in the comfort of them. They are pretty narrow and the strap part cuts into my foot on the sides. I have looked at other Reef flip flops in stores and they seem to be thicker giving more padding. I have been wearing Nike comfort thongs for so many years it is hard to find a comfortable flip flop these days. Overall nicely made shoes for the price.
5,sweet rides!,Love Reef. The comfortable sole and little arch support make summer super fun! they last FOREVER and most import...they look fabulous. Highly recommend for value and quality.
3,Not worth the money,"I love rocket dog flip flops and was hoping this brand would have the same style. Wrong. They are narrow in the foot which is always annoying to me. They started off pretty tight, but quickly loosened up. The slogan on the box said ""ridiculously comfortable"" and I have to totally disagree. You can't stand up in these for more than a few hours and your feet are sore. I wore them on a shopping trip and by the end of it, my feet were killing me. I'd say they are not worth the money."
1,Doesn't fit...,"Is not true to size, a 9 is more like an 8 1/2 and the straps ride really really weird..."
1,Weird shape,These sandals are pretty. That's the only good thing I can say. Their shape is VERY weird. The sandal is VERY long from the toe piece forward and sticks out way beyond my toes. Then the shoe is way too short from the instep back. The straps are twisted and dig into my instep and the sides are taller than the middle. I've worn flip flops all my life. I don't know how this manufacturer thinks they can charge almost $20 for a shoe like this.
2,"toe bed too long, and too narrow","Although these flip flops look very nice, the toe bed is too long, I end up catching them on stairs and such, can't even consider wearing them at a rocky beach I'd be flat on my face. The width is also for a narrow foot, the straps are tight...If I hadn't worn them, I would have sent them back."
2,Hurts My Arch and Toes,"I had yet to find a Reef sandal I didn't like, until this one. The straps of the sandals are attached really far back on the foot bed. So far, that when I walk, it pushes on my arch. I've also noticed that when I walk my toes start to hurt after a while. I don't know if that has anything to do with the way the strap is pushing on my arch or what. I was hoping for more cushion as well. I am really disappointed with this sandal. I'll wear it to the mailbox, etc. but I'll keep looking for another all-day sandal. I am a size 7."
3,Purchase songs individually that you like,"I bought this for my husband who likes non mainstream Christmas music. We both listened to it together. His comments were ""How much did you pay for this?"" ""Maybe next time just buy songs individually that you have previewed"". We both noticed the volume changing periodically while listening. Also the sound quality was pretty poor. This really does sound like a mix tape, as in tape quality too. If this was on sale I might purchase it again with this knowledge, but I felt it was not worth the full price. BTW he did really like Little Stevens Underground Garage Christmas cd I bought.Christmas A Go-Go"
1,"Terrible, Terrible Sound Quality","The album contains some interesting improvisational music by some Scandinavian Artists. As usual though, I'll confine myself to the sound quality of the disks.Once again, extreme dynamic compression and clipping rule the day. I can't say for sure if the damage occurred during the recording, mixing, or mastering (probably all three); but it is constant and it is severe. And it may have been an artistic choice and not something designed merely to create the loudest possible record as these guys are artistes. Regardless, what could have been fantastically dynamic and engaging music instead boarders on noise. Unless you are a fan of Merzbow type assaults and effective dynamic ranges of 3 dB, you'll prolly be reaching for the eject button before finishing the first disk.Thee sound quality really deserve a zero rating, and in my opinion these disks are un-listenable.See wikipedia ""loudness war"" for some info, or google 'pleasurize music'"
3,Read his other works first...,"Read Lewis's popular works first: Screwtape, The Great Dirvorce, Mere Christianity, etc...This is not his best work, but true fans may want to read Lewis's first apologetic work. It is easy to read, but difficult to comprehend. Lewis tries to say too much in each symbol, or perhaps the symbols are too abstract."
3,Slightly UN-satisfactory,"I've loved the other books in the UN-series. And Unmasked is a decent read, but not as breathtaking as the other books.Previouse hero Zain Masters little sister is in trouble on her first piloting mission for the family shipping company. Her troublr is space pirate Qaade Deter whose plundering her ship. Unknown to Torrie, our heroine, Qaade is stealing badly needed medical supplies for his secret ring of slave assitance. Think a futuristic underground railroad for slaves who have had their memories completely erased. Ofcourse when she catches up with him and unmasks him, the two work together to end the illegal slave trade in their sector. All together it is a little formulaic. There are really no twists. And unlike the other UN books which had great riddles and puzzles and adventure, this one is just muddling its way to the finish line of a romance. That's not to say that it won't entertain you. But it just isn't memorable."
5,SO MUCH FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My 6 year old and 3 year old thought the movie was great. I thought it would be a bit intense for the 3 yr. old but she didn't show any signs of being frightened. She would yell out to the dinosaur to get out of the way, and to hurry up and move but would then tell me how much fun the movie is. I thought the graphics were fantastic!!!! It was alot of fun and exciting. Parents and kids would both enjoy this movie. Although my 3 yr. old enjoyed it, I would have to say that it is intense so do use caution with the younger crowd."
5,GREAT MOVIE!!,I just bought this for my 4 year old son who is facinated with dinosaurs - what a great movie!! I don't even mind watching this one over & over!! Great present for any child who loves dinosaurs!!
3,Not for young children,"This movie looked great for older kids, but I bought it for my toddler because he loves dinasours - BIG mistake. It is very scary. From the very beginning, little cute ones are being chased and eaten by the big ones, etc. My toddler had bad dreams for a week and he only watched 5 minutes of it. Beware."
5,Awsome images,This film worth the blue ray resolution. Now you can see the beautiful scenery and enjoy the texture of the animals.
5,#9 ON MY TOP TEN FAVORITE MOVIES LIST,"Kids movies seem a bit out of place in my top ten list especially since they're surrounded by mostly R-rated movies. But somehow this movie squeezed in that adult-movie gap. I was honestly surprised by how good this movie is, especially since they managed to cram a PG-13 level of violence into a PG film. I even counted how many deaths there were in the movie(Nine in total, and that's not even counting the island of lemurs and the island of dinosaurs that were destroyed by the meteor shower that occurs). It's too bad though Disney really sucks nowadays. I would recommend even the most R-rated infatuated movie-lovers this film because of how excellent it is and surprisingly violent and interesting. It's also too bad we'll probably never see a film from Disney like this again."
3,"""Dinosaur"" falls short","Computer graphics were incredible but a lack of attention to detail and a weak story make this film fall way short of expectations. With the money Disney put into this project, couldn't someone have told them that grasses and dinosaurs didn't coexist. And the highly evolved ""lemurs"" make as much scientific sense as having caveman attacking the dinos not to mention the weak story line. A real disappointment in terms of realism. Get ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" instead."
5,My son loves this movie,"My son loves dinosaurs so of course it would be fitting to get the movie DINOSAUR. I had to end up buying it because we kept renting it on the kindle, that's how much he watched it.... As soon as it goes off he's back watching it again."
1,Add me to the list - it doesn't play on my JVC,"I'll have to take it back tonight.When I put it in my player it just spits it back out. Sorry, I don't know the model number, but it is a JVC.I tried it in my computer w/DVD player and it worked just fine. That's not where I want to sit the kids to watch movies, though, so I'll just trade it in for the VHS."
1,DVD Release - Dinosaur of a Disaster,"My complaint, like so many others, is that the dvd simply DOES NOT WORK ON MOST PLAYERS. I was *loaned* the VHS. Add me (and my JVC X-501BK) to the growing list of disgruntled dvd owners. I have an opened dvd that I cannot return for a refund --- only as an exchange due to store policy. Smile Buena Vista, JVC techs pointed the finger at you immediately. Evidently their support people have been hammered with inquiries on this issue. The back of the Dinosaur DVD says that it is a ""region 1"" dvd -- my dvd player plays ""region 1"" dvds. Oooooops, all except this one. Could this be construed as false advertising?Johnny Cochran, where are you?"
2,"Only a ""Land before time: Journey to Happy Valley""","I am very disapointed with its poor story and unavoidable advertisements at the beginning. It will be better to put a subtitle of ""Land before time: Journey to Happy Valley."" I didn't know that Disney and Universal Studio shares the story. The picture was excellent when I didn't know that was combination of real and computer animation. I was wondering how they realized the texture and details of nature on computer. But it was only my ream--most of them except characters were just a digitized image of here and there. Already lots of people have done that and lot of them has good story too. The worst was that the advertisement before you get to the menu. I always hated those and this DVD has about 7 of them. I had to keep hitting skip track button to get to the menu. I paid the money to see the movie without any interruption but they don't allow me. BAD Disney!"
4,Awsome movie,"This movie has some of the best special effacts I have ever seen. Action packed thriller. Great story, breath taking, good lessons in life. The picture was perfect. Right from the digital source. Great depth, no enhancement, no dirt. Great sound. Effects and music are suppreme. The Carnotors roar I thought was weak but besides that nothing wrong with the sound. It has lots of bounus material to give you all the details on how these amazing effects were pulled off. Most of the deleted scenes shouldn't have been deleted. The game Aladars adventure had awsome graphics and was good. I think the only big problem with this movie was its numerous scientific errors. There were no lemurs at the time of the dinosaurs, raptors had feathers, there was no grass at the time, igaunadons had beaks and stood on two legs more often. Still a good movie."
3,Seeing is believing,"Let's face it, Land Before Time has a more complex plot and better characterization, but that's far from the whole story. Visually this is a real marvel. In years to come it may be studied along side King Kong due to its innovative combination of real locations and computer animation. Rent it and see what you think - you may want to add it to your collection."
3,Great Custmer service....,I purchased this dvd. It came exactly as advertised. Package and dvd looked like new...for some reason I could not get the movie to play in any of my players. Seller was very nice about the problem. Returned my money immediately. I would do business with them again. It was just one of those things that happens on occasion. Great customer service.Lisa
2,"interesting reference, but useless by itself","The book consists of a hodge podge of falsettas. There is nothing ""progressive"" about it, and there are no ""studies"". I own all of Serrano's material, and many falsettas in the book are nothing more than his concert selections broken down into snippets. I guess the book can be used as a reference to enrich your guitar pieces that you have learned from some other source, but by itself, it is overwhelming and useless -- you are better off with Juan Martin books.About the book format: it is huge and unwieldy. I saw other reviewers complain about it, but didn't think much of it till I got the book. Since it doesn't have a spiral binding and it is an inch thick, you can't even open it on the sheetmusic stand without breaking the binding.If you can, buy this book 'used' like I did. It's not worth $45. I bought it for $20, and therefore don't mind as much having spend the money on something that I won't use."
2,Doesn't last over time,"First of all, measure your sink carefully. This thing stick out quite a bit in my small sink. My fault for not checking that. We've had it for almost a year and the white coating has peeled off in many spots, allowing the metal underneath to rust. All we ever store in this is a tiny bottle of dish soap and a sponge so it must have been nicked by dishes and utensils in the sink and those tiny nicks got bigger over time. We've gone back to just setting our stuff on the counter next to the sink. I do not recommend this item unless you have a huge sink and can keep all your dishes, etc. away from it."
3,Card from the dark side,recv'd timely but the cards have a black face which makes them hard to see.These cards are from the dark side...
5,have fun!!,"If you use to play with cards, dont miss the oportunity to try this excellent cards.I use to play with Kem cards(wich are excellent)but copag does not nothing to envy that cards.The price is awesome and the quality better, dont hesitate and try it now!!!!"
4,Entertaining tale,"This is not a bad book at all. It is the story of Charles Willeford, the clever creator of the Hoke Moseley crime series, when he was riding the rails (living on the road and catching trains by hopping onto them as they moved) as an early teen (about 12-14).It is not a long book (about 140 pages) and worth the time reading about the authors experiences in the Great Depression.If I had to nitpick, it would be that the writer doesn't really tell attention grabbing stories, they are ok but not the kind of stories that you remember after the book is finished."
3,Read with caution....,"I concur with a recent review of a reader who stressed the need for ""discernment"" when reading the ""Left Behind"" series. I initally picked up the first book because I thought it was religious science fiction .... which is exactly what it was...no clue this was a best selling series in the Christian community. There is an obvious bent toward the male-dominated, religious far right. The ""dumb blond"" sterotype portrayed in Hattie, and the way the issue of abortion was addressed...were actually laughable, but not in a comedic sense. While quick, mostly entertaining reading (read from a sci fi perspective), I fear there are many who read these books as ""gospel"" -- a bit scary to say the least!"
2,The Mark,"The story is great, but the condition of the book was less than what I expected. All of the pages are brown and tear easily. The purchase that I selected was classified as ""new"". I was disappointed."
4,What Happens When The World is MARKED??,"Book #8 reveals the ""Mark of Loyalty"" to Carpathia, or the Antichrist, and all who refuse it are beheaded. Or so it seems...This book follows suit with those before it and it is an intriguing and addicting tale about those Left Behind after the Rapture. I am enjoying the whole series and recommend the books to believers and non-believers alike.One comment on the previous reviewer, stating that he cannot recommend the books cased on the fact that a believer ""takes"" the mark of the beast in this book. You don't have the whole story. You must read on into the next book, #9 Desecration, to see what really happened with this believer. The authors only give you a glimpse of the issue in book #8.I'm continuing with this great series!!"
3,This should be over,C'mon look at this waste of book. These books should have ended a long time ago. Mr. Lahaye you should stop bible thumping for 200 pages and preach somewhere else. Just give us good books with a spiritual message and quit trying to be a pastor.
5,the mark was a very good book,well i do not read these kinds of book but a friend of mine bought the left behind series snd i was hooked this is the best book of the series
3,A Disappointment,"After the wait, The Mark was a disappointment. It was good to see what happened with the Tribulation Force, but there were too many jumps in the storyline--especially toward the end. LaHaye and Jenkins have written much better books in this series, and I hope their next book is in keeping with the earlier books."
3,The Weakest Book of the Series,I felt that The Mark lacked the plot and action that the other books had. It seemed to be a transitional book. There really was no point to it except for the initiation of the mark. Other than a few good pages on the prisons the book was boring. I would still read it though just to get to the later books that will be better.
2,Time to Give it a Rest,"I did rather enjoy the first 4 books in the series, but it is really starting to drag. 8 books and only 3 1/2 years into the Tribulation? When you consider the 40 million+ in book sales then it is easy to get the impression that they want to ""milk this cash cow"" for all it's worth. I don't plan to buy any more books, because I only have to read Revelation to know what will happen in the end (if they ever get around to it!)"
4,Another way of approaching Revelations,"Book starts with the cast of characters divided into Believers, Professed Believers, Enemies, and Undecided. This cast changes slightly from book to book, but Rayford, Buck, Chloe, and Tsion Ben-Judah are still here. The story takes place after the resurrection of Nicolae and the indwelling of Satan. For economic and security reasons, all members of the Global Community must bear the mark of the Beast. Now, all the believers must prepare to hide.This book, as are others in the series, difficult to read without reading the series in order. Without understanding the history of the characters and understanding what has happened to the world, you will be lost. Some elements of the story take a couple of books to work through, so just reading one will not allow you to see how it started or ended. The character of Hattie Durham is an example of this.I would recommend this book if you have read the preceding books."
2,The Mark,"It appears that the authors are trying to stretch out the series in order to maximize book sales. I really enjoyed the first few books in the series, but the last few have started to aggravate my interest and are bordering on insulting. I think that they should get on with the story. I do plan to read the next one but if it drags on I will not pursue it any further.I have spoken with a few other people with a similiar opinion."
3,WORST OF THE EIGHT AND STILL NOT BAD,MUCH TO MY DISSAPOINTMENT AFTER WAITING 5 MONTHS FOR IT TO COME OUT IT DID NOT MEET MY EXPECTATIONS SO THEREFORE I THOUGHT IT WAS WEAK. ASSSAINS IS BY FAR THE BEST OF THE SERIES AND THIS BOOK IS NO COMPARISON
1,Three and a Half Years to Go . . .,"We're halfway through the Tribulation and at 44 years-old, I am wondering if I will live long enough to see this series end. If the remainder of the books drag like this one did, there are probably 20 or 30 more to come. At one every nine or so months . . . well, you do the math. I honesty have never read worse.But, yes. I read all the others. Elementary school-level writing, cardboard characters and oh-so-painfully-bad dialog didn't deter me. Somehow, the story kept things moving along and I became addicted. The Mark, however, has no story. Just 300+ pages of filler (mostly dialog) that left me irritated and feeling ripped-off at the end. Skip this one and find something better to do with a rainy afternoon. I promise you won't be missing a thing because truly, nothing happens. Another bomb like The Mark and all future Left Behind installments will be left behind from my reading list.One star for marketing."
1,Book 8??? How about shameless salesmanship?,"I agree with an earlier reviewer in that I bought the book because I had been hooked into the series. It soon became clear that Book 8 is a shameless shell that acts only as a bridge, or leader, into subsequent books.I'll read the rest of the series; however, the authors can rest assured that I'll cost share with other readers."
4,These ladies ARE special.....,"The ""Last Shout"" is a fun adventure with Eddie, played & written by Jennifer Saunders and Patsy, played by Joanna Lumley. But ""In New York"" can be a little tedious and off track. But anything this duo does is usually downright funny! So take a pill, fill your glass, light a cigarette, turn on the tele and enjoy! Or as the girls like to put it: ""Chain smoking, pill popping, drunken insanity""! Cheers darling!"
4,works with Sony DSC-F707,"I just got this and tried it with my 5.1MP Sony DSC-F707. On ""normal mode"" I was unable to transfer videos, therefore I tried the PTP USB connection. It worked great and took just over 6 minutes to transfer 110 MB of photos."
3,Not nano compatible,#1 it is slower than a USB 1.1 synch.#2 it eats battery fast.#3 not for a pro photographer or digital point and shoot cameras over 7 megapixel.#4 does not synch to nano 1st or 2nd generation.
4,works great if you think ahead,we are using this on vaction and so far it fine...we charge the ipod before going to dinner and transfer the photos while relaxing before bed. Then recharge the ipod overnight..if works well for 256 memory stick we shoot 4 a day ibout and tranfer them at night. 4 strs only because it does not work well with my camera only my wifes...i use 4 and 6 gig cards in a d200 and it simply will not do it without stopping to recharge and then when you do it wants to start over...so I would say great for the average user but not for those using very large file formats.
2,Good Idea... Bad Engineering,"The Apple Ipod Camera Connector screams intelligence on the part of Apple, but falls far short. DO NOT think of using this for any real photography purposes or with pictures above 3MP in size. To transfer 1gb Sandisk II ultra CF card takes roughly 45 minutes, and kills almost all your Ipod's battery (not to mention the impact on your cameras battery for that 45 minutes).Its a great idea, but the ipod battery is not originally engineered to support such a power supply, and does not stand up to heat...Look elsewhere for a portable harddrive to store pictures, such as Epson P-2000."
4,School sucks,"One thing that made me wonder when I read this back in its day was that Claudia's parents never thought to home-school her or put her in a different school or anything. She is also compared to her older (and genius) sister Janine unfairly, so when Claudia is forced to go back to the seventh grade, I was thinking, oh no. Fortunately she does well enough to eventually be able to go back to eighth grade. She is a very creative mind, and figures out a few ways to get through class."
5,Claudia Is Queen,This was a very good book.Claudia made some new friends in 7th grade in BSC #101 Claudia Kishi Middle School Drop Out.Then her teacher Mrs.Amer says she's not a STAR student she says Claudia you're going have to go back to 7th grade says Mrs Amer.She said you'll start on Monday.
4,I don't usually have problems with Apple DVDs but...,"For some odd reason, all the DVD+Rs in the package were unusable. Maybe something went wrong with the grouping, or the package in transit. Otherwise, Apple is the onlly brand of DVD+R that works on my Apple."
5,Great worth the price,"The day I got them for my teddy bear hamster he was so happy he was sleeping and I put one of the cheese flavored drops next to his nose he woke rite up and started eating his treat when he was done he wanted more so cute, but I only give him one or two a day Very good treats for hamsters well for mine anyway."
5,A Must-have For Your Library.,"There are a very few books on writing that make a significant and immediate impact, and this is one of them. The experience of reading it is like a paradigm-shift of your thinking about how to express yourself clearly and effectively in print. Gunning also researched what makes readers happy and unhappy, turns them on-and turns them off. You would think writers would have mastered the lessons in this book during the fifty-plus years it's been around; but they havent. And once you read this book youll notice awful writing everywhere! Grab a copy!"
4,Often very funny,"I knew nothing about this going in, never saw the original, and all in all found it quite hilarious. It's Fraser's baby, and he shows far more comic range than I would have given him credit for. He is remarkably funny as almost all of the characters he plays here. Hurley is also pretty solid (as 'twere), and in general this is a great light-hearted romp."
3,Don't buy this DVD,"I saw this movie in the theaters, and I can't stress enough what a snoozfest this movie is. I'm sure you all know what it's about so I'm not gonna write out the whole plot. The only reason I stayed awake during this movie was for some of the sexy outfits Elizabeth Hurly wore. But other than that, this movie is terribly written, the only funny are what you see in the trailers, do yourself a favor, save yourself some money and don't buy this."
3,From Great To Not so Great,"The acting throughout the movie was very good, so that wasn't the problem. The problem was that the first 85% of the movie was good and really funny, but the ending wasn't so great - actually it wasn't good at all. That just ruined it. However, this movie did give off a good theme/message, so it was ok in some ways...But doesn't a good movie need a good ending????"
5,"Great,","I really like this movie. I also like the special features. This movie is real cheap to buy so I suggest you buy this. This is a great remake of the 1967 movie. Its like the same thing but the devil is a dude,not a women. This really great and so is this dvd. Theres just something about this movie that is cool. I dont know but you know, its cool. This movie is really funny. If you havent seen this movie you definatley have to see this movie. Elizabeth Hurley is real hot, shes kind of freaky sometimes but you know she is real hot. She was hot in Austin Powers and now this. Brendan Frasier is good in this movie too. He's also good in Monkeybone...you need to watch that too. I know it looks stupid, but seriously its funny. If its not, I dont know but ya.."
3,Scott Porter was yum.,I watched it for early Scott Porter and he did not disappoint. The movie overall was darker than I expected.
1,"This ruined the time that was meant to be ""wasted""","Even with the bar not even off the ground it was raised too high to receive anything that might be acknowledged as a recommendation for this film. Dull, predictable without wit, lame comedy attempts, horrible acting, bad writing, and a cut that leaves room to be desired. Yup, if you want to waste even the time meant to be wasted, don't watch this."
5,I was there.,"The book ""Site 18"" written by Richard E. Waldron is, in my opinion, nothing short of a masterpiece. In the short stories he tells you can almost see the characters as well as smell the seaweed, the fish, the crabs and the honeybuckets.The book tells how life on a remote radar site during the Korean War and the Cold War was, and how miserable the remoteness and the winters at the radar sites on Hokkaido were.What I remember most is how the young men in that place and at that time made the most of it. They did not question why they were there; they just did their job - just like the young men did in all the wars before Korea and all the wars after Korea. There were some tragic times and there were some good times; there were some sad times and some happy times.I for one enjoyed the book. I was there.Al SettingNovato, California"
1,One of a kind!! Sure it is...,"I'm not going to talk about CT skill. Let's face it, he knows what to do when approaching the sequencing and mixing stage. Here is to put my **** rate.Considering this album...here is the real COUNTERFEITER. A bit of inventive has been laid upon at the time to choose which contemporary techno-derived-genre is available to cover some of the most predictable DM tunes. Here goes a **.But don't make a mistake!Even at the time of showing us his original material CT lacks of creativity... again: ""take the short way and walk it"", will he be there sooner?, error, not even closer.You guys, keep on supporting DM albums, you can even go and get Gore or Gahan's solo works [not even David himself can emulate Martin's songs] or the highly recommended Recoil stuff.As to a DM pseudo tribute album...hmm...you really need one?Pick ""A TRIBUTE TO THE MASSES"". Though it is not that good it has some funny things from well known artists and their trade mark styles."
5,A very good book.,"Many questions are good and useful for preparing the USMLE, not only for step 1 but also for step 2."
3,Could've been better,"Not a bad dvd, but alot was missing here. I didn't like the voiceover recap before each match. I prefer hearing from the wrestlers not a promo-type hype."
3,I'm looking forward to reading more Carroll,"I've been looking for some new books to read, and when I ran across rave reviews of Jonathan Carroll's novels, I hoped I'd found an author I would really enjoy. ""Land of Laughs"" is the first Carroll book I've read.It was an enjoyable read, and held my attention, but it was neither as clever nor creative as I'd expected after reading the other reviews. The dialogue seemed stilted to me, and the plot was a variation on a theme I've read many other times.Still, it's an impressive first novel, and I can tell he's an author who writes the sorts of books I particularly like to read. I'm looking forward to reading more of his stuff."
2,One Word: Blah,"A very bland tale. Where is the mystery? I am afraid that Joyce Christmas has lost her touch. This tale about pseudo-satanists and angst-ridden teenagers is obvious and totally charmless, most unlike the three previous Betty Trenka mysteries. Has Joyce lost her touch?"
3,Why on earth is this listed under classical music?,"Pavarotti has a short but excellent repertoire that belongs in ""Classical Music"" (e.g. Fille du Regiment), however 99% of his recordings belong in Popular Music. Amazon folks, please get your act straight on this guy and his other two tenor friends!"
2,The Very Best Of Luciano Pavarotti,"This weekend I purchased ""The Very Best of Luciano Pavarotti"", Romantica. The first track, Caruso is terrible. Classical music, opera, etc, should never be played with synthesized anything! This is especially true with voices like Pavarotti's. This first track was CHEAP and tinny sounding.Pavarotti is good, but I think that the title is misleading.Classical music should be with real musical instruments. Lesson #1, if it takes electricity, it's NOT a musical instrument.My $.02"
2,poor,The brush heads that I got fit the motor but they were a poor after market some won't even turn..?????
2,ROLLING TOTE BAGG does not fit under front seat on plane!,"Being a Baaggallini fan who owns and enjoys five different bags, I was very disappointed in the Rolling Tote Bag. It is heavy to lift when it is empty and could never fit under the front seat of a plane even if you jammed it. The flight attendant was holding back a smile when I told her it was ""supposed"" to slip under the seat in front of me. So keep in mind that it is cute, rolls well but will NOT ever fit under any seat on any plane and it is very heavy to lift into the overhead."
4,Good Job,"A whopping good read. You have to admit that this ghostly (not ghastly) affair was a great plot idea. Very original. Ironically, the book's strength is also its weakness. Ms Ansa has a gift for local color and scenic description, with a tendency to go a little bit overboard, which makes for slow, but interesting reading. I bought the book in the spring and could not get past page 10. I started and stopped, started and stopped. But the lush writing was so skillful that I vowed to finish it. Then when summer came and I had a little vacation time, I zipped right through it. Lena is an intriguing character. I must go back and read Baby of the Family now to get the rest of her story."
5,an excellent read!,"Once you pick this book up, you will not be able to put it down. I actually cried when Herman left. What a beautiful love story!"
4,Keeps your attention;a page turner,"I really liked this book. I felt as if I knew the life of the main character Lena. I could really identify with some of the spirtual phenomenon that she experienced in her life. Not so much the ghosts; but the heightened perception of my surroundings and the people in my life. I think that Ms Mcelroy-Ansa wrote a book about taking control of your own life and everything that goes with it. Some people achive that through therapy; some through events in their lives and some are just lucky enough to to find the real love and caring of a good mate to help them become more secure in who they are and most of all just learn to love and be happy. I normally read Anne Rice novels about ghosts and witches but I think a lot of the folklore in this book is so close to the grain and being from the rural south I've heard a lot of the stories and tales. Read it with an open mind it is very entertaing,just like listening to an old friend tell you a story."
5,Just a described,"The weather doesn't affect the appearance or quality of this sundial. It is a nice gift for new homeowners, too."
2,Not what I expected... there's no guitar!,"Ummm... well, Nuno's a killer guitarist, for sure, but this album sounds an awful lot like a Paul Gilbert album minus the guitar. I think Nuno is trying to be a songwriter here, which is fine, but I wanted a guitar album. There are no instrumentals and no real solos. Maybe you'll like the songs; I thought they were lame, but I'm no expert on lyrical quality. I can say that musically they're nothing special. And come on Nuno, where's the guitar?!?"
5,he wasn't only idol here since this CD,"hello from japan.yes,what do you think?America?is true.we were also see him by idol for every young japanese girls.but this CD is NOT.it always happen since cheaptrick,queen(!).of course the beatles!?I wonder how he impress by US music fans.I think five stars were right by the musical quality-awared from japanese music fan-buy this first before try to other his CD.front cover is himself."
3,Avery good buy,"This remains an excellent buy, the information enclosed, essential fundamentals. This edition does not have the slick color illustrations of what is edible and what isn't that the original does. This does nothing to diminish what it DOES contain.A good item for any outdoorsman's shelf"
4,"Ok, But...","I like this book and enjoyed reading it. However, I agree with a previous reviewer who recommended Greg Davenport's books (Wilderness Living and Wilderness Survival) in addition to or instead of the US Army Survival Manual. Davenport covers the same material but avoids all the military issues found in this manual."
4,good,"product came as advertised and in a timely manner. The manual has basic survival information, and I keep it in my pack for when I go on long distance hikes."
5,The family Medical Encyc. is an excellent book. I love it,"Family Medical Encyclopedia is an excellent book. It explains complicated matters--illnesses,possible treatment, and medicines-- in terms easy to understand, and covers the human anatomy in smart graphs that give their relative place in the body. In spite of having been published years back, the book is very helpful TODAY. I love Dr. Justus J. Schifferes' MEDICAL ENCYCLOPEDIA."
4,Pretty good.,"This music video is about 20 minutes long has 3 music videos, and has interviews of the band. The three music videos, ""Roots Bloody Roots"", ""Ratamahatta"", and ""Attitude"", are very creative videos. The ""Roots Bloody Roots"" music video is kind of lame. The ""Ratamahatta"" music video however is an unbelievable entirely clay video! ""Attitude"" is another great video that has the Ultimate Fighting Championship in it. These three videos are pretty good, but it's short length and the fact that these songs aren't Sepultura's best that I can't give this album a full five stars."
5,Great book!!!,This book is wonderful. It is full of everything you need to know about St. John. I can't wait to get to St. John again and this time use this book and see parts of the island which I have never seen before. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is planning a trip to St. John.
1,"Nickelodeon, You Should Be Ashamed of Yourselves","You have the balls to release the TV cut on DVD, AND in fullscreen with no extra features? How asinine. What's funnier, is that the 4kids company has the full version for ""FREE"" on their website still.For any of those that still would like to see the full version of this film, go here---> [...]Until you fix this problem, none of the fans are going to buy this DVD. Good luck with that one..."
1,Load of BS,"Fantastic flick but the dvd is total garbage! Rehashed dvd cover of previous dvds, without the orginal turtles! Why not use the artwork, such as the poster, for the dvd cover? This is just pure lazyness from people who don't care about the fans, who just want a quick buck. The movie itself is the edited version, which if had any faults was the missing 9 mins, that were cut for commercials, which resulted in some plot confusion. Viacom(paramount/nickelodean)at least put some effort towards giving us a good dvd. The TMNT has always been given a the short end of the stick when it comes to dvds, so I expected it. Viacom could've won fans, by finally giving tmnt what they deserve, but they instead do what everyone else did."
5,When is the Film going to be released ??,"I have coincidentally stayed in all of the hotels and many of the locations mentioned in this extraordinary cant-put-down book : This is the true story of an elite group of vigilantes drawn from the ranks of select British paramilitary operatives, who were charged with eliminating four contract killers so deft that their hits appeared to be merely accidents. Hollywood Script Writers take note.... this would make a great story line !"
5,Vintage Spyro Gyra,"Excellent live collection of Spyro Gyra creations. It's got the obligatory ""Morning Dace"" and ""Shaker Song"" with some band favorites thrown in for a deeper flavor. The recordings convey the enthusiasm of the crowd and the band's rapport with them. Particularly good is ""Latin Streets,"" the band's farewell encore, including a fantastic, smooth, and rocking guitar solo as the band just sits back and enjoys their music and our enjoyment of it as well."
2,Implies J++ 1.1will work with example code - mine didn't!,"The cover says it includes MS Visual J++ 1.1 Trial edition. I already have MS VJ++1.1, and don't want to overlay with the trial version, so I would expect my J++ 1.1 to work with the code - it doesn't. In the very first example, the import looks for java.sql.*; J++ 1.1 that I already have doesn't contain this package; not sure I'm going be be able to continue with the book now!"
3,Database programming with java?? Look here for a good start,I have found this book to be a good starting place for anyone that would like to write database apps in java. Yes you to can build a database application for the web in no time.
2,Did not like it....,"I love romantic comedies and really enjoyed 13 going on 30 and i thought catch and release would be another one just like it but it was anything but funny. I did not laugh once, the acting was okay but not the best and the storyline was not right to me. In the movie Jennifer plays Gray a woman who is dealing with her fiancee's death and staying with his two friends she finds out somethings about her finacee that is suprising since she was with him for 6 years and never knew about it which is not really an original suprise. And basically in teh end she ends up with the guy that is completely wrong for her. Basically, a boring, dramatic film that does not really end with a happy ending."
4,Cute,"I wouldn't call this move wonderful. The plot moves quite fast and the lead lady's transformation was also quick. It was also mostly predictable. If you're looking for spectacular acting from Jennifer Garner and Timothy Olyphant, you won't get that. The characters are pretty stereotyped. However he has great smouldering eyes and a look definitely spoke a thousand words. All in all, I liked it. It's an entertaining chick flick, a nice romantic mental getaway."
3,Light but fun,"Catch and Release [Blu-ray]. Although we enjoyed this film, it was certainly light weight. Felt the ending could have been stronger - especially since we knew a change was coming for the entire movie. On the other hand, when you've dealt with business, office politics, and problems all week long, this film is a keeper for those times when you just do NOT want to think. Jennifer Garner is a delight in anything she does, so it's not a bad film. Just light, blu-ray film. Sometimes there is not a thing wrong with that!!"
2,This was not a good movie. At all.,Kevin Smith was the only good thing about this movie. Otherwise it was horrible. One big advertisement for why not to live in Boulder. Horrible movie.
2,Wrong item...,"...so sent it back with an explanation of exactly what I need-over 3 weeks ago, but havent heard anything back."
1,Too great a price,"My question is whether the author has ever seen the show? It sounds like she may have seen the movie since she says Daniel is blond, but other than having the names right, I'm not sure we're even talking about the same people. If you manage to make it through the holes and uneven development, then you'll probably be disappointed by the ending. Very rushed and unsatisfying. If I hadn't given one of the new authors a chance, I wouldn't have ever picked up another novelization."
2,Not my cup of tea..,"McConnell's first original novel was 'The Price You Pay'. The general idea is good, a typical trip to a planet that gives up people for hosts so they won't be destroyed by the Gou'ald. Some good dialogue. Nice descriptions of settings. Jack in his top sarcastic form. The main problems are how short the book is - making the pace rather rushed and the end rather unsatisfying - and the somewhat lumpy characterization and technical plot holes. Both of those can probably be explained by how early in the series the book was written, but they're still... painful."
3,I'm not sure,"I couldn't tell any difference in my milk supply after using this. I had better luck with fenugreek. I think every woman just has to figure out which product works for her body. I did like the easy to use liquid ( I hate swallowing pills ), and this product was shipped with a nice colorful catalogue of products for a nursing mother. Great company and lots to offer. They threw in a free sample of nipple ointment."
2,It didn't work for me,"Although I suspect the product itself is just fine, it didn't work for the purpose I bought it for (increasing lactation). I saw no difference in my milk production, though I believe the size of my breasts increased.But it might work for you -- worth a try!"
2,Hard to Wash Out,"We tried the ""Earthbath Puppy Shampoo"" on our little Jack Russell pup twice and didn't like it. The shampoo smells nice and suds up well, but it was very difficult to wash out, and Jacks have short hair! I can't imagine what it would be like to have to wash the residue out of a longer hair dog.Pam T~"
2,not so great,"I bought the tea tree ""flavor"" for an itchy dog based on all the good reviews, but wasn't impressed. After the bath, she still smelled like wet dog and later that day I noticed she had dandruff which she almost never gets, so it seems to have actually not cured her itching but given her dandruff. It also leaked all over the packaging which was a bit annoying."
5,The best dog shampoo,"This is the best shampoo, it is so gentle and smells so good. I have Yorkies and their eyes get in bad shape, I never have any problem putting this shampoo below their eyes to clean them,it is so gentle. Great Product"
4,Feels good,"Cleans my hair, smells/feels good, lathers easily. I like that it uses oatmeal and aloe. What more can I say?"
5,Best Shampoo,"If you love your dog like I do, this is the shampoo to get. NO harsh chemicals that are in 98% of all pet shampoos. Leaves my pup smelling fantastic. Don't use anything else."
1,Doesn't work for feral cat feeding station,I kept this product on level ground and had cardboard underneath it. The next morning I found multiple slugs and one silverfish eating their fill in the bowl.
2,Work fine if you like walkie-talkie distortion,"I bought these because my hearing is bad and I wanted to hear the TV without annoying the rest of my family. I will use them but they have a lot of distortion if the volume is turned up beyond a minimal level (on the TV). I don't have the humming that others have found and I can go anywhere in the house without much loss.However, the sound quality isn't there. It is way too high on treble and the distortion is annoying. I'd return them but I had to butcher the box plastic sealed box to get them open and then threw the box away before I tested them enough."
4,"Question for current owenrs,","I recently bought these headphones. My question is have any one of you changed the batteries on these? I don't see any battery chamber or anything like that. And if you have changed the batteries, are they special or regular rechargable AA batteries?Your response is appreciated.Thanks."
3,Not so good,"Pros: Very nice sound fidelity when you finally manage to get a good signal.Cons: Very limited transmission distance, 30 feet max. A lot, and I mean a lot of noise regardless of how close you are to the transmitter. It is off and on. Sometimes it's none and sometimes it constant even when you put the tranmitter 1 foot form the headphones. I've been disappointed. I expected a lot better from Panasonic.This is the second pair of Wireless headphone that I have purchased. The other was from Radio Shack and cost about the same. I didn't have the noise problem and the distance range was far greater. They broke after 8 months. The Panasonic has better sound fidelity."
5,Reseña precisa y concisa,"Como cada vez que sale un disco de Cerati, surge la pregunta: ¿Será mejor que el anterior? Una vez más Gustavo demuestra estar muy adelante de cualquier expresión rockera a nivel latinoamericano con su última producción donde fusiona elementos del rock actual con su talento y nos invita a viajar con él. Retomando las guitarras y dándoles un tinte más actual, éste disco es una verdadera joya. Imperdible para los fans, necesita algunas escuchadas, pero una vez que cale, se conviertirá en uno de tus favoritos."
3,&#65533;Hacia donde ir&#65533;s?,"Ok en mi opinion pienso q Cerati aun no ha encontrado un punto exacto en el cual encajar en la musica prueba nuevas cosas siempre pero se va a los extremos en Bocanada hay un buen trabajo pero a medida el disco avanza se torna demasiado electronico, cosa que en Siempre es Hoy tambien se dio pero a pesar de eso hay muy buenas cancione que hacen que esas producciones valgan la pena.En este ultimo trabajo nos presenta una faceta mas rockera pero mucho mas simple, hay algunas canciones que son similares, en realidad me he llevado un poco de decepcion pq esperaba mucho mas, tiene temas pasables mas no marcables en el disco.La pregunta seria... ?esta bueno el disco? no puedo decir que no, pero no cumplio mis expectativas."
2,No pero no,"Otra vez nada. Otra vez Cerati haciendo voces que no puede hacer. Si bien Cerati era el 99.99% de Soda Stereo, el trabajo de Zeta y Alberti era no dejar a Cerati hacer lo que se le ocurriera, ellos eran el balance para evitar que salgan esas tonadas tan pintorescas y exóticas como en este disco. Me imagino que como Cerati ahora es el jefe, sus asesores y compañeros no se atreven a contradecirlo y pasa lo que está ocurriendo. Aunque Colores Santos y Amor Amarillo son obras maestras sin la colaboración de Zeta y Alberti. Tal vez simplemente Cerati fue demasiado grande y ahora ni siquiera él mismo logra alcanzarse.Estamos seguros que todos nosotros, sus fans, seguiremos esperando, a ver si algun día ! al fin ! vuelve Cerati con sus obras maestras."
1,My2Cents,"Please do not waste your time on this book. This book is a mish mash of topics ranging from requirements gathering to managing projects with use cases thrown in between. If you are newbie, this book is not for you. It does not teach you either UML or how to apply use cases. Martin Fowler's ""UML Distilled"" is better than this book in many aspects"
2,Buy a Sporn collar,After reading all these reviews and not wanting to hurt my dog I bought a Sporn Mesh Control Callar. It worked instantly and the dog loved it. I didn't have to get her used to it and it didn't bother her at all. Now instead of jerking my arm out of socket she walks great.
4,Works great!,"It works great, but it's quite unconfortable for my dog, he doesn't like it very much. So we switched to the easy walk harness wich is awsome!"
3,this was a recommended item,Both my dogs pull hard and so this was recommended to help. It helps a little bit but we probably need to attend obedience school too. I am sure if you have a small dog its not a problem but mine are both near 100 pounds.
4,Not Bad,"I tried this type of collar when my dog was younger and he kept managing to chew it off. Even if I only left it on him for a few minuets after coming home. It has been working a little bit better this time around. He doesn't like it very much, but he pulls so much on a choke collar that he sometime starts coughing because he can't breath very well. It is also difficult to walk him when he is pulling so much. He pulls much less with this collar. He also had a lot of chafing issues with a harness. This is a good option to try if you are having trouble with leash walking. One drawback is that your dog may stop and brush their paws over their nose to get it off."
4,Very pleased,"I looked at this same exact product elsewhere and it was 3x the price. I was happy to find it here and for a reasonable price considering the simplicity of it, and it's the best thing I've used so far on my pit bull. It's exactly her size and she's not very big, maybe 50lbs but the Medium said up to 60lbs. I'm keeping it because it seems fit the way it should but I definitely recommend going up a size if you're not sure, just because it can be adjusted."
3,Well...,"I think it's a good product... just didn't work for my dog. But, my dog is rather unique in that he goes insane outdoors when he sees another dog. So, not to say this product is bad. Just doesn't work with stubborn dogs like mine."
3,Not the best solution for all dogs,"This is not a negative review. I think the Gentle Leader may be a great solution for many dogs. But I want to share a warning to keep a close watch on the impact to your dog's personality. I tried Gentle Leader on a shelter dog that was pulling on his leash and lunging at other dogs. It did help with his training to not pull on the leash. However, it created a high level of frustration and fear that more than offset the benefits. There is no one magic bullet for dogs with behavior problems. This is a great addition to your toolkit, but do make sure it is the right tool for your dog."
3,great product,"I have a 60 lb golden retriever. my dog likes to stop and sniff EVERYTHING during our walks and would go crazy when she sees other dogs. she would sometimes pull me across streets and often i would loose her leash because she wanted to say hello to other dogs. The gentle leader has helped put an end to this behavior. she still tugs to go sniff and pulls to see other dogs, but just a small tug back from me helps correct her behavior. i could never achieve this with her regular collar. i was starting to even get wrist pain with the traditional collar. i hope the gentle leader continues to work its charm."
3,disappointed,"We have a beagle. I read the instructions several times regarding fitting the collar. It broke the second time out (the strap over the muzzle). We almost lost our dog.:( Defective collar, I think."
5,Perfect,"Works perfectly, walks with Bella are so much easier with the Gentle Leader. She is hard to control with a regular collar and difficult to walk with around town. That has changed with this purchase."
3,Not so gentle,"It could be my dog - it could be the leader. It works to some extent. My guy is very strong and this has made an incredible difference. If walk quickly or ride a bike holding onto him with him running along side - simply MUST keep moving forward otherwise, he starts pawing at it and dragging his face along the ground. I think I may need to find one that's a little wider or something because this one does annoy him so much! He has dragged his face so hard on the ground - he's bled. As long as I keep him moving forward quickly, he's fine. But, we cannot stop to sit or he gets agitated. And, positive reinforcement with treats hasn't worked either. We'll keep practicing. Maybe over time he'll get better with it? All of this said, I think this would be a great product for most dogs."
5,9 month old Rottie puppy walks without pulling,"Love this leash... my 9 year old son can walk our dog with no pulling. its a miracle leash. I tell anyone who has a dog that pulls, that they need this leash."
5,Great Gentle Lead,"This is a great product I would definitely recommend it to those interested in a gentle lead. Has helped a huge amount with the pulling. A great training accessory. It also came with a DVD which i haven't checked out yet, but I do think this could come in handy."
3,Got it never used it,"I got this, kinda small, little cheaper than I wanted. I never ended up using it. This size was perfect for a bloodhound though."
2,Doesn't work,"I had read a lot of good things about this head collar and what it can do to reduce pulling on walks, so I decided to get one for my 97 pound lab. He's always been a terrific puller and we've never really been able to control him with just a leash and normal collar.The head collar doesn't work. My dog fights it horribly when he wears it, so much so that after a single walk the strap rubbed his mouth raw, and there was some bleeding. I stopped using it immediately. We've decided to try the Easy Walk harness (also made by Premier) instead."
5,Best Head collar,"This is the best way to stop your dog from pulling and jumping while walking. I initially used this on my Golden Retriever, who I adopted when he was 1 year, about 80lbs and without any leash walking training. There was some resistance when I tried it on for the first few times, but it became easier with time (maybe 10 times,or less), now he doesn't mind and he actually gets excited as soon as he sees it. I recently got another gentle leader, which I'm using on our new puppy (5 month Great Dane), as soon as we tried it on she stopped pulling and is walking calmly without chocking herself. Also, I can't remember if this item's description mentions a trainig cd, but it comes included in the package."
5,Excellent!,"I have a 6 month old boxer puppy. I've tried a few different methods and collars to curb the pulling during walks, but nothing works. She lovvveees people and always pulls after them. Doesn't work well when I live and walk her in an urban downtown area. At first, she hated the collar, and looked like a crazy puppy jumping and shaking her head trying to get the thing off. But after that, she seemed to have gotten used to it, and she has fallen back into normal walking patterns. Now that she ""understands"" the impact of pulling ahead, she hangs by my side for the most part. Even when I just take her outside to eliminate without the gentle leader on, she walks next to me much more calmly. So far, I am very pleased. I am hoping that this behavior change in permanent, but I will post an update later after that is determined."
5,Used with care it works great!,"The Gentle Leader is a wonderful tool to help teach your dog to heel. You must be VERY careful not to jerk the dog (or have them run to the end of the leash and get jerked back) as you could do serious damage to the dog's neck. But used properly it works instantly and it's awesome. The DVD that's included has great instructions, and if you take your time teaching the dog to want to put their nose in that loop (offering many treats and much praise) you'll find it to be no problem at all. Be sure to watch that DVD and remember that the Gentle Leader is a teaching tool, and eventually should be faded away and not used again as the dog learns the proper way to walk with you."
5,Can't say enough good things,"I bought this GL for my Italian Greyhound, who walks well but insists on having constant pressure on the leash. After a little training and conditioning to wearing the GL, he accepted it within about 30 minutes and walks well in it now. As a trainer, I recommend these frequently for dogs and owners. Is it a perfect solution? No, but it makes the training process much more bearable for the dog and the human, and I will continue to recommend the Gentle Leader."
1,Aspartame (neurotoxin) for osteoarthritis?,"The example of a man who consumed a six-pack of diet cola and his arthritis improved by the end of the football game he was watching is hard to believe. I was sick for years from consuming only a small amount of diet cola or NutraSweet in such things as Crystal Lite. When I drank the entire can of a 12 oz can of Diet Coke instead of the usual small amount, I became so ill immediately that I had to see a doctor right away."
2,Okay on a dull day,"Kino and Juana are a young indian couple. They live in poverty somewhere in Latin-America. One day, the pearl-diver Kino finds the greatest pearl in the world. The whole indian village thinks this is going to bring them all a longed wealth. But it does not go as they planned......... The morale in the book was all right, and something everyone should learn from; you'll not automatically get happy just because you become rich. But we felt we not were able to get to know the characters well enough, though they were very few to be in a novel. We do also think the enviroment were badly described. A lot of questions rose to us after we had read the whole book; was Koni good or evil? Did the pearl make the whole village greedy? and so on"
5,Great place to start,"This album contains many of the Dirty Dozens best songs, and a must have. I just saw them Live at Fletchers in Baltimore, MD. last night. Amazingly good, much recommended"
3,recommended by a friend,Haven't really gotten into the book yet. It looks like it will be very good. Easy to go thru I hope
4,A Very Good LDS Movie,"This is a very good LDS movie. It's a good movie, period. It's not quite up there with The RM or The Singles Ward, but it's close. The acting is very good and the plot is both realistic and interesting. I wish the film had a little bit more of an LDS flavor to it, but it has enough--enough that I think it's appropriate for Sundays. Overall, I think this is a very good LDS movie."
5,Enjoyable,"For Christopher Walken and Peter Coyote fans, this is pretty much guaranteed to be enjoyable. Walken still has a thoroughly compelling screen presence and owns every scene. But the entire cast is solid, the writing is tight, the cinematography and direction provide a nonstop visual oasis, and perhaps all of this tends to underscore that the screenplay itself is not deep. Far from it, the storyline is very surface but yet contains enough twists and turns that the audience is subtly reminded that people's motives, good and bad, can be very mysterious indeed."
4,"Russell Crowe, need I say more?","This is not rocket science material. It is escapism and nothing more. The two saving graces in this movie are Russell Crowe and Helen Slater. The banter between them is worth every second. They argue about humming and who the best starship captain is. I would have liked to see more character development between Slater and Crowe. The ending left a lot to be desired, but hey, one can't be too critical of any movie with Russell Crowe."
1,No Way Back,"I worked in this movie, I purchased for my son ( he is in hospital ) he asked to send him this movie....it was scratched, he could not watch it!"
4,Surprisingly good little actioner,"While clearly not big studio fare this fun little film sneaks up and takes you by surprise. Director Frank Cappello moves an interesting set of characters along in a fun and engaging way that is far above what you expect in this kind of low-budget genre piece. Cinematography is especially good and the movie has a slick and stylish look. Effects and action sequences are modest, but well done. The film never seems to take itself too seriously, which is a big plus at this level. I highly recommend this one, but I liked ""American Yakuza,"" the previous effort by this same director-producer-cameraman team even better. Check them both out."
4,Great for HTPC,"I have a HTPC (Home Theater PC) running Vista Media Center that only had analog 6-channel. The clarity was poor, and I wanted more, but I did not want to use up a PCI slot, as I only had 3 available.This device does everything I wanted. It is USB, it has optical out, and it passes standard PCM audio (wav, mp3, etc.) as well as passing through any Dolby 5.1 signal through it directly to my receiver. The drivers loaded well, and installation was simple.I took off one star, as the Windows audio control no longer can change the levels, or mute. I use my receiver for that now, but it makes me use 2 remotes instead of just using my Microsoft remote. I'm sure a driver update could fix that."
2,"Wow, this blows","I loved this little guy initially, but have had all kinds of problems since then. It doesn't like it when I surf the Internet. I start getting all kinds of static. I have to remove the device from the USB port, then reinsert it to eliminate the noise. Swearing also helps. I've also had to reinstall the drivers several times. And it simply stops working occasionally. Highly disrecommended."
4,optical = no computer noise,"My old Dell D600 has noisy, lousy sound, but would otherwise function nicely as an MP3 player. Purchased a cheap SIIG USB adapter w/o optical, and while it did reduce the noise significantly, it still had some noise when the hard drive on the laptop was accessed. This adapter still has the same artifacts as the SIIG when using the analog connection, but when using the optical, it's crystal clear. My old Dell D600 now plays noiselessly through my home receiver at 44.1khz with no drivers required on XP SP3."
5,OS X,"don't know about other users experiences - perhaps an older version of OS X causes problems, but this seems to work just fine w/ a mac mini running 10.5.3"
3,A So-So Reference Book,"Brazelton's articles, column, and television show are far more helpful than this book. It is an excellent overview of developmental milestones, but I found precious little in the way of nitty-gritty every day advice. If you've read Dr. Spock then you've read this. If not, you might find Touchpoints useful as a general behavioral guide. You must remember, though, as Brazelton seems to forget in this instance, that all children do not conform to these rules. This is at best a loose guideline."
5,Book Review,"A no nonsense text, he got across his philosphy and ideas.Without ponding it into your skull. A very skillful and articulate justice. This was on my reading list for law school."
3,"A good roundtable, but not that impressive","An interesting book in that you hear a variety of approaches on statutory interpretation. However, most of their perspectives are too long-winded and really could be reduced to a couple pages. In the end, basically the people just have to agree to disagree, since they are starting with different premises and assumptions. The historian Gordon Wood's article is probably the most interesting. Overall, although the book formulates the debate well and makes you think, it is too repetitive."
4,A Sense of Perspective,"After reading several of the reviews on here, I felt compelled to put in my two cents' worth. A number of the people that disliked these stories did so because they found the computer science in this ""dated"" -- well, of course it is, these stories are over 50 years old. Computers then were huge monsters that took up entire floors of buildings and didn't have the processing power of the PC I'm using to write this note on. No one then foresaw the coming explosion of processing power and availability of computers to the ""common man"" that would occur about 30 years down the road. So try to keep that in mind when you read these stories. It's like Jules Verne writing of going to the moon back when hot air balloons were about the only way of getting man off the ground."
3,Not Like the Movie,"I, Robot is an interesting look at the philosphy and psychology of robots, but it is not really a novel. Instead, it is a collection of lengthy vignettes, each of which deals essentially with the solving of a logic puzzle requiring humans to figure out how robot minds will interpret the 3 laws. From that standpoint, it was certainly clever. Readers expecting to get a story like the one offered by the Will Smith movie, however, will be in for a deeply unpleasant surprise."
5,Worth to read,"This is the first volume of the robot series and to get to understand the other Robot books, you have to read this. It will make it much easier to undesrstand the concept of Robot and the laws of Robotics, as well as some 'Asimov histories' ocassionally mentioned in his other Robot books. This book has bunch of short stories of robots which are all written in diffrent time and was on diffrent magazines however they all fit into the Asimove's world timeline.(Timeline in Asimov's Robot, Empire and Foundation series is quite important because they all connect together somehow) So if you wanna make a fresh new start on Asimov books, start with this book.. or other books with those robot short stories. Sometimes it's a bit confusing because there are books with diffrent titles and the same content-those books seem to be containing some new stories but they don't because Asimov wrote only about 20 stories (or little more i'm not sure) and that's all they can get since Asimov's dead(sadly)."
3,I robot,Finally found time to read it. Good book. Worth the time. Really annoying that i have to write so many words when few will do
2,i robot,i was rather disappointed. i expected it to be in better condition. the cover was stained and torn. the pages were yellowed and the book has a horrible musty odor. on the other hand the pages were all intact and the binding was good.
2,Give it a Pass,"I've read Asimov's Foundation Trilogy and enjoyed it, so I know he can do better than this. The subject matter just isn't that interesting. Perhaps in the 40's and 50's, when these stories were written, it was enough to have a robotic character to grab people's attention. But by today's standards, these stories are pretty weak, and no robot can distract from the substandard writing.Subject matter aside, the characters are even worse. Flat and unrealistic, with dialogue that sounds like it was written by a 7th grader, I found myself hating many of them not because that was the author's intent, but simply because I couldn't stomach the cheesy things they said!All in all, I would recommend that you pass on this one, unless you're just curious to see what passed for science fiction in the early days."
1,Not so good...,"I read the book after seeing the movie, and I was very disappointed. I expect a little variation between the two, usually the books have more detail, and some detail about the robots would have been interesting. But I have no idea where they got the idea for the movie from this book. Will Smith's character is not even in the book. The only similarities were the three laws, and Dr. Calvin. If you liked the movie, I would not even read the book."
2,"Unfortunately, a disappointment","I've read Asimov's later robot novels, which were quite good, so I expected much more from this book, which is considered a classic. There is no true variety of stories within; each basically deals with an off-kilter robot and humans trying to solve the problem. The humans, however, are the main focus of each story, and Asimov doesn't do a very good job with them. They're always arguing and insulting each other, calling the other ""fool"", ""child"", and such. What a bunch of boors. And I'm supposed to be interested in these characters? By the end of the book, I wished that the robots had killed all these annoying humans so I wouldn't have to read their cheesy melodramatic dialogue. But, darnit, that First Law always gets in the way..."
4,the robots are trying to control us,In the future in the year 2058 A.D. we have robots to do different things for use like house hold chores and stuff. There are three laws of robotics that robots have to follow. The first is that a robot may not injure a human being or let human being come to harm The second law is that a robot must follow orders given by a human being unless it interferes with the first law. The third law is that a robot must protect its own existence unless it interferes with the first or second law. But in this book the robots that they are talking about are starting to break these laws. It is up to some brave scientist to take theses robots down.This book is good for people who like robots and the future. The only dislike I had was that they changed characters in the book sometimes but other than that it is good. If you just want to get the movie to say you read the book you might get an F because the book is nothing like the movies except for the laws of robotics.
5,From the Father of Robotics,"I must first say, that dipite its cover, this book has hardly any correlation to the movie I Robot, which seems closer to Caves of Steel. That said, I think This book rocks! I read it before the movie existed, so I had no assumptions. By the wave, it has nothing to do with the movie, other than the ""Three Laws"". I Robot is brilliantly plotted in its psychological twists, and has a lot of humor and comedy in it too. A great collection of stories, that do not have to be read in order, but it helps a lot if you do."
4,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book and recommend it for those interested in the evolution of science fiction. There's a distinct quaint flavor to scifi from around this time, the 40s, with the idealistic hopes of the era giving its fiction a positive, optimistic resonance. There are many laugh-out-loud moments in this book at the eccentricities of the robot characters, as well as some quirky reflections of human kind. It may not be for everyone, for those who like sagas of high drama and tension, but if you're after some thought provoking fun, this is a good place to find it."
2,"Good Idea, Bad writing","Basically this book is about stupid people acting stupidly. The characters are incredibly unrealistic. The main character of the book, Calvin, is more annoying then anything else. I was also extremely disappointed with the endings of most of these stories. It seemed almost like these people in the book tried to make trouble for themselves. There are many good ideas in this book but it is poorly executed. Not Asimov's best."
2,"""I,Robot"" A Dislikeable Book","I thought this book was very boring.This was not a good book for a 7th grader.You know how in all books the author builds up the suspanse and then it gets good.In this book it just keeps building up and up and up till the book ends.Now I haven't read the other books in the series but after reading this book I don't think i want too.I,Robot had no action at all.I know there are some people that like books like this but I prefer to have a little action.If i were going to recommend a book I personly would have this book on the bottom of my recommendation list."
2,Nerds go crazy!!,"I was thinking this book would be awesome seeing the movie previews and all, but this book was a bit of a let down.It's more like a bunch of stories that are loosely connected by something like an interview or something.The series might pick up in the other books, but I, Robot is kinda boring, so why would you want tobuy the others? Of course!You're some kind of nerd!The stories in I, Robot are boring andstart to get repeatative. Super robot gets invented,people who made robot screw up,robot goes crazy and threatens humanity. That sounds almost exciting, right? No, the robot harms no one, no bloodshed, no gore, plain clean boredom. If I had seen the movie, my expectations may have been higher, therefore my score would most likely be lowered. So, after reading this, if you still want to by it, you either want it to go to sleep, or you're a nerd."
3,I reccomend it to nerds.,"This bored me. I didn't see what's so intriguing about this. Asimov doesn't bring up any interesting points or anything about anything. Just a bunch of boring computer jive which is probably dated now anyways. The famed three laws of robots was pretty standard issue. Not much out of the ordinary here. Any robot philosophy this book has you probably already know. There's not an ounce of style here, and there's a lot of cheese. The people characters have less personality than the machines. Perhaps I'm just being harsh because it wasn't for me. I didn't like it. The imagery described was surprisingly wonderful though. And I feel compelled to give this book an extra star for some strange supernatural reason."
3,Dissapointing,"This book is a collection of short stories about robots. They are put in order from the first robots to the more complex ones. However, the plots and the stories mainly center in people trying to fix glitches based on the first three robotic laws. The robots themselves, act like humans on one side, on the other side, have characteristics that can't compare with computers today, for example, a robot called ""The Brain"" took 17 days in feeding the information from like 50 encyclopedias, thing that with today's technology takes about 2 minutes. All in all, I found Asimov's notions and assumptions about robotics, quite outdated."
1,"What's that I smell? It's the garbage that is I, Robot.","OK, for the life of me, I cannot understand how Asimov has come to be revered as a great of science fiction. The dialog in this book is so overly simplistic one would think it's targeted for a grade school student. (Hmmm...On second thought, that's an insult to all grade-schoolers out there.) Characters are predictably dramatic, and the plots (yes, plots...this is a series of short stories, not a novel) definitely cross the line (and make leaps and bounds into the land) of ludicrousness. Case in point: The robot that reads minds, and has a conversation with a roboticist about the fact that she's in love with another roboticist. (Are you serious here, Izzy?!!!)In short, don't buy this garbage. Opt for any of Arthur C. Clarke's books instead. (Childhood's End, for example, would be an excellent alternative.)"
3,HOW ODD That It got some very low marks,"I do not have the book, nor have I read it, but oddly enough, it is the beginning Greek book used at Rice University, which is a brainy school. Perhaps it was written for high level teachers and students -no knocks intended, just an observation. I had thought about getting to try and do some self-learning; however; I now am having second thoughts. Perhaps I would need a uber instructor in order to get the full benefit of the book."
4,Wide Variety of Tales of Travelers,"From Jack Kerouac's bopping, stream-of-consciousness short story, Big Trip to Europe, to Anthony Trollope's tragic morality tale, A Ride Across Palestine, this collection has (excuse the cliché) something for everyone. All the stories herein were chosen for their examination of the traveler, and the variety is excellent.There are tales set in France, India, Prague, and the Scottish Isles. Some involve physical challenge, most are about social and psychological challenges faced by the traveler. Anita Desai, Flannery O'Connor, John Cheever, and Charles Dickens penned entries. I didn't find a single story that wasn't worth reading. At a full 33 stories, even the most discerning reader would not find much disappointment.It is a very entertaining book to have along on a journey, although any reader / traveler who packs light ought to know that the paperback version is a full inch thick and significantly heavier than, say, an average Penguin paperback!"
1,R.Marsh Anatomy for Artists,"This book contains sloppy drawings of other people's work. I have found it the poorest source for information about drawing. Since I have reproductions of many major artists, Marsh's copys are a real disappointment. Also I have had students discouraged by this book. It may have been valuable in the 40s when other sources were unavailable, but now there is little value here."
2,Not up to Black & Decker standards...,"We previously owned a Black & Decker standard glass carafe coffee maker, and were extremely pleased with it. We then went through a Gevalia branded thermal carafe drip coffee machine, and loved it. When it finally quit working, we purchased this machine, and have been very disappointed. It's cheaply made, and the carafe leaks. We are constantly having to mop up drips and the carafe doesn't pour well. It makes ""okay"" coffee, but this product is definitely NOT up to Black & Decker standards. If you want a good drill or saw, get a Black & Decker. If you want a good coffee maker, get another brand!"
1,Do Not Buy,Carfe didn't keep coffee warm and it leaked. Miramar mfr. nicely sent replacement! Good customer service. Unfortunatly now it doesn't brew at all. Purchased for christmas gift. So it lasted total maybe a few weeks
2,Description is misleading,"I thought this would be a book with text, with a history of the prom, the timeline, and some anecdotes. There is very little text, and it is mostly photos of couples. It's a nice blast from the past, but it should be labeled as a book of photos. The text is negligible, and doesn't add much to the book. If you want to look at old prom photos, get the book, but if you want to read funny stories or about the history of the prom, this is not the book to get."
1,Waste of Hard Earned Money,"Purchased this book for my niece. She'll be attending her senior prom in the next fews weeks, I thought this would be a'cute' little book for her. To my surprise, the entire bookis photos of individuals in their prom 'outfits'.If I wanted my niece to 'see' individuals in their prom 'outfits', I'd had sooner give her her grandmother,mother's and great aunts senior albums."
4,Very Useful for intermediate and more experienced Techs.,"It's not really a book for new techs unless they have someone on hand to explain the smaller details. Very informative for all kinds of clinical lab testing, sample selecting and preparing. Starts with hematology and goes on through urinalysis, oncology, and more. My DVM is very pleased with our lab personel's newfound knowledge since we purchased this book."
3,Good basic info,Good basic info but doesn't go into enough details to be useful past your first semester in school. And even then you will be referencing other books as this book is simply too basic.
2,Its ok but get The Who's Doubble cd and Hendrix's cd,This CD is ok but you are better off getting The Who's cd and Hendrix's cd. It is a good cd if you want to get a mix of what was at the fest.
3,Plodding story,"I went back to read the Second Chronicles so that I could make better sense of the Last Chronicles. In particular, you have to read this book, and it's really annoying that it isn't available in Kindle format. It's the first paper book I've purchased in about 6 years. Rereading this book answered a lot f questions for me, but it was a slog to get through it. Too much of the story is spent examining Linden and Covenant's angst rather than progressing the story line. Even so, Donaldson didn't develop a lot of other characters. I was surprised that didn't even name so many giants and Haruchai. It's my least favorite of the series. It's even more morose than ""Against All Things Ending"""
5,Will watch it at the film club on Monday,"It was great delivery speed, great packaging, and great shapeIt is one of the remaining movies we need to finish up our John Wayne film club!!!"
4,"Ok for Indian flute music, but I've heard better","All of R. Carlos Nakai's albums sound very similar. If you own one album already, then this won't take you by surprise. You'll recognize the rhythms and sounds right away."
3,engaging but graphic,"""Stolen"" continues the story of Elena Michaels, a young woman turned werewolf, where the book, ""Bitten"" left off. The relationships between Elena and her pack, especially Clay are just as real and engaging as in the former book. Ms. Armstrong shows an amazing gift in painting life as it would be as a half human/half werewolf with incredible depth and understanding. The downside in this book is the inordinate amount and graphic nature of the violence. It's not the generic ""they killed the man"" type or even the ""they blew up the building with everyone in it"" type. It is the personal description of each kill with graphic imagery used repeatedly with relish that just isn't this reader's cup of tea."
1,To bad you can't give a book 0 Stars,Bad plotBad characterizationLazy writingunbelievable storylineI felt cheated and really wanted to return the book for a refund. This is the last book that I will purchase from Kelly Armstrong.
3,Not the greatest sequel,"I loved Bitten, and read it in one day!! I am having the hardest time getting into Stolen. The characters seem to lack the development and depth that was prevalent in Bitten. But I find it worth reading because I want to know what happens with Elena and Clay and the rest of the pack."
3,Too Small For Old Eyes,We are sixty-plus and it was too small for our eyes and fingers. I returned it and never received a credit.
4,"Proofreading and Dictation Improving As We Speak--No, Read","Here's a book with thirty weeks of drills for students to practice and develop proofreading and dictation skills. The first three days contain proofreading drills in the form of a paragraph, ideal for duplication onto an overhead, and the fourth day is a dictation drill designed to build listening skills. Skills emphasized are spelling, mechanics, and grammar."
3,An Ok Raw Book if You Already Have The Better Ones,"I think this is an ok addition to a kitchen library, but DEFINITELY not the best. Some of the recipes are a bit complicated, but they are pretty good. The simpler ones are quite nice. I suggest buying this book if you are interested in advanced recipes and lots of personal stories about the authors lives (appealing more to voyeurs than cooks or raw foodists).If you have to choose a book, I recommendLiving Cuisine: The Art and Spirit of Raw Foods (Avery Health Guides)first and maybe this one as an afterthought. Living Cuisine is a better book in so many ways. Living Cuisine has excellent raw recipes. BUT the author includes the most impressive info on foods, flavors, and techniques, making this a choice book for ANY food lover, raw or not.Edit:I'd like to add a star and one more comment for this book. Their recipes for deserts and drinks are some of the best I've found. Delicious."
3,If I only owned a raw food restaurant ...,"then I'd be able to make and eat all this fabulous food!I did like this book very much, but for the average working person, most of the recipies seem too complicated. I did enjoy reading the book and the photo's are beautiful.I did try the Cinnamon Banana Shake pg 83 (using Pacific Almond Milk though) and it was a very delicious shake! I do hope to try a few of the easier recipies in the future."
3,Gorgeous book I NEVER use...,"So, as many have noted, this book is really pretty. I love to look at the recipes and photos - the food appears really interesting and is probably delicious. I wouldn't know, because I've never made a single one. The vast majority of recipes in this book are so time-consuming, and often have ingredients that are difficult or impossible to find where I live (and yeah, we have a natural foods store). I'm a mom of 4 and eat probably 75% raw, but I just don't have time to make most of the stuff in here. If you're really into ""gourmet raw"" and have lots of time on your hands or have parties where you want to impress friends with cool raw recipes, this book is for you. But it's just ridiculous for this book to be titled ""Raw Food/Real World."" Not sure what world the authors live in...I guess since they run a raw restaurant, they have plenty of time to prepare these recipes.Oh, and yeah, the self-obsession of the authors is pretty weird too."
5,I've Bought 4 Copies in the last 2 weeks!,"I became a raw foodie after spending 1 hour with this book! No other book has transformed my thinking as quickly as this one. The Spicy Thai Vege Wraps were wonderful and I love NOT COOKING anymore! I would rate the book 6 stars, but I took a star away because I couldn't find a serving count on any of the recipes. In spite of that, I'm buying copies for all my friends!"
5,Love this!,"I made a few of the recipes and they were so, so good. I love the presentation of the book and how things are written. Good job! I feel like I can relate to the authors which is a huge plus."
4,Great Food but a Little Time Consuming,"This is probably my favorite raw book. It really helps that they have such amazing pictures of the food. It inspires you to try the recipes. Sometimes I'm turned off by recipes in raw food books because the recipes seem unusual or don't sound good. The pictures overcome that. Everything I've tried has tasted great (favorites being the Thai Veggie Wraps and the Yellow Squash Linguine with Tomatoes and Mushrooms), but the recipes take quite a bit of time to get together. Since I work and do almost all the cooking in my family I try to save these recipes for the weekend when I have more time."
5,BEST RAW FOOD COOKBOOK YET,"Hello folks, I have many raw food cookbooks, each with their share of good and bad recipes - but this one takes the cake! Matthew and Sarma have created a cookbook that is totally innovative and stands alone when compared to the rest of the raw recipe books out there. Having gone raw for a year now, I was busting at the seams, because I was becoming bored with many of my recipes. This book has enough new treats and entrees that will be my favorites for a life time!Wait until you try their Banana Chocolate Shake, Almond Tart, and Tacos!"
2,Raw Food for the Rich World,"If you have an unlimited budget and time, this book is for you. If you have access to, or like ordering specialty items, then rejoice, for you have found the right raw food book. If you LOVE coconut, and don't mind that the average recipe calls for 6 or 7 to be chopped open on your countertop with a machete (at $2 per coconut), then you have found paradise. I'm sure that all of the recipes taste wonderful, but I'm likely never to know. I did enjoy the read but this book will probably collect dust from here forward. I've never met a book so ineptly named. I'm guessing the chefs have never lived in the ""real world"", or were paid an average salary either!!!"
2,disappointing,"This book has great photos in it and comes across as hands-on and informed. However, almost all recipes rely on coconut or large amounts of nuts as a basic ingredient. This is basically a raw-vegan-coconut/nut-cookbook."
1,What?!,Seriously? Seriously people enjoyed this? Apparently my standards are really too high because besides the god awful acting and accents it really did not do the characters of nora roberts' book justice. a decent book turned into a waste of time movie. i couldn't even stand to watch it through.
3,It was okay,This was a great movie! But I had to wait a while to receive it! If you are looking for a romantic suspense this is the DVD for you I would just pay for the fast shipping or you will be waiting a while!!
3,rc tug boat,"this is a ok rc tug boat, but don't try to make upgrades, it to hard to get all the wires and if your not careful you well break one, so i say just leave the boat stock, and just enjoyed it that way."
2,Lost focus in the story and stagnated.,"A look into the past of Grey, one of the side characters in the Adept series. Back we go to WWII. Grey is a member of a coven that is attempting to stop Hitler from invading. Could have been exellent but then she bogged down in too many of the details involving the convincing of the covens to help. The story line became strained, tedious and boring. It was a pale shadow of the adept series and a disappointment."
2,"Great product ,Bad delivery!","What I recieved of the product was outstanding. Unfortunatly it was missing disc 3 of 5 disc.that kinda took away from the total experience of it.But mistakes do happend and when I reported it , I was refunded in full. So all ended well...I just wish I could have gotten that 3rd disc instead of the money!"
1,"Communion with God by Neale Donald Walsch, audio-book","I have read all the books by Walsch and love them. This last one I wanted to listen to on audio-cd, read by three different readers. The content is superb, as usual, but I was very disapointed about the style of one of the readers (not Walsch himself, which is one of the readers). He has a very deep voice like those commercial-readers on TV and he talks in a very intense and dramatizing fashion. I guess he is trying to sound like god himself, but the result is just irritating. Please do not use commercial-readers for future audio-books. I also love to listen to Deepak Chopra. He could set the example on how to read in a more soft and neutral way which pays respect to the content."
2,Case Not Up To Expectations,"I purchased this case not realizing that the large metal zipper terminated inside the case where it could inevitably mar the finish on both the butt-stock as well as the muzzle of the firearm. Another problem I encountered was the zipper pull came off one end. I contacted Plano and several emails later they instructed me to return the case to the factory where they replaced it with another case of equal or greater value. The case I received in return has a plastic zipper vs. the metal one on the original case, which I surmised would be far more durable. I must admit that there is FAR less chance it will beat up my firearm, I just am not sure how long the plastic zipper will endure. I must admit, although I was less than satisfied with my original purchase, Plano DID make every effort to make it right in a timely manner and make me a ""Happy Camper""!Kudos Plano!"
2,Dreadful ....,"The author states he is giving his previous principal character a rest. That is understandable, however disappointing. But that is no excuse for this combination of overworked plot(serial killing, early rape, police technique,etc.) Florida locations and characters, and descriptions of passion barely worthy of Harlequin. Every now and then a brilliant description, phrasing, or emotion comes by -- but not so often as to lift the piece to Hall's standards. Fortunately, borrowed from the library -- and no personal funds wasted."
3,Not up to par,"Read Under Cover of Daylight, Buzz Cut or Mean High Tide if you want a good book by this author. This one has some great possibilities, but it just doesn't quite live up to those. Situations were too contrived and obvious. Check it out of the library and you will get your money's worth. :-)"
2,Reeks of chemicals....,"Yes, I know it is chemicals that create the grape flavoring but this smelled like cheap grape bathroom cleanser and had a lot of oiliness that doesn't work well in my lollipops."
2,What?,"Well written collection of remembrances, tall tales, and fantasies. But they fail to come together as a book, let alone what most would consider a ""novel"". He needs a new editor to stop him navel gazing (falling in love with himself)."
3,What was Yugoslavia like before the recent wars?,"I agree that this is an enjoyable page turner but not cohesive as a novel.That aside, the third section is a great portrayal of life inside a Communist society. The account of Pronek's adolescent adds to my understanding about life in Tito's Yugoslavia. What a surprise, life in a communist country, especially Yugoslavia, was neither horrible, nor wonderful. Hemon's anecdotes are the antidote to anti-Communist hysteria present even today in America."
5,Superb Pastiche,"A writer that actually has Holmes deducing! Many of the more modern attempts at copying the style of the originals go for shallow action tales, with very little detective work by Holmes. Boyer brings the quality of Doyle himself to this excellent work. A fast moving story, an intelligent Holmes, and a true, good ol' faithful Watson - Boyer gets it all spot on. Well done, Sir!"
4,A good prequel that answered questions for me. Very satisfying.,I really enjoy seeing how people got to the point where The Wheel of Time begins. It also gives more depth to the character's motivations. I loved it.
1,Somebody please stop him!!!!!,"Wheel of Time started off with such promise. I read the first 8 of the series, and it gradually lost its way. After finishing ""Path of Daggers"", I realized that absolutely nothing had happened over the course of several hundred pages. Oh wait-women adjusted their skirts a few hundred times and talked about how ""wool-headed"" men are, and Rand had about 500 conversations with his inner, psychotic split personality. We also heard about how when he uses the power it feels ""tainted"", blah blah blah.This series would've been great if it had ended after 5-6 books. Now it's just going nowhere as Jordan milks the cash cow for all it's worth. Why do we need a prequel when he hasn't even finished the original story? George R.R. Martin's ""Song of Ice and Fire"" blows this out of the water."
3,eh!,It was enjoyable to revisit these fabulous characters and of course I want more. There beginnings are OK but I have read them all without this knowledge and that is part of the mystery of who they are.worth reading!
5,My review,"I love a good story that takes me away from the rigors of this world and introduces me to a set of excellent characters and vivid settings. The Wheel of Time series is just this. And much like life, there are some parts/books in the series that move slower than others, but they continue to build the depth of the characters while introducing new ones. I have thoroughly enjoyed this book of the series as it starts to tie things together and builds to the final book."
1,Waste of Time,"When my wife told me that another book was just released I was in suspense and eager to get my hands on it.For those of you who've read the last couple of books in the series, this will seem like an entire year wasted on a book that could have been written after the series was finished.The male source is finally clean. And while we're salivating for the final battle to commence, he writes a story about Novices going on an adventure.Thoroughly disgusted, I cannot bear to read any more of his books until he gets his act together and stops writing about snotty Novices, Accepted and power junkie Aes Sedai scheming and whining about how every single nit picking detail is or should be done in, around or for the White Tower."
4,Enough of the 1 star reviews!,"Most of the 1 star reviews appear to be written by people who haven't read the book. This is not simply a reprint of the original short story.The first 202 pages (of a 334 page book) are brand new, and the rest has been rewritten, in some places just a tweak here and there, and in others a more significant rewrite.Even though this does not advance the main story forward, it is a much more interesting read than Crossroads of Twilight (the last full-length novel), and it provides a nice chunk of information about an important aspect of the Wheel of Time narrative--just how and why did Moiraine begin hunting for the Dragon Reborn.It's important to note that the rewrite of New Spring truly does add to the original short story, and gives us additional insight not available in the original story."
1,What a waste of paper pulp,"This book is a flimsy attempt at continuing RJ's one story career. Running out of delaying tactics, and facing the realization that the story must now be drawn to a close, Jordan stoops to writing a 'prequel'; delaying for yet another year the conclusion of what was once a great story. Its dull and adds very little to the story-that-will-never-die. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK - WAIT UNTIL IT HITS THE USED BOOK STORE. Its only worth the dollar you'll be charged for it there."
4,"RJ haters, shut your mouths.","I'm really tired of reading reviews about how Robert Jordan should end the WOT series already, and it's all the same, blah blah blah. If you don't like it, stop reading it already. It's a long story with more than just battles and magic. If you want that, go read some Dungeons and Dragons novel.As for this book, good stuff. Shows us some more background. If you love WOT then I have no doubt that you will love this."
3,A bit tired of the whole thing,I bought this not so much because I wanted it but that I hate having an incomplete series on my bookshelf. I waded through it and found some elements to be worthwhile. But overall I would have been much more satisfied with a conclusion to the whole thing rather than more of a beginning.It seems of late that many authors are writing to churn out books rather than to entertain. Some still do a good job such as R. A. Salvatore for instance.A true to form book of the Wheel of Time but not nearly the caliber of the earlier books of the series.
1,Stop it!!,"Mr. Jordan, please stop writing the Wheel of Time! Its about time you rest and let us rest. Your novels are getting more and more boring, repetitive, totally absurd and without any interest. You have milked every drop of what was a wonderful series for the first three books. After that.....well, one has to be a masoquist to keep reading you."
1,WHAT THE HECK? A PREQUEL!!!!!!,"What does RJ think he's doing? The WOT series hasn't even finished yet. And he writes a prequel! RJ has become greedy, milking this cash cow for all its worth. Don't buy this book. Perhaps then he will get back on track with the actual series."
4,At least it was better than book 10!,"I know that this book isn't what everyone was hoping for (finally a conclusion to this series, and a book where something actually HAPPENS), but at least it's better than book 10. I hadn't read Legends, so it was new to me, and I enjoyed this little book. I agree that RJ clearly has terrible writer's block, but maybe this will help put him back on track to finish the series. I certainly hope so, because I'm pretty sick of forking over my money to him."
3,New Spring (A Wheel of Time Prequel Novel),This is a fair review of a small portion of the series. I would have liked to have seen new material introduced. A new reader of the series may not want to choose this as the starting point.
3,Prologue to the prequel of the Wheel of Time?,"I'm currently re-reading the series before Book 13 is released, and came away with mixed reviews of this book. Clearly, Jordan intended this to be 1 of 3 prequel books to the main Wheel sequence. It just seems that the main objective-finding the newly born Dragon Reborn-feel off to the wayside about 1/3 of the way through the book. The end of the book seemed to have become centered on political intrigue within Kandor, with weak connections to the main objective.Having said that though, I enjoyed seeing some of the early background on Moiraine, Siuan and Lan. A little more of Lan would have been nice, but as others have pointed out this is Moiraine's story."
5,Wheel of time,"I liked the book, only thing is I did not know about it until I was almost at the end of the series. It was a good read and completed some of the things I wondered about as I read the other books.I wish Amazon could list books that are in a series in order, it would make following the series easier."
3,"people, pay attention","Mr Robert Jordan has passed away, so please forgive him for dragging his feet! he suffered from cancer, so it is understandable how he had slipped into taking his own sweet time in writing his last few books. furthermore, his wife (who had been his editor for years) has taken on the job of piecing together RJ's notes and will be writing the final book in the series. I hope that this helps........"
2,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Im sorry.I think that Ann Martin can do a better job. This Book was BORING, i practicly fell asleep. Dont waste your money, i was very disapointed with this book."
2,don't over estimate this book,"This book isn't for medical students, isn't for nursing student but should be good for a high school student wanting to learn about pathology."
1,This company totally sucks,"DO NOT BUY THIS COMPANY. MAN NO BATTERY, NO CHARGER, NO PLACE TO BUY. VERY EXPENSIVE."
3,OK but not great!,The cover is soft and the size is really great. It heats up slowly and does not get hot enough.
2,"""warming"" pad is more accurate","Doesn't get hot enough for me. I want enough heat to penetrate into the tight muscles, but this one won't do it. The hottest setting is just warm to me. My wife likes it though. Maybe it's good for skinny people. The 9 ft. long cord is nice."
4,It works,"As with most things that need to be replace because they break, I wish we had the old one. This one does the job, it is a heating pad. Didn't like the cover and made a new one."
4,Helpful,"Very helpful in scheduling out Henle Latin 1 at a couple of different speeds. Not flashy-looking, but gets the job done."
2,A tough read,This book is way too technical for the lay person. As a physical therapist I have found a majority of my patients commenting on how hard it is to understand. The book has good intentions however it is not an easy read.
3,Treat Your Own Back,"It possibly can work for others but the discomfort I felt from doing the initial set of excercises while tolerable was not encouraging. Further, the book indicates that if the pain does not subside after the first set of exercises one should discontine. I assume it works for some but not all people."
1,Poor construction,I bought 10 of these for my Physical Education classes. I have taught Phys Ed for 20 plus years and have seen balls last as long as two years. These lasted between 1-2 days at my middle school. Most would not hold air. Those that did would pop within 3-5 hours play.
2,Cheap is cheap.,"This is like a smooth playground ball - not the typical raised patches of a soccer ball. It doesn't hold air for more than a week or two - we have go add air before practice each week. That said, our young (4 and 6) kids loved it. It does the job and is nice to not worry about losing it, or if you're not ready to invest in pricier balls, its ok."
1,Seller did not discribe the condition of the product,"I was lead to believe that the ball would come looking like the picture, they did not state that it would not come inflated. So now I have to go and buy a pump to inflate the ball. Thanks alot for making me waste my time and money, so close to christmas. I should have gone to Walmart I would have paid less buying an inflated ball instead of buying a ball and a pump."
2,Very skimpy,"This book is a skeleton summary of the basic concepts. The author does not go into depth on any particular design-related topic. IMHO, the title is misleading. If I was naming this book, I would call something like ""Brief Introduction to PSoC Architecture and Development Tools"". As another reviewer mentioned, all information in this book can be found on the Cypress website and in the PSoC Designer help index as well as user module datasheets. There is almost no tips, tricks or examples to help a designer such as myself that understands the basics. I'd say the only thing that this book could be good for is to help make a quick decision whether to use a PSoC for a particular project or not. Once you've decided to go with PSoC and you actually have to make it work, you are better off reading the datasheets, application notes and technical reference manuals because this book is more of a 'getting started with PSoC' rather than a 'designer's guide'."
4,college book,"it was a great price for the book, helped me though the class, very interesting to read would recommend it"
3,Okay but poor quality,"Well, I don't expect a great quality for this price, but I have to say that it's a shame to make a national flag into this poor quality, especially it is made in China.Really thin, NOT for outdoor or it'll be ruin by the wind within a week.Fast shipping, though! And it's good for indoor use.PS: I bought a Republic of China (Taiwan) flag for $5. Comparing with this $4 flag, it is much more stronger and thicker.That flag is made in Taiwan, I think the Chinese manufacturers should have a better quality of manufacturing their OWN national flags."
1,Disappointed,"The book struck me as silly and it bored my 4-year old, who generally finds something of interest even in news articles! It is also overtly Christian, so if you don't want to send a message about Christian God, it's not appropriate. I returned it."
3,Too Stereotyped,"I am a psychologist and bought all 3 books in the series when my son's wife gave birth to his 3rd child. I didn't preview it before I read these books to the oldest as well as to newly deemed ""middle child."" I was disapointed and a bit apologetic to their parents when we all read it together. These children knew the message(s) in the book were related to them. I felt that since they are so young, they were getting a message about how they were going to (or should) turn out. Also, there were references to Christmas and I felt this didn't leave room for people who celebrate other holidays than those. I thought the concept of the book was good. From the title, I was mainly interested in the message that the mother loves all three of her children, recognises differences, but loves them just the same. I wish the author would have just adhered to that theme and left the predictions about their personalities and behavior out of it. [...]"
4,Join the Spirit,"This is an interesting mix of Music. It plays well in listening through the CD. The album is full of interesting songs, and sediments. It is so interesting to listen to in comparison to groups that never seem to vary their song styles."
3,Quality material bad zippers...,I am wearing these pants in Afghanistan where I am working and they are great as far as material durability and just overall comfort. The only problem with this product is the poor quality zipper. The zipper for this product is of very poor quality and I have had to replace every single one. If the zipper doesn't out right bust the teeth are breaking off one by one
3,BAD GRAMMAR!,"Yes, yes, it's very pretty. However, the poor grammar is driving me wild. I can't even look at the darned thing without having a small fit of grammatical outrage.It should read: ""Grow old with me. The best is yet to be.""At the very least the two statements should be on separate lines.NEVER buy this for a writer, English teacher, or editor. You will drive them insane."
3,Mercury Bubbles Come Blasting In,"Hey, all you Sailor Moonies! This book is pretty good compared to the last two--actually, it's great compared to them! Lianne Sentar writes stories much better than Stuart Levy. For all you Mercury fans, this is a must-buy! The more books you have, the better! ^-^ I, for one, have 9 SM books, not including my role-playing game book, so I know what's good and what's not. And this is a pretty good book! Well, i'm outie!~Princess Usagi"
5,Vivid!,"Although this book was recquired reading for a Roman History class I took, I found myself really enjoying the read. Shelton does a superb job in collecting sources to paint an engaging and colorful picture of Roman society. I've read a lot of books about Roman history(due to the sweetness of its action), but few make the Romans seem to come alive quite like this one. If you like Roman history like me, this would be an excellent choice for your collection."
5,good reference for students,"Students may not always like reading the primary sources, but the organization of this collection makes it easy to assign relevant text and skip the unnecessary materials. A good why to expose the class to the ancient's view of themselves without overwhelming them with reading. Best if used in conjunction with a good solid historical explaination of Roman life and history."
5,Satisfied customer,I was happy withn the fast service and the condition of the dvd. I am looking forward to doing business with you again.
3,More Detail Please,"Basically this book is the Cliff notes of the book Barbarians at the Gate. The book covers the management buy out of RJR and all the financial moves that took place to get it done. It covers the winners and losers and the tactics they used. It also does an adequate job of describing all of the plays involved. It is a good enough little book, some good details and the witting is not bad. If you really want all the details read the book Barbarians at the gate, it is a much more detailed and exciting book; the extra pages and detail do not slow it down at all."
2,cowboys49,"I'm so used to their Native American music, that this was a little too ""woo woo"" for me. I gave it to my friend who's a massage therapist. She liked it, but I didn't."
4,A murder mystery with great wigs!,"This is the movie that brought Greenaway to the world stage...... it's the intriguing story of a man who's persuaded, against his better judgment, to make some drawings of a country estate - unaware that he's being used as a pawn in a vicious plot involving several co-conspirators.The visuals are stylish (perhaps even over stylized), and the dialogue demands the viewer's attention at every turn: but it's a movie worth watching more than once because of its ambiguities.I first saw this film in 1984, and even today I'm not convinced that I've solved all of its mysteries."
4,A DVD delight for the senses,"Greenaway is in fine form in this early film, oh so clever in construction. A bold, crackling delight for the eye, ear and mind. I only saw it once, in an art house theatre, and the experience in DVD on a good widescreen TV will be the best viewing this film will ever have for most.How surprising for this unusual film to make it to DVD in front of thousands of others. It must have been someone's favorite. Good show!"
1,had to give it a star to review it,"one word:garbagebut if that doesn't help here are a few more words:this book is full of cheesy cliché, poor metaphor, and useless filler. not to mention technical jargon that does nothing for the storyline. i picked it up because i figured it had to be a best seller for a good reason. save your time and money. the surprise ending is not much of a surprise at all. the characters are flat and his attempt at spicing them up are quite unsuccessful. i'm really shocked that this author has achieved such a level of commercial success.if you want to read a good mystery that takes place on the high seas i recommend ""Star of the Sea"" by Joseph O'Connor."
2,Not what I'd hoped,"I wanted to like this book. I wanted to LOVE this book, I truly did. I'm the daughter of a Naval officer, I'm a scuba diver, I love a good mystery and I'm a Maltese Falcon fan..... But I just didn't connect with this book. I'm not sure why. Maybe reading the English translation put a wall up between me and the characters? Maybe the emphasis on the 'love' story over the mystery (and I didn't really buy the love story, either)? Whatever it was, I was disappointed with this book. I would have rather there was a lot more emphasis on the actual sea search and diving, that was very interesting, and the mystery line and double cross, rather than Coy's emotional chaos. And Palermo drove me insane, I couldn't even read any of his dialog, it was that annoying. And, as others have mentioned, the ending was rushed, when a slow unraveling would have served the story better. I don't regret reading ""The Nautical Chart"", but I won't be keeping it for my library."
2,not at all captivated,"I'm distressed to say that this book is boring me to death. Arturo Perez-Reverte is one of my favorite writers, and I've devoured all of his other books, but this one is just a chore to get through. It's not that the story isn't interesting, because it is, it's that the language is dead. The writing just isn't as enthralling as the past works have been. My only consolation is that this flaw seems attributable to the translator, not the author. I'll certainly steer clear of any future works translated by Margaret Sayers Peden, and I'll live in hope that none of his other books will be handled by her."
1,Waste of Time,"This book, and software, was written by a professor at the University of South Carolina. He first introduced it in the 1980's. He has been cashing in on it ever since by attempting to update it every few years. He requires all of his students to buy it, and use it. It is poorly written, in need of clearer explanations, and in my opinion is nothing more than a rehashed introductory accounting textbook. What a ripoff! If you want to learn corporate finance don't buy this book. I'm watching you Leroy."
2,Not the real thing!,"This CD has the right titles, however the orchestration and the back-up are absolutely atrocious. Also at times Humperdink sounds like Willy Nelson, there is none of that warm vibration that you would expect. The collection of songs is good, some of the execution is decent, but the overall quality of the recording is absolutely below par. Buy Humperdink, but not this production!"
3,Very disappointed in the GT 2120,"I have been in the 2000 series from ASICS for over 15 years. I loved the 2110. I run a half marathon about every two to three months. The 2110 was awesome for the half and for the training. Since buying this ""improved"" model I have more sore and bruised toes, and the heel slips no matter how I lace the shoes. I have also noticed more foot pain after completing a long run in this model. I have tracked down a pair of 2110s online and have ordered them. I hope they hold me over until I find something I love as much. It certainly won't be the 2120."
4,Wish it was more than a rehash,"This cd is, indeed, excellent. I'm disappointed in the fact that it is more of a reissue than an original cd. I think the sound on this one is more updated than the original, though. I saw Rockapella perform live twice now and still think acapella is my favorite kind of music. Rockapella knows the score in this department."
2,not worth the money,There is no doubt that this is good lotion. However it is not worth the price at all. My son's pediatrician recommended vanicream for his eczema and sensitive skin. It works just as good if not better and you get 3 times as much for the same price.
3,Didn't work for me,"Since a young age I have suffered from very sensitive skin. I work in a daycare and constantly am washing my hands, as well as children's hands several times per day. My skin becomes dry and cracked. Because of this I have been looking for a hand lotion that does not irritate my skin.I chose this product because of its claim that it is appropriate for children/adults with very sensitive skin. Unfortunately this product did not work for me. My skin soon became mildly itchy and red after applying the lotion. I will say however, that it did not cause the effects that some lotions have, which is swelling/hives, intense itching, and red skin which is slightly painful to the touch.I have not given up on this brand yet, my next try will be the Calendula Cream, and Calming Moisturizing Cream"
3,not very good,"I am aiming for MCAD, this is the last exam that i will have, the book is not very good in explaning windows form and controls, it is too brief, I have to read lots of examples in the internet. The other things are OK..but not very good still..You need a lots of supplement reading,actually, i buy the 70-320 book with the same author, the book only covers 60% of the exam, I think this boo, too"
2,Not really happy,I was looking forward to this treat. I was disappointed when I got it because it had sunflower seeds. Sunflower seeds are bad for guinea pigs! Nowhere in the description did it say that it had sunflower seeds.So I did end up giving the treat to my guinea pigs but only after I had taken out the sunflower seeds myself. (pretty hard since there were some inside the treat not just on the outside)One of my guinea pigs loved it and chewed it all but the other one didn't even want to touch it.I wouldn't recommend it because you have to take out the sunflower seeds out. You could leave them in but then there is a chance your guinea pig might choke on the hulls. :(
1,Really Bad,"This is one of the most poorly written books I've ever read.The initial concept of a fully automated hospital was interesting, although I'm not sure patients would be flocking to be treated by robots, with no human contact. The character development was poor, and it is particularly in the area of dialogue that Shobin falls flat on his face. The theme of replacing people with technology mirrors Shobin's strengths and weaknesses as a writer: He deals well with the technology, but very poorly with the people and their interactions with one another."
5,Song For Lovers,This is such a beautiful song!!! The first time I heard it I just wanted to fall down and cry. In the song Jesse shows his true feelings for the girl of his dreams and I believe that every man should make their girl feel special!
1,"This is / was a truly an awsum ""epic"" album","This is / was a truly an awsum ""epic"" albumI have the epic label vinyl and cd. I have loved it dearly since the first time I heard it in my teens. I bought this remaster because The cd was skipping. The remaster is awsum, if you hate dynamic range and song intros. Both are missing from this remaster. To its credit it has added some balls in the eq. department, but I can do that with my eq. I think sony has done disservice to this magnificent piece of work. PLEASE, look for an old epic label copy in good shape and don't bother with this remaster, it has little to offer, two extra cuts and two MONO mixes of the hits. with a cut in intros and dynamic range. THANK YOU SONY! Do yourself a favour skip the sony remix and seek out the ""epic"" pressing, you will not regret it, not for one nanosecond. I rate this five stars for the original epic pressing. One star for the remaster."
4,More ideas in one album than in many artist's entire careers,"This album is a roller coater ride through a fast changing range of styles and emotions. ""Nature's Way"" has to be one of the top 10 'message' rock songs of all time. There are many other excellent efforts here as well. Not all songs will be everyone's cup of tea, but the band moves quickly from song to song, often with breathtaking effect."
3,"Good reference, lacks instruction","This is a good reference book. If you can re-create nail art from looking at pictures, then you should get it. If you need detailed instruction, you should NOT get it - it doesn't provide the steps. I bought the book without the kit ... book only was not a bad deal and I have my own paints and brushes already, anyway. I personally am glad to have this book. I am always looking for inspiration, and I can modify these designs to fit what my client wants. If your budget can afford it, get it."
3,My honest opinion...3 stars - for the designs only,"I was in search of a really good nail art book and I bought it because I have read many favourable reviews on this particular book online.Sadly, I don't think this book is not as fantastic as what the others says. The designs shown were great but the instructions were brief and lame. There isn't a step-by-step instruction guide for you to follow carefully. I personally feel that I can do better without the instructions (just leave the pictures behind). However, I do like the nail paints that are included in the kit, they are easy to apply and of better texture than nail polish. Nevertheless, after 6 months of possesion of this kit, I've yet to create those designs."
5,Delbert - Live From Austin,"To start with, I DON'T like country music. With that said, this CD rocks. I had to try a Delbert McClinton CD after listening to Imus drone on daily about Delbert McClinton and started out with this CD. I am particularly a fan of tight bands and they just don't get tighter than his. The twangy ones I can do without but overall this CD rates a 6 on a scale of 5. And if you get the chance to see him and his band live, well, don't miss it. Pay any money. You will not be diappointed."
1,Son Isn't Feeling It,"Shipping speed was awesome but the actual product itself was very disappointing. My 4 year old son normally loves similar toys but he actually asked me what this was and what he was supposed to do with it. Needless to say, it hasn't been touched since."
1,BEWARE - SUPER AUDIO CD Format Does Not Play!!!,"With great anticipation, I purchased this CD but it came in some obscure ""Super Audio CD"" format by Sony. It is unplayable on my CD player and unreadable on my laptop. The Amazon product description does not designate this. Bummer. Now I have to go through some return/replace hassle."
5,Great fusion,Great classic fusion. A must for any collector of jazz or serious audiophile. IMPORTANT: SONY(Columbia) prevents you from making copies of the songs on your home CD recorder.
5,Desert Island worthy,"This great band pulled it all together on this, their finest recording. Brilliant compositions played with brio by five fabulous musicians who created a sound that's unlike anything before: it's Weather Report music, and there is no genre term that can confine it. If you haven't heard this recording, you have been on a desert island, and if I am ever marooned, I want, nay, need to have this recording with me. It should be considered a classic of 20th-century music."
3,"Not yet ""candy music"", but near to it","This is one of those albums with some good tunes, but they grow boring after some time. There's not enough improvisation on it. Wayne Shorter should have done more. Zawinul lays out red carpets of synthesizer sounds, but nobody walks along on them, only some ants or other bugs."
2,Nice Hat,"Listen to the version of Birdland from the String Cheese Incident's album ""Carnival '99,"" it's orchestrated a lot better and realy puts across what these guys must have been trying to do."
3,THESE ARE INSTRUMENTAL VERSIONS!!!!,This cd is an instrumental and has no vocals on it. BE AWARE IF THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT!!!
5,Very thorough!,"lots of important people in Spiritualism are revealed here within it's pages. Names of people who helped the movement, but were long forgotten. Great pictures, too!My only issue is that some of the reference materials listed after the articles does not seem to be in print any longer if a person would like to read further about a medium or a place.I highly recommend this bok, though, to anyone interested in spirit communications and mediums."
3,A good guide if you try to understand occult terminology.,"Recommendable if you want to know more. While I am interested in the subject, I found much of it presented as if fact rather than speculation. Not good, as we know nothing for certain.A word of warning: From the experience of a friend of mine, I can tell you that it is dangerous to delve deeply. The Occult world has a gate that, once you opened it, can not be closed. While this book might help you to understand what is happening, it is your unconscious that controls this access and not your rational thinking. I have decided to leave it closed.PS: A much more enjoyable fable on quantum field travelling spirits, is Max Pucher's 'Journey To Eden'."
2,An Incomplete Text,"While this book makes some very good points concerning generalities in performing real estate market analysis, it did not offer clarification on the specific process of performing market analysis on multiple property types. Some sections are better than others. For instance, although the book notes that Office and Industrial makes up 62% of the commercial real estate market, it doesn't explain how to conduct a specific demand anlaysis for these property types. You would think office and industrial properties would be addressed seperately, but the book groups the discussion of both property types, noting that the trend is toward combining the uses. Also, everything is explained with development projects in mind, rather than from the perspective of purchasing existing real estate assets. Basically the book is mostly fluff with little substance or explanation of how to gather and analyze the appropriate data."
2,Do not waste your money,"I am an avid reader of investment books, especially real estate. I work in the real estate field in an investment capacity and I am always on the look out for new books on the topic of real estate investing. This book is simply not very good. There is not a lot of detail in any of the chapters, its very short on financial analysis and I don't find it written well. I have found myself reading 5 pages and saying what the hell is this guy saying and waiting for his point or gem but it never happens. This book is way overpriced for what it is, this should be a clearance special for 5.99. The real estate game by poorvu is hands down a much better book, not even a competition, save your money and get that book. Flat out this book stinks... Not to detract from the author, I hear he has great excel and argus classes, I would have figured he would have put that into his book."
5,Simply one of the greats,"One of the greatest rock cds ever released, this little-known gem is stunningly packed with brooding, hopeless lyrics that tell us that nothing is left, nothing matters, and there is no release.God Damn the Sun and (She's A) Universal Emptiness are two of the most desolate, powerful songs I've ever heard.Outstanding cd without a weak track."
4,Bill Gage returns!,"This isn't as good as TUNNELVISION,but it still kicks ass.Bill Gage is still an alcoholic,and he's also addicted to cocaine.He's checked into a detox clinic.He has to kill a guy who's decided that Bill is the Antichrist.Meanwhile,a sicko known as The Walking Death kills people with a razor-tipped dildo.This book is sick,complete with blood,mutilated babies,Gates's Prince references, and excellent writing.Fans of Ivy rejoice,for he makes it into this book."
4,"Smart, funny... and Canadian!","(...and Jewish, too! What more could you want?)I don't care if he's not David Sedaris, and it's just plain weird that the two are lumped together almost constantly because of the obvious similarities in their first names and the fact that their career paths might have crossed once or twice. Rakoff is funny and insightful in his own right, and I'm glad that I came across his work.Compared to other young essayists of his calibre, there's something a little more human, a little less, well, ""New York,"" about Rakoff (maybe it's the Canadian in him), and it makes his work stand out against a crowd who often try too hard to be ironic (or post-ironic, or whatever it is they're trying to be when they write stuff I just don't ""get"").Whatever it is, I'm very much looking forward to seeing more from this particular David."
4,"All in all, a pretty good album","The title song is excellent, as is ""Jesus is Just Alright."" I don't really care for the warbly ""Jack Tarr the Sailor"" and ""Oil in My Lamp"" as much as I do other Byrds songs. They strike me as a bit boring. And the version of ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"" is much different (again, slower and less exciting) than the earlier, unreleased version that eventually appeared on rarities compilations and the Byrds box set. However, this is still a very worthwhile album. It just doesn't rank among my favorite Byrds albums."
3,Would not order again.,I am a Boots No 7 user with excellent results. In the past I have used Philosophy products and was always pleased - not so much with this product.
3,"Good Series, Wierd, and Unfulfilling Ending","I love Bubblegum Crisis, and all the characters, but this ending was just too whacked for me. I know lots of people might like this but lots of things are left unresolved at the very end...though it is uplifting and poetic.The fight scenes between Galatea and Priss+MotoSlave are some of the best in the Series, and packed with that nail-biting emotion all anime fans love.If there was one thing I could change about this (except for a better ending), it would be to have Sylia have a more important role in the last two episodes, but she mostly sits this one out. But yet again, Priss comes through to save the day!So: must watch if you have seen first 11...only a 3-star by itself."
5,New Hardsuits and more trouble!,"This volume of Bubblegum Crisis was great, everyone has new hardsuits and the action is almost non-stop the first episode and then settles down a bit until the cliffhanger ending. Curse these addicting Anime volumes. You can never buy just one."
3,"Good overall, car power adapter weak","I purchased this DVD player mainly for use in the car on a long trip with a toddler. I like the tablet style and the bag mounts to the back of a headrest nicely. Overall picture and sound quality are very good for a portable player. Works great with the battery or the ac power cord inside. Barely works AT ALL with the cheap car power adaptor included with the player. Takes many attempts to get it to power the player, a real pain with a squirmy kid in the backseat. I was able to attach the battery, invert the player and invert the picture using the ""mode"" button for a couple hours, and it fit in the car headrest bag if I didn't fasten the top. Solution: go to Radio shack and get a decent ""adaptaplug"" and extension cord. Cost about $20, now it works with no problems. Easier for me than messing the warranty hassle from RCA. Overall good, if you don't mind buying an extra car plug."
2,Packaging Leaves Much to be Desired,"While the lentil seeds sprouted just fine, I ended up with only about half an order due to poor packaging.I did complain to the Sprout House but heard nothing back. I'll do my seed buying at the store from now on,I guess."
3,"Good, but not as good as I'd hoped!","I love her show and her recipes always look amazing. I couldn't wait to receive the book, and then the first three recipes I made (with expensive ingredients) all flopped! I'm a bit apprehensive about using it again. I have, however, used it for ideas, and I greatly enjoyed reading it."
3,The Highwayman,"I liked how Ballou created a plausible plot based on the classic poem; however, parents of younger readers, who make up the primary audience, need to be aware of a considerable amount of cursing within the story."
5,othello classic,"As wonderful a production of Othello as there can be found. Plus, it's shot as a stage production which gives it leverage as an educational tool."
4,BLACKBYRD by DONALD BYRD a year ahead of this one,"Headhunters is very good and funky but I hope you all realize that Donald Byrd,along with the visionary Larry Mizell,recorded BLACKBYRD(blue note's 1st million seller)in 1972. BLACKBYRD is unbelievable!Funky with soul and jazz and Harvey Mason and Chuck Rainey inventing the modern funk.Please,if you like Headhunters and missed the absolute trailblazing,pioneer work of Mizell and Byrd,pick up Blackbyrd. It must have blown Herbie's mind 'cuz a year later he was gittin' funk-ay!"
5,"A ""Jazz Masterpiece"" that truly is","Close your eyes and let Herbie Hancock take you on a tour of the urban landscape, circa 1970's. Music that is funky, potent, and cool."
4,Cute and Fun,"I was actually surprised when I listened through the entire album and enjoyed every song. Usually you can't look at an album cover that looks like it's from some supermodel's photo shoot and expect to take the music seriously. Luckily with Kylie, you don't have to.Every song is energetic and fun, with a unique dance beat and subtle harmonies. With a lot of albums that feature electronic/dance music, the songs all sound the same, and after 4 or 5 tracks, you lose all patience and have to turn it off. Not this one. Each song is actually different enough from the previous one that when the album is done playing, you actually wish it weren't.Lyrically and musically, I think this album shows more talent and originality than most pop music you hear on the radio. ""In Your Eyes"" stands out as my personal favorite. Unfortunately, while I enjoyed the rest of the songs, I wasn't really fanatical about them and don't really expect to listen to them more than occasionally."
3,The back cover deserves five stars,"Four stars for the front cover (American-watered version), and Three stars for this mixture of Kraftwerk-played Cher and Europop. I'm deeply infatuated with Kylie, and I think she's beautiful, but that's it. No more. This is a great CD cover with a nice soundtrack. For when you wanna go eat junk food."
5,Too Bad she is not promoted in America GREAT CD,"Is defintly a great album is a shame that her record company is not willing to release the domestic version would be a great succes, the album is really dance and good beats for each song, definitly the best album from Kylie really worthy to buy it and keep as one of the favorites. Right now the album is one of the favorites in Europe. If you'd like Light Years this is better yet."
3,PURE ENERGY!!!,"THIS ALBUM IS NOT BAD HOWEVER IT IS SLIGHTLY LIGHTWEIGHT. SHE HAS VERY NICE, BREATHY LAYED BACK VOCALS. THE HIGHLIGHTS ARE ""DANCEFLOOR"", ""IN YOUR EYES"" AND ""LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT"" WHICH BRINGS TO MIND CAHTY DENNIS. IN ADDITION GET MILLIE JACKSON-""A MOMENT'S PLEASURE"" AND SAMANTHA FOX-""21st CENTURY FOX"". I WAS NOT DISSAPPOINTED BY ANY OF THE SONGS GENERALLY. MY FAVOURITE SONG IS ""LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT""& ""IN YOUR EYES"". IF YOU LIKE DANCE-POP TRY THIS ALBUM OUT. SIGNED... MUSIC FAN."
5,Get on the Dancefloor!,"... This is a great album! I personally could do without More More More, but all of the other songs are great ear candy. Dancefloor and the ubiquitous Can't Get You Out of My Mind were written by 80's dancefloor diva Cathy Dennis (Just Another Dream, Move to This) and deserve a place among the best dance tracks this year. If you have the choice, go for the enhanced CD with bonus tracks. This includes Butterfly, a great ephervesant song screaming for remixing."
4,Very Well Done :),"Kylie's Fever is a great album if you want pop-py, dance music. I love the song ""Dancefloor"" and her current hit single ""Love At First Sight"" is a wonderful song and has gotten a lot of airplay. Hopefully Kylie will stun us again with another great album!"
2,Passing Clouds,"The first time when u listen to her first hit ""Can't Get You Out Of My Head"", it will stick in your head with her catchy chorus line of LA LA LA. You may even like it for a start. But it won't be long that you get sick of the LA LA LA as well. This song has no exceptional lyrics too.The rest of the album sounded the same, the same catchy beat, that you will probably not listen to it after a few plays.Though Kylie has made a break through after a long break but her vocals is not something that you would give credit for. You may like to give credit only to her catchy tune of her songs."
5,a dance masterpiece,Fever is easily Kylie's greatest album so far and one of the best dance/pop/disco records of all time. A wonderful set of music that showcases all of Kylie's talent since Impossible Princess.
3,School Rumble Vol.1,"First off, I did not buy this off amazon. I bought it at the dvd/music ect store F.Y.E. All my friends who like anime were reccomending it to me, so i thought i would give it a try. I bought vol. 1 and i was not very into it at all. It was a real suprise to me, though, sice i laugh so easily, i did not laugh one bit watching this. Sorry! Anyways, If you REALLY want a funny anime, i would suggest something like Lucky Star or Azumanga Daioh. Because School Rumble really isn't that great of an anime. The opening theme gets very annoying after a while, just thought i would point that part out. Since there are so many other reviews, you probably know what it is about already. Yah, I'm done now. Please go out and buy azumanga daioh or lucky star vol.1, they are much better. Seriously! Thanks!"
1,"""guarantee""","I used this item less than 10 days and it stopped working. It was clearly the switch. The pad itself is great - no sliding cover, no sharp plastic corners but since it doesn't work it was a terrible waste of money. I am disabled and I work a 50 hour week and returning things is just not in my nature so I still have it. Please do not purchase this item if you need reliability."
2,hot pad,It doesn't get very hot/warm. For how large it is it didn't get but luke warm. Other thank that it would be a wonderful item for its size.
2,Broken Controls,"When I first bought this - I couldn't have been happier. It didn't crumple, the heat was even - I thought I had found the perfect heating pad. Then the controls stopped working entirely. Not a year old, and my much needed heating pad was functionally useless. Because of this - I really cannot recommend this product."
5,great heating pad,"I did alot of research on various heating pads. I went to many retail outlets such as drug stores and stores such as Walmart and Target. I could not find any good heating pad, and all of them were expensive. This is the best for the money. It has a two hour shut off as well as continuous ON. I use a wet cloth on my back with the heating pad. It works great for pain relief. You will not regret this purchase."
5,Probably the best #2!,"I have had several of these Sunbeam soft heating pads. I have already used this new one and the high setting is pretty hot, thus I am using the 3 to 4 heat setting. I like the new fancy control too.I like that I can put it on 2 hour setting or on continuous setting too.I am hopeful that they have the ""bugs"" worked out of the control system as it is usually what goes bad...I am going to hold on to my receipts and packaging just in case this one goes bad too. I have tried other brands of this same type heating pad and the control on them goes bad too. Probably all made by the same company."
4,Obscure title in Byrds catalog is better than rep,"I had read some less-than-enthusiastic reviews of this record, so maybe I wasn't expecting much, but I hear lots of sweet country tunes and at least three daring,innovative tracks(wheel's on fire,king apathy III and Bad Night at the Whiskey) It's basically sweethearts part 2 with some unexpected heavy rock moments that are quite effective. Of course, Hillman and Gram Parsons are missed, and the last track-a blues medley- is lame, but then it's a Byrd tradition to end a record with a throwaway. Every time I hear that well known funkster McGuinn utter the immortal line ""Bringing my soul brothers down"" in Bad Night, I crack a smile."
3,"Thorough questions, but not good enough","This book has a lot of questions. However, they might not help you in any way as one would expect. Some are simple as: what are your views on a generic political issue. However, if you want more in-depth questions, don't expect it."
3,50/50,"Eh, not bad, not excellent though. I like the questions really make you think of things you wouldn't really ask. It's creative in that sense. But after a while it starts becoming a Lil boring, to me at least. I still haven't finished the book. I answer a few then get caught up doing something else."
1,Inappropriate and Base,"Not at all what I expected. Certainly not appropriate for an older relative. The glowing recommendations make me worry about our society. Do you really want to know about a parent or grandparent's sexual fantasy and if it has ever been fulfilled? Are you curious about the relative someone likes least and why, who they would kill if no retribution, who they think should be killed and if someone picks their nose? If so, this is the book for you."
3,Worth the money - not much more,"Many of them were poorly stitched and had flaws but for the $1.43 per ballit all came out to, its still a better deal then anything I could pick up locally.Note:The balls have the word PRACTICE written on them in green."
5,Soooo much fun!!!,"I bought this RC for my little cousins along w/ the ULTROX AR RC, after taking them to a comic convention in San Diego. They got to play w/ the cars and they went on their ""Must have"" list. Both cars are pretty fast and durable, which is good, because my cousins spend more time smashing them into each other and trying to run each other off the road than actually ""racing"".The coolest thing is that they open up by remote control and have characters that light up inside the cars. Apparently, there are action figures of the characters too, but I haven't been able to find them yet. It also came w/ a pretty cool comic book."
1,Unfathomably stupid setup.,"I'd like to write a review of the game itself, but unfortunately I can't even play it! Not only do you need to install the steam software to play online, but you have to install it for offline single player mode as well! Hey Valve, here's a newsbreak-not everybody has a high speed connection! When I purchased this game (for forty bucks), I knew I wouldn't be able to play online right now, but I figured I would be able to at least play the single player modes offline without installing Steam. So now what do I have? A forty dollar beer coaster. Thanks Valve. Needless to say, I won't be buying any Valve or Steam-related games ever again. You just lost a customer before even using your product. What a shame."
4,OfNoConsequence,I bought it to play Counter-Strike source. Was tired of playing Counter-Strike 1.6 through Half Life 1. Thanks.
2,"A very, very disappointed customer. OH WOE TO VALVE!","I purchase this game for 20 dollars, I install it, and to my disappointment, it freezes on the loading screen. I underwent all the basic procedures of updating my video drivers (I have an ATI Radeon Xpress 200), made sure that Direct X was updated to its full capacity, I uninstalled and exited all unneccessary programs that may have interfered with Steam-but yet, I still get no response. once in a while, the game will tempt me by allowing me to get into the Main Menu and even once, letting me play parts of the first level. But NOOO! These brief excursions pose only as false hopes. I've gone through hours now trying to fix the problem.I am very disappointed. Well, I'm going to go back to playing Minesweeper now. So much for high end gaming."
2,Steam-Blasted,"The game's great, but jumping through all 579 hoops required to register a Steam account just isn't worth the time and effort. Lord help you if you lose your Steam password, as I did.The process for lost password: they send you an e-mail with your registration number and ask you a ""secret question"", which is: ""what was the last secret passphrase we asked you?""!!!!!! I lost the password, but I'm supposed to know not only the ""passphrase"", but when it was asked?You can't even e-mail these clowns for support unless you create a ""support account"", yet ANOTHER password!Doing my taxes was far easier than dealing with Steam. They managed to kill any enjoyment I might have had from the game."
1,Do not Purchase!!!,"Single player game -yes! Why then do you have to install and run, and connect to the internet, the steam software that is required to even load the game. The game would be incredible if it weren't for the steam software integraded into the ""single player"" play. I will never buy from valve again, absolutly horrible!!!!!!"
2,Steam and the Awful Install Ruin an Otherwise Great Game,"The game itself was great. But the AntiPiracy Program ""Steam"" is a Steaming Pile. First off the Install takes forever.Say you pop in your disc to play your single player game, Well if Steam wants to update your halflife copy. Well you'll just have to wait to play your game, Steam has some updating to do.One time I popped in my disc, half hour later the splash screen has no link for single player... what is this. I don't want to play online. I just want to play my game. This is so Frustrating.Because of a few people pirating games, us paying customers have to suffer. I would pay twice as much for a game to Never have to go through anything like Steam ever again."
1,Half-Assed2 - Virus of the Year Edition -,"How many times should a person attempt to install and play a game? 1?...2? ..3? I won't attempt to run this STEAMing pile of dung on my machine past 3. This is my first, only and absolutely last STEAM / VALVE game I will ever buy."
1,perfect!,"best game out there! valve has outdone there self again!pros:great graphicsgreat musicgreat weapen controlscons:theres lots of glitches if you dont do something right then you have to reload your game so you may want to save ALOTit takes a LLLLOOOOOONNNNGGG time to load and the ""scanning steam game updates"" stops you from playing the game for about an hour then another hour to load the updateyou run out of ammo fastif your a hard core gammer and like fps games this is the best!"
5,Horrible Cheesy Goodness,"If you have ever seen TheCinemaSnob, then you know what this is. It's horribly acted, filmed and directed, and it's cheesy all the way. While the movie's are in NO SENSE GOOD, they're just so awful they make up for it, at least partially."
4,A believable account.,"I live and work in Johnston County Oklahoma. I didn't know Loy Factor, but I know many people that did.There are one or two of the facts concerning Factors capture I don't agree with, but other than that I find the book very believable.A must read book for anyone interested in the Kennedy assassination."
2,yawn,"the flow of the concert is chopped up. some of the performances are not worth capturing for posterity: ramrod, out in the streets, prove it all night. ""the land of hope and dreams"" has weak lyrics that sound like they were created by a computer program using bruce's old lyrics as a database. some good moments to be sure. but when is bruce going to release a live album that captures his live show. this sure ain't it."
5,"The Boss, what more to say?","Still the best. Saw the two shows in Denver and this brings back great memories from those shows and the 35+ I saw over the last 25 years. Don't pay attention to the playlist, intentional or a typo? Nice surprise."
4,What a band!!,"These guys, all of them with 50 or more years of age, are simply INCREDIBLE!! THey deliver here a solid, breathtaking performance, full of nuances and surprises and sheer enjoyment. It's a night to remember.I suggest to buy the DVD also. It's fantastic. Bruce and The E-Street Band belong to each other."
4,Re-live the magic,"I was at the July 1st show at the Garden, the night some of the songs on the CD where recorded. It was a great night and the live album lets me relive it. I'm especially pleased Bruce included the classic, ""Lost in the flood"" - in my opinion, one of Bruce's best. My only wish was that ""The Promise,"" which he played the final night, was on there. Overall, the CD still proves after all these years--Bruce is still the boss, especially regarding live shows. But to really capture the magic, you gotta see the master in the flesh! He leaves his heart and soul on the stage every show(along with 3 buckets of sweat). Now THAT you can't capture on a CD."
3,LOST THE MAGIC!!,"Although there are some bright spots on this CD,the song selection as well as the way he and the band delivers them suggests that father time may be catching up on him.Songs like American Skin and The River are very boring and go nowhere. Even some of his classics like Tenth Avenue Freezeout lack the zip they used to have back in the 70s and 80s. The bright spots are Born to Run and Out in the Streets as well as a few others but overall I would say that the years away from the E-Street Band has destroyed the magic and chemistry this band once had. However,compared to most of the garbage that is out there these days(90s and beyond),this CD,although disappointing is still better than most."
5,Great intro to tantra for the rest of us,"After taking workshops in which I was the only gay person/couple in the group, this video was a refreshing reminder that tantra works for same-sex couples too. This DVD is a great intro to tantra for the gay crowd and after watching it I immediately signed up for one of Pamela's workshops. She's a wonderful tantrika and I'd highly recommend both the DVD and her workshops."
3,Educational Documentary,"This video is more what I would call an educational documentary on tantra, almost clinical. It was really not what I expected given other reviews. Very 'New Age' and somewhat educational, I've already given it to a new agey friend who may get more from it than I did."
5,Dog didn't care!,"The economy housebreaking pads are ""seconds""...not perfect in manufacture, but the dog did not care, and they worked just as well as the more expensive ones."
5,NBu110ck,As with The Corps and the Officers Honor Bound is outstanding. Once I start reading it is very hard for me to put the book down. WEB Griffin is by far my favorite author and has been for some time. When I finish rereading the Honor Bound series and The Corps I'll start over on the Officers.
4,Too long for what it has to offer.,"400 to 500 pages is ideal for a Griffin book. This one, at over 700 is way too long. With a strong penchant for character bakgrounds and development, the pacing of this story suffers. After a while I began to say, enough already, get on with it. But alas, it was not to be. The anti-climactic conclusion was insufficient solace for seeing it to the end."
4,Maggie the cat,"This Maggie really is a cat, one who loves her master, Nicholas, so much that she wants to become human. Old Tom grants her wish, but, as with any wish, there are conditions and Maggie must meet them while struggling to adapt to being human.Nick is very appealing. You can understand why Maggie would go to all the trouble she does for him. The supporting characters, Hoop and Deenie, are also fun. The writing is humorous and sexy and there are great details. For example, the human Maggie loves to dress in catsuits.This book is as magical and appealing as its heroine."
4,DAMN GOOD FISH,"I was trolling around Amazon for some new blues albums and, having been frustrated by the large number of albums with no sampling availability, found this gem.It's, overall, a good selection of tunes with only a couple that sounded like half-hearted cast-offs. More than enough here to warrant repeated listens."
4,Lots of interesting stories,"I've read a lot about WWII - this CD audio book had some obscure tales that I had never heard of. Interesting material, well-produced."
2,its okay,"Tim Allen plays a quite jumpy older dude who is/was involved with 6 women. He does not really know who to marry next. When Tim Allen's character dies on vacation, his former, current and ""soon to be ex"" are coming together for his funeral.The movie has an unexpected ending.The movie is okay to watch, but it did not really make me laugh as usual. Nothing my dvd collection really needed, but I did not know the movie before I bought it."
4,About as good as it will get it appears...,"VHDL is used for a wide variety of things - almost none of them what VHDL was every really meant for. This makes finding a useful text a reference a significant chore. Ashenden sometimes seems to move at a snail's pace - the text is written more as a tutorial than a reference. In some ways this is good, really the syntax of VHDL and the constructs are quite simple. His repeated examples make it clear there really isn't much magic going on. Personally I wish the book was more directed at synthesis - because that's what I use it for - but this text is more directed at the language. So some supplementing of the text will be necessary.In short, it could be better but I'm not sure how and for my requirements it appears to be about the best the market has to offer."
5,Superb read! You'll love it!,"Rarely do I read a book that I would pick up and read for a second time. This novel is one of the few that I have done that with. It is a mix between a ""ugly duckling"" and ""cinderella"" story. Girl is quiet and reserved, boy is wild,girls are warned to stay away from him. Boy takes his bad reputation and leaves to make a new life in another city. Ten years later she calls him back to town to participate in a dating game as the celebrity guest. He says he'll only come if she's one of the 3 female contestants he has to choose from. She begrudgingly agrees, and bam! He sees her as a grown ""fully matured"" woman for first time in ten years. This book gives a lot of sexual tension, which I find necesary for the characters to mesh, and keeps your attention all the way thru the story. Read it, Im sure you'll agree."
5,A classic!,This is basically the Bible of any qualitative researcher. I could sing an ode to Norman Denzin! An absolute must have!
5,Nice One From Freddie!,"the first 30 seconds are a little strange as freddie blows like crazy and then a drum roll is played. . . again. . . again. on first listen, i was scared. the first two cuts are long and funky. the groovy foundation is set up quick on both tunes, and then it's solo after solo. this isn't as bland as i make it sound. it's actually pretty exciting, but it's hit and miss. when it misses it's because the groove gets lost and, as you might expect, some of the solos are better than others. the playing is consistently good though and the solos are really creative and the artists aren't scared to venture into the unknown. the third track is a nice and tight ballad with trumpet, bass and guitar. it doesn't really fit the style of the rest of the cd, but it's still good and may be the best tune on the album. as usual for cti recordings, the supporting band is top notch."
3,Good but....,"I have no problems with the knives themselves, but I do take a little issue with their packing. When I got this set, their handles all seemed to have some sort of dust on them, and the wooden block seems to have some ink stain. Maybe this is unique to me, but the problem must have occured at source, because they come in pacdked boxes, apart from the Amazon packing. Hope they do a little better with the presentation."
1,Lacks Chinese characters essential for this type of book,This is an OCR print on demand version. It lacks the Chinese and other graphic characters which are essential in a book discussing symbols of a language. The English text is full of typos that it sounds gibberish.The only saving grace is that you get to download a scanned version of the original book. Better to get a version that has the Chinese charactersSound and Symbol in Chinese (Language & Literature) (English and Mandarin Chinese Edition)
4,Good Basics for CISSP review,"I felt the need to respond to the negative reviews of this book. The ISMH is designed to give the reader an introduction to specific basic material in a domain format under the CISSP program. It was never designed to be a brain-dump or all inclusive study guide to pass the exam. Subsequent volumes of this series either updates or introduces other topics in each domain.If you are looking for an all inclusive study-guide for the CISSP cert then this book is not for you. However, it is easily arguable that no book can be an all inclusive tome of the expansive subject matter the certification covers. I highly recommend the recommended reading list on the ISC2 web site."
1,Inconsistent and Occasionally Inaccurate,"I bought the book because I was told it was THE CISSP study guide. So far I have read thru chapter 8 and feel really sorry for anyone relying on this for accurate information. The chapter on extranets was complete rubbish, the chapter on SSO went on about specific vendor solutions and seemed out of place, the whole thing is disorganized and inconsistent, and I have since ordered the CISSP Prep Guide instead. I will finish skimming and reading some of what appear to be the better chapters on crypto and legal considerations until the other book gets here, after which I guess I will try to sell this thing! I give this book two thumbs down."
1,Don't Waste Your Money - A Ripoff,"The Video quality stinks, the audio is not much better, the DVD froze twice in the middle of the movie & I had to advance it , also you have to view a corporate logo RE on the screen the entire movie. No entertainment value at all."
1,WHY IN MONO?,"I'm beginning to think that the mastering engineers and producers at Mobile Fidelity have only one ear! Why would they release a stereo album from 1975 in Mono on SACD no less?! This is not some pre-stereo mono recording. It never was released on LP in mono. I don't get it. Yes, we know all about the ""back to mono"" camp, but this is going too far...."
2,A typical Ken Burns Production,"I've never been a big fan of Mark Twain, nor Ken Burns. Twain's work becomes tiresome and the same holds true for Burn's productions. While the basic idea of using period photographs and quoting actual documents is a good one, having actors and comedians give their views adds nothing to the picture. True, Hal Holbrook ""potrayed"" Twain on stage, but his interview was rambling and incoherant. And why was Dick Gregory interviewed ?Really, the PBS special could have been better. The book is a ""must have for Twain fans"", but otherwise I would ignore it.I ended up disliking Twain more after reading the book and seeing the series."
5,Love it,"There's lots of nice jazz/blues on this cd, great horn section, etc. I saw an ad in a guitarist's magazine of some sort once, that said Clarence is the only guitarist who's influenced more guitarists than he's been influenced by.I'm the 4th reviewer out of 4 to give it 5 stars - I predict that if you like blues you will like this CD; if you like jazz you will like this CD. If you don't like jazz or blues, well, I can't help you."
5,"Clarence ""Gatemouth"" Brown, ""Standing My Groung"" is a must own collection of Jazz and Zydeco",I would not hesitate to suggest that this should be in every American music collectors selection. Will not disappoint will always recommend with out reserve.
2,"Thought it would be healthier version of Flamin' hot cheetos, its not.","I love Flamin' Hot Cheetos and was expecting a healthier version of it in this.Saw a review on lifehacker or some other blog about these puffs. They were raving about it so I had to try.Nowhere near as spicy as Flamin' Hot. I got sick of these cause I had to finish off 12 bags of it. I gave a bag to some friends and they liked it.If you are looking for Flamin' Hot kick, these don't have it. More peppery if anything. Okay cheese flavor."
4,"good for the price, stylish and light","you need to apply extra rosin to the bow quite frequently. very stylish and light, easy to carry. bought this for my 11 yr old son. awesome for beginners or children. my son is very rough on his things and this has held up very well. looks very proffesional and the case is extremely nice. also protective. over all would purchase this item again and suggest it to anyone."
4,Not the best recorded concert,"Satchmo and the band are on fire and the program is really special. But I have a big letdown: the CD boasts that it is 20 bit mastered and super bit mapping. But nowhere on the cover they mention that on many selections Louis and the band are caught off mike. And since this CD is rather pricy, I felt a little cheated by Columbia/Legacy this time."
2,A very long run for a short slide....,"Very little actual running here. Mostly a Nike commercial. Lots of silly interviews that don't add anything. Watch one of the movies, instead."
4,Great if your a runner,This is just another great movie if you love pre and running. Plain and simple.
2,re:,"I was hyped to see this movie after reading the reviews, but once again you guys let me down. The fight sceens are not bad but not the best. I think it was an ok movie but i wish i hadnt bought it."
2,just ok,I read reviews about this being a classic must see. But I did not feel that way. I was more of a comedy than the traditional old school kung fu I was looking for
5,A MASTERPIECE!,A Masterpiece. I cant't believe I found this movie used for only 5 bucks. What else can be expected from the Opera Brothers ofJackie Chan? Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao are living legends.
5,A Wonderful Classic,"This little volume is a delightful classic in Christian Spirituality. Often it is shunned by the proud and intellectual as being 'to simple' and 'to basic' but, when it comes down to practical spirituality in everyday life, it's often the simple and the basic that we can remember and actually practice. In fact this book is used in formation in the Order in which I have the honor to be a member, and I have never heard anyone express anything but praise and gratitude for the book and its effect on their spiritual life. I heartly recommend it to anyone who is willing to read it with simplicity and a heart of prayer; I think you'll be very happy with the results."
5,Pistol Hose Spray,After going through several cheap plastic pistol grip water spray units this grip is a pleasure to use. I like it very much and it appears to be made very well.
2,should have paid more attention to size,"Hardly larger than a shot glass, I have used it to re-heat leftovers a few times. melt some butter in the microwave, that sort of thing, but way too small to for doing any real cooking. I have found similar ceramic baking dishes for as little as $4.00 locally."
2,Purchase at own risk,This phone is a piece of junk. I bought this phone six monthsago and now the info globe no longer works. The buttons onthe phone are small and the volume level is practicallynon-existent. It was really difficult to hear callers.The one feature that I liked was the info globe (when it worked)as I could see the caller id from across the room withouthaving to view the screen on the phone.
5,The truths shocked me! My views have been changed forever..,"I was so moved by this book that I wanted to speak to the author.Moved even more by the story of why Jack continues his quest to supply the facts.I now purchase random copies of any Emperor release and give them to people less likely to read this material.I believe that everyone capable of understanding the environmental issues facing mankind, should have this book on their required reading list.Each new release just exhibits the information and facts that much better.Someday this information could very well be as crucial to us as the bible.I can't wait for the 1998 updated.Special Thanks, to Jack and his associates and research assistants, and especially to Jack's friend to whom he promised to continue their mutual quest to enlighten the world about this conveniently unspoken conspiracy."
3,"Straight Forward History, Without any Frils","This is straight forward history of the conflicts between the northern and southern churches leading up to the Civil War. What is most interesting is that it destroys the popular myth that the churches were in the vanguard of the abolition movement. While there were some churches that were, they were the off shuts of the more established churches. It appears that the established churches were more interested in staying neutral and not creating conflict with their sourthern breathern then in fighting the evil of slavery.The book has written in a scholarly manner and is very dry reading. But, for anyone who wishes to understand the role that the churches played, or didn't play, in the abolition movement the book is a good read."
4,Importance of Evangelicalism in Anti-slavery conflict,"In the October 28, 1985 entry of my personal journal there is a reference to my having read this book. That was over sixteen years ago, I do not own a copy of the book, and I do not have present access to it. The major impression that remains on my memory was the additional confirmation this scholarly book provided as to the importance of Evangelicalism and segments of Evangelical churches in the battle against slavery."
5,"beyond ""classic""","There is no other....This CD should already be a part of anyone's collection, whether you enjoy jazz, classical, pop, country...whatever. You have not been properly exposed to music if you have never heard this one.Commit it to memory. Brubeck defies explanation and recommendation."
4,This is where it all began,"This is a great album. I have a friend who wore out his vinyl version of this. There's some great stuff here, and if you are a huge fan of the quarteet, then I recommend this. However, I think the Carnegie Hall concert recording is superior - so if you are only going to get one DB CD, get that one instead. On this CD, the quartet is still just getting used to the unusual time signatures, whereas by the time they get to Carnegie Hall, 9/8, 11/4, 5/4, whatever, it's in their DNA and it shows."
5,Classic!,"One of the most unique, beautiful albums ever recorded! If I were to make a list of the ten best jazz albums of all time, this would be on it."
1,The soldier's idea of a book,"""The Ascent of Everest"" is an enormous disappointment as a book, which was meant to introduce the reader to the mystery of the Mount Everest conquest in 1953, as written by the expedition leader. Snip: (...)"
4,a nice story for kids,"this is the story of amy stern and her family. they moved to a new neighborhood and like most children,amy wants to fit in. it takes a short while and she does. school is not so bad either,after making some friends.soon after, amy's mother is hit by a car and ends up in the hospital for months. aunt minnie moves in to help. THIS aunt minnie is quite a character!(but don't we all know someone like this?) the rest of the book is amy,her friends,and some ""adventures""-including fighting with the boys(ohh noooo.).the author,marilyn sachs has created a great character in amy. amy is sweet/sourand can be very naughty too (like when she lied about a owning a ball that belonged to another girl). later, amy feels remorse and admits the truth to the whole class!"
1,Don't let the price lure you,"I bought this unit after looking at all the MP3 players. According to the packaging it is no different from more expensive models, but it is. If the backlight wasn't on, there was only a black screen. I assumed this was a defect, so I returned it. The new one was the same. There is a marked delay when changing songs. Navigating the radio controls is very confusing. I only had the unit for a few hours before I returned it and got a more expensive MP3 player. If your going to spend the money, spend a little more."
1,Garbage,"I got one of these for Christmas, and I didn't even get to listen to a single song. The user-interface for the FM tuner did not work very well, so I followed the manual's instructions to do a firmware upgrade. I formatted as per the manual, and now the player is dead. Complete waste of money IMHO."
1,a lot of effort for garbage,the author put a lot of effort into developing this book but he must have spent a dollar getting it printed the photo quality is horrioble at best and the logos are all black and white don't waste your time
4,Outstanding source of Interesting sports logos. One of kind,"John Fulgaro's SPORTS LOGO GUIDE is the only book of it's kind and is with out a doubt a necesity for any true sports fan. He has gathered together obscure and defunct team and league logos across the US and Canada. He also shows the evolution of current teams logos and speciality ones for anniversaries and all-star events. The color front and back covers show many interesting logos. You may recognize the Chicago Cubs, but where did the Montreal Beavers play? One of my favorites is the Jersey Turnpikes. Very clever nickname and logo for a team that had to travel cheaply and often. All major sports are covered and any fan should add this book to his reference collection if doe no other reason then for more history about his favorite team and sport."
1,"WHAT A JOKE, IT DOESN'T GET WORSE THAN THIS","This has got to be the worst book I have ever read. It is totally STUPID and geared towards people with brains the size of peanuts. I can not believe I wasted my hard earned cash on such rubbish!The book talks about bedding twenty-six women from divas and debutantes, playgirls, evangelists and entrepreneurs, throughout America. WHO CARES!!... The book has no direction, no meaning, no purpose. Every adult knows how to bed a person, tell us something we DON'T know!. This book claims to be an erotic novel, it doesn't even come close!Would I recommend this book? maybe to my worst enemy!"
4,Benson is great,"This was from the later part of his jazz career, and I don't like this stuff as much as his work earlier, but it is still great jazz guitar! Benson is my favorite jazz guitarist, and this album is a good display of his chops. I definately recommend it.linclearnjazzguitar.net"
3,Natural Medicine First Aid Remedies,"This book is somewhat helpful. I'm not into ess. oils so that part does not help me. Alot of information that I didn't know, what to eat and do to for treatment. Fast Shipping."
5,Otherworld,"People might choose to buy this for the exotic voices, but that's...backwards. This group creates accessible, beautiful music. The uncanny, ethereal singing is a special treat for the ear that exists in a context of lovely folk music, music that takes one to another place, a place of plains and horses.That is not a flute! It is a human voice!"
4,Kazan,"Kazan is an adolecent whose family and friends were killed when he was still rather young. As the sole survivor of the Red Sands tribe, he has wandered since the fateful day the water demon stole Elsie, and destroyed his ""village"". He eventually meets up with a young girl named Fawna, and an old woman named Arbey, and they begin their adventure, on the road to Goldene, each seeking answers of their own in this stange city.I found ""Kazan"" a little depressing, and somewhat bloody, but on the whole, a good book. The first volume ends with the int that things will get better, and that Kazan has finally found someone who could be his friend."
5,Best Delivery in Existence,"I truly love this series. I wish they would record the entire dictionary the same way. If you want to listen to a super enjoyable vocabulary, this is it. The words might not be as advanced as you are looking for, but the fun in listening is worth the few dollars spent: five stars."
2,"the size if OK but the padding, nor the strap fit a DSLR","I own a 350d Canon DSLR, and I thought this would be the perfect bag.But... upon receiving it... The camera fits allright, but this bad lacks the padding my camera would require... And what's even worse, upon putting the bag on the shoulder, the strap is felt. It was not the case with my previous Lowe case.. and I believe that perhaps this is a good case for smaller cameras, but not for the smallest DSLRs..."
3,"Too small for larger DSLRs, crummy strap","Bought this for the Canon 30D because I needed something small that allowed quick access and the idea of the fast-opening zipper reeled me in. The case is too small for the 30D, but might be a good fit for a Nikon D40 or a Canon Rebel.I cannot fit both the camera and a neckstrap into the case, so the neck strap has to go out of the case, meaning the zippers cannot close, so I have to close the clip instead (ruining the ability to use the touted easy open access) and wear two neckstraps. Stupid all around. The strap included with the case is very thin flimsy nylon that is uncomfortable to wear as it digs into your shoulder.I'll keep this because it will protect the camera when I toss it into a backpack or something, but it is a total loss as a convenient case for a larger DSLR. It is nice looking though, and might be a good choice for a smaller camera."
5,Cute bag!!,"A very cute elegant bag if you want to carry a single lens body with an attached lens..you can stuff the memory cards, cables and battery charger, additional batteries in the side pockets.Very good price indeed.Btw i have a canon rebel xti.."
5,Great for day trips,"I purchased this product for a small quick bag to take on short day trips. It is well padded and protects my Canon XS, with standard lens, nicely. It is definately a small bag good for a minimalist. I would recomend this bag to anyone that needs a bag for a digital slr with one lens for quick transport. Holds a spare battery and memory card easily in the side pockets."
3,"Small and nice, but watch out for zoom lenses","This is a small and nice SLR case, although some more padding wouldn't hurt. Watch out for zoom lenses though. The T1i (same as Rebel XS, Rebel XSi, etc) will fit just too well with the 18-55mm lens, but it will *not* with with something longer, like a 55-250mm or 70-300mm. If that's your case, take a look at the similar SLRC-200 or SLRC-201 (both from Caselogic and also available on Amazon as of this writing)."
2,Terrible waste of time.,Just a boring story with a nothing ending. Not even the great actors could make it interesting. Not worth your time.
2,"""Humdrum and Morbidly Depressing""","There really doesn't seem to be enough ""meat"" on this movie to generate much viewer excitement. To the contrary, it is by-and-large a humdrum production, and its main claim to fame may be that the plot is morbidly depressing. Difficult to say why the ""Doctor"" in the story was give such a bad haircut--which was truly distracting. All-in-all, this film would have done better as an okay ""made for TV"" film."
5,LGA-YYZ Commuter,"What a great book! I can't think of anything they've left out. Five stars all round, but especially for being the most Web-savvy guide on the market. If you want an idiot-proof reference for Toronto in your pocket, go no further than this one. The others just don't come close."
5,Check this out for World Youth Day.,"If you're going to Toronto for World Youth Day, this is a really cool book to take along. There's lots of awesome maps and neat and useful stuff you probably won't find any place else. Check out all the Web sites and make sure to visit some of the neighbourhoods they've covered. I used this book on my last visit and found it a great guide. It's also inexpensive, really easy to use and fits in your pocket with no problem. Go for it!"
3,"OK for learning basics, but not good for advanced study","This is a very nice software package to learn SAS basics. But it does not have lots of advanced procedures. For example, ""PROC STATESPACE"" and ""PROC VARMAX"" among others used for forecasting time series are missing in this learning edition. It is very disappointing somehow if you try to learn more and deeper after learning some basics. However, it is still worth having it......"
5,Great way to learn SAS,"This product allows you to access many of the stat and graphical capabilities of SAS in a point and click environment. You can also see the SAS code generated so this is real handy for figuring out harder things like GRAPH code and certain STAT procedures.If you want to learn SAS for grad school or for work, this will make it much easier along with a book like ""Applied Statistics and the SAS Programming Language."""
4,Calming and seems authentic,"I read this book while commuting on the bus and it was like going into a peaceful bubble amidst the chaos of traffic and noise. It was very refreshing and the translated version has free-flowing verbage that recalls meditation. The best part of the book is the end when the author tells of his reintegration into ""normal"" society and his problems adjusting leading to eventual overcoming of these problems. This made the ideas in the book less unattainable by people who cannot seem to get enough vacation time from life to travel to Tibet and become enlightened."
1,Disappointing,This book lost its authenticity for me in the first few pages. It comes across as poorly written fiction with a brave attempt to impart some deeper spiritual teachings. Mainly surface stuff. I didn't learn anything from his tale.
5,buy this book!,"A friend sent me a review of Cooking the Roman Way. The reviewer made it sound too good to be true, so I ordered a copy to find out. Even for a passionate but untrained foodie like me, I've got to say that this is a great piece of work -- it's funny and articulate -- a literate cookbook that reads like a cross between fine travel writing and memoir. I have also found a bunch of classic Roman recipes that anyone can do -- bruschetta, spaghetti with garlic and hot pepper, Carbonara, Amatriciana, crostini with anchovies (my girlfriend loved that one in particular). I have been to Rome a couple of times and everything in the book rang true -- the atmosphere, the cooking style, the sites, the sensuality. Now I'm recommending the book to everyone I know, both for their own use and as gifts. What a find. Kudos (or however you say it in Italian) to the the author and photographer!"
2,Memorex 64MB Sports MP3 Player - MMP3642,"What I like: Scrolling text and One AA battery for 22 hours of continuous play.What I don't like: The text gets cut off sometimes, low amount of memory, Low volume, Slow music scrolling, bad music quality, and Not very well put together."
3,Use a different chocolate cupcake recipe...,"I got this book as a Christmas gift and just tried the first recipe out of it yesterday. Unfortunately, the basic chocolate cupcake recipe must not have been tested enough in the test kitchens! My cupcakes, like a lot of others who have reviewed this book, while delicious, were a visual mess. Sunken in the middle and so light that they had no strength and fell apart in my hands. I am an experienced baker, so I'll be trying them again with some modifications to see if I can fix the problems. Great ideas in here, but if one of the two the basic recipes doesn't work, then the book is flawed in one of its fundamental elements."
3,Not as cool as I hoped,"I am definately not a digital music expert but I know what I like. I heard the Afterlife track from these albums and bought them expecting the rest of the tracks to be similar. I was a bit dissapointed. I prefer a mix with at least some bit of memorable melody or sound but most of the tracks on here are monotonous excursions into the mundane. It may be a good background CD while you are doing something else that requires your full attention but it is not good for just listening. I found three of the 25 tracks to be enjoyable.Perhaps I prefer ""trance"" tracks to ""chill out"" tracks. The distinction is sublte but important. If you like trance, beware. If you like Digweed and Odenfold you might really like these albums. Just not my thing but it might be yours."
2,Good but slow,"This book is well written, JP Kenyon obviously knows his stuff, but it is dry and slow. In typical historical fashion this book is not an easy read, so a reader interested in a fast-paced representation of an era should not start with this book. It's a good overview of Stuart England, but the detail seems obscured and a bit unorganized. Save this book for research material, not for casual reading."
5,Excellent!,I really like this book. Have been interested in doing a few little candle mats (wool projects) lately and this book really adds to the ideas. Definitely worth it.
1,My Cats Are Not Fans of the New Food,"My cats have been happily eating Felidae Platinum for more than two years. I just got a new bag and the shape of the food is different. They tried the new food when I first put it in their bowls and now the bowls sit full and the kitties will not touch the food. I've noticed similar reviews related to formula changes in the past. Unfortunately, I now need to find a new food that my cats will eat."
2,weak,I expected more to this CD. While the music is lovely it doesn't stand out as unique. If there is such a thing as Appalacian Muzak this would be it. Nothing on it made me want to hear it again and again. It would make good background music I suppose but it's not memorable.
1,Doesnt work correctly,"This is the 3rd time I have purchaced this disc in the past year. In every case the pix is great, the background music is clear but the dialog is missing. I have 2 DVD players and it is the same on both. You just cant hear the dialog, it is missing. I have no porblem returning but it is strange that all of them are like this and no others."
3,The Movie Has Two Things Going for It!,"A unusual blend of comedy, horror, and religious symbolism, ""The Witches of Eastwick"" benefits from a first rate score from John Williams and the performance of character actress Veronica Cartwright as the only Eastwick resident suspicious of the mysterious ""Daryl."" She really ""threw"" herself into her role of which one must see the film to appreciate the pun!"
4,did i really do that,"strictly for fun! Jack and his ladies make you laugh,while letting you know,it's not good to play with fire! you will get burnt1"
5,"Twenty years old, and still worth it","As I can hardly believe that this movie is now twenty years old, I still see the worth in what it has to say about the roles of women in society and the price of that freedom. The twenty year-old special effects and the music aren't bad either."
2,The Witches of Eastwick,Very disappointed at actions and language of such fine actors. Special effects were well done but content was well below expectations
1,Too creepy,I had never seen this movie all the way through so I thought I would give it a try. Thank goodness it was free! There is something a little too creepy about the devil just being able to waltz in and charm three supposedly intelligent women. It doesn't seem to bother any of them that he is totally promiscuous. Jack Nicholson plays the same character in every movie. I got what I paid for.
5,Hilarious Film,"A fascinating film to watch. Jack Nicholson seduces and then gets shown the door by three beautiful women. Wonderful dialogue, with witty remarks and the salacious advances of the devilish Nicholson. Marvelous entertainment."
4,1/2 a really great book.,I give this book 4 and a half stars. why? because it was so well put together but only one flaw. It is a bit long. I read it and stayed with it til the ending. but still great fun to read.
2,NO SOUND EFFECTS PLEASE!,"Wow. Wished I had read this story rather than listen to it. The ""enhanced production"" was annoying."
1,Haste Makes Waste,"It's sad for me to say I agree with all these negative reviews. James Patterson is far too good a writer to have his name associated with this latest effort. It is a rehash of so many of his earlier books. Mr. Patterson... please, please stop trying for quantity; slow down and return to your true talent. You are way too good to continue trying to write too fast."
2,Runs out of steam at the end,"This is a typical Patterson book, until the last five chapters, and then it just sputters to a halt. Who exactly was the man who had the plastic surgery and jumped off the building? Why would Klara claim to be the wolf? What pressing business did Patterson have that kept him from re-writing this pitiful ending?"
1,Big name author writes a dud,"I was very disappointed with every aspect of this novel. The story line was choppy and the plot was weak. None of the characters were well developed and the action sequences just didn't have any flow whatsoever. This was an amateurish effort and I'm a little disappointed that the reviews on the back blurb were so favorable. I'll need to check Amazon reviews in the future, to get a better sense of things next time."
3,Easy Way Out,"Let me preface my comments by saying that I have been a big fan and devout reader of the Alex Cross books. Nonetheless, with London Bridges, Patterson has become lazy. Essentially, the story lamely comes to an end with many loose threads inadequately addressed or explained. Frankly, given this book and its predecessor, the story doesn't make sense. For once, it would be nice for the villain to be brought into custody to reveal his motivations. Without revealing the ending, it appears that Patterson is comfortable with just simply ending the story or perhaps inviting future books. Overall, an exciting beginning that built to an unsatisfying ""conclusion."""
5,Good deal,Love the Alex Cross series and glad to find since our local bookstores r gone. Great shape and on time!
3,Fair but Not His Best,"Not one of the best. I've read the first 10 in order. Patterson is scoring on 80% with me so far. Unfortunately this was not one of the eight very good novels in the series so far. Not quite a clunker either - just not up to speed with most of the others. The premise isn't bad, the characters remain strong, and there are sudden turns and thrills. The book just seemed lacking for too many stretches. I've become accustomed to so much more, so this one was a little bit of a let down. Regardless, I'm on to Book 11 before you know it..."
1,Finally giving up on Alex Cross,"It took me 10 books, but I'm finally ready to give up on James Patterson's Alex Cross series. They've gone from great mysteries to unbelievable, international espionage/warfare books. I didn't read ""London Bridges"" immediately after the other 9 and found I had forgotten enough to make it impossible to follow this book. And the character development seemed to completely stop. Then again, maybe something spectacular happens after page 65. I'll never know and don't care any more."
2,A little disappointed....,"I love the Alex Cross series and was really looking forward to reading this book. I was a little disappointed. I gave the book my full attention, but I felt like I had to go back and re-read some sections so that I could follow the storyline....perhaps it was the really short chapters that seemed to flip flop too quickly. The ending wasn't that good and I found it to be a little confusing at times - maybe it was just me. I would compare this book to a Saturday matinee movie....it was okay to fill the time with, but you wouldn't want to see it again or pay full price. Does that make any sense??"
3,1st Patterson Novel,This is my first James Patterson book and I have to say the Alex Cross novel was pretty darn good. The story had a way to keep you interested with all the twist and turns. I will look forward to reading my next Patterson book.
1,WORST CROSS BOOK EVER!,"In this pitiful disapointment of James Patterson, you can find neither excitment nor the psychological intrigue that made Alex Cross a literary icon. The chapters are short and written for those with an attetion span of a two year old child. James Patterson who was my favorite author until this book has failed MISERABLELY! With each book we watched Pattersons writting style change from intese psychological thrillers to this water downed mush that seems to have been written without any imagination or time. If you are an Alex Cross fan DONT READ! It will sour whathad been one of the greatest running character series!"
3,Not His Best,Ive read a couple of the Alex Cross novels and this one is by far the worst. I just kept reading asking myself when is this book gonna end. Everything happens so fast and then its over. I was disappointed in this one. I read Big Bad Wolf first and liked it alot and looked forward to this one but I was let down as were alot of other Patterson fans here. Hopefully his next one will be better.
2,A Waste Of 3 Hours,Please don't let this be the first James Patterson book that you read. They are not all as bad as London Bridges. Along Came A Spider and Kiss The Girls were brilliant.A good 3 hours worth of house cleaning or yard work are a much better investment than reading this book.
3,"Fast, as usual....but where was the psychological expert?","I've begun noticing that there is very little behavioral analysis by Alex Cross anymore. He seems more of an action hero than someone with a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins.This means the plot is driven by coincidences and villains who overexpose themselves because they know they won't get caught.It's still got action to burn, and at least THIS time the villain isn't someone who Patterson has used as a good guy in several previous books.The book was fast-paced, you can read it in one sitting especially if you skip over the boring filler material with his Grandma, his kid who lives away, his ex-wife?, his kids at home, etc. I started skipping all that stuff several books ago, I can't believe Alex Cross doesn't weigh 500lbs. the way he eats."
1,This book is a loser,"When will James Patterson learn that he has been writing too much, dull, boring and well, just losing material?I respect Alex Cross too much to believe in the claptrap.Spare me world terrorist plots.Write what you and Alex know, good cop crime novels, with maybe a little fantasy like Max, remember the flying girl?Gave me chills until the end grossed me out.(The Lake House). I will not pick up another Patterson novel until he changes his ways.Yo, James, my man, you must be rich enough. Take a rest, You need one, or you will lose your readers (me)"
1,Not his best.,"I was surprised and disappointed by this installment of the Alex Cross books. The story was confusing and poorly resolved. There was no depth to the characters and at the end of the book I was not personally invested in the story or the characters. Deaths, bad guys and good guys were incidental. The bad guy impersonators, meant to be red herrings were pointless and contrived. And at the end, I just didn't care."
4,"impossible to put the book down ,March 29,2006","Reviewer:K Dubbs (Strong Island, New York)This book is very thrill seeking. I honestly hate anything that has to do with reading, but this book is something else. If you like action, blood, and gorey, this is the book to choose to read. The main character the Wolf is extremely powerful and dangerous. I like short chapters and this book has two to six pages for every single chapter. this book has about four hundred pages and one hundred and twenty five chapters. Its a great book and is extremely easy to read.you'll never know what the Wolf ha s palnned next."
4,"Good read, not the best","I felt that this was a good, fast reading book. I love James Patterson's short chapters! This was not one of his best books. Needed nore character development. The ending was true James Patterson style though, it leaves you guessing for the next book."
1,Did James Patterson Write This Book?,This book is very boring and out of focus. I was wondering if this book is written by James Patterson.
4,Exciting action.,"Dr. Alex Cross is once again facing his old adversary, the Wolf, but this time, Wolf is joined by another evil murderer, the Weasel. Wolf has threatened to wipe out towns and cities all over the world with the use of portable nuclear weapons and starts by evacuating a small desert town in the US and then wiping it off the face of the earth. He follows this demonstration of his power by doing the same in England, but this time he doesn't evacuate the villagers. He is demanding a ransom in the billions to stop this threat and then proceeds to follow through with his plans. Alex is assigned to the case along with the CIA, FBI and English and French police. It's a real actioner which would make a great movie and finishes with the suggestion of a cliff hanger."
2,inconsistent PLOT....none the less NOT THE WORST....,"OK Patterson has clearly no plot here.........I finished the book and i still dont know WHO exactly was the WOLF.......the book is Predictable and yet it has some shocks.......but again the paper thin plot ruins it.......none the less it is Interesting and holds attention.....But the ENDING was really BAD...........and how the WEASLE story line was ENDED was really CHEAP..........Weasle Deserved better........and so DID wolf!!!i mean there was a moment in the book where i was like ""OH MY GOD! the WOLF Is ------"" but again in the next page Somebody else was WOLF.......i mean Patterson clearly doesnot even know himself who WOLF is.......ahhh i feel cheated.........2.5/5"
1,Horrible,This book was bad. Too many starts and stops in the plot that went nowhere. The author seemed to be in a hurry to finish it. Dont waste your time with this book. My copy is in the dumpster.
2,"Alex Cross has been great, but as James Bond? Nope!","I really enjoyed the previous Alex Cross novels, and while this one was a page-turner, there are a couple of climaxes is this book involving previously met BAD guys, The WolfThe Big Bad Wolf (Alex Cross)and The WeaselPop Goes the Weasel (Alex Cross)that just didn't ring true, and it wasn't any more believable than most spy guy as superhero novels or films. Still Alex Cross has brought me a good deal of enjoyment, and I'd really like to see some better films featuring Cross, hopefully with Colin Salmon(Keen Eddie - The Complete Series) portraying Cross."
3,Not what I expected...,"I enjoy reading James Patterson. I especially love the Alex Cross series, but this last one left me a bit... unsatisfied, we'll say. I really thought that the plot kind of dragged along, not holding my attention for any extended period of time (except, of course, during the short times he spent with little Alex). Now, I understand that if the Wolf didn't do what he did at the end that the book would be much, much longer, but I really thought that it could have been done differently. (I don't want to give away the ending to those of you who haven't read it yet) I think it was too abrupt. I do, however have faith that there will be a great many more adventures for Dr. Cross to come and I'm sure that they won't be as disappointing as this one."
5,how the west was won,"this has to be the best western of all timea huge all-star cast and a tremendous soundtrackspencer tracy narratesoriginally one of the two three strip cinerama featuresa long film that portrays three generations of new americansit is full of adventure and has an outstanding buffalo stampedein cinerama, it was stupendous, but still works on a smaller screen"
3,Is this release cropped 39% to 1.77:1?,"I have seen this film in 3-strip Cinerama projection in 1962 at the Cooper Cinerama theatre in Saint Louis Park, MN, and most recently, in 2008 at the Hollywood Cinerama Dome. While I reccommend the film; I will not add to the already abundant editorial reviews of this film here.This 3-Strip Cinerama film was originally released in a 2:89:1 Aspect Ratio.I notice the reported technical specs say this 2011 Blu-Ray release is in a 1.77:1 Aspect Ratio.Even the 2008 Re-Mastered release is in a 2.55:1 ratio. Has 39% of the wide screen been cropped in this 2011 release?I subtract 2-stars for cropping so much of the image."
5,WOW!!!!!,"WOW!!!! In Blu Ray this special addition is fantastic!Can't wait to have our Grand Children over to learn and see,"" How the West Was Won!!!!!!!GJH"
3,They should of,"How the west was won was a good movie.I first saw it at the Capri theater in Dallas Unfortunately as I would later learn, that this theater had took the three projection system for Cinerama back in 1958.they had reduce the curve screen.what I saw was the 70 mm version.So i never did see the three projection version.I'm also angry that greedy time Warner did not include the smile box version for d.v.d version."
4,Great Movie- Pathetic Transfer,"This is the first (and only) CINERAMA film I ever saw, without doubt the most thrilling aspect of the movie is the grand scale of the Cinerama process and the multi- channel soundtrack. The transfer to DVD is an insult. In this era of digital technology it is easily possible to correct the color balance errors evident in the ""seams"" of this otherwise remarkable motion picture. I agree with other reviewers, lose the Turner promo. The color balance, saturation, and pictureresolution are very average, and fall well below of what the DVD process is capable. One redeeming feature is the soundtrack. Finally, after viewing the VHS tape, and Laserdisc of this movie, the DVD release incorporates the correct rear channel information of the original release. Finally, and most regrettably, this DVD release has been cropped. Don't we buy widescreen movies to see how they were originally shot? HELLO HOLLYWOOD!"
3,Amazon does this with all films,"For those pointing out the reviews of older DVD versions of HWWW being here and much inappropriate, this is ,in my long Amazon experience, normal. Every time I look up a film and read the reviews (if more than one version has been put out) it is pretty much always easy to see the reviews are for all the versions - not just the one specifically listed. Good reviewers might want to be sure to note releasing company and release date in their review to help avoid this problem.Would, though help if Amazon would simply attach only the reviews of a specific release page to that page and not move them to any other release page - but maybe it's more than their computers/program operators can handle."
4,Great film but Ted Turner should be out of the movie biz,"No need to dwell on the film. It's a classic, and rightly so. But the DVD missed a lot of opportunities. Maybe the screen seams could have been fixed. Maybe not. But what's with the cropping?!? No excuse for that. And Ted Turner's logo at the opening is a disgrace. It's a matter defacing a national treasure. It is nothing short of vandalism. Still, the chances of getting a better DVD transfer of this film are pretty slim. I suggest you get it and try to ignore Mr. Turner and his ego."
2,A cinematographic insult,"This is for the blu-ray edition:""How the west was won"" is (or was) the ONLY 3 or 4 146 degrees angle of view Cinerama movies with 2.59:1 aspect ratio.The blue-ray com is listing the aspect ratio of this (so called) ""ultimate restored and remastered"" version as 2.20:1 meaning the studio has stolen the 18% of the width of the movie while restoring.It is impossible to understand why they cant do a full scan while restoring these mile-stone movies. Many studios are scanning the movies at 4k for blue-ray (as it is in the upcoming God Father blue-ray set) so that they will not spend a fortune for restoration when the next 4k format launches. This means, as Warner had a restoration made for this movie at 2.20 now, we will probably not see the original aspect ratio version for a long long time.If the information on Blu-ray com is correct this is a cinematographic insult."
2,Editing is unacceptable,"I cannot count how many times I have watched this movie since it was first released way back when. I saw it in Cinerama and have seen it non-Cinerama. Unfortunately the seams people complain about are inherent in any Cinerama transfer to ""standard"" format. Until a complete digital remastering is accomplished this will be normal.What I did not like about this DVD is that it is edited. Why would a DVD release be edited is beyond me. Similar to the editing of the Alamo, minor pieces being removed are not noticed unless you have seen the film in its uncut version. Editing a DVD release is not acceptable."
3,A pot-boiler: then and now,"""How the West Was Won"": an incorrigible pot-boiler. Like other ""epics"" of the 1960s (eg the Alamo) this movie is a product of Hollywood culture. This is an entertainment genre unto itself. As an example of Hollywood's looking-in-on-itself as a source of material, this movie has charm (but not in the way intended). But if you are looking for any trace of history or American culture, look elesewhere. If you are into Rat-pack era (Sinatra, Monro, Kennedy) pseudo-culture, this is a classic."
3,How the West Was Won (Widescreen Edition) [VHS] Tape,"July 2,2011 Disappointing edition; Contains 2-vertical lines at third-points, as though 3-photographs are side-by side, with the center portion a different hue. I saw this movie at a Cinerama theater in 1964. After only 1 hour of viewing, the content of this classic is still good. I do not know if scenes have been omitted by corporate America. The movie and music industries need to leave the originals alone. See the following link to see photos of this new version. [...]"
2,As Advertised,I should have waited for the enhanced version. The product arrived promptly and was as advertised. M Carter
2,Disappointing for a Recently Initiated Gorey Fan,"I admit, the only other Edward Gorey work I have read was ""The Gashliecrumb (sp?) Tinies"", which I found devilishly hysterical, but this one just left me cold. It was full of amateurish double entendres that lacked the subtlety to make them fun. Instead he just repeatedly referred to the unusual endowment of the male characters. All in all, not at all recommended."
4,"""That which description may never justify""","When I first tried listening to this album, at the age of 19, I found it... intimidating. Its restless energy and bizarre oceans of sound were almost frightening. Because of this I was always fascinated by it, and went back to it over the years until I really got to like it. At times it seems that Miles has achieved something that isn't quite music but isn't non-music either --- ""that which description may never justify."" Those who are accustomed to the jazz styles of the 50s and 60s may find this a tough listen, but it's well worth the effort, for its sheer wildness and reckless courage. A major effort by one of the authentic musical geniuses of the 20th Century."
1,PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT,"Please please please do not use Hartz brand on your pets. It has killed thousands of cats and dogs because of the harmful chemicals (pyrethrins) found in the products. If you would like some proof, go to hartzvictims.org or hartzkills.org."
2,Short term fix,"Prior to applying the product we decided to give our dog the best shot for being without fleas. We bathed him, got a flea collar, and then applied the Hartz product. For a few days after application we saw a reduction in fleas. Then around four days later we started seeing one or two fleas. Assuming they had jumped on from outside and would be killed by the Hartz we shrugged it off. However, after a few more days the number of fleas was going back up. We continued to use the Hartz for another month before finally giving up.The product does not last nearly as long as it states. I am beginning to wonder if the bath prior to the first application had more benefit than the Hartz.We are now using Frontline and are seeing great results."
1,Don't Use this junk,"As an acting ER veterinarian, we see a number of small dogs and cats that have had adverse reactions to these products. The price difference between this product and safe more effective products is no where near what it would need to be to use. Trust me, go with a vet approved, vet supplied product. Even the OTC products like Frontline blow this stuff out of the water. My 2 cents. I try write these reviews when the ER is slow, visit the website for blogs on other topics.Dr Tripp Stewartwww.greenbrier-emergency.com"
4,works good,"no fleas have used for 3 or 4 months and it works great, but be careful and not pile in one place"
1,"Greasy, stinky, itchy","I am horrified after reading some of these reviews. What did I put on my dogs?! One of my dogs (A 25-lb Cav King Charles) doesn't seem to mind the stuff, but it makes his normally beautiful, shiny, silky coat a gross oily mess. My other dog, a 12-lb Yorkie Bichon, goes crazy after we apply it. She runs around like a maniac trying to itch her poor back. I started researching and found all of these awful reviews... I'm going to shell out the extra bucks for oral pills from my vet. This is ridiculous, and I can't believe they're allowed to sell this stuff (after reading other reviews).--I should note that we've never had flea or tick problems, before or after using this product."
3,"Good Story, but slooowwwwww","It took me an extra long amount of time to read this as I had to keep putting it down. It was moving sooo slow and was hard to remain attentive. While I did enjoy about the last 25% of the book and will probablly purchase the 2nd in the series, I'll go into it a little wary. I found this to be a good story over all, well written, well thought out, well researched, but like I said, it was slow. It didn't suck me in to a ""must read"" mindset."
3,Arthur's Eyes,This book was about a boy named Arthur who has to get glasses. The next day at school his classmates and friends for wearing glasses tease him. He starts telling his teacher that he forgot his glasses at home. The lesson this book teaches that it's okay to be different and not to care about what others think of you. The age level of this book is about from ages 5-8. I thought this book was good because all children need to learn that it's okay to be different.
