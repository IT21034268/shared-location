2,Depressing,"I hope that most of the people who do this work don't feel this way. The author was depressed by the repetitive nature of his work, and developed a very cynical view of the public he served."
1,"Lots of information on the air group, not much on the ship","Ranger was the first large, fast fleet carrier built as such by any navy (as opposed to being converted from an existing hull), and the impressive thing is how much her designers got right, despite the limitations on her size because of funding.Unfortunately, Mr. Cressman does not really address how Ranger compared to her peers - or at least the other ""keel-up"" designs - in the IJN (Ryujo and Soryu) and RN (Hermes and Ark Royal); the book is lacking because of it."
2,Good GPS but useless with no power,"Last year I decided to but my wife a GPS for her car. This isn't my first GPS. I already have an automotive one in my car, multiple hand held units along with older units datting back to 1992. I also use one on a daily basis Geocaching.About the GPS:Pros: Touch screen and easy to use with clear instructions.Cons: It's size is a little larger then most of todays units. The cradle isn't very solid. The battery in the unit went down hill from day 1. Only 6 months after installation and very little use the power connection inside the unit just died. The GPS was treated very well and it just died. It now sits all by itself on the shelf waiting for me to repair it or thrown into the electronics recycle pile. I would not purchase one of these units due to the power and battery issue."
5,RoadMate 2000 is a great car navigation GPS,"The Magellan RoadMate 2000 is a great car navigation GPS device. Feature-packed and more affordable than many, this portable GPS allows you to easily move it from one vehicle to another so there's never a reason to not be able to find your way to your destination. The screen has a variety of views and the voice prompts make it easy to navigate when you're driving and can't stop to look at the screen. It isn't perfect. No GPS is. Occasionally it tells you to make a turn or go in a direction that's just plain wrong, but it doesn't happen very often. It's pretty user-friendly even for someone who has never used a GPS device before, so you won't feel like you need a college degree in astro-physics. I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife who has a hard time finding her way to places unless she's been there several times before, and she just love it."
1,do not buy magellan products,"I received a Magellan Roadmate 2 years ago, the unit suggested I update the maps, the maps are now seriously out of date. Tech support said they have no updated maps for such an ""OLD"" unit. They offered a discount on buying a new unit which would have been more expensive than a competitor's new unit. I WILL NEVER BUY MAGELLAN AGAIN"
3,"Not bad for MATLAB, but for DSP get Lyons' book.","Ingle and Proakis' book isn't a bad deal if you have to learn MATLAB and DSP at the same time. There are plenty of MATLAB examples, however, I was disappoined in all the discrepancies between the code listed in the book and the code downloaded from the publisher (Brooks/Cole). Also, as a DSP beginner, I wish I & P had included more diagrams. For newcomers to DSP, Richard Lyons' ""Understanding Digital Signal Procssing"" is still the best book available (in my opinion)."
3,Good but not as good as her others.,Well I was eagerly awaiting this book but after I read it I felt a bit wanting. I have loved all of the other books that I have read by Lynsay Sands. They have been filled with great humor and wonderful plots that had me wanting to call in sick to work just to finish the book in one setting. This one didn't. It took me three days to read. I liked it. It was a good story but the humor wasn't present and it could have been filled with it. The love scenes were ok but not special and the whole plot left a little to be desired. I would still recommend this book but it wasn't one of her best. I'm now going to start her book Sweet Revenge. I hope its better.
5,garlic keeper,I love this garlic keeper. I use to have another one but it was so small that you could hardly put anything in it. This one is very large and is great for keeping several head of garlic. I keep it on my kitchen counter so it's always in reach when I need it.
2,too fragile,"Wonderful size and shape, with a wide mouth so you can easily get cloves in and out. Very fragile. Mine chipped withing hours of having received it. I can't recommend it because of this."
2,buy something else,The lid had a huge crack after the first use. It might still work okay but I haven't had the heart to test it yet.I used the first time on asparagus and it turned out good but not spectacular.

1,If truth did not matter...would be a fine book,"A book that has the potential to do untold damage to orthodox Christianity. The author seems to have little concern for truth. Ethics, apparently, is the only thing that really counts. That might just work this generation. Next generation they'll wonder why they're supposed to do 'this' or 'that' and soon ethics will also be lost. Generosity is good, but let's not be any more generous than Paul was.Murray writes, ""If we sacrifice truth today for short-term influence we cannot guarantee what our conduct will be tomorrow. When the day to fight is postponed the very will to fight may go from us.""On a similar note Lloyd-Jones said years ago, ""The tragedy of the last hundred years has been due to the fallacy of imagining that you could shed Christian doctrine but hold on to Christian ethics."""
4,More Solid than Some Would Suggest,"This is a solid book--much more ""orthodox"" than some of the reviewers would suggest. Maclaren has some good and thoughtful points to make. He examines the point where faith and culture intersect. Christians who remember the apostle Paul's dictum, ""I am become all things to all people that I might by all means win a few"" will find this book an exposition of that idea. I think it is worth reading."
2,Bland & uninteresting,"Unfortunately, this book is bland and not very interesting.I am not sure if the fault with this book is on the part of the author or the reader. McLaren quotes the famous scripture ""to everything there is a season."" He does not take his own advice, at a time when the Body of Christ faces so many challenges, at a time when there is such a need for the Gospel of Christ, McLaren shows almost no passion. I would have preferred much more passion on his part.I understand that McLaren is attempting to reach consensus among the different factions within Christianity, which is commendable. The problem is that he is not more forceful when he sees failures in the church. For example, he correctly points out how some factions depend on creating fear. His criticism of such practices is so weak it is almost non-existent.The book is just not very interesting. Again, there are too many other good books."
1,Sad Commentary,"This book absolutely broke my heart. I think about all the young seekers out there looking for a mosel of truth, looking toward an Emerging Church Leader like Mr. McLaren for teaching, and then being let down once again. I talked with non-believer friend of mine who read the book - he absolutley loved it - he remarded that this book was a sigh of relief in that he is confident that he is saved, no matter what he believes. This book is leading people astray and that is really a painful thing to see. If you are not a mature Christian that can discern between God's Truth and Satan's ingenious and subtle deception, I would be very cautious of this book. It is packed with half-truths - one can almost hear Satan tempting Eve in the garden and Jesus in the dessert as you read through this absolute philosophical dribble. Mature Christians should read this book so they can be aware of what they'll be coming up against as they spread the Good New of Jesus Christ."
2,Fascinating but flawed,"There is wisdom,humor and wit aplenty here, but I take strong issue with the author's ahistorical and surprisingly narrow assessment of the Pharisees. What he says about them echoes NT polemic as if it's 100% fact, and shows an apparent lack of contact with the mountains of scholarship by writers of varying religions that presents them in a far more nuanced, less monolithic, and even positive way. I've read enough about them to know he's way of course there, and when a writer gets something like that so wrong, it makes me wonder what else he might be misrepresenting in areas I don't know as well."
1,Confusing,"A Generous Orthodoxy was recommended reading for a bible study group. But instead of being informative and challenging, it was a mish-mash of incoherent thoughts with no theological background whatsoever. Everyone in class felt the same way. A few (very few) chapters were ""okay"" but after the first two sessions, I merely brought the book with me to class - unread - and got more out of discussions in class than I did from the book."
1,Deciphering Cryptography,"I have the hardest time with muddled thought's misreasoned lines that can't connect the dots. This is what passes for Christology? Give me somebody else's heresy. The old kind, not one that's just been released in sheepskin camouflaging the wolfbeast."
1,Doesn't cut it; insults the Bible and Christian intelligence,"This thing is overrated at one star.Sandtrap-filled golf, it triple-bogey's par.All Christians with intelligence can seeSuch propaganda needs real proof to beBelievable. True Christ-disciples senseWhat this pulp preaches doctors evidence,Twisting the Bible into pretzel dough.Heed Jesus' words which tell false prophets 'Whoa!'"
1,Won't be buying again,"This has been my number one all time favorite candy for years but I won't be buying it again. They've changed the formulation and it's no longer any good. I'm sure the change was dollar motivated and, guess what, they won't be getting any more of MY dollars."
5,Love this!,"This licorice is the most delicious I have ever tasted. It is soft and chewy, but not too chewy. It is not too sweet. It is sweetened with molasses instead of refined sugar or high fructose corn syrup. It is a great deal. When I buy it at the grocery store locally, I pay double the price that amazon offers this box. The only problem with having a box of black licorice in my pantry is that I want to eat one every day!"
5,Excellent pure old fashioned flavor,This is an excellent old fashioned snack with pure flavors. A great pick me up and folks that say they dont like licorice adore this!
2,poor photo quality,"It's only redeemingly quality is the price (if you get a good deal). Photo quality is poor, and screen is quite small (3x5). Navigation is not overly complicated, but buttons must be pushed hard to work. It did work perfectly fine - took SD card, even connected to my Mac and drag and drop photos onto the SD card I inserted into the frame. But, because of the poor quality of the photos, I don't suggest buying."
3,"Not bad, but not great either!","Initially, I was pleased with the purchase, since it was a super cut-rate price and I personally LIKED the utensils that everyone else has scoffed at. My disappointment started with the dutch oven, when 1st time out of the plastic wrap and it's one time use boiling crabs, one of the handles snapped in half. Poor quality, poor inspecting, poor testing on this cookware? I will leave that up to the discriminating buyer. My thought is that for a family that does not cook a great deal or for myself, a single fellow, it is not bad cookware, but there are some disappointments that should not be experienced by any of us. The handle on a new piece of cookware breaking first time out should be on that list!"
4,Great buy!,"I would recommend this buy anytime it pops up in your Gold Box! It is above average low-cost cookware, it is heavy and comes with great clear glass lids! Also, the kitchen utensils and holder are nice stovetop accessories, although I would not use them on the non-stick surfaces! Beware, though, the only nonstick items are the skillets! The Dutch oven and sauce pans are not non-stick, but a good dose of non-stick spray before cooking does the trick! The ""mixing"" bowls should be used for storing left-overs, not mixing, and they come with great lids! This is one of my best buys ever, and it is well worth the money and free shipping to boot! I can't believe people are complaining when they paid less than $40 for it!"
4,pretty good deal,"This set is a great deal, I was a little disappointed that the fry pans were teflon and not stainless steel but over all. Wonderful deal! I'm cooking a big pot of Chili in one right now."
3,"Useful, but overly specific","I like the memory work and the grammar in this book. My girls have learned alot of poems by heart and they can tell you the definitions of the nouns and verbs etc. I don't like, however, that each lesson is dragged out for so long. My kids started this book at the ages of 4 and 6 last year and are still using it, though less frequently now. They really don't need a week or more to learn each lesson, so we skip alot in this book. I also don't like the re-done versions of certain classics like the ""Sunday's Child"" poem. So we looked up the original online to teach them instead."
3,Might be a little slow but...,"I bought this book as an English grammar curriculum for my homeschooled Kindergartener and 1st grader. I am starting a little late in the school year (summer after these years have been completed) so it seems to be a bit of a slow start. For those familiar with the classical approach to education, this book suits the bill, which is why I will choose to remain patient and take it lesson by lesson. Parts of speech are defined clearly, giving children an easy sentence to set to memory. Exercises are thorough. And each lesson takes about 15 minutes. I would recommend this book for early grammar mainly because I have no doubt that the lessons are set to build a solid foundation for writing in the later years."
5,Short and stout teapot. Perfect for loose leaf tea.,"The Bodum Assam Teapot is attractive, sturdy, and easy-to-clean. In particular, I like the way the tea basket is designed, with no holes on the bottom third. This makes it possible for the tea basket to have much larger ""vents"" without introducing much sediment to the tea, making it easier to clean than the typical baskets which use very fine metal mesh."
2,Useless without infuser,"I bought this teapot so I could enjoy the Primula tea flowers I purchased at the same time. Since I wanted to see the tea ""blossom,"" I left out the infuser. It turns out the lid is too small to cover the pot if the infuser is removed; it falls in. Not exactly what I was going for. Leaving the lid off leads to cold tea. A very disappointing product from a well-known name in teapots."
4,Prison Reform,"This book is a simple biography of a late 19th century prison reformer, Elizabeth Fry. Elizabeth's work among female prison inmates is told via the experiences of a young girl who, along with her brother, lives through the trials of life in London in Victorian England when poor and uneducated. Elizabeth Fry is a Quaker, and shares her religion and Scriptures with the prison inmates, but the book (and Mrs Fry) refrain quite nicely from being ""preachy"" while doing so. The book is definitively Christian, unquestionably moralistic, and could lead to discussions with youthful readers regarding the purpose of prisons and how justice, punishments, and what is considered criminal behavior have changed over time."
4,good sequel,"a very good sequel, bloody, funny, and entertaining. not as good as the first but still a good effort. will we see an afro samurai three?"
3,Kinda falls short,The first Afro took 10 years to create and its awesomeness shows it. This one seems more like a hurried wannabe trying to rake in some more cash off of the name. Not to say that its not top notch animation but it feels weak and was a bit boring at times. I wish I would have rented this instead of buying it.
4,A value scent,"Cabotine by Parfums Gres isn't an expensive scent, yet it lasts, isn't too strong, nor too sweet. A good daytime choice for those that use scent daily."
3,useful,Easy to carry in pocket or purse. Good to have for a snack. Flavor needs to be improved. Taste is not bad just could be great if they changed it a little.
5,great female voices,"Well, after boys don't cry there is another great soundtrack with amazing female singers! My absolute favourte track is ""free"" from the new australian singer Marie Wilson. If you like Melissa Etheridge - CHECK HER OUT - wonderful artist! There's again Sarah McLachlan's ""ice cream"" on a soundtrack - but no wonder - it's wonderful track! There are also artists I don't know, but the songs are cool: Kacy Crowley, Sinead Lohan! My favourite songwriter Diane Warren wrote ""Leaving's not leaving"" performed by LeAnn Rimes... BUY THIS CD! IT'S THE BEST YOU CAN GET RIGHT NOW!"
5,"Touching Movie, Touching Soundtrack","Anywhere But Here is a film starring Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon (two of my faves). The movie is about the ups and downs in a relationship between a mother and a daughter, and this soundtrack represents just that. Filled with young and recent female singers (symbolizing the daughter) and past famous female singers (symbolizing the mother). All the songs in this cd are sang by great female artists, including Lisa Loeb, Sarah MchLachlan, Poe, and lots more. Every song reminds me of the wonderful movie. If you enjoyed watching this movie, you will enjoy listening to the music...I promise."
2,"TIRED of ""Inanna""","I loved it for the jumping off point I took it to be. Names to look up and read about. Very interesting very short biographies. But I can't tell you how early in the book I was wincing on reading the name ""Inanna"" yet again. Inanna is everywhere in this book, there was barely a page that doesn't mention her. If not for how much steam I built against that one peeve, the book would have gotten a far better rating. Petty, I know, but there's my opinion."
4,Super Girly,"We all love this hat. My daughters love the colors, the soft pink fabric, feathers, sparkles and lettering. I love that it looks so good in pictures and the secret pocket is perfect for a special note from Mom or the start of a treasure hunt. The hidden adjustable size tab is great for all ages. Even at their first birthday, the lack of snugness didn't interfere with the look or function."
3,Not bad -- a quick read,"This is neither a great nor bad book on the subject of change management. It is written in a succinct way and is therefore a quick read. If you are reading a number of texts on the subject, you won't go wrong adding this one to the list, but make sure you read some others alongside it. It does make a number of good points (particularly about senders and receivers of messages), but the examples aren't as powerful as other texts I have read."
1,Not what it seems. At all!,"I will honestly say that this item is not worth the price. Sure, it comes with a couple lens adapters, but the usefullness ends there.Using this lens involves attaching the adapter to the lens, then attaching the unit onto your camera lens.While it does offer the fisheye effect to some sort, you have to use a very low zoom (no higher than 35mm) to actually see the effect. Once you do that, you will notice black stuff in your pictures, kind of like looking at something through a pieve of black paper with a pinhole in it.And don't even think about using flash with it, as you'll see the shadow of the lens in your pictures.All in all, it's a huge waste of money. If you have a camcorder, and a couple more lens adapters, I'm pretty sure you can get some use of it. That's what I'm planning to do once I find the size I need for my Sony Digital8 video cam."
3,buny-in-the-headlights,"i liked this movie, although i have to admit there is probably not enough action to hold the interest of today's younger audiences, it is still a very enjoyable movie"
3,It had a positive message,"The movie was short and typical urban adventure, but I liked the message that Little Romeo gave in his presentation about Decisions. Depending on our taste in movies, the rest of the movie can be judged as you see fit. I purchased this for less than $3, so I'm not complaining, but it's not worth much more than that. . It's just my opinion."
4,a must see,"treat this film as a fiction and not a historic epic of genghis khan and you'll hv no problem. just to see a young omar shariff in action is worth it! his temujin is truly compelling. and now i understand why stephen boyd was also the 'bad guy' in BENHUR. for those who hv not seen this production and are into films as in gladiators, alexanda and such like would find this an enjoyment. hope someone could reproduce this into a dvd or make more copies of it."
4,Somebody better do a reprint on this one!,"I think it would sell well. In my humble opinion this version of Genghis Khan's life, while probably inaccurate historically, is the best one made. It got the main point of this Conquerers life across with splendid costume, scenery, and action. It had a really honest personal combat scene in which one of the antagonists actually got kicked in the reproductive sector. Real blood and sweat! The only thing missing was Horse Archery.Please bring it back!? I want a new copy of it."
3,GENGHIS KHAN - ENTERTAINING AFTERNOON MOVIE,"This 1965 hollywood production of GENGHIS KHAN, with it's obvious historical alterations was an entertaining afternoon movie (despite portraying the title character (Omar Sharif) as a sympathetic figure) and the picture quality is crisp and sharp. There's a great roster of stars in this film that include: James Mason, Eli Wallach, Telly Savalas, Stephen Boyd, Francoise Dorleac, Robert Morley. James Mason is hilarious as the chinese character ""Kam Ling"" with his too obvious 'false' buck teeth! All in all, this historical pagaent (filmed on location in Yugoslavia) makes for a great saturday afternoon romp.Closed Captioning is not included for the hearing impaired.3.5 Stars"
1,VERY displeased!,"Viewing the picture of this item, I was expecting get a mouse, cradle/charger and USB transmitter. I placed my order and all there is in the box is a handset with no charger and no USB transmitter! Thinking perhaps I clicked the wrong item, I came back to Amazon and searched for this item, and low and behold, there is the same photo showing the transmitter as part of the package. Reading closely, the description on the bottom says ""handset"".Very sucky! Can't even use the thing..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,This item is just a mere plastic 'copy' model. It does not come with ANY accessories to make it work. The company are very unhelpful when I called to try and sort it out. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.
4,"Good story, and an inventive plot","Greg Bear gives the reader a ""new"" approach to the genre. His use of todays (a bit dated now) conflicts spinns us in a tale of distrust and cooperation. As the story progesses, i was suprised to the changes that happened in the book. The use of a ""paralell world"" is familliar enough, but the way it is told in this book is unfamilliar. Even to a seasnoned Sci-Fi reader, Bear continues to suprise with his inventive plot and progress of story"
5,A standard candle.,"EON had the greatest magnitude of plot acceleration this reviewer has ever seen. Its Cold War, dipole rhetoric, refreshing in this monopole age of asymmetric ""terrorism"", is hardly obsolete but waits for China to rouse. The characters are 2D+ and textured, the space combat chilling and tense, the depiction of future cultures sobering, the depiction of ""The Way"" staggering, the handling of hard science concepts very competent. This reviewer recalls no unjustified or inexplicable fancy - everything was nailed together very well. For those who fear Zaphod Beeblebrox's experience in the Total Perspective Vortex, EON's last chapter with Pavel Mirsky is not for you."
3,"Not the best, but...","I bought one of these a couple of years ago and I'm buying a new one. It isn't as non-stick as it should be and it isn't all that easy to clean. But it's small and a heck of a lot easier to clean than those monstrosities that come with most stoves. Yes, it could have more drainage holes, but the deep groves help keep fat from the food. All in all, this is a fair product."
1,Nonstick properties - or rather lack thereof,"I liked this pan because it was a good size for two people. However, I did not like it's nonstick properties, or rather lack thereof. I had to soak and scrub, and soak and scrub, every time I used it and it was still dirty! So, I've been hating it, but trying not to throw it away. The pan underneath had some kind coating that been slowly peeling off. I'm glad I don't use that for cooking. Finally I cooked a meal that I could not get off and that was that, into the trash it went."
1,Very disappointed,"With the drain holes just along the sides, there is not enough room for this pan to drain the fat as the meat is broiling. My kitchen gets filled with smoke instead. Do not buy this as a broiling pan."
3,Okay for Brahms lovers,"I'm not a Brahms fan, but heard some of these pieces in concert and actually enjoyed them. The recording is okay, lacks the luster of a live performance, but is pleasant. If you're not a fan of Brahms it might sound dull."
1,Mixed opinion,"What can I say. The game was nearly the worst PC game I have ever played. It was a ""Port"" game and the controls were keymapped to ""Awkward"" right out of the box. Game play was simplistic and most of the humor was forced.I beat the game in about 4 hours. Not a lot of content.Now while I was playing there was always the hint of what the game could have been. Maybe somebody up the product chain had a vision that got molested before it got to retail, dunno. There were a few moments that had potential. The UFO thing was funny and totally well set-up before it attacked. Brief as it was, that was a good moment. Some of the animations are worth looking at if you like BBW.So even for $5.99 the game really isn't worth the money unless you just like to burn through cheap, bad games in your spare time."
2,"The Tycoons: How Andrew Carnegie, etc","I stuggled through the first half of the book, but then just gave up. Not at all what I expected, would not recommed it."
4,ranch vacations,Overall it was very informative. The categories were well laid out for comparison. There were a few ranches that were not included so I had to rely on their own websites. Kilgore makes you want to get out on the ranch immediately. We are looking forward to our first ranch vacation. Kilgore made the choice easier for sure.
3,1st time rail rider,"The book contains useful information drawn from experience. Good pictures. Not really a ""Sandrail"" book. Very good advice given by the author when talking about the engine. Would have liked to see more engine diagrams. The book is a bit dated-1983."
3,Minor but passable,"This production never quite overcomes its straight-to-video quality, but it's well cast -- even in the smaller parts -- and sticks to its plot in an efficient though unimaginative way. Praise goes to the writers and director, as well as to Sam Elliott himself, for refusing to make Elliott's character likeable or ""misunderstood."" Also thanks for giving Elliott a bare-chest scene. Even at age 51 (or thereabouts) he still looks good when he strips to the waist and shows off a torso that's never been subjected to a make-up artist's razor."
4,Great product!,The purchase price on this item was a deal which I could not pass. Our family of six loves the griddle. No more waiting for pancakes! Cooked a whole pound of sliced bacon at once. Grilled sandwiches come out perfectly golden brown and delicious. Remember to cook on a lower heat setting than you are probably used to using. Non-stick is easy clean-up. Only drawback is you have to be careful with the nonstick surface as it seems to scratch easily.
1,"Big disappointment,more about witchcraft than cats/romance","I happen to like sweet and funny romances including animals as pets, but this book was a huge disappointment. For instance, the stories included one about a cat who was a person/witch in cat form, caused by a spell from an evil woman. It was ridiculous to me. This book was more about fantasy/witchcraft than about cats. I found it to be disturbing overall, as it was more scary/unpleasant than it was romantic. In other ways it just seemed silly. I am not opposed to stories about witchcraft,in general, but these stories seemed to be more about spells and evil-doers than about romance and kitties. Not my ""cup of tea."" I discarded this one."
5,Friends,This is a great boxed set full of extra scenes and all the episodes. Other friends dvd's have some episodes but not all like this one. I just wanna say i cant wait until seasons 4-9 come out.
4,America's legendary extreme gods!,"I think this band from upstate New York never gets a fair shake. I mean nobody seems to run to them until their shocked to hear them! This band is amazing! The vocalist ""Storm"" has to have the best range in black/death metal period! The man is amazing! His howling and growling makes this band! The mix is a bit weird in someways or I'd given it a 5 star. ""Winter Eve"" is mystical mayhem, ""In Darkness, I dwell"" is a classic of mood shifting torture! ""Heaven's Damnation"" has some nice bass riffing under Storm's declaration of war on heaven with searing riffs this song they started to write early on for some reason took years to put it out and well worth it! I say buy them it's worth the price for an original and classic extreme metal band the usa has neglected to support!"
1,"luv groban, hate album","This one was a disappointment. I thought I purchased an entire album, not just 2 songs. A total bummer.I luv Groban, as I have many of his selections. But to pay full pop for 2 songs, they are on another CD, that I bought at the same time."
1,Misleading Do not buy this,This is very misleading. It is not an album but 1 song. I intend to ask for my money back. This is not a comment on Josh Groban but on this album whcih is a farce.
5,A must have book,"Always keep this book within arms reach. Not for the inexperienced. If you know Domino Administration and know how to use this book, it can be your bible. Everyone on my team has one on their bookshelf."
3,Be wary of knock-offs from obscure sellers,"I purchased one of these cards from an obscure seller in the Amazon marketplace (purchase not fulfilled by Amazon directly). Since the price was very low I was suspecting something wasn't right. Given the super discount I decided to take a risk. The product arrived quickly and appeared to be authentic. It worked well, but the speed did not meet my expectations. My standard memory card performed just as fast. I have several other High Speed cards from less notable brands that, by comparison, do perform better. So I tend to question the authenticity of my purchase, though you couldn't tell by looking at the product. Still, for what I paid it was a good value."
2,Not the Best,I was dissappointed in this DVD. Mr. Reed acted like he really did notwant to play. Both of these men are great and talented guitar players butsomething was missing in this program. The video and audio were also dissappointing.
4,Little Known Welsh Gem,"Somewhat capricious in nature, commercial success never graced Quicksand, a Welsh outfit whose sole LP plays better than many discs that were well received.Home Is Where I Belong consists of 8 quality plays with each track steeped in rich melody and harmonies. Although progressive, the album is not dominated by keyboards. In fact, the balanced inter-play between guitar and keyboards is one the LP's strongest points... discreet use of mellotron adds to the appeal. Sunlight Brings Shadows is representative.Though hardly a siker, the two most potent tracks, Seasons ~ Alpha Omega and Overcome the Patterns ~ Flying, are not without some welcome flashes of lysergia. Home Is Where I Belong may not be 5 star but it's certainly spinworthy."
5,My New Fave Topcoat,"Shiny! Dries fast! Some other fast-dry topcoats are thick and cause nail polish to streak. This topcoat goes on nicely! Hasn't chipped after 4 days. Also, it does not contain formaldehyde, tuolene, or DBP."
5,Best Topcoat Ever !! <3,This topcoat is amazing cause as soon as it dries it is seriously hard to the touch and has a nice finish what it don't like is that after awhile of use it gets very stringy and makes a mess and it gets hard to place on my nails.
2,Close to expiration,I returned this item before trying it because it was received a month before the expiration date - be careful!
3,Not as good as advertised.,Maybe I was expecting more than what the product can do..But I can't tell any differencein my wrinkles and this is the second tube I have used. Consumer report said it was better than 6 others they tested but none do what they say they will do. That's why I tried it. Don't waste your money.
1,No effects.,It says it reduces dark circles. Well it did not. In fact it did not notice any effects. I am still too young for wrinkles and puffy eyes. I just bought it for my dark circles and no results.
2,A-Z Encyclopedia of Serial Killers,"This encyclopedia of true psychopaths could have been much better. Although it covers a wide range of serial killer information like black widows, bluebeards, and various motives it never goes in depth. By mid-way through the book it becomes repetitive and boring. Schechter's method of writing is the only thing that saves the book, but in turn he does skip over details of praticular cases. I suggest that you read The encyclopedia of Serial Killers by Michael Newton, for more detail book with a lot more information."
2,I've read better articles in the Weekly World News,"The High Points: AlphabeticalThe Low Points: Articles, Factual Information, Overly Brief Synopsis of People... etc.Avoid unless you like reading the ""cliff notes"" of serial killers"
4,the a-z encyclopedia of serial killers,"I thought this book was very fascinating, in fact i couldn't put it down. It covers lots of information without boring you, however i did find it repetative. I would recommend it to anyone especially if you don't already know a lot about serial killers"
5,Fantastic!,"The perfect book for those who haven't got the time to read entire books on individual serial killers, ""The A-Z Encyclopedia..."" has a small and concise, but informative biography on all of the most notorious serial killers that are known, as well as articles on the subjects that have interested them. Plus, there are articles on the impact that serial killers have had on society, including artists, cinema, music, literature, and folklore. If you are looking for a book that details almost all aspects of serial killers, that is packed full of easily digestable facts that you can refer back to when needed, then look no further."
5,Schecter. Finally a researcher what does his homework.,"Schecter's books, based on my independent fact checking, pan out. What a rare treat in this field overrun by quick-buck hustlers and former cops shading history. Definitely recommended for serious scholars."
3,Item as described,"I was not sure what to expect from a beginning seller, especially since I've never bought from an independent Amazon seller. However, I am pleased with my bargain. I believe the condition of the book was the only information that was given. I was not sure what to expect as other copies being sold described the condition of the cover, binding, pages, and writing or lack thereof. As it was the only book without these features I didn't want I decided to buy it and hope for the best. The main thing I was hoping for is that the binding was in tact. When it arrived I was happy to find the binding was secure. I have found some writing/highlighting, a sticker on the spine, and the ""B"" in ""Beyond"" in the title was torn off, but I don't mind. For the price, I'm content with my purchase."
2,Good not godlike,"I would actually say two and half just to put it dead center of the scale. Not as good as, say, Halloween Man but certainly worth a weekend trip. That said I must say that some of the passages struck me as alittle distant if not clumsy. Sort of like Jay Bonasinga. However I did find that the fusions between interior thoughts and exterior action to be solid and sleek. Personally the high point of the book is the wild party from hell that caps the whole story for me. One final thing - How come Crowley is like the modern horror McGuffin? I read somewhere that this book was excellently researched but name-dropping doesn't equal research. This is like the third book in a row I read with Crowley references and this has the weakest connection to actual fact. The guy was a ""kook"" not Satan incarnate! Don't believe the hype."
2,murder in the forecast,The story was ok. I felt like I was reading a Nancy Drew or a Bobsy Twins book. It feels like it was written for an audience of 10 or 12 years old.
3,"Delicious, but something I can make myself","My husband ordered this since I am especially fond of the booze cakes that are sold at Trader Joe's during the holidays. It was very moist, appropriately rummed up, and quite good, but there are really easy recipes online for the same cake. From now on, I'll just make my own."
2,was not that good,if you go to Cayman Island the rum cake is much better--this is just an other very average product in a fancy wraper--
1,Tartuga Rum Cake,"A disappointment. A very bland ""pound"" cake with a little rum flavor. Too bad that the product was not equal to the packaging."
1,Why Bother?,"There is little in this volume that isn't covered more completely (and objectively) in the John Clute/Peter Nicholls Encyclopedia of Science Fiction. If you only have the space or money for one book, this isn't the one."
2,a strange and absurd story,"There are three persons who talk about their past. But the point is that they don't really talk about old times. Everyone tells things that happened in the past and no one knows if they are true. Those things have no context. They are a lot of sexual hints by Deeley. Also strange is that Deeley didn't tell his wife that he already knows Anna. We don't recommend this book because we didn't understand well the sense of the story. In this story you have to read between the lines, and it could happen that even then you are not able to understand the play."
4,I want my AAA!,"Against All Authority's new split with The Criminals, Exchange, is fantastic. The whole CD is hyper and explosive, and is one of AAA's best efforts to date. The new version of ""All Fall Down"" is wild, and even better than the old one. I hope all up and coming AAA releases are as electric and addictive as this one, because it's simply perfection. The reason I marked it down a star is because the CD's so short, you'll want to listen to more than is on there."
1,Absolute Dreck,"Having read quite a few biographies of Fanny Crosby, as she is one of my 'heroes of the faith,' I would recommend the new book by Blumhofer, or the old standby by Bernard Ruffin. This book, by Darlene Neptune, isn't worth the paper it's printed on."
4,Useful for cooking small items,We use this small plate to cook french fries and small items. It works well. We have not tried it as a steack platter.
2,They don't make 'em like they used to.,I needed a knockout set and worked with a bunch of guys who had Greenlee sets from ages ago. So naturally thats what I bought. After less than a year and probably less than 50 knockouts the ratchet started malfunctioning. The teeth had gotten so rounded off that the lock wasn't engaging so it would slip constantly. Luckily I was within the warranty period.Then recently I was working with another guy 2 years later and he had just bought this same set. He was having the same problem. These are made in Taiwan now as are most of Greenlee's tools. If I had it to do over again I'd get the Klein set. Cheaper and made in the USA.I've seen many broken Greenlee tools over the last couple of years. Their quality has taken a nosedive.
5,Bread came out perfect,This really makes a difference in baking bread. The crust came out very really nice and brown. I will probably never buy artisanal bread from those overpriced french bakeries ever again.
2,Inferior to other National Geog Titles,Not fit to have the National Geographic logo on it. Not very educational with limited factual info in it.
4,Four Stars for Your Viewing Pleasure,"The photography is superb, and the action and sound are enough to keep viewers of all ages engaged. As an Imax movie, this is designed for the eyes and ears, and towards those goal, it provides a great experience. Don't purchase this with an expectation of learning much about history, however. While the general course of the expedition is followed, the short length of the film severely limit the needed details to describe the journey."
4,Great Visuals; Shallow Story,"This DVD is only 40 minutes long. The visuals are tremendous, and the historical reconstruction detail is excellent. But telling the story of a 2.5 year adventure in 40 minutes makes for a shallow treatment of the actual story. Read ""Undaunted Courage"" if you want to know more detail."
5,Textbook/great shape,"Very good service, book in great shape. Great savings for a new college student. Would do business with again. Thank-you!"
3,2 much of Jazze Pha,"Is it me, or is Jazze Pha on every other song?Too short maintains his classic style, I just wish he had put more worthwile Collaborations,..Since when does Too short need collabos anyway? Overall, Its the typical short album, with whack producing; title song is the only worthwile listen"
5,Possibly the greatest Court room drama,"This two-part episode of the legendary TV series, Studio One, stars Ralph Bellamy and William Shatner as defense lawyers who defends an accused murder played by Steve McQueen. I think this is probably one of the great courtroom dramas ever made. For once it's not about if the defendant is guilty or not guilty, it's about taking the path you choose in a court of law. Bellamy is convinced from the start that Mcqueen is guilty of murder and though he continues to defend him, he can't bring himself to believe his innocence. Surprisingly the tension and drama all comes from Bellamy and Shatner, they are a father and son who clearly never saw eye to eye. Shatner believe's McQueen is innocent and though he never really convinces his father it's the prosecutor who tells him that you can't think of guilt or innosence, you just have to do your job because it's your profession. Today's courtroom dramas aren't like this that operates on this clear logic."
1,Not all its cracked up to be...,"...- I bought the book BUT Nikki Ross gives a basic three-step approach to investing, that is repeated throughout the book. 1. Collect info, 2. Analyse info, 3. Make a decision. And that's about as complex as the book gets.Don't waste your money, unless you're after a very simplistic overview of investing. ALL OF THE FIVE STAR REVIEWS OVERRATE THIS BOOK - 1 Star (at best)....If you're after real value on practical management implementation tools that link strategy & financial numbers then YOU HAVE TO INVEST IN ""Performance Measurement & Control Systems for Implementing Strategy"" by Robert Simons."
2,lame,"THis is just an OK topper... What's good about it:1. it's alrightBad:1. the nonstick surface is not very good and consequently it is not any easier to clean than a stainless topper2. It warps terribly even under moderate temperature (e.g., 400) creating uneven cooking. To its credit it returns to shape after cool off, but this kind of stinks3. The hole placement is not optimal for draining so you end up with pooled juice which is both annoying and a fire hazard.So overall just OK"
2,A poor followup,"at first this game was actually pretty cool, but then it turned into a kiss a**,gay game,thats the exact truth!but i got to you tell the game its self has a really cool storyline,i mean whats not to like about tring to face of agianst an ancient beast(the dahaka),and while trying to recall yourself through time to try and destroy the sands of time(title of the 2nd game,just so you know this the 3rd).the game starts out to try and let you slice through some kind wierdo,poorly designed idiots.yeah the game lets you use a sub weapon(they are all the same!)+ the game only has like 5 main weapons that really sucks,oh lets see the games are graphics are (suprisingly)pretty good,those character models?i dont know what to call them.the game actually has some really cool fatalitys,moves and evasive manuvers.so i suppose this game is ok for a while.but i hope you have 90 day warranty."
4,generation kill or gen x killers,the frightening thing is that these individuals will be let loose on the streets of america when released from service. one would hope that suitable deprogramming occurs before that happens. PTSD is less likely to be a problem with this crew who have been brought up zapping enemies on electronic game toys etc and suitably desensitised in so doing. where to for gen Y? I am an ex-serviceman (Australian Army 1965-1997).
5,Must buy book,"I am a 12-year veteran of the Marine Corps and was in Beirut with two different infantry Battalions. I am not a fan of the Iraq war and I despise George Bush. However I am still very connected to the Marine Corps and follow their activities. This book is a must have for anyone interested in the Marine Corps or the Iraq war. Its an excellent first hand account of raw combat. For the big picture buy ""The March Up""."
5,Stories The General Public Does Not Hear,"I had mixed feelings about the book based on other's review. I was even hesitant of purchasing the book. But don't let others review stop you. This was a very good book. It does not matter if you are pro war or against. The author dose an awesome job in taking you into the life of each soldier, how they are characteristically, their point of view of the war, how they react to the scenes, missions, etc.For me, the book brought me to tears and moments of laughter. And it does a good job to not leave any un-answered questions. Because the Author added a follow-up, as far as what path each soldier decided to take at the end of their tour.I do recommend this book. I would also recommend any other book that is related to the stories of soldier in battle, because they are the stories that the general public does not have the opportunity to hear."
5,"""Collateral Damage"" Put Into Human Terms","The lure of this book was the incongruity of a Rolling Stone reporter embedded with a unit of U.S. Marines. Beyond this curiosity, I found an excellent piece of journalism -- the author reports the facts and does not put any political spin on them. He clearly develops a fondness for the marines he accompanies but does not sugarcoat the grim work they have to do.The hardest-hitting parts of the book for me were the graphic and matter-of-fact descriptions of what the Pentagon calls ""collateral damage"". After reading this book, I will never again have illusions about America's ability to use force without causing widespread suffering among the surrounding civilian population.A good read about men at war."
4,"Great read, highly recommended for history or war buffs or those looking for a new perspective on the Iraq war","A true story, a reporter journies with a squadron of Marines through Iraq when the war was first starting and everyone thought that it would be an ""in and out"" quick job. This is the book from which the HBO series Generation Kill (Starring Alexander Skarsgard) was based. A great read and an interesting look at the war from the perspective of those fighting it and some of the functions of their units out in the field - the stuff you don't see on CNN."
4,The more things change,"This account of 21st century warfare demonstrates that the more things change, the more they seem the same. Reading Wright's observations of Marines in Iraq reminds me of other books from other wars, such as ""With The Old Guard at Pelelieu"" in the Pacific or ""One More Hill"" from Korea. Obviously, the geography and the equipment are different, but the bonding among soldiers in combat has been a constant. We've seen many of Wright's characters before--the dedicated professional, the career opportunist, the young guys eager to show their stuff. The one aspect missing from many earlier accounts, especially in the Pacific of WW II, is interaction with civilians, many becoming tragic casualties in the confusion and fear of combat. It would have been interesting to learn whether superior officers corrected some of the more noteworthy problems (especially with poor unit-level leaders) but perhaps that's a story for another book."
5,A must read.,Difficult to digest the reality of war but Evan Wright does a good job of not sugar coating the realities.
2,What's all the hype?,Simply: As a former Marine who's 'been there' I was disgusted with this book. Really can't add anything else because i don't want it to be more intruiging than it is.
1,Does he know where Camp LeJeune is?,"I haven't finished the book yet - and I'm happy to say that instead of buying it, I got it from the library. The copy I have is hardback, published by Penguin, and frankly, I'm debating whether or not to continue, based on the fact that on page 86 in my edition, he describes the Tarawa Marines as having come from Camp LeJeune, SOUTH Carolina. Whether this is the author's mistake or a fact-checker's oversight, Camp LeJeune, as anyone with a brain and the ability to use the internet or a map knows, is in NORTH Carolina. Mistakes such as these make me question every single aspect of this ""reporter's"" ""reporting."""
4,U.S. listeners are missing out!,"This release of Casino (ASIN B00006EXC2) is the U.S. Edition containing 15 tracks, six of which are remixes. Alcazar is a fun, disco-like group, and the remixes on this disc reinforce this image. But to make room for the mixes, they removed six original tracks--some of which happen to be pretty interesting (like the great beat of ""Stars Come Out At Night""). So you don't miss out, I suggest you get the UK Edition of Casino instead (ASIN B00005PJJN). Then, if you want all the remixes, buy this U.S. Edition or buy the individual single CDs where the remixes came from."
1,Awful,"Alcazar have that same ridiculous something that once made Army Of Lovers so unapealing in the first place . If looks and work out is your thing then this is your band . If you actually looking for something to listen as well , look elsewhere ."
4,"Interesting experience, dude needs a proof reader","I love the book, but the bad spelling and poor sentence construction grate on me. They give the book an air of BS, although, personally, I believe ZOE7 is telling an authentic story."
3,Scholastic Use,"This video is a very good educational tool -- we used it for a class presentation. There are very inspirational and touching moments, however, it takes a while to get to the meaty portion of the video. The beginning is very dry and the movie takes a while to get moving."
4,"Excelent game, but...","The game is excelent. More movements, simplified Sands of Time mechanism, the combos, etc. But the major flaw of the game (at least the GC version) is that the sound editing is very poor. There are parts where the absence of sound make the whole scene to lack of excitment. Also, there are sections where the soundtrack stops suddenly, and giving a sense of emptiness in the gameplay. On cutscenes, the voice and the image don't mach, making it anoying, and the very last dialogue with the defeated final boss has no sound at all.The game is excelent thoug, and I'm waiting for part 3 to be released soon, but with another sound department for god's sake..."
3,Why does it crash?,I really want to like this game. I've played the first prince of persia on the gamecube. The graphics are better looking on this second GC instalment. The whole game has a grittier and darker feel to it. It has a long play life. It's taken about about 2 weeks of evening playing and apparently I've missed quite a few power ups so possibly some replay value.A minor gripe with the game is the music. What does heavy metal music have to do with ancient Persia? There is the occasional track where Persian tones blend well with a modern track but on the whole it's out of place.My major gripe is the crashing. My game has crashed 3 times and I haven't finished it yet. I thought that crashing games were confined to PCs and the older consoles.Generally a game I'd recommend if you save often enough.
5,!WOW! THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOOD GAME!!!!,"Well i have been wondering if there was going to be a NEW Prince of Persia after beating The Sands of Time. Soon I searched it up and found out that they where. I got the trailer and the graphics are GREAT! It looks as if it was almost real, but still game looking. It also looks like you can have more moves, more monsters, and even more bosses. Over all this is a great game but it looks like it will be mature(not stopping me),and will be more bloody(COOL!!!), and not for little kids or teens(But me)."
1,"Does not fit 8"" calphalon one nonstick fry pan","I bought this lid for my 8"" fry pan (after I called the company and was told it would work) and it does not fit. I called the company back and they stated ""Oh yeh, we have been having that problem with these"". They also stated that they do not have a lid that will fit the pan, but may make one in the future. Go figure??"
3,scary for little ones!,"This is generally a fine story, but it was read to my 3 year old at preschool. She is too young for it and the dark images have made an impression on her. Whenever something bad happens, she blames Abiyoyo. The book is fine for ages that better understand monsters aren't real ... same with ""magic"". Just wouldn't recommend it for kids under 5."
5,Rose for the Nose,"This is a great scent, one of my wife's favorites and mine too on her. I've tried other ""rose"" oriented scents for her in the past, but haven't liked any of them until this one. The others were too overbearing or powdery smelling which I can't stand, but this one smells great! Flowery & feminine, a definite day time winner!"
3,I was disappointed,"I had high expectations for this book, thought it would teach me the correct way to render my sketchings of people better... I really think the sketches in the book could have been better, I thought it looked a little amateurish. Although the author covers many things and tries his hardest to convey what needs to be done, I think the photo lacks more instructions and step-by-step advice.For instance: he will start with a semi outline of a body and just show you how to fill it in... it wasn't until later in the book he actually tries to show you porportions.And in the beginning, he has you starting off my scribbling. Maybe that worked for others, but not for me.I am starting a college drawing course in about 9 days and have been practicing my techniques from different books, but this is one book I'd rather leave on the shelf."
1,"It's a ""Death Bowl""","These are horrible. My neighbor gave me one of these with the turtle they had. It was a VERY young turtle and already it had outgrown it. Because of the ""lagoons"" size and shape, the baby turtles shell was being bent up and it is considered a ""Death Bowl"" by many for good reason. If you are serious about getting a turtle, be ready to pay $ for a good tank, food, vitimans, lights, basking spots, and some others. If you're not ready to pay for those and upkeep the equipment, then a turtle is definitely not for you."
1,I wouldn't if I were you,"I used to work in a pet shop, and let me tell you, I wouldn't take one of these things if they were free. First of all, the lagoon is not tall enough to hold enough water for a turtle to swim, and it's short enough that a turtle can easily climb out. Also, it's not big enough for a turtle unless it's a hatchling. Most states prohibit the sale of turtles that measure under 3"" across their shell because of the increased risk of salmonella poisoning, so chances are the turtle you get from the pet store will already be too big for this. Yes, it's adorable, but it's totally useless."
1,ex- budgie,"i thought this was to be a ltd. edition, and i see its still for sale after 8 years...... its not much at all like budgie, only for extremists, and i dont believe any royalties go towards band members..... a few bright spots, like the ray phillips drumming.... other wise its kind of scary, not recommended, buy 'squawk' instead. or"" power supply ""...."
1,Wrong ASIN number,"Amazon has the wrong ASIN number for this product. When you try to order it you keep getting ""FOR A FISTFUL OF YEN"" - complete opposite of what you want.and I didn't forget to give it any starsthis deserves no stars"
2,Not for a child to follow,"My daughter has been doing gymnastics since she was 3 years old (she is 6 now). When I bought this DVD, I hoped that I will be able to put it in and my daughter can have an additional workout at home when she does not have classes at the gym. It might be very good and valuable for a coach, but not something to practice at home. I expected a full work-out with a warm up and stretching routine, gradually transitioning to more complex flexibility exercises. The whole sections on the beam and bars we could not use, since that required going outside to use the apparatus (unless you have those in your living room).I'm stil looking for that great DVD that I can put in and my daughter can have an additional workout at home, while she is not in the gym."
5,Versatile and well made,"This Texas Griddle is a versatile cooking vessel for use over open flame. We use ours in our indoor and outdoor kitchens, on the stove, over the Weber grill, and on wood fire.The carbon steel is lighter than cast iron, and is non-stick coated, however I generally oil or grease it before use, as per cast iron use. I haven't had any problems (yet) with burning the non-stick coating.The pan is made in the USA, and has been durable under heavy use.The newer version of this griddle DOES NOT include grease spouts in the corners. It's not a big deal, but worth noting.Overall, this is a great pan/skillet/griddle for camp-type cooking."
5,Best Rome Restaurant Guide,"I bought 5 Rome travel guides (Time Out, DK, Insight, Rick Steves, and Knopf), and my best friend borrowed another. Unlike Rick Steves and Frommers, Time Out Rome had a fairly reliable restaurant section with corresponding maps. Thus, it was the only guide I took out of the hotel room during our 2+ week stay. Since I have no desire to pay for any more relatively expensive inedible food with heinous customer service, I will be buying Time Out guides from now on. By the by, almost all the other tourists were carrying DK guides (in several languages). I only saw a couple Midwesterners carrying Rick Steves (they were the ones reading the tour sections aloud) and another New Yorker carrying Time Out. It's a must have if you want to eat a decent meal."
4,Dogs and other philosophers...,"...should enjoy this book. This book is a lot lighter in tone than Hardy's later work, and is just a fun read. It's particularly enjoyable to see the twisted relationship of Gabriel, a good shepard graced with a dumb dog, and Bathsheba, the object of his attention and affection. Yes, plot contrivances abound, but the rest of Hardy's plot makes up for it nontheless. Enjoy!"
5,Far From The Maddening Crowd,"While written and set in a time long past, Thomas Hardy gives a real sense of what it must have been like to live before vast industrialization. This book draws the reader into the lives of the characters, telling a story of a pretty woman, who doesn't quiet know or really care about the effect she has on the men who's world she has pushed herself into.Hardy portrays Bathsheba as somewhat of a feminist, who at first only considers marriage as a means of raising her station in life. This becomes unnecessary when she finds herself inheriting a large estate. Although, not really interested in marriage Bathsheba begins to toy with the men around her. She meets and falls in love with a man who uses her to raise his station in life, this begins a complicated love triangle.Hardy detailed descriptions of his characters, their emotions, and their surroundings are exquisite.While the language may seem antiquated to some, I found it only added value to a story beautifully told."
2,"ugh, boring","Last read by myself 6 years ago in the 9th grade, I believe I overaimed my talents in attempting a research paper on such a complex and soul-searching literary piece. Clearly, Hardy intended this book to convey more than just frustration and utter boredom, though many readers of Far from the Madding Crowd reported overly exacting detail descriptions and drawn out passages to cause readers confusion and loss of interest. I hope you read it at the right time and to re-read it because the 1st time through does not capture enough detail or appreciation."
5,This is ENTERTAINMENT!,"One word: superb. But the best is yet to come... Seasons 2-5. Studio Executives, take notice."
2,Generally quite disappointing,"This show was a big letdown for me. The writing is poor, and the acting is worse. I found it extremely difficult to achieve even the most mild level of emotional engagement with the characters or interest in the storyline. There were a handful of episodes (mainly those connected with the larger story arcs) that rose above the rest, (which is why I gave it two stars) but even the best episode in this season did not hold the interest for me of even an average episode of TNG or DS9. Special effects, audio and video were also nothing to write home about. To be fair to the creators of B5, I should say that I only watched the first season and other reviewers have commented that subsequent seasons are better, but after this experience I have little interest in finding out for myself."
5,"The episodes are great, but...","...the disks [stinks]. I wound up having to go exchange it four times before I finally got a copy in which all of the disks were playable. One of them had four of the six disks with plainly visible, major scratches on them. Now that I finally have a set where each disk works, it is great. But I think someone needs to work on quality control at Warner Brothers... the fact that none of the disks will stay securely in their carriers may have something to do with the massive scratches, as they can slide around inside the case.Make no mistake though; the episodes are, for the most part, great! I just hope you have better luck out of the box than I did!"
5,Finally! Finally! Finally!,My wife and I have been waiting for the B5 series to come out on DVD and it has FINALLY ARRIVED!!! We like Trek a lot but nothing compared to the richness and full story-telling scope B5 so adeptly portrayed....
5,The life story of a truly unique leader,"Written by the late British historian Stanley Lane-Pools (1854-1931), Saladin: All-powerful Sultan And The Uniter Of Islam is an informed and informative biography of the great warrior, statesman, and faithful believer in Islam, Salah ad-Din ibn Ayyub, more commonly known as Saladin (A.D. 1138-1193). From his early years in a Kurdish military family to the beginning of his military service at age fourteen, to his conquest of Jerusalem marked by an unprecedentedly humane treatment of the citizens within, to his belief and application of civilized justice, Saladin: All-powerful Sultan And The Uniter Of Islam is the life story of a truly unique leader who deservedly earned his legendary status both in the West as well as throughout Islam."
4,What I expected,I needed a replacement for the 30 year old mop head on my mop and that is what arrived on time. Let's see if it lasts 30 years. :)
2,Didn't care for it.,I felt that she was trying too hard. In the end she came up with probably the worst case scenario and coming up with some crazy reason for how it would have happened. It could have been a good book but it was really weird. I didn't quite like how it was written.
4,Good Book,"I LOVED Double Identity and Running Out of Time by Haddix so I gave this book a shot. It's worth the reading.Britt and Bran have been living with only their mother, barely being supported. But then they move to Florida and Bran is offered to house-sit for an old couple he's been mowing for. When they move in to the home Bran starts acting weird...why?Okay so you might read that and think, I know why he's acting weird because I sort of thought the same thing. But trust me you would never expect what happens.The only reason it didn't get five stars was because Britt seemed childish at times and it got annoying but truely over-all is a worth-while read for 5th, 6th and 7th graders."
4,Whoa! Cost too much!!!,A quick search will show you a price for $363.00 on the internet. Amazon isn't THAT convenient to almost pay double....
2,This book was a disappointment to me,"I found this book to be a simplistic look at Asperger's. This book could be useful to parents who want to hear someone else's story. However, there is no discussion of interventions or services for the author's son. Her coping strategies for dealing with some of the difficulties associated with having a child with Asperger's I felt were too simplistic for me and so I had difficulty relating to the author. There are so many other very good books available on autism/pdd/asperger's. This one is not a must-read."

Who are they this isnt them....,Well I thought this Vandal Cd was gonna be alittle better than it is.This is one of the worst Cd's I have ever heard in my life.My Dog could have made a better Cd then this I am very sad that they made this Cd.Lets just all hope that they dont do another like this.All there other Cds were good.But this one BOMBED.
3,OK,Too much sugar. I would expect that granola not have so much in the way of sugar. I prefer Muesli.
3,Too much like the first game!!,"This game overall was very disappointing. The first game was very repetetive and boring. This one is almost just like SOT, except for being able to have two weapons and more boss battles, it was just a copy of the first one. Sure the battle system was tweeked a little bit, like being able to swing around a pole and slash at the enemies, and grappling people, but the puzzles and the fighting were not much diferent. The graphics didn't change AT ALL, and the character is still non responsive and slow. The only thing I really liked was the boss battles. Overall it was too much of a copy of the first game, that i couldn't even finish it without getting sick of it."
5,DLO PodFolio HipCase (30 GB iPod Video),"Long story short...This is the best iPod case you can get...i've tried several cases and skins and this is the only case that I feel completely protects it, is easy to use, and is very affordable. I would suggest any DLO product to all of my friends.If you're like me, and you want to protect your iPod and hate those scratches and smudgy marks...this is the solution. I absolubtly love this case...It's snazzy looking too!Also featured on this case is a belt clip on the back...It's very useful for carrying it around. It also features holes for the headphone jack and charger port. There is also a hidden compartment when you flip the case up, very useful for change.Anyways, Long story short...BUY THIS PRODUCT...I can personally speak for anyone who loves to keep their iPod clean and stylish, I personally recomend this."
5,Well made and classy,"This is the second iPod case I have purchased. I like this much better than the first one I bought because it is leather and well constructed. I also like the fact that there is not a plastic screen in front of the iPod screen itself. The leather window is thick enough that the front flap does not touch it, therefore there is no grinding of dust or dirt causing scratches on the screen itself. There was always something getting behind the plastic window on my other case causing me to constantly blow it out or clean it."
2,Good Movie Really Bad English Subtitles,"This movie is interesting in that it takes a historical figure popular in Korea and presents her from a different angle. It clearly takes many liberties with the actual historical events, but artists should be given some license as long as they don't distort the integrity of the person they're are bringing back to life for the purposes of entertainment. However, the subtitles in this edition of the movie are absolutely horrible, at least for English speaking audiences."
1,TOTAL DELUSION,"Yes, this is not a book for humans, but the author explain things in a way that makes it even more complicated. But the biggest disappointment is the cd: NOT EVEN 1 working example, a working opengl project ... NOTHING of all that! If you want to use their pieces of code, you have to create a new project and make a lot of arrangments. By the way the cd is only 45 mbytes, so ... that is it !"
1,Not Happy!!,"Supposed to be an anti fog scope, never fired the rifle with it on. Took the rifle from a warm car into the cold air turned the magnifier and heard a poof of air come out and instant fog!! What piece of garbage!!!!!!"
3,Too expensive!,"I would just like to point out that for the same price as this lid, you can get the 12-inch ""everyday pan"" which comes with an anodized aluminum lid that is higher arched than this one, and weighs slightly less. So not only do you get a better lid for the price, which fits your Calphalon saute pan, but you get a nice extra pan to boot!"
5,Prefect companion,Perfect companion to my Calphalon stainless steel pan. I've just doubled the use of my favorite skillet.
1,how desperate can you get?,"it's hard to believe this drivel has been published, but i guess anyone with a gimmick and a title can get a deal these days. it's a sophmoric, obvious snore fest. Why should we care?"
3,"if you've heard one, you know the story of most bands...","After hearing what a great read this book was, I was really excited about reading it. However, once into the book, I found myself dragging..I kept putting it down and finding other things to do. She had alot to work with but it somewhere just lost its excitement. It was interesting to see how the band was courted by the music industry and then what happened with the release of the demo.The story is great, but there is something about the book, maybe the way it was written, that makes it fall a little flat. Somewhere after her daring haircut and meeting Flowers, it just kinda lost the ""spark"". I was truly bummed out cause it seemed like it would be a fun read. For those new to rock and roll life styles, then read this book. If you've ever watched VH1's Behind the Music, then you basically can pass on this one."
3,"Oh yes, someone is in the kitchen","Eric does a wonderul job of developing his characters and developing the plot in this drama filled book. I found myself rooting for some characters and feeling sorry for others. If you love drama, as I do, then get this book."
2,cute designs but patterns missing info,"I, too, am an experienced knitter, but many of the patterns appear to have incorrect, missing or vague info. There is no size listed for the finished pieces (or guage) which makes it difficult to visualize. Also, the dolls could easily be done in the round, rather than seaming each piece. Two stars for many cute designs."
3,Darling dolls but many errors,"I picked up this book because the doll on the front cover looked just like my daughter and I thought it would be cute to make one for her. I am a fairly new knitter but thought the pattern appeared to be something I could tackle. I did find some errors in the instructions for the legs (very confusing for a new knitter). I also found it strange that there was not any type of gauge or swatch (I was taught to NEVER skip this step!), nor the finished size of the doll or any of the toys. Once I did finally get the doll made up, it did turn out to be very adorable in a retro sort of way (think the Island of Misfit Toys on Rudolph) and my daughter absolutely loves it.I am now trying to knit up the wrap sweater, and the instructions are disappointing. I was hoping to make a set of clothes for her doll, but if the rest of the instructions are as erroneous or incomplete as the ones for the sweater, I'm afraid I won't get them done."
3,Good starter book,"Although a good starter book for a new knitter, I found most of the patterns not very creative. I think I only made one or two out of thw whole book. Easy instructons and simple stitches."
4,Not sure why this is getting bad reviews...,"I was looking for a book with some doll clothes patterns for a Waldorf-style doll I was making for my daughter. I picked this up at the library. One irritating thing is it doesn't tell you the size of the doll in the book, so I wasn't sure if the patterns would work for the doll I was making. But I set forth and made the wrap sweater and it was very easy and fit my doll very nicely. Which was a 13"" Waldorf doll. I also knit up the skirt and the undies. The undie pattern needs a little adjusting to fit better but the rest work out just fine. My kids love looking at all the fun stuff to knit and telling me what to make. After keeping it too long at the library and then wishing I still had it, I think I'll go ahead and buy it."
2,its better than the radio,"i agree with one of the other reviewers in that she ought to pick a style and get good at it.to be honest,all her songs sound exactly the same,not because the music is bad,,but because her voice has one style and thats it.the only thing she has to offer,is her face/body on the cover of the album.if she didnt have them looks,or that body,OR she didnt appear on the cover to begin with,, do you realy think we would have ever heard of her??hahaget real.save your moneyroy"
2,its ok,"I have a 4 year old male lab and he ate this thing in about half hour (some people were saying it lasts days, thats bs) but anyway it expensive considering how fast it was gone.......I will not be buying anymore"
2,Not a direct sequel,"Although the first Spiders movie was quite good, this one lacks most of what made the first enjoyable.There is no solid plotline, no interesting lead characters, no conspiracies, aliens, Men in Black, etc. All it really has going for it is seeing Bull, from TV's Night Court, as the villain.A couple are rescued at sea by a large freighter. On board is a doctor who is conducting experiments on giant spiders. The couple figures out what is going on, realize they are intended as victims and accidently release all of the spiders.In the original movie, the spiders were fearsome and nasty. Here they are almost backdrops. With the surface of the ship literally crawling with the beasts, they mostly just stand around and do nothing, not even chase their prey.Stick with the first movie and avoid this thematic sequel."
5,the story of the world,"The Story of the World: History for the Classical Child, Volume 2: The Middle Ages: From the Fall of Rome to the Rise of the Renaissance, Revised Edition ... the World: History for the Classical Child)"
2,Very good but from the British point of view,"The quality of the paper, the margins, the font: all are quite good. Good pronunciation indications. Also reflects current usage (e.g., computer technology). Also very good coverage in terms of number of terms defined.The one problem I see is the fact that the dictionary is written from a British point of view, especially where colloquialisms are concerned. E.g., what does ""you can get knotted"" mean? Did you know that ""fug"" in English (British English, that is) means ""stale air"", and pog means ""stench""? The problem is much worse when only the British expression is given, without an indication that it is colloquial or British, where the standard meaning is different. E.g, verkloppen is defined with ""to flog"". Turns out in British English to flog means not to whip but to sell!PS: The book is still a bit better than Collins Concise German Dictionary, thanks to Klett's larger font and page size."
1,I am very disappointed with the game and NO Tech Support!!!,I purchased World Championship Poker as I was looking for a good Video Poker game for my PS2. The review I read said it has an excellent one on the disk. Well I have not been able to find the game on disc and there is NO mention of it in the manual. There web site offers NO technical support and only contact is the webmaster. There phone support is a toll call and all you get is a recording saying someone will call you back within 48 hours. I have called 3 times and got no reply. The last time I called I left a message that I would right this review of how poorly they treat their customers if I did not get a call back. Well here is my experience with them and I would highly recommend you not deal with a company that does not care anything about providing you good service and support. They are just plain terrible. A call back in 48 hours alone is absurd.
2,"Okay, but...","The screen protector was good at eliminating the glare, but made the screen resolution too degraded to make the exchange worth it. Any anti-glare screen protector will degrade the screen to a degree because of the mechanism by which the screen protector makes the screen matte. However, in this case, it made the screen almost difficult to look at. Definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
1,Takes quite a few mins to get a hang of how to use it,"It worked for my mustache hair but not my eyebrows very well.Yet again I have thick eyebrow hair and seen from other reviews its vice versa. its probably meant for people with delicate eyebrow hair, etc.Im a messy person period, but this stuff is REALLY messy. I had to microwave mine longer than expected for it to get the perfect mix to stir. And removing it is worse. It sticks to your fingers and skin ridiculously unless removed with a cloth and warm water.I've tried Sally Hansens stips and they work better."
3,"Not as good as vol 1, but still a good buy","I was a little disappointed in this video. Although still very good instructional-wise, the depth of instruction was not as comprehensive as Magical Motion. I agree with Rom's view that the instructional portion was just under 40 min while the rest of the DVD is taken up with performance examples and talking. However, the choreography at the end fits nicely with ""Beledi 1-1"" from ""Rhythm of the Dance"" by Solace...a good track to practice shimmies and other fast movements. My recommendation is to watch the video all the way through, then skip over the performances and go right to the instruction. On a side note: for those put off by the costumes and make-up, keep in mind that this was made sometime in the mid-to-late 80s. Look past the gaudiness and see the dancing,"
2,Buyer Beware,"Love these movies but beware when purchasing this set. Although the description says the movies are in both widescreen and full screen, only one of the DVDs in this set actually has the widescreen option. The others were full screen which does not work well with a high definition TV. I was so excited to get them but am now really disappointed in what I received."
5,complete love come softly collection,Great family movies teaches how you should never give up shows how family needs to stick together so you can get through what ever happens
5,Perfect sheet cake pan,"Just baked a Duncan Hines red velvet cake in my new pan yesterday. It came out perfectly, didn't stick or anything. These Nordic Ware aluminum baking pans to any dark, coated ""non-stick"" pan. Food cooks perfectly, doesn't stick, and the pans are easy to clean. This is the type of pan that is used in commercial kitchens, not coated cookware. Oh and the lid closes perfectly as well. 5 stars."
2,Road Map of Italy,"We got quite frustrated trying to use this map for driving around from small town to small town in Tuscany and Umbria. For our purposes, it was not nearly detailed enough."
1,"All hype, no depth!","Faith Hill's Breathe is all hype and no depth! There are three, if that, good songs to listen to on this cd. Her earlier work, especially Faith, was outstanding. I'm a Faith Hill fan who is deeply disappointed in this latest release. Well, hopefully there is another album release soon!"
2,Faithfully Breathless,"This work is far from the Faith Hill capabilty of excellent country music that we are used to. The venture into this styleof music leaves me feeling cheated out of a new Faith Hill CD that I will play over and over. This one gets played once. On the postive note, the title piece is terrific."
1,If I could Rate Her Lower I would,"What disgusting absurdity to call anything uttered from the mouth of this female COUNTRY. I suggest to you all if you have forgotten what Country music from females is supposed to sound like, go to any selection by: Norma Jean, Kitty Wells, Loretta Lynn, Patsy Cline, or Patty Loveless' ""Nothing But the Wheel"". This woman's voice hurts my ears and she is a wretched excuse for anything that even closely resembles Country Music. There has been ""Murder On Music Row"" and this is one of the culprits behind the death. Obnoxious moaning and whining from somone who needs to be with Prince or Puff Daddy. Don't even waste your money if you are looking for country music!"
2,Refund,"What happened to Faith Hill. I am so extremely disappointed with this cd. She There are only two good songs, Breathe and the duet with Tim McGraw. She is turning into a pop singer rather than country. Her music is turning into something that Shania Twain would sing. Maybe her next will be better."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,This album is typically Faith Hill and I wish I'd never wasted the money. I thought maybe she had improved. The songs are boring. They sure do NOT have you tapping your toes. I found maybe 2 I can stand to listen to. Anyone want a Faith Hill CD? I'll send it to you ...its the WORST.
2,Faith's voice saves this CD,"Need I say more. Enough of these country artists going pop! She may appreciate all kinds of music, but it doesn't mean she has to sell out. Her duets with Tim McGraw don't measure up with Tammy and George. Most of these songs will be forgotten in two years."
1,Rip-off,"Why do I have to give this a star? What's with this song ""Breathe""? Now people might associate this with the awesome song by The Prodigy. Do yourself a favor. If you're looking for Breathe, get The Fat of the Land by The Prodigy."
1,Losing Faith?,"The album, Breathe, seems like an out-of-body experience from Faith Hill. The title cut has a lot of character and is artistically challenging and interesting. All other songs on Breathe leave me feeling cheated and robbed of the heart and soul Faith has put into her other albums."
2,"NEED TO ""BREATHE"" SOME LIFE INTO THIS PUPPY","I love Faith Hill, her voice, beauty, and presence....But ""Breathe"" is really lacking. The songs all sound the same, as for the CD it sounds more Pop than Country.Its okay, but I wanted Country, not Olivia Newton-John.Sorry but this CD I only recommend for the diehard Faith Hill fans, or buy her last CD- thats a CD!"
2,Borderline Awful!,"This album has one extremely strong track which is ""Breathe"". Songs like ""The Way You Love Me"" are next to pathetic really and songs like ""Bringin' Out the Elvis"" (or whatever it's called) are so stupid they are extremely hilarious. Faith seems to be very full of herself, but she shouldn't be. She doesn't have a great voice, it sounds very trained. Just about the only thing she's really got going for her are her looks. The song ""Let's Make Love"" honestly makes me want to throw up. Give it a listen yourself and I'll let you decide. My belief is that if you like real musicians with real talent you will NOT like this cheesy album."
4,Fantastic Album,"I purchased Breathe way back in November, but now is as good a time as any to post a review. When I first got it, I wasn't really crazy about it. It has definitely grown on me. Breathe, the title song, is one of my favorite songs in recent memory. It just is awesome. Other favorites for me on the album are It Will Be Me, If I'm Not In Love, That's How Love Moves. The very best on the album is her cover of Bruce Springsteen's If I Should Fall Behind. It doesn't get much more beautiful than that, folks. The album is really worth your while."
4,Number 5,"I really like the song ""Let's Make Love."" It's a great song. Faith and Tim sound so good together. I really love the song. It's a song you would want to dedicate to that ""special someone!"""
4,"Great album, but lacks emotional depth!","When I purchased this album,I expected it to be repetetive to its predecessor. Gees was I ever more wrong? It is a solid piece of work. This sounds as if she purposely tried to appeal to a whole new crossover audience, can you really blame her after 'This Kiss'. Although traditional fans will dislike this immensely, other 90's country fans will love it. I believe Faith exceeds greatness on ballads, but there are very few on the album, and they are great! The up-beat songs are pop, and fun!Sickout tracks include:'Whats in it For Me', Breathe, Lets make love, Love the Way You Love Me, If I'm not In Love, If I should fall behind, and There Will come A Day. This album is busting at the seems with crossover potential! Way To Go FAITH!"
3,Breathe,At first I didn't like Faith Hill. But then I had bought it an I thought that this album wasn't to bad after all. Probably the best songs on this album is Breathe and The Way You Love Me. This album can be enjoyable to listen to and to be able to relax to it.
4,PLEASE! Cross over?,"I love Faith Hill and yes, this album is definately different--but to those who say they were ""blown away"" by the cover and thought her song with Tim was ""provacitive""? C'mon, she put on hair extentions and sang a beautiful song with her husband.A little of pop may be in there, but even if it is a ""cross over"" album, doesn't everyone want more people to be able to listen to Faith's music? I was always under the impression that we wanted as many people as possible to enjoy her work. Faith is beautiful, if she wants to look that way in her album, then I don't think that she should get critcized for it!"
2,Very disappointed with her new CD,I was very disappointed with Faith's new cd. The only song on this cd that I can really recommend is Breathe. I loved her other 3 cds. Maybe her next one will be better
2,Is this really Faith Hill?,"I was expecting so much more from this CD. Her last album ""Faith"" was excellent and this one lacks quality. Better luck next time."
2,"A big, but disappointed fan","I thought that this album wasn't the Faith that we have seen in the past. I think trying new things is great, but this album seemed like her heart wasn't in it. I really felt that she was jumping on the ""glitz, glamour, and appearance"" bandwagon that has been growing (sadly) in country music for the last couple years. I hope that she sticks with her roots and her heart in the next album. I really think she is an incredible musician and I hope that she doesn't get lost in the hype of being flashy."
1,cd for sale!,What a waste of money! I think Faith should go back and listen to her first 2 cd's and start over. I am very disappointed with this one.
4,Shows what mathematicians were doing fifty years ago,"These essays were probably intended to demonstrate to science undergraduates what university mathematics was about.It's interesting to look at mathematics texts over the generations. Sometimes the vogue is to make the subject, even abstract mathematical methods, concrete and comprehensible. Other writers make the subject rigorous, comprehensive and incomprehensible. I have issues with math books that claim they make an engineering subject easy, yah in the author's fantasy, by reducing the subject to rigorous mathematics. bah !"
1,great for new or experienced candlestick charters,Melvin Pasternak's 21 Candlesticks is a clear and straight forward discussion of the candlesticks that will affect the trader the most. These are the ones that every trader must know by name. Learn to increase your accuracy and make decisions with confidence.
2,Disappointing,This author could use some editing. In too many places the story line is interrupted to go into way too much detail about dog breeds and neighborhoods. I found myself skipping over those parts sniffing for the trail of the story again. I love dogs and dog mysteries but this one fell flat. A better choice for readers is the Raine Stockton series by Donna Ball.
5,The Best Thing out there if you suffer from this fear,I have done lots of research on anxiety and nothing offers such relief as Janet's book. Just reading it brings relief because she relates to pain since she has experienced it herself.I highly recommmend this book!!!
3,I can't understand all of the 5 star reviews here,"This book is not anything new. In fact much of it is descriptions of fearful situations and physical symptoms rather than any sort of help in overcoming speech fear. The two helpful pieces of information I found here were: the use of the medication Inderal for performance anxiety, and creating a Plan of Action in overcoming said fear. The rest is filler.For a great resource in overcoming public speaking and performance anxiety, read The New Talk Power by Natalie Rogers."
2,"Lame at best, waste of money at worst","Don't buy these, they just aren't that useful. If one were to take the time he/she spent looking at these crappy things and instead simply wrote the underlined words from the Examkrackers books onto note cards he or she would probably be better off. These pretty much suck. Buy the Nova physics and cartoon guides to phys and chem instead, that way you actually learn something. I hate myself for having bought these flashcards, and only hope that my children, should they be healthy and reach adulthood, will grow to both understand and forgive my transgressions."
3,Exactly as advertised,"The colors are just as bright and bold as shown. The quality of the material is good! The set is pretty durable. NOTE that this is a HOGWARTS set, not a GRYFFINDOR set."
3,Nice Scarf but It's No Hat,"The Product is described as a ""Knit Hat Scarf"" it's just a scarf, it's a nice scarf but it's no hat. There was no hat in the traditional sense in the package. I gave it as a gift so I never opened the packaging to do a thorough inspection. Shame on me."
1,very disappointed,"this book was an awesome read, enjoyed it very much. I wasnt real fond of the ending simply because I wanted more...that is why I happened to run across this book, Grace, but was rather disappointed because this was just another name for the book titled Allure. So to other readers the titles Allure and Grace are the same exact book but would highly recommend."
5,This Canadian TV Show Rocks!,"The story line can be far fetched at times, but the script gets brought back home time after time by the excellent cast. (You gotta love the Intern!) The skill and timing of this comedy leaves me wondering, why can't we do this type of television here in the states? I'm hoping to find more quality Canadian TV and film to ""import"" into my viewing library.Signed: A neighbor to the South,"
5,Bought as a gift - my friend loved it!,I bought this and another scrapbooking book as a gift for a friend. She loved both books and said they would make nice reference books for her hobby!
4,great book,THIS IS A VERY GREAT BOOK I MEAN YOU CAN EXPRESS YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT BOOK AND I AGREED WITH THEM I FIRST READ THIS BOOK IN THE LIBRARY AND I BORROWED IT AFTER I READ IT I THOUGHT OTHER PEOPLE WOULD LIKE IT TO THIS SHOULD BE ONE OF THE WHOLE NATIONWIDE KIND OF BOOK.
2,Less than expected.,"It appears to be a ""second"" product. Many flaws in the glass, and a deep scratch near the bottom of the globe where heat may pick this up as a weak point and cause it to break."
5,Lincoln Medal of Honor,"This was a very interesting book, written years ago and well worth the read. Very good ""Short?"" bio on General Vifquain and well written.....Nebraska youth should read it."
2,"No instructions, damaged merchandise","Looks like a nice unit, but they did not include any instructions in the box to put it together and Amazon has no instructions online and neither does classic sports. Also, the laminate wood is seperated from the pressboard and one piece is broken. I guess I will wing it trying to try to put it together, glad I started day before Christmas eve as opposed to Christmas Eve."
2,Classic Hoop,"This item is extremely heavy. It does not come with instructions for mounting or assembling. It cannot be mounted into drywall without difficulty. The mounting brackets are not in a position that allow you to mount into any ""typical"" wall studs. We contacted Amazon and they were very willing to pay the return shipping costs for the return of this item. It is 1/8/07 and we are waiting on our refund which I'm sure will take place very soon. I was just glad that I did not lose money on the return of the item but there is no way we could use this item in our fairly new house.Renee Scott, Virginia"
2,Save your money...buy a different book,I was very disappointed in this book. The part of the book about how to actually cook once and eat for a week was very small. The book was mostly recipes. I returned the book ASAP.
5,Stranger Savvy,"This excellent book is a good teaching tool for helping children recognize who is a ""kind"" stranger as opposed to someone they don't know who is unkind. The beautiful illustrations add to the books appeal; the hypothetical scenarios will undoubtedly help children and parents think of methods to apply when faced with ""unkind"" strangers."
5,3 must sees,"Wow your all in for a real treat once this 3 pack comes out! Spirited Away (possibly the best animated movie out there) along with other Miyazaki's movies will be a real treat instead of having to go back to buy another one. (Aside from the fact that they took out Laputa and changed the title to Caslte in the Sky, the movie hasn't changed one bit!)These movies are must sees!"
1,Dumas Fans Will find This Movie Absolutely Dissapointing,"How can a movie director abandon a wondefull Dumas script and explore his own horrible version of the story is beyond me. This movie could have been a masterpiece, like the wonderful adapatation of the Lord of the Rings. However, as a Dumas admirer I was deeply disappointed by what I perceived to be a catastrophic remake of a brilliant novel. I cannot understand why the movie director did not stick with the original book! The book is an adventure classic of all times, and yet the director acted as though Dumas' plot was not good enough for him. However, if you haven't read the book you will probably enjoy this superficial and deceiving movie."
1,They didn't read the novel before they wrote this BOMB!!!,"Probably the worst re-telling of a great novel I have ever seen. Only scant resemblence to the Dumas book appears in this movie. the screenplay is contrived and the action uneven at best. It's too bad because the actors do a nice job with their roles. This may be an unfair criticism because I couldn't bear to watch this thing to the end.The version with Gerard Depardieu is no more satisfying or faithful to the original source.For the new generation of moviegoers, try to see the made for TV movie with Richard Chamberlain as Dantes. You'll enjoy Alexandre Dumas much more than Alexandre Dumb..."
4,Excellent Family Entertainment,"I didn't go to this movie expecting much. After all, this story has been told over and over again. But I was pleasantly surprised by a rare film, at least in this day and age, that succeeded in not only being very entertaining, but by being so with nary a curse. I'm no prude, but this movies ability to entertain was undoubtedly enhanced by the fact that I could take my kids with me with no remorse. They (aged 10 and 15) enjoyed it as much as I did. Maybe the lashings and some of the sword fighting could be sort of intense for a young kid, but that same kid will probably go home and wreak relentless havoc on his PlayStation2 anyway. My point is that I believe that this film will be enjoyed by anyone drawn to the story, and it will offend no one. A rare feat indeed. Richard Harris was a standout by the way...."
2,a good movie but a horrible adaptation,"As a movie the Count of Monte Cristo is entertaining on its own but when compared to the book it is horrible. There are several instances where Hollywood had its way with the plot. The revelation about who Alberts real father is being the worst. This did not happen in the book. The movie lacks the style of the book. The Count was much more subtle and devious in the book and never stooped to getting is hands diry himself. I also don't recall any sword fights in the book (although they were decent, but nothing spectacular). As I said, taken on its own the movie is entertaining but it deviates terribly from the book which is superior in everyway."
4,Old fashioned swashbuckler,"This movie is much better than it's box office results would indicate. There is much to reccomend it even if it is not a literal interpretation of the Dumas novel. The movie is a classic revenge tale and Jim Caviezel is outstanding in the lead role. He is betrayed , imprisoned and while in a bleak island prison he encounters A philosphical priest and fellow prsioner played wonderfully by Richard Harris (very reminiscent of his Marcus Aurelius role in Gladiattor).After escaping from prison and returning to Marseiile disguised as the fictional Count Of Monte Cristo he takes his revenge on all of those who did him wrong earlier.The film has good acting, it is well adapted as ascreenplay and the locations and costuming are gorgeous. Overall this is a very enjoyable film that was overlooked in the theaters but certainly makes a fine evening's entertainment on DVD>"
1,Couldn't watch it,"I admit it, I couldn't get past the first five minutes. I read the book as a teenager, and along with The Three Musketeers, it has been my one of my favorites for many years. The opening of this alone is such a travesty that I turned it off. Edmand and some other drunk land on the island of Elbe to get help for their captain with brain fever, get shot at by British soldiers, and let off the hook by Napoleon, who tells the british they have nothing to do with him. What on earth does this have to do with anything? Thankfully, I only rented it from Netflix, and will promptly send it back."
1,Luis Guzman is in this one!,"My only reason for seeing this film is because Luis Guzman is in it. I find these Napoleon/Shakespeare/pirate films to very very dull, boring and over-long.Luis plays a much different role here than what we are use to seeing. Doesn't he look handsome in that red English coat?"
4,I'm a Count not a Saint!,"Great version of a Classic book & movie! If you like"",Get Back,"" movies this is a must see.The Counts character starts of as a vindictive person ,when released from his prison,but learns to forgive to save the thing he loves the most."
2,Hollyweird at it's worst,"I was gravely disappointed at this latest version of The Count of Monte Christo. Dumas must be rolling around in his grave seeing how his book was compromised for the big screen. If you want to see a movie faithful to the book, than this is not for you. However, if you want to see a movie with one red hot actor (Caviezel) and some decent swordplay, than this is for you. The costumes were beautiful and the acting was decent, the only elements saving this flick from the trash bin."
5,count fo monte cristo,"very good, I bought the original from amazon and this is one case where the remake is better than the first movie.I highly recommend it!"
3,decent but not even close,"I watched this movie with great anticipation after reading the book however, I quickly realized that this is not the same story that Dumas put on paper all those many years ago. If you have never read his book it will entertain you. It was entertaining but again it was not even close to the book. It would be better titled ""Kinda like the Count...Cristo""."
1,Disappointing,"Being a big fan of the book and also of the great French mini-series starring GÃ©rard Depardieu, I was very excited about this new movie. Well I must say that I was crestfallen, this movie should not have the title ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" it diverged from the original story that much that I had to hit the stop button before the memory of this wonderful tale was destroyed. Don't get me wrong, I am sure that this is a good movie in its own right, but it should be more than just loosely based on the original material."
5,The Count of Monte Christo,"The movie is excellent in all respects; however, the company, MovieMars, is not. First they sent an unusable CD due to it being the wrong Regional area. Then when I sent it back, at the expense of $5.43 mailing fees, they refused to reimburse me for the postage. They refunded the original fee for the CD, but not the postage for return fee. They claimed I should have known what Region I am in and which CD would or would not work on my machine. Well -- I have been renting, buying, and borrowing CDs for about 15 years and have never had this experience before. I believe the CD they sent was meant for foreign markets and they should have known which one to send due to my return address. Anyway -- they were nasty about it, and until I get the postage refunded to my Visa account, I will not be ordering from them, for sure, and probably not from Amazon. After all, Amazon is the company that is truly in charge here. Thank you."
5,great movie,Amazing drama about passion and revenge. Deffinitely recommended for your collection. The blu ray version does not have much difference from the dvd (as far as I could notice).
1,it is not what you expect after reading the book,"in general i would not recommend this movie, is not even close to the how beautiful the plot was created in the book. There is no feeling or revenge or pain which monte cristo went through in the book."
2,Dumas is rolling in his grave...,"The Count of Monte Cristo is probably one of my favorite books. Its numerous, but inter-connected plot lines are filled with suspense, romance, and ""you know you had it coming"" revenge. The movie adaptation of this novel was awful. Except for the title, character names, and a few other details, there is nothing in the movie that resembles the original. The movie only focuses on the struggle and revenge of Edmound Dantes, which turns out to be a watered down version of the book's. No amount of fight scenes would have saved this movie. Plus, the ending is completely different!!!!I would only recommend this movie if you plan to NEVER read the book. If you have read The Count of Monte Cristo, DO NOT SEE THE MOVIE! It will only disappoint you. Like it did me."
5,Top 10,"A beautiful movie. I will admit movies never meet a reader's expectations, but as a movie, this was done very well.It makes my top 10 list, if that means anything. Others include Braveheart, A Few Good Men, and Tombstone. Wildly different, yet all good. If you like these movies, then trust me, you've got to see this one.Plus, you've got to love sweet revenge."
5,A classic movie,"There is nothing bad to say about this movie. The story, the acting, everything is well done. I bought it to watch over and over."
2,"Good movie but,","This is a very good movie but, the only thing it has in common with the book is the movie has some of the characters. There, that's it. The movie could have been named anything but, not ""The Count of Monte Cristo."" If you really want the whole story, read the book. It's a great book. A good movie but, it has nothing to do with the book."
3,Um .. ok but?? READ THE BOOK FIRST.,"I would say that the movie was good, but after reading the book does no justice to the Real Character of Edmond Dantes.By all means watch the movie!The acting for one is BRILLIANT. IT is Good as I said .. but I could not help noticing that it missed the point of the many important Characters and historical points that Alexander Dumas in the book covered.I only comment as I felt the book better and the movie seemed to bend and cut and paste people and events described in the book to make almost a mokery of the clear moral ground Dumas stood on in the area of Revenge and Providence.Makes interesting food for thought. READ the Book first. Do the story Justice Hollywood and tell it how it is. :-)GS."
1,The Count of Monte Cristo,"James Caviezel version is awful. He oversimplifies the plot, the characters are shallow, and flow of the movie is choppy and confusing.While Jesse James may have used a gun to rob his victims, the producers of this movie used the title of a great book to steal my money.I expected much more and am sorely dissappointed."
1,Disappointing beyond words,"The first and only time I watched this movie was about four years ago and to this day I am disgusted by it. As many before me have already said, the movie should be ashamed for calling itself ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" when it so clearly did not follow the book.While the movie was absolutely ridiculous and cringe-worthy throughout it is the ending that is the most appalling. It is a soap opera ending. An illegitimate child? Really? And Fernand's ending was atrocious. The novel's conclusion for him was far more satisfying and fitting. The movie didn't even portray the moral that Dumas' novel was getting across that revenge is not worth it. No, instead everything pretty much works out for Dantes in the movie and everything is wonderful.If you loved the book stay as far away from this movie as possible, it will make your blood boil."
3,It's ok!,I like the cookie sheets but they are already chipping....the teflon is already coming off in spots and my food is sticking to them and the coting is on the food....
5,Great Tea for a good price,"Here in Texas it is hard to find any gunpowder tea so when I found this on line I was very happy and when I got it, I was happier! Great taste and a good price. Who could ask for more!"
5,Great Gunpowder,"I'm very happy with this green tea, especially for the price. It doesn't make me as jumpy as my black teas, and has a pretty good green flavour. I needed a green tea to serve to friends and we are all enjoying this one. There's nothing terrible special about it, but nor is it offensive in any way. There is a tang to it, but we don't find it to be bitter if steeped properly. At this price for this amount, I can recommend this Gunpowder Green."
4,Inexpensive gunpowder tea,"Upon opening the tissue paper-like bag inside of the thin cardboad box, my first thought was that there were a lot of little stem pieces and tiny twigs, probably in excess of 20 per teaspoon. I was not real impressed. After brewing a cup I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not good at describing flavors, but I did know that I really liked it and I drink alot of tea. I always add a good dollop of raw honey so that may have had some bearing on the flavor. I brewed the leaves twice and both cups were good. I then examined the used leaves. I found that they were bits and pieces, no whole leaves in sight. But considering what I paid for this tea I was still happy. I feel it is an excellent deal for the money, with a good, pleasing flavor, but due to the abundance of stem pieces and no whole leaves I felt I could not go higher than 4 stars. I would definately buy this again."
1,False Advertising,"Buyer beware -- this product does not arrive with the N29 tip as advertised, making it unusable with a Thinkpad T60.Kensington will send the tip in ""12 to 15 days"" via USPS. They claim there is ""no way"" to get the missing tip sooner.In summary -- if you buy this item know it may not arrive as advertised."
5,Kensington inverter WOW,Used this on an African safari where there was little (solar) or generator power in the camps. Had to keep my camera batteries charged and this worked like a charm. Simply plugged it into the Land Cruiser while we toured the Serengeti. I ended up giving it to he Tanzanian tour leader b/c he liked it so much.
1,No Tip for Lenovo (IBM),"Believe it or not, Kensington does not have a ""smart tip"" for one of the most popular laptops on the market - the newer Lenovo (IBM) Laptops. When tech support was contacted, I was told no tip was planned for the Lenovo in the near future. This is unacceptable. I also have an Averatec laptop which does accept a Kensington ""smart tip"", but the tip it too long and subjects the computer to possible damage.From other posts I have read, not having proper tips for various makes and models is an ongoing problem with Kensington. They need to get their act together.Update - I was sent an IBM tip that worked - at no charge. Now a 5 star product."
5,Works great!,"I've only used this in the car so far, and not on an airplane. I actually bought it for when on long family car trips or on the road for business. It even charges my computer battery when plugged into the car, so I'm very pleased. FYI, the loud fan some have complained about is not a big deal at all. The fan portion sits on the floor, and I can't even hear it over the car. I can't imagine how anyone can hear it on an airplane unless they're not putting the fan portion on the floor; the cord is long enough to put it on the floor, so problem solved."
1,Shipping problems from Amazon,"Amazon.Com Shipper says they ship to the US but will not ship to Hawaii, USA... Product never bought for this reason."
1,Note To Self,"I bought this movie but was never able to watch it. I could not connect with the player from amazon. I tried on my computer, iPad and iPhone. I would like my money back"
5,Simply Excellent,This movie was very good it touches on real life stories and for that I am greatful! If you are looking for a movie that not just good but great this is it. This is a very good movie for christian because there is no real profanity in this picture & that one of the things that make the movie great.
2,Definitely not a reference book,"I was highly disappointed in this book, but perhaps that was due to my high expectations. Documentation of wxPython is weak, and often I've been told ""get the wxPython in Action book"". However, this book is more of an introduction to GUI programming with wxPython rather than anything closely resembling a reference book.There are some useful bits in the book, but by and large it will be gathering dust on my bookshelf. The biggest disappointment is the index which is almost completely useless to me. If you are new to writing GUIs in general, this is a good book for getting started. If you're an experienced programmer there's not much to glean from this book."
5,The standard book for wxPython.,"If you're reading this comment you're probably thinking; ""which book should I buy?"". But that's not the hard part. The hard part is figuring out whether you want to develop your GUIs with other toolkits, like PyQt. Once you figure out that wxPython is the toolkit you want to develop with, then the decision is easy. This is a great book and is THE book for wxPython development."
5,Camus as Robert F. Kennedy's Muse,"After reading ""The Myth of Sisyphus"", I begin to understand my hero, Robert F. Kennedy better now.It was during the years after the tragic death of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, that Robert was finally free for the first time in his life to struggle to create his own identity and sense of purpose.In his journey of self examination that followed John's assassination, Robert explored the writings of ancient Greeks, beginning with ""The Greek Way"" by Edith Hamilton.But it was in the existentialist writings of Albert Camus that Bobby Kennedy finally found a way of thinking that helped him to make sense of life's absurdities.For anyone who is facing some difficult or very strange challenges in their life, I strongly recommend a serious look at Albert Camus' writings, beginning with ""The Myth of Sisyphus"".It's not optimism, to be sure, but it does help one to make some sense out of troubling times."
3,not too shabby,"While I love Camus for his novels, some of his philosophical essays are phenominal. Such is the essay ""The Myth of Sisyphus"". This book is worth the cash just for this one essay. There are a few others that might quench your thirst for a quick Camus fix, but I personally find most of the essays repetative and I am quick to loose interest."
2,Beyond The Millinnium,"For those who have read both the ""Third Millinnium"" and ""Fourth Millinnium"", you should find this to only be a re-visit of the first novel. We watch the same characters work through the exact same struggles as before, however, this time the perspective is more from the viewpoint of the angels; the Arch-Angel Michaelin particular. It would be unfair to compare the author's use of 'angels as characters' with Peretti's ""Piercing the Darkness"". Those who are looking to nd a similar novel will be disappointed. This is not to say the novel is poorly written, for it is not. There is a marked difference in the writer's use of angels. While Peretti's are more actively involved in his plot lines, Meier's have a stronger sense of character development; such as exploring an angel's first exposure to hatred, anger and war. Overall, an easy book to read, with occassional events that may cause the reader to stop & wonder."
4,The Hell Screen (A Sugawara Akitada Novel),"Quite a good read. Very gruesome, yet provides a different reading experience. I may buy more books written by this author. And it's pretty lame that I must write at least 20 words (repeated words don't count) - why is this so? I am not too good a writer, you know?"
2,not durable,"I bought this for my boyfriend, who always loses his wallet. He has used it for less than a week and the fabric loop that connects it to the chain broke today. It is clearly poorly made and doesn't serve its purpose. I wouldn't recommend it especially considering the price."
3,I read this with my team weekly.,"I generally do not like story telling books. This is light hardy and has some good information. I put it in a similar genre as ""Who Stole my Cheese"" and ""One Minute Manager"""
2,"Love the book, not the shipper!",I ordered 12 books in this series one day - this was the last one to come & in the poorest condition.
3,Sickening!,"I had seen so many good reviews about this Le Male, so I decided to try it out myself.I actually went to a perfume store and tested it. I loved it!I wore it for a couple of weeks, and the girls loved it too.After the couple of weeks, the smell became very nauseating to me (which rarely happens to me when I smell colognes).The vanilla scent is amazing, but there's something else that lingers with it that I find to be very repelling.It makes the fragrance smell like an old man... A REALLY OLD man! You know? The ""old people"" smell.Even my sister said it stinks to her.Anyway... Women really do love this cologne when it's on a guy.Maybe it's just my skin that brings out the ""old people"" smell in Le Male.I'll keep my bottle as a collector's item, but I'll NEVER waste another penny on this stuff again."
5,Wayside School is Falling Down,"Wayside School is Falling Down is a very good book if you like funny books. But you don't want to know about Mrs. Gorf or Mr. Gorf because they are very mean. There is not a nineteenth story . Mrs. Jewls is the nicest teacher, at least that is what they think. They said inside of a good teacher there is also a bad teacher. Never go into the basement because they think there are ghosts and people are in there.This is why I think you should read it."
5,A wonderful book!,"This book had a bunch of fun and crazy adventures at Wayside School. This book tells you stories about the students and teachers at Wayside School. The school was built sideways. There is no 19th story, but something weird happens. Allison visits the 19th story! Todd gets in trouble everyday, but soon he gets a cute stuffed dog that saves him from getting in trouble. Leslie's pigtail's saved Paul from crashing to the ground from the 30th story if the school. Then a new kid comes whose name is Benjamin Nushmutt, but everyone thinks his name is Mark Miller. A bunch of crazy things happen at Wayside School, and you don't want to miss out, do you? I don't think so. Hurray up and get this wonderful book by Louis Sachar, Wayside School is falling down, and don't forget to get Wayside School gets a little Stranger and Sideways Stories from Wayside School, all by: Louis Sachar."
5,Its a funny book,This book will make you laugh you butt off.It'll be the funniest book you have ever read.(HA!HA!HA!)
2,Don't buy!,This toy is durable but it doesn't shoot very far so it wasn't fun for our nephew at all. I should have spent more money for better quality.
2,do not buy,i bought it today put it around my wrist and the plastic handle broke u cannot pull the elastic back half the distance of others but a good first slingshot
1,BAD BAD,If you want to lose your eye or if you like cheap products then buy this. Broke after one or two pulls. Rubber is poor quality.
1,Came burned and melted,The rubber part of the slingshot came out of the box brown and melted. It was obviously burned at the factory and was shipped anyway. We could not even use it once. Very disappointing.
3,Good but not durable,I got this sling shot thinking it would be fun. It was fun. WAS. One day I pulled it back 1 and a half feet and the rubber sling ripped.I perfer to get a different one.
1,Horrible,purchased 2 of these one came with a dry rotted sling band... was really disappointing... also this is more or less for kids the part that rests on the hand is pretty small .....
4,'Dem bones,"Great value. Lots of shapes and sizes. BUT....I just looked on the sack and it said ""manufactured in China"". Uh-oh, I hope the Chi-coms haven't done in my ruff ruffs. Here's crossing my fingers.."
2,Region code not free,"I use to by opera BD and DVDs from many countries, all region code free. I do not understand why this BD is restrict to region A. Opera lovers are usually international minded people and so the consumers."
4,The waiting was worthwhile,"There aren't many versions of this beautiful opera on DVD and, as far as I know, this is the only one on BluRay. Waiting for it was worthwhile although this production is not exceptional. The big surprise is Emma Matthews, she acts and she signs beautifully. The famous duet of Lakme and Malika is a treat, as well as the Bell Song. The rest of the cast is OK but not thrilling. This is filmed in front of a live audience, so some of the scenes look not so great in terms of illumination. The settings correspond to the composer and librettist ideas and are a delight to watch. Overall, a very nice experience worth buying the BlueRay version. I just hope other Opera houses will stage and record Lakme in the near future."
1,Damaged product,I am giving this 1 star because it came with a big rusted gash in the side of one magnet. Very obvious defect! Poor quality control!I would have given it 5 stars otherwise. I love magnets and these would have been very cool to play with. But they came broken....
1,Broke within 30 seconds,Dropped one magnet on the floor within 30 seconds of opening the package. The magnet broke in half. The whole magnet is fun and very strong magnetic pull. Quality is poor.
1,Not as expected,"My niece likes magnets. Based on the reviews, I thought it would have something fun to add to her collection of donut, rock, and other magnets. They were nothing special about these. If I could return them, I would. There were no instructions on how to make them buzz. I would not recommend or purchase these again."
5,Good toy,Magnets work as advertised and can be used to make a vibrating noise when tossed together into the air. They've held up to several drops onto a wooden floor thus far and I think they were well worth the few dollars.
3,tough call,"The producers, not being staunch fans or season ticket holders, would understandably have a hard time picking the ""10 greatest games"". They went for the playoff runs, a logical choice. As a longtime fan however, I've got games on old VHS tapes that are much more gripping and nail biting. It has been fun though to watch and remember players from different eras. And what fan wouldn't enjoy watching the D knocking Brady around in SB-42!"
5,great book on what is wrong with the American Education system.,This book by Ed Hirsch clearly shows what is wrong with the current American educational system and defines what needs to change. This book should be read by school board members and educational administrators throughout the country.
2,Hirsch is right!,"I believe Hirsch has it right. The notion that core knowledge must be taught and processed in order for our youngsters to read, write, listen and speak fluently, becoming successful communicators is right on target. Apparently, educators (and the education curriculum) departed from this philosophy many years ago. Comprehension of subject matter is critical to learning.Dr. Snyder"
4,For the watercolorist dedicated to serious study.,"These are lessons and notes which serious students will appreciate having in an organized presentation. Workshop students often are caught up in ptg.and/or keeping up with the class and neglect to take legible notes. The deciphering at a later date,if it happens at all, often times is equal to reading a foreign language. Also, these lessons are passed on to the reader from the author/art instructor's knowledge received from other very well known artists. Many, of which are no longer with us and have become legends."
4,Great Library Resource,Mr. Wiggle's book is a great way to introduce and review correct care of library books. The illustrations are bright and colorful and the language is easily understood by small children. The kids in my library loved it!
5,Ready to grill the salespersons after this great book!,"I loved this book. I am a first time mom and adopting a baby. Most of the books I have read so far have been half filled with breast feeding and stretch mark advice. I don't need this, I am getting a baby, not having one. Not only did I take 12 pages of notes but I am ready to go to the Baby superstore and grill (or impress) the saleperson about the baby gear. Also, Vicki's humor made me laugh out loud sometimes. I really did think that the crib and nursery were your most important purchases until I started in her book. It might seem like common sense and who needs to read a book on what to buy but a lot of new mothers do."
1,Terrible Product!,"I bought this at linen's and Things during their going out of business sale, to bad they won't take returns now! I only gave [...] for it and I regret even spending that much. I contacted the company who made it and they are sending me a new one. The plastic screws is were this product goes wrong, so very wrong. Ill hold out to find a good ol' wooden one like my mom use to have, that thing lasted for years! This one, couldn't even make it through the assembly process! Ill try the new one out they send me, but I have very low hopes for it."
4,Amazed it's still available,"I would have given this 5-stars had Adobe been a good company for customer support, but they aren't. Pagemaker 7 is easy to use,full of goodies and if used to create what it was designed for it is the best. Neither Indesign nor Quark match Pagemaker for ease of use in designing books, brochures, magazines, etc. Pagemaker 7 was a huge improvement over 6.5 in that images are now sharp and not out of focus as they were with the first in the series.I don't think Pagemaker is worth the $600 listed by Amazon and other online sellers. I'm amazed it's still available but should think if you are doing books and want a software that makes excellent and accurate indexes and table of contents and also is easy to edit with its story editor, then this one is for you."
3,Opteka telephoto lens,"The lens is made of nice materials and seems to be strong. The lens works best as a viewing scope and for casual photography. It is a little ""soft"" at the longer focal lengths. Using it with a Olympus E-500, which has a natural magnification of 2x, the lens is a little too much. Again, a casual lens, but a little soft."
4,"Excellent book, but makes some assumptions","I just took the support test today and scored a 908, so I can't complain too much about the book. I will say that some of it apparently assumes that you are very familiar with some things, like Appletalk. I had to borrow a friends book (Sybex) to brush up on the things (Appletalk) that I wasn't very familiar with. My friend used the Sybex book only and didn't score very well, so I would definitely recommend this book if you want to pass the CCNP Support test (640-506)."
1,HARD TO USE AND YOU MAY EVEN HURT YOURSELF,"Big problems with punching out the rings. Took me about 15 minutes and a pare of seazures to punch it out. And I cut myself in the sharp plastic edge. The perforation is not done all the way throught the plastic, so you really have to use something more then just a finger to punch it out. Maybe it worth it at the end but so fur I'm just mad and hurt. Really hard to clean, litter sticks to the plastic and it's just a mess. It's better to pay more for the better quality."
2,cat won't touch it,"I hope I am one day able to say I love this product, but for now my cat will not go near it. I continue to pick her up and place her in it, but she just jumps right down. I guess I can praise it for making her hold her bladder until I let her outside."
5,My two cats are potty trained...WooHoo!!!!,I have two cats so I stayed on each step for 2 weeks as recommended and everything is great! There were a few mishaps but who cares? It's worth it not to have to deal with the odor and litter they track throughout the house. Not to mention I don't have to purchase litter anymore. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!
2,My kitty won't go near it. Sorry,"Well, I bought and the treats and the flushable litter..and put the cat nip inside the litter..followed the directions.. my cat hates it and won't go near it. She ended up pooping all over my laundry in stead..It is a no go for us. Thanks anyways.."
2,Was not impressed,"I bought this having high expectations, but got mixed results from it. Yes, my cat was peeing in the toilet after a few weeks, but could not quite get the hang of pooing on the toilet, and she would hold it in, and cry. Finally I quit trying to get her to use this. Maybe she was just more sensitive than other cats. All in all, it was made well, though, and the package came very quickly. The instructions were very clear, and easy to understand. Only problem is it doesnt come with cat litter- and you need flushable cat litter for this, that can be expensive looking for that."
3,Needs work,"The concept is good, however, it doesn't take into account kitty's incredibly strong instinct to bury. I'm down to 2 holes, but even if she goes in the water she'll still have to scrape half the litter in with it, and currently training is stalled because my toilet got clogged before she learned it."
1,Cats Didn't Get It,"I followed the instructions precisely. It all worked great and we were excited. The cats were going on top of the toilet into the liter, up until the point where we punched out the first hole. After that, it seemed like they were too afraid of it or something. Rather than attempting to use it, they would just hold everything in until they finally did their business else where. It wasn't like the cats were angry; more like they just didn't know what to do. I felt pretty bad for them, but I can't have all my stuff ruined by cat pee/poop. CitiKitty didn't work."
3,DON'T USE in CA,"Well, for those of you who are in California - bad news. Cat feces flushed down the toilet can cause deaths of some ocean wild life. Google ""cat litter sea otters"" and you will see. It is a law in California that all the cat feces should be disposed into trash in plastic bags. I wish I knew that before I bought the training kit."
2,Didn't work.,Did everything the instructions told me to do when the instructions told me to do it and it didn't work with my cat.
3,Some kitties will take to this better,"Hi,Bought this for a momma and her kitten. The momma (1 year old) took to this and was adjusting well to the hole. The kitten on the other hand is having difficulty but she is following her momma but did not like the sound of poop hitting the water. It could be that she is too young (3 months). For now, we are back to traditional litter box until she is older and will try again."
3,Good product but finding flushable litter has been a challenge,Locating flushable litter was a challenge and it is a MUST once you start cutting out the interior sections. My cat will pee on it but does not like it for pooping.
2,Messy and Disappointing Kit,"I have 2 indoor cats. They are both around 7 years old. I read the instructions and installed everything just like the manual said. I read advise from other users of this product and tried my best to teach my cats to use the CitiKitty. The litter was all over my bathroom floor. What a mess! Sadly, its not for my cats. Perhaps, it might work on the younger kitties.I wouldn't say that its a waste of money since this product is not expensive so I would say ""try it and see how it works for your cat"". Never give up! But unfortunately for me, its back to the automatic ScoopFree Cat Litter box."
2,My kitties weren't too thrilled,"I put the litterbox next to the toilet for a few weeks to get them used to doing their business in that general area. Then, I took the litterbox away and added the citikitty tray under the toilet seat, with litter in it. I introduced them to the small round litterbox on the toilet. I left it there for a few days, but they never used it. I think it was too small for them. They prefered to poop in the kid's closets. So, didn't work for me. :("
3,Works with some cats,"I bought this 3 months ago. I have 2 cats, a boy and a girl, both who are 3. The boy cat took to it right away. The girl cat was slower. So we moved at a slower pace. After 2 weeks of no holes, I finnally did the first hole. There was no issues, both cats went fine. 2 weeks later I procedded to the second hole. The boy cat at this point would use it even when I took the tray complatly out. Just jumps on the toilet and does his business. The girl cat however refused to use it and peed and pooped elsewhere. I finnally went back to the full tray with no holes hoping to start over. She will poop in it, but prefers to pee on carpet. For the last 2 months I have kept the full tray in there. She just does not like it. I am going back to a litter box this weekend. Maybe trying to train 2 cats is too much."
1,Not works for my kitty..... he peeps on my sofa after 1 week trained,"During the first week training, my cat held his poo for 3 days then finally poo on the training tray, one week later, I process to second step, took off the first ring, when my cat see water under it, he scared then peeps on my sofa instead and never wants to go back to the toilet anymore, failed............."
1,Unbelievable trouble,"This item brought us a busy weekend on cleaning cat poops in our house. Our cats are very good with litter box and they seem smart. So we'd like to experiment on this product but unfortunately it didn't work out very well. That was unbelievable messy, and if you think about it, if one day they finally learned, who is going to teach them to flush the toilet?"
1,Just plain wrong,I honestly think this product is cruel to your cat. Cats aren't meant to use toilets that is why they don't do it on their own. Cats want to dig in sand or dirt they crave it. If you can't handle that aspect of owning a cat I don't think you should have one.
3,Does the trick but not great for slow learners,"I tried training both my cats using the City Kitty. The product proved effective at getting them to feel comfortable on the toilet (see my Gizmo using the Citi Kitty in this video [...] However, as often happened my cats made two steps forward, one step back. When I needed to backtrack several steps at a time, it was difficult to do so as the cut out rings are permanently removed. Nevertheless, it did the trick. Another con: the tray is messy and really hard to clean. the white mat surface stains, too. overall an ok product, but the design can be improved."
4,CitiKitty Cat Toilet Training Kit,"So far so good!I'm 2 weeks into training and Dante (my cat)is doing well, learning quickly...I am giving him a little extra time to be sure he really ""Gets It"" but this is likely overdoing it a bit. Dante is 3 years old and a very smart cat... I can't say that the process is not messy..(it's a bit like potty training a child). Occasional messes, ups and downs and scooping every time the cat goes at first...I do recommend Worlds Best Cat litter in addition to the CitiKitty Toilet Training Kit...Really helpful stuff flush-able litter, Friends have warned me against other ""flushable"" liters but I haven't tried any of the others because this one works!"
1,Waste of Money,Didn't work for a 3 month old cat!! As soon as I cut the first hole (after 2 weeks hole free) she continued to use the floor as her bathroom!
1,Save your money,"I can't give this product a 0 as an option so it gets a 1.I saw this on Shark Tank and thought it looked like an interesting idea; the product is crap. It is very poorly made and it is actually dangerous to use. You need to cut out rings as the cat progresses and the areas are not perforated so you need to use a utility knife. The type of plastic used results in a very sharp edge, I ended up with a fairly serious cut on my hand because of this and you can imagine the risk of infection when you introduce animal waste bacteria into an open cut.Stay away from this product, the concept is good but the execution and design of the product is dangerous."
1,Just let the cat out.,I struggled with this and it was just a waste of plastic and made a mess and my cats never got it down; I just ended up letting them out when they need to go and leave them outside when I'm gone. It's work too but I don't have litter anymore. I should've saved my money and the earth on this product.
3,Not good for all cats,"I tried the CitiKitty Cat Toilet Training Kit on my 2 cats. The young male cat (10 months old approx. 10 lbs) did great. He caught on to the concept immediately. However, my 4 yr. old female cat (16 lbs) just did not understand. She used it for maybe the first week, and then decided she no longer liked her new litter box. We have now gone back to a standard litter box with a litter locker. I was really hoping that this would work, but obviously it's not for every cat..."
1,dint work for me,I gave it 2 months and it still don't work for my cats. I took my time like it says to do but my cats still go on the bathroom floor sometimes. It was a waste of money for me but it may work for you. If you have picky cats like I do don't waste your money.
2,"if you dont have time or patience, forget it!","I bought this as a gift for my daughter who followed the instructions diligently. With a lot going on in her life, the training period for this product became a frustrating burden. Great idea if you can put up with cat poop and pee all over your floor, missing the toilet...and you have the time to deal with it all - go for it. But it ain't easy."
2,"Great Idea, Flimsy Material, and Still Not Litter-Free","I was so excited about this product, but my 6-year old, 12-15 pound cats weren't. Getting them to jump up from the litter box to the toilet seat to see and use their new ""litter box"" was a disaster. Litter was everywhere on the floor and the cats seemed uncomfortable about doing their business. Sparing the dirty details, I wouldn't recommend this for a one-bathroom household or for cats that are not that adaptable."
5,A great reference,Too few Americans understand what their constitutional rights are and have no fear of these precious liberties being eroded. This little book goes a long way in teaching the basics of this founding document. It should be given to every student in the USA.
5,Awesome reference guide :),The perfect stocking stuffer or just a nice gift to give anyone at anytime :) I give them to young kids as well as 'old' kids :)
5,Accordion music,This is the best 'basic' accordion music book. It was published a long time ago and I was very happy to find it on Amazon.
4,All 5 49er Superbowls,"As most people stated, more games should have been included in this pack. It's essentially the original broadcasting for all 5 49er Superbowls. While it is the original broadcasting, I did notice there were some plays (very few however) that were cut out. This didn't ruin the experience in any way, but something I wanted to point out. Not too sure why that is the case. Also the quality on the Niners Superbowl against the Dolphins isn't that great, it's a lil foggy at times and you have to turn the sound up. Again, not a deal breaker as you can still visibly see all the players and the game itself. Overall, if you are a 49er fan this is still a must by. The great Montana and Young doing what they do best in the biggest of games."
5,Awesome!!,"This book was really interesting. The author makes u think Biff is gonna go for Tommie (the girls he's had a crush on for 23 months) but he actuly goes for the other girl, its a really interesting book and i really enjoyed it!"
4,Expensive Ink,"Expensive ink, but I had back luck with non-HP ink so I am somewhat stuck for now. Good ink but $$$"
5,Brand Name Cheaper quality Ink,There is not much to say besides that it is the brand name ink for the my printer and produces the same quality just as if i bought my printer. I have the Hp c7280 and have subscribed for delivery for this ink every 6 months through amazon . In addition i have free shipping and it comes right when i need it .On top of that i get it at a relativly good price and it gets delivered to my door with three days even with snail mail (free shipping) . I have also subscribed to the color combo pack
2,Works fine but doesn't last,The HP 02 ink cartridge does have quality ink but just how much is the question? I could see no where the amount of ink the cartridge contains. It seems as though I'm forever changing these cartridge which makes me question the quantity of ink the cartridge actually contains...
1,don't buy this,Don't bother purchasing this product. It does not work at all. Unless you have baby fine hair... I can't imagine it working for anyone on any body part.
5,Excellent game,"This was my favorite game growing up, and still is one of the best!! You start the game with 10 minutes to get to a headstone and become one of 6 characters-a witch, zombie, mummy, werewolf, vampire, or poltergeist. If you dont get to one in time you are a soul ranger instead, which is a skeleton. You have 50 more minutes to move around the board and get 1 key of each color, which each give you a different magical power depending on which character you are. I like this version much better than the newer DVD version."
2,Not 18 lohan,"The package for this video and the label on the tape suggest that it covers the 18 Lohan exercises. However, when I played the tape, it turned out to be the much shorter - and simpler - 8 Pieces of Brocade."
1,Garbage,"This is just another so-called ""historian"" engaging in the useless, masturbatory exercise of condemning the great figures of the past on the basis of what would be considered acceptable (i.e. PC) behavior today. When James McPherson - a real Civil War historian (and hardly a conservative) - says that this author got more wrong than he got right, it really tells you what this book is worth. It's not worth the paper it's printed on."
2,Great Knife but Sheath's Pouch is Missing,"I love the knife, sharp, very stable and nice handling. However, the sheath has a missing pouch.The sheath I have is also different from what's pictured. I can't find any link from the product page or order page to complain about this, don't want to return it either."
3,"interesting as history, entertaining to a degree","The real calue of GJG is, of course, the music. It's always interesting to see the Flamingos, Cadillacs, Eddie Cochran, jackie wilson, Harvey Fuqua and even Jimmy Clanton performing in their prime. Also the fact that this was Valens' only film appearance can't be overlooked. As a movie, it's watchable, but maybe only once. Freed, Clanton, Stewart and Berry were definitely not actors, and it shows to the nth degree here. In fact. there's not much acting in the film at all. And while it's cool to see the entertainers, virtually none of them -- maybe Clanton -- are doing the numbers that were the mega-hits for them. The only exception is Berry, and for some reason, his performances, all 2 of them, seem kind of lackluster, in particular Memphis. Still, it's a true time capsule on film. One interesting trivia note: Joe Flynn from McHale's Navy makes a quick appearance. And, naturally, not available on DVD at this writing."
4,The Compnay history of Enron,"Fox provides a critical link in the Enron story by focusing on a company history. This book is not really the story of Lay, Skilling and Fastow and the fall of Arthur Anderson. This is a book on how Enron the company rose to prominence and fell just as quickly. From the commoditization of energy trading to the asset light strategy that the company adopted the reader is taken on a step by step process of how the company fell. It is a careful business analysis and not a narrative so if you do not have experience reading and understanding business terminology this is probably not the book for you. This book does not delve into the stories behind the company so if you want the book that will vilify those who ran the company you will have to look elsewhere. For those who simply want a company history of Enron then this is for you."
3,the batman,good product from amazon.com. the batman first four seasons on dvd is a new take on batman in the animated world mostly directed to children or young teens. this new animated series had the daunting task of following the emmy award winning batman the animated series. so all things considered i thought this group of people responsible for all aspects of the creation of this series did a good job of retooling the batman franchise and taking a new and fresh interpretation of the batman. i would recomend this product for children and diehard dark knight fans.
5,"Get it and learn how to manage ""a coach's life""","Coaching is like creating its own jigsaw : a lot of books will only show you how to shape a certain kind of pieces. This book will help you to define the entire picture and then refine it in many different pieces. It will provide you with datas that should be applied and confronted in real life, not only read and understood. Other coaching books usually give skills and drills. This fields are fast-covered here. Even if Andy Lopez has chosen to emphasize the development of a good pitching staff, his chapter gives insufficient direction, poor skills advices, no tools to evaluate pitchers progression... I don't recommend this book to players who are searching for new drills and new techniques. I recommend it to young coaches who doesn't know where they should be headed, and where they should bring their players."
3,"Number 3 is okay, but....","I had to edit my initial review of this cd. I've played this one a couple of times, and although I personally don't feel it is up to par with volumes one and two, I upped the rating from 3 stars to 4. For me, it started out okay with #1 To Motherland but then the cd didn't hit its stride until I got to #6 Distant Plateau and #7 Awakening. It is because of this mix that I rated it 4 stars. The mixing of these two songs is a natural thing, and they will send you into another zone altogether. I can also say that I like following two songs, #8 Un Dia Mas and #9 Her Song, and for now that's where it ends for me. I probably would have added Onda's Waiting For Your Love, but I prefer Naked Music mixes of this song. The cd is okay, but I can't say it's great."
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"Real For Me is a #1 selection in my library! The characters ""have you"" the moment you get a copy in your hands. Real For Me will engulf you cover to cover! This is such a well written piece that I can hardly wait for the next work by MR. Eric E. Peete!"
4,Real For Me is a REAL treat!!!,"Glover should be on cloud nine. She's beautiful, intelligent, has great friends, and is engaged to a sexy, successful brother that tends to her needs but she feels empty, and wonders if her relationship is just following logical steps...and not the steps that her heart feels need to be made. When she meets Maxwell, a brother new to California, who is looking for something better in his life, Glover finds herself confused all the more as she is forced to look into herself to see what she truly wants, what will make her happy.Real for Me is a great debut novel by Eric Pete. I read the book in one sitting, and found myself totally engaged with the characters and wrapped up in the plotline. The dialogue was real and sharp, and Pete did a great job in fleshing out the main characters and giving them individual voices and quirks. I really enjoyed this novel and especially the characters (Glover's best friends are a treat), and would definitely recommend this novel....."
5,The inspirational empowerment of Truth,"What an incredible book!I was recently given this book as a gift.Each time I go through it I am just blown away by how each paintingis more incredible then the last.At first I thought I must be so moved by this body of work because I am a women.I was pleasantly surprised when my husband told me he felt just as moved.We each have our favorites.My favorite is ""Puerto Rican Stereotype: The Way You See Me Without Looking At Me""What a gift! Everytime I open it, I am filled with gratitude.Soraida Martinez has given all of us the gift of Verdadism"
1,I agree with Garcia,"I wholeheartedly agree with Mr.Garcia. Have people stopped using their eyes and minds? One does not need a formal education to see that this artwork is not good at all. The fact that the artist of this book has two degrees and other accolades makes this work even more embarrassing. While I agree that her work has helped to promote social justice and other positive cultural advancements, the truth still stands that the work is not good at all."
1,Contrived and Lacking,"As a puerto rican artist myself I find Verdadism (as she tries to quip uneffectively) to be bad art made worse by cliched commentaries. Her art is contrived, appears disingeniuos and most of all it lacks the asthetic qualities necessary to effectively communicate the elaborate messages she imposes on them. You give puerto rican artist a bad name."
4,Excellent!,"This is really a super book! It is a simple yet great idea to be able to put your child's photo in the back and have her appear in all of the pictures. I really appreciated the fact that a child gets to be shown actually doing something--producing some action. The text was also well done. Luckily, it didn't come across as being too corny. A great book for baby and parents!"
1,Hummingbird Feeder,"We were very happy with this feeder for the first two or three weeks. It is large and has places for the hummers to sit while they eat. But, about three into the feeder we noticed it leaking from the bottom. The leaks became very pronounced with liquid leaking from three places and becoming almost a steady leak. We are going to turn it upside down and try to glue it all around the bottom. Hope that stops the leaks. Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder"
3,Beware of Leaking!!,"This feeder is great for the size, especially if you have a lot of birds visiting it like we do. The HUGE problem is that it leaks in even the slightest breeze. I'm not sure if it is a design flaw or it just becomes lighter as the mixture is used and is more easily moved in the wind. This leakage also brought in more insects to the area looking for an easy meal. This product would work great in a sheltered area with little to no wind. If you have it open and exposed like we do, I wouldn't recommend buying it."
4,Perky Pet 220,"The Perky Pet 220 is great because of it's capacity but like all other high volume feeders that I have it needs to be burped manually at times. It does have one problem though, sometimes it is a challenge putting it back together after refilling."
2,bear attack,"I got this feeder for use at a cabin in Colorado. On the plus side, it is easy to clean and refill, it does have a conveniently large capacity, and it's coloration attracts a lot of birds. At the same time I bought this, I also bought a different brand feeder locally for 1/3 the price, also large capacity, also easy to clean and load, and also attractive to lots of birds. Shortly after hanging these, they were all attacked by a bear. The cheap ones survived intact, this Perky Pet one did not. For the price, I'd go with the cheaper more bear resistant ones and can get 3 for the price of this one."
1,Don't waste your money,"Please don't waste your money on this feeder. The first one I received had a broken seal and liquid steadily leaked out. I received a replacement, and guess what? It too leaked - the FIRST time they both were filled. This is junk. No more Perky Pets for me, thanks. (I only gave it one star because this sight requires me to rate it - it does not even deserve that)"
3,Leakage problems,"I had some massive leakage problems with this model that attracted a megaswarm of bees. The manufacturer was good enough to send me a replacement base, but I still ended up removing the perches and sealing the entire bottom with Goop. I have never had issues with any other Perky-Pet feeders (and I've had lots), but I wouldn't recommend this particular design."
2,Grand Master hummingbird feeder 48oz.,"We ordered 2, having been quite pleased with their smaller feeders. These, however, both leak. It appears the cylinder and base do not attach tightly enough to prevent leakage. Very disappointing."
2,Just a pretty face,"I bought this stroller because I couldn't afford a Bugaboo and because it looks really cool. The fabrics are really hip and the overall look is stylish. But it was not worth it! I have been disappointed by this stroller again and again. It is bulky, not travel-friendly. I was excited about the flipping handle, but it doesn't push well at all in that position because the wheels rub against the basket. It's really cumbersome to lift over curbs and is rather difficult to maneuver in general.Even with those drawbacks I figured I would keep it and just get a cheap umbrella stroller for travel, but today i was out with it and a bolt fell out of the frame, making it impossible to push up over curbs! I had to carry my 17 pounder 8 blocks home dragging the worthless thing behind me. I'm getting a Graco and hope I am never taken in by looks again!"
3,Hair Show....,"I rented this movie last night to get a good laugh. I can honestly say that I got a few. It is about family relationships and how we all need to get over past grievances with them, no matter how many times they screw over us. Mo'Nique wasn't at her funniest but then again, this movie is rated PG-13. As for the things that go on at a salon, people, these things really DO happen. If this movie came out in the 70's, it would have been called a blaxploitation flick. The movie has several meanings...but, did any of us hear about it going to theatres? It had its funny parts..rent it. I wouldn't suggest adding it to your DVD collection though."
2,Has potential,"I haven't finished this book and actually don't think I will. It started out very intriguing, being based in the future right before the Second Coming. However, having read it half way through and reading the reviews I have to say that it is not something I want to finish. It is very chopping with many holes in it, there are only like 3 paragraphs that cover a huge span of time and that bothers me. The story talks in more detail than I think appropriate about sex, drugs, and evil spirits. It actually creeped me out really bad and I wanted to throw it out of my house. I read another review that says after so much more detail on things than I would like Alyssa doesn't even find religion after the 500+ pages. I don't really write negative reviews but I did not have a good feeling while reading this book."
3,"Great Book, but not that useful on it's own.","WARNING-if you own fields of fire,shadowtech,and the street sam catalog, buy this book. if you don't own them, wait a bit,as the bulk of this book deals mainly with revising the explanations of gear found there....and since FASA is reprinting all of them into one 3rd edition book anyways....... While most players drool and their GM's cringe over the implications of delatagrade cyberware and cybermancy, I found the most useful section of the book to be the various updates on compatibility of implants from previous books('say, CAN I get Muscle augmentation if I have 3 vyberlimbs, and how will that affect my new adrenal pump'?). Dowd's framing technique was very effective and entertaining."
3,Not bad,My granddaughter read through this really fast and was repeating everything I was saying. Hard to believe but she was doing it.
1,Worst book I've read,"This guys says he's a CFP but he souunds more like a stock broker... There are other areas of planning such as tax planning, risk Mgmt, estate planning... What a one-sided view from a CFP"
4,An awesome book,"A simple concise way of managing your money. No fluff and it comes from a man who has done it and helped a lot of people manage their money successfully. He is a self made millionaire, not from writing books, but from actually making and managing money (unlike many other so called financial gurus)"
4,Good Concept,I liked the concept of this book... Moran is also a likeable character who I respected for trying to solve the case without regard to the rules.
5,"AN OUTSTANDING MEDICAL,ACTION,SPY NOVEL","ONE OF THE FINEST BOOKS I HAVE READ. IN THE SAMEVEIN AS JOHN LAND AND CLIVE CUSSLER. THE AUTHORWROTE THIS BOOK AND A SECOND NOVEL ""SCIMITAR""BEFORE HE DIED. I ONLY WISH HE COULD HAVE WRITTENMORE. I READ OTHER AUTHORS IN THE HOPES OF FINDINGANOTHER TALENT EVEN REMOTELY CLOSE TO HIS."
5,Carrier Humidifier replacement Filter,"Buying this filter online is THE WAY TO GO!Apparently these replacement filters are not commonly carried in the large national hardware stores, thus your only solution was to pay a furnace contractor to make a home visit to simply replace these filters, an with their huge costs and the giant mark-up they charge, it was crazy. Plus, we have hard water so we need a new filter about twice a year.I did an internet search and found these filters on AMAZON, and the price was 1/10th the price of a home visit from a contractor!They were cheap enough that I could buy 5 year's worth of filters for the same price as a single visit/replacement from the heating contractor!And these are the exact same filters!They are very easy to install as well."
2,SHARP EDGES,"As all the reviews read (they were right); you better be careful. You could need stitches before you get it unpacked. Eventually found one in the store ""Cheaper"" with non sharp edges"
3,I learned about publishing,"This books teaches you about publishing and literary criticism. It is unlike his other classics like Hawaii and Chesapeake. It won't appeal to everybody, but it was better than I expected and quite informative"
3,Mixed results for Mr. Michener,"If you are interested in the details of the publishing industry, this is a good book for you. Very informative and interesting. If you want a gripping novel, forget about it. If you want well-crafted, believable prose and dialogue, you won't find it here. This is one of Michener's later books, and he clearly was losing it in old age. ""Recessional"" is another example. The dialogue in ""The Novel"" is formal, stilted and unbelievable. To use an oft-repeated Michener phrase from his great novel ""The Source,"" the dialogue here is ""stiff-necked."" It is the dialogue of a stuffy old man. The book is divided into four parts, each ""written"" by four different people: an author, an editor, a critic and a reader. And they all talk exactly the same way! The foursome is addicted to repeated use of adjectives like ""fine"" and ""handsome."" But, as I said, it's an interesting glance into the publishing world."
1,Doesn't come close to others by Michener,I have read many of Michener's books and loved most of them. This one doesn't come close - boring
3,"""...what a novel really is. It's sixty thousand carefully chosen words...""","I expected more from this book, having recently enjoyed Michener's Caravans. But the story was more about the relationship between four interconnected persons in the world of novels than the process of writing, editing and publication of novels (which is what I expected). The four characters are: a diminutive dogged writer of books on the Pennsylvania Dutch; a female editor loyal to her ""little Dutchman"" (even the reference bothered me), a (male) book critic, and an (female) avid reader and fan. Unfortunately, it doesn't get any more exciting than that. Michener does provide some excellent information on the Pennsylvania Dutch and certain aspects of their life, but the story is otherwise a bit dated, dull, and so long (446 pages) as to be tedious at times. Better: Caravans by James Michener and Rumspringa: To Be or Not to Be Amish by Tom Shachtman."
4,Good if you are not seeking 100% whole grain breads,"I checked out this book at the library as I had read a review stating it was a good book for those seeking to bake whole grain breads. It has many good recipes in it; however, the majority (80% in my view) is mostly bread or white flour with a smaller percentage of whole grains. I was disappointed only because I was expecting something different. I attempt not to use white flours and many of the recipes had a higher white flour content than whole grains. The Yeast raised honey cornbread is 100% whole grain and is wonderful. I enjoyed reading the book but still consider Peter Reinhart's Whole Grain Breads the benchmark. This would be an excellent book for those wishing to add some grains to their diet."
5,Must Have SW LEGO,"This X Wing model is a must for any Star Wars Lego collector. The final product is an amazing replica. For adult toy enthusiasts, this model is VERY EASY to put together and would take no more than 15min. The price is a little expensive for the amount of building involved. There are a few moving parts like the wings and two hatches on the fighter(but these have nothing in them).The mechanic train is an enjoyable addition and excited me since it did not use wheels(!).This model is also very durable. This model can be easily displayed."
1,Make sure its what you ordered!,"Nikon are excellent scopes, the problem is that Amazon is advertising and selling a scope that does not exist. Nikon did not make a buckmaster 3-9x50 with the BDC reticle that I can find. Twice now they have sent me one with the Nikoplex reticle. I am very unhappy with amazons CS at this point. Make sure you get the right scope! (two weeks later)Amazon has made things right and did an EXCELLENT job fixing the situation. At this point I have NO complaints and am very happy with things. Thanks Amazon for the good CS."
4,"FAGOR IS NOT MADE IN SPAIN, BUT CHINA","My new 10 qt Fagor was advertised to be a canner, but had no rack or frame for canning jars and Fagoramerica doesn't sell the rack separately at their site. I have all the other tools for canning. It was advertized at Amazon as being made in Spain but it came in a box that said it was made in China. Had I known it wasn't made in Spain I would not have purchased it. It looks stable enough and I need a stainless one to cook in so I guess it's either keep it or spring for a KUHN RIKON. A real letdown. Hope the performance is better than the advertised origin and capability."
2,A lot of grain,That's Entertainment - The Complete Collection [Blu-ray] has a lot of grain. I see better DVD version. I don't understand it.
2,HMMM,I think that the Blue Harvest movie was soo good that they set the bar soo high for the next starwars episode (somthing.....darkside) and the somthing.......darkside was terrible! it was not funny 99% of the time there were a few funny scenes but now enough for me to laugh! I do NOT recomend this product!
5,A really informative book!,I can't wait to use this book during Chinese New Year with my ESOL class! The kids will love it!
3,"Great art, okay story.","Read though this in one sitting and I have to say I enjoyed it, but I felt that I didn't completely buy the characters and their motivations. Beautiful art for the most part. I'd love to see more of this world that feels barely touched on in these few pages."
1,Lame...and useless,Ever heard of Excel or just photocopying your rebates and putting them in a folder or you can even go ghetto and put them into a ziploc bag with the dates you sent them in. I can't believe someone would waste good money for this thing. If you are into saving money and sending in rebate then this is one thing you SHOULD NOT BUY!
4,Let go of expectations and enjoy,"It's not Geoff Dyer's fault that a lot of people seem pick up this book and think they're going to get something else-a travel guide or a memoir or a philosophical treatise. Judging by the reviews, a lot of readers are uncomfortable with something that they can't really pin down. Dyer doesn't help these readers out by flitting around the globe and resolutely refusing to say anything meaningful about anything but his own state of mind. But once you let go of expectations, ""Yoga"" really starts to grow on you, adding up to a pleasant if transitory experience, kind of like an evening with an aging backpacker in a seedy hostel with a bottle of Thai whiskey. Dyer also charms as someone who is obviously staggeringly well-read, yet wears his knowledge lightly and seems to actually live with his favorites, instead of just name-drop. That must be a British thing, because it's rare to find American writers who can pull this off. (...)"
1,Don't bother to read it!,"This book is the printed equivalent of that pretentious bore who corners you at a party and then name-drops from a great height, leaving you battered, bruised and unsure of what, exactly, you did to receive such a fate. Stultifyingly tedious, this book should only be read (if at all) to highlight the fact that one should not judge a book by its cover. Or, indeed, its author, who penned the lyrical, haunting book on jazz, ""But Beautiful"". I bought both books at the same time and, luckily, read ""But Beautiful"" first. I slogged through four or five chapter of ""Yoga"" and then realised that life is far too short to burden my brain with such an uncompelling, non-descriptive, smug, self-love fest as this book. And the reviews on the cover are nothing short of misrepresentation. Can I sue?"
4,Great Book For Teenagers,"I thought this book was really good. I bought it a year ago and I still read through it about once a month, just to keep me in line. It offers great examples to teens and gives a good perspective. John Bytheway is my favorite author and youth speaker and I was glad to have met him over the summer. I encourage parents to buy this for their teens."
5,Priceless,"My first thought, after finishing this marvelous memoir, was, ""He did it better than I ever could have done."" And, with grudging admiration, I began rereading it (at two a.m.!). Mr. Rochlin has conveyed a dimension of truth and reality few writers are capable of managing. I laughed, and I felt tears, and laughed again. I've been there (to be sure, in a different fashion but in the same war and in another war after that one), and through Mr. Rochlin's book I vividly relived some of those days. What is ""priceless"" about ""Old Man"" is that is transcends all generations. And there are layers of meanings to it that reveal themselves with each new reading. This is infinitely more than a ""war book"" because the reader, be he a war veteran or present day high school student, can relate to the author's universal theme of life and death, courage and fear, triumph and tragedy, love and hate. In a word, then, one hell of a fine book."
4,"Fantasy-driven, interesting view of WW11 flying.","""My memory,"" Rochlin writes, ""is accurate and false at the same time."" So, move over Yossarian. This is a funny view of the terror of being a navigator during WW11. As a navigator myself (in the 8th (England) not the l5th in Italy.)..much of the recollection is germaine. Rochlin must be an interesting, ribald and dirty old man. And that's wonderful. Its a quick read, and an ideal book for anybody who flew in those years."
5,Old Man in a Baseball Cap,"It may be impossible for anyone who personally experienced World War II, or whose parents or grandparents lived through those dramatic and traumatic years, to remain unmoved when reading this profoundly insightful memoir of that time by artist/architect/social and political activist/writer and now performer Fred Rochlin.Rochlin here tells stories of his role in that war, when he joined the then Army Air Corps right after Pearl Harbor, at the age of nineteen, and flew some 50 missions over Italy as a navigator on B-24 bombers. It is a story filled with horror, humor, pathos, and great wisdom, and it's told by a man who wrote it when he was 70 years old, but who clearly has never lost the wide-eyed wonder and enthusiasm of that nineteen year old boy."
1,what do readers need?,"What readers need are a story, which requires the skill to analyze, and insight into facts and information. what is the use of piling up all the information there? only researchers who do the story, not the general audience, need your collections of films, radios, etc..., which requires no more than manual labor. if the other biographies are intelligient scholars, this guide to sources is at most an archivist or collectors. do people learn from scholars or archivist or collectors? if this book is as valuable as you said, then the most valuable knowledge producer in the world is librarian or archivist who organize information."
5,Tiny magnets with great big holding power,"These magnets are easy to handle. They are super strong and hold large Christmas photo cards with ease.Have just ordered a second set. Very pleased. I would suggest you invest in either the round PEG or the square PEG style, since they are quite easy to handle. Very pleased."
4,Fun Entertainment,"I have owned this game before, I never got to finish it. I am so glad i got it again. I managed to get further than i was before. What I liked best about this game is that it is 3rd person player. I find 1st person players are more difficult to play, and annoying to manuever."
3,Better than the film by a little,I found Rhett and Ashley to both be much more interesting characters in the book than in the movie. Scarlett though better formed as a character in the book still annoys me. I would have liked to have seen more growth in her but she seems forever stuck at 16. Perhaps that's part of the point of the book.
1,Cheap and broken...,"This locket didn't last two days and my poor daughter - it was the only thing she asked for for Christmas, was heartbroken. The metal was thin and cheap and broke off of the locket. There was no fixing it. Returned it and will never buy jewelry from that I can't hold in my hand again. Sorry Amazon:("
2,Heart Locket,"Didn't like it once I got it. Very small, had to glue the picture in. Would have returned but didn't have time (Christmas present)."
3,OK but needs improvement,"I love the finish on this locket. I do not like the idea of not being able to shrink a picture down to put inside both halves. I bought this for my 5 year old and she loves it but wants pictures inside. I will keep trying, maybe kinko's will be able to do something for me. Just needs to be a little bigger."
2,Unbelievable toy for and unbelievable price,"WARNING! - THIS TOY IS FOR AGE 6+ YEARS (head breaks off easily) Label is misleading (Label says 4 - 9 years)I must say street fighter should be tough, well this street fighter got beaten up within a few hours of arrival. First the leg broke off then the head then my Son stopped playing with it. Just a total waste."
5,Get (at least) one.,"This is maybe my favorite in the current Star Wars Lego lineup. Yes, the rear gunner compartment is a little large, but the number of pieces is really suprising considering how underbuilt some of the current lego sets are. Lots of pieces means more fun for kids and more options for serious builders. Large wing pieces and full-size transparent front and rear cockpit elements are a big bonus, as are the unnecessary wing articulating pieces, many sloped bricks, hinges, and three mini-figs (two pilots and a Hoth ground soldier).Buy a couple. The price is very reasonable, and a fleet of them provides countless building options."
2,Save your money for a new snorkel instead.,"I bought this book during a trip to Bonaire. While it has a useful map and good - not great - photography, it is by no means essential. There is no such thing as a bad Bonairean dive, but if you want details on a site, ask your divemaster. Their replies will be more accurate and up to date. If you are researching a trip, use dive magazines or your favorite dive travel specialist instead"
2,Cuba I Remember You?,"After reading this book...I just need to point out that was not a La-La Land during the Revolution and even presently. I think its nice that Dr.Orbea can remember his own personal pleasant times. I just wonder if he has any idea of what really went on outside of his ""Happy Garden"".....?"
3,"Very good, but dated","This is a classic. One of the most serious earlier works on the topic. Professor Hanson brought a very solid theoretical framework to Web marketing. The book came at a time when we finally all wanted to get more rigouros with the ""New Economy"". I perused it again recently for a seminar I am giving, and it is still an excellent reference book. I would give four stars to an updated edition. I don't know if they are planning it."
5,Wonderful,This book really helped me understand some of the more difficult subjects of internet marketing.
4,Great Book for Small Business Owners,"If you are a small business owner... or especially a struggling small business owner... I would HIGHLY recommend this book to you. It is full of great ideas for simple marketing strategies to increase the success level of your business. If you are not a small business owner, the the first 3 chapters are still quite good but the remainder of the book is a list of 282 tips."
5,Improve your Cashflow NOW,Too many of the businesspeople I've come across say they've tried everything they know to improve cashflow in their business. Basically they run out of ideas and give up. Or place all their efforts into one or two ideas oblivious to all the other opportunities for cashflow. This book contains 100s of ideas to improve cashflow in 5 different areas of your business (did you even know there were 5 areas to work on?). Each idea is rated as to its expected effectiveness. Never be short of cashflow ideas again...
4,Nearly Perfect,"I originally bought this pot for a downsized RV kitchen, everything must be multi functional. But I just love this product. I now use it constantly. Unlike most steamers, the basket has a close weave so it will hold any type of pasta (except orzo). The quality is excellent, the size is just right for my needs, in fact the product is nearly perfect. It looses a star because the handles and lid knob get too hot too touch. There is no way a pot like this is going in the oven, so there is no reason not too have 'cool touch' handles. Buy it, you will love it."
3,Another good read,I am a bit biased because I like reading books written by this author. It is not my favorite but I would put it in my top 5 by Clive Cussler.
2,If you understand the first 50 pages of the book then go ahe,"ad and read it. Personally it was very dificult to understand and had a very slow plot. Therefore i hated the book. The only thing that was good was the evelution of the charicters and the accasionall understandable humor. I might try another of Cussler's books, but i just really didn't llike this one. If you can wait out the very slow plot and understand the humor in it then I say it will be a good book but for a guy like me it was a boring waist of my time. Danke schon und Tchuss!"
5,Who Couldn't Love It?,"Lovely Cd, the song is amazing, deffinitely worth the buy if you're a hard core fan."
1,Don't bother...,"Instrumentally very nice, but the mood is ruined by the singing and stilted lyrics. Pure pablum that doesn't live up to the hype. About as satisfying as light beer."
1,Misleading description,"This blade would not fit my 5/8"" arbor. The adaptor is a cheap washer that does not work with the beveled washers on my radial arm saw. This was one of my few disappointments from Amazon."
1,Waste of Money. You are paying 20$ for a $2 made in China POS,"To be blunt, this ""Easy Clean"" gravel Vacuum is a POS.I have two other cheaper ($5) gravel vacuums, and they work substantially better.The main problem with this premium steaming pile of crap is the one way sipon does NOT work. I do not understand why one should pay $20 for such a product. There are other pumps (biorb mini pump, any Aqueon sipon vacuum) that are *1/4* the price with higher quality build quality AND works *much* better.Currently this waste of money is sitting sitting on the floor shattered in multiple pieces. It has been years since I have felt this frustrated at how something so utterly simple could be this badly designed."
4,Works great on small <5 gallon units,Bought this to clean out my beta tank that is less than 5 gallons. Works great but a little too quickly. Pay attention to the amount drained.
2,Doesn't suck...,"It's been a while since I used a gravel washer but I'm definitely not new to the hobby. The last product I used created a great deal of suction which I felt was necessary to really get all the excess debris near the bottom of the tank easily.Marina's Easy Clean didn't suck as much. I was disappointed as it didn't give me the same satisfaction of ""gravel washing."" Instead, it merely felt adequate as a siphon."
5,Works well.,"This is a very good product. Sucks well, starts to siphon without getting the whole tube in the tank, and doesn't get clogged with the nifty gravel trap. I recommend it."
4,great!,I really like this product! Although it will break... It is cheap and vacuums very well! Like this more than the 25ft I have that connects to the sink (BROKE MY GARBAGE DISPOSAL!!!)
3,Non Fiction,"Batman: The Official Book of the Movie by John Marriott is another product of the 1989 batcraze. A reasonably well done movie type book, with some decent photography and ok written bits and pieces.Something for fans of all things Batman movie at the time, and definitely not a ripoff."
1,Great Poacher - Terrible egg cups!,"We just purchased the Fargo 4 Egg Poacher from Amazon. It came quickly and as indicated. We used it one time and the egg cups are not ""non-stick"" and after washing in the dish-washer the ""non-stick"" coating came off the cups. Therefore it is now worthless - what a deal for Fargo and Amazon - you cannot get replacement cups!! I have purchased a lot of things from Amazon but this Fargo Poacher and Motorolla batteries are a big disappointment. The batteries which were supposed to be ""new"" - one was dead on shipment has just about done me in with Amazon. Too bad, they have not responded to my Emails."
4,looks nice,"I hung this clock incorrectly and it fell off the wall... three times. Still looks and works great. Pretty and simple, which is what I wanted."
3,Thin Metal,The set consists of two pans. The metal is very thin and I suggest you do not make the caramel in the top piece as suggested. It gets extremely hot and is to dangerous to handle. Make the caramel in a heavy saucepan and quickly transfer it to the flan pan. I did like having the flan pan sit in the waterbath pan. The flan did come out great but watch the cooking time. It said to bake about an hour but it should actually go for about an hour and 10/15 minutes. The flan has to sit in very hot water for it to release from the pan. You will have to run a knife around the edges for it to release. The product could be great if the weight of the metal was heavier.
1,"Should be in the ""Fantasy"" section of the book store","Ordinarily, I can't justify buying books by Horowitz, because I'm not paying full-fare for trash.But a bargain bin price at Borders wasn't too bad.Unfortunately for Horowitz, he seems to go from A to Z without much in the way of intervening logic. Ward Churchill has a red phone to Bin Laden. Therefore, everyone who is not right of Pat Buchanan is a traitor."
1,Why divide our country?,"I am a liberal. I am not anti-God, I am not a communist, and I don't hate America.Why do we need another book to polarize this nation? Aren't we already split up enough? Do we have to make it worse?This book has McCarthyism and paranoid schizophrenia written all over it. We don't need more trash like this to whip all the right winggers into a frenzy; because when you have everyone as paranoid as this book makes people, wars could get started. Oh wait, nevermind..."
5,A GREAT READ I bought this on Amazon.com,This book is a GREAT READ It tells what is now going on in the World today.And it will open up your eyes.
3,the canadian standard for pure is NOT 100 %,"to the best of my knowledge Maple syrup from Canada only needs 80% maple to be considered pure. NY 90% , Vermont 100% I wonder if this product ignores Canada's Standard."
3,Buy your own tree,"It's a tasty syrup, as expected. Originally purchased for one of those 'alternative' diet programs, but only used for a condiment. I enjoyed it, bought more than a few initially, but it's an expensive syrup and I'm sure you can find the same for less money."
4,Very good in explaining the subject of death with young children.,"PETA recommended this book and my daughter who is 5 said that it was sad. At the time our cat Johney was on his second surgery and we didnt expect him to live, he did awesome though! A week later my grndfather went into the ICU and the book helped open up a conversation which enabled her to express some of the worries and feelings that she had about death. The book does not go along with our beliefs, but it did help in opening her up to new views which is not a bad thing! I am glad that we have this book and recommend it for young children and thier caregivers."
5,A nostalgic book...,"We lived in a rural area growing up, and we always had outdoor kitties. Every once in a while, a stray dog or coyote would ""get"" a kitty and we would go through the same routine. First, my dad would bury the kitty before we woke up in the morning. Then, my mom and dad would sit us down and tell us that a kitty had died. Then, we went to the library and checked out ""The 10th good thing about Barney."" We would read the book as a family that night and for a few nights after. As a little girl, I was devastated to loose a kitty--I remember being so confused, upset, scared... and mostly just felt so bad for the cat. But this book was always a comfort. Now, I am MUCH older... but we recently lost our very old cat to kidney failure. So I found myself on Amazon...and got myself the 10th Good Thing about Barney!"
1,Nothing good to say about the 10th good thing....,"I work in a school library and as a cat lover am always seeking out the cat books. This one caught my eye and I was expecting something wonderful. I found the story to be hopeless and defeating. How sad the only comfort the father has to offer is composting tips and the last memory the child has to hold is that of a decomposing cat. I'm no censor, but two thumbs way down. Also, if you are looking for something wonderful for pet loss, try Cynthia Rylant's, Cat Heaven!"
1,Newer version of this player out now!,"I only gave a 1 star here because I'm not rating this player just letting people know that there is a new version of this player that's out now it's the DN191H it has a 14 in 2 card reader still slot loading I got it for $129.00 at best buy, will try it out next week and see how things go....It lists as having 14 bit dacs...and it is listed on their web site now."
1,"Not what I exspected, the measurements included the base and I thought it was just the mirror.","Was looking for a large mirror, made of plastic so it would not rust in the bathroom. When I did a search, it placed me on the Amazon, Danielle Ultra, when I read the measurements of this mirror, I thought it was the mirror, not including the base. Needless to say, I am Un-Happy with this. It's too small for what I wanted.I was looking for a large plastic mirror that I use in my bathroom to see the back of my hair when blow drying. This mirror is too small."
4,"Overall good stroller, but hard to fold","Overall I'm pleased with my Bumbleride Flyer for many of the same reasons other reviewers have identified. However, my biggest con is the folding. I am fairly average size person (5'4"", 110 lbs) but I struggle with folding and unfolding. My much stronger husband can easily unfold it open, but I squat on the floor and open one side, then open the other side, then stand up while trying to ""shake"" it open...I feel like a fool every time I open or close it. I've tried my girlfriends' strollers and they are so much easier to open! Also, the catch lock is so annoying. You have to ""open"" it but because of the positioning it still catches while trying to open. Also, I visited my sister in NYC with the Bumbleride and this stroller is NOT for the city. It's too big and bulky for the tiny restaurants, stores and tight hallways and sidewalks, but I didn't buy it for that purpose so it's not a problem for me."
3,"Excellent book, but some information left out.","Mr. Schollander,This is a very good reference and resource for further research and I am very satisfied with your book. But....even though the flatware section had good coverage , the serving pieces were left out. This would include Tomato, Cucumber, Sardine, Fish, Salad, Cake, Macaroni, Ladels, etc, etc, etc. I realize this is not only a silverware book but these items were a very important part of the Victorian table. Please come out with a 2nd printing and a more extensive version.Thank YouSincerely,Keith T. Kalkanoff"
4,Weapon of choice,"I had owned one of these many moons ago. The only problem back in the old days was that the bands broke very easily. I am in hopes that that has improved over the years. It was fun to own then; but now I bought such a thing as a weapon of choice. I must watch too much t.v. but when I see young folks hurling rocks and bottles at people's houses, property, and person I thought, well, you can't shoot them, it's too many for a stun-gun...but a good sling-shooter would be a lot better than a pebble or a bottle because of accuracy and speed of reloading as you can palm 3 or 4 other rounds while you're launching one. I got it simply as an alternative weapon of choice, a tactical solution to a possible fantasy situation."
4,One of the best slingshots I have ever bought,"I own five slingshots nut like this one most. It is powerful and steady, yet inexpensive, with some good features. I like the ammo chamber in the handle particularly. The wrist brace is also comfortable. The suede ammo wrap could be a little bigger and stronger if anything need be improved."
5,INCREDIBLE INSIGHTS,"Not too many books can look into this illness with such empathy and honesty. A thoughtful, provoking read from one of America's finestwriters. For people who want to be informed as well as entertained."
3,Very Cool But...,The chillow does a great job of keeping you cool at night but it is filled with water so its rather heavy. I use it on emergency when the extremely hot nights come lol.
2,Not so good,"I tried this pillow before I purchased another for my sister. I found the Chillow heavy, uncomfortable (too heavy to move easily) and it did not keep the cool like the product review stated. I would not recommend this pillow for anyone looking to purchase something that stays cool while you sleep."
1,Waste of money!,All it is is a soaked piece of foam covered in what seems to be pool material... It stinks and if you don't lay flat all it will do is ball up at the bottom of your pillow case....
1,A cool but leaky idea,"I was very happy when my Chillow arrived. I put it to use immediately and it helped greatly in getting a good night's sleep. If that was all there was to the story, I would have given it 5 stars instead of one. The leaking started a few weeks later and ended up creating new leaks as fast as I could patch the old ones up. The seams are where the leaks occur and I just have a hard time believing that they couldn't have done a better job of plastic welding these together. After a month of struggling with leaks, I trashed it."
2,cooling pillow,"Product didn't live up to the claims, felt heavy to the head and shifted inside the pillowcase during sleep."
5,Amazing,"Just great. I've been suffering for years from the ""turning of pillow"" syndrom. Now I can have a cool night's sleep. Thank you for an amazing product."
3,Works mostly,"the Chillo starts our cold, but by the morning, the area I sleep on is hot ... I'm bald. Maybe this has something to do with it."
4,So Cool,Pros:Great temperature (if you need it cooler put near an open window or in the fridge before bed)Good size for standard pillows (king size pillow I would get larger size)Cons:Inside the pillow case with my pillow it slides around (I put it in it own pillowcase & it helps some)It warms up sooner than I hoped (You can get 2 and put 1 on each side of the pillow or keep a spare on the nightstand)Overall glad I purchased these. It makes my husband & I both more comfortable to fall asleep.
3,Cool doesn't last,"Chillow starts out cool, as advertised, but quickly warms up to body temperature, so that if you need the coolness in the middle of the night, it is already gone. If you want the cool only to fall asleep this will work; it just doesn't last long enough."
2,Not chilly enough for one thing. Poor customer service for another,"I read so many positive reviews before I bought this thing. I should have read the negative reviews too.The Chillow does have a chemical smell to it.If you fill it and burp it right so all the air is out, it is nice and chilly when you lay down to go to sleep. If you remain perfectly still, you should be ok. If you move at all, the Chillow slides all over the place and winds up on other parts of the bed.I would wake up at 1:00 to find my ""Chillow"" had lost its chill and was actually warm :(I sent an email to ""customer service"" and they essentially told me I was stuck with the Chillow no matter how unhappy I was. They will not take it back and will not refund your money.Not happy with this thing at all!"
3,It's okay,The chillow is okay (for a while) - but it's cool comfort is not as long lasting as the product description would have you believe.
1,chill pillow,"I was very disappointed with this product because it was extremely difficult & uncomfiortable to use. It would bunch up while i was trying to sleep. If I moved, the pillow did not move with me. It did not stay cold al;l night. All in all, I wasted my money on this product.Deborah K. Dee, Ph.D."
5,One of the best purchases ever,I purchased this product not really expecting much but it has totally exceeded my expectations. During these extremely hot nights this summer the Chillow has been a godsend. I sleep with a Cpap mask which can be warm on the face. I'm so much more comfortable now. It remains cool until well after I have fallen asleep. I would recommend to anyone who likes to sleep with cool bedding.
1,Useless; does not work,impossible to get air out without spilling a lot of water; lumps developed that could not be flattened; too heavy for use
1,Dont buy,This is a waste of money. It does not stay cool all night. The material inside bunches up and can not be re-flatten
2,Not happy,"I would not recommend this item as it crumbles and folds, etc it does not stay in the pillow and makes your pillow very lumpy."
1,What a scam,"Sounds like this should be a wonderful product, but it doesn't work at all. It doesn't feel cool at all. The pillow, after you get the water in it, weighs a ton. When you roll it up to get the air out of the pillow, a whole lot of water comes out too. I'm extremely disappointed with this. It's back to a bag of frozen peas for me."
1,don't waste your money,don't waste your money i could use a large water bottle and freeze it to getter long coldthe cold wears off about the middle of my sleep cycle then the vinyl gets hot
2,"Very nice, comfortable and works. (Edited review, 4-5 stars)","After tring this for one night I was a tad disappointed because after several hours it loses the coolness, however I am using it under the sheet, laying on it with my back to more evenly disperse the cooling feeling throughout. It is very comfortable to lay on, feels nice, and by the next night its ready to be used again. I have edited this review, I feel that my inital disappointment in the product was unfair, my expectations were very high, I regret rating this only 2 stars, I would give it a 4-5 now and would recommend this to others."
2,Like laying your head on ice,"Chillow worked just as promised, but was FAR too cold. My face was numb within the first few minutes of use. I tried covering it with pillowcases of various materials and textures, with towels, and so on - it was always too cold or too hot. It's a great idea but I think there are probably very few people who can actually use this item."
3,Chillow Pillow,"I ordered 3 on 12/17/06 for Christmas presents & paid for expedited shipping to receive by 12/23/06. I received only one. The other two were sent after New Years - and I was made to feel like I was trying to get something for nothing. I would rate the company as poor.The pillow itself is basically as advertised. However, if you are familar with a waterbed, the Chillow is the same basic concept without a heater - all of the disadvantages (removing air bubbles) along with the advantages (absorbs body heat). As far as help with night sweats, it IS better than getting up and putting your head in the freezer."
2,not my favorite,Works good at keeping your head cold but very uncomfortable in pillow and if it folds over itself its impossible to make it flat again.
3,take one to know one,The Author of this book is an expert on both sides. Having experence in the DA office where he was a criminal and now as a judge a job that I am sure he continues to twist the truth.
1,Didn't ring a bell(chime) in our house!,"Start with the customer-defying plastic packaging (too frequent these days,apparently predicated on products being delivered by drop from an overhead air freighter). Then get out the magnifying spectacles and your minitool for use when you attempt to set the switches(jumpers) in both the chime and the pushbutton to attain one of those 100+chime tones supposed to be attainable for your personally programmed delight. Leave it forthe skilled factory assembly. I didn't bargain for doing this sort of stuff and I didn't end up with anything useful for my front door."
1,exploitation photography,"An exploitative excursion through streets inhabited by the down and out, with possible appeal likely limited to social voyeurs seeking a glimpse into the sorrow of others. If the latter is not your thing, avoid this product, with indulgence in its contents at the risk of an onset of queasiness."
2,Lacking the magic,"As a follow-up on Dan Ablan's excellent ""Inside Lightwave [6]"" book, I must say I set my expectations high to this release. And I was very disappointed. The part on expressions was helpful, but the rest just didn't cut it. In 1995 the content would have been magic, but in 2001 it sure isn't. The end results of the tutorials just doesn't look good enough. Browsing through the book looking at the images really says it all. Sorry, Mr Ablan, you didn't create any magic with this one. When you name your book ""Magic"" we want David Copperfield, and you give us the old rabbit-in-a-hat trick. Please make it up to us next time... ;-)"
3,Fagor 10-Inch Silicon Gasket,"Item delivered promptly, No packaging other than Amazon envelope. Was purchased as a backup spare part; not sure, sealed in large zip lock bag, will last any longer than the original part that came with cooker."
4,Good but not as good as the book,"This workbook is helpful and helps generate creative teaching ideas. However, I didn't find it as helpful as the actual history book itself. Good for people who needs ideas on how to make history fun and fresh for little kids."
5,Great Time Saver,"I guess we could all put together enough coloring and activities to go along with Story of the World Vol. 1, but some of us have other things to do. My kids enjoyed the activities. We certainly didn't do all of them and we tended to go with the more hands on. The Nile Delta was a big hit as was the pyramid. The instructions were simple enough to be adapted if we needed to do that... I see that as a plus. My kids are not into coloring, but there were plenty of other ideas to choose from. I am sure that your kids might get bored if you had them do EVERY SINGLE THING, but as a former classroom teacher, I recognize a resource that is well thought out and designed to appeal to a variety of learning styles."
5,A must-have companion,"This is a must-have for going through the Story of the World series. My favorite part is the ""continued reading"" recommendations. I'd suggest not trying to do all the activities. We started out that way and it was taking forever.I do have her do the map exercises for every chapter and try to read at least one of the recommended books (often a fairy tale/myth/legend picture book about that time/culture). When she's very interested in a chapter, we'll spend more time and do a project or two and read more of the books."
3,It's OK,"As a Christian Mom who is homeschooling using a classical model, I thought these would fit the bill for our history lessons. I am dissapointed with the amount of errors here. There are Biblical errors, many, that I have to correct with the children (like that Abraham laughed and laughed when God said he would have children, but it was not Abraham...it was Sarah.) We have found issues with dates, names and other details besides the Bible references. It's fun to listen to, but I am wondering if it is worth it if I cannot trust the accuracy of the material."
2,Not good for us.,"This looked good to me, but my daughter had the final decision, and she said the projects weren't interesting enough to spend the time on. So, make your own decisions. It depends upon the type of projects you like to do. Busy-work is not our cup of tea, evidently."
4,A Bulls Eye for collectors,"This ref book is must have for all new collectors of the best pistol ever made. The Colt 1911 and later version 1911A1 and it's other makers such as Remington UMC, Ithaca, Singer, Remington Rand, US&S and others helped this nation become the world leader that it is today. Thank you Charles W. Clawson for your research and attention to detail."
4,"Not a Classic, But Close","I liked this novel a lot. Though not as good as her own Sea Priestess and even The Winged Bull, this novel, typical of Fortune's fiction, as a darkness and occult wisdom to it without pigeonholing herself or its audience into it. The problem with today's generation is that they got progressively worse as time went on, and more and more incompetant. The occult fiction genre reached a bad low around these times with the dread Necronomicon recieving a new release. Fortune didn't make pompous aspirations like any Necronomicon, didn't codify the occult into a religion like the Church of Satan, it wasn't a hoax like Crowley. Basically, I like it because it keeps it more reality based with an engrossing plot and believable characters while retaining the humor of suckering you out of money for enteratinment. Fortune and this novel is to be commended with knowing the occult and not just walking on thin ice."
4,OK product. Cheap backing to hold pictures.,"The coaster in itself is fine. It's just a little square of glass. Cute.The legs are just small polymer bumps. Not much shock absorption or grip.The only con is that the backing that holds the picture is just a piece of paper. I don't recall what holds the paper there (probably glue), but it was very flimsy and I can see it coming undone over time. I expected a plastic slot. If you spill your beverage, or this backing happens to get wet, it may ruin the pic-holding ability of the coaster.At this price it is a buy for me.If anyone is confused, only 2 coasters are included in each package/purchase. No holders included. The pic shows 3 which is a little misleading."
4,Real Vietnamese (almost),Simple Art of Vietnamese CookingThis is my second copy. I gave my first copy away to a friend who loved the recipes. The only problem I have with the book is the substitution of easy to find equivalents for the harder to find Asian ingredients. I eaten at the authors' family restaurant for over 20 years. Numerous friends have shared this experience.
2,Choppy Story & Frustrating Read,"I did not enjoy reading this book aloud to my two preschoolers AT ALL! The text just didn't flow and the pages were not balanced well (some having very little text and quite a bit.) The story was just awkward--choppy, if you will.I gave it a second chance, but it was so irritating that two pages into the story my enthusiastic voice was replaced by a barely disguised irritated voice. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Cute word-play just wasn't enough to carry this poorly written book.I don't think we'll look into the rest of this series."
2,"Not quite for 10"" kitchenware","The pans arrived on time and in good shape, although they are not quite 10"" in diameter. All pots and pans purchased in the US have an inside diameter slightly over 10 1/8"". The sealing rim of the cover is only 10"", thus it either precariously balances almost inside the pot or pan - if the container has a slight edge roll making it narrower inside - or it just slowly drops inside the pan or pot. It works passably for aluminum dishes if they are a bit banged up and out of round; the crooked circumference keeps the lid from falling in. As a product the lid is good, but not for American kitchenware standards. It is obvoiusly a European 25 cm standard.Live and learn.For use with European kitchenware I'd give it a 'five star' rating. For US products - buy it only if you are in desperate need - **."
1,No Blackberry Enterprise 4.0 Support,"Since Cingular merged with AT&T; and are now offering the 7290, the service is poor and the phone not compatible with corporate Blackberry Enterprise Server (BES).Cingular no longer makes the older AT&T; 7280 Blackberry available but AT&T; Wireless continues to offer great support for the 7280 and support for BES 4.The 7290 does not fully support the latest version of BES 4.0. Unlike AT&T; and other wireless vendors, Cingular has not released BlackberryOS 4.x so integration with BES 4.0 is very limited."
4,"A litle dinky, but price was so great I cannot complain","There are rhythm sticks out there that are a little longer and sturdier, but they are more than twice the price. I needed a lot of these and they fit the bill beautifully. Great value for the price, just not the nicest you'll ever find."
4,Getting all the paint out is hard,"Love these paints. They are great for quick projects. The colors are vibrant and it doesn't make a lot of air bubbles in the finished product. My only complaint is that when you get down to the last bit of color it's hard to get out. The black is thicker so that it can be the edging, and it's starts to hurt my hands to squeeze out the last bit of paint. I'm not old either. So if you have any kind of arthritis in your hands just keep that in mind when starting project. I have to stop after a few minute when I'm low on black paint and give my hands a rest."
4,Great Creative project!,"I love this window art! Great product, the only complaint I have is that it is easy to go through the paint bottles very quickly so it is best to order an extra refill kit!"
1,"Dull, dull, dull","Simple writing is a good thing. Simplistic writing isn't. This book tries hard--HARD--for ""breezy"" and funny and, partially because it tries so hard, it comes off a lot closer to ""leaden"" and excruciating. The first person narrator is so poorly drawn, and downright grating, it's impossible to appreciate any kernel of a good idea buried in here.It's a waste of money, but at least it is a quick read, so it's not much of a waste of time."
1,Horrible Don't Waste Your Money,"This was one of the worst books I have read in my life. The storyline is bad, all the book has to offer are the South Asian stereotypes. Please don't waste your money."
1,Waste of time and money.,Perhaps if I were 13 or younger I'd have some appreciation for the book. It was on beyond superficial. It reads like a comic book.
4,What happened to the good ol' days when books made you LOL?,"Loved this book - it's an insanely quick read though - finished it in half a day, so if you are looking for a book to be around for at least a week, this is not it! I'd suggest it for a flight. I'm pretty sure 90% of 2nd generation 'model minority' South Asian American women approaching or already in their 30s will relate to this book. I.E., it's best audience is a very specific demographic Regardless, this book literally gets funnier and funnier with each page you turn. The character's inner monologue and ego is so ridiculous that it's charming, and um, reminded me of my friends that grew up in the OC. ;-)"
5,This guy deserves a medal !,"Excellent book. Purely excellent. I couldn't put it down. Read it in one sitting.The author bares his soul in this story of family and unconditional love. While taking care of an ill parent, Mr. Eide deals with every twist and turn that life handed him - and he does it with courage and grace.In this book, everything is laid out for the reader (and the world) to see. But that is also what makes it such an enjoyable book to read as we can all relate.I loved this book, and you will too."
1,Put this album in the dollar store,"One of the all time lows in my life having wasted money on this CD. Avoid at all costs, I'm gonna record over this junk like a Maxell."
4,Solid Chuck-ness,Great collection of some of the cheesiest Chuck movies out there... you get just what you expect from these: unbridled roundhouses and twin 9mm uzi action... enjoy.
5,A must have for anyone who likes Action movies,"The Chuck Norris movies is a must see, for everyone that are consider an action movie fan,Highly recommended specially to share with the friends from the 80's."
3,"Good, With Reservations",I got the pots a couple days ago. They look fine. I used it last night to steam asparagus and that was fine except the glass lid has a tiny steel grommet of a hole for steam relief. With the lid fully on the excess steam escapes via that hole which is too small for the size of the pot and steam created and as a result tends to spray water droplets all over your stove top unless you crack the glass lid open slightly. Other than that it is pretty good stuff.
5,Very nice set,Like having the new tools and extra divider for the canner and the book has been nice to read through also.
3,Fagor Home Canning Kit,"It was packed well and arrived quickly, but I thought the canning rack was going to be for a large 23 qt. water bath canner and it is for a small pressure cooker..maybe 6 qt size? I think it would be helpful to let people know the size of the canning rack in the description. I did need a jar lifter, not sure how much I will use the other stuff."
4,BEWARE THE PIT AND THE PENALUM,"You just can't go wrong with Vincent Price. He really gave his all in this movie along with John Kerr. The film is (..)worth watching with being buried alive and almost being sliced up by the pendalum. The end is the best part,but you relly have to watch the whole thing to understand it. (...) A powerful cast with a great film"
5,Fall of House of Usher,"I grew up with watching horror greats like Peter Cushing and Vincent Price. The Fall of the House of Usher brings to life Poe's timeless classic. If you enjoy ""oldies but goodies"", this is the movie for you."
5,Legendary series of films,"Working within the confines of miniscule budgets and tight shooting schedules, Roger Corman somehow managed to stamp his signature on this unique series of movies - so successfully, in fact, that their visual flair, morbid atmosphere, and European sensibilities have continued to influence film-makers ever since. This is pre-slasher movie horror; think grand, dream-like and magnificent. A must-have edition."
4,"good, classic, creepy, cheesy","A wonderful classic, well worth the viewing; I remembered getting a good chill out of The Pit and the Pendulum one Halloween in high school, and it still does the trick."
1,What a disappointment !!!!!!!!!!!,It may be my fault that I assumed that the heating element and the cooking pan are not attached to each other. Based on all the pictures and descriptions I have seen it seemed like you can easily put the pan with leftover food in the refrigerator. But from the looks of the whole design it seems like you have to empty the leftover food into another container or else you are going to spill the food all over the kitchen counter or the the floor if you try to take the cooking pan out of that white base. I wish the heating element was part of the white base instead of the part of the cooking pan.I desperately want to buy Aroma type cooking pan. But I will have to keep looking.
5,"A ""must read"" for all dressage enthusiasts!!!","Steinbrecht's treatise on dressage training is as relevant today as it was the day it was written. In this day & age of ""do-it yourself"" mentality it's more important than ever to have the dressage training system codified by an author who was not only a rider/trainer, but also a veterinarian. This genius book illustrates that utilizing a proven training system will lead to a better educated horse & rider, and will keep the horse useful for a longer period of time."
5,Winter Spectacular!,"I don't know about everyone else, but when I listen to this album, it moves me. I cannot help but feel energized by some of the upbeat pieces, and filled with a feeling of peace with the slower solice pieces. I highly recommend this album to anyone that just loves good music!"
5,Amazing!,"Even though it's called ""Winter"" Serenade, it is one of my favorite albums all the year long! A classic on my CD shelf! Buy it!"
4,CJ-5 Supertop,"Overall I am pleased with my new Supertop. There is, however, room for improvement. The instructions could use some updating, and clarification. They keep referring to an installation video that does not exist. The brackets that go on the windshield have to be modified to fit properly. The screws for the windshield do not work, you have to drill and tap the internal hinge brackets. All that said, after fighting a few issues, it looks fantastic on my CJ-5! Looking forward to many years of enjoyment. Buying this on Amazon saved me about $200-$300."
3,An OK Read-Not Up To The Standards Of Author's Other Works,"This is the second novel in the author's Englishman in Texas trilogy. The second novel is not as good as the first, and, in no way, compares to the author's Texas series. This is the story of Harry, sent to Texas from England to learn about life by his father. Harry pursues Jessye, but only for sex. Due to his upbringing he has no heart left to give. One of my problems with this book is Harry's whining over his upbringing. I never heard a man whine about the lack of love in his childhood, and I hope I never do - it is a real turn-off!There are plot twists and a lot of unbelievable coincidences throughout this book. I don't want to give anything away, so I won't describe them. My general complaint is that things became very unbelievable and really hurt the plot of the book.In summary, this is an enjoyable book, but it is not a keeper."
2,Not a PHP4 Book,"As another reviewer pointed out, this book was written when php4 was in beta. Despite it's title, this book is NOT a PHP 4.0 book. The extension of every example file throughout the book is .php3. The authors even present a round-about way of maintaining state using the uniqid function and rewriting the url. ??? If you're using PHP3 or if you don't mind filtering out the PHP4 relevant information, you might find this book useful, otherwise look at PHP4 Programming and/or the O'Reilly books."
4,It was a little too big.,I printed out their hat-sizer thing and cut it out according to the directions. My hat ended up being just a little too big. I threw it in the washer and the dryer (even though the tag said not to) and it shrunk enough to fit pretty well now actually...and it still looks fine.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO CARD,When I first put this card in my computer I was delighted with the quality. So why the 1 star? After about a month the crashing started. To get an idea of how annoying and frustrating this is have a family member randomly come in and reset your computer when you are doing anything with video. I cant express enough how much I truly hate this video card and I assure you next paycheck I get I will be purchasing something more reliable and this card will be meeting my 12lb sledge hammer.
2,Your body will only adsorb 500mg / 8hrs,Your body will only adsorb 500mg / 8hrs ... the fizz must only work if you dissolve 2 tablets into 4 ounces of water as per directions
2,insightful but judgemental,"I FOUND THIS BOOK INSIGHTFUL AND HELPFUL,BUT AT THE SAME TIME JUDGEMENTAL. I REALLY APRECIATED THE APPROACH JOYCE LEVINE TAKES IN HER BOOK A BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO ASTROLOGICAL INTERPTRETATION AND IN HER CASSETTE TAPES ON PLUTO,NEPTUNE,URANUS,SATURN AND JUPITER(THEY COMBINE MEDITATION WITH INSIGHT INTO PLANETARY CYCLES).SHE BELIEVES A PERSON'S ASTROLOGICAL CHART ISN'T GOOD OR BAD--IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS--LIKE ONE'S GENETIC PATTERN."
2,no good,"After getting a sample of the orange flavored EC. I thought that would be good idea to try the Pomegrnate.Big mistake. It has no taste and i gave a feeling. I should have read the review by Phillip Goodwin/Irregular Heart Rates and palpitations.I think it's an OK product at best for a cold or the flu. But the taste is nothing like the orange i had and the risks are something to be afraid of. I would send it back but the cost of shipping would be about the amount i paid for it. I'll just have to trash it, I'll try something else. So much for a good thing."
2,original cranberry-raspberry was better,"The nutrients and health benefit is outstanding in all the regular Emergen-c. I may be mistaken but I believe there used to be a cran-raspberry flavor a few years ago. It was one of my Dad's and my favorite flavors. This cranberry-pomegranate isn't nearly as good. It isn't really bad, just odd and not pleasant.The only flavor I can recommend now is the pink lemonade, which tastes good with no off flavor or aftertaste, though I hesitate to call it natural tasting. It's the only flavor I would buy again."
2,BBQ USA,"It was surprising to find a 3 inch thick cookbook which contained so few, useful recipes. Out of the 425 recipes included, I came away with 2 or 3 that I try consistently. I also found the general Barbequing advice and tips to be fairly common knowledge. With the ability today to look up any recipe online, the era of the published cookbook may be near an end. In order for a cookbook to be worthwhile, it must offer something truly unique. Unfortunately this one doesn't."
4,cooking,"this was a christmas present, i bought for myself, so i haven't really checked it out but i did read some of the recipes, and i can't wait to try some. we really like barbeque."
3,Tread Carefully Here,"This book is entertaining. It has a lot of pictures and some history. However, the accuracy of what is being said is not that good. I am from Memphis and I barbecue just like all my friends. Some of my friends have won state championships and we all love to try out the various barbecue joints around town, so I know Memphis barbecue. This book says that Memphis cole slaw is mustard-based. I've only had that about once in my life. As he goes on to talk about Memphis barbecue I can tell he has never done more than spend a night here. Everything else he says may be accurate, but.... the stuff about Memphis is just made up out of whole cloth."
2,A major disappointment. Unworthy of it's artists.,"Boring. A major disappointment given the other Morgan/Sheen entries in this Tony Blair Trilogy. The actor who plays Gordon Brown looks like his twin -- unfortunately, he delivers his lines like Brown's twins as well: mostly mumbled, with head down, a perpetually dour and sour appearance, and a hair-tug. No sense saying more. It's a flop on every level."
4,The Composite Guide to Field Hockey,"The Composite Guide to Field Hockey is a great book for players, coaches, or officials who want to gain a deeper understanding of the game. As an official, I must keep myself up-to-date on all of the new rules of sports, and know not only the rules but how each sport is played. Any referee planning to officiate a field hockey game should read this book!"
3,"Pretty Plain, no picture doesn't help","I bought this toy, and it had a ""no picture new Item"" showing for the picture. I figured with Episode I, I couldn't go wrong. I was mistaken. It contains no figures, it is pretty plain, and does not have any extra features other than the wings move. I would not recommend this for any lego enthusiasts, maybe for beginners it might not be so bad."
1,Never Again,This Sally Hansen Tanner Spray product from Amazon is horrible. I was sent product that is either out of date or shelf life. The tan color is terrible and orange after applied.Used this product for many years that I bought in a regular store and is nothing like this. You can get a great sunless tan with natural looking color if you buy this from a store and not at a cheap price from Amazon.Never again....should have known better when the price was so cheap. This will make me question whether I buy anything from Amazon again.
5,A friend of mine uses the product and rates it highly.,"I showed the above critical review to a friend who is completely satisfied with the product and she says there could be two possibilities: she has oily skin and the product works well with such. However, if a person has dry skin they may find the product does not work that well. Also, there are variants of the product that do not work well for her (she was thinking of the face only version of the product) that may have been what the reviewer had in mind. In any event, it does work well for some people so check it out before purchasing."
4,Great Product,Check on Swanson's site to make sure you're getting the best deal. Sometimes they offer 2 for 1. The product is a great source if you're looking for an antioxidant.
4,Ben 10 Again,"How many of these can my son watch, I guess 8 and already looking forward to the next one, he loves this stuff"
2,I just think it's too heavy,I've been collecting All Clad for years. This is the first pan I don't like. It's really really heavy for a small roaster. My larger All Clad roaster doesn't seem as heavy. I guess it's because the petite Roti is not tri-bonded with aluminum. As for making gravy with the drippings - that CAN be done. I did it with my larger pan even though the bottom is raised a little bit. I put the pan on gas burners and used a whisk & flour. Gravy turned out fine. I haven't made gravy with the nonclad petite roaster yet. If it turns out crummy I'll edit this post. I like the size of this roaster and that's about it.
3,pill form would be better,"While I found this product works well, it is problematic to take. If you try to put it some liquid it won't desolve without a VERY LONG wait. I ended up having to just put it in my mouth and washing it down with juice. The only good thing is it has absolutly no taste. I will be trying the capsule formula next bottle."
2,decent new-age; NOT Native American,"Interesting compositions, but I would personally not call them Native American (perhaps Native influenced). ""Carrying Native music in it's arms while walking into the future""? Give me a break! I see Native Music AS the future! It doesn't **need** new-age permutations. BUT, if you really go for contemporary Native sounds I recommend R. Carlos Nakai or Robert Tree Cody. If you prefer traditional, try either of the two above or Paul Zimmer. Or attend a pow-wow in your area, many fine ""unknown"" artists play pow-wows and sell privately released tapes and CDs."
3,Sling shot ammo,"Me, Son-in-law and grandson shot up a bag of these. They were very difficult to hold in the pouch of a slingshot by me and the son-in-law with it almost impossible for the 11 yr. old grandson. They were real fast and went a lond distance (when you weren't looking for them in the grass) with very good accuracy. Switched to some 1/2"" marbles and had a lot better luck holding and shooting them."
5,Awesome Read!,"I stumbled onto this book and I am so happy I did. Really good mystery mixed in with horror and suspense. What I liked most was Marty's special powers and being able to see visions of the past just from touching an object. Definitely recommend this book, particularly for fans of fantasy and horror."
4,For young and old...an adventure!,"Although Marty Boggs is a school age boy, his story has ageless appeal. I like the characters good and bad. I didn't get a sense of the father at all but he is rarely around so that is okay. The adventure centres around Marty and his friends and it is a page turner. I loved the archaeological stories of the grandfather seen through Marty's eyes and would have liked more of those but this story was more specific and attuned to a particular site and what arose from it. I am hoping for more stories. I want to know what happens next. I am still wondering how he pulled off saving himself in the end (or did he?)... it just said that he did and that was all. I also loved his special ability and would like to see how that develops, there will be more books about Marty Boggs I hope!"
4,As described,As described meets every expectation. Show nicely against white and tinted paper.Saves much time when used with a T square
4,Not to bad for beginners,"This book gives readers tips and techniques on jewelry making and beading. The step by step directions with diagrams were helpful to show what the authors were trying to get across to the readers. The book also gives projects that you can try along with color photos of what the pieces are suppose to look like when completed. The last section of this book gives tips on how to turn this hobby into a business. Overall, it was a very informative book and I would recommended buying a copy. But, I did find a few things wrong with it. There were a few typos in the book and two of the chapters are the ten reasons or tips for something or another but there are only nine reasons or tips."
3,Bead making for Dummies,"I just read this book after sitting in my closet. I thought it would help with my bead making and it did to an extent, but what really helped me was taking beading classes. I suggest taking live hands on classes before buying the book. After I took the classes I could understand more of what the book was actually talking about because I saw it first. If you can read and know exactly what's going on then this is for you. If you need visual and hands on then I suggest the classes."
1,Cheap,"Very pretty earrings. Unfortunately, the posts broke off on transit and were so small I couldn't reattach them. I've been very disappointed in my Amazon jewelry purchases overall."
1,Careful Parents....,"I bought this book for my 15 yr old son. I wanted a book that would help prepare him to avoid the traps of pornography and sexual promiscuity that are rampant in our culture.Fortunately, I scanned the book before I gave it to him and found it to be full of graphic and titillating descriptions that are pretty blunt for a kid who is not sexually involved. My husband and I mutually decided this was not the book for us. I am not a prude- we talk very openly with our kids about sex and have for some time, but this book puts useless graphic images into a kids head. Don't we get enough of that at every turn?I highly recommend ""How to Ruin Your Life by 40"", by Steve Farrar. Awesome book for teens! This author also wrote ""Point Man""."
4,Good Product,"The finish is fairly close and not noticeable to anyone but the owner. The fitment of the top is not perfect and the factory reused pocket on the bottom rubs slightly.Purchased product for a friends car, but for the price I would not hesitate to purchase again, even for my own car.Overall a very good product. Satisfied."
1,OMG SKIP IT,"I have purchased several tracks from different compilations from this series today. STAY AWAY from this one because it BLOWS. The song has been sped up so fast you feel like you are at a Minnie Mouse concert and if not, the song is so bubblegum you will get diabetes listening to it. STICK with compilations 5 and newer. The era compilations 70's, 80's etc. are NOT included in this review."
3,Essential part of the collection,"The characters that come with this set are available with seveal other sets, but I purchased this set anyway. I purchased it before some of the other sets were available, and it does add some ""background"" to my collection of figures and ships. I'd sure make it part of my collection, but let the kids have the extra set of figures ;)"
2,Nose hole is wierd!,"not a bad product but the nose hole doesnt fit right , i had to cut it a bit with a scissors."
4,Nice!,"Plain black with velcro in the back. Happy I bought this one. It was a great price too. This is an adult size. If you want this for a kid, don't buy it. Find a youth size."
3,For Obi-wan,"I only got this for Obi-wan Kenobi(young) since it's the only set he's in. He's my favourite character. Didn't Obi-wan, Qui-Gon sand jar jar sat in the same cockpit in the movie? Well in this set they are seperated. It really doesn't go with other lego starwars sets because it's the only marine vehicle and have no compony, they should linclude a big ""gooba fish"" to attack them. once again THIS SET IS THE ONLY SET YOUNG OBI_WAN KENOBI IS IN!!!!! Jar Jar and Qui-gon is in so many sets but Obi-wan is only in this one, what is wrong with the lego designers?get it for obi-wan..."
1,Dangerous,"This pan is dangerously unbalanced, especially when it sits on certain kinds of burners. If you have a gas stove and your burners have open spaces in the grillwork (most do) the pan can (and will) tip very easily. I just spilled tomato sauce down the front of the stove using this pan. Be careful!"
3,"Not bad, but not amazing","Pretty good music. Not speedy enough for my liking, but it's still angry enough for me to get into. Maldito is definately the best song on here, in my opinion. I haven't heard any of their other work, but would consider looking into it."
4,Iolanthe,"Great! A marvelous satire of Victorian politics. Iolanthe, a fairy, has a son, Stephon, who is half mortal and cannot marry his true love because the entire House of Lords is in love with her too! To revenge themselves on the Peers, the fairies put Strephon into Parliament and arrange it so every bill he chooses is passed into law."
2,Disappointing,"I feel compelled to dissent from the glowing comments I've read here. I've tried 5 recipes, only one of which I'd make again (Bernachon's Biarritz); the other four varieties went into the trash. I bake extensively and have many cookie books, and to be fair, find most of them hit or miss, but this book is one of the most mediocre I've encountered both in range of recipes and results. The binding is doing fine, though."
5,Simply the very best to be had.,"My husband and I make neary 1,500 cookies from this book each Christmas: To give as GIFTS!. We make about 12 dozen cookies of 12 to 13 varieties, then pack tins with one cookies at a time, from each variety, unitl the tins are full. Everyone always returns the tins when they are empty, so that we'll remember them next year! However, the publisher ought to be SHOT. We thought our copy was falling apart due to over use, but I can see from this page, that everyone else has the same problem!"
2,Boring.......,"This book is dated, as are the pictures and recipes. It includes recipes for things like lemon bars and gingerbread and magic bars. Unimaginative stuff from the 50's that can be found in every cookie book, on every website, in my mother's ""special"" recipe file and probably her mother's too. It's not Rose's fault she wrote it 20 years ago, but unless you are new to baking or very limited in your tastes, look for a newer, more modern cookbook. The pictures have that sort of yellow 80's tungsten haze over them that is so unappealing. In the age of digital, it's time for an update!"
5,Rose is the best!,"I have enjoyed Rose's other baking books because she makes recipes do-able for bakers who have varying levels of knowledge and ability. I love to cook and bake but some cookbooks I've bought along the way seem to go out of their way to make their recipes a bit difficult, or have a snooty approach to ingredients and technique (like...it's practically a crime to re-roll cookie dough scraps!). This book has recipes that any of us can bake, no matter how much experience we have - everything I've ever made has turned out to be attractive AND tasty! A practical, beautifully illustrated book that you'll return to use each Christmas, or whenever you're in the mood to bake cookies. A great gift if you pair it with some cookies you've made yourself!"
5,My favorit cookies book ever !!!,"everything that i made was a success, my favorite is the butter toffee crunch i made it as a Christmas gift for the family they fell in love too !!!"
5,Thoroughly entertaining!,I am not a TV fan! I watch DVDs in my own time and just loved this pair as Sherlock Holmes and John Watson! Sooooo sad when the third episode ended and cant wait to pick it up when the next series is released!
5,Each episode is as rich as watching a full length movie,Best money I ever spent on a t.v. series. The plots are rich and detailed and run seamlessly from one to the next. The actors and actresses are outstanding and compelling. It makes me want to nominate it for an academey award or award at the Cannes film festival. When you are done you feel like you watched a brilliant movie at the movie theatre. I can't recommend it highly enough. It's better than the Holmes movies.
4,Worth the time,"Excellent modern adaptation. Strange, witty, and never boring. Certainly worth the time. Tries to be a little too clever at times and doesn't give the viewer much of a chance at solving the puzzles--unlike the original stories. Still, high-quality mystery with a very modern feel."
4,Excellent new interpretation,"This series will not be to every traditionaliats heart, but I really enjoyed this new take on an old favourite."
5,Holmes Rocks!,I decided to try it on Netflix today.. not like I don't have about a million tv shows I'm watching.. but alas had to try it and love it! I can't believe I waited this long! I have only watched the 1st episode as I like to break shows up since I have so many. But I tell you I'm excited to keep on watching and recommend this show for sure!
5,Sherlock,"This is a BEAUTIFUL adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes mysteries, and I'm a long-time fan of the original books and earlier movies featuring Basil Rathbone, Jeremy Brett, and others.I was delighted to be able to purchase the DVD so soon after the mini-series premiered in this country. The quality of the DVD itself was just fine, and I look forward to the next series from BBC/Masterpiece Mystery next September!"
5,Terrific,"If you haven't seen this get it. And get it for someone else too. Great gift. Cumberbatch is fantastic as Sherlock. Smart, witty and appropriately odd. Martin Freeman (The Office) gives a multi-dimensional Watson. His story is as compelling as Sherlock's. The writing is first rate. The show is very inventive and looks great."
5,Brilliant Show! Typical over-inflated BBC price :(,"As many ppl have already said, this show is amazingly well-crafted, featuring witty, clever dialogue, genuinely interesting plots (although the climax in the first ep will probably be guessed by the audience before on-screen Sherlock cracks it), and really, really charismatic actors.The only downside i can see is that, like all BBC shows, this is definitely expensive. By my calculations, for this price, you can get at least 100 mins more of programming in other, US-based shows -- now whether the quality is equivalent, is really up to you ;)ps: I haven't bought the dvd yet (i saw the series on tv), so i can't comment on the extra features, etc.Summary: If you don't mind the fact that there are only 3 90-minute episodes in this 'season', snap it up! Otherwise, it might be better to wait for a cheaper anthology (although the doctor who's (from 2005 onwards), still remain as pricey as ever)."
4,Sherlock Holms,"I enjoy the series but was disappointed there were so few programs per season. Nevertheless, they are well done mysteries."
2,you call 3 episodes!!,"Good show but not worth 23 dollars for three episodes! And since PBS plays them for free set your dvr and get them without commercials.hey BBC quit sending overpriced and counting the commentary episodes as run time to pad ""series"" as you call them. It's a crap thing to do!"
5,GREAT FUN!,"I really enjoyed this adaptation, especially considering I'm a bit of a Jeremy Brett fanatic. I'm also a former English teacher, so I like to see literary adaptations done well. This, indeed, was one of those well-done adaptations. The chemistry between Cumberbatch and Freeman was great. And Holmes and Watson were definitely still alive in these two actors. It was a lot of fun to watch. I will definitely purchase this DVD."
2,Too modern,Sherlock Holmes was not made for the 21st century. I hated the modern verison. Didn't even watch the second part.
5,Sherlock character not perfect but still darn good,"The Sherlock character grew on me but still was more socially inadequate and hyper than I thought he should be. The series was well worth seeing. It's only three episodes but they are 90 minutes each (plus the original pilot which follows pretty close to the re-done version). I love that even the extras are captioned! I'm glad I got it in blu-ray, lots of good from the air scenes of London. It's the kind of series that I'll watch again and notice new details each time so well worth buying versus renting. I had a different solution for the first episode. I thought the killer was taking the antidote beforehand and all the pills were poison..."
3,Poor sound track,"The acting and story line are okay, however, the sound track was so poor that we could not enjoy the second episode."
5,"PERFECT, PERFECT, PERFECT, PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!","I watched the first episode of this amazing series online and from then on I was hooked. I have happily watched and re-watched the entire series from season one to the heartbreaking season 2 finale about A THOUSAND TIMES! I even managed to get my PARENTS hooked on the series. I'm biding my time till series 3 comes out in Fall 2013. Oh, hurry Steve Moffat. Hurry!"
2,Not for Cutting,"These are not ""cutting"" mats. OK for putting washed produce on and chopping or light cutting like onions or eggs but don't even think about cutting meat on them. One use and they are so badly scratched that they are not food safe anymore."
2,KEEP CONTANIMATION OFF YOUR KITCHEN TITLE,THESE ARE OK. I WISH THEY WERE A LITTLE HEAVIER. NOW TO GET EVERYONE TO USE THEM.
2,not as good as touted,"I agree with many of the reviewers in that these warp, bend & curl too easiy. And I didn't even stick them in the dishwasher. They look and behave like an ordinary plastic sheet. I don't like that they slide all over the place when in use. And I also don't like that they don't bend easily to 'funnel'/transfer your chopped up bits into a pot/plate/etc. One star for the relatively reasonable price and another for easy storage."
3,Need some extra back-up.,The colored-coded system of these boards is great but the boards themselves are on the flimsy side. We found it necessary to put a wooden cutting board underneath these so as not to make marks on the counter below. They do well in the washing machine but the heat has warped them a little.
2,Moy really what I expected,"I know that they were cheap, but these cutting boards are REALLY thin. They are so thin that I don't even want to use them. They look like notebook dividers rather than cutting boards!"
2,cracked,"I was very disappointed that the green one cracked the first time I used it. Haven't tried the others yet, hopefully they won't all crack."
3,"Ehh, It's 10 bucs. Good for camping.","Great portability and low cost. For 10 bucks these work OK. They work perfect for fruit and veggies. They do have a curling problem and slide around when cutting large things such as chicken or roasts. They are also a little small. If you carve whole chickens into pieces you will not like these very much. I'll stick to my large, heavy wood board for large items.They do work great for camping. I'd get them again for that reason alone. Space in a camping box is always a premium and these fit the bill!"
2,Disappointed,"I used to have IKEA's flexible cutting boards. After dropping both I owned in an inaccessible space between the fridge and the counter, I ordered these from Amazon. They're no good. They're flimsy, and their surface is very plasticky. The IKEA boards, on the other hand, are thicker/sturdier, while still being very flexible, and they have a surface that just feels better to cut on. I used these for a couple of months, then I got the opportunity to buy an additional set of IKEA boards, so I shall use these no more."
1,No Delivery,"I ordered a set of these in early May. I was told they were in stock and would ship in 8 to 10 days. Well, first of June comes and I have not received notice that they have shipped, so I check and find an estimated delivery date of OCTOBER now..... who knows if I will ever get them!"
1,Ooh Dear Seth - what happened?,"Ooh Dear Seth - what happened?This book is an extension of purple cow, perhaps the bits he failed to add. Plain and simple it is anecdotal at best with no facts to back up his assertions and at worst it is simply another way of financing his vacations to Europe.Seth's recent books are rapidly shrinking in size with less and less to say, if you are a Seth Fan (I used to be until he started churning out half-baked books without substance) pick up a second hand copy. Seth talks about holding off marketing slight improvements and waiting until a substantial customer driven Free prize emerges. Well Seth take some of your own medicine and bring us a new book with pages, content and a few facts to back up your ideas.Disappointing..."
4,Get the book and get an edge...,"Godin scores another marketing masterpiece. In Free Prize Inside he gives solid examples to support his theories and ideas. Find out what edgecraft is and how it can help you succeed!Once you buy the book, visit the site (http://www.freeprizeinside.com) for some helpful and amusing thoughts on powerpoint."
3,Disappointed in this Krups product,"You have to toast bread on both sides to get decent toast.The unit does not have a ""cool top"" and gets too hot to touch. On the positive side, it has plenty of internal space and broils/bakes very well."
3,Just an okay mirror,"The mirror is too small to see the back of my head while fixing my hair. The acrylic mirror doesn't give a good image. I gave it a 3 star because it was a great idea, just not feasible for me to use."
3,Night time Remifemin,Will you ever carry the night time Remifemin. I use both the regular one and Nighttime and would like to get them both from the same place
3,Perhaps it is good --- for others,"Dry eyes hurt, pain in nasal passage, on 1/2 dose - Bad for me... Tossed it as I do not want another fight with B Cohass sellsmen - Hot flash continues... I should be strong and fight but I am just so worm out...K"
1,Doesn't Work For Me,"I tried this product for over two months and saw no reduction in hot flashes. What I found helps somewhat is taking Evening Primrose Oil capsules 3 times daily, along with a separate Black Cohosh supplements. Combined, those supplements cost about half as much as Remifemin and provide a good amount of relief from hot flashes. They are less frequent, less intense, shorter in duration and they don't wake me up at night anymore. If one supplement doesn't help you, try something else - everyone's body is different in how it responds to supplements."
4,Worked for a while,"Remifemin worked very well for about 4 months, then the symptoms came back, despite upping the dosage to 3x day. I'm now on a different supplement. In a year or so, I will try it again."
4,A Fabulous Flurry of Fantastic House,"White Party USA is definitely an excellent compilation for the gay genre. Sixteen full length remixes on 2 discs gives the listener plenty of music to listen to on their way to Pride or their local night club. The downside of this 2 disc set is that it isn't actually mixed together. There are breaks in between the songs (where one ends and the other begins) making it hard to listen to non-stop. Also, while it definitely captures a variety of the gay music scene in 2002, it does not cover some of the more popular tunes most of us were listening to at the various clubs and house parties at the time. Dispite both of these little quirks, WPUSA is definitely a compilation to add to your ""gay house"" collection."
5,A record to adore.,"This is absolutely a record to love. Even though the regular bassist-gone-solo is not usually a fortunate news to hear, but Melissa Auf der Maur is an exception. She will stun you with her surprisingly powerful and magnetic voice, delievering beautiful, strong, and catchy rock tunes with a touch of edge, along with her unique and wistful lyrics. It's probably too hard a task to pick out a song you don't like. Though you might need to take longer time with several songs that you don't get attached to immediately.In conclusion, this is definitely one of the best CDs so far, and nobody should miss this bassist out, for Auf der Maur is so much more than just that.Note : She sounds nothing like Courtney Love."
3,Hurt by aggressive mastering,"There's a lot of really good songs on this CD, but at times they can be hard to listen to because of aggressive mastering to make it ""loud"". As a result, on most of the tracks you can hear the ""pumping"" of the cymbals fading in and out as they are compressed by the other instruments coming in and out of the mix. It really bugs me on two of my favorite tracks, ""I'll Be Anything You Want"" and ""Would If I Could.""Other than being annoying to listen to at times, it's really a decent collection of tunes. Lots of interesting intricacies in the songwriting. Melissa, next time let the recording breathe a little. We can use the volume knob if we want it louder."
1,Style but little substance.,"I wanted to like it. I play bass and love solo bass records. But this isn't a serious bass effort at all. It's buried and you can't hear it. She uses a pick! She just wants to play guitar. The songs are trashy and childish. High school goth girls might like this between their razor blades and Cure collection. If you haven't outgrown goth/ lite metal, then this is for you. The lyrics are embarrassing, the playing is simple, and the songs are very repetitive. I give it an extra star for the poppy hooks of ""Real A Lie"" and ""Would if I Could""... well the first minute or so until they repeat. Too bad, because Mel is beautiful and has great style. Guess you can't have it all."
2,disappointed with this product,"the book has almost no problem sets for students to work on, and it has only little material to teach pre-algebra and algebra ( the title). I had to return it promptly after browsing through the book."
1,Forget it !,"This book not only is worthless but actually it is risky ,to say the least;if you follow the recommendations of the author.It reminds me of that famous book in the 80's ""No Money Down"",that made people (naive people) believe that not only could you buy real state with no money down and no credit ,but that actually you could walk away with money in your pocket!!!Anyhow,I read at least 1 or 2 books a month on investment as well as on retirement;this book only enphasizes that you have to get a financial planner to ""survive"" ;obviously, the guy is a CPA himself,other than that,it is plain rubbish.There are tons of better and more informative books out there."
4,Important information for people who plan for disasters,"John Barry presents an interesting history of the development of medical care in the U.S. He goes on to tell the story of the 1918 pandemic in graphic and compelling detail. Although it becomes rather ponderous by the end, there is a lesson to be learned. Governments and individuals need to be prepared to weather the storm of massive illness and deaths, as well as interruption of all government, business, medical and social services."
2,Names and Dates,"I tried to get interested in this book, because a friend had praised it to the skies. But it never engaged me--in fact, it was deadly dull, despite the fascinating subject--because instead of following a protagonist we could care about, it simply went from one crisis with one set of characters to the next. I never cared about the people involved."
3,A Flawed Masterpiece,"I gave this book an average three stars because that's an average of how this book progresses.It starts off very slowly with a description of the state of the medical art in the early 1900s , and biographies of the chief players involved in fighting the flu.All is this is very slow reading, although the author's description of how the flu virus functions is fascinating.But when the flu takes off, so does the book, and by the time I reached the end it was a page-turner, and I couldn't put it down. I was especially intrigued by the idea that the Spanish Flu set the stage for World War II.If you can make it through the first half of the book, it is a fascinating history of the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic."
4,Informative,This book was very informative. Did tend to jump around a bit with each scientist he followed in terms of timeline but overall it was an eye opening book. The best part about it was the new afterword he added to it. The afterword was a great way to appropriately finish his book.
2,Every writer needs an editor,"I'm amazed that such an overwritten book as this found a reputable publisher, let alone received such good reviews. If it had an editor, he or she wisely decided to remain anonymous. I had been looking forward to reading this, but 400 pages in I had to stop and see if others had the same problems with it that I did. Although I rarely quit on a book, if Barry uses the phrase ""influenza, only influenza"" one more time, I'm outta here.The book is repetitive, poorly organized and too long by half. The writing is choppy. Short sentences are wonderful. Moderation is wonderful. Short sentences are wonderful in moderation. As another reviewer observed, this is a good rough draft. What it sorely wants is editing, only editing. Such a fascinating subject, such a disappointing treatment. Guess I'll take the 1927 flood book out of my shopping cart."
3,Shorter would have been better.,If you are interested in a history of medicine you might enjoy this book. If you want a history of the flu pandemic of 1918 the book could have been one-half its length and been a better book. There is a lot of interesting information about the pandemic and the flu virus but I found many parts of the book boring and skipped a lot of it.
4,The Great influenza Epidemic,"This book was chosen for my AAUW book group, and I'm glad it was. I probably would never have chosen the book myself or even have known about it. It is fascinating. It is a thorough analysis of the beginnings of the 1918 flu pandemic (probably started here at a Kansas army camp as we were preparing to send troups to France#. I'd always heard it was the Spanish flu #nonsense#, killed 20 million people #probably closer to 80-100 million)and little was done to stop it (all- out effort from the american scientists of the day)and how the pandemic influenced history (Wilson had the flu during negotiations on the Treaty of Versailles) With the emergence of H1N1, everybody should take a page out of history and read The Great Influenza."
2,Poorly written,"The story of the Great Influenza is, itself, quite gripping -- a country coming out of the horrors of war confronts a plague on a scale not seen in the U.S. before. However, the author's writing leaves a lot to be desired -- as another reviewer notes, there is lots of repetition, but there are also plenty of instances of just plain bad writing (I seem to recall a sentence that was something along the lines of ""Whatever their death was, it killed them.""). If you are really interested in the story, it's worth wading through, but if you are the sort of reader who is put off by poor sentence structure and choppy narrative, you'll want to find a different book to read."
3,Interesting,"It is interesting. However, the author belittles the Public Health Service labs as wasting time investigating Bayer asprin as a possible agent of germ warfare. This was a very real possiblity and not hysterical fear-mongering. Bayer chemists were the inventors of chlorine gas. In fact, during WWII Bayer (as part of IG Farben) supplied Mengele with drugs to test on concentration victims!More people should have listed to the PHS."
3,"Interesting book, but goes very slowly in parts","This book a a very detailed history of the influenza pandemic of 1918 (a part of history not often discussed or that well known). It is very interesting because of that, but is not very well structured or organized. The story doesn't really have a focus. The author tries to cover too much territory. It would have been better if he had narrowed the focus a bit and concentrated more on a particular aspect of the pandemic. The book tends to wander a bit and is often very repetative. He often uses upward of 10 or so examples to make a point when one or two would do. You find yourself cruising past certain pages to get back to the more core part of the story. Good history, interesting information, facts and characters, but a slow, winding read."
2,Where was the editor?,"Tangents, repetition, convolution.Barry crams a lot of facts in the 465 pages, but organizes the story poorly with constant repetition, odd leaps of time and place, and melodramatic language.Where was the editor who should have helped organize the story and cull the repetitions?Barry describes a medical community tipping a balance from ""art"" to ""science"" at the end of the 19th century, and yet frequently describes the influenza virus as though it had a will: ""Nature chose to rage in 1918, and it chose the form of the influenza virus with which to do it.... It came in a masquerade. Then it pulled down its mask and showed its fleshless bone.""Nature does not have a volition, viruses simply ""are.""Barry should have trusted inherent drama of the facts and simply told the story.Cut 100 pages of tangents and repetitions and the reader would be left stunned by the events, not reaching for caffeine."
5,hole in one,"slack is no slacker when it comes to writing about golf.....watching the americans come back at the ryder cup may have been more exciting, but nowhere near as entertaining as slack's masterpiece. i truly believe there is a medal waiting for him in stockholm thanks to his words in this book.. thelast book i read that came close in terms of sheer insight, humor and wit was james solomon's real world book of a couple of years ago. this should be mandatory reading for anyone who plays golf, knows someone who plays golf, or knows someone whose father once knew a guy whose buddy played golf. a must read."
1,Bad Game....,"....The graphics are good, but that is about it. There is no point in even playing this game against the computer because none of your commands are ever followed anyway. ....I wasted numerous hours hoping that game play would improve, but it never did. The Command and Conquer series, Warcraft, or similar strategy games are 10 times better!"
5,Extremely realistic and exciting!,"It is an amazing adventure. It is one of the best games I've ever played. It's extremely addictive and awesome! I think it is one of the best games on earth. If you are interested in battling games, this is definitely the game for you. I also think the graphics and the realism is amazing. Great for people who love history and battles. ~ SnowEater11 from Weymouth Ma"
5,Great Info,"The book is slightly dated, but all in all it provides primo information. Lots of useful ideas and ways to accomplish goals for a victory in the endgame. Well worth the purchase in my opinion."
3,Not a Groundbreaking Encyclical,"An overview of the devotion to the Sacred Heart - with a full history and theological discussion in this encyclical by Pius XII. As in most encyclicals of this type, Pius XII expounds on the theological and scriptural basis for the traditional devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus - culminating in the discussion and acceptance of the revelation to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque."
1,Not stable,"When I received the stroller, I was terribly disappointed. It looked nothing like the stroller on the picture. The fabric was very rough and the color was awful. The stroller was very wobbly and unstable. I actually returned the stroller because it was a big disappointment!"
2,Its okay.. but not all that,"It is an okay stroller. Though it is not as firm as a peg perego. What I liked about it was its weight, its a light stroller. However Im trying to get rid of it because it takes up a lot of space in my car, it gets stuck, and it is a pain to convert from pram to forward facing. All in all I would not recomend it. Spend the extra money on a peg perego!"
3,Overall great but.......,The movie was fairly good overall but the ending tanks I mean seriously if they had just waited 5 - 10 minutes. I give the ending a -5 but threst was ok I'll give it a 3.
4,Scary - followed the novella very closely,Very scary. Glad I didn't see this in the theatre - I had to pause it 4 or 5 times. The ending was horrifying!
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"""The Mist"" has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Thank goodness we didn't pay to go see it in the theaters. My teenagers found the ending disturbing and we were horrified. How a father shooting his own son and then getting rescued is a ""fantastic plot twist"" is beyond any scope of my imagination. Isn't there enough crud in the world without putting out trash like this?"
2,TOO LONG - CRAPPY ENDING,Could have been so much better. The reason for the Mist is not fleshed out enough and was actually the most interesting part! Could have gone in so many better directions. More of a hopped-up TV movie than a theatrical release. Disappointing.
4,Best of Stephen King's,"Great study of human nature under pressure !!!Although there are some cliches alluding to ""Aliens"", this is probably King's best - along with Lawnmower Man(which was good only for its VR premise & effects)!!!"
2,Left me depressed...,"The ending of this movie is so horrible and disappointing. I just finished watching this movie and I'm actually depressed!! I've read other reviews and some say the ending is to be expected because this is a horror film, but jeez!! I want a HORROR film to leave me scared and afraid to turn the lights off, not sad and depressed!!! I just can't believe the ending...I was so excited to see this movie and now I wish I would have watched it up to the ending and than turned it off, because up to the end it was a pretty decent movie. They totally ruined Stephen King's book! In my opinion anyway...."
4,"Good Movie, Brutal Ending","After hearing bad reviews from friends I decided I better watch this movie, since I usually like what they dislike, it's a Sci-Fi thing. I was pleased with the entire movie, the suspence was good and the special effects were adequate. Although I won't give it away, the ending was brutal. Some people might find it ironic, it just made me feel like crap."
3,Close but No Cigar,"I bought the movie last Friday and I was going to rate it five stars until the ending. The ending was very disappointing and not the ending I read in the book nor heard in the audio adaptation of the novella. If it had stayed truer to the storyline, I would have rated it higher. It's a shame. The graphics and moodiness of the movie were excellent."
1,Why can't there be less than one star?,"Despite cool visualization for the creatures, this has to be the worst movie that I have ever seen. One could try to say that this was a story of ""what would you do in a situation like this?"", but that explaination is hardly plausable. No character reacted smartly or realistcally, even Thomas Jane's character is not excused. Also, I am really tired of Hollywood portraying belief in God as something meant for extremists and radical zealots. I'm also no fan of twisting the Bible to fit the storyline. The characters and dialogue moved at a snail's pace. Two hours was way too long to sit through a movie with an ending like that. The omninous ""MIST"" dissapates in seconds? The giant creatures taken down so simply? It all just doesn't add up. Either the screen writer changed some things or Stephen King has definitely lost something. As you can guess...I will never recommend this movie to anyone."
1,ABANDON SUPERMARKET,"This film vaguely reminded me of the 1957 production ""Abandon Ship"" with Tyrone Power. Totally different locale and genre, but still a character study of people in distress.The irony is that the ending was changed from the original story by Stephen King.Not good.You don't put the audience through 2 hours of suspense and end it all with pure drek. Unless, of course, you wish to emulate a Hitchcockian twist which in this case is severely lacking in style and format.Sir Alfred had a knack of dividing the good guys and the bad guyswith ""just dues"" set accordingly.Sorry, this is a waste of time."
1,Poor quality,I thought that it was in HD and boy was I disappointed. I really liked this movie so I gave amazon a chance but I see it won't happen again.
5,Stephen King doese it again,i can not say i have seen one bad Stephen King movie. the mist is creepy and exciting at the same time. this movie is really good. it's a must see.
4,Lighten up haters...,...Stephen King in the hands of Frank Darabont will always be above par and this is no exception. And what continues to always be perfect with Darabont's interpretations is the supporting cast...his crew of regulars that have shown up again for a King adaptation. Jeffrey DeMunn is again excellent as Dan Miller as is William Sadler and Brian Libby with a minor part and not half bad...jk. Marcia Gay Harden is great as the righteous tounge wagger and when it finally stops wagging it's a stand up and cheer moment. Kudos again Mr. Darabont...keep 'em comin'. If you didn't like the ending too bad. The book didn't have one so Frank made one. Not for everyone I'm sure...but it was shocking and not for shock value sake either. But rather good entertainment shocking...More like 3 1/2 stars so will rate it 4
5,Excellent adaptation from the Novel by Stephen King,"I won't get into too many details here, the adaptation is good and I was pleased with the film in total. It is very claustrophobic ala ""Night of the Living Dead"" replacing the farm house by a supermarket, full on glass in the front. Mist manages the suspense and the tension that increases to final climax at the end. I really recommend Mist for all completists of good SCI-FI genre and Stephen King adaptations. Acting is superb and visual effects are decent. The plot is what keeps you there wanting for more, and the final twist is unexpected. Go buy it and own it now."
2,The Outer Limits would of disowned this....,"I like Frank Darabont. His ability to interpret Stephen King for the screen has always pleased me. The Mist unfortunately failed to impress. A promising beginning and gripping middle are sullied by an ending the Outer limits tv show would be embarrassed to put it's name too. Ok, ok people go to movies for different experiences. But I'm sure I can't be the only one who despises films that at the last moment attempt to trip you up, to throw you on you face and then laugh ""ha what you going to do about it?""If ever a film could of done with an alternative ending for the dvd release it's this one. I like to be rewarded for making the effort to watch a movie, I'm not saying I always want a happy ending, or a positive out come. I just don't want to leave the cinema feeling like I've been robbed of my humanity.If you haven't seen the Mist I would urge you to rent it rather than own it. I don't think your going to want to watch this more than once."
2,"Be warned, it won't leave you with the warm fuzzies","I saw the previews, I read the reviews, I rented it on DVD. I was not prepared for the ending. The ending is insanely depressing, it breaks the rules of normal movie etiquette, in the most disheartening way. I won't give up the ending, but after an hour and a half of enjoying a scary movie, it turned into almost a psychological ""thriller"" that left me needing a walk on a sunny day. Unfortunately it was 10 pm and I went to bed with a pit in my stomach. Now you're warned!BTW if you'd like to warn me about other good movies that will leave me heartbroken in a bad way, go ahead.Thanks"
2,never screw with a good thing !,"I waited for years to see this made into a film , and had high hopes for it . but some idiot thought he knew better than the author of the story how it should end ! and by changing the ending totally ruined it ! why would you produce a rather decent film from a great story ,and then rip the very heart and soul from it ? this fool should never be allowed to produce another film !"
1,The WORST SK movie EVER!,"I am a HUGE SK fan and was sooooo excited to see this movie, since we missed it in the theater...SAVE YOUR MONEY!This is the absolute WORST movie made based on a SK work EVER!King always gives us characters that we are drawn in to love and care about and breaks our hearts when something evil happens to them. There are NO characters to care about in this movie. It is gore, gore, gore galore...no moving plot...just a mishmash thrown together. It is deplorable...I just can't stand to think this movie even exists based on a SK work...even in the worst movies made based on his work, the acting is good and the characters shine through...NOT HERE FOLKS!The ending doesn't help either...such a waste...I only put one star because it is required for this review...I give it minus 10 stars actually!"
2,The worst movie I've seen lately,"I don't understand why people rate this movie so high. The story itself is weak, direction is plain terrible (with long cutscenes with poor and naive dialogue), CG effects very outdated. There are several occasions where I just could not believe that such poor scenes can still exist in a feature movie, not some cheap TV series (like the one in the beginning when nobody believes the central character about the first encounter with the tentacles - it just looks so artificial).And the ending - well - it just made me laugh at how stupid the film is."
1,A Stench from the Mist,"If you have a Christian faith, this movie will offend you. If you have any literary knowledge of the Bible, this movie will offend you. If you have any common sense, you will find the ending of this movie to be just plain stupid.The writer of the screenplay takes a random hit at the Book of Revelations and the old testament, taking every biblical comment out of context and making a noticeable effort to belittle people of faith. More and more of the liberal architechs of Gollywood are putting political and religious commentary into their films. They are doing a grand job of alienating much of their audience -- the people who spend money on their products.This movie could have been really good without of the religious hysteria and the addition of a hero with common sense.Save your money."
1,Absolutely stupid,"This was the stupidest movie I have ever seen. Marginal acting, typical cartoon CGI effects, but the writing is the worst of all. You go through anxiety and torture for 2 hours, only to end in pointless unbelievable nonsense (presented in a pretentious artsy manner). Don't waste your time on this film."
1,Regurgitated King,"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out...and I had a hard time not walking out in the middle of it.For years I have endured Mr. King's seemingly obligatory snipes at Christians; but it seems that here he gives full vent to his bigotry, and as a result produced a thing far beneath its potential for the sake of his malicious rant.I own many of Mr. King's works, and was able to enjoy them despite the ever-present wacky Christian character each one has; but Mr. King seems to have gotten so lost in his anti-Christian scripting that the rest of the story got lost.Wake-up Mr. King, the world needs more story-tellers and fewer bigots. You've got the talent, now just stop abusing it."
4,good set,set is nice. outside is aluminum which doesnt look as good as stainless steel but seems to be a great set.
1,A Laughably Bad Book Written by a Failed Neocon,"Laurence Jarvik is that rare creature, a failed neo-con living in a neo-con city under a right wing president. While every half-wit right winger has managed to get a job in the administration or at least a TV spot as a pundit, all he has managed to achieve is a book attacking such evils as Big Bird and Masterpiece Theater. PBS is pompous, boring and corporate but to dismiss it as an evil outpost of left wing propaganda is just ignorant and laughable. Jarvik knows nothing about the media having never worked in it and knows nothing about writing -- he appears to be almost functionally illiterate. Jarvik is a failure as an academic, a failure as a writer, a failure as a thinker and a failure as a critic. This has to be one of the dullest, most pointless books ever written."
1,Worthless product,"This game takes place in Russia and was written by Russians that have no idea how to write a game. Actually, this is just a sorry excuse for a game. The game is fundamentally flawed-EVEN after it gets patched. And the patches will keep coming. Don't waste your money. I would have rated this a negative 4 stars, if I could have."
3,Slowww.,"The Good.1. The premise was pretty good.2. Enemy AI is ok, but not as good as Halflife 2 or Farcry.3. The Hungry/Bleeding/Tired thing was pretty innovative.The Bad.1. Very difficult.2. Processer Hog even with setting turned down.3. Load times take forever.Overall, worth a buy from the bargain bin."
1,Wont Play on PC,"I bought this game because of the high rating on Gamestop. When I got the game and loaded it everything was OK. When I tried to start a new game it quit running and a bug found window popped up and asked to send a bug report to the game maker. I sent the report twice and got a mailer daemon for undeliverable address. Some support!! There is another selection to play online which I did try and it ran fine and took me to a site for team type play. I do not play games of this type on the internet as my reflexes are not as fast as a twelve year olds anymore and there is too much cheating. I have since Googled the game and found that quite a few people have the same issue, it won't run. Some have got it to run with very techy work arounds but I am not that tech savy. I contacted the company via there website but have not received a reply.I guess it is buyer beware on this game, too bad because it looked like a good fps."
2,Full of tech bugs,"I am not new to pc gaming and I always figure there will be an couple of hours of problems and patches like a lot of games have. I've always been able to work through them in the past with other games. The problem with STALKER is that when it crashes you have to unplug your machine, or at least I did. After at least 6 hours trying to make the game run for more than 10 minutes without crashing, I gave up. I just don't have any more time to waste on it. I won't send it back to Amazon I'll just eat it. The little I was able to play looked like a fun game that I wish I could play. But until they come out with another patch or something, it simply is unplayable. Of course this is just one case. Your experience may very."
4,close to great,"I think people is been too hard with this game, i found it pretty good, even when my machine is not the best for the game, it is realistic (well, you know what i mean) and who wants a game when anyone can defeat you. four stars because could be better."
1,Too many bugs!!,"If you buy this game, you're gonna need a can of Raid to get rid of all the Bugs! . Wait another 6 months to a year from now when THQ finally gets around to developing a decent patch for this game. Save your money for now. Buy this game at your own risk!"
2,lame RPG posing as an FPS,"Walk around. Die of radiation. Walk around. Die of radiation.This game is too complicated (like Bioshock) to be enjoyable. Game makers should take cues from Half-Life, Crysis and COD 4 which are exciting but you don't have to read the manual over and over and over and still not figure it out.This game sucks."
2,Just O.K.,"I was disappointed in the game engine, but it's still ok for people who aren't used to better games like Battlefield 2 or Half-Life 2"
3,Nice knives with a few issues,"My biggest complaint with the set is that the box mine came in, while very nice, and well constructed, was not made for the knives in my set. The indentions are for straight handled knives, and are the wrong size for the knives that are included in the set.Also, on one of my knives the piece on the very end ofthe handle is not flush, it feels as if it was not constructed properly."
4,Wonderful spiritual insights for children,"I am a Christian elementary school teacher. I used this book for my daily Easter devotions. The details went far beyond the ""usual"" Easter stories. They were factual,in depth and challenging spiritually. My class begged me to read more each day. My rating was a little lower because the price was a little higher than I expected. I recommend this book for anyone who wants their child to truly understand Christ's Journey to the Cross."
4,"NBA Live 2000 Good, But Could Be Better","It is easily the best basketball game out there on the markewt today for computer. But it isn't perfect. I love the dynasty mode, but some aspects of the game are very unrealistic. Overall a solid game, but I'd wait for 2001."
1,disappointing service,"I may have a lemon but I've had nothing but trouble with it. And the really disappointing thing is that the service at Apple is awful. you can't talk to anyone, you have to sign on and do it online - they won't let you write much, I had to redo it 3x to get it to take. and I sent it once and they didn't fix it. now I'm sending it again and they are charging me for shipping. I'll never buy another Apple product and if it doesn't work this time I'm moving on to another MP3. too bad - its cool and it sounds good when it works."
5,Best MP3 Player out there,"I received my 10 GB iPod in May of this year, and I love the little thing. I have over 1100 songs on my iPod, but there is still plenty of room for growth.What I love about the iPod is the ease of use. I can easily find a song in a matter of seconds.The iPod has set the standard for all MP3 players, and in my opinion is probably the easiest to use, and best looking."
5,A true GEM!,"The ipod is what Sony could only wish for in now lost dreams. I'm blown away with my ipod, it was so easy to firure out I was downloading in about 5 mins. My Sony Minidisc is now sitting in a box, its slow, cumbersome and ugly compaired to the ipod. By the way does any one know of the very POOR Windows software (OpenMG Jutebox) that Sony supplies with the latest Minidisc? It offers nothing for the Mac user but caused so much trouble running on Windows that most gave up on it anyway. Its no wonder Window users are upset with the poor software offered across the board. I do see some happy Window users so it must be workable but know iTunes makes it shine for me. I can only offer my views as a Mac user, you'll love it! As far as the battery goes a new case will be needed if the battery fails, but the seamless case won out. You do NOT thorw your ipod away if the battery fails as some have said in the reviews."
1,quality problems galore,"The ipod I got had a rattle on it. If a piece of technology this price makes noises when shaken the day it was bought, I don't want to know what it'd do with time and some work-outs....So be warned: you may get a noisy ipod, and be told by apple that that's the way life is."
4,10GB iPod,"This is pretty expensive for an MP3 player, but its worth it! It is small and attractive in design. It's also pretty easy to use - I've had little trouble with mine. I have a PC with Windows XP, so far, so good! The one issue is that it comes with a firewire port, while most PCs these days use USB ports. You can get a converter for like $20, but that part is kind of annoying.It holds a decent amount of songs, 10 GB is quite a lot! I don't even have mine close to 1/4 full! It works well, though I invested in a better pair of headphones because the ones it comes with are kinda crappy! Overall - I think it is overpriced, but it is attractively built, holds lots of songs, is easy to use and works well!"
1,You might wanna skip this!!,"Ok I'm conviced that some of the people who wrote reviews for this work for Macintosh. I was really looking forward to getting one for my birthday. Instead of having it work flawlessly (yeah I know. I guess my expectations were high. This is a MAC product we're talking about here) it froze in diskmode for an hour. That wasn't all that big deal since I was able to figure that problem out. Soon after though, the battery keep indictated that it was out of power. This after it had been CHARGING FOR 4 HOURS AND SAID THAT BATTERY WAS FULLY CHARGED!! The best was yet to come though!!! You need to install musicmatch jukebox in order to transfer music to your iPod. Well it froze each time I tried to transport mp3s to the iPod. The last time it froze it deleted almost ALL of my MP3s!!!! That was it for me so now it's going back to the store tomorrow so I can get my money back. Way to go Mac!!!!"
1,Joke,"Nothing like the original and full of stupid stuff, a slave writing with a ball-point pen dressed in a leather jacket, please!!"
2,"Boring plot, bad writing","I can't believe Peter David wrote this book. The writing is so far below his usual standard that I am at a loss. My other problem with the book is that the characters of NF are hardly in the book at all. The new character of Xyon was somewhat interesting, but not enough to sustain this cliched story."
4,Brotherly Love,"Si Cwan is doing his job of joining the planets of the fallen Thallonian empire when he finds a hint to the whereabouts of his sister, Kalinda. He goes in search of her with Xyon (who has a thing for Kalinda). The book has a lot about Si Cwan and Xyon but not much more about anyone else."
4,I Couldn't Put It Down,"I enjoyed The Quiet Place immensely. I couldn't put it down, it was so good. Even though the Excalibur and its crew were not very involved in the story, I loved it. Peter David did a fantastic job with this book. I loved reading about the Dogs of War, and found Riella's story fascinating. If you're looking for a great read, this is it."
2,Dull and boring,"This book seems almost a stereotype of Star Trek rather than a book seeking new worlds. I found it dull and boring -- although I finished reading it and, therefore, can not in fairness give it only 1 star. The descriptions of the different alien races were almost non-existent, as if the author automatically assumed that the reader knows what a Montosian, for example, looks like. Having picked this book up cold, without reading anything that came before, I was not impressed. Please, as an author, remember that your readers may not begin a series in the beginning!"
3,Wasn't someone pregnent at the end of #6?,"I have to admitt that the Star Trek book are a guilty pleasure. They are to real science fiction what grocery store romances are to real literature, Cheap and easy fun. I think I have enjoyed the ""New Frontier"" books especially because they stand on their own and have never been on video. I also like the fact that they are maybe a little less spit and polish than the rest of statfleet.I do have one bone to pick with this book though. It's been a while since I read #6 but I thought Soleta found out she was pregnent at the end of #6. Now I know that Vulcans are supposed to be focused and logical, but shouldn't it have at least been alluded to in this book? It's not the sort of thing you can put a shelf until it fits into your schedule."
1,Screed,"Come on --- let's have some sanity. I thought American's were smarter than this. If most American's believe this, worry."
5,"Finally, Someone With Guts Who Says It Like It Is--And Clearly!","J.D. presents a well-documented, fact based expose on what is really going on with illegal immigration and its cost to our country. We all worry about the ""slippery slope"" we are on in many of the social issues of today, but for some reason, there is a large group of people, including our so-called lawmakers, who see nothing wrong with the lawbreaking going on in the area of illegal immigration. It's as if selective lawbreaking is OK, as long as you sympathize with the plight of the lawbreaker. Being from Arizona, I see first hand the environmental damage and ruination of our healthcare system because of illegal aliens. Starting out life in the U.S. as a law breaker is not the way to go, and law abiding citizens should be the first to protest. J.D. offers the only real solution: absolute enforcement--and tells us how to accomplish it!"
1,Cloyingly sweet scent,"I love the smell of lavender and bought this product based on the positive reviews here. So I was terribly disappointed to open the package and find a powder that smells nothing like lavender as I know it. I don't know how to describe what this smells like, but if you have ever purchased the wonderful lavender-scented products sold by Williams-Sonoma, IT SMELLS NOTHING LIKE THAT. It smells cloyingly sweet. I don't think your grandmother would like it either. She will smile and thank you politely, but once you leave, this will be something she packs away never to be used again. Trust me, I'm probably the same age as your grandmother and this stuff is headed for the trash."
3,By a student in Taiko...,"i've been taking taiko drumming for a while now, and this is my alternative to spending $1450 for a nagado taiko drum, and i have to say, this is an awesome game....that is all..."
3,Will the REAL Clive Cusler please write the next NUMA book!,"Cusler's books are memorable for the two action heros Dirk Pitt and Al Giordano but it is Cusler's crisp and compelling writing that keeps the reader turning the pages trying to read each new book in a single sitting. This latest pseudo-Cusler book is an enjoyable read, it's just not Cusler. Why give us the shadow when we can have the substance? The Kurt Austin/Jose Zavala characters don't really do anything, and what action there is, is flat and unimaginative. Yes, there is a tantalizing combination of mysteries to be solved and yes, there is an attempt to weave the series' regulars into the plot, but the book lacks the genius that characterizes the earlier books in which each new paragraph, sentence and word compelled the soul of the reader to gnash teeth, shiver in excitement or even shed a tear for the NUMA team. If Cusler is gone forever, then RIP Dirk and NUMA, the new team isn't getting the job done."
1,New super-hero = old superhero.,"We have a new super hero here. He walks, talks, acts, etc....just like his predecessor, Dirk. They must have been twins in some previous life. Cussler seems to have run out of interesting material. Better that he would introduce a new main character in the form of a woman than a rehash of his first one, Mr. Pitt. All this at the newer, higher paperback price. No thanks."
3,My First Cussler,"This was my first read of Clive Cussler. I enjoyed the twists and turns of the complicated story, but I did not feel as engaged about the characters. I was glad to read an adventure novel without a lot of swearing and sex, but that is just me. Now that I have read one Cussler, I plan to read more."
3,New 2-D characters replace the last ones,"The main discussion here is, of course, replacing Pitt/Giordino with the Austin/Zavala pair. By seeing just how thinly developed these new characters are it shows that Cussler really should develop some characters with a little depth - and I don't mean bring back Pitt, etc. The original characters were just as manufactured and thin, we'd just gotten used to them. The NUMA mileau Cussler created is excellent. It provides virtually endless schenarios and stories in which NUMA's people can be involved. Just provide some realistic characters to live in it. Leave the supermodel scientists, invulnerable heroes, and unrealistic combinations for television (I still grin when I remember how Cussler described Perlmutter in an earlier book as an eighty year old, 400 pound gourmet in excellent health. Couldn't we all be so lucky!)."
4,I inserted Dirk for kurt and Al for Joe. It works.,"This book was a long time coming and I found myself inserting Dirk for Kurt and Al for Joe. When Gamay and Dr.Chi had their little mishap, it could have been Dirk and Al. But all in all uit took you on a wild ride and I wasn't dissappointed."
2,Can't Wait for Atlantis Discovered,"I was fearing that the books that I enjoy the most for relaxation were over, but thank goodness I see that Cussler is bringing back Dirk in Atlantis Discovered. I can't wait until 12/6 !"
2,Dissapointing!,"Call me old fashion,but I was dissapointed in Clive Cusslers' leaving Dirk Pitt entirely out of his latest book. I am a Dirk Pitt Fan not a NUMA Fan. How succesful would LIVE AND LET DIE have been without James Bond? I hope Clive hasn't written our AMERICAN HERO off for good, because the new guy's kinda wimpy!"
2,Inspiration missing,"Having read all of Cussler's previous books I must say that his quality is sinking. The plot was too thin, things kept happening too fast to keep in a state of suspense, the bad guys were far too stupid and the hero (Austin) resembled James Bond. I hope Pitt comes back soon. Also I'd rather see Cussler writing his own books himself.I don't recommend this book to dedicated Cussler fans."
2,"Dirk Pitt, please come back",I have read every book Cussler has written. I have enjoyed Dirk and Al making 007 look like a sissy. This book was soft and the characters were better suited for a soap opera than a Clive Cussler novel.
2,Where is the REAL Clive Cussler??,"As excited as I was to find a new Clive Cussler novel, I was equally dissappointed in ""Serpent"". It was obvious to me that Mr. Cussler had little to do with the writing of this book. It seems he sold his name for profit. If you put your name on a novel as the author, you should be the one to write the book, not someone else. I have no problems with new characters, but I feel Mr. Cussler sold me out. If he was honest and up-front with what he was doing (not writing the book), I would have no problem. But a man has only got his name and to sell it for profit is unconscionable."
3,Useful info,A pretty good guide with a lot of useful information. However I thought the approach was a little superficial in spots.I'd have preferred some real world example to the generalities that were offered.
1,Rip off!,"My mother ordered this book for me for my birthday. I had told her I got a dutch oven to bring camping, and she thought it would be a nice gift. She recently visited and I let her see the book. She was very upset because the thing is more like a magazine. I estimate it's true value to be about $2.99, maybe $3.99. The free booklet I received with my dutch oven is higher quality than this ""book"".Buyer beware."
5,My super new phone,"This is a great phone. I reset the left and right button to be video camera and still photo. Reset the resolution to high for good pictures. Now use the infrared to downoad to the PC and email to your friends. I also reset the background image and downloaded tons of free games (regular and java) and more than 80 songs and set them as my ring tones. Added all those images as tags for my contacts. It does take me a while before I tracked down a transparent cover with clip ... and a crystal keypad ... You can also compose music, use your phone as a remote control (download that - free), to-do list, e-mail, etc."
4,fun phone,"Of course any color phone is going to have a short battery life. The same way that any color lap top has a shorter battery life, it uses more energy. I love my phone, people are generally suprised that it is a phone when they see it. You get used to dialing the numbers at a rapid pace just like any other phone. I got my phone straight from the provider i use for my cell phone, so i dont know about the amazon rebate, my phone cost me about 99 dollars. For basic functions and a few advanced ones its a great phone."
2,Krazy Keypad,"Nokia has been known for thinking outside the box and creating innovative designs. I think they may be going too far with the 3650. I owned the thing for one day and couldn't deal with the circular keypad. Maybe I'm just retarded, but my fingers are trained to dial using a traditional keypad and it just took too much effort to have to learn where the keys were on this phone. Another criticism is that this phone is too damned thick. If it weren't for these 2 things, I probably would have grown to like the phone, being a big fan of Nokia in general. I'm now using the Motorola T722i and like it a lot (even though I'm not a fan of the flip phone)."
3,Poor Quality from Nokia,"Well, the features are sure fine, but here's my negatives:[T-Mobile is the service provider]1. T-Mobile doesn't have a network that let's this phone (or others) auto-change time when you travel. So you need to update this yourself even though the phone let's you set it to auto adjust. Not bad, but poor service.2. Default ring tone is Get Your Freak On by Elektra's Missy Elliot. Great! But then they hype you to buy it for a buck anyway.3. More critical. I downloaded 5 ring tones and set them for 5 distince contacts. When each one calls I hear only the default ring tone. This feature doesn't work. Same with showing the picture, too."
5,Nokia 3650,"When I first decided to purchase this cell phone it was for it's style,I have never seen a phone anything like this in my life. I feel in love with it. Now that I have the phone and use it on a daily basis, I am even more in love with it. The menu's are so easy to understand, the screen and the color is just wonderful. For anyone looking to buy a new phone check this one out, I have a feeling you will be happy with it."
2,Cheap screen scratches easily,"I carried this phone in my pocket, with nothing else in the pocket, for one day and by the end of the day the screen was completely scratched and dulled. They are using a cheap material for the screen, and its large size makes it to easy to get scratched. I'm returning mine."
1,No Service,"Bought the Nokia T Mobile service and when I tried to use the phone I found that I had been sold a service that does not exist.We have no T Mobile service in Bloomington,IN.T Mobile has been terrible to work with.They are not refunding me for the phone or service as of yet.They are rude and uncooperative in trying to resolve this problem.So,beware!"
2,An entry-level phone not for a pro.,"At first Glance, the phone seems to have almost everything that you wanted. After a while you might realize that you got more than what you bargained for! For instance you might notice that it is really cumbersome to use the round shaped keypad. Than you may notice that the 3650 likes to turn it self off sometimes even when the key lock is active!Sometimes it just locks up and freezes, other times it auto dials your friends, it must be telepathic. Other than all of that, the blue tooth software runs like a charm. Oh and did I mention that even after you unplug the ear peace the phone still tells you that you are using your head set :-)"
3,Don't drop this fragile phone. UI and screen are beautiful..,"I just received this phone. It feels like something Barbie would use in her little red plastic Corvette. The Symbian UI is beautiful though and the camera is fun, but just please don't drop this baby (reminding self). It ain't no Motorola...I bought it for its Bluetooth so that I could try out wireless anywhere web surfing. I plan to use my NX-70, Expansys bought Bluetooth Memory stick, Nokia 3650, and the Netfront Web browser to access sites. Who knows if it'll work!One thing I've realized is Palmpilots are about to go bye bye because all that functionality is already present in the Nokia 3650. The only upside to a Palm is a larger screen. That's why I think the Tungsten T|3 is a real device. Palm knows you can't shoehorn a 320x480 screen onto a cell phone..."
5,Great Product once you get it set up...,"I love my Apple 15GB Ipod but it was very difficult to get it set-up at first on my Windows PC. Everyone is right when they say MusicMatch isn't very good. I tried MusicMatch first but I had too many problems. It would not recognize my Ipod and then I couldn't disconnect the Ipod. So, I went to Ephpod to get the software everyone had recommend on Amazon and please believe me when I say that Ephpod is so much easier to use to transfer files to the Ipod. Anyone can use Ephpod, it is that easy. I recently took my Ipod with me on my summer vacation. It was perfect on the plane and on the beach. It is so light and easy to carry around. Great Product!!! I would recommend this product to anyone who is tried of carrying around all your CDs with you."
1,Poor Audio Quality,The bass breaks up on some pieces of music when the Rock or R&B equalizer setting is selected. This happens independent of the volume level. I've experience this problem with the Apple supplied headphones as well as my Grado SR80s. A user definable equalizer might have helped but Apple does not include this feature with the iPod. I would not purchase this product if you plan to listen to music with a reasonable amount of bass.
1,How much patience do you have?,"I had high expectations for this device and they were not met at all. I purchased the 15 Gig version for Windows and it simply will not synch with my MusicMatch library. Oh, it will get some of my songs... and then stop....and then some more.... and then stop. But I bought this because it promised to carry my entire music library.Three calls to Apple support and one to Dell (my PC) later and the device still won't perform as advertised. Is it the driver? Is it the Firewire card? Is it the device? Is it the cable? Is it the software? I don't know and frankly I don't care anymore. All I know is that I've already spent too much time trying to make it work. It's going back to the store.Oh, and if anyone from Apple cares.... You really want me to switch to Apple for all my products? You're going to have to do better than this. Feel free to blame the PC... that'll just [anger me] even more. Make it work or don't sell it, people. Is that too much to ask?"
3,Cute but not high quality,Adorable but very light weight and paint is fading fast.... Would definitely go ceramic or stone instead next time! Still it's cute for the price.
1,Arrived with base broken off,"When I opened the box, I discovered that the base had been broken off. It actually appeared that the styrofoam encasing the prodct was also broken right at the base, as though it were packaged that way. Aside from that, the product itself looked cheaply made and lightweight. Just junk. Back to Amazon it goes."
2,"Came broken on Bottom, pretty color","I ordered this, and hoped that even though many of the reviews said that the fire hydrant came broken in pieces, that mine wouldn't. Wrong. Bottom of hydrant was broken. Impossible to glue back together completely, but tried. Remains to be seen whether the dogs will use it, so far, I haven't seen them go near it. I really can't believe a company would send a product out knowing that it was broken like it was, really disappointing."
3,"Cute, but small","This is very cute and looks great in my yard. I was hoping for something a bit bigger, pretty small and short."
3,Amazon Packaging Is Terrible,"The produce was perfect, just as described. Unfortunately, the packaging was terrible and the piece arrived in pieces. If it weren't for a glue gun at home and the expertice to repair the product, it would have been returned. This is what I received from the seller:Very sorry to hear this, Ms A.... In this case, The hydrant was sent directly from Amazon's warehouse by their staff who prepared it for shipping... It did not involve Collectibles + Closeouts. Kindly call Amazon's Toll Free number at 866-216-1072 to properly report this bad experience... Thank you, Don Hein, Owner- Collectibles + Closeouts"
2,"Flat, Dull, Monotone, but Informative","The voice was annoying, flat and dull.The chants were transfixing, mesmerizing and other worldly.The information on the Dakinis is informative.If this were a CD of chants, I would have kept it, but it wasn't, so I didn't.Let someone else read for her and let her do the chants...an entire CD of them. I would buy that!"
4,Uniden DCT648-3 2.4 GHz Digital Expandable Cordless Phone with 3 Handsets and Digital Answering System,I am very satisfied with all the features.
1,terrible,I returned these phones due to their tinny quality and echo. They are also so small they are hard to hold without hands and the buttons are tiny.
4,Uniden cordless phone(s),"Even though we've only had these for one month, we are more than satisfied with all aspects of the purchase, from price to product. The telephone bases & head sets are attractive and unobtrusive. Additionally the headsets are easy to program and use. MY wife has a problem with using the telephone, then setting it down where ever the conversation ends, so having multiple headsets means fewer missed calls because we couldn't locate a phone!"
5,Add a WHISPER PUMP!,"I purchased this tubing for my 10 gal fish tank with a whisper air pump from here too. I will not have to buy another air pump for years to come. This is more than enough tubing for such a small tank. You could plug the pump in one room and run the hose to another it's so long! I'd say I'd buy more, but I have about 15 extra feet already and it's so durable I'm sure it's not going to have to buy more. Great one time purchase!Tetra 77851 Whisper Air Pump, 10-Gallon"
5,Terrific travel resorces,"Lonely Planet is the leading and best resource for any traveler, even if you're staying at top end places and want to live as a queen. Their detail, insights and advice have made every trip I've ever taken so much more valuable, and kept me ""culturally appropriate"". A top investment."
5,Great Invention,"Compared to coleman's price for the same product you can't beat it. I was very satisfied with the ease of use and amazingly it did just what I wanted it to...... work. It plugged right into the propane tank with ease and created a park like setting in my camp site. The lantern perched at the perfect height it was great. I even bought a hose to run my portable bbq with the lantern running at the same time with no problems. The people I went camping with were also pleased with many complements coming from them as well. Great product, save the money, buy the texsport."
3,Yes and No,"Yes it worked as intended for a little while. No it doesn't fool everybody, because it was stolen within 6 Mo's!"
4,SVAT ISC200,I purchased 3 of the ISC200 cameras and am impressed at how realistic looking they are. The camera itself is very sturdy and really looks real. The only problem was that when I took one of the cameras out of the box the plastic swivel that attaches to the arm was broken off rendering the camera useless. I can't understand why this was not made out of metal like the rest of the camera. Now I have to send it back and pay shipping both ways.
2,"bought it, played with it, but Im sending it back.","3 years ago I was willing to abandon my Mac and get a PC, which proved to be a much more powerful tool. Upon thinking about this, I questioned my allegiance to my palm V and ordered the HP 430se, lured especially by the MP3 player and color screen. What I got was a device that was bigger, much slower, a pain in the a** to navigate through, and the screen froze within minutes after taking it out of the box, and several times therafter. WinCE definately ain't there yet. I rather stick to my palm V and buy a separate mp3/voicerecorder, than deal with a slow, clumpy version of windows in my pocket.note: give msoft a year- Im sure they'll soon find a way to copy the palms speed and ease of use, while adding the advantage of seamless windows/wireless-internet connectivity."
4,Smooth transition if you are a current windows/outlook user,"The Windows CE and color monitor were the key reasons I purchased the Jornada. These features make it seem like a seemless conversion from the Windows based computer that I use everyday. The MP3 player has been a nice feature but keep in mind that downloading 1 song(appx 4.4 MB per song) is about all you can place on the hard drive. In order to have a true replacement for the RIO MP3 player, you will need to buy a storage card and they are not cheap. I purchased an additional 48 MB storage card and it was $199.00. This 48 MB will hold about 10 songs downloaded from the internet (4.4 MB x 10 songs = 44 MB). While the MP3 downloads were free, the $199.00 seems like an expensive way to create a 10 song collection (even if you can change it as many times as you want)."
1,Thought I'd love it...,"I really liked the design of this bluetooth set. I looked all over for it. I wanted a stereo headset that I could remove or drop one earpiece so that it wouldn't look like a stereo headset (for use at work.) I planned to listen to books on tape during boring meetings. :) But this headset was very uncomfortable after just a few hours and didn't transmit my voice well -- people complained that I was too loud and hollow sounding. Probably because the mike is on the ear piece, no boom. Anyway, I wish it could have worked better. No problem with returning it for a refund."
2,Not missing much,"This book is getting such great reviews - I'm confused. I was bored.Another reviewer mentioned she was ""brutally raped,"" it was not extreme. But quick & embarrassing. These feelings come up again when Bel & Hawk get intimate. Flashbacks! Then chemistry between the couple feels awkward. Blah. Most the book is just a lead up and come down around one good sex scene the author, or someone else, penned.There were moments I couldn't get past. Bel first sets eyes on him and she thinks along the lines of, it feels like I've known him f-o-r-e-v-er... cliche. And I couldn't believe the duel, (without giving anything away, haha); it's something so predictable you just guess it! And, the end? Say ""Cheese!"" I won't be reading any more of this series."
2,Not a story I would recommend...,"This story is certainly no fairy tale... if you like my taste in books, you won't like this one at allMaybe it was because Belinda was raped in the beginning of the story or maybe it was the fact that Hawk decided that he would marry another woman while keeping Belinda as his mistress-- the whole story just turned me off. Excellent story written, but I could not ignore that if a man had not protested and came forth with vital information regarding the murder mystery, Hawk would have went ahead with the sham marriage and Belinda would have married her childhood friend.I would have rated the story one and three quarters, but since the story is well written, it deserves a 2 star. The negatives are listed above."
1,A major disappointment,"This was my first Galen Foley, purchased based on the overwhelming number of 5 star ratings. This was also my last Galen Foley. I can only speculate that the other reviewers have never read Georgette Heyer, Amanda Quick or one of a number of other authors who write more engagingly, humorously and/or with more historical accuracy. The overall story line (poor girl forced into poverty, then 'prostitution'; man seeking to avenge the death of the women he loved) had significant possibilities, but the execution was flat. I skimmed the 2nd half, just to see how it ended."
1,"Rehash, Fluff, & Warm Fuzzies","This book is a rehash of material that has been presented in other books countless times. This would not be a problem if the author had a better presentation of the material or a new angle, but she actually has presented the material in an inferior way. She seems to be concentrating on creating warm fuzzies.The author could have stated everything that was needed in the first five pages and saved the reader the trouble of reading the other 242 pages. I guess the padding was presented to inspire the reader. Excuse me while I take a nap!"
5,AMAZING even if it's a tad fluffy,You must buy the book and start writing today! I was doing this way before buying this book and was freaked out to see what came to pass.Also the author does give credit to where it's due in this book.
1,These were disgusting,"We did not like these at all. The water was so thick, and it was too hard to get the noodles to cook properly. They wanted to stick together. If you have already purchased these, plan to eat right after cooking and try to use a much larger pot than you would expect. I've used the brown rice pasta before, and would recommend those instead."
2,White Rice Spaghetti,"I have to say first off that I love Tinkyada products. But I accidentally bought the white rice spaghetti instead of the brown rice spaghetti and I found a product I don't like from Tinkyada. My son (7) and I have Celiac's sprue and so eat gluten free everything. My son isn't usually picky about his gluten free food, but he won't eat the white rice noodles at all. I will eat them, but I definitely prefer the brown rice ones over these."
4,Fades to a very pretty baby pink,"This also makes a really nice pink when mixed with conditioner, but it's staying power is not great.Even without conditioner this one fades very fast, but it fades out to such a pretty pink that I don't even mind it.This dye has a very faint blue undertone to it which makes the faded pink really nice and pastel. (I used a hot pink shade, and it faded out as an orange/pink, I prefer this purple/pink fade much more)!"
1,unbelievably bad,i cant begin to describe how bad this movie is. not at all what you would think. gilbert godfried as the duck .. but not a duck just a grown man with a feather suit. this is horrible shlock dont waste your time
2,songs?,"I agree this cd needs a list. When I am looking for a particular song on karaoke, I check each cd, before I buys it. It helps to know what you are buying and i'm sure it would go over much better."
5,A good story is hard to find,"A good story is hard to find, one that you can sit down and read through, and then go back to re-read and re-read and re-read. Flannery O'Connor, however, wrote strong compelling fiction. And, in my opinion, her kind of stories are GREAT and how are hard to come by from other authors of our day and age.My favorite of the stories is her feature story, A GOOD MAN IS HARD TO FIND. This story is about a self-diluted grandmother living in a fantasy world that clashes with the cold hard reality of the escaped convict named The Misfit.Her stories have a keen eye for detail and a provide much more than what seems to be on the surface. Her short stories are definitely worth reading... and who knows, maybe you'll re-read and re-read."
3,Good value,"Compared to towels in my household (Ralph Lauren, Osli & Osli), this one isn't as thick and absorbent. [...] This would be ideal for guests.[...]"
4,Harry in Atlanta,"These towels are extremely thick as I told my wife, ""I could dry on one side and she could dry on the other and each of us would think we had a fresh dry towel."" They are so thick that it doesn't seem like they are absorbing much moisture. They do take a little longer to dry in the dryer."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I ordered this printer fabric to print digital stamps & color w/ copic markers. The markers bled way too much. I'll have to stick with what I was using before.It does, however work fine if you're printing colored photos for quilting.I was hoping to save money with this product, but sometimes you just have to pay a little more.This product is fine as long as you are not planning on using it with markers."
2,"Nina Simone is great, but this book needed more work","Nina Simone is a great artist with a compelling story to tell. Unfortunately, little of that story comes across in this book. Ms. Simone shares all sorts of details about her lovers, but very little about her music. There is almost nothing in the book about her recording sessions or why she sings particular songs the way she does. While Ms. Simone is very frank about her personal life, I would have liked to have learned more about her music. The book is also confusing because Ms. Simone will spend many pages on just a few days, and then entire years will be dismissed by a sentence or two. Ms. Simone's collaborator should have edited the book better and drawn out more music-related stories from her."
2,Underwhelmed,"These ear buds didn't fit my ears properly, so they didn't work very well. But my wife LOVES them. You need to be very careful about fit."
2,Cord management is the worst! Avoid!,"I bought these thinking the Sony quality would be there. The sound is reasonable but not near the quality of my Shure E-3s. The noise cancelling works minimally but the worst feature is the cord management. If these are placed anywhere, the cord is so limp that it it constantly tangled. It has frustrated me enough to stop using them. I have come to despise them since I have to spend 1-2 minutes untangling the cord each time I use them. Sony: FAIL. Avoid."
3,Soft Comforts,"This gentle, amused, and sympathetic book is rather like a warm quilt on a chilly night. The situations are compelling, though not all the characters succeed; the hispanic maid's English is annoying to anyone who knows a lot of recent hispanic immigrants! But she ties the story together into a very readable book, in which the religious elements are integral and attractive -- no easy task! It would be enjoyed most by a devout Protestant reader, but it's pleasant for anyone."
1,Buyer Beware!!,"I just returned my Mintek 26"" LCD HDTV. The company is currently out of business. They were implicated in portable DVD players with batteries that caught on fire, back in 2005. The issues are consistent for all of their products; they work fine for a brief time, then either the in-slot DVD stops working, or the buttons on the actual TV stop working, making it impossible to watch anything but the last DVD you put in (in my case, it was my son's Thomas the Train video. I still have nightmares). All that being said, please do a thorough internet review before considering ANY Mintek product!!!! Most companies will stand by their warranty, even after going out of business. These guys do not!!"
2,"Sylvia is so good, but this was so disappointing . . .","I have thoroughly enjoyed Sylvia's other CDs and found them informative and enjoyable. This one begins with a ""psychic comedy routine"" which I found profoundly unhelpful. If I wanted comedy, there are plenty of places I could have purchased it. It then goes abruptly into a short guided meditation, and ends with a question and answer session, with personal questions from the audience. Frankly, it was not worth the money or the time unless you want something very light and ""fluffy"". Go to some of her other works."
4,Cleanse the Spiritual palate,"After listening to many serious, thoughtful tapes on spiritual and psychic development, I found this one to be a refreshing take on the subject.We shouldn't take ourselves too seriously and this short live audience recording is a welcomed change of pace. I'm not a Montel watcher so many of you who are, might find this material somewhat familiar. I enjoyed it & would recommend it to those who are on the journey. Don't expect any great revelations but you will get a good lighthearted treatment of the subject."
5,did not make me itch,"Most mascaras make my eyes and eyelids itch. This mascara is gentle and easy to remove and best of all, no itching!Great for every day wear. It is very subtle so don't choose this one for a dramatic look."
1,Poke my eyes out boring,"This book is probably a dream to history buffs of that era. I, however, am reading this book for a college class. I am on page 91 and so far it is one of the most boring and dry books I have ever read. The diary entries are not so bad. The massive amount of commentary surrounding the diary entries...that's what's cooking my goose. Too much long, boring, redundant, dry commentary."
1,Bored to Tears,"So boring I couldn't wait to put it down. The author took a dry, fairly boring diary and turned it into an incredibly dead, irritatingly uninteresting mess. Anyone who gives this book more than two stars must be either a)a student working on a thesis about this topic; b)a relative of the author or c)nuts. My sister-in-law and I both bought it because it was recommended (by a historian and museum curator...go know...) and it had a four-star recommendation. We are both really disappointed and neither one of us is finishing it. Stay away."
3,If not assigned...,"This book has some good facts and insights of the womanly world of post-revolution America. Yet, if this was not an assigned homework in a college course I would never have read it. It would have been much more interesting if I knew more information about the area and main people involved in the history aspects of the time. The author assumes the reader knows most of it already and it made for a confusing read."
1,looks better in the picture,"I should have been skeptical when I saw the inexpensive price. The fabric (if you can call it ""fabric"") is so thin and flimsy...it's practically see-through! I would return it, but it's not worth spending the money on the postage to do so."
2,Kids White Chef Apron and Hat Set,"The apron is a little bit short for 6-year-old kids, and the hat doesn't fit them either. I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,Implausible exegesis,"This is an eclectic collection of essays which attempts to argue that from its birth Christianity included amongst its members individuals who were socially powerful and played prominent roles in the cities which they inhabited. This is an interesting thesis and one pushed by many of the ""Tyndale School"" based in England, of which the author is the chief figure. However, the exegesis pursued by the author is often strained and his knowledge of the Graeco-Roman world which the Christians inhabited is woefully inadequate. Consequently the thesis is implausible. It seems to owe more to wishful thinking on the part of the author and his sponsors."
4,High quality audio & video playback,"I bought this player in 2001, about 18 months ago, and I have had no problems so far whatsoever, performance has been very impressive. I have connected it with regular components, a Panasonic widescreen TV, a Sony surround receiver. The Pioneer's been reliable and above all good quality, it shows the expertise of Pioneer in the field of disc players."
4,a rare treat,"i found this book at an ancient book store somewhere in India.It was lying there in the shelves with dusts and webs.The moment i saw it i have to have it.And since i'm a huge Tori Amos follower,anything with her name is a must!.But i found something else too,and i also loves the Sandman Comics,this book is a lot of things to discover.Written by well known and acclaimed writers in various fields,its a bonus to have this book if you are an avid reader of the Sandman comics.Some of the stories are realy disturbing and dark,some are also enchanting,true to the Sandman style.Its a collectors dream."
5,Excellent resource for beginner grillmeisters,"This book gives excellent guidance for beginner and experienced grillmeisters alike. From explaining the basics of charcoal and gas grilling (laying a firm foundation of knowledge)- to making sake chicken with a wasabi rub - to grilled peaches(!), Steven Raichlen has written a masterpiece of practical grilling instruction. His writing is straight-forward and conversational, and he will improve your skills - and repitoire of recipes - in no time. Why make mistakes and waste your time and money? Read Steven's book and benefit from his experience. Highly recommended for anyone who is just starting grilling, and others who know they could have better results if they just knew what to do."
5,Eminently readable and intereting outline!,"The book is, as the title indicates, a ""concise"" history. Very concise, and incredibly well written! The authors cover a lot of ground, and so few words are devoted to character development or the broader context of historical events that one might expect the book to read like an almanac. But the Duggans do an amazing job of giving us an emminently readable, interesting, and cohesive outline of Italy's political history. Through an excellent (almost poetic) economy of words, they have fully realized the book's potential."
3,"Good, but not as good as her other, non-Biggest Loser DVDs","It is a good workout, but Jillian's ""30 Day Shred"", ""No More Trouble Zones"" and ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism"" are better. However, I thought the ten-minute upper-body workout was tough. I consider myself to be in decent shape from doing her other workouts, but the renegade rows and flies and extra push-ups (after the first workout) were killing me. Her other DVDs seem to get my heart rate up higher, though. All in all, I don't regret buying it. I'll do it once in awhile, but not as often as her other DVDs and running on a treadmill."
3,For Hardcore Tennant Fans Only,"This movie is absolutely terrible, but... David Tennant, still an unknown here is, as always, fantastic. Somehow, he manages to spin gold out of manure. He's the reason I watched in the first place, and I'm happy to say that he positively dazzles. The rest of the cast, however, is nothing short of awful. The chick playing Barbara is the worst; her acting was no better than a kid in a grade school play, and she had absolutely zero charisma and not an ounce of chemistry with any of the men vying for her character's attention. Indeed, said character is vapid and unlikeable, so the viewer never quite understands why Richard (Tennant) was so taken with her in the first place. (Obviously, the films's screenwriters were responsible for that.)Bottom line: LA Without a Map is the kind of film only hardcore David Tennant fans, like myself, could enjoy."
2,Maybe for Beginners....,"After reading glowing recommendations for this book, I had to have it. I read through it in no time and learned absolutely nothing new. In fact, I went back and read it a second time before submitting this review, just to make sure I wasn't missing something. I was thoroughly disappointed in the amateurish presentation and style of projects presented. If you're looking for a book on polymer clay, there are much more useful books on the market, even for beginners. Spend your money on Donna Kato's book, for starters. Skip this one."
3,Glucerna,They were okay. They seemed to be a little bit melted and/or old-tasting. Perhaps it was in the shipping process.
5,I wish I was this smart!,"I use to have a very low opinion of economist until I read this book by Mr. Cooke! I have read this book 3 times and I am always picking it up every once in the while to check some idea or facts. I have always wondered if Peak Oil will cause massive inflation or deflation or both. I am deeply impressed at the amounts of data and the computer models that Mr. Cooke used to come to his conclusions. I wish I was this smart! I would be writing books rather than reading them. If I had only 3 peak oil books to recommend, this book would be in the top three! Regards, Keith, Peachtree City, Ga."
5,rlsandy,these cases are the best protection for my camera and the price was the greatest.would most likely order from this vendor again
5,Magnificent Book,"This book is magnificent. It is one of the most human accounts of the Holocaust. It is exciting, tragic, triumphant, and beautifully written. A must-read."
1,Clearance Problems w/pulleys,These pulleys are designed for GM vehicles. Not all pulleys are exact fit as described. I went to install pulley on my vehicle with a 4.1 motor and discovered that the pulley would not spin due to a clearance factor. No spacers were provided with pulley. Be carefull as to what an exact fit really means. Part is not defective. It just won't fit all vehicles as described in their exact fit description.
5,"Good fit, good looking, nice feel","Aside from these being solid, good looking, and well crafted shoes. I ordered the wide size and it fits my wide feet nicely. Too many brands offer wide sizes but they feel just as narrow.Note: these shoes have leather soles and all the associated traits of leather soles. If you don't like leather soles, don't get these shoes."
2,Low quality,"These shoes fit great and they were shipped quickly. As soon as I received them I sprayed them with leather protector which I have used on other brand of shoes (Florsheim, Allen Edmonds and Johnston and Murphy) when I sprayed the Bostonians the leather pealed. I have never had this happen. They appear to have a shinny coating painted over the leather which I have never seen on shoes before. It's too bad because they fit great but unfortunately they look terrible."
5,Bostonian Andover Cap Toe Shoe Review,"Form, Fit, and Fashion, this shoe has it all! Beautifully crafted, comfortable fit, and looks great! My husband needed a new pair of dress shoes after wearing out his other pair of Bostonians, and this shoe fit his requirements. He said that they were so comfortable, that they did not need to be broken in. A nice pair of shoes that look and feel great help him to look and feel great, and these shoes do just that. THANK YOU !!!"
2,Disappointed,"I was looking for a less expensive solution for holding a white board. Unfortunately, this easel is so flimsy that I will likely need to purchase a different type."
1,I'll keep my money,"I, like many, many others, really like the show. I think the plot lines are what make the difference; the producers really know how to tell a story. So, they should tell the marketing execs the story of how they are leaving TONS of money on the table by releasing these series in volumes, instead of full seasons. Stupid sales strategy that keeps the real fans of the show and parents of kids who really love it from buying, especially since I can record the shows on a DVR and play them whenever I want. I'd rather have the discs, but won't waste money on a ""volume 1"" set of 4 episodes."
1,Still?,"I really do want to buy this series, but like most others, I refuse to buy in any other format besides a full season. Dont know what market exec thinks this is a good idea, but I've seen it done across a variety of shows and its really lame. Its like they think we have a ton of disposable income or lack the patience to wait for the full season. Sorry, not buying unless full season."
4,Cute train.,"My 3 year old really wanted ""the little blue engine"". This was the only option we found and the best price. It is small and wooden and works on our Ikea tracks. Overall good purchase."
2,MP3 Sound Too Fast,I just bought an I5 and downloaded some CD's onto the I5. The CD songs play too fast. Sounds like mice singing! I can't find any information on revising play speed. I downloaded songs from 2 different computers with the same result. No help from COWON. The support on their website is worthless.Try a Creative Zen........
2,"Controls not simple enough, 1Gb just too small","So, I bought this for my wife. But when trying to configure it, I realized that she was never going to figure out how to use the two controls to navigate around. I actually had to read the manual to figure it out, and I am very technically oriented.Also, when I dragged music onto it, it only held about 12 CDs worth - just not enough. I sent it back and got the Zen Micro. It is a little more, but is vastly more usable, has 5GB of space, has the FM radio, a bigger, more readable screen, but the entire zen unit is still pretty compact, about 2x the size of the i5).We are happy w/ the Zen."
2,Inadequate for anything but the simplest design,I found this program inadequate for my needs. I could not figure out how to add a dormer to the house nor could I find any delivered plans that have a dormer. The search engine for the delivered plans is inadequate. It should allow you to specify number of bedrooms and bathrooms in your search criteria whereas it only allows you to specify 1 or 2 story.
2,Not very good,"I did not find it very user friendly. It does not have much furniture choice that you can incorporate into your plan and if you design your house with the walls without using the sample rooms they have, it doesn't let you put furniture in your blue print. I asked a question of Tech support 7 days ago and am still waiting for an answer. (I don't believe tech support exists)."
1,"Many faults, impossible unless simple",Will work for simple square designs. Fun to do until it matters. Work will disappear anytime. Moving or changing walls can be impossible. Error massages are frequent but useless and stop progress completely. Figuring out the problem can be impossible and the plan has to be abandoned. Makes you want to run to an architect. Maybe that's the real plan. I have designed homes before the good old-fashioned way.
1,It burned fast... then it burned out!!!,"This is the second one! I received the rep[lacement under warranty and guess what?! It died too! after about just over a month of use. Sticking to brand from now on. No more chinesse cheapo burners.My old HP still kicking after 4 years, thats quality! Its true what they say, you get what you pay for. Learned the hard way."
4,Good Product,"I bought this burner about a month ago and everything is still running very smooth. It was easy to install, and if you have any problems, just go to the pacific digital website and have an online operator help you. Overal, it is a really fast burner at a great price."
1,Very confusing and difficult to use,"This book is one of the worst textbooks I have ever used. The text of the book is hard to follow and some of the some of the examples it uses are not technological relevant. While the book does explain a few concepts well, most of the more difficult ones are explained in a verbose and incoherent manner. The problems at the end of each chapter are probably the most helpful part of the book because most of the solutions are right (the solutions aren't included with the book, you need the solution manual). Overall, the book made me more confused on the entire topic of signals and systems. In fact, I didn't open the book after the first week of class because it was so useless."
5,Wonderful work!,"I must say i was a little skeptical about buying this DVD because of some reviews (1 star <_< ) but then i read some other reviews helped me buy it, and i think i do not regret it. Even though it is not live at some people complain, still a wonderful work. She really plays the sax in a nice way and with ease. It is a really entertaining DVD that i watch most of the time cause it is wonderful. So as one reviewer said, if you are a Pam fan, purchase this DVD, i think it is a nice investment if you like her music."
2,How could concise seem so long?,"The first thing that came to mind as I trudged through Macintyre's wordy book was how could something called ""concise"" seem so long? This book is informative but entirely humorless, like reading an ingredient list. Macintyre seems more concerned with showcasing his vocabularity then with enticing you with the facinating history of Australia's past. There is plenty of information in this book if you can make it through to the end while maintaining consciousness. If you are about to visit Australia and you are looking for an entertaining and informative book to stimulate your enthusiasm I strongly recommend Bill Bryson's In a Sunburned Country. If you are looking for a strong sedative then this is the book for you."
5,The Best Carmen Ever!,One of my favorite Operas of all times!Julia Migenes is the perfect Carmen! Placido Domingo is great here. I lost my copy and I have to say that this version is a must if you are a Bizet admirer! One of the best operas ever ! You must get this version! it is the best one! I could not see myself alive if I did not own one! I love it! It is my inspiration! Just Beautiful!
5,typecast carmen,This is a great way for non-opera folks to experience opera. They will know what is said (sung)and the casting is wonderful without sacrificing the quality of the singing. Highly recommended.
3,Confusing and lots of mistakes,"My friend looked it over. My friend passed the CCNA and is working on CCNP. There are lots of mistakes with the Cisco commands. The book is good in terms of being practical and shows the practical on the job aspect of Cisco. I got it cheap discounted so I don't mind. It's a dense little book and alot of info implies you work in networking. How many newly minted CCNAs or learning CCNA's understand DS3's going into a Cisco router?However, it is a decent book that shows how it is working as a network engineer and not just learning routing academically."
3,I just feel its not for beginner..,"no any basic info about router, too many technical terms which never explained... but if u are advanced user, i believe this book is a good reference for u."
1,Attachment of ear cup breaks too easily,I agree with the other reviewers who noted the ear cup attachment broke too easily on these headphones. When mine were delivered one of the ear cups was already broken and I had to send them back. Didn't even get a chance to listen to them but based on their lack of structural integrity I will be going with one of the Sony products.
2,"Good sound, unfortunately plenty of static",I bought these yesterday and returned them today. No matter where I put them I had static and a definate whine in the background. The static I could have handled. The whine though was just to much to tolerate for a 249$ product. I was going to use these for movies and I must say the actual sound is better than my Sennheisser RS65's. I really would have liked to have kept them but that high pitched whine in the background was just to much.
1,A Piece of Junk,"Got an AW791 for Father's Day. What a disappointment! Extreme static at any location on freshly charged batteries. Manufacturer says you can use them up to 300 feet away from transmitter. That's not my experience. I get cutouts in less than 60 feet. I should have figured it was junk when the salesman said he had only sold one and that one was soon returned (he didn't know the customer's complaint). Oh well, live and learn."
5,Real Patriotism Through Extraordinary Music,"In the wake of considerable ersatz patriotism following 9.11.2001, I have become more appreciative of genuine patriotic gestures. Recording these very American songs, with a tremendous commitment to showing them in their most pristine and revealing light, is one of those, perhaps small, acts of patriotism that are profound in their ability to show the best of the United States of America.I used the word ""commitment"" in the above sentence because that is the underlying theme of this entire venture. Ms. Danton sings with amazing clarity of voice and tremendous enthusiasm for the material. Each of these songs is a minor masterpiece, as presented, and the whole album is captivating and deeply compelling. These songs stay with you. I find myself humming the melodies for days. They are, indeed, songs many of us grew up with or have heard for years. So there you have it: 5 stars for the material, 5 stars for the performances and 5 stars for the recording quality."
2,Disapointed,CD was not what I thought it would be but On a Clear Day was good. The rest of the CD just did not click with me.
3,"Great Book, Terrible Print Job","It was nice to see the book reprinted and I hope the rest of the series follows. The book itself is very clever and witty, deserving 4.5 stars. Unfortunately, the publisher has numerous typographical errors and several odd marks in the text that look like software errors. For example, there are many instances where the characters ""@I"" precede a word in brackets, which leads me to believe the publisher was trying to create italics but failed. In other areas, a small square replaces a letter, indicating a missing font. I can't believe the publisher would allow the bookout the door in this condition.Unfortunately, it is either buy this version or spend a lot buying an OOP version. If I have to, I'll keep buying these over OOP, but I hope any future volumes are proofread first."
2,Junk,Works great for about 3-4 months then all of the digits on the led start to light up and some go out. You can never tell what time it is now. I did like the big display while it worked however.
3,Good clock but way too bright,"This clock is good for near sited people. The numerals are large and easy to read, and the clock works well. It keeps good time, the alarm is not too loud so it does not shock you out of bed, and the controls are easy to use and out of the way of the snooze bar. However, even on the low light setting, the clock is like a night light illuminating the room. If it is on the bed stand next to you, that is a problem. I think a similar clock with red LED's is a better choice. (This clock has green numerals.) Now I am looking for a gray plastic film to cover the face of the clock to reduce the brightness."
1,Cracks after it dries,It was easy to apply but was hard after it dried. Then it cracked and fell apart. I wouldn 't recommend this to anyone.
2,"Works, but not as good as I expected","This product works. It repairs the tear in the leather, but not as good as it shows on the cover picture. I used this to repair Leather on a leather jacket.When the repair is done you could tell that there was some patch-work done and the repair is a bit shineyer than the actual leather. I used the whole container of black leather repair liquid trying to get my repair to look right and I still didn't get it looking exactly the way I wanted it to look because there were always bumps or dents in it and I didn't think it looked its best."
3,Classic,This book is destined to become a classic. Jolitz and operatingsystems is like Knuth and algorithms. Its a shame they provokedso much envy by sharing the secrets of kernel design that moststill don't know.
1,Waste of money,"Do not buy it. Just don't buy it. It is not submersible. It doesn't heat up well, and it is spotty when/if it does heat up. Just stay away from this pan."
4,Jewelry with Found Objects,"I borrowed copy of this book from a friend and liked it so much I needed my own! So now I have it and love it! Thank you.All my books have arrived in perfect condition and ahead of schedule. Thanks again.Shirley L,"
1,Greatest Book Everhowever this has to compete with the least Readable.,Here we have the greatest book ever written and suffer with the poorest unreadable version ever.Three columns and very tiny print....I am giving away the 11 copies I bought but there are not a lot of takers.Great concept. Poor delivery.Gail
1,Less than impressive fiction,"The first half of this novel includes a lot of gratuitous sex and violence, which is not necessarily a bad thing. But it then seems to degenerate into endless racism and sexism. The second half, while slightly more coherent, is plodding."
1,Better than the sequel.,"Sure it's got plot holes, characters that are more than a bit inconsistent in their use of magic, and seems to be derivative of most mainstream mythology that came before it, but at least it's not as delusional and pandering as it's sequel, The Book Of Mormon. Multiple wives? Really? Magic underwear? wow"
3,Quite interesting in parts,"Unfortunately the plot is a bit confusing, and the author keeps changing his mind about what happened, so it's hard to follow at times. The author also overdoes the moralising a bit; at some points the book is almost preachy in tone.Although God (a bit like Gandalf or Dumbledore) is the main character in the book, his son also plays a significant part -- it takes a while for him to make an appearance, though; it's not until halfway though the book that he shows up. He comes across as quite a nice guy, but slightly delusional with sociopathic tendencies."
2,Surprised by the small print,I think the cover is beautiful but the fine print is veryhard for me to read. Would not recommend for thosewho need at least regular size print.
1,Bible-NKJV,It is much harder to navigate in this version than the King James or English Standard Versions. Probably won't use it much
2,not what I thought I was getting,The description said it was a leather bound Bible and when it arrived it was leatherette.
1,seriously obsolete. look for a newer edition,"this edition is ridiculously off-the-mark. i mean, it provides some wonderful guidance on how to live your life, but when i try to apply it, it just proves impractical! i tried to follow it's advice and sacrifice my son and sell my daughters into sexual slavery. now my neighbors look funny at me. i think they all need to be stoned, but there is a shortage of useful stones in the neghborhood!!! how does the author envision people following the teaching???"
2,NKJV,"A great version, that should have better search software. It is very slow to find somethind you want ot look up."
4,PERFECT...!,"VERY NICE BIBLE FOR ANYONE. FONT SIZE IS VERY GOOD, PAPER QUALITY IS EXCELLENT. OVERALL FOR THE MONEY IT WORTH."
5,The Holy Bible New King James Version,"The book was everything i exspected,it came in great condition,the print is a small so it would not be good for people with very bad eyesight."
1,It's not a King James Bible,"The term ""JEHOVAH"" is completely omitted.While passing off as being true to the Textus Receptus, the NKJV IGNORES the Receptus over 1,200 times. In the NKJV, there are 22 omissions of ""hell"", 23 omissions of ""blood"", 44 omissions of ""repent"", 50 omissions of ""heaven"", 51 omissions of ""God"", and 66 omissions of ""Lord"". The terms ""devils"", ""damnation"", ""JEHOVAH"", and ""new testament"" are completely omitted.The word ""Jesus"" is omitted from Hebrews 4:8 and Acts 7:45.The New King James Bible is a Counterfeit. Can't live by every word of God, when words of God are omitted.Luke 4:4 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.(King James Bible)I do not recommend it, purchase at your own peril."
3,The Bible,"My prospective on the Bible: The manifest content of the book seems to be, well, a fairytale. The latent content not so bad. Really bloody book fueled by a mean dude in charge. Lots of action early on, tons of wars, slaves, swords, rape and baby killings. New main character tries a different approach from his dad enters the scene and makes everything better with forgiveness. Spoiler: He dies, bloody too, awesome scene. Such an awesome scene they tell it four times. Promises to come back and act like his dad. Kinda lengthy. Good, not great book, I give it a 5.5 of 10."
2,Finally NKJV for the Kindle .... But no chapter navigation,"I have several Bible translations on my Kindle (NIV, NET, ESV, NKJV) and I waited for months for the publisher (Thomas Nelson) to finally release the Kindle edition of the NKJV. I went so far as to write to the publisher and was told that they were taking time to make sure they got it just right. The other translations have the table of contents setup so that at the beginning of each Bible book the chapters have links so that you can jump to them. With the NKJV Kindle edition there are no chapter links so to get to Isaiah Chapter 50 you have to page through until you get there. To make matters worse, you can't tell what chapter you are in except on the first page of each. (see the NET Bible which has chapter and verse notation."
1,Thou shalt be bored,"This anthology of ancient mythology is boring beyond belief. The Norse, Greek, and East Indian myths are much more scintillating."
2,Navigation is still poor in 2010 on Kindle 3.,Many of the reviews here discuss the print edition not the kindle edition. Navigation on the kindle is very very poor. I am using a kindle 3 and cannot navigate directly to any specific book and chapter without an absurd number of button clicks. If there is some shortcut keystroke jump method I cannot find any documentation about it. Frankly this product is a textbook example of the problem that ebooks can actually deliver an inferior experience to paper if they are not designed carefully. If you name any Bible reference I can turn to the location in my paper NKJV easily in seconds. In this kindle version it will take much longer.
2,Very disappointed!,"I'm a fond reader of the NKJV Bible and have been searching reviews to purchase one for my Kindle Touch. I had previously read several reviews of this particular one and noticed that people found it difficult to navigate. However, when I checked back, the description used all caps to state that it had NEW navigation, implying it is revised and issues addressed. I did not find this to be true. It may be fine for just reading, especially daily reading, but to use it along in a sermon at worship or in a bible class, it's useless and very time consuming, which defeats the purpose of a digital version. Thus, I have returned it and will continue to search for one that I can use for all purposes."
4,pleasing,"I found the nkjb extremely pleasant to use and read,but would have liked a larger print. AT my age such small print is not very easy to read,but I dont know if that is available.but again,it is first class material, and service is up to amazons usualstandard. yours: samboy."
1,"I was deceived. I received the book, but it is a different book from the image on the web site.","Before I bought this book, I clicked to ""see Inside"" that shows two columns with explanation of short paragraphs. But the book I received has tree columns with tiny print. I want to return the book. I want a refund for my book and for shipping. I have not heard anything yet."
4,Great Content but poor material.,"This bible has great content and design but poor material. I love the NKJV translation for it's originality but this particular book has some issues of construction.First the positives: large prints and great presentation. Words of Jesus in red. Now the negatives: paper is too thin and the print bleeds through. This makes it impossible to highlight interesting passages and phrases without rendering the reverse page illegible. The leather cover is poorly glued to the underlying pages and mine is already separating without being subjected to any form of abuse. This is sad because this bible is portable despite having large prints and would have made a great travel bible and gift but for the aforementioned shortcomings. TheESV Classic Reference Bible, TruTone, Brown/Cordovan, Portfolio Designis better put together even though a different translation."
5,A present for my hubby,My husband's old bible was worn and torn from being used so much. And this bible was a perfect replacement for by husband's old one. He loves the fact that the reference is not in the middle section of the bible but it's on the bottom.
4,Large Print NKJV Bible,"I am very happy with my Bible, which is much easier to read, and I am very satisfied with the service provider as well. The Bible received is exactly as advertised: Brand new and in excellent condition. It did not get here as quite as quickly as I thought it would; but I was in no hurry (or I would have order quicker service)."
1,Review from an Atheist,"The bible isn't horrible, if you've read it and think of it as only a fictional story, it is pretty good. However, I can't give this more than 1 star, just for the fact that it has mislead so many people into thinking it is true. This is my opinion, not just ramblings from an idiot, so if you belive in it, I mean no disrespect, as I personally respect your decision as well if you are Christian. I just get so angry when I turn on the television and someone is being sued/fired/jailed/etc. just because they aren't Christians, and lets be truthful, it happens a lot. Jews, Atheist, and all other people of religion/non-religions are persecuted for damn near everything, while Christians slip by the system unnoticed."
1,Writing too small,"I love Amazon, so this is not personal. The writing in the bible was the smallest writing I have ever seen in my life. I don't even wear glasses and I still couldn't read the words without a magnifying glass. There really should be some indication in the description of the font size. The bible was a great price, only $2.99 but it would cost me twice that to return it, so I didn't bother. I notice that font size is indicated for large print bibles, but not for the others. In the future, I hope this will change."
5,b,I love it . I love the way I can touch and find so much info just by the symbols next to the words. great for kindle.
2,Cumbersome - Needs More Work,"This Bible version for the Kindle is cumbersome to use. It's not easy to get to a particular book or chapter without paging through. Even if you use the table of contents, you still have to page through there as well. Also, once you are in the particular book or chapter, there is nothing to tell you what book of the bible you are reading. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a really good, regular New King James Version for the Kindle yet."
4,NKJV Holy Bible,Such a wonderful way to start the new year. It is a very good tool for bible study as well as following the Pastor on Sunday Morning. I recommend it to all worshippers who are zealous about bible study.
2,ATV Cover,"Not good quality, nor does it fit. Also I returned this item on April 11th and still have not received my credit for the item. I would not order from this seller again."
4,Confessions-St. Augustine,This translation is used as the basis for the excellent teaching company course on St Augustine. I first read the confessions from my Harvard Classics. The reviewed translation was far better and every page has footnote references to scriptures quoted by St. Augustine. I was very pleased!
1,Ewww!!!,So I dislike taking pills and capsules and felt that liquid is better absorbed and much easier to get down. Boy I was really wrong on this one! The smell is a combination between vinegar and turpentine (lemon scented of course). Actually I could not detect any lemon scent whatsoever and trying to swallow this stuff kept activating my gag response. Can't do it! I'm moving to the powder form!
1,WORST INVESTMENT EVER!!!,"This was the worst printer I have ever bought. It continuously gave me an error message. I contacted the store we bought it from and they told me to contact HP. I contacted HP, and I got the run around. I have since seen this printer in other stores, and I have asked the sales associates about the error message; they had no idea how to fix it. One store even had one on the shelf for customers to see with the error message. I would never recommend this to anyone, as there are much better printers out there for about the same price...and companies that have a better customer service. REALLY BAD PRINTER AND CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"
2,Do NOT buy this printer!!!!!,"Right from the get-go, this printer refused to load paper by itself, forcing me to load the paper manually (as many other reviewers have found). In fact, it even has the gall to occasionally jam while it is printing, forcing me to pull the paper out of the machine in some unpleasant, paper-destroying (and possibly warranty-voiding) way, and retry my print job, only to have it mess up again. The only redeeming values to this printer are 1) it is an ok scanner, and 2) it works on both pc and mac. No, being on mac does not make the printing woes go away...Yes, I plan on ditching this sorry piece of work the next chance I get..."
3,Great... once installed,This printer produces quality photos (without bending the 4x6 paper unlike some other all-in-ones) and fast documents. I did have a problem getting it installed though. I spent 5 hours on the phone with HP support and they eventually gave up and sent me a new install CD. The new CD worked perfectly so I would advise anyone who has trouble installing to ask for the CD first rather than spend hours on the phone like I did.
2,"Prints fine, eats the ink","The printer prints just fine but it eats the ink. So many problems with the ink cartridges alone! It would try to print something and then an error would come up telling me to check the ink cartridges. So I would, then I'd replace it with a brand new cartridge and it would say the same thing after 5 printings tops! I'm not printing ink filled pages, I'm printing regular text, that's it. It's very frustrating, especially because of how expensive ink is."
1,"good product, bad dealer, I am disappointed in Amazon","This was advertised as a good condition used unit. It was shipped by a small dealer who just put the printer into a box with no packing. Needless to say, it arrived as a box of broken junk.After getting Amazon to help, the dealer offered to refund my money if I would pay $30 to ship it back to him. I did a google street view of his house and decided (1) Amazon will let anyone be a dealer and (2) judging by the dealers house/place of business, I doubted that he had any money to refund. I just took it out for the trash man to pick up."
1,Do not buy this!,I have the same problems as everyone else. Constant issues with carriage and/or paper jams. This is more than likely my last HP printer.
1,Very Poor Printer.,Printer constantly thinks it is out of paper and then jams when it does recognize there is paper. It always takes about two or three attempts to get it to print correctly. Do not buy!!!
1,Constant Paper Jam and Misfeeds,"I have used HP products in the past with success but this one is a severe disappointment. The print quality, scanning and copy features work just fine but like so many other reviews the printer constantly shows a paper jam or out of paper when clearly neither is an issue. It usually won't even start printing unless I am manually pushing the paper in when printing is about to start. It is VERY frustrating to use. When the ink cartridges run out I am junking it and getting a new all in one from a different manufacturer."
1,paper jams,My 1610 psc has had lots of problems with paper jams. It is nearly impossible to get the paper in the tray just right - either it jams or tells me it's out of paper or picks up 3 or 4 papers at a time and prints a line or so on each of them! Spend a little more money and get the HP 2100 or 2700 series. These work very well with no problems at all!
5,D-link print server,"Excellent device. All my 3 printers are back to work. I can print from any computer at my home. However, the installation instruction should contain several examples of configurations It will be easier to people without comp background."
1,The worst Print server ever,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !If you want to waste your time configuring and your money sending back to D-Link because there's no way to reset it, just go ahead. If not, just try another brand.If you really buy it, please think twice before setting a password : when you set your password, first, you have to know that the user cannot be changed and is Admin. Then, nothing tells you that password must be less than 8 characters. So if you set for example ""mypassword"" as your password, you won't have any error message but you will be surprised to see that it doesn't work and you won't be able to enter your settings again because the password is not ""mypassword"" but ""mypasswo"". And as I said, you don't have any simple way to reset the equipment. So D-Link advise you to send it back so they can reset it for you !This is the worst equipment I've ever tried.Forget it !!!"
1,Quick Start Manual Wrong,Warning! The printed Quick Start brochure that comes with this unit has a major error--the actual parallel port locations are reversed from those shown in the brochure. LPT 1 is shown as next to the power port. Actually LPT 1 is in the center next to the USB port. The manual on the disk is correct. Being well experienced in print server setups it took me a couple of hours of higher tech configuration testing before I found this inexcusable error by DLink. Configuration otherwise would have been a breeze. The unit works fine as a parallel port server-USB was not used. This low rating is to draw attention to this problem and is not a comment on the product which is fine.
2,Print Server Couldnt Meet My Needs!,"Unfortunately, I had to return the DP-300U product since I couldn't interface to my primary printer. I didn't know all printers wouldn't work. After talking with D-Link support, D-Link has a webpage indicating which printers are compatible with this print server, so I recommend you visit their website before buying this product for compatibility reasons.I needed a print server for my multiple computers and printers, but the compatibility issue nixed this one. My HP color printer using the USB port worked great, but my Canon laser printer using the parallel port didn't work. Some Canon printers work, but not mine. I'll keep searching for another print server.It has some nice features, but Amazon took it back and that's what's nice about dealing with Amazon."
3,Good Until You Need Support,"I had this device for a little bit over a year, and I like most people didn't opt for the extended warranty. In short, it died as soon as the warranty expired. It's the way hardware is and I'm fine with that, but Apple's support wanted to charge me $250 to have it repaired/replaced. That is almost the same amount as a new one, and certainly more than most of their competitors. When it worked, it was great; a device I truly enjoyed, but once it starts having issues, you better look for another device; Apple wont be of much help you."
4,review,"I'm not sure what byerfam is talking about, but I have my ipod registered on two computers. Neither of them have deleted my files. I've used an Archos 20GB mp3 player, and I find the ipod far superior. The ipod is considerably lighter and less bulky. The ipod is also a lot easier to navigate around the menu than the Archos. If you can only spend $200, then I definately think the Archos is your best bet. But if you have the money, upgrading to an ipod is definately worth it. I do find the ipod earbuds uncomfortable; look into purchasing other headphones. Also, if you're going to use your ipod with Windows and you don't have a firewire port, you'll need to purchase an additional firewire/USB 2.0 cable for about $20."
2,I hate the apple i-pod. It is overpriced and tacky,"The apple i-pod is a terrible waste of money, i could have bought a remote-controlled pooper scooper with the money that i wasted on that junk! Maybe when i do get my remote-controlled pooper scooper i can use it to scoop up the foul piece of SH** that the i-pod is. They are so evil aswell, those lousy apple people, they advertise it through celebrities such as 50cent, Obie Trice, Mary J Blige and Dr Dre by sending them free i-pods to show in their videos, they make me sick. My retarded pet monkey could have made a better Mp3 player than those old fossils at apple. In fact, they didnt even make it themselves, did they? They just got a Sony battery and a Toshiba hard drive and put them all into a pathetic plastic case, with chrome plating, which begins to peel off within 2 months of use. I SERIOUSLY reccommend that you do not go anywhere near this Mp3 player, get something worth buying, like a remote controlled pooper scooper."
3,Cordless Review,I bought this phone and loved it apart from the fact the volume level didn't go quite loud enough for me personally and sadly after only a few months it completely died!
2,Not Peter Allen,"If you want to really experience Peter Allen then buy HIS recordings and enjoy the songs as Peter sings them. Hugh Jackman, the singer, is not at all Peter Allen, the singer."
1,Did I see the same show as everyone else?,"Unfortunately, the Broadway production of ""Wicked"" was sold out of tickets when I was in New York last year, so I took a chance on The Boy From Oz, only because I loved Hugh Jackman in XMen.It was so awful I had to walk out midway during the second act. Those who say Hugh Jackman was a great singer are wrong, especially if you've seen him live. He was not vibrant, and his singing was restrained and ""safe"". He was more concerned about hitting the notes than actually expressing himself through song. And his impromptu off-hand comments to the audience were so stereotypically gay I laughed at how ridiculous it was.Not to mention that the songs are pretty much forgettable and boring. The one song I did recognize, ""Arthur's Theme"" is already pretty campy, and the others only go down from there.Don't waste your money. I can't imagine the original cast recording is any better. There's so much better music out there than this!"
5,"Gorgeous, Brilliant, Vibrant, Cool","This extensive collection of Josh ""Shag"" Agle's work is a beautiful and surprisingly extensive glimpse into the bold, curvaceous world of martinis and temptation that flows from Shag's seemingly endless imagination. With over 200 pages of high quality full-color prints, this book covers the grand breadth of themes and schemes that made Shag famous. This is easily the best collection of his work I've ever seen in print and I highly recommend it for any devoted Shag fan or indeed any modern art lover. Shag effortlessly captures the best of Mod and transforms it into an invitingly hedonistic world viewed through neon-colored glasses. An absolute must-have that you'll no doubt thumb through quite often, whenever you feel the need to escape into a life of glamour, excess, and beauty."
5,dinosaurs of T.rex,This story is about flesh-eating dinosaurs had different way to feeding themselves.T.rex is the most famous flesh-eating dinosaur of all time.It had sharp teeth-many were more than 6 inch long.
5,Wow!,"My son loves this book. Great illustrations, lots of cool facts. I think that it is maybe a 4th grade to eighth grade reading level, not 4 yr to 8yr level. It is a little advanced for your average four year old."
1,this stank...,"dull, flat and boring, sorry i spent the $2. I can't believe this garnered so many stars, I was totally misled by the reviews."
3,"Hard to get into, but likable hero","I had such a hard time getting into this book because I just didn't like the heroine. I began warming to her a little after a couple of hundred pages and couldn't like her until the end. I just had a hard time understanding what a good man like the hero could see in her, especially with the values that she showed early on (titles above all else), with the exception of some charity. And because I didn't like the heroine and couldn't fathom a loving relationship between the two of them, it was a really slow go for me. I found myself bored with their relationship and with the progression of it. That said, I really like Lorraine Heath's books and recommend many of them. This one just wasn't that enjoyable for me."
3,ATI 9000,"There are 3 versions of the ATI 9000 series- the 9000, 9000 Pro and the 9000 All-In-Wonder (with TV Tuner and output to TV).The 9000 Pro supports 2 (computer) monitors.It you wand dual output, read the box carefully. For some boards, the 2nd output means your TV with its limited resultion. For other boards it, can mean a 2nd computer monitor running at typical computer monitor resultion.ATI only provides free phoine support in the first 30 days after purchase. After that its $ by the minute - if you get a support person that doesn't know much, the call could get long and costly."
3,Good but could be better,"It seems everyone compares SCAR to SOILWORK. SOIL was great at Natural born chaos, everything after that sucked. SCAR seems to have gone in a better path of where SOIL tried to go. This album to me has 5 good songs: 1,2,3,5,7. The rest of the album seems to be filled with FILLERS, just something to give them a complete album. I recommend only if you are in the need for a band that has over shadowed the NEW soilwork. My opinion is that SCAR has a better sound and playing ability than the new soilwork, so there is no comparison between the two."
2,What a disapointment!,"When I ran across this book in a store one day, I quickly bought it. What a disappointment. Mr. Woodbury's photographs are excellent, and can be seen in a number of field guides, but the information accompanying this book is useless. For example, Mr. Woodbury lists the Regal Fritillary, shows a photo, and gives a range description without once mentioning that this butterfly has not been recorded from the eastern United States for many years, outside a few local populations. One is left with the impression that this is a butterfly that may be seen commonly. It appears that the text of this book was quickly thrown together to get it into print. Recommended for the photos only"
3,POOR HEAT,"Heat in the pet bed is very poor. It would be nice to have an on,off switch because Its hard to tell if it's working or not. Anyway my cat loves it,and I would buy the pet bed again. My cat knows what she wants."
3,probably wouldn't purchase again,The heated bed is ok but it does not get real warm. My dog will stay in it for a little bit but ultimately moves back to the couch and curls up in the corner. The bed seems to be more maintenance than it's worth. I think the dog would still rather sleep in front of the fire on the wood floor than in her heated bed.
5,Warm Doggies,"My ""girls"" love snuggling in their new warm soft beds. They are chihuahuas and hate the winter months but now they can warm up after playing in the snow."
1,Poor quality - didn't last 2 weeks!,There were so many positive reviews that I ended up deciding to order this item for my elderly 50 lb dog. It worked okay initially although the heat was very very low (and I think a lot of the heat was just from my dog's body). I washed the cover on medium speed after a couple weeks (which it said you could do) and the zipper now won't work at all - completely off the tracks. But I put it back on anyway and went to plug it in and the end of the plug that connects to the bed had completely warped so I can't even use it at all. It's now used as just a regular bed since the heat is busted. I also want to note what another user said about not being able to leave it plugged in consistently - that was a total hassle (for the 2 weeks it worked) because my dog didn't lay in it continuously and who has time to monitor where your pet is sleeping?
1,very dissappointing,The chew resitent cord that came with it was chewed through by my tiny malte/poo in about a week. The company (pet safe) told me to go stick it as chew resitent doesnt mean chew proof.....NEVER BUY A PRODUCT from pet safe...they are garbage
3,Worked as advertised - but cats in my house would use it,This was nice and cozy warm - exactly as I had hoped. Purchased for an older cat with arthritis - but he would not go near it - even with a bit of catnip rubbed on it. And my other 2 cats would not use it either.Gave it to a friend with several cats and dogs and it gets good use there.
3,WRONG SIZE,"Any OFFICIAL Scrabble dictionary would be expected to have the words, which it does.When I bought this book, I also bought the DIAMOND anniversary editioin of the game, which has a rotating board with storage drawers. I really wish that Hasbro would have thought about making the drawer compatible with this book, or vice-versa. The book ALMOST fits into the drawer. If they had thought about this, travelling with the game would have been so much easier."
4,Scrabble Dictionary,This is a great reference for those who like Scrabble; provides a lot of words that I didn't know existed.
2,Please leave the Underdark to Salvatore,"This author butchered the fantastic world of the Underdark laid out by R.A. Salvatore in the Dark Elf Trilogy, etc. The writing was not smooth and distracted from the story at many times in the book, not that the story was written all that well anyway. I did finish the book and will hopefully be happier with the next in the series, but I won't ever read anything written by Richard Lee Byers again."
3,Dark but good,"I didn't enjoy the first book as much as the second and third, however it set the stage for the evil, corruption and backstabbing that goes on in Menzoberanzan very well.The main characters Pharaun and Ryld are introduced and likeable (as much as you can like any drow.)"
3,teaching in multilingual east Africa,The central idea behind the book's papers is how to teach in the multilingual environment of east Africa. Many of the contributors are African educators who daily confront this issue. Different teaching pedagogies are offered and the efficacies of these are critiqued.Several chapters concern the teaching of English as a second language in these countries.One positive note is that the existance of multiple local languages can be considered positive. That these have survived after over a century of colonialism.
3,Sticky and Glue-like,This pasta came out very sticky and 'glue-like' for me. Maybe I cooked it wrong? Not sure. It did have a great flavor to it.
2,Not worth it,"I don't watch the show, so I didn't have any familiarity or expectations with the 'cast.' I bought this because the premise appealed to me: short workouts over 30 days to develop a workout habit and achieve a baseline of fitness.What a letdown! None of the exercisers seem to have any sense of rhythm. They're out of sync with the music and even with each other, which makes it difficult to follow. The two who are performing modifications aren't consistent either, e.g., they seem to each have their own version about how a given move should be performed. Add to this the generally 'lost' look that all of them share, as if they don't know what's coming next and they're waiting to find out, and this DVD becomes unnecessarily hard to follow smoothly.For the brand, I expected far better."
2,Too Easy,"Okay, I am really, really out of shape, about 80 lbs overweight and exercise rarely. This video was very basic and too easy even for me. For a more challenging workout I recommend the Power Sculpt workout instead."
2,One of the WORST!!,"I have all of the biggest loser work outs and by far this and last chance work out has been the worst. The contestants are good but they aren't ready for there own workout DVD. It had terrible cuing, it was just bad."
2,Not polished enough for me,"Decent product but not polished enough so I get frustrated with it so I'm looking for a replacement. The timing and queuing are often off, some of the cardios emphasize the quads too much so you burn them out too quickly and the banter gets old fast. I would recommend skipping this one for a more professional product. However, I do like the flexibility of the format."
3,Maybe 3 1/2,"A very easy to read, light-hearted romance. The book kept me interested but I was so disappointed in the ending. I felt like the author purposefully leaves you hanging so you will buy the next book. Most of the storyline focuses on finding the twin (the eldest - who will be the Duke) and then you are left wondering where the story went from there. I am not saying that every book needs an Epilogue but I seem to really miss them when they don't have one."
5,A real gem,"At a doll show yesterday, I found a dusty old copy of this book for $5. I had seen it on ebay for much higher, so I picked it up fast. It really is very informative, with lots of information on character and advertising dolls, as well as the most basic ones. there are copies of advertisements and newspaper ads for dolls and products, and good information. Just looking through it made me interested in different doll types and aware of ones I knew nothing about. Well laid out, good short information, great picture. Since my copy was pre owned, the previous owner had marked what dolls they had. Wow, a Dionne, a 1948 Ginny, I was dizzy with what they had marked off. I wonder where they are now ? Get this book, it is charming and informative."
4,Nice dust pan,"The dust pan took a long time to arrive, which wasn't a surprise (was quoted on the shipping). It does the job well, but there is always that line of dust that I just can't seem to get up with this dust pan. I usually have to get my oxo mini dust pan to pick up the dust remnants if I am feeling particularly motivated. It has held up well so far, does the job!"
5,Like New,The used book I purchased was like brand new condition. The price was reasonable and super fast delivery. Great purchase.Joseph Cortese
4,"Days of Vengence, An Exposition of the Book of Revelation","The book arrived in a timely fashion. It was a bit ""used"" with markings, but the seller had warned me of that. I am very thankful for it, because it is out of print and hard to find. Price was a bit steep... but obviously I paid it! Because I needed it. All in all, excellent service."
2,Not impressed,I've had this knife set just over 2 years now and have to say that I am not impressed. Not only do most of the knives have rust spots on them but the tip of the chef's knife has broken off and one of the steak knives has broken in half!I will definitely be looking at different brands in the future for a higher quality knife set.
1,Should not carry KitchenAid name,"I've had this set for a couple of years now so they've been put to good use. Unfortunately, this set contains very thin blades (one bent) and most have rust spots on them. Since they come with the KitchenAid brand name, I expected better. You do not get what you pay for. I have a cheaper and better set by another manufacturer. This set should sell for $19.99"
3,"should ""stainless"" steel rust this much??","before purchasing, i read the reviews and noted that i should hand wash these knives... and i've been doing just that and placing wet knives in my dishrack to air dry. maybe that's where i went wrong (i should have towel dried them as well?), but the knives still rusted, and that is NOT making me happy. i have another knife that looks just like these, made by Cuisinart, that DOES NOT rust, even when washed in the dishwasher. i'm wondering why these rust so much. isn't ""stainless steel"" supposed to resist rust?other than the rusting issue, the knives are very good. they are incredibly sharp. however, with the rusting issue, i wish i could return them..."
1,"Looks great, but doesn't hold up","We bought this set because of the look and Kitchenaid name. Unfortunately, after only a couple weeks these knives had rust spots all over them. This was only with normal use and hand washing. No problem with the way they cut, but if you purchase them expect to have a set of rusty knives."
3,Fine. Some writing in it...,Fine. Some writing in it...not sure that it was described in this way. Would have been adequate if I had elected to keep the book for the class.
5,"A ""must have""","If you get pleasure out of well-cared for clothes, then there is no better discourse on how to self manage their cleaning. We seem to have devolved to a country that sends almost everything to the dry cleaner. I don't believe in the necessity for the resultant chemical bath nor do I like the cost.Ms. Mendelson's book on home laundering is a boon for both novices and experienced washers alike. With her book, an iron and just a travel-sized clothes steamer, you will be thrilled with what you can do intelligently for yourself.This book is basically an excerpt from Home Comforts, The Art of Keeping House. I swear by that book also. I like having the laundering book as a separate entity because it's more portable size makes it easier to use. On a separate note - I think Mendelson's Home Comforts cleaning book and/or her laundry book are the ultimate wedding shower present(s)."
1,"Good features, but very poor quality speakers","I thought this phone was a great deal at $49.95 from Circuit City, that is, till I got my first call. The voice on the other end sounded so tinny and soft. I immediately clicked the volume button to increase the volume, but found that by doing so introduced some sort of feedback thru the speaker. My own voice was being affected by this interference. I never said anything to my wife, but she said the same thing to me after using it for a day and taking calls from other people. I took it back to Circuit City and ended up buying an AT&T E2725B set from Wal-Mart for $67. There is a world of difference in the quality of the sound. The Uniden set sounded like a really cheap phone in comparison."
4,New Concert of Classic Ska Band,"Good concert. Well filmed and the sound is excellent. They have only improved as musicians...though Terry seems to not be all there...his voice is better than before. Jerry Dammers is missing, which is too bad.Still, a fun show for all."
5,The best introduction to Dzogchen,"This is the most comprehensive general introduction to Dzogchen philosophy and practice, by one of the greatest living scholars and translators of this tradition. An unjustly neglected book that belongs on the shelf of every Dzogchen practitioner or scholar of Tibetan Buddhist religious traditions."
1,Screwed,"I bought a pair.The left one worked, the right didn't.I returned the right one requesting a new one,and i haven't heard anything from the company.it has been over six months. I will never buy anything from this company again."
3,Ontogeny of an ontologist,"Ontogeny describes the origin and the development of an organism from the fertilized egg to its mature form. Ontology is the philosophic study of being or existence. Colin McGinn takes the reader on a ontogenic journey from his youth in a mining town in northeast England to his arrival as a Professor of Philosophy at Rutgers University. His journey takes us through his choice of philosophy as a career, his personal philosophic questions, his answers (or non-answers), his initial rejection and later rise in prominence at Oxford University. We can sense his existential questions as he tries to apply the philosophy he teaches, the questions of ontology, epistomology, free will, fate and luck, to his own life. This personal history is very engaging and serves to humanize the scholar and soften the aloofness and arrogance we usually associate with a world class academic."
2,Writing for general public is not THIS easy,"Professor McGinn seems to be rather proud of his writings for the general public. I haven't seen the other popularizations, but I suspect that he has got a little carried away with his earlier successes.This is not an actually bad book, but shallow it is. You get a potpourri of anecdotes, how a poor boy goes to university and then enters a conveyor belt of promotions and job offers.In between the details of his CV you also get rather two-by-four style tutorials on (mostly) linguistic philosophy.And that's about it. No insights to speak of, no life-changing ideas. Very little about ""twentieth-century philosophy"". No story about how to make a philosopher.Good idea, lazy thinking, sloppy writing."
1,Compatibility problems,"This product is not compatible with HP Ipaq 1935, although stated. Will give error message ""STOP wrong personal ID"".What a waste of time - the protection of this product has evidently been made so good that the customer can't get to the dictionary he has paid for. Congratulations.This item is going back for a refund."
2,board of it quickly to easy,"This game was okay it was to quick meaning the bar health like virtua fighter, soul calibar, and dead or alive the bar health goes down to fast being that the attacks are powerfull that makes the game less as fun cause you play for like 1 minute then the computer is defeted or you are defeted thats to quick but this game was okay the story mode sucked and this is kinda the same as part4 so this was an okay game if you want to play it then rent it its not worth buying."
4,"Great, but need more","I really enjoyed this game for the 2 yrs that I owned it. I like the fact that Jin got his own storyline, and that you could give the characters a fresh new look. I just purchased Tekken 6 this Friday and can't wait to play it. When it comes to fighting games they tend to get old after being played for so long. I would hope to see a new generation in fighting games. In my opinion it would be awesome if Namco and Midway got together and combined Tekken, Soulcalibur, Urban Reign and Mortal Kombat all into one epic adventure and fighting game. Where you created your own character, create a team with other fighters, having a real objective to the game, and having the ability to roam through other worlds. This would give World of Warcraft a run for their money."
3,This game is a great fighting game. Modesty issues!!!,"This game is a great fighting game. I have serious problems with the dress of at least 2 of the female characters. Someone mentioned that you can earn points to dress them properly. It takes a lot of points just to buy gloves and hats, so don't think this will change unless you play this game every night to earn the points. I know for a fact that they have different outfits, but the standard ones for some are very exposing of certain female body parts. There is also a pool side scene that has bikini girls cheering on the fighters. Not good either!Be sides that, this game is pretty solid for older people, not for kids unless you can protect their eyes from the above concerns."
4,Digital Rebel Field Guide,"A much better guide than the ""Magic Lantern Guide"", it still centers on the controls of the camera, but does go into better detail towards the end of the book, about how to take better photos with it, if you only had one book to buy, buy this one first!"
1,There is more to write about this subject.,"It a good book about the camera... as good and maybe la litte better than the manual that came with it.I wish I would have found more on the tips, tricks and traps of digital photo with the Rebel, things like managing light and movement, shapes and contrasts.Maybe I was expecting too much, and I will have to learn the old way: step by step, sometimes feeling sorry for the photos I missed about moments that are gone, and some other time totally amazed by pictures I didn't expect to be good.But one thing for sure, I am not going back to my other 35mm Rebel Camera."
5,"A worthy additions to any fitness library, and highly recommended","Denise Austin hosts an excellent fitness DVD designed to help one quickly get into the habit of a solid, fat-blasting exercise regimen! ""3-Week Boot Camp"" (52 min.) offers two high-powered, twenty-minute workouts emphasizing cardio and strength training, plus a bonus Ab Fat Blaster section. A great addition to fitness libraries, ""3-Week Boot Camp"" lives up to its title as an exercise routine sure to help the viewer look and feel better in short time! Simple, inexpensive hand weights are advised to get the most out of the workout, and a music-only option is available. A worthy additions to any fitness library, and highly recommended."
2,Broken case should have been mentioned,"Be sure & let your bidding audience knwo the package is going to be busted up...yea the CD was ok but the disc case that is supposed to protect the CD is busted, twisted, & damaged - you should have mentioned that so I could have selected a CD that was actually ""like"" brand new for the same price."
4,Great workout at home,"I like a lot of variety in my activity, from running to strength training to elliptical to hula hooping. I exercise about 5 days a week, and it's not easy for me to get my heart rate up. This DVD kicks my butt. I often get more out breath than even when I run, and I love having the option of getting this good of a workout at home, especially now that it's winter. It's varied enough that I don't get bored, and because the activities are separated into 20-minute sections, one can get some exercise in without spending a lot of time. Hand weights are a must, and make sure the ones you get are easy to handle. There's a lot of passing the weights around, so keep that in mind if you're purchasing some to use specifically with this DVD.The negatives? I wish there was more stretching in the cool down sections, but one can always add that on themselves. And, of course, Denise is annoyingly chipper and can't count, but the great workout makes up for it."
5,Wonderful!!,"I just started this workout today. I have been doing Jillian Michael's Ripped in 30 and frequently find myself very sore the next day- yet still push through the pain. I have always been a fan of Denise Austin, she's sweet, encouraging and doesnt yell that ""she wants to bounce a quarter off your butt"" (which you would hear frequently if you do ripped in 30). I have several of Denise's pilates and yoga dvd's but this is my first cardio dvd; I am trying to find an alternative to running. I much prefer Denise over Jillian. The moves go quick, and I got lost for a moment, but I just rewinded and did it again- so I learned the move AND got more of a workout. Overall, it's a great workout!"
3,not my favorite,I love Denise and like to do various workouts of hers in addition to other trainers. I don't know why but she lost me in the middle of this one. She has better dvds.
1,Holiday SoundTrack Lacks Songs,"So disappointed, they didn't have the song Just for Now or any other captivating songs from the movie. It's very deceptive. I should have read the reviews before buying but this was the first time I had this happen.... BE on guard!!! You won't get the actual SOUNDTRACK, just background music from the movie. There were songs that Cameron Diaz sang along with and then the song that Kate Winnslet (sp) woke up to, but you won't find it on this CD. You also won't find the song ""Darling You send me"" they play at the end of the movie. I love the melody from the music as it transforms you to that place of love but this CD will leave you very annoyed!"
5,The Holiday - Soundtrack,I loved the movie and the music in the soundtrack. I wasn't disappointed when I received a copy of the CD soundtrack. It is happy and uplifting and makes me want to move and dance around.
5,Warning.......Only contains Hans Zimmer instrumental songs,While Hans Zimmer has composed some beautiful music on this CD..........this CD does not contain any songs (such as the Arethra closer) that many of you may mistakenly purchase this CD hoping to obtain.Not on this CD you won't.
3,Beautiful But Disappointing,"It is beautiful music which stays in your heart. What more can you ask from a romantic movie?! However, for me, the CD played like one long track. I was disappointed that more of a variety (that was on the DVD track) of music was not included."
3,Monitor a Call,"I just receive this telephone as a gift. The only thing I don't like, neither my wife, is that we can not monitor a new call from the handset. The previous answering machine we had, Bell Atlantic, we were able to monitor and either answer or let the machine pick-up. We do like all the other features this machine has."
1,The Buzzing is real!,"I purchased this phone because I wanted a relatively simple and reliable cordless phone/answering system with good sound quality. I found that the answering system is easy to use and the sound quality is acceptable (although not excellent). I was very disappointed with the sound quality of the phone itself, however. Like another reviewer, I could hear a very noticable and annoying distortion in the sound which in my case occurs whenever the other party is speaking. This problem showed up after about a month of use. I tried the tricks of changing channels and moving the phone location, to no avail. The phone is currently on its way to Memorex for repair. Based upon this experience, I would not recommend this phone to a friend."
5,reviva 10% glycolic acid night cream,"i have been using this product for almost 15 years, and it is the only cream i have found that will absolutely take 5 years or more off your face and throat! i will always use and recommend this!"
2,"It burns, plus it hasn't made any notable improvement in my skin.","I am 27 years old, with significant skin damage (freckles, fine line, etc.) from sun exposure. This product burns my skin (although there was no rash). It wasn't painful enough to stop using it, just irritating, so I continued to use the product for a few months to see if it would have any noticeable effect on my skin. No luck. My skin hasn't peeled, texture/color hasn't changed, absolutely nothing.The texture of the cream is nice, and it is somewhat moisturizing, so I gave it a couple stars."
3,good product but a bit too harsh for my skin,"i love the way this product made my face feel, but after the second use my face was irritated! I am going to use this product maybe once every other week to see if my face is more accepting of it. DIrections ask you to use a few times a week, and that was far too much for me."
5,And I Don't Even Speak French!,"I was ecstatic to find any CD by Pringle - even though I don't speak the language. I own most of his early English-singing works - on LP (and someone needs to get those transferred onto CD) and haven't heard anything new by him in years. I was thrilled to find this, and to find that his voice is the same incredible one I first heard 24 years ago! Even when you don't know the words, you know you're listening to pure art. I majored in Music in college and I have never heard anything quite like it. If you love to hear a beautiful voice - this is it. If you understand French - so much the better."
1,Cannot Use Multiple Handsets on the same call.,"I agree with all the other reviewers that the phone was easy to set up and the calls are very clear. We bought three handsets, and my problem is this: if I'm talking to someone and my wife wants to talk to them as well, she cannot get on the phone with them using these cordless phones. You can only use one handset at a time. I've owned multiple cordless phones before, and this has never been an issue. That seems like a pretty big feature to be lacking in the 21st century."
4,...you got the blues.,"I'm glad everyone else thinks this is as great as I do, cause I'm thinking evil."
3,The First Mixed Live was better,"The most annoying thing about this CD is that Carl Cox goes on the mic almost every track, making sure to say ""Detroit,"" just to get a crowd reaction. The sound is a little muffled also. Otherwise a good selection of music."
5,Good Book,"This book has great decorating ideas, and good information for a person just renting their first apartment. I would suggest it to that kind of person, or to someone looking for good decorating ideas."
5,Miracle in the Rain,"I love having access to old 1950 movies. This movie was very down to earth, sad and inspiring."
5,Van At His Most Endearing,"Having always considered Van Johnson my Golden Prince of the Silver Screen, I was charmed with his powerful portrayal of a lonely loveable soldier about to ship out to war. His happy-go-lucky. yet sincere manner. made sweet Jane Wyman fall in love with him, and also won over her suspicious mother. You will never forget the moving conclusion that makes this movie great. I am so thrilled to finally own a copy of ""Miracle in the Rain."""
3,Sad But Sweet,"I watched this during my bout with insomnia. Usually these movies put me right to sleep, but this one kept my interest up. It's a very sweet love story, with several small sub-plots that add to the entertainment. My problem with the movie was that I expected a better ending. I woke up this a.m. still confused on what exactly happened. If it ever comes on again, though, I will probably rewatch just to answer some of my questions. It's worth watching."
5,This album is a must have!!,"This album is awesome! I purchased this CD for the Bonus disk. The remixes are really good and the song ""Boom"" is her best to date!! This album is a must have for any fan of Anastacia! This album is pricey but worth every penny!"
1,Beware - Band breaks easity,"Purchased this watch on 12/14/08. Didn't receive it for about a week. Last night a wire link broke - standing straight up - catching on clothing. Contacted the seller Jomashop via Amazon's site this a.m. 1/27/09, to see if they would stand behind their defective product. The response - the purchase is over 30 days old. NICE. If you add a week for delivery that puts the time I've had the watch a hair over 30 days. BEWARE!!! You would think a watch that you pay >$60 for would last more than 30 days. What a shame."
1,Terrible Product,"I would suggest that you do not buy these. They taste NOTHING like Andy Capps Hot Fries, and are really hard. I guess if you like really crunchy fries, go for it. Also, my package was shipped in a complete mess. the box was all torn up with one only one piece of tape around the whole box. Hot fries were all over the bottom of the box."
1,No Dial Tone,"Got this as an X-mas present. Seems my MIL thought that our current Uniden DCT648-3 took to long to sound the message tone (30 Seconds after the machine message finishes)was bad!So she got us this one. Well after 8 days the phone would no longer connect to the phone line. The screen flashes ""connecting"" for about 10 seconds then displays ""unable to connect"". Tried different hand sets on the base, same result! Tried different cables, still the same!So I plugged the Uniden DCT648-3 back in and all is well except the lag time on the recorder. What the hell I like this one it displays the time and is a clear as a bell when talking!"
1,Into the garbage with this one,I've tried every place in my house can't hear a thing on either handset even with the volume on high. Most of the time all I get is static. I should have read the reviews before I purchased this item. Apparently Uniden doesn't intend on staying in business if they allow their name on a piece of garbage like this.
2,Dried Broken Fava Beans,"I was so looking forward to my dried fava beans. When I opened the box, I was so disappointed. The picture above shows nice whole fava beans with uniform color. The ones I got were all different colors with lots to discard and way too many broken ones, and I don't mean just broken in half...broken in lots of tiny pieces. I would never serve these to company unless I opened two or three bags and picked out the whole ones.The bags were packed nice and safe with plenty of bubble wrap. I can only assume they were this way when they were packed. I am very disappointed in the quality of these dried fava beans and wonder why Amazon even bothered to carry them. It is far below their usual standard of quality. You want fava beans? Skip these."
5,I've gained more self-confidence than I ever dreamed!,"Dr. Broder's audiocassette program taught me how to gain self-confidence and keep it! It didn't just make me feel good while I listened to the tape, like other audiotherapy products. And the exercises in the workbook helped me to really crystallize my thoughts and strengthen my self-confidence as I was learning. This is a terrific product - I recommend it to anyone who needs a self-confidence or self-esteem boost!"
4,really beautiful stuff,"I read about this band randomly on the allmusic guide and decided to check out their earlier records. They were definitely good and I can see why they are so critically acclaimed, but I must say that I think this is their most accessable effort. It's laid back like the previous record, but it seems to me that this is a more focused record and the songs are more consistent throughout. If you like the lo-fi type recording sounds of guys like Elliott Smith and Sam Beam I recommend this record, but expect much more in the sense of layering on sounds. Elliott Smith and Sam beam may be superior songwriters and singer in my mind, but this guy has some great stuff going on in the background. Definitely worth a listen."
4,"ELECTRO YES, NOUVEAU... NOT SO, SO.","I'm giving 4 stars to this CD for the only reason that MOONSHINE records took way to long to come out with a copilation of tracks that have been out there for months and for not including Miss Kittin & The Hacker.You will find tech-house, plenty of synthpop, nu-electro & a bit of high energy.I'm glad that they have included MOUNT SIMS ""Dark Sunglasses"" cause I love that track and Tiga's version of MADAME HOLLYWOOD by FELIX DA HOUSECAT and GUSGUS 'DESIRE'.This particular CD would have workd so lovely as MIX CD, since there is plenty of ELECTRO copilation ones out there and not many that are mix with the exeptions of TIGA'S American Gigolo & FELIX DA HOUSECAT, but, as a compilation CD is a good one and CD#2 Is my favorite, since most of the songs seem new to me and the beats are a bit faster than the first one."
3,Okay-ish,"its a true gamer game only, because of the newer games coming out it is really hard to make this one compete, but if you are a fan, its a good buy."
1,Boring does not even begin to describe this book....,"I am 70% through this book and I really do not care to finish it. I've stopped numerous times and find no interest in finding out what happened. At one point there seemed to be some sort of ""evil"" kidnapper who was going to show up but haven't read about him/them in awhile...Although, that could be because I've put the book down so many times because I feel like I am punishing myself because I just want to get through it.This is the first book by this author that I did not enjoy. I may purchase ones that were published before this book but I'll be hesitant to purchase any that were written after this one..."
3,VERY DISTRACTING!,"Yeah, I read S. Laurens for the 'bodice ripping' but this one was on the edge of stalking. Phoebe just couldnt get rid of him!!!!! I had to keep in mind that this romance was going to work out well, but had to put the book down several times because it went on and on and on. Enough already!Sensuality is a 9. That being said, I'm glad I stuck it out. The secondary plot was interesting given today's disappearances of our women in Aruba, etc. But was very glad to see all the Bastion Club come together to give Deverell a hand in rescuing Phoebe. (BTW, she should have received a slap upside the head for falling for such an obvious ruse.) :D"
1,This is Part Chimp?,"Well the folks at Amazon made a humorous mistake and placed the wrong listing of music on the new Part Chimp cd ""Chart Pimps"". Part Chimp are a loud, contemporary noise band. Please correct this... Scott"
5,very good album,I think these guys are really good. I have three of their albums now and they are all really solid. The best songs on this album are never win and we need a war.
4,Good source for learning about e-commerce,"I bought this book mainly for the CD that contained the behavior that facilitates the transfer of data via e-mail. To that end, I wasn't disappointed, and the book goes into detail about how to design a Director movie that can be used for e-commerce (this is the only book that I have found to do this). However, this isn't a book for beginners; some familiarity of Director is needed to fully grasp the content of this book."
2,Dry and Factual,"I fail to see how a book about a sexy, sultry woman who abandons heterosexual relations for a Lesbian lifestyle could be as boring as this book was in the sex category. Let's face it, sex is a juicy subject and this books turns sex into some that you would lay out on a stainless steel table and talk about pathologically at a medical conference.Mrs. Weldon was an outspoke representative of the ""insane"", insane assylum system in England during Queen Victoria. She is portrayed as a sort of anti-Queen Elizabeth type in the book. But again, there are so many juicy subject brought up in the book but they were never fully developed.In the end, the book ended up being dry and factual. It reminded me of writing a research paper on a famous person rather than a character biography that filled the pages with a real sense of who Mrs. Weldon was and what made her tick."
5,"Original printing of ""Waterbabies""","A haunting unforgettable read to my child in 1971. Includes sorrow, poverty, abandonnment, hope and forgetfulness. Surely not available these days, do not know the printing date but must have been the 1800's England. Chimney sweeps were much in demand in London those days and throwaway children just as prevalent then as now, let them sweep chimneys."
3,"Better wardrobe, better makeup, Less Strident","than the concert video. Hip-hop's answer to Charo returns with a self-love fest, but you know, there's a lot to love here. She is a hot puertoriquena. And from a certain angle, P Dudley does look like Xavier Cougat. File under guilty pleasures."
5,great cd,"I didn't really get into P86 till STBYBB came out. I saw the music video for Spy Hunter, and decided to get it. I was blown away. The whole cd is full of hard-hitting rock/metal tunes. I love all of them. This seems to be where Andrew really started perfecting his unique voice. The sound quality is really good as well. All, talented dudes. And that was before I read ""It's All Downhill From Here"" by Andrew Schwab. After reading the book, the cd was given more meaning. When you find out what they've been through, and what was going on when they created this cd, you really get insight into how Schwab thinks, and the real meaning behind the seemingly abstract songs."
4,Very good!!,"I had owned the independant release of this disc before purchasing the new album and i still agree that this is a great album. The three new songs that were added are great songs, i only wished they would have added a couple more. Standout tracks include, ""oblivion"", ""ashadow on me"" and ""breakdown3/4"". These guys are the most UNDERATTED band i have ever heard of and if music lovers only knew about them, they would be rushing to buy this disc. So do yourself a favor and get in on it. YOU will not regret it."
3,Darth Vader Gloves,"If you are into the whole dress up thing, I would say this item is perfect for that costume."
4,slimy science fun,"This toy is excellent for my science oriented 7 year-old boy. Not only does he get to mix and measure, but he gets a ball of slime to play with afterwards which is very soothing tactile play. The shelf life of the slime is not so great - storage in plastic bags have worked best for us. You make a batch of two seperate solutions for the whole kit, store them and use as needed. The directions for making the different slime could be better because it says things like ""add 1/3 of the solution"" which varies whether it is the first slime you are attempting to make or the 5th. Anyhow, its not hard to accomodate for and great fun for the kids."
3,Good to help you gain insight into Dr. Sagan's mind,"""Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science"" is a series of essays by Carl Sagan. I'm rather a fan of Carl Sagan's works and got this book expecting that it would be more of a focused book rather than the variously directed chapters that it turned out to be. I absolutely loved ""The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark"" and was a little disappointed by this work. Not some of Sagan's best work but still worth a read if you really enjoy his writing and can overlook when he starts to wander into the realm of overly zealous green supporter."
5,A time to think,"The skill of writing is to create a context in which other people can think. Sagan is a master of distilling scientific complexity for a layman's understanding.A fascinating journey through various aspects of science. There are few books in the world which can instill such wonderment for the meaning of things.Sagan was always opinionated, but seldom shows bias. He lets the reader make up his mind by asking the questions, not giving the answers.One of the pillars of any good book collection."
3,a novel about defeat or adaptation?,"This is the account of a teacher whose interest in insects lead him to a prison made of sand.He goes on a trip looking for sand beatles: he is very interested in the properties of sand as a life source.Can animals really live in the sand? He gets the answer to his question when he is trapped in a sand village where the villagers confine him to live with a single woman whose only activity in life is to remove the sand from her home so she won't be burried alive.The setting of the story is strange and claustrophobic, Abe's writting is clear, consive and manages to communicate the reader a sense of dispair, isolation and ultimate defeat. The ending is somewhat predictable, but one can only wonder whether the main character just gave up or if he simply adapted to his new way of life.A dark depressing book, worth reading if you share a similar outlook in life.."
2,"Bizarre, ends bleak","Kobo Abe came highly recommended to me by a good friend, and so I touched on the first of his books that I found: The Woman In The Dunes.I was disappointed.While it was well crafted, the sudden, abrupt ending left me scratching my head, wondering just what the point of the novel was. Perhaps it's a cultural difference, but it simply left me wondering why he bothered with this novel at all. It has a very unfinished feel, and despite the riveting descriptions of the ordeal within the dunes, the sudden turnaround at the end left me completely cold."
4,Translation,"Curious and skeptical, having read this wonderfulbook in german, I went to the few available samplepages to see inside the english version and findout what it would feel like in english. I wasimmeditely impressed by the sheer beauty of AntheaBell's work. I remember, years ago, whenI first read Shakespeare and then Schlegel & Tiek's translation,not being able to decide which I preferred.I will now read the book again in english, lookingforward to a similar (and very rare) experiencie,this time the other way round."
3,Just as I was about to give up.........,"As other reviewers have stated this can be a difficult book to read. The author's style, which is to ignore stylistic standards really did not cause me any pause. The difficulty was in his incredible but complex prose. Throughout the entire book, I felt that I was only picking up the surface meaning and that repeated readings would reveal several more layers.After reading approximately 1/3 of the book, I was ready to give up. However, at this point the novel began to detail Austerlitz's search for his identity. Austerlitz's journey to Prague drew me in, increased the pace of my reading and held my interest until the end. Will I read it again and discover what cannot be found by a single reading? Only time will tell.This is not a book for everyone. You have to be patient. If you read for simple entertainment, forget it. It was a true intellectual exercise and one I am glad I partook of."
1,I don't know why this book is rated so high,I bought this book because of the high ratings and my interest in history and holocaust stories and survivors. I don't know what book the others were reading but I couldn't even finish this book it was soo boring and dull. I tried really hard to get into this book but I just couldn't. I did just see another review saying that you may have to give it several chances so I may try this one again.
4,A very good read,This was a very descriptive and suspenseful book.If you are looking for a fast read this is the book for you.
2,Ivan....where's the color for you?,"I just recieved my copy of Ivan's latest self-portraits and I'm disappointed in the book. I've been a lover of his work since I first saw his painting in the old movie ""A Picture of Dorian Grey"", where he and his twin brother both working for the movie studio did the paintings. One doing the young Dorian and one doing the morphed, grotesque version of Dorian which Ivan painted. I was so hoping for something better. Its a small book with maybe one or two color prints of his later portraits. I understand that color is more expensive but really, why bother....its almost an insult to put a book together without HIS color! I'm keeping it only because I love Ivan, but come on....its like a cheap catolog from an exhibition where knowone really cared or loved his work."
1,Irresponsible,"I read this book after a recommendation from an author. I was intrigued initially by the Egyptian life but as soon as he described the raping of a 9 year old boy by an old servant and called it lovemaking at the same time implying, actually insisting that this boy was so grateful at what the old servant had done. I at once was disgusted and after throwing up I could not read that book anymore. I doubt that any normal parent or person would share this view at all. Bottom line it's a morally irresponsible book and it shows the state of our world that it's getting so many sales and critical acclaim. Sick minds all round."
1,Read another book instead,"I don't think I have ever read a book that had so many unpleasant characters. If this book paints an accurate picture of modern Egypt, I'm going to have to cross that country off my list of Places to See Before I Die."
5,a painful and honest view,The story is a wonderful painful and honest view of the todays egyptian society...where you can extend this view to other many arabic countries...it explains how and why the arab youth are feeling lost in their home countries...i recommend it for any one who is interested to see a real egyptian society ....
1,Ghost recon 2 is the worst game i ever played,this game is soooo bad. When i started this game it was okay but then i noticed that you could tell when the enemies coming because the screen would jump.i also found out your teamates are the worst shots ever. also the only weapon that actually works is the sniper rifle because with every other weapon youll die before you see the enemy which makes this game pretty hard.the reviewer who talked about pro gamers magazine review is a liar this game stinks
1,It Broke After 5 Months,"I bought this blender in Jan 08 and it worked really well until June 08. When I was making my morning protein shake, sparks literally started shooting out of the bottom of the blender and they went all over the kitchen counter.My only use for this blender was to make protein shakes of just milk, protein powder and cocoa. I never put in fruit or ice and I never let it run for more than 30 seconds at a clip. So to say I wore out the motor is bogus.I'm returning it to Amazon and getting 70% off of the total price back b/c I ordered the item in January. I don't want anything in my house that is a clear fire hazard.Bottom line, worked great for 5 months until it broke and this item is a fire hazard."
2,unsatisfactory performance,"blade is too small to blend large cup contents. I had used the same bland blender before. It was good, so that I purchased this updated model. blade design is clearly worse than it used to be."
1,poorly designed,".. this items was poorly designed. it barely chops or cuts anything due to the fact the blades are at least 1"" from the sides of the container so food items get lodged in the side area and do not get chopped. also it is quite loud and clunky as well as the 'on'- 'off' switch being difficult use. i would not recommend it."
4,Excellent blender for the $,"Works great for blending protein drinks. Have used it 2-4 times a day since I purchased. To bad it is NOT DISHWASHER SAFE. If it was I would have given it 5 stars. Be sure and read the instructions before operating. Pulse first as directed and do not run more then 90 seconds! Wife, let it run trying to pull frozen fruit from the top and cooked the motor. The second one has worked non-stop due to watching it while blending and not over taxing the motor."
3,Not as good,This is my second one of these but this one doesn't work as well. I use it for fruit smoothies and use a lot of frozen fruit and it doesn't blend it well. I'll keep using it though...like the blender container/cup being one.
2,If only it was dishwasher safe,"So far, I've used it twice and it's ok. Frozen fruit takes a lot to puree and there is always spilling when unscrewing the blade base from the cup. It's fairly easy to clean, but I really wish it was dishwasher safe so the blades got a better wash. Overall, I think I'll be taking this to use at work and getting a better product for my kitchen."
5,This set is great!,"This is one of the better Lego Star Wars sets. The TIE Fighter ( Darth Vader's, cool!) is very realistic except for the blue areas that should be gray. The Y-Wing, however, is better. It comes with a really nice Rebel pilot (not Luke!) and has lots of terrific details including a storage compartment and blaster cannon. The only thing wrong is that the cockpit is a little flat. Overall this set is great and I highly recommend it. P.S. I love the R5-D4!"
5,GOOD FUN AND GOOD SURF IN HAWAII,"These films are really fun to watch. Theres some cool interviews too. I really enjoyed the interview with Mark Richards and there is great footage of classic surf as well as some really wicked wipeouts. If you are a long boarder you'll enjoy TANKER RE-EVOLUTION, the third film on this disc and if you are a body boarder you will probably like I DON'T KNOW WHY the body boarding film. The music is very laid back and has the island feel but there are a few harder tracks. All Hawaiian footage. Pretty cool. Mahalo Dude!!"
4,Worthy of the money!,"I was skeptical when looking at this wireless microphone for such a low price and almost did not order it. After speaking with the business owner I decided to order it. When It arrived I was not dissapointed. It worked well with my camera. I use it with a Cannon FS200 recording videos for YouTube under the MentorDavidL Channel. It has made my editing and recording easier. I am not easy on the microphone as I film on location, while traveling and at other venues. I will be ordering another in the near future. To See this Microphone in action check out [...]"
4,Good deal,"You will not get the best quality microphone device, but it does work well for the price. The clip broke after using it for a day, but it was easy to adapt."
3,Good phone bad advertising,The phone is excellent so far. It was everything I thought it would be. What I didn't like is that it shows 3 phones in the ad but they only send you 2. To me this is false advertising. They should show actually what you would be getting.
2,Too little of an intro for 60$,"Why do so many authors of Arabic textbooks insist on confusing readers with their own idiosyncratic codes of Arabic transliteration when there's a standardized international code that most scholars and students of Arabic are well familiar with, and that is easy to learn for all others?But my major disappointment with the book is simply that there's too little content to justify either 250 pages or 60 dollars. It is a common enough, if annoying, tactic of authors to inflate a textbook's volume by filling page after page with ""exercises"" in the form of widely spaced, monotonous lists of near-identical alternating phrases, but al-Khalesi has carried it way too far. The vocabulary and dialogues are fresh and practical, but there's too little of either... on 250 pages, one would expect an author to be able to go deeper into the language than this."
1,not a solid saucepan,"This pan is very thin, smells tinny, the handle heats up quickly to a dangerous skin burning hot and is just a folded peice of metal so that the edges are sharp where the folds come together and the very tip is just a single layer of metal ( my cuisinart ss handles stay cool). The rivets inside the pot, that hold the handle on are rusted (arrived in this condition). I returned it and will go back to cuisinart. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find a double boiler in cuisinart in the 2 quart size but this one was not worth keeping."
5,Amazing!!!1,I saw this cd and had to have it. I have already listened to the entire track list and loved every minute of it! If you are a Callas fan this is a must have!!
4,It's a poncho,"It's a poncho, it protects when it rains. I have these in my emergency auto kits. Four more words, thanks."
5,"""Who'd be a woman?""","Landing on the Planet Telos, the Doctor, Jamie and Victoria run into an expedition searching for the last remains of the Cybermen. The Troughton classic is finally released on DVD, fully restored by the DWRT(Doctor Who Restoration Team), with loads of bonuses and extras. The story itself happens to be one of the BEST Cybermen serials. Although, there are some iffy accents, ridiculous dialogue and OTT acting, it's mainly a lot of fun. The enjoyment and fun level in this Who outing ranks among the best. It may not be for most of Today's Sci-Fi audience, but revelers' of B-movies and old TV programs will applaud.Not sure if I understand all that symbolic logic, though..."
5,Timeless Music,Deodato captures the era of the Sixties with this C.D. and it translates well to todays music. Great C.D.
5,awesome,A must for any punk fan... really hard to find because it is out of print since many years. one of my favorites cd.
1,not as pictured!,"Caution, this watch is not as it appears. There are diamondish blingish stones on either side by the band, not the subtle item pictured. If your're looking for flash, this is it!"
1,Below Standards,"My children love Dora, so I was sure this leapster game was a hit. We have several games, and they have loved them all. Neither one of my 3 or 5 year old will play the game. Don't waste your money on this game."
1,Trendy worthless crap,"There's a thousand other ""hardcore"" bands that sound similar if not exactly like this abomination. I don't care how talented and technical they are. They make lackluster music. They just hopped right on the trend train to emoville."
3,Better if you have your own horse....,I like the idea of connected riding but I found the exercises that you do at home a little too much. Those suggested for when your on the horse would work better if you can ride more than once a week in a lesson. I got the most out of the last couple of chapters and would have understood the whole principle if those were first instead of at the end.
4,"Well written, highly informative, and deeply poignant.","This book shows what light a man of God can bring to a darkened world. Warren La Coste's bare all book about his involvement with and influence on a New Orleans biker gang is truly inspirational and eye-opening. And while there are many Hanks, Freddies, and Cheryls of the world sadly enough there are many Bills and Mickey Manuel's too, but thank heavens for a person who reached out to this group by looking into their souls, instead of looking at them with disdain by looking at their appearance.This book was a real page turner and hard to put down. I would highly recommend this book for anyone, especially for the person who asks, ""What can one person do?"""
1,"Static, static, static!!!!!!","I received the Uniden 5.8 DXI5586-2 for Christmas-2005 and I must eagerly agree with the majority of reviews... ""The Uniden 5.8 DXI5586-2 has the worse interference I've ever encounter in a cordless system"". And forget the features if you can't have a decent conversation without unbearable ""STATIC"" and tried repeatedly to change the channel by pressing the select/channel key with ""NO"" luck... ""WHAT GOOD IS THIS PHONE AT ALL"" Good reception is the key word here which the Uniden 5.8 DXI5586-2 does NOT have if you purchase this cordless system."
4,Cordless Phone with Dual Handsets,"Work great, dual handset it somewhat difficult to transfer calls from one to the other.( Can not use both at the same time so two people can share a call)"
3,There are better phones out there,"The phone works well enough I suppose but I'm not happy with it. I bought it primarily because I needed a phone and this one was a great price but I'm wishing I had looked around more.I don't have the static problems mentioned but the one problem I do have is that when I am talking, the other person can barely hear me. Chances are, I will be replacing this as soon as possible.If you are considering this phone, I strongly urge you to look further before buying."
1,NOT recommended -STAY AWAY!,"I bought this unit (MOTU micro lite) to be able to easily do a Midi merge between devices, but there is no software available to map the midi ports or configure the device. It was a total waste of money for me and I give it zero (0) stars because when you read the description it gives you the impression that it does this easily. The product manual is ridiculous in that it covers 5 different MOTU products and most of the content doesn't apply to the micro lite. There is almost no specific content in the manual for the micro lite. I wrote to tech support and still have no response after a week. I don't understand how you can run a business this way. Highly disappointed and NOT recommended."
3,A good read,"I wouldn't say it's that great of a book, but it's imagery is great, and it seems to really lighten the load of death. I wasn't able to follow along with the story that well, it might take me a few more times reading it to get it down, so it was sort of a slow read.For a first book I thought it was good, and I didn't know she was 69 when she wrote this. My first impression was that she was 12, not as an insult, but that feeling came to mind while reading. This book reminded me of my youth youth because of its location, and that I respected the book for."
1,My humble opinion,"We just read this book for my honors english class. The book rambles on and trys to send a message, but never quite gets there. It's obvious that she also just wanted to end the book, as well. She kills off the main character in 2 sentences. But, then again, I'd want to stop writing that book, too. I wouldn't recomend this book. I usually do like symbolism books, but this one doesn't make any sence and runs around itself. Once again, I don't recoment this book."
1,AVOID THIS MESS AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!,"This could possibly be the worst book I've ever read. I had to read this for honors English class, and, oh my. I like reading usually, and I'm a fast reader, but...oh my. Took me forever. Avoid this mess. Unless you like droll books with no plot and action, no character develpment, and absolutely no life at all. Literally. Lots of people die. Its a terrible book, and at the risk of repeating myself...AVOID THIS MESS!!!!"
1,NO NO NO NO NO,"I am a student and I had to read this book. It gave me a different outlook on life. NOT TO READ ANYMORE. This book is both boring and confusing. You will all probably say that I am a nut, but this is the wierdest book with no ending I have ever read. Don't buy it. Wait till' your teacher forces you to read it!"
2,Not that good.,"Well ok. I DID like it the first few times I played it. But now I think it is one bad game. I had wanted it SO MUCH, but it is a total bust. I don't play it at all anymore. Instead I play my better games, Sonic Adventure, Sonic Shuffle, Bass Fishing, And Hydro Thunder. I'm also gonna get Power Stone 1 & 2, Marine Fishing, and Sonic Adventure 2. Of course it is an individual thing, so I am gonna let other people say it is good. I don't think people should cuss a game out. So I am saying that I don't like it in a Christ-like manner. It's boring."
1,Like watching a ping pong match,"I've never seen a book that bounced around with the story line so much. Murder, extortion, con men, dog psychics, car theft. 30% of the way through the book and I still wasn't sure what the story line was and by the end, wished I'd never invested the time in reading it. While the writing and editing is first rate, it has little to no excitement and is extremely hard to follow. Glad I got it while it was on the free list, would hate to have paid even a dollar for this. I guess fans of Ben Rehder expect and enjoy this kind of style based on the positive reviews here but there are much, much better writers out there who write about the exact some geographical location."
3,I think The Lucky Shopping Manual is Better,"I bought this book at the same time I bought THE LUCKY SHOPPING MANUAL. Though this book does has some strong points, I prefer the other book. The author does talk about varying body shapes and how to flatter and fit them in order to look your best. She includes a list of recommended fits, including types of shirts, pants (based on your shape), etc. This all occurs within the first 75 pages of the book. After that, I think she just begins to ramble on. She includes a list of designers to shop, many of which a young 20-something like me cannot afford. The website shops that she suggests are helpful - that is, if the link is still active - some of them are not. I'm much happier with the LUCKY book, which includes several lists of things to add to your wardrobe, etc."
4,A book to take along with you,"With her handy pocket, Kendall Farr offers a guide for women with self-confidence, who are practical and have no time for fuss. For the three body-silhouettes (the pear shape, the hourglass shape and the upside-down triangle) she sketches all ins and outs in writing and practical pictures. With a minimum of effort you get a maximum of information about what (not) to wear and how to create a style of your own. She also gives interesting advice for better fitting of ready-to-wear clothing and how to create a timeless yet modern presence. A book to take along with you (in the handbag that fits your silhouette best!)."
5,LOVED this book,"I finally have my eyes opened to what is going on in the fashion world. I learned I have a 'body type' and what looks good on it. I've purged my closet and could finally let go of items that 'weren't quite right' but I had always kept; now I know why they don't look good!I am going shopping this weekend armed with my Pocket Stylist and a measuring tape :) No more wasting time being frustrated in the dressing room! This book was a huge learning experience, was worth every penny."
1,THIS IS NOT A BOOK AND IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"Please beware that The Xena Scrolls is not a book, and it is not by Ru Emerson. It is a fold-out poster and is not worth the money. I only wish I had read the customer reviews before I made my purchase!"
2,Not Much Game for the Money,"Unless you're REALLY into tetris games, or you're going to use the xbox live free month in this game, then don't bother. The positive, it gives you an idea about what kind of stuff is available on xbox live. There are periodic deals on this game that, if you're going to cash in the xbox live coupon, will make it worth while. Do the math. If this costs anything near the cost of a month of xbox live, then go for it."
3,"Brash, Loud, Fast and Sleek","This U.K. foursome comes on like Wire fronted by The Fall's Mark E. Smith. Their debut, Chat and Business, is brash, loud, fast, and sleek. Decidedly post-punk, these twelve tracks are awash in angular rhythms and the usual youthful disaffection. Nothing wrong with that; in fact, it's part of rock and roll tradition. You can smell the desperation festering in ""Belgravia"". And the gritty disavowal of hundreds of years of European aristocracy in ""Sink Venice"" is a stroke. But after that it's down to a steely, brittle sound, the hectoring vocals of Paul Resende (admittedly sweetened when Claire Ingram chimes in behind him), and how familiar you are with the preferable works of Wire and/or The Fall at their peaks."
4,Grew on me,"I'm not a huge fan of the punk sound, but there are a few exceptions. Fugazi and The Fall are among the few bands I really really like that have a punk element to their sound (though I doubt either would be classified as ""punk"" per se). That said, I didn't expect to like this. At first listen, it came off as somewhat abrasive and atonal. I gave it a chance for a few days in my car stereo, and it grew to be one of my favorites from 2002. There's definitely a Fall influence in there, but it's original enough to go beyond sounding like Fall wannabe's. It's fun to yell along with!"
1,Poor acquisition....,"What a dispointment.. AFter reading all Pitt's adventures, I thought his writer would make a much better job when writing a kind of autobigraphical book. But the pattern chosen to tell his story is not good at all, is boring."
4,Review of Dirk Pitt Revealed,"This book is full of very interesting information about Clive, Dirk, and all the adventures they have shared with us throughout the years. It makes for very enjoyable reading."
3,Dirk Pitt Revealed: Why is this not in Audio book form?,Dirk Pitt Revealed: Why is this not in Audio book form? Just about everything else is. I would enjoy it more if it were unabridged audio cds
4,Great CD,"I loved dancing to these song when I was in greece, and listening to them brings back great memories from one of the best times in my life."
1,SUNPRO TACHOMETER,"The tachometer out of the box is light, simple to hook up, and looks like a high end professional tach. But, after wiring up the tach, the background light only worked for the first few hours. The tachometer needle sometimes jumps all the way past 10,000 rpm. Sometimes it doesn't work at all. Rechecked all wiring, and is hooked up correctly. I have this tach installed in my 2008 Kawasaki Teryx and its possible it cannot stand up to the pounding of off roading. I will end up purchasing a different tach."
5,Tastes good makes you feel great.,I started taking Lecithin Granules for my depression. It is amazing the difference in just a week. This in conjunction with Niacin is helping me to get off my depression medicine. and quick! Mega Doses of vitamins are a big key in that. The granules work better as they absorb in the body better then the pills and are more potent. I put this in my yogurt and it tastes good. it make things more of a gummy texture when you add it so just keep that in mind.
2,Extremely small,It says it's for 6 people but the grill is not enough for not even 2 people. It's as big as a dinner plate.Returned it before even using
3,Buy from someone else,"The grill is great and exactly what I wanted. But the company did not package the grill at all before mailing it. They just put the mailing address on the outside of the product box. The grill arrived with its box completely beat up. This was very frustrating because it was going to be a gift, and the box made it look like something I had dug out of my attic instead of buying new. I also had to open it to double check nothing was broken. I would recommend buying raclette grills, but not from this company."
2,"3 episodes, eh? LOL At least you won't be watching too long...2.3 stars.","...Cause this series is a terrible downer. The jokes are rarely funny and the show consists of shallowly-attractive celebrities who are rich somewhat spoiled and get their way nearly every time. None of them act that well, and London is the most spoiled, terrible actress that Disney has ever spat out at us. I totally despise her stupid, ditzy air-headed persona. It makes me sick, how stupid she has to act to get 10 year olds to laugh.I didn't like the program when it first arrived on the Disney Channel over two and a half years ago, and I grew to loathe it, episode after episode after episode.Watch Lizzy McGuire, Kim Possible, That's So Raven, or The Proud Family; they're much better, well-rounded Disney programs.Cover Art: CDialogue: D+Characters: C+Length: C-Overall: D+2.3 stars."
3,I got what I paid for,I got this because me and my kids enjoy watching this show. I was disappointed that there were only 3 episodes on here but we still enjoyed watching it.
3,"Bland, really, really, really bland","WARNING: Review by a person who is fussy about the food she put in her body. If something tastes ""off,"" even a little, I just won't eat it. My family feels exactly the same way.That being said, no one in my household will be eating these. They were not bad or tainted in any way, but the candy was like mildly sweet, nearly tasteless rubber. There isn't a whole lot more to say about it. Maybe whoever was supposed to add strawberry flavor to this batch of candy may have been out sick that day."
3,Not very strong/damaged,"I was disappointed side and corner cracked/broken during shipping although seemed to be packaged well. Don't want to go through hassle cost etc to send back. Size was described as 54x37 I would say more like 52x&34.5. I was hoping it would be the size as described. I am using it under cat liter boxes in a closet to protect wood floor so I guess it will do, but disappointed."
4,A Great Tale of Good and Evil,"This is an awesome story for a new writer. The tale will carry you along as you turn the pages. A group of people get a vision from a little boy, Timmy. Timmy is trapped in hell which he calls the ""Forever House."" He calls out to people to come and save him from his fate. His fate is their fate. His father tortures him daily, keeps him in a room which is the ""Forever"" place. He likes to sing a song his mother used to sing to him, ""I'm a little teapot, short and stout..."" Timmy couldn't save his mother and now he needs someone to save him from himself. As Timmy suffers, the strangers move in to help him. They all have other agendas however, so it gets interesting.L.D. Williams does a good job with his characters. His atmosphere is well done. You feel as if you are there with them.I highly recommend this book."
3,"enjoyable, sweet and sad","this dvd should be seen by any john lennon fan, but if u are yoko-hater stay away!"
1,Appalling Grab for John's Fame,"With everything I've read about John Lennon, I'm relatively sure he would've divorced Yoko had he lived another year or two. He was cleaning himself up and trying to get his career back on track.I spotted the first post-John revisions with Yoko's TV movie about their ""love story"" some years ago: in the final moment before the ""killer nerd"" strikes, John is shown entering the Dakota with Yoko on his arm.That's not how it happened. John was alone walking in.Now this DVD. When I'd heard that Yoko had John's lover Mai Pang removed and REPLACED with footage of her, I was appalled. Did she think no one would notice? Does she care?Or does she believe that we'll all die off and her scary possession of the Lennon legend will prevail?Truly sad and demented."
3,Lennon's music videos,"I thought these were going to be music videos, like what you see on MTV. A few were but most of them were like watching home movies, family snapshots, etc, with the music as a background. After a few videos, you notice the same snapshots, clips of the same home movies, not what I expected."
4,Some more ersatz observations,"...To add to all the remarks about overdubs and so on, I notice the grain on the headstock of the 1958 325 Rickenbacker does not match that shown in Andy Babiuk's ""Beatles Gear"". Since the one in ""Beatles Gear"" has the serial number V81, I believe Andy's photo shows the original guitar. I suspect these are just props for the video.Putting Epstein in the ""Mama"" video is, I think, cheeky and hints at Yoko's beliefs regarding their relationship.But even so, on the one hand I really enjoy this set of videos, but I agree with everyone it's ""Ono, too much Yoko"", so a grain of salt is required when one feels the heart strings being tugged during scenes of the happy couple."
5,Amazing!,I live in Atlanta and have had the pleasure of seeing this girl LIVE! She is an amazing singer and artist. Keep up the great work Crea.
1,Don't get confused!,"One should assume that the name Crea is sufficiently rare. But Amazon.com offers exactly two CDs by singers of that name who have obiously no relation at all. If you like the CD ""Country Classics"" (like I do), you must be disappointed by ""Mystory"". It is a completely different style. The (sometimes misleading) entries in the ""Browse for music"" section mentioning ""R&B"" seem to be correct (but I am way from being an expert in that style). Unfortunately one cannot listen to samples here at Amazon, but these are available elsewhere on the web. Too bad that it also takes a closer look at the cover scan to see that this singer's ethnicity is not exactly typical for country music."
5,Grand Duos by Schubert and Loewe,Two pianos playing with unbelievable facility and feeling. I can listen to it over and over.
5,The Nobody is appealing to all readers;highly theatrical,"""The Nobody"" is that rare thing - a genre book whose appeal goes beyond its fans. The author has a very theatrical way with dialogue, resulting in characters who are charming and witty. It bridges the very tricky gap between realistic historical detail and current sensibilities. If the regency genre is to have a future, Ms Farr is in the vanguard."
3,Disappointment,"I bought it for my 14 yr. old grandson, only to find out that he was giving up baseball to concentrate on basketball - a very sad day in the life of his baseball-loving grandfather. Maybe I'll have to find a book, ""How to Shoot Like a Pro"". (:>("
1,Comic Book,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !This book should be described as a Comic Book.It is written by: Eddie The Wire (Aparently NOT a Locksmith)Illistrated By: Kevin Martin (A Rejected Cartoonist)Not a good Locksmith and also a very poor excuse for a writer !You will be lucky if you are able to make one useful tool from this book that will work.You will need to buy more tools and supplies to make the tools then it would cost to purchase professionally made tools from the start !
4,Enjoyable reading; great to read aloud to your husband,"I enjoyed the stories in Chicken Soup for the Father's Soul. Some make you laugh and some come pretty close to making you cry. I bought the book because I enjoy reading out loud to my husband and though it's not a book he would buy for himself, I thought it was one he would like. He did. If you are looking for a ""feel good"" book for the dad in your life, you can't go wrong with this book. Another great book for dads is 15 Reasons I Love My Dad. It's a fill-in-the-blank book that you fill with loving words and pictures. With Father's Day just around the corner, both of these books are guaranteed to please."
5,A Great Father's Day Gift!,"I bought this book for my father for Father's day. Being an avid Chicken Soup for the Soul reader, I was curious to see how this book compared to the other books in the series. After I started reading some of the stories in the first chapter, I couldn't put the book down! I ended up reading the whole book in two days. I found the stories to be inspirational, humorous and heartwarming. I know my father will love this book. I've decided to buy my grandfather and father-in-law a copy for Father's day too. I would definitely recommed buying this book."
1,leapster A/C adapter,we love having the option to plug our daughters leapster in. This way when we are at home we can plug it in and it doesn't eat through the batteries as much!
5,Very handy!,I love having this around for if the batteries run dead and I don't have any others charged up at the moment.....my son can continue playing with it plugged in.
1,doesnt fit our plug system,i didnt remember about plugs here in Australia thought it would be helpful when batteries are charging but it is useless
4,A/C LEAP PAD ADAPTER REVIEW,"The adapter to a Leap Pad works great, especially when you think what the cost of 4 batteries cost every week or more depending on how often your child plays. The only down fall is that you need to be near an outlet, but the batteries work when you are not. So it is worth buying. Was shipped in okay time frame. It did come in its time frame."
1,No Good,Received the product rather timely. However i was very much disappointed when i plugged it in my son's leappad and nothing happened. It showed absolutely no signs that it was sending power to the leap pad. I found this out maybe a week after i bought it so i knew i would be given hell if i tried returning it since the maximum days for returns had passed. My 3yr old and i were extremely disappointed.
4,Good music collection,"Love the music, love the show. The show has a great soundtrack, and it was great getting the music in one big collection."
3,Missed the mark,"I am one of the biggest fans of the Rescue Me series. The problem is that this soundtrack cd left out many of the great songs. I too have kept a log of songs from all the various episodes. At the present time, I have 27 songs in that list and it is incomplete. So how can a single-disc soundtrack encompass enough of the songs and bear the label of ""Rescue Me Soundtrack."" My advice for anyone who likes the music on this show is to go on iTunes (this is what I use) or some other site, buy the songs, download them and then make your own cd or make a playlist like me on your mp3 player of choice."
3,Doesn't rock,"Outside of the main title (C'mon, C'mon), this CD is nothing but slow whiny depressing stuff. Was expecting a little more aggressive music. Oh, well, guess that's why IPODs sell great."
4,it should be made as an essential to all children,"easy to understand and with full details for us to know the lives of the beloved march sisters & their boys & girls, esp, my dearest mother jo"
2,GOOD START THEN GOES OFF THE RAILS....,"I WAS INTRIGUED BY THE CONCEPT OF A SON OFF TO FIND HIS LOST FATHER. STARTS OFF WELL. OF INTEREST WAS THE LOCATION OF THE SAHARA FOR THE SEARCH. WHEN THE FIRST DREAM EPISODE CAME ALONG AND WENT ON AND ON I DECIDED TO SKIM TO THE NEXT CHAPTER. IT WAS ALL DOWNHILL FROM THERE. WAY TOO MUCH MENTAL ILLNESS. THE FAMILY LINE HAD PROMISE BUT THE AUTHOR SLUMPED INTO CRAZY MODE AND THE STORY BECAME TEDIOUS. EVEN AS A CHILD OF THE SIXTIES AND A FAN OF FANTASY, I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE IN NEED OF AN EDITOR WITH A STRONG HAND. DISAPPOINTING MIDDLE AND POINTLESS ENDING TO WHAT STARTED OUT WITH THE PROMISE OF A GOOD READ."
3,Save your money,This filter is nice but you do not need to change the cap with the filter so save you$$$$ and just buy the filter.
4,Karen sounds beautiful!,"I agree with the last reviewer.""A kind of hush"" is a great CD.Karen's voice sounds so sweet and pretty.My favorite songs on here are:""Can't smile without you"",""sandy"",""I need to be in love"" and ""I have you"". I don't understand why this CD is so underrated."
3,A better than good album by the Carpenters,"A Kind Of Hush is a better than good album. Richard Carpenter has stated that he felt Horizon had a drag to it (which is not true. Horizon is the Carpenters' best album) but he continued to state that he felt A Kind Of Hush is inferior to Horizon. Regardless that A Kind Of Hush isn't the best Carpenters album it is still well worth purchasing. It has a few excellent songs. Including the experimental Boat To Sail, a great recording of Can't Smile Without You and the beautiful One More Time. Karen's voice shines as she brings each song on this album to life."
5,One of Lamm's best!,"My favorite Lamm solo record. While Chicago sat around and released greatest hits garbage for over a decade, Robert was busy releasing several solo albums, all good in different ways, but this was one of the best. Your my Sunshine sounds like it was intended for a future Chicago release...sounds like signiture Chicago. I really like the mix of jazzy sounds and some songs that are a little more rock, but not too heavy."
2,Harlequin Romance Fans Will Love It!,"I usually avoid Harlequin Romances and other series books, like the plague. I was in the mood for a vampire story and noticed that Love Bites by Margaret St. George (a.k.a. Maggie Osborne) was highly rated by a popular romance magazine. I will say it's the best vampire story I've ever read. However, I found the ending realistic and not very satisfying; and the story is told in typical Harlequin 'quickie' fashion. It was ok but nothing to really brag about."
3,Step On,"Perhaps one of the most obscure CDs ever made is John Kongos' Tokoloshe Man. I was made aware of John Kongos through a reflective little song called ""I Wish I Was Five"" by the group Scrugg (found on the Pye Paisley Pop collection).Little did I know what a monster jam ""He's Gonna Step On You Again"" was going to be. It's amazing the way the downbeat becomes the upbeat on the choruses and somehow comes back together when the verse returns. This song alone is worth the cost of this CD. It sounds alot like Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac circa 1970.The title track is very similar but not as memorable. The rest of the songs are typical of the period and wouldn't sound out of place on an Argent or Badfinger LP.[DW]"
1,HOW DARE MS HOOPER STEAL THIS TITLE FROM MARK REED'S NOVEL!!,"HOW DARE MS HOOPER THINK SHE CAN GET AWAY WITH STEALING THIS TITLE FROM MARK REED'S NEW BRITISH SUSPENSE THRILLER, 'SOMETHING DIFFERENT!!!'"
2,Snake Glue Trap,Snake Glue Trap delived in excellent condition. Snake Glue Trap did not catch even one of my many snakes in my outbuilding. Would not recommend and would not purchase again.
5,Put This In Your Stocking for Christmas!l,"This CD is jam-packed with so many gorgeous arrangements of traditional carols that it will appeal to all who listen. The Burt Carols are fresh and sung in the original style: a cappella! The fact that the composer's daughter is one of the members makes these close harmony arrangements even more special, especially for such a small group of singers. I highly recommend this recording for everyone, especially fans of the Burt Carols! Wait til you hear their rendition of Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas and Silent Night. It will give you goosebumps."
1,"I love the music, but hate this performance","I've been a fan of the Burt carols for years, so when I saw this recording, I ordered it immediately. Boy was I disappointed. The performance is in tune and the ensemble is rhythmically tight. However, the music is so stiff that I can't stand to listen to it. This is one of the most unmusical performances of the Burt Carols I have ever heard. The original 1954 Columbia recording has slow tempos, but still more musical. The best recording I have found remains the one with orchestrations added by Lex de Azevedo (album is called CAROLING, CAROLING and published by DeseretBook). His CD keeps the original carols and just adds some great orchestrations."
4,the new Clem Snide EP,"'Beautiful' is a new EP of Clem Snide favorites. Since there's no track listings posted thus far, here goes:-the band's version of Christina Aguilera's ""Beautiful""-a live cover of the the Velvet Underground classic ""I'll Be Your Mirror"" (recorded live at WFUV)-the 'Soft Spot' single ""All Green""-the Clem Snide classic ""Nick Drake Tape"", also recorded live at WFUV-the previously unreleased track ""Mike Kalinsky.""It's not a good introduction to the band, but it's a must-have for fans."
2,Too Simple,"I wanted to like this book, but I just could not. It was a speed read because it lacked depth. The author tried to cover too many topics without providing adequate explanation for any. For basic home repair, Home Depot has several books that provide much better explanation and clear pictures. For self-help, there are thousands of better choices. While I applaud Barbara K's efforts to create a lifestyle niche for herself, I think the field may already be too crowded. I'm sorry I spent the money. I donated the book already in the hopes that maybe someone else will find some value and that my Amazon dollars did not go to waste."
2,This is terrible,Not even worth the $.99 I paid for it. Really bad. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star was because I didn't find any spelling errors in the first 20 pages. Very poorly written with cardboard cut out characters in ridiculous situations.
1,So Disappointed,"I wanted to like this SO MUCH.The sample sold me on this one but pretty soon after it took a nosedive and never recovered. I agree with other reviewers who said the writing was weak and shallow, the characters flat, often incomprehensible. Things seemed to happen because the author wanted them to, not because they were logical. I loved the premise, even after I got fed up with this I still skimmed for a while because I really wanted to follow this story. But it became too frustrating to even keep up with that. I wish I'd paid more attention to the negative reviews and not been fooled by the number of 4 & 5 stars. (??)"
4,"Good, fun read.","Good characters, good action, great hero, finished the book in a day and was really sorry the second book wasn't already available. Will read more."
1,Horrific,"Look, if your favorite novel by your favorite author can be compared to fine dining at a five star restauraunt, this book would be analogous to that months-old stale french fry you found under your car seat. Even at $0.99 the price is too high. As another reviewer said, the target audience must be pre-teens. Very bad writing, pacing is awful, flat characters, obvious plot, stale and superficial."
2,Cheesy and predictible,Review title says it all. If you are over puberty do not bother to read. Characters are so flat they are cardboard. Reminiscent of a cheap fantasy script for TV. Good basis of magic theory but the magic is never explained. Perhaps author has not figured it out yet. How this book received such high ratings from others is simply beyond comprehension. One good thing is there is never a word I need to look up. Most are under 2 syllables.
2,not enough for really cold weather,"we tried using this pad in a dog crate inside an unheated garage, on a day when it was about 15-20 F. Our healthy 70-lb Lab (used to being outside) was shivering when we got home. Might work better in a small or very enclosed space.Pad is rigid and inflexible, so make sure you can get it into the kennel!"
5,music for your soul,"I love this band. The CD is full of wonderful melodies and the texts are great. I'm sorry for all the people who cannot understand what ""patent ochsner"" sings; it's all very poetic. I love ""sunnechunig"" (which means ""sunking"") and ""w.nuss vo bÃ¼mplitz"". But I'd say nearly every song is absolutely great!! As more as you listen to this CD the more you'll like it!!"
5,Excellent Book,This book was purchased as a gift. It was in excellent condition and was received in plenty of time. This is an excellent book for inspiration regarding success.
4,well worth it,"A classic read for those that have followed ND football to any extent. Any football fan would enjoy. Some great life lessons as well, reminded me slightly of some of Wooden's books."
5,Surprisingly Really Entertaining,"Just to start off I'm a huge fan of Asian horror movies and the horror movie genre in general. I also really liked Paranormal Activity 1 and 2, and Paranormal Entity. At first glancing at the cover of this movie I thought it looked pretty stupid, but I was excited to see another take on the whole haunted house documentary movie genre. So I rented the movie from amazon and surprisingly really liked it.The plot is actually fairly original in regards to its differences from the other ""paranormal"" movies that have been out lately. It's a different movie with the same idea of being a documentary. If you really enjoyed paranormal activity 1 and 2, and entity, you will probably like this movie. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie, I would definitely recommend it to fans of the genre."
2,"COMPLETO LA TRILOGIA..ABRE, REY SOL Y NATURALEZA SANGRE....","Sin duda este disco esta entre los mas flojos de fito, pero por lo menos de la ultima trilogia que lanzo(rey soy, abre y naturaleza sangre) este es el menos feo de los 3...hace mucho que fito no pega una, desde ""el amor despues del amor"" fito no ha hace un buen album. canciones sin ritmo y bastantes aburridas. lo unico rescatable de este disco es ""bello abril"" que es cantada con el flaco spinetta,""nuevo"" y ""salir el sol"" el resto es mas de lo mismo, incluyendo la cancion que canta con charly que tambien esta para el tacho de la basura. esperemos que fito se anime a sacar alguna joyita pronto. creo que todo somos conciente de lo genio que es fito asi que esperemos que pronto nos sorprenda."
4,STRONG,A strong scent that does not need to be reapplied.Long lasting with consistent positive responses.
1,Before You Say I Do,"The DVD came with a torn wrapper and opened. Not sure, but because I paid a small amount and almost as much for the S&H, I kept it and will donate the movie, as I found I already had 2 others."
2,scattered - evasive - deceptive - misleading,"The book skims over various aspects of drawing, never focusing on anything in parlticular, never dealing with any subcategory (animals, portrait, media, black and white or color).Everything is mixed up. This is another of those books where the author tried to do everything at the same time in one volume, but in so doing never dealt with anything very clearly.It lacks organization, definitely not a learning tool, but rather a rambling on a mish mash of unrelated examples.The title is very very misleading:The ART of the Pencil: that is not what Wallerstein discusses at all.A REVOLUTIONARY Look at Drawing, Painting, etc: there's ABSOLUTELY nothing revolutionary in this approach, believe me.I really regret having bought that book.The 2 * go to the drawings, not to the writing."
5,Awesome shirt and writing apparel,"I'm wearing this awesome shirt - it's totally comfortable, gorgeous Swan Song logo design, and from their 1973 concert tour - which is one of my favorites from their performance in Madison Square Garden. (Get the LED ZEPPELIN DVD to see amazing concert footage!)I'm bringing through a new book, and love wearing this t-shirt from the musicians who inspire me more than any other. The shirt would make a great gift for any Zeppelin fan - it's excellent quality!"
3,Not as good as the first set.,"This may not matter to alot of people,but I was really bummed after buying this set and discovering no Muppet Morsels(the pop-up facts about the show and the guest stars)like they had on the first set.When I buy classic movies and shows I really enjoy learning little things about them that I may not have known before.Most sets like this have a commentary track or something,this has nothing like that,and after having it on the first set I feel like I'm getting less for my money.If you don't care about things like that,and just want the episodes then it's a good set,but I was a little disappointed."
4,Great to have on DVD but extras aren't as good,"My family loved the season 1 set. We particularly loved the option of turning on what amounts to the ""pop up video"" from MTV. Production notes, little quirks, etc. would popup and give you more background about the filming of the episode. We were very disappointed that that wasn't continued for Season 2. My older children were as disappointed as their parents.However, if you loved the Muppet Show in it's original run, there's no doubt you'll love it again. Your kids will too. Pigs In Space is now a staple of the show and Beaker is introduced this season. Great fun for everyone!"
3,Works OK,"Slightly flimsy, absolutely must (like another reviewer said) cut potato ends and bottom side that slides against this cutter otherwise it will not work!"
2,French Frin Legion,Everythin was a goin swell until a spud kinda went a little sideways and the small cutter came apart never to cut again.. Cannot figure out how to replace it.. The kids like the smaller fries to the larger ones... So what is a guy to do? There has to be someone out there that can help me!!!!!
2,could be better,This product is one that for the money is ok but not very durable. The third potatoe I put through took out one of the blades of the cutter. My son was going to help me clean it and dropped the blade in the sink and the plastice border holding the blades in place cracked. Nothing some super glue didn't fix. I would not suggest this item if it will be used more than about once a month. Not strong enough for more than that.
3,"It worked, for a little while.","I've tried soaking the potatoes in water, but the big potato cutter already had it's blades literally bend and shoot out, which could've cut my finger off! The little one is much stronger, but I nearly destroyed the plastic frame...This is poor quality here, the blades aren't that sharp and the metal is thinner than a razors.I feel ripped off, if it wasn't for the low price, but still..."
1,Broke the 2nd time it was used,"I read both good and bad reviews here on Amazon about this product so I decided to give it a shot. What a waste of my time and money. The arms are made of very flimsy materials and by the 2nd time I used it both arms had bent, pulling the sliders out of their grooves and making the unit useless. I have my doubts that this could even cut through mashed potatoes. It certainly can not cut any raw potatoes."
