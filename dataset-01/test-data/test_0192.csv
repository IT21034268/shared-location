2,"Disappointing and depressing,","I bought this book full of high expectations. It is well written (which is why I gave it two stars) and imaginative, way too imaginative. The characters and situations are grotesque. It is impossible to identify with any of them. They are unlikable, self-centered and weird. Passages apparently intended to be funny approach slapstick; in fact, just about every situation and character is cartoon-like. If you like to see an author show off his clever way with words, you'll enjoy this book; otherwise, forget it."
1,BookLover,"I thought this book had potential at first because some of his writing is very intelligent. Other than hitting dead-on areas of real life that most avoid mentioning, it was boring and pointless."
1,Why should we care?,"This book was a great disappointment. Franzen is contemptuous of his characters, so why should his readers care about them? His critique of the middle-class Midwesterner is cliche and has been for decades. Don't waste your money or time."
3,Ho Hum till the end....not bad for a long car ride,"This book did not really capture my attention until the last CD. There were 8 altogether. I listened to it driving from NH to NJ and back again. The characters especially the secondary ones, could have used a little more depth.I am glad I had to listen to it, because if it had been the book, I would have put it down after the first 100 pages.Not all it was hyped to be."
1,Don't waste your time,This books was hyped beyond belief...it is long and boring and has no point...what a waste of time...will never read this author again.
3,Not my mother!,"This is the second book I have read that makes the mother seem stupid. Enid is not stupid, but I agree the ""queen"" of denial. If just once Alfred let her have her way she may not have hounded him so. Alfred sure knows how to keep secrets, too bad he is so ill, and that Gary is in the first stages of that illness. Man is his wife onery. I really liked Denise and Chip. If they had not been in the book I would have dumped it.As to the author's snobbery, I guess he must be Gary in the book, because that is exactly what Gary would have done. I have only read three other Oprah's choices and thoes were well written.The book this reminds me of is ""Walking Across Egypt"" by Clyde Edgerton."
2,This was a first .....didn't even finish .....lost interest,"I kept on reading, hoping the story would go somewhere, sadly it didn't. This is the first Oprah Pick that I put down.Anyone want to read it ??? You can have my copy."
1,Disfunction at its best,"This book was the ultimate in disfunction! I was completely depressed from the constantly moving fog of depression that clouded each family member every day. The writing is done well enough, but it is a story over-reaching in its climb down into the depths of complex sordid detailed disfunction."
2,Dysfunctional Families are Boring,I found the book to be a chore to read. The characters and the story were simply boring.
1,Exhausting,"Ugh- I tried, REALLY tried to like this book but it was exhausting. I felt like I was reading a literature grad student's first effort to get published. There were so many obtuse, ham handed deliveries of literary techniques that I literally had to set the book down and take a few deep breaths before I could go on. An exercise in tedium...."
5,Dazzling and Brilliant,Simply the best work of prose fiction in the past twenty years.(Matched only by JIMMY CORRIGAN... which is sort of a prose/poetry/art fiction-thing and you can't really compare the two...)Other reviews will tell you about characters or plot. I don't like to give those things away but will tell you this. There is something for everyone in here. There will be a character you will identify with and you will have empathy for all the other characters. This is the sort of fiction you wish would go on for two or three thousand pages. It's that good. Why say more? Your time will be better spent going to the bookstore right now and starting to read.
2,Wanted: An Editor With A Red Pen,"I just finished Mr. Franzen's laborious novel which took me 6 weeks to complete. Why so long one might ask? Well this verbose long winded work is not exactly a page turner. Mr Franzen is obviously well versed in character development. Unfortunately, there really is no story here. I pushed myself through the book to see how the monumental Christmas dinner would pan out. This dinner you see is the crux of the book. A whole lot of hoopla and no payoff. This last sentence sums up everything."
1,What was Oprah thinking?,"Oprah said this book was on the ""A"" list. Yes, I kept reading it to the end in order to find something of value, that surely must have been hidden in the early part of the book. Instead, I struggled through - looking for ""the point"" up to the very last page. There wasn't one character that I would go to dinner with, or spend any time with. Nobody that was interesting, cared about the human condition. What a mess of characters. And, the story as outlined on the jacket cover, was really nothing at the end. A total waste of time."
1,Drab and Dreary,"This book was not one of my favorites. There was not one character in this book that I liked or could identify with. They were all so depressing, and in my opionin, this book brought nothing to the table. I found the text to be very wordy and overly descriptive in many areas. I began to really dislike the characters. The only reason I tortured myself and finished the book was because it was for a bookclub."
1,Not High Art,"Since Jonathan Franzen has crowned himself the contemporary writer of ""High Art"" I expected to read the work of a newfound genius. If you must indulge your curiosity don't waste your money, borrow it from a library. He's just another arrogant American baby boomer who thinks too much of himself and his writing."
4,"Overstuffed, but enjoyable","While I think this story could benefit from a paring, I enjoyed the development of characters. There were interior ""dialogues"" that went on too long to be believed (and fractured the pacing). There are unnecessary or overdone sideplots (the personality changing device). But the story and characters are ultimately compelling. The style of writing is very Tom Wolfe-ish, though I don't consider Franzen Wolfe's equal in pacing and satire. Perhaps Wolfe's journalistic background makes him a more disciplined editor."
2,Too depressing to be good,"I really don't mind depressing per se. However, there has to be some redeeming value to the story to make it worth the effort of slogging through. I do not want to be left, as I was with this book, with the feeling that it's all pointless. That everything [stinks] and there's no point in trying, because it's all meaningless anyway. It is well-written, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one, but certainly not worth all the buzz that it has received."
3,Depressing commentary on modern life,"There is nothing to like about any one of the characters in the book. All are dispicable, self-involved, lost souls. It was well written and entertaining, but left a bad taste in your mouth. If this is a portrait of contemporary American society, we're all in trouble."
2,DeLillo has no cause to worry.,"This book has sweep, it has ideas, it has social commentary. But its style is tedious and trivializes everything. The sentences go clunkety-clunk. They are f-l-a-t. Sentences are crammed with predictable details. This is journalism and sociology trying to pass themselves off as literature. It's not working."
3,Mighty Fancy Writin',"This is mighty fancy writin'. Unfortunately, Franzen's cleverness and conspicuous command of language call attention to themselves and stand between the reader and the story. The characters and events range from patently contrived to somewhat less than credible, the varieties you'd expect in a pretty good Hollywood comedy. Nonetheless, Franzen IS clever and the book, like a pretty good Hollywood comedy, is entertaining."
1,Tedious at best!,"After reading the NY Times Book Review and seeing an interview on television with the author, I couldn't wait to buy this book. I can't remember the last time I was as let down by a novel as I was by this one. I eagerly read and read, waiting for the story line or the characters to become more interesting, and finally a friend told me not to bother. I just couldn't get through it.Oprah, what were you thinking ?"
1,Extremely Disappointed,"After all the hype about this book, and the fact that it won the National Book Award, I expected to read a good book, at the very least. Instead, I found shallow, predictable characters, and mediocre writing. I tried to finish the book (having paid hardcover price for it), but three-quarters of the way through, I slammed it shut in disgust - disgust at the hype, disgust at the National Book Award committee, disgust at the author for wasting my time. Lines in the book like: ""He hugged Denise and she lingered in his arms. She gave him a little bit of what men liked,"" would have sent me off into hysterical laughter - if I didn't feel so stupid for buying the book in the first place."
3,"overworked, overrevised, overdoctored novellas","Franzen bleeds his intestines in the first chapter -there are a million taps of a goldsmith (Look Mamma...); then settles up an OK pace: interesting characters (!!!) rumble through steely grooved narrative. He is supposed to be in the same gang as Pynchon/Delillo/Gaddis polarized (Foster Wallace gives a quote)and if he set out to produce an alternative to their form, he has merely succeded in writing a glorified mass market novel which will make people who otherwise could never digest tougher works, feel a bit more intellectually attuned but wouldn't jack up their general awareness."
1,Couldn't finish it,"Well written for sure. Didn't like the charactors, except for the youngest son. Just didn't want to read about these people and their misery for another 300 pages."
1,"Gibberish, Not Storytelling","Why are people falling all over themselves to praise this book? It's confusing and boring and about as indecipherable as Ancient Greek. I guess that's what makes THE CORRECTIONS a ""literary"" novel instead of just an entertaining story. Oh, stupid me! I'm don't understand the ramblings of Jonathan Franzen--(...). This book stinks, and excuse me, life is too short to waste even an hour of it trying to analyze this mess of words. If you want to read something literary AND understandable, read Richard Yates!"
1,"If more books were like this, I'd give up reading!!","I only read this book because my book club had selected it.Usually I can find something of worth in even very ordinary books, and browsing Amazon is like a Christmas-tree paradise to me with all the stuff I have read and want to read. Not this book! The author's puerile, contemptuous, shallow, show-off writing had less to offer than 99.9% of books. It was a real struggle to read. (6 of the 7 book-group members agreed, incidentally -- the other really enjoyed it.)Save your time and money for the wonderful alternatives available. If I lived a thousand years, life would still be too short to waste time on this book."
1,Suffered through it,Tragically hip and depressing. I kept reading because everyone is making such a fuss over this book. Am I missing something? The only good thing I can say about this book is that it ended.
2,"Average book, arrogant author","This is a decent read if a little long and sometimes tedious and often grim. But this guy's books should be boycotted ! He's so arrogant that he argues that he is ""high"" art as opposed to popular art and was horrified to be an Oprah book. He thinks that men may be put off by that (presumably being all too sophisticated even to think about watching Oprah--sports being so high brow!) I'm male and offended on my behalf and on behalf of my girlfriend, who' certainly bright enough to ""understand"" the big messages Franzen has to offer. And they're the same old messages--American materialism, family alienation, the nobleness of the greatest generation. I say (...) pick up something much better (... and) buy something wonderful by Eudora Welty."
1,I'd rather read my old college chemistry book.,"I am really disappointed to have to say this, but I've spoken with several people who have agreed that The Corrections was the most difficult book to get through...mainly because it is just plain boring.Some of the characters were interesting in their dysfunction, but the effort that was put into reading this novel would have been better spent earning my Ph.D."
1,"A loathsome, boring book","I'm sorry I didn't put it down, but persisted because of my book club. Speaking as a professional writer, I found it poorly written, with a self-important choice of words designed only to impress poor readers with hundred dollar words. It's a totally depressing, boring read that drones on forever. There's not an admirable, likeable character in the entire, full of unlikely scenarios. It's a totally loathesome book with no redeeming features and definitely unworthy of any praise or awards heaped upon it. If you don't like immersing yourself in dysfunctional families' neuroses, don't waste your time or money. I won't read any more of his works."
1,Corrections,"I don't know...I can only guess that Oprah must have forgotten to put on her reading glasses when she reads books written by this author......he just rambles on and on has the longest sentences in the history of books.....sooooo boring....no, I could NOT get past page 30....waste of time....yuk...wish I could return both this and his new one....I can't even remember the title, it was also so mundane...read to page 40 and it could not hold my interest at all..I read about 150-200 books a year, these are not 2 of them !!!"
1,Unknown,"I could not get into this book, no matter how many good rants and raves the author received about how good it was, I couldn't get lost in it. I finally quit trying."
1,Pathetic self-intersted tripe,I read to page 240 waiting for something to happen or for me to meet an interesting character that I cared about. Didn't happen. I put it down unfinished.
2,"Strained, false-note sitcom","Leery of an Oprah-recommended book, I read the first chapter at a friend's and was nevertheless impressed.Alas. By chapter 2 the false notes began to accumulate at breakneck speed. We are told that the protagonist, Chip, works part-time at proofreading but can somehow afford a doorman building in New York City--in the East Village, where there are few--if any!--doorman buildings. And that this doorman, named Zoroaster, is supposedly savvy enough to call out to Chip as he leaves, ""Goodbye, Mr. Chip!"" Chip's parents are presented as midwestern WASPs but read as quintessentially, transparently Jewish. In this desperately overwritten tome, Franzen frantically wants to entertain but can't decide if he's William Gaddis or Woody Allen. Obviously he's neither. The National Book Award has seen far better days."
1,"Like all the other ""Oprah"" boooks","Many of my friends groaned when I told them that I had bought the new ""Oprah"" book. They all said that the books she picks are too depressing. I ignored them, much to my own peril. About 60 pages into the book, I have put it down and do not even want to go on. Even if a book is marginally good, I will read it to the end to see how it works out, but with this book, I don't even care. Every single character is a mess of a person. That wouldn't even be so bad, but the writing is awkward. I counted a sentence that ran for 1/2 the page. That is not an anomaly. Many of the sentences are stream-of-consciousness and I wind up having to reread the beginning of the sentence to refresh my memory of what it was about.I was hoping that I could relate to the characters since I come from a family that gets together at Christmas. But I don't even like the characters enough to find out what happens to them."
3,Needs a good editor,"Great writing, granted, and some wonderfully acidic observations about the human condition and globalisation. But I couldn't help but get the feeling he went overboard on the wordage. The power of the central story was diluted by unnecessary digressions into the lives of secondary characters (eg: Robin Passafaro, Sylvia Roth). The whole Denise section was excessively long and didn't ring true in any case. The Chip and Gary sections seemed far more authentic. My feeling is that Franzen has written three or four books in one and tried to sew them together into a clumsy, and not altogether convincing, narrative. Maybe he just needs a ruthless editor."
1,Hated every second of it,"Ugh, what can I say? I love good writing, and it's clear Franzen is a capable enough one, I just couldn't stand any of the characters. If you like reading about completely unlikeable people in depressing settings with depressing lives, by all means, read away. As for me, I want to identify and at least root for someone. I don't need a happy, pat, complete ending, I just want to read without wanting to poke out my eyeballs at the end of the evening.Hated every second of this book."
1,Awful,"What a truly horrible book about dysfunctional characters that are completely unlikeable. This was my last foray into Oprah's book list. I suffered through the entire thing hoping for some redemption...but nothing. If I want to be depressed and disturbed for no reason I'll just watch the evening news, thanks."
1,WAY TOO LONG for what it is!!,"Really too bad. I was looking forward to reading this book way before Oprah recommended it. The stuff with Chip should have been condensed into a few paragraphs. He wasn't that interesting of a person anyway. The book wore me out and depressed me. So they had a bad childhood, who didn't. I have seen too many married couples like Al and Enid so that was the good part of the story. I just have to say I do not recommend this book at all. I finished it but felt awful afterward. I must add I will never read another book by an author who is so very stuck on himself. After the rude things he has said about Oprah he should be ashamed. I do not read books because she has recommend them. But he should be glad that she caused a lot of people to buy this book before word got around as to how bad it really is. Because then he wouldn't have sold any."
1,I Should've Known Better,"With all the hype surrounding this book I should've known better than to buy it. I read half of it and finally had to put it down when I realized it wasn't going to get any better. There is nothing enjoyable about this book. I couldn't care less about the characters - I didn't like them, I didn't hate them - they're pathetic and uninteresting. The author goes off on meaningless tangents that add nothing to the story. It seems as if he took ideas from many different stories and threw them together. I find it hard to believe that Oprah liked it. I've read most of the books on her list and while I didn't care for some of them, at least they were cohesive stories. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,I don't get it.,"I will be the odd person out here and admit that this is the first book that I have EVER read that I had no desire to finish. I realize that many people loved this book and so I've started to wonder if maybe I'm just missing something, but to me it just dragged on and on without any redeeming quality. Maybe I'm crazy, but it just was not for me."
2,Extremely disappointing - not even entertaining,I couldn't believe how just plain bad this book was. Reads like the drafts that Tom Wolfe threw in the trash -- or maybe a very very bad imitation of William Gaddis.Characters have no depth or reality. I can't believe that any one who reads this could ever get emotionally involved with any of them. The fact that this mess is getting generally positive reviews is a very sad commentary on the state of the novel in America today.
1,This was AWFUL,"My mother-in-law gave this book to me. She left her bookmark where she had stopped reading. I had gotten a little further than her, thinking that this must get better with all the hype that it has received. It never got better. I can't remember the last time I didn't finish a book. If there is a next time I don't finish a book, I will remember this one! I have never written a review here prior to this one, but I felt compelled, hoping I could prevent at least one person from wasting their time and money on this drivel."
2,"Over-rated, I guess.","Just finished reading this. I didn't personally find it that enjoyable, and it certainly didn't make me laugh. The writing style tried too hard to be smart and was too self aware, in my opinion. It is like he's trying to be DFW but doesn't have the chops. The story itself is fine, and the characters are reasonably interesting, but there's a lot of fat in his showoffy writing style. I'd rather he lose the thesaurus and just tell the story."
2,Longueurs,"Franzen has persuasively demonstrated that a diligent and determined forty-something author can crank out a nice, old-fashioned, bloated novel of social commentary. The book has about it the air of a revivalist feat and museum piece. Franzen is a dab hand at the longueurs inflicted on previous generations who had sufficient leisure to devote to slogging through uncompacted narratives stuffed with make-weight details. The novel was of course written to prove a point--to show that his carryings-on in Harper's were not all bluster and tantrum--but was it a point worth devoting half a decade to? I wish he had tried to write something new, something fresh. The Corrections is reactionary stuff, a long step backward."
2,"moderately depressing. not boring, but bland.","The story was moderately depressing. not boring, but a bland read. Author really shines here and there, but definitely too wordy at times. Overall finishing the book was unrewarding."
3,Average. Maybe I missed something.,"Well, I read this book in 2 days but when I was finished with it, I wondered what was so good about it. I have to hand it to Franzen, though - I've never in my life seen such long sentences. There's a record length sentence on page 11.I have seen this book compared to American Beauty. I saw that movie and didn't see what was so good about that, either.Maybe I just prefer a PLOT!"
2,"I struggled to get to page 282, but...","I struggled to get to page 282, but a talking feces is my limit. Clearly there are some redeeming qualities within the pages of The Corrections. There are even flashes of genius, but at no time was I awed by the prose or impressed with the scope of this novel. Others have handled dysfunctional families better. I would suggest Jane Smiley's A Thousand Acres. I am surprised that Oprah recommended this book. Because of her I have read such great novels as A Lesson Before Dying and House of Sand and Fog. I have no idea what compelled her to recommend this book. If you're looking for hapless characters trying to overcome dysfunctional childhoods, nobody does it better than Richard Russo."
1,Like arrogance - read this book.,"I have just put down Jonathan Franzen's The Corrections, for the LAST time. I have been attempting to read this month's selection for my book group for the last 3 weeks. (I (I usually read 3 books a week. I was one of two members to complete the 1400 page A Suitable Boy.) I find the book to be both arrogant and tedious. Notable - the 5 page discussion between Enid and a fellow cruise member - Lydia - illustrating the upper class, borderline mental illness that seems to enchant Franzen. I find myself skipping pages of this tedious verbal vomit in the hopes of finding something worthwhile. I've given up - halfway through the book. My advice - save your money. Luckily, I borrowed it from a fellow book club member. Actually, if I owened it I woulf take great pleasure ripping it apart."
1,Give me my money back,"Sorry, Senor Franzen, this will not do. Go back to your MFA program and demand your money back. Because it's obvious that you are not a Master of any Fine Arts, let alone writing."
1,two words- talking feces,"Do not feel the need to read this book unless you are a pretentious bore so earnest to prove that you are literary and current that you look and talk like Jonathan Franzen himself. This book would be ""quaint"" in five years if it weren't so detail-addled and completely devoid of humor. In its desperate quest for relevance, it creates completely unbelievable characters and embarrassing attempts at existentialism. After reading this, I felt much the same way I felt at the end of Titanic... what were those reviewers smoking? Did they pop some Mexican A-? I'm mean, I'm usually a big fan of reading about old guys with incontinence and hallucinations about excrement, but this piece of doo-doo not only talks too much, it stinks."
1,Among the Worst Books I Have Ever Read,"I don't ever remember feeling this angry after finishing a book. Angry that I wasted time reading this tome in hopes that it would become clear why reviewers thought so highly of it. It never did. And I was angry to think that anyone with such a dim, humorless, sad view of humanity would feel compelled to share it with all of us. Don't let the blurbs from DeLillo and David Foster Wallace on the jacket fool you...Franzen is _not_ in their league. There wasn't a single character who seemed remotely real to me at any point in the novel. Instead they seemed like monsters patched together out of anger and bitterness. Yuck!"
4,Shrink-Wrapped,"It's a rare treat to read a book that makes me love it. And despite my misgivings, I was overwhelmed by _The Corrections_ in all its prolix portentousness and smarty pants slickness.Why?1.I couldn't put it down once I'd got going.2.I was intrigued by the Oprah brouhaha3.It was summer (I am in Sydney, Australia) and I had time to indulge myself4.I am an academic and this is the best portrayal I've read of my generation's experience of the academy5.I know these people6.The book starts with brutality,and ends with compassion, but it's never corny7.Franzen writes like an angel8.It's a very great old-fashioned novel, in the style of Henry James, not Thomas Pynchon -- I've read enough second-rate Pynchon to last me a lifetime9.It made me think10. I laughed my head off.It's good!"
1,Disappointed,"I am very sorry to say I had a very hard time getting through half of this book. The subject (when I first bought this book) was very interesting. I thought this would be an appealing book. I think he overdid one of the characters in the plot and I felt very sorry for the main character. One of the characters in the story was hard to believe, I could not relate her to anyone or imagine her even being real.For whoever finishes this book, I hope the second half is better than the first...."
1,The Corrections,"No matter how I tried, I just could not get into this book. Franzen's flowery writing style basically bored me to tears."
1,No Stars! Skip it!,"This was a VERY long book and I regret the time I spent trying to find the point! It is a story about a bland,dysfunctional family. The characters are not at all sympathetic or interesting. Boring!"
3,"Like ""Seinfeld""...","...Well written, and clever. But the characters are so unlikable and pathetic, even as they are hilarious, that the book failed to satisfy me. Franzen's writing is great, but occasionally goes into that Look-how-good-I-am territory.Not a Must Buy, doesn't merit the hype, but still enjoyable."
3,a cut above average,"A solid book, but fatty and vividly unedited in spots. Franzen is a capable purveyor of middlebrow fiction-as-usual. Not a work of genius, not a masterpiece, but an earnest if clumsy piece of overreaching commercial fiction. He should consider writing for a TV drama series, because he has a sure sense of the expected detail. Or he could become an op-ed columnist."
1,What is all the fuss about?,Overall this book was not worth reading. The writing is excellent but the characters are unsympathetic and there is no plot. A little more than half way through I gave up and gave the book away. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters. This surprised me since I can finish almost anything. Don't waste your money.
2,Tell me again why he turned Oprah down...,"I picked up the book minutes before Oprah did, and happened to read Franzen's comments regarding his rejection of her, and I thought they were good enough for me to give the book a shot. He thought it had enduring potential. Also, at a reading Jane Hamilton gave, she said she loved it. Here's what I thought: Jonathan Franzen is really smart, pretty funny, can put a great sentence together, and it's a great psychological study of people. But I felt the book had no soul, and I'll be quite surprised if it endures."
2,Too Much of a Semi-Good thing,"I recognize the human frailties that infect our society.Franzen presents them in a satirical manner. But, he does notknow when to quit. He milks each point for all it is worth; finally causing somnolence.The book is in need of serious editing. Max Perkins, where are you when we need you most?True, there are insightful and beautifully expressed passages but 500 plus pages are excessive for what is being said."
1,Treats his characters like bugs under glass,"I could happily live the rest of my life without reading another dysfunctional family novel, but the critics were so united in their praise of this book that I had to see what all the fuss was about. Much ado about nothing, as it turns out. It should come as no surprise that Franzen looked down his nose at Oprah; Franzen looks down his nose at every character in his own novel. He manages to flay everyone from midwesterners to east coast intellectuals, conservatives to liberals--and while his wit is certainly well-honed, his utter lack of empathy or affection for his own characters makes this novel feel both cold and flat. He gives them glaring faults without saving graces, crushing losses without a hint of triumph. Then he sits back and mocks the way they flounder under their burdens. Literature with a capital L? More like Pretension with a capital P. This book is all head and no heart."
2,Yeck!,"What is all the hype about? I consider myself a well-read, well-rounded individual who loves all types of literature. This is not it. Knowing that Oprah has had her hits and misses, and after hearing all the accolades I went ahead and bought the book, even though the jacket description did not interest me. I should have gone with my instincts.Not only could I not identify with any of the characters, (not even the boarder characters that he details in such length) I was appalled and repulsed by them all. Having a father with Parkinson's, this books treats the terrible debilitating disease as a mere nuisance of getting older. You can't feel for the father, the mother or any of these brats they raised.Do yourself a favor; skip this book, unless you like to be depressed and sad. If you do, this book is for you!"
1,The Corrections,"This is the worst book I have attempted to read in years! The characters are totally stupid and I could not identify or care about any of them. The writing style is long and laborious. I tried to like the book because of all the hype over it, but I couldn't finish it. I can't imagine how it ever made the best seller lists. I wish I had read the customer reviews before I wasted my money on it."
2,Catch-23,"as a reader of literary fiction, i am appalled at the truth that this so-called writer, a man who supposedly wrote this novel blind folded and in his basement, has gotten away with one of the grandest literary rip-offs known to readers everywhere. the only thing worth saying is that this novel is funny, though it was funnier the first time i read it, when it was called Catch 22. The stylistic similarites are so obscenly close (the brother attends D--- College, J. Hellar's masterpeice has a Major De C---, Gitanis is the Syndicate)that anyone remotely familiar with Catch--22 should be able to put, well, 2 and 2 together and realize that every transitional paragraph is bitten from the great one himself. i am surprised, well, not really, that readers of this work, that reviewers of fiction, have been unable to recognize the blatent mimicing of this overwritten, underthought novel. If you want to read the corrected Corrections, read Catch 22, at least it has a moral purpose."
2,Insightful but inhumane,"I found The Corrections to be incredibly and painfully accurate at times. Overall, however, I was struck by how condescending and inhumane it was. I struggled to like just one character in the book, to find any empathy (as opposed to pity and even revulsion) for any one. I wonder if Mr. Franzen held his creations in such contempt, or if he failed to convey otherwise to me as a reader."
4,Kinda Grows on You,"This is the fourth release from the band that damaged their careers just by sounding too much like Led Zeppelin. When all the controversy was going around about them back then, I couldn't help but think; hey, I like their album! Call me a false metal poseur if you want, but I have liked each of Kingdom Come's releases.This CD was released in 1993, six years after their debut and all the bad press they got. Calling this album ""Bad Image"" sums up the band's situation pretty good. When I listened to it the first time, I kinda thought it sounded cheesy, you know, with the synthesizers. I have to admit, though, that the more I listened, the more I realized that each song is very well done. Guitars are not absent either, even though the synthesizers overshadow them. Overall it's a solid release that will grow on you. No song sounds like a Zep. song which shows that they were not just about that."
3,Nice,I do think the chiar covers would have worked great however; the size of the chair cover was too big for our chairs.
2,They work but the quality is lacking.,I bought four of these for a dining room chair set. They work fine but certainly do not look as elegant as the picture shows. Much more droopy. One of the four I bought came from the factory with a stain. Looked like bird droppings. Made in Pakistan.
3,A little baggy,Very satisfied with how quickley arrived and shipped in excellent condition. Cover itself is a little big. I realize it is designed to fit many different size chairs but I am covering what I thought was a standard size dinning room chair. It has lots of extra room in the back and every time you get up from sitting the base comes off. I am always putting them back on. decent buy for the money though. If your options are replace the chairs or cover them these are right your alley.
1,Not like they used to be,"These slipcovers were nowhere near the quality of slipcovers I purchased 6 years ago from Target (same seller here). The previous covers were a rugged cotton canvas, these were much thinner although still the same price. I returned them."
2,cheap cheap cheap,"you get what you pay for. not for a high use chair as the material is very thin - yes, hold it up and you can see light thru it."
1,Better dead than live!!!!,"No wonder this band was one of the thousand metal bands from the eighties to disappear without a trace!!! Seldom have I heard such a pedestrian, commn and cheap metal sound. The drummer is also the singer, big deal!! When it comes to what matters (the music), it's so poor and silly and cliched, well ( and I'm a big metal fan!). Sad album, recorde live in 1993, after the band's best days were already past."
4,"Good overall review of the systems, with some specific details","Similar but not as comprehensive as the actual Citroen manual ( which is in two volumes) basic maintenance and operational features shown. Decent illustrations, written in GB 'english' but easy to understand!"
3,SHE'S NOT DEAD. SHE'S SICK.,"This is slow developing zombie story. In fact the zombies, or walkers as they are called, are slow developing acquiring motor skills and aggression over time. After an unexplained viral outbreak kills off most of the world's population, a handful of survivors hold up in a building. With supplies running low, some decides to venture out. A group of three opt to go to the country to become ""hippie farmers."" Another couple decide to live like kings off the fat of the land, party in the White House and at Graceland.That is pretty much it. Zombies are attracted to noise and lights. David Carradine has a minor role. It is an okay zombie film that has been oversold as something wonderfully unique. What was that dream thing in the middle of the film?Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
3,Decent Zombie Fare,"AUTUMN is one of those films that takes some getting used to. I liked the slow animation and build up of the zombies themselves. The ""artsy"" camera work was a bit to be desired and came off like a made for TV movie or student film. The acting was passable, and the plot was interesting. I really enjoyed the film once but will likely not view it again unless it is with friends. David Carradine's part is small and under used. It is not his best work. He seemed to be put in the film to just have a ""big"" name and to simply exhibit ""gross"" behaviors. His part could have been so much more. (By the way, I really like Carradine and respect much of his work.) I just think that his part was poorly written and it did not inspire his best acting. All in all, AUTUMN is worth seeing if you are a zombie fan....once."
5,A definitive book by two outstanding authors,"This is a definitive book by two outstanding authors, and should therefore be on everyone's reading list. I agree with Publisher's Weekly - this is going to be essential reading for those who want to stay informed in today's increasingly troubled world. Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003) ..."
3,Not too bad but it didn't blow me away,"I purchased this soundtrack partly on the strength of the very positive reviews seen on the Amazon site and partly on the strength of hearing the track ""little girl,"" which is also on the ""Time 3"" album. I have taken some pleasure in the album, but potential buyers should be warned that the cd is only about 33 minutes long, and consists - besides the song ""little girl"" - of rather undistinguished, subdued background music. Only 2 songs besides ""little girl"" have lyrics, and the lyrics are pretty thin. It is not an ambitious symphonic rock concept album.If you are a serious Journey fan who owns most or all of the band's albums you might enjoy this. Evidently it has a strong cult following. But I think most people will remain underwhelmed upon hearing it."
3,Dual Personal Coffeemaker,"Coffeemaker works great, although I believe that the cup lids are defective. When taking a sip of coffee and finding most of it running down your chin."
2,"Lukewarm Coffee, not hot enough","This machine makes lukewarm, not hot, coffee. The whole point of coffee is to be hot. I do not recommend purchasing this product. I would not buy it again and am considering purchasing something else."
4,Coffee on the go,Good for filling travel mugs and just large coffee mugs. There don't seem to be many of this type of coffee maker at this price. I'm very pleased with this product.
1,Junk!,I received this item for Christmas. One brew basket does not open so that coffee can be put into it; neither brew backet can be rovoved for cleaning. I plan to return it immedaitely. Black and Decker should be ashamed of producing such a shoddy appliance.
2,"Well, it makes coffee.....",".....but nothing I would ever buy for myself.The brew-into-go-cups format is worthless. Get something a bit more versatile than this single-purpose machine.It works OK, but kinda slow & loud."
2,Just not right....,"I really wanted this to work, and even after reading all the reviews, I gave it a shot. At the end of the day, I used this daily for a few weeks, and the ""burnt plastic"" taste never worked its way out of the maker. I just could not get a good tasting cup of coffee out of it.It's a great concept, and with better materials, I bet this would be a good product. But I think the internals of this are the cheapest they can throw in, and it shows.I just returned mine today."
1,Ok if you like cold Coffee,"I've had this a week now and at first I thought my coffee was bad (new can) so I tried it in my old pot. Tasted fine. So again I tried it in the double coffee maker. The coffee does not even get hot enough to really brew the coffee. The coffee taste I thought might be from the cups so used a different one. Same taste. It has a plastic taste.My DH got this for me. I've tried to use it 4 times now.I'm not a big coffee drinker so we thought this would be great.If you like a loud coffee maker wakes the kids 2 rooms down, cold coffee that you have to warm in the microwave and coffee half brewed. You might like this. Otherwise save your money and go get a $20 maker with a glass pot and have hot brewed coffee that does not wake the house"
5,"Great album, a must buy for an metal fan!","I found this CD for 12.50 on[...](The bands own website). I had the cassette version and finally had to stop playing it for fear the tape would wear out! Like I said in the title, this is a must buy for any metal fan. Even if you have never heard of Kick Axe, give this one a spin, you will be pleasantly suprised!"
1,Boring... Jackie Collins wantabe,"Butterflies is a tamer, more boring version of the Jackie Collins books. The title should have just been Hollywood Moms. Too bad she didn't develop the characters more, they were very one dimentional, I just couldn't care about them."
1,Disappointed,"I received the outfit just as pictured very pleased with shipment but the hat (which makes the outfit) had a small hole at top of the brim. Emailed Customer Service they said to send back the hat back which I did immediately. Emailed Customer service to be sure they received it they emailed back they did receive the hat, that was 2 weeks ago. No Hat, No Emails, No Customer Service, Now I have a $50.00 outfit without the Main portion the HAT....If they don't have it and have to order it or maybe never get a new one they should let me know, not just avoid my emails...I wanted this for his 6 month picture which is in September... Too bad for me."
4,"AVALANCHE: Great footage, informative, entertaining","This movie is the perfect selection for anyone who is new to the avalanche field and wants to better understand the basics of snow science. It is also ideal for the experienced backcountry traveler who is tired of the sometimes boring technical avalanche videos. The simple yet scientific look at how weather, snowpack, and terrain can combine to produce an avalache is very well presented. The dramatic footage, informative graphs and diagrams, and amazing avalanche stories make this video a must for anyone who spends time in avalanche terrain."
4,Van Johnson:MGM's Golden Boy,"Having been of fan of this actor for years, it was a pleasure to read a book that was filled with information about his life. The book was a fair and balanced look at the actor's life. I learned a great deal about his early years in Rhode Island and how he became an actor. Since there are so few books about Van Johnson out there, this is a good one to read."
3,So much fun,I wasw so happy to find these. I will be buying more...I only have 4 virtual cards left to get.
4,I can identify,"Great watch for those just starting to believe they can do it. Words of wisdom are given by some very knowledgable people. Overall, I learned a lot and was inspired."
1,Truly Awful,"This recording sounds like it was made by an amateur high school orchestra. Unfortunately Naxos orchestral recordings can be a bit of a lucky dip. Some of them are great (the Bax symphonies for example) whilst others, like this execrable cacaphony, are absolute shockers. Shostakovich would turn in his grave if he heard this one."
1,Incorrect ingredients and just not good for a cold.,The ingredients it claims to contains that the seller has written are incorrect. It does nothing for a cold or congestion. I would give it two stars for taste but since the ingredients are not correct and it does nothing for cold and congest it deserves one star. I will not buy again.
4,Must Reading for the Christian Bi-Polar and Their Families,Nancy Hagerman shares personal insights into the bi-polar experience of a Christian. The book may be as valuable to the family of a bipolar Christan as it will be to the bi-polar Christian. The author emphasizes that the illness is spiritual as well as physical and the fact that both spiritual and physical healing is necessary. The author relates her experiences from the viewpoint of a mature Christian who gives glory to her Lord for delivering her from The Pit.
5,The last person who reviewed this obviously doesnt know anything,"i hope the review Sergio Morales didnt turn off a person from buying this marvelous record.its so funny really,,when he says that this album has flat guitar work,please..and then he goes by the really laughable comment of""they dont even play the symphonic instruments! how do they tour??"",,im asuming he thinks every band must tour and or hasnt heard of synths,,,and the fact that one can arrange music for instruments you dont play doesnt pass through this ignorants mind"
4,A Fantastic Book!!,This was the first Hardy Boys book I read and it was great. I own 125 Hardy boys books now. The plot in the Clue of the Schreeching Owl was exciting and there was adventure starting on the first page. I really recommend this book although it's not as good as some.
1,confusing Training and from the Source!,There are many examples given that do NOT work before getting to something that does work. Each is explained as if it will work.Obviously the sourse has been talking to himself too long and has no idea how to teach this information to someone who dosen't all ready know actionscript.
2,"Different cover, same material","I was hoping for a different slant on this material from the previous book but with the exception of a couple Flash 8 specific examples, this is either exactly the same as Actionscript for Flash MX 2004 or worse, with not as much detail. Waste of money."
3,disappointed in workmanship,This light is beautiful but not put together very well. the piece that screws into the bottom of the item has no treads and when we put it up it fell. thank goodness we were under it to catch it. would not order another.
5,My first scanner and I am in love!,"This scanner is simple to set up and use. It is fast and quiet. Scans photos, book pages and everything else with great quality. I am as happy as can be!"
5,Awesome workout!,"I found this workout to be very beneficial for me. It is not as strenuous on the body like other forms of exercise, but you can sure see and feel that it is working! Just what I was looking for!"
4,"Very good, overall!","I purchased this to replace my VHS pilates tapes. This is very comprehensive and I like the way you can progress from one level to the next. This DVD does incorporate other pilates equipment, so if you only have the reformer, you will need to make some modifications to your routine. The only downside to this DVD is that I wish it had music."
4,best fighting game since street fighter,"This game was great. Fun and exciting and yet my little brother isn't satisfied with it. He said it is to hard to do a lot of moves and there are hardly any combos. I think it's easy to do a lot of the moves are easy. To me there are easy ,but to a lot of other kids the moves will be hard to master. The graphics are excellent and the game play is awsome. The moves are exactly as there in the motion picture."
2,An Exercise in Confirmation Bias,"Reminiscent of the simplistic analysis pervasive in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, Mr. Friedman is not reporting, but rather seeking to support his obvious preconceived hypothesis. Namely, the theory that the attack was a function of Arabic feelings of inferiority and jealousy of American institutions. Two stars for the revealing look into the 2003 zeitgeist -- the root of arrogance that lead us into our failed wars in Iraq and Afghanistan."
2,Buyer Beware of Free Gifts,"Ordered this from their website and they automatically send more essesntial boost vitamins for $19.99 plus shipping and then they also were going to charge me another 19.99 for signing me up for their website access. These were hidden under the ""free gifts"" which in the end cost you another $50 per cycle. Just know what you are ordering before you end up surprised with a package in the mail and new charges."
5,A different take,"These are some fairly free interpretations of the keyboard partitas. Rubsam uses a greater degree of rubato than most players would dare, but I think it imparts a more improvisatory character to the pieces which I really liked, remembering that Bach himself was one of the greatest improvisers who ever lived. Rubsam is sensitive to each line, and uses the freer rhythmic interpretation to nuance the counterpoint very tastefully.I'm especially fond of his interpretation of the thrid partita giving it a sense of gradually mounting energy through each movement, emphasizing thow they all work together. I have some other versions of the third partita on both harpisichord and piano, but this is my favorite."
5,Excellent Understated Protection,I bought the shirt to wear beneath my long sleeved white uniform shirt. It helps me greatly to stay warm when paramedic duties in the outdoors would be hampered wearing bulkier coats and such. Well recommended.
2,Doesn't work as well as wool for odor control,"I have a lot of base layer stuff as I commute daily year-round on my bicycle. I got the underarmor as a gift so I put it in the rotation. I found that while it is good enough for against the skin comfort it doesn't breathe as well as the wool garments I use. Also, it does a terrible job with odor control. I can't wear this more than once before it needs some cleaning whereas the wool will go as long as I care to (I mean forever)."
1,Poor quality and/or packaging,"I purchased 8 B&B; plates along with 4 of the Blue Willow cereal bowls.All arrived with small chips around the edges of the plates and the bowls. I returned the items and asked for replacements, all the replacements had chips. In addition the dishes had small pits and the blue coloring was not uniform. I would rate the plates poor quality. The cereal bowls were somewhat better, but packaging was bad causing the chips."
5,Very good beautiful pop rock,"Excuse my english.Most of eleven songs is very clear, strong and soft from genre pop rock. One song is made with Lee Aaron. This CD sounds like european BonFire, american Black n blue - Without love or it looks likes new Suzi Quatro."
2,Discription not clear,The discription of this book does not clearly explain the context. The text is strickly the lyrics of Vajda's song. God is mentioned on every other page and the illustrations are lovely but this book it not a good read out loud book for little ones. The concepts are too complex for them to understand. I would not buy it again.
4,Good no-nonsense bug holder,"Got this for my 3 year old daughter and she likes it a lot. I like it because it is a simple round container with no pointless scenery to obscure viewing. However, the feeding tower does not fit snugly, so if you want it to be ""escape proof"", leave that part off and just use the cap provided."
3,"It's the ""Bootylicious"" single","I get really annoyed when Sony Australia does this. They release a new single and loads it up with remixes of the previous therefore we are always one single behind when it comes to the remixes. It's not all the exciting really for American fans unless a maxi single wasn't released for ""Survivor"" then you can rejoice the remixes to ""Survivor"". The remixes ain't that appealing because it's just different beats and less dramatic and the pace is a little faster than the album version and that's about it. However, the main attraction to the single is the Enhanced component of the live video of DC3's performance of ""Independent Women Part I"" at the Brits awards. Recommended for die hard DC3 fans only."
4,Necessary Protection,"I bought this Respirator because I had to paint my Honda myself since none of the ****ing shops here in Boise would touch it (cause it's not a classic... wtf...)The two cartridges that came with the product lasted throughout the entire job, and there's no freaking way that my lungs would of have survived without it. Real paint releases so many particles into the air that the shop looked like a volcano had been spewing ash inside. I can't imagine not having a respirator like this for this job. If it helps, the one with the eye mask would of have been better. I felt that I was getting too much crud in my eyes and had to wash them every so often. I had the normal safety glasses on, but a sealed face mask would of have been better IMO..."
5,a real mask,"The best review I can give this item is that it took several years, but this mask is a replacement for one that I used up over several years."
2,needs some editing,"I hope the 4th edition is better than the 3rd. On page 876, they list the 50 states but only 48 are listed. They left out Wyoming & West Virginia. On page 1037, they mispelled Korean; it was spelled Koren."
4,Good fit,"The fit was fine. Does have a clamp in line with one of the converters so need to tighten to not have leaks. Also, need to purchase the flange gasket."
2,Quality of fabric should dictate cost,"I am very disappointed with the lack of quality for the advertized ""velvet"" of Mrs. Claus's costume. The price was rather steep compared to other costumes so I attributed that to the quality of the fabric, velvet. I was not pleased that the quality of this fabric was inferior. It's not the shiny, soft to the touch velvet. It is more like a stiff, cheap fabric used for outdoor red Christmas bows. The lace was also inferior and the sewing of the apron was as well.Totally unsatisfied with this purchase."
2,Kindle edition is really awful...,"This seems to have started as a decent, fairly typical romance novel, but whoever prepared it for Kindle deserves to be keel-hauled, as it were. The whole thing reads like it was translated into English by someone who doesn't speak the language. The grammar, sentence structure, etc. are horrible, and so distracting that I gave up on the story less than halfway through. The commas are in the wrong places, the indentation and paragraphs are done incorrectly, and no one in the novel says anything -- all the dialogue is ""stated"", even when that term is patently unsuitable for the tone and meaning of the dialogue. It's too bad, because it could have been an enjoyable, if fluffy, read. I'm not familiar with this author but I'm willing to bet she has no idea that her work is being presented in such a shoddy way."
3,Comes In Second Place,"This book was published in 1927. It would be a very important book if it had not been followed by his second book, ""The Textbook of Pistols and Revolvers"", in 1935. The second book is an expansion of the first.Almost everything in the first book is in the second. Sometimes it seems almost word for word, page for page is repeated verbatim. And there is a great deal of additional material. It is also a better written book. His writing ability matured considerably.Buy ""The Textbook of Pistols and Revolvers"". It is easier to find, usually costs less, and has a lot more information."
5,"Drop one on, its time to jam!","This game is by far the best game on PS1!Wham bam thank you mam!If you want a game that has an engrossing storyline, an awsome chracter to play,nice levels and design put in to them,then apocalypse is for you!I got this game 2 years ago and not only have I beat it once but 4 whole times!this game is like so addictive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,A view of life from the eyes of a New York teenage mother,"I was impressed with the way that Sapphire was able to createa character like Clarice and tell the story from her point ofview, without making it seem foolish. The ending could haveused a little work, I thought -- if the attempt was to justshow a snapshot of her life, that's fine, but it seemed there wasjust too much history and too much story given for that to workwell. A nice novel, and a nice view into another world, butthere wasn't much there that a reader wouldn't have known."
4,Read deep and time for change,"I have not read PUSH yet, I was just shopping for it. I found the reviews...almost more than I wanted to know. I have just finished read THE COLDEST WINTER EVER. My co-worker told me of PUSH. Emotions I felt just reading the review takes me to other things going on in the world and in my community that I know I can help make a difference. PUSH gives me the push I need to help inspire and change things. I can't wait for delivery I am going to the book store today!!"
2,very disappointed,"I was excited to read this book based on all I had heard about it. After starting to read it, I was very disgusted due to the vile language. I do think it would be a very well written book with out all the language. I do not think teenagers need to be reading this book!"
3,Well worth reading,"It was emotionally painful to read this book. The descriptions of sexual, physical and emotional abuse are hard to forget, I was still thinking about it hours after I put the book down. Anyone who is a victim of abuse should be made aware that this small book can bring back some memories for the reader, it certainly did me. I like that Precious never gave up on learning to read and write, and was a good mother. Not a book I would call my friends and say , "" you HAVE to read this! """
2,kinda disturbing,"i don't know what to say about this particular book. It was a hard read, given the fact that it was written EXACTLY how the character was supposed to have been speaking, and the fact that her father was so terrible as was her mother, it made it hard to continue. However there was a certain feeling you got as you read that made you want to know the outcome of this troubled girls' life. Like i said ............kinda disturbing."
1,Pure Pathos,"I found ""Push"" to be an exercise in pathos that leads to a layering of unbelievably hyperbolic situations and purple prose. The reliance on sexual language and description of sexual acts is pedantic and obnoxious. The story is written well enough for me to cheer for the focus character, but, artistically, the book is sophomoric. The style is reminiscant of an immature writer trying to gain respect through gritty language and shifts of narrative voice -- the language choices are justified given the personae of the dramatized narrator, but the voice shifts are illogical and ill conceived. Character development is simplistic. I would not recommend ""Push"" to anyone with a weak stomach which puts it on the level of a bad carnival ride."
2,Not as good as expected...,"I was very excited about the book, but was not at all as good as I expected."
5,Tragic and Real Novel,"I watched the movie Precious before reading this book. I know, that's usually a no-no in reading books that where made into movies 101. I was so touched by the movie, that I just had to read the book. The story is so gripping, sad and just really reminds you what goes on right under our noses in this society. It really affected me. The story is intense and the author does not try to sugar-coat anything. I suggest this book to anyone who likes human-interest stories."
5,Amazing book!,"This book is so gripping and raw, I quite literally could not put it down and finished it in one sitting. Granted as it is only about 150 pages, it is not a long book to read. I didn't want it to end. The story unfolds and grabs hold of you. It takes you through the entire range of emotions and ultimately, inspires. I loved it.To the point of some of the other reviewers - yes, it is raw and the language a bit rough. But this is a first person account of life as an illiterate girl living in poverty in New York - this is how a person in her situation speaks. I think some of the other reviewers are missing the point on that one. Not to mention that this begins on page 1 of the book and continues on, so to act surprised that it is written that way is beyond me.This book was amazing, I highly recommend it!!"
3,difficult to read,"I was interested in this book when the trailer came out for this movie. Great story - I truly felt for Precious, but I was disappointed how difficult it was to read this short book. I understand what they're saying, but it would've been so much easier to read and a better flow if it wasn't written how they speak, not so much at least."
4,Must read!,"Wow, Once I picked up the book ""Push"" by Sapphire, I could not put it down. It was a very strong, believable story that had me holding my stomach the whole time. I have suggested to all of my friends, this is a must read book. The langauge/ dialect was difficult at first, but it gets easier as the books goes forward."
5,in your face,"this book was pretty ""in your face."" it was disturbing, but disturbing in an eye-opening way. others might say too disturbing-others that want to close their eyes and ignore what really goes on. this book is heart-wrenching because it makes you realize (or readdress) issues that really and truly go on in our world. i would definitely recommend it to others."
2,not what I expected,"I think I bought the wrong version of this book. It was very sketchy. It's usually not the case, but I think I will like the movie better than the book."
5,Push Saphire to write more like this one!,"This is one of my all-time favorite books. I bought ten copies (from Amazon, of course) to share with friends. Her precious Precious has the voice of hope and the faith of the saved. I could not put this book down and even wrote Ms. Saphire because I was so moved by this tome. I feel it is a must read and that every person who has any hope for the future should read her words. Brilliant!"
4,Didnt have to be PUSHed to read it,"This is our book club read of the month. After the first few pages i was thrown, like ..what??? Then i could not put it down. It was very gripping. I wanted to scream, shout and cry. I am curious and anticipating the movie(Precious) on the big screen"
4,I'm glad I read this book!,"When this book arrived in the mail, I almost sent it back. It looked too short. The author looked like an angry black woman. I read the first page and the content, language and style shocked me. But I kept the book and read it. Boy, am I glad I did! The book moved me to tears. The world the author created is so far from the one I live in. But I was drawn into that world and lived it for a short time. PLEASE READ THIS BOOK. Everyone should. ""Push"" should be required reading in suburban schools where everyday life can sometimes be too easy. I will not foget Precious Jones anytime too soon"
2,Not believable,"I found inconsistencies throughout the entire story. In addition, personally it was somewhat too over the top which made it unbelievable to me."
5,raw heartwrenching and very true,"A books that wraps itself around your soul and teaches us about humanity, how alike we are regardless of our sexuality, race, or cultural differences. We are alike in pain. It was like reading poetry."
1,Who checks the prices for these books?,I keep checking back but they still haven't fixed the price. Almost 500 dollars for a book is a glaring error. They still won't fix it so I can read it on my kindle.. grrrrrrr. And this isn't the first book pricing mistake I've seen. Get with it Amazon.
2,another color purple bleck,what the difference btw this book and the color purple where the main character is nurtured by her husbands mistress? ANd would it be popular if Oprah did not put her stamp of approval? Its sad that any fiction author can't succeed unless oprah says its worthy.
5,Fab Poos rock still rock on!,"With their quirky tongue in cheek humor, the Fab Poos failed to get the recognition they deserved in the late 70's and poor managment/record company probs led to their demise in late 1980. I saw the Poodles twice live and still won't forget how fab they were: Mirror stars indeed. Favorite cuts: B-Movies, Mr. Mike, Workshy - lead singer Tony DeMeur still performs in London in a band called Ronnie and the Rex - and a new CD is due out soon, called ""Return of the Fabulous Poodle"" - Let's hope some brilliant record company in the USA picks it up!! His Master's Choice is what you've got now to tide you over!!"
1,use only if you like either scalding or cold water,"we purchased the Brizo kitchen faucet when we had ur home built. Loved the look and technology BUT after just getting off the phone with them for the fourth time they now tell me that it isn't their fault that it doesn't mix water (it's either hot or cold nothing in between). It's. The fault of the rinnai. Instant hot water system, even though four bathroom sinks, 2 showers, one bathtub and a slop sink don't have a problem. DON'T BUY"
5,My 10 year old son loves Humphrey!!,"Our first foray into Humphrey came from the school book fair. My son, who is 10 and likes to read, dove right in to this hampter's daily life as a class pet. I have even found some of the humor well, humorous. After he read the first book in one day, I ordered all the others. He has read them all and is now starting again. I wish that the author would write some more Humphreys!"
5,"Our favorite hamster, by a mom","We read this aloud as a family, and read it in record time because no one ever wanted to stop. ""Can we have one more chapter PLEASE?!?!?!"" My son (age 7 1/2) liked that Humphrey made lots of friends and we all liked how he took vocabulary tests. My daughter (age 10) liked how they use hamster language, like squeak instead of speak.Humphrey's a smart little creature. If he can keep a journal, maybe a kid can too! I liked the way Humphrey helped us understand why certain people might behave the way they do. Humphrey's character is portrayed with more depth and dimension than most books' human characters. Skillfully yet simply told.The extras at the back of the book are a neat bonus as well: puzzles, riddles, Humphrey trivia quizzes, and more. We were delighted to discover today, looking at the author's website, that there's another Humphrey book now. We can't wait to read it."
5,Great Chapter Book for K-3,"My Kindergarten boy LOVES this book! I read it to him every night, and he was very sad when we finished, because he wanted it to go on and on!!!! Humphrey is a delightful character. The teachers, school children and others in the book such as the pincipal, custodian and teacher's husband all are characters the young reader can appreciate and enjoy. Humphrey learns about each character's problem when he goes home with him or her over a weekeend or holiday, comes up with ""a Plan"" for each to help with the problem, and teaches each child valuable lessons. Nothing not to like here!!!! Great book to be read to Kindergarteners. Good read-it-yourself chapter book for good readers, 2nd grade probably. 15 chapters. Not an early chapter book."
4,Strange vibes for a Cleveland band,"Electrifying... Somewhere in the middle of the CD you get the impression the freaks have somehow leveitated themselves and are hovering above you, dubbing like mad..."
3,A bit deceived,"The problem is that, at first, I was really exited to find out that they've decided to put Astroboy episodes back on tape.But I thought that it was The second version, the one that aired in the 80. I must say I prefer the second version because it was the one I use to watch when I was a kid. But still, I'd say this version is still interesting.But then again, it's a bit too dark and it is difficult to see all the details.Beside that, if you are an Astroboy fan, you are gonna like this piece of collection."
2,Blah Blah Blah,I wish I had seen some reviews before I bought this book.The characters are limpid and the sex scenes are uninspired. Its all whips and [fannies] so if you like that stuff - go for it.
5,"Very readable, excellent art history volume","I have read this book and used it as a reference resource. As per the critical reviews, a highly readable narrative of nineteenth century art. Gives insight not only onto artists and their work, but also onto the economic, social, and political factors of the nineteenth century and how they affected and influenced art making. Fluid writing, well presented scholarly arguments, excellent supporting images."
1,Are these people talking about the same d12 i'm hearing?,This is the worst group effort from the worst group in the rap game ever! The only decent track is the last one where feminem disses limp bizkit. D12 is a clown show and it's obvious why Marshall signed them because they make him look like less of a fool! The most annoying out of all the members is the extremely idiotic bizarre. This d--k head talks about raping his sister and getting head from his grandma! It's obvious that they only appeal to crackhead surburb kids and poor white trash that like laughing at dumb n---as!
4,This is the one of rap album you must have.....,"ok, this is d-12's debut album and it is dope or should i say decent and totally worth the money. if you don't own one, go buy it soon. of course, there are also negative bits. still i'd say this album is better than the eminem show....if i recommend you the fattest track here would beAmerican Psycho by Eminem, Bizarre & Kon Artis andGirls by Eminem but all the songs are good.the tracks you should avoid isi guess all the skits and Purple pills in the album."
4,da best d12 album,"classic material straight outta dirty detroit! d12 is really underrated even tho it may not seem like it. theyre always best on they underground stuff, if u liked this get the d12 world album, some of there underground stuff, solo stuff, stuff by promatic, or ne thing by theyre friends (outsidaz, obie trice, fat killahz, paradime, u can find sum more online.)best trax: da whole thing."
4,Eminem Helps,"This Album is very similar to the track on the Marshall Mathers LP, in other words some of the tracks are like ""Remember Me"" on that album. They are spearheaded by Eminem and are accompanied by the memebers of D12; Bizarre and Kuniva and others. I think the tracks that Eminem has a huge role are exectional such as #7 American Psycho, this is an excellent track. The D12 members are very talented and Eminem is a great producer."
5,"nice rhymes, nice beats","i like this cd alot...gonna go purchase it in about ten mintues...dowloaded like 8 songs and i am definitly gonna buy this...i love the rhymes, expecilly Blow My Buzz, Nuthin but Music, Purple HIlls, ... On You"
1,BUY ESHAM AND NATAS,"D12 are a bunch of biterz and they try to b like esham n natas....by the wayz, d12 are a bunch of handicap group that sounds so silly with that stupid white kid name eminem....did anyone see that old video with d12 called purple pills....hahahahaha.....they look like they all got issues and they look like they all got down syndrome because the fat dude was wearin boxers like a fruit and he dancin wit midgetz....what the hell wuz dat....and that dummy that dresses up like a cactus.....that whole video is just for kid just to brainwash them with kiddy stuff with the kiddy songs.....go buy esham and natas....they are wwaaayyyyy better than thiz silly kiddy crap."
2,Just not worth it,"Look, let me first start out by saying that if you have any liking towards this album, i would advise you not to read this review. Does this sentence sound familiar? If it does, it's only because it has started out every cd eminem has done! I think that is pretty dumb. Eminem should have featured D12 on his first two albums and not made this record at all. His best work were his last two albums. This one is extremely weak. Em and D12 were only concerened with shocking the listener rather than coming up with good beats. The one and only track I like is Girls, that is Eminem at his best. If you really want a good summer album, pick up Turk's cd."
4,new fan,"I boght this cd about a month ago after listening to it at a friends house. I thought it was going to be just like every other eminem cd, but i was wrong. I really enjoy this cd because every song doesn't sound the same. i don't have to skip any tracks and i haven't gotten bored while listening to it. I think it is a great cd for parties or chillin by yourself. i am glad a spent my money on this cd.CSE 112 DNK"
3,"Ok, not quite enough motivation","This is an okay book. It's biggest shortcoming is that many of the examples don't teach me anything. I read through the descriptions and they are okay, but not enlightening. Some of the pictures aren't really that good either. So it's an okay book. Not one I'm likely to read more than once, though.On the other hand, once your wife buys this book you can argue that she's the one suggesting you get a Hasselblad with a 100mm lens and two flashes... which is the standard setup in this book."
2,"Oh, so this is the UT2003 manual","I purchased this ""book"" (actually, it is like a small magazine) because the booklet included with UT 2003 was woefully inadequate and nearly impossible to read. Frankly, I think game distributors are skimping on the manuals to try and make us buy more game-related goods. I don't agree with the practise. So far as I'm concerned, with I buy an expensive game, it should ship with it's own manual.This game guide has over-head maps of all the levels, in case you are interested, but actually they are printed quite small and thus are not of much use. You have to squint to try to see the details. The maps need to be much bigger.Basically, this guide is like a manual, standard stuff that doesn't really have much that will help you play the game better. Best to search out online guides for that."
3,Hope you never need the driver!,"For some reason, this device stopped working on my desktop computer. Somehow the computer ""lost"" the driver for the device, which is odd seeing as how it worked before. I searched the web for the driver and finally asked Kingston for it via their help request, and they told me the driver was not available. If they don't have it, how did Windows get it?After that I tried the device in my laptop, and it worked just fine."
5,"Good book, hard exam...better bone up","The exam was harder than I thought, and I'm glad I used this book. It covered most of what I saw, though there were a few things that I think I got just from my experience (two years network admin.) Overall, I think the book does a very good job. I've used Sybex a bunch, and like them."
5,Great safety and general sunglasses,Superior anti-glare protection. I use them as sunglasses and this is my second pair. The first pair just suffered from my constant use.
3,"IT""S Okay not total bible a lot of rice opion","Have lot of about heaven book, ths has his thought, normally like rice abut not one of his best, its okay"
5,Another masterpiece by Kadohata!,"The author has presented an actual historical account of how Japanese Americans were ill treated during World War II. By using characters such as Sumiko, the reader is taken on a journey through the eyes of an eleven-year old girl whose family was sent to live in a ""Relocation Center."" We see the pride, humiliation, and courage the Japanese Americans endured. This would be an excellent book to share with upper elementary and middle school students!"
5,Great reception and looks much better the OEM,"I have a lift on my truck and my OEM antenna hit off the top of my garage door. I decided to get the Stubbie 21.Reception is great, maybe even better than OEM. Doesn't hit off my garage. The antenna is pretty heavy. I would suggest using lock-tite blue on the threads. I didn't do this on initial install and after a few rides the antenna had become very loose. You do not want this thing flying off while you are driving. It will cause damage.After lock-tite was applied, I've not had any issues with the antenna becoming loose.For reference I have 2011 Tacoma."
5,Wouldn't trade it for anything!,"This printer has been nothing but wonderful. I've had it for almost a year now and its FINALLY time to change the ink. Its quick and quiet for printing text, and the photo printing is better than my local lab! If you want a great, affordable printer that will not let you down, get it today."
5,Top-notch printer,"I've had this printer for 3 weeks, and so far I'm happy with it. The Canon i860 has a solid, well-built frame, good speed, and the print quality is nice. Machine noise is about average.The Canon i860 uses five ink cartridges, which supposedly is cheaper in the long run and results in better quality images.The setup CD-ROM supplied by Canon does not install other programs without your knowledge, unlike the HP 5150, which I briefly owned.The Canon i860 has a front USB port that CERTAIN digital cameras can use. This means you can print out pictures without using your computer.If you are going to use your printer quite a bit, I recommend getting good quality inkjet paper, not the cheapest brand you can find. Believe me, the type of paper definitely makes a difference in print quality. And make sure the Canon i860 software knows which type of paper you are using, such as plain paper, photo paper pro, glossy photo paper, matte photo paper, etc..."
4,A very nice printer but....,"A very nice printer but it's already obsolete. Canon is replacing this model (i860) with the soon to be released PIXMA iP4000 Photo Printer. The iP4000 will be even faster and feature automatic duplex printing. The iP4000 will have the same street price $149 USD. Hopefully, the quality of the iP4000 will exceed that of the i860 but its anyone's guess at this point. If you're considering the i860 I'd suggest that you wait a month until the iP4000 is released especially now since the $30 rebate on the i860 has expired (July 17). The other option is buying the i960 instead. Decisions, decisions..."
3,Canon i860 print head and cleaning issues,"We have owned a Canon i860 for about 1 1/2 years now. It started out ok but the print heads need cleaning badly because of streaking and gaps in color prints. The head cleaning capability has stopped working and it will no longer perform this maintenance procedure. Also, the color reservoirs are somewhat expensive compared to what you can now get for other printers like HP. If I had it to do over I would get an HP printer that replaces the printer head along with the ink when you need to refill the ink. That way there is less likelihood of a clogged printer head after many months of service. The Canon help reference that came with the printer, both printed and on screen are less than helpful at times. I always like Canon products but have run out of patience with this printer and the accompanying software."
1,Not a happy Canon i860 customer,"I've had this printer for less than 2 yrs and it has stopped printing anything normally. The only colors that will print are black and cyan. I've tried everything, print head cleaning, etc, and it still doesn't print the correct colors. I refuse to pay Canon $9.95 to tell me the print head is shot....I'm assuming this is what's wrong after reading some of the reviews. I think it's an excellent idea that Canon not manufacture any more of these printers.....apparently Canon does too."
2,DON'T EXPECT QUALITY TEXT PRINTING,"Apparently, this printer's forte is photo printing. I made the mistake of assuming it would print quality text documents too, which seems a much simpler task. I am very disappointed in the frequent ink smears, streaks, and blotches on the pages. It takes frequent cleaning procedures to minimize the streaks and blotches. I am incredulous that the ink smears when a highlighter pen is used on the text. This happens on pages with dry ink that were printed many months earlier! Highlighter pens seem to dissolve the dried ink. Periodically, during printing jobs, including the first page, the printer goes through some internal activity that can be frustrating when trying to print something quickly."
5,Impressive Printer,"I purchased this printer based on the top Consumers Reports rating it received plus the excellent reviews I've read of Amazon's customers reviews. Believe me, all the good comments about this printer are right on. It has worked perfectly and prints outstanding documents. I have not yet ventured into printing photo prints, but with the recent purchase of a digital camera, I am confident it will produce the excellent results I expect. Without hestitation, I endorse all the 5 star ratings this printer has received. Purchase with confidence."
2,Cycling,"El título del CD me confundió, ya que estaba necesitando un CD para hacer bicicleta fija (spinning), y resultó ser un trio de lo mas aburrido.No me gustó para nada.Roberto (Montevideo, Uruguay)"
4,"Good, but not great","Iggy's latest CD is a mixed bag. The songs with the Stooges are awesome old school rock. They rock hard and are worthy of the Iggy Pop name. The collaberations with Peaches, Green Day and Sum 41 are also very good. While not ""old school"" rock, the songs Iggy does with these bands/people are fast and very good.His songs with the Trolls fall flat though. They are boring and lifeless. Fortunately, there are only 5 tracks on the Cd with the Trolls. The rest of the CD is pretty good. Worth picking up if you are a fan of the Doors or other old rock. While hardcore Iggy fans might be more than a little disgusted that Iggy teamed up with Sum 41 and Green Day, don't let that deter you from buying this album. The songs with the Stooges alone are good enough to warrant the purchase of Skull Ring."
1,A snuff flick approach to a classic album,"If the artists could sing (they can't - they're almost to a man completely atonal), if they had any familiarity with, or understanding of, the music (they don't - many melodies are unrecognizable), and if they performed the music with more than a 30 second rehearsal (they didn't even prepare that much), this album would still the musical equivalent a snuff flick.The artists must be a culling of crack heads from the recording studio's back lot. Many of the songs are unrecognizable, and the ""minimalist"" arrangements are not even up to the level of simply strumming the chords.Thank God for the two instrumentals - at least no one ""sings"" on those.The only vocal on this album worth even the first listen was Sloop John B, and that is nothing more than a simple campfire folk rendition.I hope by now that you get my drift - this album is the musical equivalent of an enema. If Amazon allowed a zero star rating, even that would be too much."
5,POLITICAL THRILLER WITH A RAZORS EDGE,"""A Political thriller with a razors edge . . . The First Lady plotting to take over the country? You won't put it down--Lots of fun."""
3,"Good Read, But . . .","The plot requires the reader to suspend belief beyond reason. Smart, ruthless politicians that are the at the same time clueless -- how does that work for you? I will still read her next book when it comes out and I hope that she continues to write and improve."
1,Capital Offense,Just a terribly boring book. Don't waste your time there is nothing interesting about this garbage. Awful! Thriller? It's the best sleeping pill you could buy.
4,It DOES work with iPod Classic,"Since someone who reviewed this product stated that this doesn't work with iPod Classics, I felt compelled to correct his/her error. I ordered it for my iPod Classic and it works perfectly."
2,"Works, but poorly made.",The remote functions well but the plastic is pretty flimsy. The clip on the remote broke off after only a few weeks of use. The receiver is too big to use on a Nano.
3,"It's ok, but needs a pass through connector.","I ended up buying another remote with a pass-through dock connector, because I realized I needed to have a charger, or a Sik Imp cable connected to the iPod while the remote was plugged in.The remote itself works from about 150 feet away, and on different levels of the house.I probably won't ever buy another one without the pass-through connector though."
3,Remote Function Good - Quality Not,"I received this item very quickly. It broke just as quickly. The remote has a tab like a belt clip on the back. When I pressed to open, the hinge on the remote broke and the metal spring fell off. The plastic is too small to glue/repair. Unfortunately, this clip is needed to hold the remote in the cradle. I would be concerned the hinges would break while in the cradle. If not in a car (bicycle, motorcycle, etc), the remote would be lost. The receiver does not work if the iPod is in the hard plastic case. I do not own any other cases. As a remote, it works great."
1,Total Crap,I've purchased a total of 4 of these items. The first was 3 or 4 years ago not long after they became available and it worked well. I was totally happy with it. I bought the 2nd one for a friend about 4 months ago and I don't know if his worked or not. My 3rd purchase was to replace my original (I lost one of the components) and it not only broke (plastic is getting old and brittle) but didn't work either. WTG replaced that one with the one in my posession now. I just threw it in the waste basket because it doesn't work either. I did change the batteries in the last 2 to see if that was the cause. No joy. Do not buy this product. They are junk!Bob
4,exactly what i was looking for...,Easy to use- just plug in and go. I use this:on my motorcycle- I used the holder and velcro strap included - attached it to my handlebars. With the large buttons it is easy to control the ipod even with gloves on.In my house- I use it to control my ipod attached to my stereo. Only drawback - they say it works up to 60 feet- seems to only work up to about 30 feet away.
4,"Easy read, well researched, and accurate.","Traquair utilizes a number of contemporary sources--both English and Scottish--to accurately reconstruct Robert Bruce's ambitious grab for the Scottish throne. Traquair also has a fine grasp of politics, the motives of all the key figures, and an understanding of the strategies that worked and the ones that failed. If you want to know not just WHAT happened, but WHY, this is the right book for you."
4,"Straightforward, written with a definite point of view","This book is straightforward, written with a definite point of view, and upon occasion absolutely hilarious. If you enjoy reading MFK Fisher and Angelo Pellegrino and respect the body of work of Julia Child, Simca, Richard Olney and James Beard, you will probably enjoy this book.As the title indicates and Ms David notes, this is bourgeoise food; it is not haute cuisine. It is not fussy or esoteric and Ms David has approached it accordingly.The value of this book as a traditional cookbook will depend on the skills, experience and the mood of the cook. However, the book does provide an overview of regional bourgeois cuisine which, when combined with the small paperback format, makes it an excellent travel book. There is also an exceptional bibliography."
1,Yuck! Inedible.,"Length:: 0:18 MinsThese candies arrived in inedible condition. I don't know what was done to the bars, but the chocolate is dry and crumbly and the filling is hard and unpleasant-tasting. I've eaten Lion bars before and loved them. The bars I received do not taste as they should."
1,Short on shelf life.,I have always enjoyed the Lion bar but will not risk buying again as they are stale. Would not recommend purchase.
1,Disappointing,"Among the load of general knots books currently available (andone might wonder at why there are so many, and so much alike!?),this one comes up way short. Like the others, it has some majormistakes; but unlike them, it hasn't a lot else to offer, and isfairly limited in coverage. Either of Des Pawson's attractivebooks, and the Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots by Geoffrey Budworth,will provide a much better introduction to knots. For a focus onpractical knotting, Clyde Soles's Outdoor Knots is good--with agreat overview of modern cordage materials!"
2,Disappointing,"The range on the phone is less than I had expected it might be. Also, I have had a number of problems with the phone's drivers. I have a new Windows XP setup and more often than not the phone will not respond when I have incoming skype calls. I frequently have to restart my computer to make a call. This is one of those first generation products that probably will get better. One hopes, at least, since it's a good idea."
3,"Will not fit all 17"" laptops","I bought this because I have problems with my back and to carry my heavy laptop and my books. It will work fine but the case does not fit my laptop. That being said, my laptop is not a normal notebook. I have a gaming computer for doing engineering work and design. Remember this will not fit all 17 inch screen laptops.Thanks"
4,Helpful.,"Although this book is rather machine-specific, I found that it had some good advice for the beginning machine quilter. It was a little technical and I had to really study it rather than just read through it, but it was helpful in the long run. It would be the perfect guide for the quilter who owns a Gammil quilting machine."
3,For Manually Guided Quilting,"This book is helpful for those who want to manually guide quilting. It has no information on using the computer to place designs for a longarm machine, such as my HandiQuilter ProStitcher. It has good tips for starting a quilting business."
4,Nice Kid's Bible,Bought this as a gift for a baby's baptism... the only downside was that there was really no place to write a little message from the family... the inside of the cover is the first page!
3,A good collection,"For anyone who can remember what REALLY started the video game market, this is a collection of those pioneering games that were so fun and addictive. Activision has provided 30 games originally for the Atari VCS (2600) and has kept them fairly well preserved.There were a few noticeable problems however. Games like Kaboom! which use the analog paddle control are impossible. The lightning-fast paddle controller is ill-represented by the PS D-pad. Also, the sounds seem to be from the lower-pitched PAL chips, rather than the higher NTSC. Similarly, some of the graphics seem to vary a bit from the originals. Of course, being that I still own a VCS, I can point out these differences.Overall, this isn't a bad buy. For anyone who doesn't have an Atari VCS around but still would love to play their old favorites, this is going to be just right for you. For those in the other category, it may be better to stick with your VCS; nothing feels quite the same as the originals."
2,Measure of a lady,"I gave this 2 stars for the history. Other than that, it was predictable and the character of Rachael was just annoying. I didn't realize this was a ""christian book"", otherwise I never would have bothered."
3,Worst Gist Book to Date,"I have read all of Deanne Gist's novels and have loved all of them. This one is by far my least favorite. I found it to be quite dull and boring. The main character lacks any redeeming qualities and is at best an unlikable prude. I realize that people of that time subscribed to a much different set of values than mainstream America does today. However, Rachel was so extreme, I found it difficult to even tolerate her. This book also lacked much of the humor that Gist's other novels have had. Johnnie's character could have been wonderful without the extra weight of Rachel and her incessant religious/proper this and that yammering. I found the entire Van Buren family to be uninteresting and unlikable."
1,No Secrets here!,"I have W98 Secrets and Linux Secrets which are good books. NT Secrets is worthless. The Secret is that there are no Secrets in this book. If you remove material from the book that doesn't deal with NT or is just NT marketing, you lose about 75% of the book. The little material left is nothing that you couldn't get from normal documentation. If you are looking to get any in-depth knowledge of NT, this book is not the one to get."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!,"We are quite amazed that this was even released with as many errors and outright OMMISSIONS as it had!! It was ridiculous! Some of the chapters towards the end of the book ""featured"" illustrations that didn't match the text at all. Also, some text referred to illustrations that didn't exist etc... This is the absolute WORST ""Secrets"" book we have ever purchased. We still intend to pursue getting our money back for this fiasco."
2,Disappointing,"I'll start off by saying that I'm a big Tindersticks fan, and that I've loved most of their albums (with the exception of ""Can our Love""). However, when I first listened to ""Waiting for the Moon"" I felt really disappointed. It seems flat, uninspired, and the band seems to be working in all too familiar territory. Gone is the passion and force behind such albums as ""Tindersticks 2"" and ""Curtains"". There are a few good tracks on this album, (""say goodbye to the city"") but I'm beginning to think that the band may have peaked."
4,no oblivion,"Sometimes, one song is enough to justify and glorify an album. This is the case with the latest 'Tindersticks'. ""My oblivion"" carries you away, it takes you deep inside and brings you back out of yourself, you could listen to it over and over and over again. But of course, this is only my opinion..."
1,Falling Apart at the Seams...,"After a few washings (to get the ""fuzz"" out), I've noticed these towels are coming apart at the seams. They are getting holes that are growing with each wash. I had assumed I would have these towels for at least a year or two. I am dissappointed as it won't be long before it's time for new towels again."
1,bad deal,"There's only one in the box, it doesn't work with any accuracy, eats batteries like popcorn and frusterated the kids more than it entertained them."
4,Contrary to all others,"I loved this book. It's the first Shannon Drake novel I've ever read, but I immediately loved both Finn and Megan. I liked the depth between them and the way the author kept us guessing who was really the satanists.The first part did drag a bit, but once you get towards the end you realize there was a reason she had to tell the backstory, and a reason for the tension between the two main characters.I hope to see more of Finn and Megan and definitely advise anyone looking for a good mystery with some romance to pick this up and read it."
3,The Awakening,This book was moderately all right. I felt it was a little slow in getting down to the relevant details. I like a few clues on the way to solving a good mystery. Shannon Drake is a good writer though and this gets me through the story.
2,a disappoinment,Normally a huge Shannon Drake fan - this book dragged on. Contrary to another reviewer I didn't start to enjoy the book until some familiar characters came back into play. The main charcaters in this book did not have enough to carry this story on their own. This was a big let down.
1,Hard to follow.,"I bought this because of the rave reviews. Unfortunately, I had not read the book referred to on the CD, and I just could not understand the author's verbal instructions without diagrams. She also uses jargon that I did not know. All-in-all this CD is a waste of time unless, I suppose, you can arrange a private lesson or spend a lot of time reading the book beforehand."
4,Quick read wish it was longer,"Excellent read Milo Milton Quaife did a nice job on filling many facts, the only problem I had was with Mr. Carson wish he would of writtn more. Good read on airline flight."
1,Dirty Bubblegum Pop. 0/10,"This is one of the worst songs ever made. It has no meaning and is an excuse for N sync to score another hit.The only reason they sell records is because girls find the guys hot, the N Sync fans dont listen to the quality of the music they just like it because they find the boys hot. N Sync is a total waste in the music business they are all ..."
5,Perfect for my needs!,The design is cute with the palm trees and it is perfect size to hold my keys. I have gotten many compliments on it. Would recommend it.
4,Beautiful,"I purchased a lot of Palm themed items for a remodel. The remodel is still ongoing, however everything I purchase came fast and was affordable."
1,Horrible Quality,"I had to wait almost three weeks to receive this DVD. When I finally received it, I could not believe the horrible picture quality. This was like a home movie gone awry. I don't know if I was more disappointed or mad! Don't buy!!!"
4,Fun for the young!,"This game is definitely geared for younger children. Any child over 6 would find unchallenging after a few rounds. My three year old loves this game though. Only one person can play and there are only a few levels of play. For the cost of this game, it would be a great purchase for children that never get tired of playing the same thing over and over and don't really care about advancing to upper levels. The graphics are good and music is o.k. You do need a controller pak for saving info too."
2,Not the best game i've ever played...,"Pros: This game has good graphics, is somewhat entertaining, and get's kids interested because it is a character from a movie, so they have probably seen it before. This game is especially good for kids 7-teenCons: Kids younger than 7 might have trouble with this game. I mean, i'm 12 and I had trouble with it after a while. It is extremely easy for the first, maybe, 4 or 5 levels, and then after that, it gets so diffucult that it gets to the point where you're just running around not knowing what to do and getting killed along the way by vicious bugs. If you like a lot of frustration, get this game because it is really cheap(literally). A board game is more expensive, but at least you dont get THAT frustrated."
5,Great Book,"Read this with our leadership team at church. Although I do not understand golf, this book was very good. The book was also in excellent condition."
3,Help for hearing issue,This item works well but I feel it could be improved. The sound quality could be better. I purchased this unit to replace one I purchased at Radio Shack. The ear protection is excellent in view of the fact I have a hearing problem it does a great job. That is probably why I have some problems understanding. The other issue that would improve this unit would be ability to pre-set radio stations or at least some way to find stations. You sort of have to fish for them.
2,A sad joke.,"She gets points for effort, enthusiasm, and embracing ""fitness at any size."" The workout, however, was just no good. Kim Lyons has much better options for people who are just getting started after years of not exercising."
3,"Great start, horrible ending!!!","This book had me on the edge of my seat. The true story about this man butchering his wife nearly made me sick.Everything about this book was great except the ending.If the trial ended in 1994, and the book came out in 2000, then why is there no update like what is going on now? Is Edward Gingerich out of prison, is he with his kids, does he still live with the Brownhill Amish? I think the author should have taken into account that the readers might want an ending to the story not an ending to the trial!!!"
4,captivates the reader from cover to cover,The story itself is of interest as very few Amish commit crimes to begin with. The book can get into some specific detail about the crime itself. I couldnt put it down. Shocking book.
1,iPod Case is nice however .....,"I thought the iPod carrying case looked great and I was happy with it however about a week later I saw marks on my iPod and returned it for a full refund. The case left scratch marks on the side of my iPod and marks on the side of the screen! It's true what my friends said about it ... ""the case is not worth the price"" ... but I had to see for myself. I guess you can say I learned the hard way. But the bright side was they forced me to get a iskin exo from iskin.com. BOY was I sooooo excited when I received it a few days later and it's great!!! There's different color cases and even glow in the dark cases as well! It's hard to describe it in words you just have to see for it yourself. It's way better than the iPod carrying case in that it's cheaper and has a soft touch when it wraps around your iPod and will not leave a scratch!"
1,A Bit Over Ambitious,"This album is a cult favorite within a sector of the band's fan-base. You either love it or not. My theory tends to be that if you like Jethro Tull and other progressive rock groups where concept albums are the norm, you'll probably enjoy it. If you find those kinds of projects boring and pretensious, you should probably avoid it. Aside from Gottle of Geer, I'm comfortable recommending ANY other Fairport record over this one. Had it been the only album the band ever made, it certainly would have merited a better grade than the one given here. However, given the band's output, both prior and after Lee, it pales by comparison."
2,GRAVE MATTERS,"Totally preposterous movie with a couple of hilarious scenes. Tony Todd shimmys and shakes in an over the top performance as the fanatical reverend--a Jamie Foxx/Cuba Gooding impersonation..a real hoot. Equally hilarious is the scene where the bound sisters hiss and claw at each other after smelling the demon! This movie is actually in two parts..the first a slasher set in a deserted silver mine; the other set in the town of Unity, kind of a CHILDREN OF THE CORN parody.The Horrorfest series is usually a lot better!"
1,Unfocused mess...,"...and it wasn't even a good unfocused mess. I love horror movies, and I'm not terribly picky, but this really didn't have anything going for it. It wasn't well written, and the acting was sub-par. The worst part, though, was that it couldn't figure out what kind of movie it wanted to be. Let the record show, it is possible to be way too ambitious. They could've gone the crazy murderous rednecks route, but decided to throw in a crazy religious cult angle, and just for good measure, a smelly demon. It tried to be funny in places and fell flat every time, the suspenseful scenes weren't, and I was waiting for it to be over from about an hour in. Not even Tony Todd could save this one."
3,Prog-metal for fans of Journey and Dream Theatre,"Progressive-metal outfit Stride is readying their second album to be distributed among anyone who enjoys their metal soaked in technical riffage and melodic high-pitched vocals. That's right I said vocals. After releasing their first album as an instrumental band, the group finally settled on a singer in Gary Belin in '04 and set about to record a righteous record of heavy metal as the total package. Fans of Journey, Dream Theatre, and Kansas will be heads over heels in love with Stride's ""Imagine""-an album so technical it should come with a manual."
2,"It smells awesome, but some things matter more than others. . .","I used the Aveda R.M. shampoo and followed with this Aveda R.M. conditioner. My hair always felt like straw even before I could get out of the shower! It was absolutely killing my hair. It's too bad, because I LOVE the way it smells, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Aveda products are usually very good to me, so I am quite disappointed that this didn't work out."
3,not that great of a vehicle shooter,"Vigilante 8 is not a good vehicle shooter at all. The graphics and sound are the only good things about it. The control ruins the game, you can't make real tight turns or spin on a dime like you can in other vehicle shooters I've played. I was real disappointed after I played a few rounds of this game. The weapon choice is good and the levels are imaginative, but the control just ruins everything else. The fun factor and replay value are completely ruined by the sorry control.If you want to play a great vehicle shooting game, buy Twisted Metal 2 for the Playstation. If you must play Vigilante 8, just rent it."
4,"Great resource: Use this one, don't leave it gathering dust.","This book is a simple, thorough, engaging manual of methods people can easily apply immediately to market their business. What I most appreciate are the many unusual ideas - and the passion Griffiths uses as he makes suggestions to the reader.He has a very engaging, friendly style which any reader would enjoy - it is as if he is sitting beside you, cheering your efforts.This is one of those books that belongs on the shelf of any business. Those with a limited marketing budget or a SOHO will find it especially helpful."
2,Hateful and Biased,Dont waste your time with this trype. The authors are anti-monachist and The contempt for the Romonavs is fairly eveident. I thought monarch bashing went out of style with the advent of WWII. The mistakes and tribulations of The Romanovs are well known. A history more focused on the surviving family and less politically Biased would have been refreshing.
4,Please write a Sequel!!!,"There is this Jewish boy named Daniel, who lived in the holocaust time. The story starts out with him going through his pictures from the past while he is on a train with his family going to a ghetto. Before the holocaust Daniel had a wonderful life. But then Hitler issued for all Jewish people to wear something that lets everyone know that you were Jewish. When they get to the ghetto everything starts to go wrong.I like this book. It was very exciting and some what scary. It was scary because of everything he went through. You don't think about how it was back then. But overall it was a great book if you like a book about the sadness and realness of a story. I could not put this book down."
5,The most powerful book of its kind,"I am a paraprofessional who works in a fifth grade class. In my spare time in the classroom I pick out books from the class library to read. I picked this book up yesterday and finished it today and can only say that I was overwhelmed. I have never read any other book in my entire life on this subject that allowed the reader to actually feel the horror, terror, and despair along with the determination and hope that Daniel shared in his writings. While the book is fiction, it personifies what happened in a way that I never imagined, even after having visited both Holocaust Museums. (in Washington,DC and in NYC) I have five granddaughters aged 9 through 16. I will make sure each of them reads this book."
2,Get real,"The real keewaydin is in temagami Ontario. Much like Disney, Mike went to the pretend camp, all hat, no cattle."
5,Good Stuff - You have to read the instructions,"I just finished a big desk project and was very pleased with the results. Because this is not a common stain, you cant apply it the same way. You need a good natural brush, you need to apply pre-stain, and you need to apply in thin coats because the mix thickens as it drys. I hear everyone complaining about it running which it will do if you use too much. And those blotches and uneven stains are because you didnt use pre-stain, which it clearly tells you on the can that will happen if you dont pre-stain.Again im very pleased with the quality and results. I plan on doing more projects with the product."
5,Great Manga,"Odviously u would have to have read the gundam seed manga or watched the show to understand the background. But all in all this is a great, well written manga with great drawings and much better characters than the show in my opinion. It also explains some plotholes from the show, like the unexplained event with kira's escape from death for instance. I highly reccommend this manga for all gundam fans."
2,Didn't work for my son,I prayed these would work as my son is teething horribly but he might have well had water. it had absolutely no effect.
5,Fabulous,"I was introduced to Irene Grandi by an Italian friend and I am so very thankful that he did! It is a real shame that the only people to read this review, or buy her cds, will be those who have already heard of Irene. She is one of the most popular Italian artists, and has an amazing voice, a pop voice with a hint of gravel! Very sexy.I dont speak Italian, but her music is so catchy, innovative and interesting that it doesnt matter. I defy you not to sing along - even if you DONT speak Italian!This is either a great introduction to Irene's music, or a great cd to complete your Irene collection.Buy it, take that chance and discover a fantastic artist."
5,Best Brass Christmas music!,"Bought this years ago on cassette. It is one of my all time favorites. The harmonies are wonderful. I love the feel good/ upbeat Jingle Bells version. Not all the songs are traditional Christmas songs here, but there is not a clinker in the bunch. Great mood/backround music for any Christmas gathering. If you like instumental Christmas music you can't go wrong with this one!!"
4,Full groove all the way,"For people who want to buy a full groove album perfectly mix, here is one for you. For global underground it is kind of a new sound. The first CD is right on the groove. The is no introduction and you feel the beat right at the beginning. The second CD is much more funky and it is the pecfect mix before hitting the dance floor.It is not cheasy house music like you use to listen on radio. Darren Emerson have a winning formula with that album. It his house music at is best .Bravo"
2,A big disapointment,"I had high hopes for this book, but I was very disappointed. The story itself was not a bad one - but there really didn't seem to be a need for the main character to be vampire - other than to increase the erotic vein of the story. Borrow it - don't buy it."
4,Anne Rice meets Architectural Digest,"I won't belabor the plot points so neatly laid out by Mr. Dietz's other 30 reviewers (ironically, those offering the most neatly laid plot summaries seem to have it out for the author, or maybe they just don't like vampires, or maybe they're just no fun), but as a die-hard Anne Rice fan in my teen years, Desmond was a terrific journey back to that time, when vampires were moody and romantic and elegant and didn't sit next to you in biology class. From what I know of the author's professional background, his work in the decorative arts has clearly laid the foundation for his novel, which contains as many vivid descriptions of the odd 18th century end table as it does descriptions of the protagonist's method of blood-letting. Reading the book on the train every morning made me want to go to a museum as much as it made me wonder what kind of gay vampire *I'd* be. Vampires, gay sex, antique furniture AND a murder mystery plot twist make this a solid, fun read."
2,This book should be renamed,"The title of this book is very misleading as has very little marketing content.But the book would be a perfect read for anyone thinking of starting up a small business as it covers a lot of basics fundamentals.For marketing insperation, this book does not cut it."
4,SHake N Bobbles,These are pretty cute little toys that my 2 1/2 yo loves to play with. He throws them a bit and they are holding up pretty well. They are adorable!
5,So Cute!,"We got these toys when they were on clearance on amazon.com. They were larger than we expected. The bobble heads are cute and the little ""rides"" are cute."
2,Lousy,"Master Testa pioneered public teaching knife combatives in Brazil a decade ago or so, and is to be commended by that, being that many others chose to stay underground with their teachings. But the material here presented is lousy at best, and, like much of what is taught in Brazil on knife combatives, nonsense fantasy. Knowing that there are better material in Brazil concerning the subject than what is actually being distributed and made available abroad, I'd advise you to keep your money with you. Better times will come, eventually."
3,It's okay,"I love all of the Franklin books. I ordered this book because the activity pages sounded like fun. However, upon receiving it, the puzzles have been written in, and I think iot would be disappointing to my grandchild.."
5,Delightful!,"I bought this book out of sheer curiosity, and am I glad I did! Of course it is somewhat dated, but the main ideas are still as relevant as ever. It talks about many things I never would have thought could be fascinating, and it does so in a lighthearted, non-preachy manner without dumbing concepts down. I now plan to buy the rest of Mr. Gould's essay series."
3,Dream Life Fun but....,"Dream Life is a fun game don't get me wrong but this game has some errors.1. You don't see your self doing things2. you dont see your parents or dog3. when you go to partys or dances all you do is talk to people(and you dance with your boyfriend if you have one but you don't see that)4. you can't do your job(if you get one)5.School is like 2 sec.6.you can't wach TV or play the video game console(in the game)7.you say stuff that doesn't really happen(like I'm getting a new puppy or I'm gatting a new room)But this game has some good stuff to1.When you do chores you gat a LOT of money2.you can have a lot of friends3.you can shop(which i luv to do)4.you can go to partys and dances and meet new friends5. you can sign up for activities(like soccer,softball,chearleading etc)well thats my review I hope you like reading it"
3,it's ok. . . .,"When I saw this game, I REALLY wanted it. I used all my report card money and bought it. It was not worth the 30 dollars I paid for it. I finished this game in 2 days. I was confused at first and missed the Fall Dance and a party. And you get like 40 bucks for sweeping, and you don't even do it, you just click on it. The days are like 2 minutes long. I started the game over, and there were new people. But, the last time I played, when I beat it in 2 days, I think I was just going too fast. All I did was, chores, school, (you don't even do school, it just says, 'School was usual' or something like that), home, homework, work on tests, mall, an activity, and, that was the day. All you do is click. So if you do get this game, I would talk longer with friends and go to the mall more often to get more points. I don't recomend this game."
5,Great toy for girls,My 7 1/2 year old played this at a friends house and fell in love with it. We bought it for her for Christmas and she loves it. Our daughter is really shy and I thought this would be great for her to learn about life choices and how to communicate better. I also see it as a reading tool. She has to read and learn to navigate her way around. Great toy!
4,totally fun!,"I have Dreamlife and it ROCKS!!! You can go to school, the mall,salon,rec center,your BFF's home,and your home.Each game is 90 days,but school days are only like 3 min.and weekends are like up to 5 min depending how long you do stuff.Another thumbs-down is that parties and dances are stupid.I mean all you can do is talk,talk,TALK!!And when you get a computer all you can do is study and IM a friend.but other than that it's SOOOOO much fun! So don't just sit there!BUY IT!!!!"
1,This game is a travesty of a dream,"I'm sure that this toy is ""fun"" for some people.HOWEVER, I think that it is PATHETIC and DISGUSTING that a company has been allowed to create and advertise a toy that ENCOURAGES young girls to PRETEND to be something that they are not. They are suggesting that it's perfectly normal for girls to take part in virtual activities (making friends, extracurricular activities, going to school, playing sports) when they should be taking part in these activities in their REAL LIVES.PARENTS: PLEASE DO THE RIGHT THING and encourage your children to make their dreams come true within their REAL lives. This may mean giving up some luxuries like having them appear the way YOU want them to (their ""dream"" may be to dye their hair blue) but if it means that they will GO OUT INTO THE WORLD and BE THEMSELVES and try their best and not sit around on the couch all day, IT WOULD BE WORTH IT IN THE LONG RUN."
4,Nice Product!,"I really like the matte effect after applying, great instant result! But it tends to absorb the moisturizer as well and dried up my skin a little bit. Overall, this is a great product! Just remember to apply more moisturizer on your skin before applying this product!"
4,Comfortable .,"The rubber cores , frame and nosepiece are comfortable although the inward sloping lenses take a little getting used to . A bit pricey compared to Ztek Readers or products from MSA and other safety apparatus suppliers."
5,I use these every day at work......,"These glasses are great. I own a shop repairing and building musical instruments. I am at a point where my contacts are no longer adequate for close up work. Prior to getting these, I was forced to choose between wearing reading glasses and being able to see of wearing safety glasses and protecting my eyes. These are durable, and enable me to see and be safe at the same time. Several friends have asked me about the glasses, also being unaware that bifocal safety glasses were available. The protective sleeve is also nice, as it is difficult to find a case to fit wrap around glasses."
2,Well built but bad optics,"I am a 51 year old controls engineer needing a pair of safety glasses for using my laptop PC in an industrial environment. These Dewalt glasses are well built and comfortable but the magnification areas of the lenses are in the wrong location for my liking. They are situated too low and not large enough. They would be ok if all you were doing were reading a book, but when working in an industrial control cabinet or on a laptop, they are unsuitable. For example, the keyboard is in the magnification area but the screen is not. I will instead look for a pair that magnifies over the entire lens. The protective sleeve that comes with these glasses works well.October 2011 update: I have purchased a pair of VS Eyewear, clip-on 0.75x full-lens magnifiers to clip-on to these Dewalt safety glasses. A bit bulky, but it works. I now get the magnification that I need across the entire lens of the safety glasses."
4,Good Product - Good Price,"The DeWalt 1.5 mags work well and are fairly priced. I've been using similar products for years and it reallly helps for close work like mitering. If I could change anything on these it would be to make the ""cheater"" section a little bigger which would help a lot with overhead jobs like ceiling wiring (need yoga to get your neck tipped back far enough). Also, for me, I wish the frames were a narrower - they are a little loose. Great for the fatheads you work with though. Overall, good product & highly recommended."
3,Protective Bifocals Dewalt,These glasses are light and comfortable to wear. But the wrap around style is problematical. When you are bending over and looking at work your eyes will have difficulty focusing on the work because The difference between the magnifier part and the distortion of the unmagnified area of the curved lens is slightly disorienting. You will have to move your head rather than your eyes to see the work. I did not have this problem with the Uvex old style glasses. They are farily flat lenses and have side shields. Now the old style Uvex are more ugly and the bifocal spot was about 1/16th to high for me. None of these things are going to be great until the opticians begin stocking safety glasses and you can get a custom job.Ya pays ya money and ya makes ya choice.
5,Dewalt DPG59-115C Reinforcer Rx-Bifocal 1.5 Clear Lens High Performance Protective Safety Glasses with Rubber Temples and Protec,These Are Great Safety Glasses When You're Working Close Up And At A Distance. Great Fit. Great Product For The Price.
4,"her first, her best","in my book, this one stands out among the subsequent albums she released. one:her trademark soaringly high register is used here and she sounds best this way.two: it's produced by michael chapman,one of the best in the business. three:it's engineered by another michael:michael tretow and he knows best how to bring those powerful pipes out.the two tracks i wouldn't wrap my arms around? ""mr persuasion"" (it don't move me sweetie) and ""stand by my side"""
2,Agnetha at her worst,"Okay. Agnetha's first album was number one in UK or whatever, but I think that this is just another Abba album ...I love the catchy song: I Can't Shake Loose (No 65 UK), Wrap Your Arms Around Me (No 45 UK), Man, and Take Good Care of Yor Children. After this album, Agnetha produced some better work which were never released as a single in UK. A very disapointing album, and it was recorded with an excellent producer-engineer too quickly (from the first recording to the release was 5 months!)."
2,A waste of money,There was only one story that was interesting to watch unfold the rest I didn't like they were boring not entertaining at all a waste of money and time.
2,Boring and not worth the money,I wish I could have my money on this movie. It was really bad. The stories were not that interesting.I do not recommend you spending your hard earned money on this one.
3,not as good as old albums,"Spirit of old MMEB is almost gone.More it is like tipical 80's pop-rock.Kind of dissapoitment,but not totally."
4,How to Think about Style,"Thomas and Turner offer a provocative approach to writing style. This is not a manual or reference book that you can consult for simple directions on correcting grammar or streamlining sentences. Instead, the authors examine the fundamental questions that underlie the stylistic choices we make. (For example, what is the nature of truth? what is the relationship between language and the truth?) The book focuses on the style they call ""classic prose,"" but they also describe (and give both good and bad examples of) other prose styles, and they are honest about the shortcomings of classic prose and the situations when other styles are better suited to the purpose of writing. The book would be more useful if there were more direct discussion of how specific surface features of an example relate to the author's philosophical stance, but it is a rewarding and thought-provoking text that may well change how you think about writing."
4,Awesome Pokemon adventures return,"I got this box set because I played pokemon ever since I was 4 or 5. I still play and I watch the diamond and pearl whenever it comes on. I missed the first few (5) seasons of pokemon on tv, so I started a collection of dvds(this being the first.) The episodes are great but the menu lacks special features and there is no japenese track. I always have to keep the remote in my hand because the theme song comes on twice an episode (and if I want to skip through the team rocket intro that appears in every episode.) The cases of the three dvds feel very flimsy and breakable. The outside cardboard is nice though and you dont get a dvd for its case so thats nothing to complain about. Seeing the episodes in order was great and if you're a fan of pokemon I suggest that you go to walmart, or any other store, and get these episodes today."
1,Not what it looks like,This was advertised as box set of season one and looks like a great deal but it is not the full season 1 only episodes 1-26
3,Original US Release version only!!!!!,My daughter really enjoys watching Pokemon and so when I saw this item listed with Japanese and subtitles I ordered it. We received the item today and what a let down. AMAZON HAS THIS ITEM LISTED WRONG. THIS IS THE ORIGINAL US RELEASE VERSION AND DOES NOT HAVE SUBTITLES AND JAPANESE LANGUAGE TRACK. We will still keep the product since Pokemon is such a great show for kids. But someone at Amazon should do their homework next time. I checked other web sites and they only list the English track for this set.
2,New to Bollywood? There are better films to see...,"I could watch Shahrukh Khan all day, everyday, but not in this movie. The first half is ridiculously out-dated and over-acted. In fact, it is hard to watch. I kept thinking it would get better, or I kept hoping it would speed up through the ridiculous parts- but the ridiculous parts were the whole first half and it did not speed up. The second half concentrates too much on the little daughter and there is too little of Shahrukh. It also went on and on. Although this movie was a big success when it came out, I would put it at the end of my list for watching - even below ""Yes, Boss"", if that is possible!! Watch Dil Se, Don, Kal Ho Na Ho, Khabi Kushi Khabi Gam, or my favorite, Khabi Alvida Na Kehna!!! Now THESE are Shahrukh at his best, with well-acted scenes and interesting story lines and dialogue!"
3,good concepts but insubstantial,"This book was recommended to me after I practically memorized ""Intuitive Eating"" by Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch. I agree strongly with the premise of this book, that restrictive dieting will wreck your body and life, but the book itself is half full of lined pages (for doing the journal exercises) and not very much substantial argument / explanation. The exercises might be helpful to you if this is your first exposure to the idea of non-dieting, but the style of the book is very unsophisticated, gimmicky self-help; ""naturally thin"" is italicized wherever it appears in the text. I found it very off-putting. I really recommend reading Intuitive Eating instead of Diets Don't Work -- much longer and much better discussion, much more helpful."
4,Excellent book purchased for my wife's birthday. She has enjoyed it.,Excellent book purchased for my wife's birthday. She has enjoyed it. Excellent book purchased for my wife's birthday. She has enjoyed it.
5,My family's favorite TV show: even Grandpa likes it.,"Naruto has great music, terrific graphics, fascinating characters, interesting plots, and educational stories. Even the minor characters and villains are sympathetic and multi-dimensional. My seven year old sons and their seventy year old grandfather watch it every afternoon. Getting the boxed set allows me to watch the shows with the boys any time we wish. The six CD set is great and we are on our second viewing."
4,Can Finally Afford It,"I was dying to have Naruto, but could never afford it because it is a popular series. Now that I can, I've fallen into a deeper addiction of it. I can't wait for it to finish completely and fill my book shelf with the dvds XD"
2,"Well-written, but only a lust story...","That about sums it up.A disappointing read for both the ""love"" story and the mystery. The mystery I figured out the first time the ""villain"" was introduced, the love story was nonexistent. Both h/h disliked/hated each other through most of the book, yet lustful thoughts (which the author makes us privy to ad nauseum) abound.I could buy that Jonet & Cole wanted to screw each other senseless; what the author NEVER made me believe was that they loved each other.Also, I like strong heroines as much as the next person, but Jonet was just a plain witch. A grown woman throwing temper tantrums? Please. Tossing any object not nailed down and attacking people with riding crops does not denote strength--just hysteria, arrogance and lack of self-control.I will say the hero was a likable fellow. He deserved a better heroine--and a better story."
5,The story of my family if we had money.,The story of my family if we had money. I love this show and will buy the second season just a soon as they release it.
5,Great!,I really enjoy watching this show I can't stop laughing! I just can't wait to watch the next one. I really hope they continue producing the show for many years to come!
5,Love the Ducks!,This was a very easy purchase. I love that I received it instantly and can watch the season over and over whenever I want to.
4,Great,It is a very clean show that I would let my children watch. I thought is way funny. I would recommend to my friends.
4,My favorite sweats,"First, it's great that Under Armour has a fairly complete catalog on Amazon. It used to take a trip to the sporting goods store, but now I can buy online.These are the heavy, thick but breathable fleece sweats, finished to a nice, clean surface on the outside. They're warm, but not so warm that you couldn't wear them outside on an early summer day. They also hold up well from repeated washings...my last pair lasted a very long time, and I suspect these will, too.The fit is slightly on the large side. The elastic waist holds them in place, but there's plenty of room all around.Only small complaint is that they are a bit long for me. Last pair I bought was perfect in length, but these - supposedly the exact same style - are 1-2"" too long for me. Still, overall I'm satisfied and would recommend these to anyone wanting top quality at a fair price."
3,Not what I expected,"I'm 5'8"" & 163lbs and medium was very baggy and too long. I should have known better based on what's in stores."
4,Good fleece,Needed something a little warmer for the cold jogs and this fit the bill. A drawstring at the bottle would have been nice but the warm and the sleekness of the pants makes up for it.
3,Needs a new heroine.,This book just didn't do it for me. I couldn't relate to or like a main character who is convinced that she's in love with and is destined to marry a dashing celebrity that she's never met (she feels that she knows him because she's read about all of his exploits in the tabloids)! It was also pretty unbelievable that Justin (who was definitely more appealing as a character) was in love with Natalie. Not her best work.
5,Classical Guitar for everyone,"The rodrigo concierto is of course fantastic and immediately accesible. The great thing about this disk is that it also provides you with the chance to hear 2 other contemporary classical guitar concertos that are less frequently performed with similar styles by other masters of guitar writing. For [the money} you can't really go wrong. Also, anyone who likes the Miles Davis album ""Sketches of Spain"" owes it to themselves to hear the original composition the first track on that CD is based on. (The adagio. track 2) Again, ... what are you waiting for?"
2,Excellent exits,"I'm so glad the author included a lenghty chapter on various means of escape, because if I ever meet a group of people like the author, I will want to escape from them as quickly as possible.Also, avoid the audio version at all costs. It's painful to listen to."
2,Good and bad advice!,This has some good advice but this also has some advice that I would consider to be very rude and antisocial. She said in the book that it is ok to LIE and spill food on people you do not like. What? That is awful advice!I would not suggest you read or buy this book for that reason. People who don't know any better may not be able to understand that the author is a bit on the eccentric side and doesn't have any real degree in sociology or interpersonal communication; therefore you need to be very critical of her advice.
4,Turns social gatherings into a kind of game.,Humorous - turns social gatherings into a kind of game. Eye-opener.
5,Their greatest album EVER...,This is undoubtely B.J.H's greatest album ever. All songs are great. ROCK N ROLL STAR is one of the best rock songs of all time and all the rest of this album are awesome with the possible exception of RA which i never liked so much. SUICIDE is just epic...etc...If u need to buy just one B.J.M album then THIS IS THE ONE...
5,Great Deal!,I payed twice this price for a container half this size at a local pet store. Just make sure your turtle is old enough or big enough to eat these sticks. They make a size that is more for baby turtles.
4,Good Purchase,I picked this item up because I've read that it is more nutritious than the brand that I was currently using. The pellets float and my turtle eats them without any difficulty. I feel positive about using this brand as a staple in my aquatic turtles diet.
1,Electrocution Rock,"When I was changing the substrate out of my reptile's cage, I notice the wires were a little bit exposed. Without processing what I was doing I pushed the wires back in and POP. The scariest part is that what if he walked over the wires and it electrocuted him? I will never buy another heat rock product."
3,Truly a gift from this photographer,"We recently returned from Tanzania and Serengeti, after seeing this book in the airport in Africa at the start of our trip I could not carry it around for 5 weeks up Mt Kilimanjaro, after returning to Australia and finding it very difficult to get, I am glad that I have found it. A truly lovely piece for the coffee table"
1,Get Real - Just look at Question 8!,"I am a through-n-through athiest, yet I want to understand how the smartest, deepest, most rational thinkers among the believers in Christianity answer questions that seem to show God et al. to be other than loving, knowing, and just. That is what drew me to consider purchasing this book.I didn't expect a balanced or skeptical approach, but to include question 8, ""If I'm still plagued by doubts, then is it still possible to be a Christian?"" as one of the ""8 most convincing arguments against Christian faith"" is simply laughable because it is not an argument at all, is it?I didn't buy the book and you should not either. Instead, read the reviews carefully and select something more intellectual.scottie"
1,Sloppy Journalism,"This book is awful. Lee Strobel interviews philosophers who completely deny the Sovereignty of God, and he completely ignores the Protestant Reformers views on these very same issues. The Philosphers he interviews are so eager to push there views and without even using scripture to back them up, like Peter Kreeft trying, but struggling to answer one of the big eight questions in the book called""Since evil and suffering exist, a loving God cannot."" I think this book would completely confuse the reader. I do not recommend this book and I'm glad that I only checked it out from the library and didn't buy it."
5,Thought provoking,"Lee Strobel was an investigative reporter, an attorney and an Atheist. This book covers his in-depth investigation into whether faith is real or just the imagination of man. When read along with his companion book ""The Case for Christ"" one can hardly deny the conclusion that God does exist and that Jesus was in fact God in human form. In the course of his investigation Lee Strobel became a convert from Atheism to Christianity."
2,Not so talented,"Poorly laid out explanations and a lot of circular logic, and using things as evidence that are themselves unproven. One must understand that quoting from ones own holy book is not evidence to people who do not believe in said holy book's words. Someone that already buys into the religion will love this, but it will not turn the mind of a single skeptic."
4,A must read for the Mature Christian,"In this book, author Lee Stobel, picks out the most prevelent arguments that skeptics will raise, when questioning Christianity, than dispel them not just through scripture, (as most apologetics do), but rather through the techniques of modern analysis. His background as a trained investigational reporter are very evident in his approach, and serve to keep the reader wondering if he is pro or con, due to his efforts to keep his objectivity during his analysis. A must for preparing the mature Christian in defense of his faith, but a wonderful piece of outreach for those seeking Faith in general.Robert James Luedke, (Author...Eye Witness: A Fictional Tale of Absolute Truth)"
3,Case for Faith,"Interesting, yet not quite as compelling as Case for Christ. In the book objection #6 states that the fire or flames in hell are only figurative..if this is the case then the lake of fire is what? If flames are figurative then what else in the Bible is figurative? Go figure. It seems that the book may have been written to quickly, and his sources all seem to have alot of titles and books under their belt. I would have liked to seen more than one point of Christian view on the objections. If he writes another book I'll buy it."
3,Only an Introduction,"As long as you read this book as an introduction to apologetics issues, you should find it to be satisfactory. This seems to be the consensus across the spectrum of reviews about the book. The people who seem to have liked the book don't seem to be too informed about the issues being addressed in it. Those who did not like the book understand that it cannot tackle the issues in-depth.If you want surface answers or an intro to apologetics issues, this book will be helpful.If you're looking for deeper answers to these questions, look to texts written by the people being interviewed in this one and not to the author."
4,Legends of NYHC,"Alongside Leeway's Born to Expire, Age of Quarrel is the greatest hardcore record ever. It's a brutal, in your face assault straight from the gutters of the Lower East Side. After AOQ, the band ventured into more of a metal (crossover) sound, which disappointed many of their fans including myself, but I adjusted quickly with Best Wishes and Alpha-Omega. After years of line-up changes, bickering and fighting between band members Harley and Parris managed to put their differences aside for a minute and released Revenge in 2000. Revenge is well produced and catchy as hell it shows the punk side of the Cro-Mags without losing the hardcore sound or feel, it's a must buy for any fan. Just wish the AOQ line-up would have stuck around for all five releases I'm sure they would have sounded different. Harley sounds great on Revenge but John Joseph has the best voice in hardcore."
4,Pretty Good,"This is a pretty good album if you can pick up a used one pretty cheap. It's nice and soft, good to listen to when you want something relaxing or to sleep by.01. Silent Night02. Joy to the World03. O Holy Night04. Angels We Have Heard On High05. Adeste Fideles06. Away in the Manger07. O Little Town of Bethlehem08. Deck the Halls09. God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen10.

5,A very fine cordless phone,"I used a Uniden cordless for many years but the 2.4 ghz interferance with my in-home Linksys Wireless finally got to the point where I could no longer live with it and had to switch to a 5.8 ghz. I bought Panasonic for no other reason than I had one 20 years ago which fell off the roof of my car while driving along and, after it was taped up, continued to operate flawlessly for many years. This phone has a ton of features, most of which I'll never use, but the one I like the best is that the speakerphone is built into the handset(s) rather than the base unit and switching back and forth is totally seamless with little danger of self-disconnecting. The Answering Machine works fine but is unlike many other machines in the respect that, when you are on ""call screening"", you do not hear your greeting before the calling party speaks."
2,Poor sound quality,"I bought this phone from Amazon one year ago. Great features and good range. I can walk a block away and still use it. However, everyone complains they can't hear me. There is no way to turn up the volume of the microphone. Only the received sound. Very annoying. This is the second Panasonic cordless I have owned that has had poor sound."
4,Part broke too!,Too bad the battery lock part broke! It must be a manufacturing defect. I have seen the same issue on other sites.<br /><br />I received this camera as a Christmas gift from my husband. It is an upgrade from my previous easy share. It is simple to use and takes great photos. The software is user friendly too.<br /><br />Big bang for the buck.<br /><br />I am just disappointed that piece broke. You would think a great company like Kodak would have had that problem figured out before they mass produced them. So sad.
2,Battery Latch,"Great pictures with plenty of light.Not so good pictures in low light.Battery latch broke after 9 months. Too many people are having this problem to be from rough handling. It's from poor engineering/parts design on Kodaks part. (the latch snapped in the section that is less than 1/16"" thick)"
1,It's great...if only the shutter button worked!!,"This is a wonderful camera, but, read on.Just over a year from purchasing this camera, the shutter button stopped working. I took it to a local camera store, who would not look at it; they wanted $225 before they would touch it. I then turned to Kodak, who wanted $135 just to look at it, or, for $199 they would take my camera and send me a ""reconditioned"" camera of a different model (talk about adding insult to injury; send me someone else's lemon!). Such a deal!! So, this really beautiful camera sits in a drawer.Kodak, what happened to your quality??!! A camera should not fail after such a short period of time.My advice, if you want to buy this camera: get the extended warranty."
4,"Where's the Turtee's, Mommy?","My son is 2 years old and has been looking through this book for months. He likes to see all the animals. The ""Turtee"" (Turtle) section is his favortie. I can see he is truly going to enjoy this when he is older. It is very informative and fun."
4,Demonic Depths,"This fast-paced horror-science fiction romp is an exciting and non-stop action story. I enjoy such things, trying to create something of the same mood in Season of the Plant, although I come nowhere near the skill of this author. I have a background in geology, have gone into unexplored caves, and can relate to the excitement and mystery which surround plumbing the depths of our planet. What these explorers discover, however, is a wonderfully amazing and horrifying one. Well described, action to the last page, with primary characters unfortunately flawed (especially the protagonists) which make the book really worthwhile in the long run.As in Ancestor, which I read prior to this work, the author creates a villain who epitomizes all the qualities which create endless concern for others to the very end."
3,EarthGore?,"Earthcore had what seemed to be all the earmarks of a fun and exciting adrenaline-fueled adventure read.But after first reading a new novel called - EVENT - it proves just how good new writers can be. With all due respect to Scott Sigler, he takes way too long to get the story going. After reading such great adventures such as James Rollins's Subterranean and Excavation, Siglar's storytelling comes off long-winded.But, overall, it shows much promise. We will still try out his newest novel - Ancestor."
5,"Great Product, but attachments unnecessary","Boy, this thing really packs a punch! It's pretty strong. The vinyl attachments were useless, though, and I ended up throwing them away."
1,gift from hubby,My husband bought this for me because of the many great reviews but it did nothing for me....might as well just buy a regular back massager from Wal-Mart!
2,DISAPPOINTING!,This book is a novelization of Diane Thomas' wonderful screenplay. It is a shame that it does not capture the same magic as the movie. To be skipped.
1,bad to worse,"I usually don't read fiction...but when my husband and I had a nine hour layover in JFK this book looked interesting. I read this book from cover to cover wondering when it was going to get good...this book is predictable, unsuspensefull, and long!! Save your time and don't read this book!"
3,"Okay,","I read this book via audio, and I'm not sure I would have stuck with it if it was in book form. Some of the writing was pretty sophmoric, very overwrought and repetitive prose,rather amateurish, IMHO.However, there was enough to the story to keep me interested, and the history of the Cathars was enjoyable. Overall, the book would have benefited from some serious editing...not sure who was asleep at the wheel in this publishing house!"
2,Disappointing,"I approached this book with enthusiasm, based on all the hype. Unfortunately, I found a poorly executed version of what could have been a terrific story. Huge plot holes abound- what was with Alice's dream of being pursued to the cliff, wearing the yellow cross? If she was truly dreaming Alais' experiences, then the editor must have left this one out. I enjoyed reading about the Languedoc, and though the French/Occitan smatterings didn't bother me, having a child in 1209 say ""Okay"" absolutely did. Overall, long on possibilities, short on execution."
3,Fun but wait for the paperback,"The Washington Post is my local paper and I've come to know and trust the reviews in the Book World section so when this got a good review (see the post's editorial review above) I went out and bought it. It's not a bad book but I must say I was somewhat disappointed.The plot was decent and there was a lot of interesting historical information about the Cathars. But if you're looking for a heart-racing thriller with a grand finale, this just isn't it. A far better ""women's"" historical thriller is The Eight by Katherine Neville."
1,Very disappointing,"I bought the book to read on a business trip to Toulouse with a chance for a quick visit to Carcassonne. Having always been interested in history, and wanting to read about the Cathars, I looked forward to reading this book. I was vastly disappointed. The plot is very badly executed, suddenly there is talk about the gral. The reader is not led towards finding out about the gral, there is no hints, no real explanation till the end. The idea behind the book is not bad, but the way the book is written was not enjoyable at all."
1,Pointeless novel,"This book is pointless, overlong, under plotted, and is ""much ado about nothing"". Unidimensional characters trapped in a maze of nothingness. For me, it was a stupendous disappointment from start to finish.I kept reading it, expecting (hoping, really) about some kind of development or originality. I'd even welcomed silly plot twists! But you end up with plenty of descriptions of places and things (gotta fill those pages!) and pretty much nothing else.My only consolation is that I did not pay for it.STAY CLEAR OF THAT BOOKThanks.C."
5,Buried history,"Actually this is my second reading of Labyrinth. Several years ago I bought Labyrinth and was spellbound by Mosse's book. The story of the Cathars and their beliefs was destroyed centuries ago by the Christian zealots. Men,women and children were slaughtered for their faith and beliefs.Anyone interested in the evolution of the Christian religion will want to learn about this forgotten chapter. Great writing, great book!"
3,Suspense That Holds Little,"Let's keep it short:If you're looking for the type of book that will keep you up all night with ""just one more chapter"" - this ain't it. Only about a third of this book (sadly scattered throughout) will grab your attention, and really just because you're curious how things will turn out, not because you need to find out how things turn out.If you're looking for the some ""above average"" beach reading - you found it. You can put this book down and pick it up without really missing a beat or much of anything.Quick note of warning: last 40-60 pages are dreadful and the ""Well, let me just see what happens so at least I can say I read it"" approach may not help you for long...."
5,Labyrinth,"An excellent story that opens the English-speaking world to the turbulent, violent but also fascinating history of South-West France. Mosse accurately captures the wild spirit of the region while at the same time weaving in a tale that is widely appealing. The first of what can be considered a multi-volume story that ends with Citadel, published in 2013."
3,I had such hopes...,"I really wanted to be swept away by this novel and in some parts I was. Some parts are really well done. Having read about the Cathars and the time period, I know the author really knows this period of history and region of France. The intertwining of the two Alices works as a structure overall. My main complaint has to do with editing. This book needed a strong editor. There are times when I can't tell who's talking and the some of the detail needed to be cut to help the story flow. The plot is a bit complicated and could have been streamlined to create a truly impactful story but we get lost in the details and end up with a mediocre novel. And I suppose I was disappointed to see the author chose to disconnect the Grail from the Cathars. In the end, I asked myself, so what was the point?"
4,Enjoyable fiction tying past & present,"Based on the description, I expected this to be a DaVinci Code knock-off, but gave it a shot since I recieved a free copy. Comparing Labyrinth to The Davinci Code do it injustice; this is definately not an imitator and is worth reading in it's own right. I enjoyed the characters, plot, and switching between the past and present. I'm not sure it has literary value (I wouldn't argue that The DaVinci Code does, either), but it's certainly complex enough to make you think about the plot and character relationships without being difficult to follow."
3,"Her Legs and Voice as beautiful as ever, but... can't she get a better designer for her CD covers?","Every album cover she made looks like some type of late 1970's bootleg punk record from a smelly basement record shop manned by hippies with an aversion to bathwater. And it's a pity because people DO judge a book by its cover. Had she gotten a better designer for her CDs, she probably would have attracted some serious funding from a real record company."
4,The A List : a typical novel for teens,"I've read all of the A List novels and a few of the Gossip Girls novels. They are both not the best books I've ever read, but they are good beach reads or books you can read in a short amount of time. I've read the books in nearly a day.The books are fairly short, and don't span over a wide timeline.But when the senior trip comes up to DC, the A Listers from the senior class do what they do every year: go to Vegas. For some fun one night, they go to a hypnotist. Sam is the only one that doesn't go up on stage and is glad she didn't. When they go to a friend's house to watch the show, everyone finds out about everyone's dirty little secrets.Who will show up in Vegas? Who has the biggest secret? You'll have to read it to find out.I don't recommended taking these books to school and reading them, or using it for a book report. I say just read it and ponder over it."
3,Reissue of 1987 album,"After hearing about Agnetha's post ABBA depression, I was excited to hear about this album. However, 20 years later, this is simply a reissue and unless you are a fan of ABBA, there is nothing noteworthy here. Without Benny and Bjorn, the instrumentals and writing are missing. Agnetha does cover a Justin Hayward song (Moody Blues) and a Jeff Lynne song (ELO), but its fairly unremarkable. BUT...if you are a fan, you'll probably love it!"
3,nice eyes but...,"this is supposed to be the all important follow up to her wrap your arms around me...unfortunately, of all the 3 international albums she has released, ranked from 1 to 3 (Wrap your arms being number 1, i stand alone at 2...), i'd put this at the last. she uses her lower vocal registers for much of the album and even above average cuts like the angels cry, we should be together,we move as one fail to move this normally rabid agnetha die hard.only the ska flavored ""just one heart"" and ""the angels cry"" (agnetha at her melancholic peak) is worth the spin."
2,Utterly mediocre,"This is, to borrow from the suburban imagery that Ms. Tyler loves so dearly, a novel of microwave-rewarmed ideas that were only half baked in the first place. Nothing in the novel -- not the characters, not the writing, certainly not the plot -- commands the reader's attention, and while that may have been Tyler's point, then at the very least she needs to come up with some thought-provoking ideas. Unfortunately, she fails on this count as well; the bit about marriage as fruit trees is just a hollow echo of what de Bernieres said, much better, in Corelli's Mandolin a decade ago! Not worth the read, unless you're an inveterate Tyler fan, I suppose."
2,"Unimaginative Storyline, Shallow/Cliche Characters","Thank goodness this book was given to me; I would not have wanted to waste my money on it. Tyler's characters are shallow stereotypes with little emotional development. Her glib treatment of the controversial issues surrounding WWII shows how little she was concerned with a ""thinking"" reader and simply geared this book to people who want a fast read that won't tax their minds. I didn't even care what happened to the characters by the end of the story. After the first 50-100 pages, I could see exactly where the plot would end up; very unimaginative. No one is happy. Characters do things for no apparent reason. I could go on, but don't want to waste any more time thinking about this book."
2,This book goes from interesting to boring and boorish,"This book started out interesting enough but over the years, the characters become so stale and predictable, by the end I could have cared less. And the one character you do have some vested interest in (Pauline, the lead female) completely disappears for endless, countless pages, while we hear how well her milk-toast husband does without her. Pauline, the source of fire in the book, completely loses out on life on pretty much every level, the husband ends up with the nice wife, the happy home - and ultimately he bored this reader half to sleep. How I even got through the last 10 years of their story is a testament to having books on CD and their soothing nature when stuck in heavy traffic."
5,One of Anne Tyler's best,"I agree with the earlier reviewers who found this one of Tyler's most rewarding books. It has a subtlety that's rare. Rather than imposing a happy or sad ending on her characters, she gives them life. The protagonists of THE AMATEUR MARRIAGE make each other (and often their family) miserable, and yet there is a way in which they continue to love each other. Tyler creates a world in which everything is not fixable; in which people make life hell for those they continue to love, and in which leaving, and possibly loneliness, are necessary."
2,"If you want to be depressed, then this one's for you....","In ""The Amateur Marriage"", Anne Tyler captures the truth of a group of people -- but there is nothing redeeming in this bittersweet portrayal, as there is in so much else of what she has written. I have just ended the book and find myself unable to go to sleep. It makes me remember all the long-gone people of my life, the transitoriness of life itself. I found myself asking, why couldn't this couple get it together? There was no explanation offered by Tyler. The only positive thing I gained was an appreciation for my own dear husband and my own life, which is not plagued by the sad unhappiness of Michael and Pauline's. I just wonder what Tyler hoped to accomplish with this book. If she wished to unsettle her audience, well, she did so with at least one of her customers -- me. But I don't mean that as high praise for the book. I say, avoid this book unless you want a gray and sad reading experience."
1,Boring!,Soooo boring---tedious! Characters are predictable....the book just goes on & in & on with nothing of any substance! I cannot understand how it received so many high ratings here!
5,Best read ever...I loved this book,I don't usually review books on amazon.com so this is a testament to how much I loved reading this book! I didn't want it to end and couldn't put it down. I enjoyed how these characters developed throughout the span of their lives. Highly recommended!
2,Very Disappointing,"I usually love Anne Tyler's books, but I found this one very disappointing and depressing. I kept wondering when the two main characters would move on with their lives to a separate and better place. Divorce is very painful, but it is preferable to living in continuing misery. Or, if you find a more suitable partner, life can become wonderful instead of depressing!"
4,"Menwhile, back in Baltimore","Beats me how Tyler keeps turning out such great novels; obviously, the well of her imagination is very deep. The Amateur Marriage is her 16th, and like its predecessors, it deals with one of society's outsiders: Pauline, who is too impulsive and querulous to fit into the tightly knit, Polish Catholic Baltimore community in which she find herself in love (and at war) with Michael. They marry, perhaps too quickly, and live upstairs from his cantankerous, embittered widow mother. Being good Catholics, they quickly saddle themselves with 3 children. Years pass, thirty of them, and we get painful, poignant, quirky, and humorous (all qualities at which Tyler excels in portraying with her writing skills) character development as these two misfits make each other progressively more and more miserable.Not Tyler's best effort, but you know, I've read anything she's written and have never been really disappointed. This one gets a B."
3,BLAH,I wasn't very impressed with this novel. I didn't care for any of the characters and found it went on and on and on. Very Blah.
4,Amateur Marriage - Professionaly written,"This was yet another wonderful novel written by the wonderful Anne Tyler. But what else would you grow to expect from such a wonderful author of her excellent caliber. Basically the 2 people involved are quite the mismach but they get married anyways. Its a marriage not quite made in heaven, but they are pros at dealing with this (no pun intended). Alot of interesting things continue to happen and the characters are developed quite well. Despite being a great novel, this novel also is almost a history text of american life thru out the last century. The only part I didn't like was that the child was named pagan. But what would you expect from a hippy."
3,"A disappointment, as far as I'm concerned","Of all Anne Tyler's novels, I'm afraid this one is the mustiest. Once again, she follows the relationship of two hopelessly mismatched people through years of marriage, as in ""The Accidental Tourist,"" only the characters in the new novel aren't interesting or quirky, and the whole plot comes across as a long, hopeless tangle. I kept finding shadowy recycled characters from other Tyler novels on the pages of this story, as if the author had run out of fresh personalities to employ. By halfway through the book, I had decided I didn't really care any more whether Michael and Pauline found happiness together. If this had been the first Anne Tyler novel I'd ever read, I doubt if I'd pick up any more. It's too bad; with her gift for characterization and human drama, she could surely do better."
2,Who Cares?,"I have always enjoyed the way that Anne Tyler develops characters. At first glance they appear offbeat, eccentric, and ""different"" but as they unfold before us we realize in them the humanity that connects with our own experience. You care about them as you understand who they are.At the halfway point in ""The Amateur Marriage"", I realized that I just did not want to spend any more time with these boring and disagreeable people. I can understand Ms. Tyler's desire to do something different and I don't need a ""happy"" story, but these monotone characters have none of the richness and depth that I expect from her writing."
3,Nice at first,"This eye cream worked well the first couple nights. Lately I had dry patches underneath my eyes and everyonce in a while would wake up with puffy eyes (probably from allergies?).The first couple times I used this cream my eyes were smooth and tight underneath and I was happy!However, it just stopped working after a week. I've been using it for a month now, and my eyes have returned to having dry patches of skin and puffiness. Maybe it will work better for others."
1,Ick...,"First of all,The Original movie was great but City Of Angels just went too far. Though the The Crow saga itself is Fantasy, This went far beyond the genre. I felt that Vincent Perez wasn't the right choice, he just didn't serve enough justice, and the whole storyline was over-Exaggerated"
1,Terrible...,"If you loved the first movie, ""The Crow"" starring the legendary Brandon Lee, stay away from this ""The Crow: City Of Angels"". It is horrible - the acting, execution of story, and the backdrop (a green foggy mist engulfs Los Angeles...sick). This is an insult to Brandon Lee who poured out his heart and soul to make ""The Crow"". Vincent Perez is terrible in this film, he has no grace or rhythm when he moves, he has terrible fight scenes, he acts wimpy, and his dialogue is bad. Only a couple of things good about this film, the name of the movie is cool, only it doesn't fit the material, and the tribute to Brandon Lee (VHS version, maybe DVD???) at the end of the movie. In my opinion, they should of stopped with the first one, Brandon Lee as Eric Draven will always be the best."
1,Not Worth The Purchase,This is one Blu-ray disc I should not have purchased. There is no improvement in picture/sound quality and the story line is not as good as the original.
4,GOOD,"I FOUND THIS MOVIE TO BE VERY GOOD & THE MUSIC IS GREAT. IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS PART ONE, I THINK PART ONE WAS GREAT, BUT I ENJOYED IT A LOT. I THINK NO ONE LIKES THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT'S NOT BRANDON LEE (WHO WAS AWESOME IN PART ONE) BUT I THINK VINCE PEREZ DID A GOOD JOB. THIS MOVIE HAS A LOT OF COOL THINGS ABOUT IT, WHEN YOU WATCH THE MOVIE DON'T LOOK AT IT LIKE JUST ANOTHER CROW MOVIE BUT MORE LIKE ANOTHER CROW STORY. THIS MOVIE HAS IT'S OWN COOL DARK STYLE."
2,Let it rest...,"They could not leave it could they, one good turn deserves another so they thought, well they were wrong.This is pretty much the same only worse. The picture quality is bad, it's like a dull light green. I only liked 2 things, hence the 2 stars. Iggy Pop. The motorbikes."
2,Sequals,"I am a fan of the first installment of the Crow Trilogy, so I felt, why not go out and rent the second one. Everybody always says that sequals will never be as good as the originals. In this movies case, I believe they should have stuck with only the first one. The plot was alright, but the acting and casting, downright unworthy of the release rack. After seeing this move I made a promise never to watch another sequal."
4,Everything you need...just hard to get it...,"Any Joyce fan would love to have this CD-ROM simply from the content alone. It has pretty much everything you could want.The only drawback is the difficulty in accessing the material. I suppose in order to save enough space on the CD to put in so much text they had to do away with the frills. However, anyone doing any deep study in the works of Joyce will find this CD invaluable."
1,Broken!!!,"When received one of the visors was broken. I think that the packaging needs to improved. These visors are packaged on a ""blister"" card. That card was shoved into a thin box and shipped. I'm not sure if they were walked on or smashed by heavier packages in the truck. Anyway now I don't have visors, and i have to ship these back to get new ones."
1,Stay away from LaCie drives if you like your data...,"Of the three LaCie drives I've bought, two failed within twelve months (of relatively light use). I've lost a 500GB drive and a 2TB drive. I guess LaCie just buys the cheapest drives they can. Stay away!"
5,The Safe Way to Light Candles,"Many lighters will not work when you are trying to light a candle inside a candle holder that is deeper than the votive holders. For this reason, the extended lighter wand that adjusts to three different levels, becomes very convenient.You may also find that lighting candles up on a mantle becomes much easier because you don't have to take the candles down to light them. You can easily reach candelabras and wall sconces or light candles in deeper containers, jars and hurricane lamps.The flexible wand that reaches to light the candlewick is especially helpful and after buying one of these I looked everywhere for another one. They seemed to be very popular and always out of stock! Fortunately now I can add these to my shopping cart! I just bought my third Luminere and have been happy with these candle lighters.~The Rebecca Review"
4,To Editor With Love,"This is a beautiful book. While it isn't a comprehensive ecyclopedia-like guidebook, it is an inspiring look at Southeast Asia from the perspectives of passionate locals. It's indispensible for finding unique hotspots and rich culture, but much more importantly, it shows you why you must go. I haven't been back to Asia since reading this book, but I am more eager to plan a trip than ever. By the nature of their format, traditional guidebooks just can't deliver the beauty and spirit of a destination. Kim Fay is on to something, and I hope to see more titles in this series."
1,Not Worth the $$,"I bought this based on reviews that I read here on Amazon. The book jumps all over the place. One page you are in Northern Vietnam, then to Thailand then back in Vietnam on the next page. Information is poorly grouped togther. I got MUCH better information from the Rough Guides."
4,From Spain with Love.,"Opus 2 Numbers 4 and 6 might be historically important like all Haydn Quartets before Opus 9 but that does not mean they should command much air-time nowadays in their own right. The one reason to purchase this disc is Opus 42 in D Minor, written in the 1780s in reponse to a mysterious commission from Spain. It is a succinct little masterpiece whose thematic material, once heard, is indelible. It is exceptionally well played by the Kodaly Quartet."
5,Love this China,"This is the china I registered for at my wedding 3.5 years ago. I was surprised when I got 7 place settings to start with! We are having Thanksgiving again this year and we are having 11 adults over so I wanted to increase my service set without breaking my bank! I was so happy to find this as well as the salad and bread and butter plate at such a reasonable price. I only wish I would have found them before the seller only had one of each left!! They are in perfect condition with no defects and were shipping well to avoid any damage. If you can find this setting for a reasonable price, go for it! It is classic and elegant all at the same time! It can be used for any occasion and you can change up the mood or feeling of it just by adding a different color charger is desired. I feel no need to to so because of the beauty of the setting on it's own!!"
3,a good book for beginners,"introduces the basic aspects of baking materials, processes and equipment for the beginner in a very concise manner. won't be of too much help for intermediate bakers or professionals but very informative, nevertheless"
5,R.I.P.,"Thank you, Sir John, for leaving us Rumpole, the tv adaptation of Brideshead, and so many other wonderful works ('Summer's Lease' a personal favorite).Rest in Peace,January 16, 2009"
4,Great baroque compositions but recording could be crisper,"This CD is a siblime collection of pieces, when I get tired of squealing metal, industrial sounds, 3 chord punk... I turn to CDs such as this.The music is splendid, and in fact heart filling. However, I think the recording is ""muted"" a bit. I think I should ""feel"" the deeper bass notes on some of the pieces, so I think it may be since NAXOS is more of a budget operation (ah the price is the give away eh).So, if you are a super audio-phile or uber-classical snob you may find the quality in the recording lacking.However, if you are beyond only liking Mozart's Eine Kleine Nacht Music and Bach's all too famous Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, this is a refreshing new step to older music. Hard core Barouque for the less fussy classical listener."
1,BEWARE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"BEWARE I Saw these straps in the store by my House with two straps as in the picture for $22.00. When i found them on Amazon for $17.00 i picked them up, to find out u get one not two as shown in the picture."
4,On Record of Lodoss War,"I loved the series Record of Lodos War. I went on the web to find the music from it though. I do love the music from it. My favorite songs are ""Honor,"" ""Parn's Theme,"" and ""Dance Party at Valis."" I also love ""Song of the Elf."" If you loved the series, I suggest that you pick up this CD."
5,This book is a wonderful sweet story. Romance is alive!,Loved this sweet story. I am never disappointed with Rebecca's books. The heroine is strong and the ending is great. I love romance
4,Works as advertised. Crippled backup software included.,"Plugged it in (USB2) and it worked. Comes with backup software, but it's a very crippled version of Dantz Retrospect. It works, but there is no tweaking whatsoever, and it's so dumbed down, that it's actually frustrating to use. Also, the drive is not super quiet, but no big deal for me since I only use it for backup. Overall, I'd recommend it - especially if you have your own backup software."
1,Big Hassle,"This device worked for about 1 week and then broke.I had to pay $30 to ship it to Oregon and another $10 to pack and bubble wrap it. It will take 10-14 days to get it back, not to mention the week of emailing back and forth about it to get an address to send it for repair. If I had bought this from a store I could have exchanged it for a new one same day at no additional cost to me. Very upset. Very disappointed!"
4,LaCie 500 GB external drive,"The drive is working great but it also came with several choices of software that are not straightforward to figure out. When I called tech support they took the easy way out & only explained how to use the simplest one, which backs up your entire system. So I still do not know how to use the one that backs up by just updating your files."
2,Died - less than 1 1/2 years....,"My first LaCie was a 200 gig. When it filled up, I got the 500 gig. Started off fine, but at about 13 months it started to make a grinding sound off and on. It would power up and down and make stopping and starting whirs. Now it doesn't mount on either mac or pc.I will not be purchasing this brand again."
1,Do not buy!,"I've had repeatedly awful experiences with Lacie hard drives. We bought three in one go: one tetra, and two 500 GB. The tetra lasted for about three months before it broke down, one 500 lasted about a year, and now the final one went down after a couple of years. Every attempt to fix these problems through LaCie has been impossible. For instance, if you try to contact their troubleshooting department, clicking on the url brings you back to your own acct. information. Clearly, this company has good technology, but awful reliability and total lack of concern for the customer."
4,Above average drive.,Bought mainly for a new iMac with fw800. I like the heavy duty metal case and simple design. Consistently get about 50MBs on read and writes. My only complaint is when the computer is placed in standby/sleep mode the Quadra HD spins down but the internal fan continues to run. A little annoying when you expect everything to be off or in standby.
1,Go ahead and buy at least 5 extra power supply cables...,"DO NOT BUY THIS! I have replaced 2 power supply cables and need a third. This drive has been used very little mostly due to the power supply problems. Initially, I thought the drive was great and bought a LaCie Rugged HD to carry to and from the office. That drive has now failed as well in under 2 years with an average amount of use. I will NEVER buy a LaCie product again and will tell everyone I know to avoid their poorly made products like the plague."
3,Getting started in the negotiating world,"Tim Hindle's book is an easy-to-use introduction to negotiating. This is the first book on negotiating that I've read. It is divided into three main chapters: Preparing, Conducting and Closing. It has a common sense approach and offers lots of tips including countering tactics for leading questions, intimidation, bluffing, threats or insults. It contains graphics and photographs in a clean design that help convey the ideas. I found the book was written for high level business negotiators, but most of the tips would be helpful in dealing with car dealers, gas stations, banks, stores, utility companies, or even a significant other. The book is a handy size for tucking away and reading a few pages at a time. It was an easy read."
2,Only good as long as the battery,"I would not recommend this camera due to the ""long-life"" battery. My camera quite holding the date and time that we use to time stamp the pictures. That information is kept by what the manual calls a ""long-life"" battery and can only be replaced by a Konica Minolta Service Facility."
4,Good camera with the Price,"I have this Camera for almost 3 years. This camera is excellent in daylight but miserably fails in low light. This is my first Digital Camera and I am happy with day light performance but I hate it for pictures taken inside home. Automode never works good. Try manually, setup the shutter speed and aperature it is near perfect."
3,Eh...not what I hoped.,"I should preface this by saying that I'm not a big fan of Western romances. It's just not really my thing. That being said, I was willing to take the plunge with Heart of the West since I fell in love with PW's style while reading Once in a Blue Moon. And I think I can say with relative confidence that it's not the Western element that I grew tired of here. I believe there were just too many *other* people and extraneous/unnecessary romances and sidetracks that took away from the momentum between Clementine and Zach. I actually skipped portions to get the thing moving along. The novel needed to be streamlined, IMO. Look, I don't shy away from big plots or elaborate detail. I just flat out got bored at times with parts of this book. Not enough Clementine and Zach. Too much Clem and Gus. Way too much Gus."
4,Heart of the west,"I'll begin by saying that I love Penelope Williamson. She writes such full, rich, & multi-layered characters. This is not just in relation to the main characters but even side characters had depth and tremendous growth throughout the book. When it comes to romance there is really no comparison. HTW is awesome. It's epic. My complaints are minor. The 2nd half focused a little too much on the secondary characters even though their stories were very interesting. Also w/o giving too much away it took a little too long for the H/h to connect. Also after waiting SO LONG for the connection it was a little...anti-climatic. With all of that this book is leaps and bounds above other stuff out there."
4,Slightly Disappointing,"I started out loving this novel and not being able to put it down. Part I of this book is amazing. The love between Clementine and Rafferty is heart-wrenching. However, as the novel progressed, I found myself growing more and more disinterested because the story wasn't solely concentrated on the love between these two dynamic characters. Even when Clem and Rafferty were the focus, I felt like their story was watered down somehow. It wasn't that I didn't like Hannah and Drew, and Erlan and Jere, but their stories didn't grab me like Clementine and Rafferty. Still, I gave this novel 4 stars because the writing is excellent and the main characters are well-rounded and three-dimensional."
2,Boring,"This is the worst college class I have had. This book is sooo boring. It is all common sense; I learned nothing except how to name everyday knowledge with big words. This class was awful, and so was the book. Sorry I'm usually not negative about anything I just can't help it, it has been a horrible four months. I expect a A, which is a really big deal because I thought I was going to fall asleep in several of the tests. Horrible, just horrible."
2,Sociology in our times,"this book is very board. it doesn't discuss things in details. Personally, I don't like this kind of book. I would rather get a psychology than this."
4,Book delivered,"Book was sent as promised! Good condition, thank you. Will be needed for college classes. Priced way, way below what college wanted for it. I saved a bunch."
4,Sony SU-RS11X Stand is great for Sony 60,"I love the stand, looks like steel but more of a combination of nicely done press-wood which was covered with a great looking aluminium product. It was easy to assemble and setup. It has a security strap to hold the set on. The only minus is that the upper shelf has limited headroom. It was fine for my TIVO/DVD units but had to more my larger Sony Receiver to bottom shelf for it to fit. Not as easy to read or adjust at that level."
5,This One Got Me Hooked on Tony Hill,"Not only did McDermid hook me with this novel, it also got me interested in the BBC series of the same title. The TV serial was exceptionally well done, though sometimes I'd prefer that they'd followed the novels more closely. There is no substitute, though, for curling up with the book itself and letting imagination do the rest.Favorite Tony Hill quip (when told he had to attend a faculty meeting): ""I'd rather set my hair on fire and put it out with a hammer!"""
3,Too advanced for beginners too simple for experienced,"The DVD was basically a taped seminar Mark gave back in 2002. I didn't get much out of it mainly because I've use the same charting program TC2000 that Mark speaks about for about 7 or 8 years now. Additionally, I am very familiar with the proprietary technical indicators (Time segmented volume, Money Stream and Balance of Power which are only available in TC2000)he introduces the audience to for analyzing stocks. If you don't have TC2000, don't even bother ordering the DVD. If you do, you'd probably get more out of the FREE training videos available at [...], which are very, very good.So was this DVD a total waste of money? No, it's helpful to learn to how other traders evaluate technical indicators, after all, picking up just one simple tip can make you thousands of dollars."
2,Frustrating product,"Slow. I can't use this as a 1TB drive because I can't transfer that quantity of data, it starts slow and slows with time. I purchased this to move a TB of data from one system to another. After a lot of time and hassle it simply did not work. When transfer dropped to below 1mbit, I gave up. I tried plugging into one switch, another switch, tried the USB port.On the plus side the media server works at least nominally. I suppose this product would work ok with small nightly backups or light media server work.A lot of people claim network bottlenecks but I finally spent more money for a Thecus 5200n. Excellent, great speed. Did in under a day what this thing failed to do in a week+.Lot of frustration and waste of time for me. Almost converted to a doorstop. I'll try it as a media server at home I suppose."
1,LaCie Ethernet Big Disk,"Purchased this item hoping to use it with Leopard OS X on the newest iMac. Unfortunately, Time Machine does not support this drive as an ethernet network back up drive. It is recognized on the network but not by Time Machine. Attempted to use the drive as a direct USB 2.0 connected back up drive. Unfortunately, the drive was not recognized by either the new iMac nor an older one running 10.4. Online tech support was not helpful at all. If you choose to buy this product and need tech support, dig for the number and call them directly. Pity, on paper it would have been a great set up."
3,Complete nonsense,"These were Brahms's last works before his death. Not only did he have no chance to publish them or to have second thoughts about them, but they have always stood as his last musical testament. Why the inventions above?"
3,Not her best!!,"Very bad effort from a MASTER. For someone else, this would be good, but from the Queen of SUSpense, Psychology, and Mystery? Pedestrian story of greenpeace like group of malcontents, making protest, environmental issues, etc. but Rendell never does get beneath the surface headlines. Please try her other books, she is the best mystery/suspence/psychology novelist."
2,Road Rage,"Not as good as most Ruth Rendell books. Lots of characters and no character development, and this includes all the police staff in the book. As a result the middle of book seems muddled and you never really care what happens to them. If you must keep track of Inspector Wexford read it otherwise don't bother."
3,Practical or Basic Railway Engineering,I found this book to be a bit basic for my use. I know the book was targetted at Undergrads but a bit more detail would have been useful. Also reference to standards would have helped. The scope was quite wide and the book has good bones. More a bedside table book than a reference book.
1,Not 3/2 mm,This item description specifies 3/2mm thickness but the suit I received had a 2mm body and 1mm sleves/legs. Too thin for my purposes so I returned it for a refund to my credit card.I gave it 1 star because of the incorrect description - there is no 2mm spring suits to select from so I think the product description is wrong rather that a item shipment error.I have owned Body Glove suits in the past. The quality looked fine.
2,Amazon.com tried to tell me - I should have paid attention!,"I had read the statement that said 'discontinued - alarm not working!""BUT, I have one identical that I've used for almost 3 years, and I love it, until the alarm mechanism was stuck on, and I couldn't shut it up! Anyway, this store had 2 in stock, and I thought, oh well, the one worked fine for quite awhile, I'll just go ahead and buy the two, and I'll have the other one on hand for the future - way out future!Wrong - neither of the 2 received alarms works correctly....One keeps losing time, and the other keeps losing power, which makes everything else off...the alarms, the time, and I miss taking my pills.I'll be looking for a new and improved replacement for all of them - very soon!"
5,excellent!,"This is a great product. It works really well, is easy to set and holds big pills. The only problem is that we can't figure out how to make it louder, the alarm is kinda quiet."
3,Library book,"This is an academic reference book, designed for a library shelf. It is a little bigger than its 702 pages would suggest, because it is printed on thick glossy paper in quite a good printing quality. The illustrations are in a style reminiscent of years long gone by (all B&W;).The chapter on wood consists of two sections. The first contains descriptions of some thirty trees: fairly elaborate botanical description, brief characterization of wood type, a few words on the use made of the wood and a listing of archaeological finds. For the anatomical description the reader is referred to a work that (finally) appeared as ""Plants in Archaeology"". It is obvious that not much research has been done on the wood in Ancient Egyptian objects. The second section deals with the technology (joints) and tools used by the Egyptians: a much more limited topic and one lending itself well to an overview."
3,Gotta hit it kinda hard...,"The big flaw here is that you have to hit the mole just hard enough. It's hard plastic, so if you don't hit it just right, the hard plastic mallet slips right off the hard plastic game board and you don't get a winning hit. This may be easy for a 5-6 year old to do, but my 3 year old has a hard time with this (no, he's not dumb -- he's quite accomplished at PS2) So if this is for a younger child, make sure they place the console between their feet to hold it still or on a rubber mat. Otherwise, it's fun enough!"
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK not a waste of time for a New Horse Owner,I am a new horse owner with a 7 year old Appy and a 10 year old QH. This book hit alot of the problems we are running into and a starting point on trying to fix the issue. It is easy to read and a novice can understand it and relate. I loved this book and recommend it highly!~
5,"Only release of its kind (and if there are others, ha!)","This CD is a must in any self-respecting music collector's stacks...contains the best Faust track ever, ""Why Don't You Eat Carrots"", which contains an especially entertaining/harrowing/horrifying battle between the band and a not-particularly-having-a-good-day oscillator. ""Meadow Meal"" you WILL find yourself chanting while walking somewhere, and you won't want to, but ""Miss Fortune"" has the same effect. Classic. Get it while it's still on the shelves, it's out of print now..."
5,beautiful knife,"This Is a very beautiful knife! I think its better than the buck knife. The only downside is the carry case. Its cheap and hard to open, but i bought a different case for it."
5,"Keeper 05723 1 1/2"" by 8' Heavy-Duty Motorcycle & ATV Tie Down Straps",The best insurance you'll ever buy and tailor made for strapping down with handle bars! You won't need any soft straps or other straps with these and the heavy duty breaking capacity will give many years of worry free towing!
5,Tie Downs,"I was pleased with the product and service, when purchasing this item. The tie downs are nicely designed, in that they have the soft loop built into them. They are seemingly plenty strong for the purpose intended, which was to tie down my motorcycle to a trailer. Recommended."
5,Cultural Insight and a Marevlous Story in one!,"The Waiting Years shares the unhurried pace of much Japanese literature. This helps to set the flavor of the world in which the story is based...a world where things take time and waiting is necessary.The story highlights many inequalities in traditional Japanese society - with a strong focus on the inequality of women - using believable characters. Enchi shows us both sides of the coin, making us understand each character's actions even when the action evokes outrage.Enchi is one of Japan's foremost female authors and this book is a fine example of why.Very highly recommended for all but those who need a fast paced yarn."
1,THIS IS NOT A 120 WATT AMPLIFIER,This amplifier is really a 40 watt amplifier with a peak output of 120 Watts. This is clearly a misrepresentation and the specifications are totally incomplete.
3,It did a pretty good job.,"Didn't fix the dent completely but it recovered most of it. I did had higher expectations from it, especially after reviewing all the reviews over and over but it just wasn't strong enough to get the rest of the dent. Plus the dent wasn't that impacted in.."
4,It was't bad!,It didn't wok on the dent I had on my car but maybe The dent was bigger than what this tool can handle. I am sure it would work on smaller dents but it did not work on mine.
3,measure your dent before purchase,"The puller itself is very powerful but too large. It fails to work on smaller and non-smooth dent, usually at the bumper. I was planning to return but noticed I may have to pay the shipping so just keep it for other usage."
4,Too big,"Too big to use on the dent I had, but I did help out a friend in a recent accident. Worked well, just be sure that the dent is large enough before purchasing this item (must be at least the size of a small dinner plate)"
3,fix,does not work good on more pricey cars body of pricey cars are hard to remove dents body to hard
1,Good for a short time.,"These are like fake ones... I bought two of them for my first generation PSP, and both of them do not work anymore after I did not play my PSP for few months. Do not recommend to purchase this item. If you want a good quality, get the original SONY version. It's around $10 more expensive, but the quality is way better than this one."
1,Battery Sucks,"Don't buy it unless you are desperate. It works, but it only lasts perhaps an hour and half."
3,For academia by academicians,"You must be a Custer Battlefield purist to fully enjoy this work. It was like reading a college textbook that had been written for other professors. Unfortunately, it was not written by someone who had an understanding of weaving a story together and properly illustrating that story visually."
5,WOW,"The most beautiful music you will EVER hear in your life. I feel no need to say anything more..but Amazon says I need at least 20 words so this is BEAUTIFUL, MOVING, UNBELIEVABLE, STUNNING..gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous!"
5,"A warm, emotional read.","This is a rather short romance, but the author has packed a wealth of emotions inside its pages. The hero is strong and noble, old-world ethical and very Italian. When his childhood friend is in trouble, Nic is there for her. Meg is a strong heroine, and I could identify with her, although there were instances in which she should have just smacked Nic across the face. This is a quick read and very enjoyable."
4,Very good product,It is ok it does what iit is suposed to do and help with dandruff some I guess just trying to get enough words.
4,hmm...,"my problem may be different, this didn't help me much, it did work for my cousin and her mother though..."
3,Great set but,"I opened the box and put it together and imediately my 15 month old son liked it banging on the table and wanted to get into the chair it looks really cool... the chair is great and the unbrella is great but,the table was unstable it rocked and could not push the parts together to keep it from rocking I think the pieces are a bit off...I think this would be great on the grass or carpet.. I was really excited to get this for him but disappointed in the product..."
4,prom,"It's that time of year... prom!!!Anna and Ben are finally together, but will an attractive girl staying at the Birnbaum's mess with their relationship again?Cammie and Adam are doing well, until Cammie finds out more about the night her mother died.Sam is happy with where she's at with Eduardo, until he tells her that he won't be able to come to her prom... or can he?Drama is abound once more in the juicy sixth book."
5,"Amazing, interesting read!","Zoey Dean is back with her sixth book in the A- List series. In this book, it's Prom at the Beverly Hills High School and noone on the A- List goes, but when Sam hears about a film contest, and when Anna wants to go, she decides to go and make a video on the prom weenies b- listers. Also Anna gets jealous of a gorgeous junior staying at Ben's house for school, but she gets over it and she and her friends help for her prom. At Anna's prom everything goes a little too well and Sam decides not to release her film because she's to happy and was awarded prom queen. Cammie on the other hand a horrofying secret that her father had an affair with Sam's mother during the time of Cammie's mother's death. Zoey Dean is back with her probably best book so far in the series, leaving her fans dying to read the next book. I would definitely recommend this book and this series."
1,A Roosevelt Hater posing as an Historian.,"Fleming reveals himself as a sterotypical Roosevelt hater, the likes of which should be extinct by now. Fleming manages to put the worst possible face on everything Roosevelt did, and gives credence to all of FDR's enemies. There are always nay-sayers about any administration, especially one which actually attacks problems and does things. FDR, with all his pros and cons, was a complex, subtle, and yes, devious politician. Fleming fails to find the good because he didn't look for it. I rated this one star because the zero option was not available."
1,Scurrilous is not a strong enough adjective,"I did get get through 50 pages of this pseudo-history before giving up. I had hoped to find new insights into an intriguing period of history but instead encountered a continuous re-hash of half truths and tired stories. The invective used by the writer would discourage any person who is trying to learn the truth. I did learn one new thing! Another species of ideologue was identified-an ""interventionist"". Please, no more of these inane labels. In any case it seems that the author had his opinions set before he wrote the book and then tried to justify his views with this unfortunate work."
1,Brazen Muckraking,"Although this book is presented as a work of non-fiction, it is filled with inaccuracies and unsupported allegations and should not be considered seriously by anyone interested in the history or the people involved. Primary historical sources are ignored by a writer who strives to fit ""facts"" to his conclusion instead of altering his conclusion in response to the facts. This book would only be of interest to those who are trying to sell the idea that the gilded age of child labor, sweat shops, bread lines, racism, and Hoovervilles is preferable to the broader progress the US experienced during the 20th century."
1,This Suite is barely ok!,"I just purchased SystemSuite 5 after using SS4 for the last couple years. Besides the new color, I have seen nothing that was improved. All the Utility tests are the same as SS4. The firewall is beyond slow on loading up and appears less in quality than ZoneAlarms free firewall. The anti-virus appears the same as SS4 and still misses virus's. Had a few basic problems, but Tech support assisted via email. Web page support appears useless with a max. of 20 answers for SS5. I was going to see how Norton SystemWorks 2004 rates to see if this 1 goes."
2,Just Plain Sucks,"I bought this 3 days ago and right after i installed it, i found out i wasted $50.00 and so now i think im going to go back to Mcafee. Don't waste your money on this!"
5,"slipper,slipper and more slipper","i opened the box,unpacked the slipper, placed them on my feet, kicked them off immediately. I for got to takeout the paper stuffing in the toes.found them of very good quality, style wise and material composition, quite nice and then I slippered off in to the sunset."
2,"Eh, collecting dust.",The game is fun if you like InuYasha but not much of a roleplay because you don't have much of a choice when you play the game. The only freedom you have is to move around the world and what moves you pick when you fight but you can't chose how to level and I stopped playing after 2 days because I felt like I was doing nothing but battling and not really playing.
4,I really like these cards but after number 441 it jumps,"These set of cards along with the first set is nice but after number 441 it jumps to 582 (my set does I wonder if it is only the one I got that is like that?) and skips from 442 through 581. So now I have a double print of 582 through 722 in my set. Still, they are helpful for study or review. :)"
4,Great for the little rescuer,"Both my 4 year old and my 2 year old love this. It was so hard to find an ambulance toy, when I saw this I had to get it. My kids LOVE the blue light and siren. They enjoy each of the rescue trucks, so much so they've already broken off some of the small detail pieces on the trucks. All in all, a nice toy for the rambunctious boy to play with indoors."
1,cheap plastic,"Was thrilled to wear these glasses. Was looking for a product like this for a long time.Unfortunately, they broke on the second day of use. A little glue fixed the problem butthe plastic broke a second time the nest day. what crap."
4,DeWalt Reinforcer,These glasses are very comfortable to wear and are easily worn both in driving and riding my motorcycle.The wrap-around characteristic of the lenses is very nice.
5,Bifocal safety shades,"I have 2 pairs of these they are great. They look good fit well and resist scratches, one pair ive had for about 6 months"
4,Works fine,"The item itself works fine and shipped fairly fast, but I was disappointed with something else. I had specifically been looking for a black cable so it would be more easily concealed. I was disappointed however, that the cable I received was NOT the one in the picture. It was thick and WHITE! But other than that, it works okay, I just wanted a black cable."
5,Gemini PH62089 Stereo Mini-Male to 2 RCA-Male - 6 Feet,"It's a Gemini PH62089 Stereo Mini-Male to 2 RCA-Male - 6 Feet as described and it works fine...no problems, so far."
5,Found it only at Amazon,"I have searched our local Boy Scout stores and even on line with the BSA Scoutstuff and only found this work by the founder of the world wide Scouting movement at Amazon. I was surprised when I received it that it was in a larger format than the original printing, but this reprint has larger print, larger illustrations, and wide margins for my notes of how to apply Lord Baden Powell's wisdom. I decided I preferred this larger format. I was very pleased to find this important work available on Amazon."
3,Good fill in,I use it when my Pro Plan runs out so the cats can taste something different. They'll eat it up.
1,Filler rubbish.....,"Ingredient list speaks for itself.You pay for what you get...do your cat a favour, spend a bit more on him/her. They need a lot more than useless cereal filler. Just because it gets eaten doesn't mean it's good for them does it...."
1,Wrong kibble,"I specifically ordered the Whiskas Dry Cat food in the original selection. Recently the company has redone their kibble and my cats do not like it as well. This was listed a :""original Whiskas"" and one of the reviews even said they had the same experience. they were glad to find the older version and so was I. If I had wanted the new kibble,, I would have bought it at my grocery,,, incidentially cheaper than on this site. Surprise,,,, guess what was sent,,,,, the new version. Since I suspected it was the wrong thing,, I had to open the bag to verifiy it. Of course,, it was the new smaller kibble I could get anywhere. So I guess,,, you all are not very careful of your orders or you just think we are dumb."
1,Simply wretched,"The Seer King offers but two things: graphic sex and detailed descriptions of strategy and battle tactics. Character, world-building, even plot -- all the finer points of literature -- are mostly glossed over or outright ignored. Fine. This is a book that knows its limits. What is objectionable is that its trite. The sex scenes are stale, unimaginative and not particulary evocative. The battle scenes are straightforward descriptions of standard tactics lifted, one supposes, directly from the manual. One is left with the impression that the principal character is a competent soldier, but not the budding Napoleon that the author is attempting to describe. Overall, the novel lacks vivid descriptions of either sex or violence, its supposed strengths. With nothing else to fall back on, the reader is left to regret his/her purchase."
4,Blind man on a flying horse,Really interesting CD some songs a little folky for my taste but the more I play it the more i like it.Female singer absolutely fanastic great voice.Go the Irish!!! Purchased this CD with after only hearing one song that has had a lot of air play here in Australia.
3,Nokia 6600,"went with T mobile Nokia 6600 replacing my Sony T610. It is a multifunction phone, reception quality is better than the 610. speaker phone quality is good, and poping in a 512mb MMC card, it rocks ! putting in MP3 player, lots of games and application to download.DOwnside is the size of the phone, it is BIG for today's standard. and the battery life is bad !I could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days! a bit dissapoitnd on that! the GPRS web access is sloooooooooooooow!DaveC"
1,bulky to handle,this has some facilities .. and also has an big screen with reasonable clarity.. but it's shape is very odd to look at and very hard to handle it.. its very difficult to catch the phone and dail the number's with one hand.. we should use both our hand's to use it that is the worst part of having this phone
3,"Ok, quite good...","This one has a good looking. It's oval and... nice. I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick. It's easy to use. Not too small, and not too big. The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color. And, other else, the camera is still VGA.I must say, this one is quite slow to open an application. Sometimes, it needs few minutes to open an application. What's wrong with it? Is it really slow, or what?Few month ago, it's very popular among my community. It's good. But not good enough for me. :!OK, score 7.0Oh yes, the newest color of this phone is quite cool."
4,featurefan,"Pros1. Big Display2. Most of the functions available...(I can write 10+ points on this, but I am telling in one line)3. Built in Antenna helps a lot for signal strength4. Can store around 400 photosCons1. Little slow... means when any key is pushed, you can feel the time taking to come up2. Most of the ring tones given by Nokia are low in volume, so chances of missing calls is more (Best way is to keep the vibration on)3. When video is used, battery is getting discharged very fast4. Its little big (Small Soap Box), but better than my previous Nokia.Just a normal user can buy without even thinking....If u are looking to use video frequently, I don't think this phone is matured enough, b'coz of battery life...."
3,Kiss,The footage wasnt the best. It was ok it just didnt get close up on the band. I only got it for my dad.
3,great show,"no matter who is in kiss they still stick to what made them. a great live show. it didn't matter who was or is in kiss as long as they still have gene and paul. they are the heart of the band, gene for his love of money and paul because he loves kiss and rock-n-roll.i as a long time fan look forward to this release, as long as it looks, sounds, and feels like kiss. long live the gods of thunder!!"
2,1/2 KISS,"I have seen these guys in the 70's and during the 90's for the ""farewell"" tour. The key issue with this DVD and the band line up is its only 1/2 the original band.Why is Eric Carr wearing Peter's make up and the other guy wearing Ace's spaceman costume?Eric was in Kiss before as the ""Fox"". Why change?Tom Thayer was a tour manager and in a Kiss tribute band.This is only 1/2 of the classic Kiss line up even if it appears otherwise.The DVD has a good mix of classic Kiss tunes and Paul and Gene are the heart of this band.But without Peter and Ace you won't find ""New York Groove"", ""Shock Me"" or ""Beth"" on the set list.Most importantly the band's best stuff was made as Paul, Gene, Ace and Peter and that's not the band anymore even if an attempt is made to portray that. Let it be known that Ace Frehley is a great lead guitarist and that is clearly missing here."
3,Excellent show,"The performance was excellent. All 4 musicians were on the top of their game, lead by Paul's energy and enthusiasm. It was well filmed and well recorded. Being a Paul Stanley fan for 25 years, I am sorry to say I lost respect for him in under one minute with his ignorant political speech. As soon as the shock wore off, I had to sell the dvd."
3,One DVD To Many,"I think KISS has finally released one DVD too many.It's cool to hear some songs that Ihaven't heard live before,but mainly it's just more of the same.The PowerVision select a Kiss feature that has been tauted?BORING!!Glad I bought it here & saved 10 bucks."
1,"Sad,Sad,SAD ! ! !","Dressing up people as Ace and Peter is SSSSSOOOOOooooo pathetic!If your young and never saw the glory days,I understand.But really how sad is this?Getting Tommy Thayer to dress up as someone else and to play Ace's solos ""INSTEAD"" of his own is Gene and Paul screaming""we would rather you were someone else"".Imagine if your best friend split up with his or her girlfriend or boyfriend.Time goes by and next time you see them they are with someone dressed up like thier ex...and they paid them to act like the person too.Welcome to the current KISS line-up.This dvd is Gene and Paul playing roles they did years ago.Acting like a band that DOES NOT exist anymore.They should get over it and release a dvd of a ""real""KISS line-up.(One that does not portray other people).SAD!P.S.That's the thing about money Bud...it sometimes makes ya' do things you wouldn't normaly do.(From the film ""Wall Street"")."
2,Not cut out to be,"I have had the camera a little over 10 months and all i can say is that it was a waste of money. Why? the lcd screen turned off one day, and Minolta refused to cover it saying it was caused by impact. the truth of the matter is that, i rarely used the camera; and when i did take it out, it was kept in a camera case. Now i have a 400 dollar dead camera. I do have a Olympus C4000 that i use for regular daily photography and it has served me fine for 2 years with no problems! If I had known the camera was so fragile that it broke on its own, then maybe i would have bought another brand."
2,What a disappointment!,"Areas of high contrast have a conspicuous and distracting white (and sometimes blue) stripe, so I'm returning my camera. As a test, I took comparable pictures with my old Sony U-10, and what a difference! The Sony pictures are free of ""errors"" and are much sharper as well. Think I'll stick with Sony; apparently, you really do get what you pay for.The Dimage XG is small and is loaded with features (ISO control, voice memos, etc. etc.) but that doesn't matter if all you want is a sharp and accurate picture. Shame on the WSJ for recommending this camera."
1,Could not get past the focusing limitations,"Seems like a charming camera in many ways, but was completely unable to focus in a wide variety of situations for us (one children's dinner; one cocktail party; and some photos of the rooms in our house).Manual has a half-page of disclaimers which discusses how the camera ""may not be able to focus in certain situations"" -- but literally it was impossible to discern that there were even human beings in the pictures we'd taken."
4,Very good book for developer covers version 6,This book is very well explained and written. Mostly covers the advance topics of developement in Oracle. If you do not have any proir experience in using forms and reports then this book is not for you.
1,Waste of time and money,This book could have been good if they include the the database library examples. I've been reading the book up until chapter 4 where you can follow the instruction but I end up very disappointed for the database that the author is referring to doesnt exist. I already shelve the book down to my basement until somebody can give that old database from Talbot farm.
3,Images for the imagination,This is an excellent collection of images of the universe but the music-well it didn't work. So watch this on mute and crank-up your own tunes and all will be better.
5,Excellent Stamp Resource!,"For a collector of USA and Canadian stamps of 30 years this catalog is simply the best. Not only is it complete, accurate, but also diverse. First, the size of the book makes it easy to read and access. The various values of grades, average, fine, very fine, never hinged are included along with used, mint, blocks, sheets, and cover values. Scott numbers and BW images of nearly every stamp issued is included. Beside regulars and commemoratives, it includes air, duck, revenue and other issues. Highly recommend for beginners as it has good index, glossary, explanations of errors and differences and history. The values listed are reasonable to current market pricing."
5,Fantastic and easy to install!,"Talk about an easy way to uncluttered your garage. You can use it on bikes, you can use it with furniture, you can put a couple together with a palette and lift anything you want up to the ceiling. It installs in minutes. I have four of these in my garage. Many of my friends have also installed them after seeing them up. I have yet to hear a complaint. They are super sturdy, work like a charm, and are kinda fun to use. Give it a try!"
5,Easy to use,"THis product was easy to install and easy to use. Only complaint would be that the hardware to attach it to the ceiling joists was not in the package. I had to go to the hardware store to get those items. Even if you do not attach them to the joists, you still have to have wood to attach to the ceiling and then attach the hoist."
3,What I paid for,"Read all the reviews. They are all dead on. Product is basically rather cheap, but will do the job. I believe the product is geared to the person who wants to hang little Jack or Jill's scooter from the ceiling of the already toy-stuffed storage compartment that they call a garage. The rope should be replaced ASAP as it is pathetic, but once again, the whole thing didnt cost much. Mounting it soundly to most garage ceilings does prove to be a pain in the saddle bone. I have a relatively light -20lb road bike (not my best)hanging on this contraption above my pickup. I feel relatively certain that it is ok and will not fall down and whack my wife's Audi sitting on the other side of the garage, as that would most likely cause a rift in our relationship. Bottom line, dont expect anything more than what you have read about in all the reviews as there are no really good or bad surprises here."
4,"Works well, price is right",I have four of these and they work well in my garage. My 8 and 6 year-old kids can put their bikes up and take them down. So reasonably priced.
3,LIke the product very much,"the problem I have is you get the assembly in a very large box,more than you need, and no hardware. You need to purchase the lag bolts to install. Needless to say I have no installed it because of that reason. I order online for convenience and have no car. lot of good this does me."
2,Not a keeper,"Josie runs a catering business with her twin sister Kitty after her parents' death. Josie's only relationship is with her dog when suddenly Paul and his giant Boxer smash into her life.This was the most pathetically contrived book I've read in a long time. I really have little respect for a romance that goes from ""I'm not sure I like him"" to ""Let's get married"" with little or no development. This book did that and had little else to redeem itself. Even the lush setting of New Orleans was barely explored. The dialogue was pure torture, rambling sentences and interruptions. Sure, the dog thing is cute, but it will only get you so far in a romance."
4,Fairly balanced work on a controversial subject,"Like most serious African-American educators, I don't have a high opinion of so-called ""Afrocentric"" history. However, I do understand why many of the Black masses feel the psychological need to beleive the historical tall tales and overemphasis on Egyptian Mythology (although in reality, most of today's African-Americans are descended from West Africans).Dr. Moses does a good job of tracing the roots of afrocentric thought and I learned a lot from the solid evidence he offers. However, he could have left out the personal attacks and name calling regarding Moefi, Lefkowitz, and Karenga and discussed them strictly within the faultiness of their historical work. But other than that, it's a pretty good book."
1,A Critical Critique of Afrotopia,"I usually don't spend any time thinking about or writing reviews of literature I feel is misinformative to the African American people. But this book I find not only misinformative but grossly in error and very subjective. It not only misinterprets many of those in the African American community, it assumes that Afrocentrism is some kind of cult recognized by the misinformed. The author obviously is out of touch with the African American community in general and specifically those ""interllectuals"" he inaccurately discusses. I totally wasted my money and time with this book."
5,Geek Music Rules,"When in doubt, listen to the Prezzies. They've been more commercially successful than their cerebral geek rock brethren They Might Be Giants, but they're far from sell outs. On first listen, their songs are funny stories about surreal things, but if you continue to listen, they take on a whole new meaning. It might just be me, but Peaches almost sounds like an indictment of capitalism, but you'll have to hear it yourself to get it. In other words, buy this CD, it's the best of the best of the Presidents. And for all of you who think it's stupid music, go back to your Starbucks and yell into your phone some more, you'll never get it."
4,"Works great when an ""invisible"" light fixture is needed","Ordered this lamp to satisfy several requirements we had. We needed a lamp that was visually almost invisible, was excellent for reading, was floor-standing, and would fit behind a wall hugging recliner in a corner room position. It met all of these requirements perfectly. The only issues relate to satisfactorily tightening of the post to base and of the tilt arm. Concerned with overtightening, both tend to loosen up a bit with contact."
4,easy to read and comprehend,easy tool for first timers or young people who are starting making presentations. this was an easy read and easy to apply.
3,Things I learned in Architecture School & The Military,"This books isn't a bad purchase for the price...it's a low cost, handy reference. It is worth the cover price, but most of what it teaches, I have already learned through attending that High Priced University and by joining the Military (Death by Power Point!) I guess it always helps to have a refresher course, and something to refer to in a tight spot. Design, remembering your audience, and how to speak in front of people...maybe I could have saved the college tuition if I had this book 10 years ago! Enjoy it when you get your copy!"
3,"The ""None"" tracks are worth the cost...","The last four tracks on this re-release, from the 94 EP None, are worth the cost of this album. They are raw, punnishing, complicated, always on the edge of your seat awesome songs. My legs hurt after listening to these songs while driving my car because I simply cannot sit still with the rythym. The first 2/3 of this album lacks that entirely, and is dime-a-dozen heavy metal with a little speed here and there (not quite death metal or black metal). Some of the tunes are ok here and there, but easily forgettable. This album is 1/3 five stars, and 2/3 2 stars, so that works out to be 3 stars. Since the last 4 tracks were written in 94, and the first tracks were written in 91, it is evidence that Meshuggah has matured, and this means I will be purchasing more Meshuggah track sfrom after 1994. Good Metal just might be the hardest of the music genres to write for."
2,Technical but not great,"This was the first (and probably last) Meshuggah album I bought.This music is all a technical display and really isn't thatmusical. And most of the ""technical"" is a naive (boring) displayof some Jazz technique (chords, rhythym). The new Metallicaalbum is way better than anything Meshuggah can produce (probablywhy they sold > 1 million copies in a week? ...)Generally, the technical aspects of music are really just theunderlying mechanics and not much else. This group soundslike they're practicing for the real thing (as many of thethousands of Heavy Metal bands sound !)"
2,Bit of a disappointment,"I thought with the great cast this was sure to be enjoyable. Sadly all the great acting in the world, the sublime scenery of Tuscany, and the beautiful cinematography couldn't stitch together the patchy characterisation and gaps in the storyline. I must read the book to see if I can work out what went wrong. It just didn't work for me."
3,A good movie,"This is a good Victorian movie fraught with drama and a good ending. I only wish the dvd had subtitles because the sound has a lot to be desired. The dialogue is so important, but hard to catch all because of the English intonations and the sound goes soft to loud inconsistently. The characters and their restrained English upbringing is very interesting to watch because so much can be read between the lines without verbal explanation which Americans tend to do. A little slow sometimes and a little unbelievable, but a good old English film."
3,Could have been better...,I really love the players in this movie but the story kind of left me cold. I had expected more.
1,Where Angels Fear to tread,"""Angels Fear to Tread"".What a miserable and negative story! My wife and I were glad when it was over, hoping that it would become more positive at the end.There was too much stupid and pointless physical fisticuffs between the families. The lighting was miserably dark and drab. Helen Mirren was wasted. Helena Bonham Carter acted like a piece of wood throughout the film, or like someone who didn't want to be in it in the first place. When she said, ""I love Dino"", it was so emotionless that Dino could have been a dog, not a man --not that Dino had ever shown any interest in her anyway.A real waste of time and money, and I threw the DVD into the trash."
5,This book should be in Every child's room!,"I was at the public library sometime ago, and a friend showed me their copy of this book. I checked it out and now my children wish they owned it. They love Clyde's poetry and Wendy's illustrations. I would like to buy a copy for the whole family. I'm dissapointed that it's out of print. I insist on a re-print!"
2,Unnecessarily obscure,"Saul presents some intriguing and pertinent ideas in Equilibrium. Moreover, they are understandable ideas. At least they would have been understandable if he had taken the time to write a book that didn't have to be deciphered."
2,Custom does not mean customizable,"I am sure these wires are fine for replacement of the stock wires, but I would not call these ""custom"" wires. Based on the product description I thought I would be able to cut these to fit my ""custom"" needs. This is not true. They come already cut and assembled to length and therefore will not work if your ""custom"" project truly requires ""custom"" length wires."
2,You get what you pay for.,The quality of the lens is very poor. All in all it was what I expected. Later went on to buy a TCON by Olympus which was very good! Well at least I got a bag out of the deal.
4,The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid,This is one of the best movies made about the Northfield Minnesota Raid today. It features a great list of actors and follows the historical details of the the actual raid fairly well. The film has just enough Hollywood in it to make it very entertaining.
5,Honestl Awesome Coffe and Tea,"I purchased a Chemex 8-cup coffee maker recently and it is truly wonderful. Using the Chemex filters, it takes 5-8 minutes to brew four cups of coffee. The wait is certainly worthwhile as the resulting brew is clean and flavorful. How much of this is attributable to the filters, I cannot say. But, I will only use Chemex filters with my Chemex coffee maker as the combo delivers enjoyablr coffee. At this price point, this coffee maker and filter combo beats a french press anyday!"
5,Best on the market,"Having tried other filters, I returned to these because they are the strongest and easiest to use. The square design was initially a surprise, but I've noticed that it helps contain splatter while pouring water over the ground coffee. They can be somewhat pricy, so I have been known to rinse and dry them to get two uses out of one filter. As I stated, they are strong! I have used the bleached and the brown filters and found both to be high quality. Give them a try - you won't be disappointed."
5,Chemex is my lifelong coffee maker!,"I have used a Chemex coffee maker since 1969 when I got married and recieved one as a gift from some musical hippy friends. I have loved it ever since and have loved the rich strong, clear coffee it brews. So...of course I use Chemex filters."
5,Very Nice Set_Nostalgic,"This set is very nicely done. I love showing my granddaughters how we took such pride in our Girl Scout uniforms back in ""our day"". They can't wait to play with them. The little descriptions on back of the outfits tell the story add so much life to them and the diaries of the girls give a peek into the past. The paper is high quality and the details are so good."
2,Poor MP3 player,It looks good but the music quality is very poor. I'm very surprise Skull Candy release this product with this low level sound quality.You have to use a special earphones and USB cable to use this watch and I was not able to find replacement parts if I lose or break the ones that came with it.It also is USB 1.1 not USB2. SkullCandy stop making this model so you don't see them on their web site.They also make a 512mb model which comes with a different retractable wire headset compare to the plain long wire headset that comes with the 1gb headset.
5,No complaints,"I'm using this to back up my Mac. I have Leopard, and I just plugged it in, clicked a couple of responses and It's been working fine. The price was good; it has more than enough space for everything I want to do. It was perfect plug and play. It's hard to judge reliability after only a couple of months, but so far, so good."
4,Good Price,For about $100 this unit cannot be beat. I use it with Acronis True Image 11 software and make incremental backups of my hard drive weekly. So far it has performed fine and with its small footprint takes up very little valuable desk space. I have found if a hard drive works fine for the first month it usually will not be a problem in the near future. This drive has passed that test!
5,Cheap for what you get,This hard drive is really cheap if you imagine that you have 500 gigabites. There are lots more hard drives that cost much more and offer much less.The set up is really simple and it works as it should. I'm very happy withy my purchase!
4,Still working!,"Bought this in June 2008. I've dropped the drive and accidentally unplugged it while on and still have never had disk issues. I use it for music production, photos and media storage. It's over 70% full now so I just ordered another Iomega drive w/larger capacity. I'm going to use the new drive for back-up and my original drive as the working drive. Drives eventually fail so I'm going to buy me some peace of mind with the 2nd drive I'm getting.The power supply wires are feeble though. Carrying it in my laptop bag and going from place to place forced me to re splice the power supply wires couple of months ago since they frayed and it wouldn't turn on.I've read the reviews from others where they've had issues with their drives. I haven't had any majors issues. I'll close this review by saying that 2+ years of using and abusing this bulky but trusty drive allow me to give it a 4 star rating. Can't give it a 5 star b/c of the frail wires that are used for power/USB."
4,Review this,"Iomega products have consistently been a reliable brand. As my external storage capacity needs have increased, Iomega has been able to offer reasonably priced, dependable solutions. The 500GB drive is simple to use right out of the box. It doesn't take near as much room my telephone and is relatively silent when in operation. I found myself wishing for faster read/write speeds when first transferring intense number of files but on daily use it is sufficient. Good product."
1,Lost All My Data,"With an established name like IOMEGA gets endorsed by a Company that sets high standards that APPLE does, you would expect IOMEGA to design a device that will protect your data, and be there in an event that files get damaged or lost. The drive lasted me about 5 months. I noticed a warning sign when my OS said it had to index the drive after it was working fine all those months. The following day, the drive would not mount. It would turn on and make a cracking popcorn noise but never show up on the desktop. This was my easy method of backup. Fortunately I have data stored on both external drives and DVD data disks, so no real loss of data occurred. However it is taking me days to get all of my data back onto my main hard drive to begin the Time Machine Process with a new drive from a well trusted company called Western Digital. I have never had a problem with Western Digital and have four of them on my computer now. This was my first, and LAST IOMEGA product."
4,Good Product,"Product functions as described. Good overall, but seems a little slow to connect with my PC."
2,50/50 on this,bought 2 of these; one for work and one for home. The one for work died after a few months - can't even reformat it.
5,Excellent back up drive,"It is true plug-and-play, the drive was immediately and quickly recognized, no problems there. I reformatted from FAT32 to NTFS for XP. Primarily used as a backup drive with Acronis true Image software. Backs up easily and I have had to restore my drive (operating system) once already. I have not had any noise problems or case heating up. The best part is that this drive can be switched off, and turned on only when needed."
1,Disappointing reliability,"Drive ""died"" after about two weeks use once my son had transferred most of his key files to it.Very poor"
3,Iomega USB external hard drive.,"-- Iomega 500GB USB external drive --Easy to use - just plug in to any USB port. Very large capacity, especially for the price. Lights up when on. Sleek looking. Includes handy on/off switch. Comes with cube-shaped power brick. Well built - it flopped over while running under my desk (I kicked it) and it didn't miss a beat. I wish the stand was wider (better to leave stand off and lay it on its side if under a desk). Slow data tranfer (a result of the USB link I think). USB cord is a little short. (I would substitute a longer one but was concerned that might slow data tranfer). All-in-all a good product to use for backup. I did not install any Iomega software - just used it as an extra drive."
4,Externial Drive,"This is my third Iomega drive. This drive works well, no problem with hook up. It's a little big, size wise, and it dose make fan noise more than my other Iomega's external drives. Other than that,works very well and should hold up for a long time."
4,Its Good...,"My only issue with the album is the ""western production."" That's why I give it 4 stars. Now seeing how a previous reviewer said "" good thing he was shot"".....that's not even a comment that needs to be made about Peter. Now ALOT of the ""musicians"" (including the corny ""poppy rock"" groups of today....that can apply to.) Peter was great. My interpretation of Peter music was: This IS how the world is today, what can YOU, who listen to my music, do about it. While Bob was: Wouldnt it be nice IF life was peaceful, upfull, majestic and Irie!!! So thats the difference, not entirely, but the overall vibe of both of them. Now this albums lyrics and riddims (""see thru"" the overproduction,)was exceptional. I wish there could be like a ""Jamaican Version"" to this album, Like ""Catch A Fire"" just bare... otherwize I have no other tiffs with this one. Otherwise, thank you Peter for you everlasting gifts of Music!!"
4,A Great Value!,"Once again, Naxos has done a fine jobe with this cd. It is worth every penny! In these compositions you will not find the breathtaking grandeur and scope of Mozart's later symphonies, but there are some very beautiful melodies here that I found myself whistling out loud, to the great annoyance of my co-workers! The musicianship of the Northern Chamber is excellent as always, and the sound of this recording is crystal clear. At this price, you can't pass this cd up!"
4,Great Shoe!,"My daughter is a size 12, and these fit perfectly - they were not too tight and she loves wearing them in dance class. My friend bought her daughter a pair of jazz shoes at Payless for the same price ($26), and her daughter was complaining that they were too tight - those shoes were also a size 12. I highly recommend these.Gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the seller doesn't provide amazon prime shipping option."
5,A great album,"This album is a refreshing phase-shift from the blase pop-culture that constrains so much of modern rock music. Every track on this great album has you tapping your toes by the second bar, and his wonderful harmonies and his ever evolving scores and musical surprises leaves you gasping for more as each track fades to the next. You need a really good stereo as there really is so much going on. Tim's songs are simple songs done oh, so well.I have to admit that every day I drive to work 25 miles - and I'm thankfull that Tim Finn keeps me company"
1,boring hip-hop,"So disappointed by this MK effort. There has been no noticeable skill progression since their debut. In fact most of the songs on here sound like the could've come off '4 track mind'. The beats are the main issue here. There is actually one song that uses a Led Zepplin drum break and a guitar loop, not very creative and gets boring fast. If you're trying to stay true to hip hop at least be innovative along the way. Guest Mc's and outside production are desperately needed.In all fairness, maybe the Mudkids have corrected these issues, but I wouldn't know, they lost my support after this effort."
5,The baby is here and my daughter still wants to read this book!,"I love this book. Dr Sears is an advocate for attachment parenting. This book offers useful sections about attachment parenting and suggestions for helping prepare an older sibling for a new baby. It was priceless for my 3 year old in understanding that babies do not play from day one, that they require a lot of attention, and that she is still as special as she always has been. I knew my daughter had learned from this book the day she corrected me by saying that the baby was in a baby holder called a uterus, not a belly."
4,Nice book,"It was a nice book to explain the differences that will happen when a new baby comes home, but not the best. A few of the topics were discussed at length--too detailed for a 2.5 year old."
5,Brings back memories from Ireland...,"Yes, This brings back memories from Dublin when I first saw and heard this great band on the BBC's Old Grey Whistle Test program that aired in the late evening.I bought two of their records and both were good listening but sadly got damaged since.My friend has kindly bought me a couble of their CDs for a Christmas present. I am delightd and can't wait to hear them again.Best wishes, Fischer Z fans."
2,long Fortune Magazine Article.,"The book reads like a long Fortune Magazine article, I feel ripped off for my money.As someone said, its an interesting ""People's Magazine"" history of an interesting firm, however, the writing style is pretty bad. Words like ""shady, nebulous, sordid"" appear on every page, but the actions described are pretty typical/boring and not that crazy. i.e, some treasurer in Connecticut gets caught in a bribe involving a 750 Million dollar investment, and 10 million gets eventually funneled to Carlyle group, who cares? If anything it shows a witch hunt against the firm.Despite the language, the book either implies 1) Briody could not find any real dirt or 2) Carlyle Group may have a tremendous conflict of interest but to date, it has not done anything that bad..that can be proven.A poor treatment of an important topic. I just read Caro's bio of Johnson, the juxposition of reading the two makes the book even worse in my eyes, perhaps unfairly so."
1,Authors get a major issue wrong,"The authors claim on page 57-58 that the ABA allows ""rounding up"" to the nearest increment. This is true, but not nearly to the extent the authors would have you believe. The ABA opinion allows the attorney to ""round up"" from 5.5 minutes to 6. But rounding up from 1 minute to 15 (as the authors claim is ""OK'd"" by the ABA), is totally unethical. Beware of following the authors' advice on this point--round up to the nearest minute=ok. Rounding up more than 1 or 2 minutes=fraud."
3,Scrap is the operative word here,"His journal of the making of ""A Summer in St. Tropez"" is a better book if your criteria for selection is nude photos of young women. Though to give it its due, ""Bilitis"" features several young actresses who were at their prime when they did this movie. Read one review in which the reviewer griped that they were over 18. Well that is not a bad thing in my mind. A little offbeat for Hamilton and not one of his better books."
2,Nothing Special,"This was okay. I thought that Lovina was pretty insensitive to every body else in their time of need. Rudolph didn't do to well w/ this one, it's not written good @ all. I wouldn't read it again. My suggestion to you is this: if u can get this book free or cheap, then go ahead, read it, but it's not really worth reading."
2,"Pictures are adorable, but not such a great read aloud","I bought the book because of the gorgeous pictures, very pleasurable to look at. Reading it out loud went from fun to progressively more of a chore; I was glad to finally reach the end. The story started to stumble towards the middle. My daughters never asked me to read it again, though they did enjoy looking at the pictures."
2,Fun Movie; Cruddy DVD,"This famous Shaw Brothers title is pretty entertaining, but is badly let down by a substandard presentation. It appears to have been mastered from an old VHS tape, and the picture is full of tape dropout...add to this the audio and digital artifacts and you have a most annoying video experience. The fairly high price adds insult to injury; I've bought DVDs for $5.00 that play far better. I haven't gotten any discs from this particular company before, and I'm not likely to do so again...buy if you must, but be forewarned."
1,Don't buy!,"One of the greatest musicals of all times - fast moving, fresh, daring, unbelievable camerawork and choreography but don't buy this edition. The wide screen version is missing and the print is poor!"
2,Don't Buy the Westlake Entertainment Group Edition,"The Westlake Entertainment Group transfer to DVD from the Warner original is exceptionally dark in color, more suited to film noir than a once-brightly colored musical comedy. Great film, bad print! Look for the Warner Home Video Edition.The Pajama Game"
2,the pajama Game,"The Pajama Game and Damm Yankees which I purchased in January, the sound was not good. I had to turn my TV sound up to its highest level in order to hear. I was very disapointed with the sound quality."
4,Sidi Genius 5 Women's,"Excellent road shoe, I love the stiff carbon sole and the wider than most toe box. Sizes runs a little bigger than other brands."
3,Bit of a disappointment,"The title of this book should have been, ""I passed gas and there lay a book"" as this book slowly trudges along as Steve talks about his progression into F1. I've followed F1 since '86 watched all the races, read many a magazine and many books from the sports greats, and this book was by far the worst. Several chapters are used to talk about how he got a book deal, and how he was interviewed as a mechanic by British radio which came across as rather boring. I also found it aggravating reading Steve talk about the do's and don'ts of the sports rules as he comes across as a nerdy engineer. His insight on the Benetton team was largely a biased 'we were right, they are wrong' scenario. I couldn't wait to finish the book so I could toss it aside and ended up skipping many of the last pages."
3,"A quick, but somewhat disappointing, read","As another reviewer has noted, this book is more about the peripherary of F1 than what really goes on in the pits. I was looking for a bit more technical insight into what goes into a winning F1 effort -- how, really, does a team go from also-ran, to winner, and back to also-ran in a few years -- but instead there was much more about the travel schedule, working conditions, and atmospherics. Matchett is a good commentator, seems like a likeable fellow and has written a plesant enough book, but the insight into F1 technology and team dynamics is only so-so."
3,An Odd Bird,"I sometimes struggle with biographies (although they're not nearly as boorish as many autobiographies). This was was fairly interesting, though, if for no other reason than the fact that Capote was so unusual. The high society peek was also entertaining."
3,okay,The one thing doddering party boy Plimpton is good for is doing these oral bios. They're shallow fun. Except they're probably thrown together by his assistants anyway.
5,Beautiful and informative book,Peggy McNamara and the people at the Division of Insects at the Field Museum have produced a wonderful book on the insects and spiders of Illinois. The paintings are beautiful and the text informative. The book gives the reader an appreciation of the little forms of life that inhabit the state of Illinois. Perhaps this book will keep people from stepping on or spraying an insect or spider when they know more about it.Maggie Daley wrote the introduction but I don't think she should be listed as first author of the book.
5,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CD IN ROCK HISTORY,PAISELLI AND HERRWIG ARE SOME OF THE BEST WRITERS IN ROCK HISTORY NOT TO MENTION HERRWIGS GUITAR WORK ALONG WITH PALSELLIS VOICE THIS CD CAN NOT DUPICATED
5,A goodbar soundtrack,"Practically all the tunes are catchy. Also, each and every song is heard in the film. The songs match the films content. Sound quality could be better- don't think this was digitally remastered."
5,VERY STRONG ALBUM FROM TOSH,"This 1981 album is far superior to even classics like Mama Africa, because it is grittier in sound and has more variety in the songwriting. This album was underrated when it was first-released. But, remastered with extra tracks, it must be re-evaluated as the classic album from Tosh that it is! It is not as great as Equal Rights, but it is still EXCELLENT Peter Tosh, with classic tracks like Coming in Hot and Fools Die (For Want of Wisdom). Great Peter Tosh listening experience."
5,A Must Have for Any Serious Writer,"A Writer's Reference is a must have for any serious writer. As a full time university student majoring in Writing and minoring in English this book is my life. It was a required text for my very first class at the college level, and the professor told us that if we could keep only one book in our college careers this would be the one to keep. Thank God I listened. I couldn't live or write well without it."
5,No bones about it,"What a delightful read. With a witty pen and great examples, Nichols has crafted a wonderful book for pet owners who want to capture important moments on film. There are tips for those of us with modest camera skills and even some for professionals.Bravo!"
2,Out dated book,"The book has great information regarding how to take great pet pictures; however, it is outdated when it comes to technology."
2,"Cute & entertaining, not very useful","I expected more from this book, but it's really little more than a ""greeting card"" sort of book- full of cute drawings and cute little sayings encouraging women to feel good about themselves and wear what they really like. No revelations about fashion, body type, or style, and actually very little of any substance. Nothing that a woman with an ounce of common sense hasn't already figured out. You get more actual fashion advice from the average Oprah magazine.(And oh by the way, when Eleanor Roosevelt said ""You must do the thing you think you cannot do"", I doubt she was talking about trying on tops.)In a nutshell- don't buy this book! Borrow it from the library or from a friend, read it (takes about a half hour), and then return it, congratulating yourself that you didn't spend money on it."
4,Tasty,"Good white chocolate, in a world bereft of quality white chocolate made with actual cocoa butter. Try it, I enjoyed it. A little pricey, but makes for a nice indulgance."
2,"Warning, do not expect it to work with non-Sony phones","I have a Motorola RAZR and an HBH-608 Sony Ericsson Bluetooth headset. After 2 months it stopped transmitting, though it continued to link and I could hear the other side saying ""Hello? Hello?"" Nowhere does SE say this product is guaranteed only for use with SE phones so they refused warranty service. Only after many angery words did they proceed to cover the item, but they don't claim it will work any better. Consider yourself warned!"
1,AWFUL BOOK THAT OFFERS NO PROOF,This book is very disappointing. It doesn't not offer any information that can be backed up with proof. I would not recommend this book to any one. I think it should never have been written. Don't waste your money buying it. The author is not a hair care professional. How can she write a book about something she has no experience with? Save your money. There are better books out there. Some people will do anything to make money. I had the feeling I was robbed after I read this book. Please don't waste your time reading this terrible book!
3,Thin So Fast...reveiwed,"This book has a program that is comparable to Optifast, which is a diet that was popularized by Oprah Winfrey in the eighties. The difference is that you get one regular meal a day. This book also offers a transition phase and a maintence pahse, which are comparable to The Atkins Diet. There are many delicious recipes and helpful tools to help you lose weight and keep it off. I found this book interesting and helpful. And... did you know that there is a flour like product that is made from wood. Strange but true. And last but not least.... if you are looking for a lifestyle change and a low carbohydrate diet this book will help you to take off the unwanted fat and help you to keep it off."
3,Good selections poor performances,As the title suggests the pieces are very well chosen and this could be a great introduction to Mozart's music but you have to look elsewhere for better interpretations of these masterpieces.
5,"Cuando se pone uno a dieta con cualquier libro,",se pone uno en peligro: LA DESNUTRICION ES LA PUERTA DE ENTRADA DE MUCHAS ENFERMEDADES FISICAS Y EMOCIONALES.Estas dietas son eficaces y BIEN BALANCEADAS. NO te dejan con hambre ni te sientes agotado a la semana de estarlas haciendo
2,Two different movies: urban satire & rural comedy,"After a fairly bright beginning(with Doris Day brightly wisecracking her way around four unruly kids--all boys--a dog, a maid, and her clucking theater-critic husband), this film version of Jean Kerr's popular book takes a left turn into the country and never recovers. Doris is much preferable playing smart, attractive working women than a bucolic housewife, and there's never any chemistry between she and David Niven. Janis Paige is fun as a theater starlet, and Doris is always worth watching, but interest wanes in these ""Daisies"" after about an hour."
2,Big disappointment!,"While I remain a fan of Doris Day in her great comedies (Pillow Talk, Send me no Flowers, Lover Come Back), I must say this one was a big disappointment! The plot is lacking dramatic logic, the puns are stale, and the protagonists are not credible."
4,Please Don't Eat the Daisies,"This story is about a man and woman who think country life will be good for the kids. They end up finding that moving to the country has a whole new set of rules and problems. You know, the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence until you get there. It also shows how couples work out their problems in a 2 home marriage, despite misunderstandings. Great movie, and great actors."
4,Thorough Commentary on Revelation,"Comprehensive compilation of biblical, historical and literary analyses and commentary on the Book of Revelation."
3,Clunky and Cumbersome - C+,"The Hummer X-Player is made by CONAIR, they make great hair dryers but fall short in the CD-Player making sector.PROS: *Plays MP3s and WMA format CD-Rs and CD-RWs*Can play without headphones (sound is weak)*Has two headphone jacks*Looks really cool and tough*Is water resistant (but don't try it at home)CONS: *Is actually kind of fragile*MP3s and WMAs must meet specified size, bitrate and 44Hzotherwise player will freeze, stall, and possibly becomedamaged.*Comes with the lowest quality headphones known to man.*Drains batteries like only a Hummer could.*Radio reception is not very good.*Switching from batteries to AC-adapter without firstshutting-down causes freezing, stalling, and possiblydamage.Don't recommend for anyone but true die-hard Hummer fans."
1,John Hagee,"Don't know what happened to his theology but he has become one of the money hungry, truth bending false prophets the Bible talks about."
5,A Life-Influencing Masterpiece,"This book helped me work through my grief after the demise of a much-loved uncle. The story demonstrates the inevitability of death for every living thing, in the process proving the theory that it is the ride, and not the destination, that matters. My uncle had lived well, so the novel's theme brought me great comfort. And this work's underlying subtext is that love, in all its forms, is the greatest power. I treasured this book, these characters, the town in which it was set. The values that the characters held were nothing more than simple morality, but these were the very values that made America so great. Reading AND LADIES OF THE CLUB helped me to come to terms with all of these realities. It is a very powerful novel."
3,It fits. Don't know if it works. Not for toilet.,"Seemed like a good idea for my weekend home. The part fits and works for the icemaker and dishwasher. The version for the toilet does now work. Will not let enough water in to fill the tank.Now, I don't know if they actually work in an emergency until I have an emergency. It seems that you will never know if it works, only if it does not."
5,Beautifully Crafted!,"Having read ""Winter Range"" and found it lacking, I only read ""Season of the Snake"" on the recommendation of a family member. I was thrilled by it!! Her previously dark writing has found real focus and structure. ""Season of the Snake"" does a great job getting you to care about the characters, and although you may think you know where it is going... it either takes you there in such a unique fashion, or twists how far and where it goes... that the whole ride is a joy. Truly got under my skin and sucked me in. Great Book!"
2,Not my type!,"Well, this cologne is cheap and you cannot go wrong with such cheap cologne. But this cologne is not usable. It has weird floral like scent and definitely as a guy I didn't like it. Moreover the scent is so strong that everyone around would notice the scent. So, for me there is no use of it. At the end of the day you get what you pay for."
2,Not as described,"The wire looks just like the picture, but the description says Includes 3.5mm mini-pins (4) and there is none such in the package.Interestingly, my package came from the returns center, where it is going back to."
2,A bone to pick,"The Sonata and the 44 Duos are wonderful pieces to be sure, and Pauk's interpretation is good. However, the sound quality on this and every other Naxos recording I have ever heard is bad. Do Bartok the courtesy of listening to a good recording of this fantastic music."
3,nothing special,"I LOVE silverchair but this was a disapointment. If you are a hardcore fan, like me, and have all the singles, b-sides, soundtracks, and the Freak Box you already have copies of most if not all of these songs. The only advantage is to have it all on one CD and not have the songs spread out over mass quantities of CD's. For serious 'chair fans it's great just to have in your collection, but other wise, don't give their former record company another way to make money off of you or their former clients."
1,Junk - Very Noisy Cables,"This is my first review on Amazon. It's not normally something I would do, but I thought I might be able to save somebody some grief.I bought theses cables, including the 25' cable, a 1.5' cable and two of the Y cables, thinking they would be a little upgrade from the cheaper cables I had.They were not. These cables are junk.They pick up noise from everything. My stereo systems were relatively quiet before. When I connected these, and ran the 25' along a wall, that amplifier became noisy. I also had a little USB fan connected to my computer. You could almost hear every turn of the blades in both of my amplifiers.I even had to take out the 1.5' cable and both of the Y's to get rid of all the noise they were picking up and introducing into the systems, even with the fan disconnected.They are very pretty cables, but if you want something quiet, look elsewhere.I should have heeded Roy Sprowl's review on the 1.5' cable. I recommended that you do so."
3,"great music, subpar sound","I'm neither a musician nor musicologist, just someone who enjoys all classical music. I love the music on this recording and the performance by the Oxford Camerata, but on my system, and to my ears, the voices have a consistent raspy overtone that I find quite disturbing. Generally, I don't notice this effect on SACD recordings nor on the LPs I listen to at my friends' houses. I think it's an artifact of the ""redbook"" (regular) CD recording format, which is not capable of accurately representing high frequency overtones (maximum of 44 KHZ). But not all CDs have that raspy sound. It may be that some use some processing to eliminate it and some don't. I've noticed it more on Naxos CDs; less on Arte Nova, Telarc, and DG. But label is no guarantee.It's unfortunate, because I'd like to listen to this disc more than I do. This is why I've given it only three stars."
3,Could be better,"Having been lucky enough to be trained by Mr. Dolinger, I can say that he is truly an amazing salesman. However, Mr. Dolinger, who looks exactly like Christopher Reeves in ""Superman"", could've written a better book. I know Jim knows his stuff, but he just doesn't reveal anything new here. I think this could've been a much better book if he could explain some of his own personal sales techniques, instead of someone elses. If he could explain how he can entertain a group of people for hours, having them totally captivated and in awe, or how he uses humor and makes artful use of stories and metaphors, then this book would be great. I think this book is good if you've never sold anything in your life, but if you want some really powerful techniques, I would suggest checking out anything by Richard Bandler, Kenrick Cleveland, and ""Unlimited Selling Power"" by Donald Moine and Kenneth Lloyd."
5,Perfect for tiny hands first learning to grasp,"This was my baby's first toy. It is soft, easy to hold, and truly her first favorite thing.PROS: The tiny slots are perfect for tiny hands first learning to grasp.CONS: I wish it came in pinkWould I recommend it? YES!"
5,Awesome with or without a brush,"An amazing, luxurious shave cream! I used this with and without a brush and got a comfortable, close shave with each method. I used it with a regular cartridge razor (Gillette Pro Glide) and still got a great shave. A little goes a LONG way, especially when using a brush so this tube will last a long time. I use it exclusively when traveling because of the convenience of the small tube. It is hard to find such a quality shave cream in a travel size tube. Also this is unscented, so its great with your favorite scented after shave/cologne."
5,Great Drama,This is a excellent drama! Rick Martin (Kirk Douglas) is a man who as a child peeked through the window one night into a Night Club and saw a person playing the Trumpet! Well he sees what is happening and he wants to play! The man teaches him and he turns into a big famous movie actoress! Well it ends up in a big nice story! This is an excellent movie and I promise you that you will deffinately love it he gets married to Amy North (Lauren Bacall) but then finds out that she is the wrong woman for him the girl who he really loves is Jo Jordan (Doris Day) this is a great movie that you will enjoy!
4,I love this book,"I love this book, i rpeviously read it from a different publisher but this format is also nice. Its a new book; i am happy with my purchase."
4,Can't beat the Slip on technology,"These are good looking, comfortable shoes, for a reasonable price. They aren't the most cushioned shoe, but feel quite solid."
3,good shoes,"I've reviewed these-several times before! They fit & wear very well ! They are very comfortable- & you can buy in several different colors/tones- even Elvis's ""blue suede shoes!"
4,Like them,"They serve the purpose that I got them for.. I keep them near my table tennis table and slip them on to play. Comfortable, can move well in them."
4,Excellent Oracle Source,This source book is exactly what I was looking for. I am using it to supplement my Oracle course work and will keep it close at work. The index could be a little better though.
5,"Finally, a developer book worth having on my bookshelf","There are plenty of beginner books on the market, and some are actually helpful. There was one question that was never answered though -- ""OK, I can build a block. Now what? "" Peter and Paul have answered this question perfectly. So well in fact that the 1 copy I bought for the office is not enough. This book has become mandatory for my employees to have in their library.Top this off with the interview questions they provide for managers and this book is the most well rounded book to date. If you, or any of your people, are using Developer for your projects, this book is a must."
1,Ridiculous and insulting to both men and women,"I struggled with anger during reading this book. It might say that it will help women to give up being a control freak but what it really does is telling them to give up all responsibility for their lives and be a blind follower. I am sorry but that is utter BS. If your only way to stay in your marriage is to follow the advice in this book, then you are not in a marriage. You are enslaved. Marriage is about partnership, about sharing the good and the bad and having an equal voice. It takes work and not surrender.I am now going to burn this book in the stove... if I can figure out how to turn it on!!!!"
2,WHAT??,"I have one question: could Doyle have found something else to do with her time? I first saw the television interview with her and was intrigued so I read the book. What a waste of time. While I'm well aware that its hard to CHANGE other people, I fail to see how doing what Doyle advocates gives me any sort of control. Chances are if you follow the advice in this book, you will become even mroe miserable."
3,A guide for control freaks,"From the looks of these reviews it seems like there are two types of responses to this book. There are people in healthy give-and-take relationships who think this book is ridiculous and then there are divorced control freaks who wish they had read this book earlier. The control freaks who love the book relate to it for two reasons. First, because the author assumes that relationships are about control, just like they do, and second, because their controlling ways [destroyed] past relationships and now they're finding out why. For them, this book is a revelation. Those who understood before they picked up the book that relationships are not hierarchies but collaborations see this book as drivel. This book is not for healthy relationships. It's about swinging the pendulum from one extreme to the other."
3,Motivations Questionable,"I recommend this book with reservations. Doyle makes good points about allowing your husband to be a grown man, but it reads more as a manual for ""how to get everything you want."" In other words, the focus is on your wants, needs, and desires ~ not on learning to show unconditional, supportive love.However, the book is not without its good points. I especially agree with her short discussion regarding what a man means when he asks you what you think about a possible decision. He's not asking for your opinion as much as he's asking for your encouragement and support. He wants to hear that you enthusiastically believe in his ability to handle the situation successfully."
2,A little too extreme,"I understand the premise here. However, every relationship is different and the approach this book describes is not really beneficial for either the wife or husband. I do agree that we at times forget to recognize all that our husbands do and feel they should be appreciated more (which is why I gave this a 2) but the book is behind in times. I recommend if you are seeking advice on how you should approach your relationship with your husband... talk to your hubby or Pastor."
3,Great Advice,"I thought that this book would be controversial, but after I read the book I changed my mind. The ideas it presesnts are actually not that far fetched. The wife is not really surrendering, she relinquishes micro-managing. Let's face it, adults never like to be told what to do. I see it all the time in several aspects of life, even at work. Adults feel that as adults they have earned the right to use their own brains to make decisions and execute them. Doyle articulates this point beautifully; she points out how to negotion and navigate a household with your husband. No woman likes to nag and say the same things over and over to an adult. After reading Doyle's book I realized that there is a better way."
1,the surrendered wife,"I found this offering to be an insult to all the women of past generations who have tried to climb out of the firepits of prehistoric caves. All the women who have been told they must risk death to have babies, all the women who have been told they are less than their male counterparts and to all of our daughters who we tell to become whatever they dream. surrender? I suggest it only as a tool to see what we as modern wives are up against."
5,"If You Only Buy One Book to Fix Your Husband Or Boyfriend, Buy This One.","I've read a lot of books about dating and choosing who to stay the course with and who to let go of, and how to handle yourself at that level. I'm seeing someone exclusively now, so I moved on from SURRENDERED SINGLE to THE SURRENDERED WIFE. This book has improved my relationship like no other, except for RELATIONSHIP RESCUE, which is totally different and improved other things than THE SURRENDERED WIFE did. These two are my Top 2 I recommend to friends. (I also recommend GETTING TO COMMITMENT if there are any commitment issues on your part or his, coming up at any stage of dating, relationship or marriage.)There's so much to say about this book, but I'm going to leave this review short. Just get this one.I mentioned my top 2 relationship books, and I'm going to mention my third favorite. WHY MEN LOVE BITCHES. The title sounds bad, but it's not about being mean; it's helped my relationship, too."
4,America Screams,"I taped this from television when I was nine years old and must have watched it a thousand times afterwards. Vincent Price gives a great history of rollercoasters starting with La Marcus Thomson and Coney Island to modern day (late 70's) rides. Includes construction footage of Colossus at Magic Mountain, video of Arrow's suspended prototype, an interview with Karl Bacon of Arrow, plus lots of ride footage of coasters from around the country."
2,Not yet received,It was supposed to be sent but it has not arrived. They did email and said they were sending another copy. It has not arrived yet. Would still like to receive the book.
3,$6.95 tiny and affordable,I actually do use this size all the time. They are also handy as spoon rests.
5,great refresher,"I don't know why more people don't use this book or the authors' more advanced version, ""Quantum Mechanics in Chemistry"", but I think they are both fantastic. This book in particular is very clearly written with explicit examples and and relevant end-of-chapter exercises...with detailed solutions to the odds (very rare)! It focuses more on on many-electron problems and methods, which is essential for understanding chemical problems. If your an undrgraduate chemistry major or a beginning graduate student in chemistry who needs a refresher before taking a more advanced class, you would be well served by this book."
5,Great phone,"This is my 2nd phone from Panasonic. My previous one was from GE and it was nightmare. OK, anyway, this feedback isn't for GE but for this Panasonic phone. People complained about battery life - not an issue for me. I keep my phone away from the base for 4 days with no problem (knock on wood). And I did perform massive voice mail check up to make sure no messages are skipped. Every single message was there and there's no problem with the mic on my phone also. I really hope I won't run in to any future problems because I always liked Panasonic. The only con is that this phone isn't expandable .... but who cares :)"
4,"""Bernie"" Should Win At Oscars...But Won't","""Bernie"" is an excellent example of dark comedy. The fact that it is a true story only adds to its allure. Jack Black is a man of multiple talents and each one of those talents seem to age with time like a fine Bordeaux. The acting from all the members of this fine film shine through any darkness that the film possesses allowing the viewer to mix and match their own concoction of tragedy and humor. The actual denizens of the small town, that are used as narrators, seem so flawless in their delivery that one can only be surprised at the final credits when it is revealed that they are not actors.This film is well done on all levels and should not be missed by any person whose tastes in comedy tend to float to the dark side at times."
3,Strange Subject,"I guess this subject is funny to some people, but I found it a little weird. Shirley MacLain's roll was a little disappointing---too similar to Fried Green Tomatoes???"
3,Good movie..maybe not a must see but enjoyable,Good movie..maybe not a must see but enjoyable. Jack Black was really good in this movie too! I had to google the true story and it was very interesting. Like the video at the end of Jack Black meeting the real Benny.
2,The Movie was great but the Video Stream was very poor,"This is a great movie. You'll love it. However, this was our first time to stream a movie using the Amazon system and we were totally NOT impressed. This was supposed to be in HD but the picture was grainy and pixels blurred; nowhere near the quality expected or what we get from Uverse. Additionally, the pause, start, stop features were cumbersome and trying to backup or replay something caused the system to reset - not acceptable. The price was right at about $1.00 which I thought was oddly low but I'd rather pay more and get what I expected. We previously gave up on Netflix due to similar issues and lack of content. We expected much more from Amazon."
5,Great movie!,Not what I was expecting.This movie will make you laugh. It was really well done.We enjoyed this with friends.
5,Couldn't Be Better,"Jack Black is now the best element of his movies and should sing in all of them. This character is believable, over the top, contemptible, and sympathetic all at once. We're not allowed to either dismiss the good nor overlook the bad. I enjoyed the old guy knocking the inbred rednecks 50 miles west of them."
5,Great cast in a true story,"Jack Black plays Bernie Tiede to the hilt in this true story of a mortician who feels trapped by an older woman and ends up killing her so he can escape. It takes the rest of the town a while to figure out he did it.Black also does all of his own singing very nicely, and he plays off of Shirley MacLaine expertly."
5,Very good piece of story telling on a sad little story,Excellent movie and one which thankfully strays well out of the mainstream story of typical hollywood scripts these days. A story worth telling and participating in as a viewer
3,Just OK,"Watched it twice in the hopes that it would be one of those that gets funnier with each viewing. Jack Black always entertains, but this time, once was enough."
4,Good Moviie,"Not your typical Jack Black fare, but a well told story. Jack plays the role dramatically with good results.It was presented in the interview/documentary style, interspersed with dramatic sequences. I don't typically like this manner of presentation, but in this case it held my interest and told a good story based on an actual incident."
5,Brilliant!,"This movie is a gem much like Cedar Rapids. The acting and writing are perfect, and the story will surprise you. It is perfectly executed and a joy to watch. DO NOT MISS this excellent portrayal of crime in small town USA! Side note: It took me a while to figure iut it was Matthew McConaghey in a supporting role...he was amazing!"
5,Watched it Three Times!,"I lOVED this movie! The earlier reviews had me rather confused about content, but I was pleasantly surprised at how easy the format was to follow. I'm from the South and I think most southerners KNOW Bernie. The story line was intriguing -- I was hooked. Jack Black was wonderful in this roll -- it would have been so easy to over-play this part, but he didn't. I sent an email to several friends insisting they rent this movie! I'm going to buy it now."
2,Bernie is boring!,There was no real action to this movie. I ended up walking away from the movie as it was so boring. I am only giving the movie 2 stars because it was not the worse movie I have seen.
3,Bernie,Knowing this movie was based on a true story makes it even more laughable! It was a fun movie. Jack Black is always entertaining.
3,Not very funny.,"Jack Black did a fantastic job in this movie, but it wasn't super funny. It was okay, certainly worth the 99 cents I paid for it."
4,Surprising,"This movie was rather surprising to me, Jack Black as a serious actor is something I had to see. Turns out the movie is pretty good and Jack Black is really the guy who keeps the movie together."
3,weird,"Interesting since it was based on a real story. It could have been done a little better I do think. It was just weird, and it seemed like it took forever to get around to the real story."
4,"Bizarre plot entraps the viewer, the circus holds you to the end.","This story based on a true case demands viewer attention. The humor of art imitating life engages you without notice. I found myself wondering what the next odd twist would reveal and how long the plot would unfold before reaching its end. Then unexpectedly, the dark turn was reached and I found myself routing for the principal character as he confronted his shocking actions. Amazing outcome."
1,Bad Bernie,"I ordered the video, it arrived, it would not play. I attempted to play it in my Blu-ray player and even in my non Blu-ray player. So, I was allowed to receive a replacement at no charge. The new one arrive, again the second one would not play. So I requested a refund and asked to send the second one bcak. I was allowed to do so and I received a refund. Bottom line, thanks but, no thanks. I know things happen and it did. The reason I did not asked for a third....it was on the open market by then. Thanks, Bad Bernie"
2,Couldn't even finish,"This movie was well acted, (especially by Jack Black) but I was soooo sick of the interview style story telling. It felt monotonous, slow and lacked climax."
1,Slow and pointless,Just dont recommend unless you like slow movies! Don't really see the entertainmenat value at all! I almost stopped watching several times but I Paid to see it! I do not recommend
1,"Omg, SO awful!!!","This movie was so terrible! If I was watching it alone, I would have turned it off for sure. Instead, I brought out my laptop and it was SO annoying to have on in the background. The music was stuck in my head for the rest of the night and I was so annoyed I sat through it. Don't do it, it was TERRIBLE!!!"
1,"Long, boring, and repetative.",It went on forever with one interview after another and many people saying the same things. Not funny or interesting.
5,"Funny, sad and enjoyable","Bernie is not for everyone, but if you like a bit of satire with your true-life films, this is right on the money. Jack Black should win an academy award for this!"
3,"4 stars for the tunes, 2 stars for the rythym section","Stanley Clarke and Al Foster are both wonderful musicians, but I don't they mesh well with Tyner for this session. While Foster is capable of playing many styles, Clarke seems to want to play his steady rock/funk style. Foster winds up playing a more rock-like style as well. I think a Dave Holland/Elvin Jones or Christian McBride/Brian Blade-like (that is those musicians or players in their vein) combo would have been better suited for this date.What's up with Telarc? They could really take from some of the other labels on how to package a cd. Boring liner notes with no pictures."
2,Save your money!,"You barely have to read a page or two into the excerpt here to see that you will not get the best advice here. What kind of advice does it give for emphasizing the waist? Low slung pants, cropped tops, and belly piercings. SERIOUSLY? That's about the worst fashion advice I've ever heard. Maybe that's ok for sassy little 15 year olds, but it is the farthest thing from classy, and not usually appropriate or flattering! Honestly, the advice in this book, save for a few words of wisdom from some bona fide experts, is at best fluff, and at worst just plain bad."
4,Good information for all women,"I was quite intrigued with this book, it had some very interesting information most of it was very funny and accurate. A great book to give to a ""girly"" girl as a gift."
5,Another Haydn Winner From Naxos.,"You can't go wrong with any Naxos CD of Haydn's music. Virtually every CD on the market so far is a winner. This CD offers 70 minutes of good value. The Bb Sonata is particularly engaging. It receives a sprightly performance from Jeno Jando. As with other of his recordings, I sometimes am aware of soft grunts and crooning noises, an accompaniment to his piano playing not evident when I heard him in recital in Melbourne."
5,"Raw, Untarnished Kipling!","Much ado has been made lately about Kipling, mainly due to a resurgence of affection for poems like The White Man's Burden. Although this has been brought on by the war on terrorism, Kipling's work will brave the tests of time granting him immortality.Some reviewers have criticized the organization of Complete Verse. The table of contents lists all 500 or so poems in alphabetical order, and the editor provides an index of first lines. What the reader does not get is a scholar's interpretation of Kipling's prose. Although sometimes I enjoy reading another's perspective on the author's intentions, why bias my own experience with the thoughts of another critic? Much better to walk the fields of verse on a virgin path, experiencing Kipling through my own mind.A great compilation of poetry from a splendid author. Bravo!"
4,"Great, powerful music at a bargain price","Another great Naxos recording. Gliere's huge symphony is based on the legend of Il'ya Muromets, the subject of Russian poetry. The symphony's four movements tell the story of Il'ya's adventures, and are full of religious and mythic imagery. Donald Johanos and the Czecho-Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestra capture the force and power of this work, and as mentioned earlier, it's at a bargain price."
3,ok. Pamela Anderson was much better.,Not as funny. Camera work was terrible at the end. no subtitles. fans would only watch this one once.
1,I am royally PO'd,"I was so anxious for this this roast to be released. Yeh, it's a blast to see Shatner talking trash and getting trashed. But that 1 minute little piece of film with Nimoy and Shatner that opened the show IS NOT THERE !!!!!!!!!!WHY THE &*%$# NOT?That one single minute is a brilliant little bit of comedy, brilliantly executed by two people who have been known for their love/hate relationship, and absolutely worth the price of admission. I would buy a DVD of that bit alone. I am sorely dissapointed."
1,Beware--the Cosimo edition is only first half of the Nihongi--it is incomplete,"The Cosimo edition of the Nihongi is only the first half (up to the reign of Buretsu--or Muretsu, according to Aston's rendering of the name). This is probably because the original edition was in two volumes, and the Cosimo edition only reproduces the first volume, while claiming to be the entire Nihongi. The Tuttle editions have both volumes in one book."
3,"Hey Pal, your chariot's double-parked!","Phillip Marlowe in a kilt leaves some unpleasant images for the heterosexual male reader. ""Hey pal, if I wanted more than one Martinus I'd have asked for them!"" Chandler just doesn't translate well to the era and the senatorial class of Imperial Rome. Nevertheless, the plot is good and the pace brisk. I enjoyed the read and the change from the other Roman mystery writers, but I just couldn't find the character believable or even very likable. He's a pretentious clod and always loses his fights with the villains!"
1,Wishart can't write,"The blurb of this novel promised colloquial, breezy writing. ""Aha!"" I thought. ""Just like Lindsey Davis and Janet Evanovich!"" Unfortunately Davis, Evanovich, and just about everyone else, can write rings around David Wishart. On about page 100 I finally gave up in disgust and gave the book to a used book sale at church. Someone else, buying it for fifty cents, may like it better than I. My advice is: go back to writing school, Mr. Wishart."
3,"Boring but fun sometimes, game.","I pre oredered this game and thought it was going to be much better then Allied Assault. Well, i was WRONG. THis isnt a bad game...it is just boring. The same old same old. Jungle after jungle. But the multiplayer is a step up from Allied Assault with different classes and abilities. Still DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOUR SYSTEM DOESN'T MEET THE REQUIREMENTS. I cant play this anymore cause im not allowed to and im selling it soon."
2,something missing,"This game is about WW 2 in the pacific as the title indicates. In this game you follow your character from Pearl Harbor to the southern most point on the Japanese Islands. The major downpoint of this game is that you are more watching a Movie instead of actually playing a video game. Although you get some good playing time in, it isn't completely worth having to watch the videos inbetween playing time"
1,BUYER BEWARE ! ! !,"This book deserves zero stars. Every single chapter and sub-topic section of this book refers you to Volume 2 for more information. It is misleading to state that you can learn any of the following from this book:""Table of contents by chapters:1) Developing a design2) Overall considerations3) Suspension systems4) Basic components5) Accessories6) Construction aspects""Because you cannot not learn to do ANYTHING from this book alone. They might as well charge you $23.99 for a blank book which says SEE VOLUME 2 because this book is useless without volume 2. So unless you are willing to spend over $60 for this information, which I am not. YOU WILL BE STUCK WITH A NON-RETURNABLE USELESS ITEM.After having been ripped off by M. M. Smith. I will try to educate as many people as possible not to trust this author."
1,Volume 1 is not much good without Volume 2,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers - Volume 1 is full of references to Volume 2 and Volume 3 (and I don't think Volume 3 is even in print!). Volume 1 is a good start BUT without Volume 2 it's nothing more than a strategy or planning tool - which is nice but it really doesn't get into any real meat. Don't get me wrong planning is an important step but a whole book on the strategy of building a trailer - give me a break!My advise is to go to the library, borrow Volume 1 and then see if it's what you like THEN buy Volume 2."
1,If you are a design engineer this one might help.,"I purchased this and the ""basic"" volume. The first was too simple and failed to address any ""how to's"", this one would make a good engineer's text. I am a graduate engineer, but I pass on computing the moments of inertia for each potential design. The tables are there, so it would make a passable textbook. If that is what you want to do, this book may be for you. I assume that because of potential liability the author refuses to say (for example), ""Here is the type and gauge steel you need to make the frame of a 7,000 lb GVWR 16 ft car hauler"". The book is of no use to the person who wishes to ""just do it""."
3,"Good book, but not for responsible pet owners","I got this book for our mildew issues. Our house doesn't breath very well. So far the advice has been good (we breath much better now for it), except I find the chapter on pets very disappointing and limited. The only advice the author really offers on dealing with pet allergies is to get rid of the pets. She is obviously not an animal person as she appears to describe pets as dirty (her most experience is talking about her mothers' ill-trained dogs). A lot of my friends who have allergies and pets would toss this book in the trash because of this as they've learned to live with their pets and fantastically manage their allergies at the same time. There's a lot of things you can do to keep pets even when you have allergies (switch pet foods, litters, shampoos, drink apple vinegar cider, vacuum more regularly, groom regularly, etc)."
4,Good Ideas for Reducing Household Allergens and Chemicals,"May's book offers helpful tips to reduce exposure to allergens and chemicals throughout your home. He reminds you to check places that are often overlooked, such as the drain pan under the refrigerator, the drain pan for your A/C unit, and duct work. Something as simple as your old couch might be the trigger for many symptoms. This book is a good start for someone who wants to try anything they can to reduce their chemical and allergen load."
2,You should know...,"I did not like this cd because I do not pray with the informal ""You""and ""Your"" with reference to Mary in the Hail Mary's. I have always used ""Thee"" and ""Thou."" If you do too, then this is not the right CD for you. I wish I would have known prior to ordering."
5,Exotic and down home recipes accompanied by great stories,"I discovered Pat Conroy several years ago through my daughter, an avid reader of southern novelists. Since then I have read most of his novels, but rejected any interest in the cookbook, thinking it was just another recipe collection until my wife gave me a copy. However, no other writer packs stories with such lyrical language and depth of meaning. The stories accompanying the recipes are an international selection of Conroy's experiences related to interesting and useful recipes collected from his cuisine sampling from around the world."
3,Absolutely Right: The Best of Five Man Electrical Band,"I basically bought this CD for the song Signs, but it also has some otherreally good tracks."
4,A great first album...,"Some of highlights on this great early 80s new wave album: Lost Planes, Cameras in Paris, and I Live. The album does sound a tiny bit dated, but for me this is much of the charm - I can smell my high school years when I hear The Fool, and remember my first dates when I hear ""I Found You"". Great stuff. Worth a listen."
4,A reminder of Pro Sports.,I think this is a reminder of how Profesinal Athletes can take a turn for the worst. In the beginning of this Autobiography you can see the reality of the being a pro athlete. You see Lawrence in a situation were he is buying drugs and he is being held up and he is mugged. I thought this is a great way to teach people about how drugs can ruin an image and family life. This book is real it is from the eyes of probably the greatest linebacker of all time.
1,You sent me defective items!!!!!!,"Watch this item! These vision e30s are nice Cookwares.But Amazon has many defective itemssssss!I bought this Casserole and received it today.The handle looks like it was broken?? and brazed again!The color of a Casserole around the handle came off!Inside , apart from the handle has too many scratches and evensome of part came off!This is second time I order a same casserole. First one had a problem too. since I ordered from out of sea(My mom who is in U.S received and sent me here) , I just ordered again instead of returning;sending back to U.S is too expensive.I'm so upset!!!!Secon one has more big problem, can't use it!!!!You don't check before sending??Three oven pans I bought had some scratches, too!!!!!!"
3,not that good.,"i just got this gun yester day, i was shocked at how some people worship this gun. First of all, it does NOT shoot 260 fps. it shoots around 230 on a fully charged battery. Apart from that the hop-up sucks. no matter how long i spent tuneing it, the bb still jumped after about 15 feet. The magizine is another issue. after every 20 or so shots, you have to wind it up again. Another con, is the bbs go so slow, anyone with legs, could side step it. Save your mony. if you want an SMG get a MAC or spend more than $120."
3,husband wanted,"haven't viewed yet, husband orders multiple dvds and hasn't viewed most of them yet, sure the flowers will be beautiful"
4,Good and inexpensive ear protection,"The Dewalt Interceptor Safety earmuffs are a very good, lightweight, and inexpensive set. They are especially well suited for children because they are quite light and comfortable to wear. My daughter uses them when we go see a concert. She is able to hear the music well and still protect her hearing. I can recommend them as a very reasonable set for ear protection."
1,It broke before I got it on my head!,"I got this ear muffs just because I love DeWalt products and try to have the Yellow gadgets around my workshop. When I got this, I wanted to see how much noise can it block. So, I got it out of the package and started to wear it on my ears when I heared ""click"". Yes, the band broke in half. And since I took it with my abroad, I couldn't return it to the seller. The seller, however, was very professional and prompt."
3,Too small,The earmuffs are too small they don't expand enough. I tried it on a few adult make heads and they didn't fit any. Looked like they would be comfortable and easily stored for someone with smaller head.
1,"""Missing the point""...","This CD is actually ""Missing Links"" (not ""Missing Pieces""), with two extra tracks from the original recording of ""Elemental""... It is yet another one of those unnecessary albums that seem to plague the Fixx collection (How many versions of ""Stand or Fall"" or ""Red Skies at Night"" can one have? Five, six? Now I am on my third of ""Two Different Views""...) Ok, there is some really good music on this CD but why not come up with something new instead of rendering the original ""Missing Links"" useless?"
4,Good book for the beginning consultant,"Like a lot of underpaid, underappreciated network admins, I'm looking at going out on my own as a consultant. This is one of the few books available on network or computer consulting, but it's the best one I've read so far. I've bounced the ideas off of relatives and friends that are small business owners, and they generally agree with Matt.My biggest question is: How do you evaluate the competance of subcontractors?When you're just starting out, picking a bad subcontractor can torpedo your business before it gets off the ground. How does he work around that problem?I would also like to see more information on the web hosting/e-commerce field from the small business perspective.Those two questions are the only reasons that I've downgraded this book from five stars. Aside from that, I highly recommend it."
5,rap like it was meant to be----lyrically amazing,"8ball and MJG probably made this for 500$ back in 93, but it is still one of my favorite CDS....despite the lack of truly deep bass, eightball and MJG's amazing lyrical abilities allow for six or seven minute songs which flow and never grow old...my friend from houston turned me on to this CD this summer and everyone i know who has boughten it knows every word on it....highly recommendedParks Brown Austin, Texas"
3,Bootleg CD,Volume was recorded extremely low on the CD. Most Likely a bootleg copy sold as though it was new.
4,A lot to be said for magnetic therapy,I have used other Serenity 2000 magnetic therapy items in the past and decided to get this set. They are a good brand and very helpful.
5,Scourge of Worlds=a world of fun,"I found this video to be an incredibly fun experience. It was great for a party, where everyone voted for what choices to make. It is especially good with 3 or 4 people. This allows each person to play a character in the movies roles, and the choices that only they are there for, only they make. It makes for a short little D&D world, without the trouble of creating a campaign. This is a must have for any D&D fan."
3,Good first shot,"As a lifelong D&D fan and role-player, I knew what I was looking at when I viewed the CD, but I wonder if an inexperienced player would understand the roles of each of the characters in the adventure. I was already familiar with the main characters as they are in the 3rd Edition Players Handbook. I felt that unaware viewers would have trouble picking out the motivations of each of the class-types and races and this would only prove to make the adventure more difficult. All-in-all, I'm happy to see this DVD on the market and hope to see more in the future, but there needs to be more introduction for beginners and more variety for experienced players."
2,Could be much better. Some Wannabe Songs,"With ""Wannabe songs,"" I mean those songs which contain unrealistic theme, such as here ""In Search for God,"" and the songs that entail flat lyrics, tunes, bass like popular eurotrance songs. If I were Transa I would have deleted these songs:5. Chris Cowie House Of God6. Frankie Bones Black & White [Chris Cowie remix]7. DJ 19 Phuturefunk9. Jacob & Mendez Depths Of Time10. DJ Asle Jack You Up [Bladerunnerz remix]-The should-be-deleted tracks will hinder your dancing, do not cohere with the rest, i.e., you will skip these songs.The rest of the songs are very good; very hard-deep-pressing-down beats. If you like the ""very good"" songs played in this CD, don't by this. Buy singles or LPs instead and mix them yourself or let somebody else mix them. Actually I have the ""very good"" songs from this album, and I have selected harder and more deep songs to mix them with. My dj liked it, and so should you. Buy the singles, LPs instead."
5,Big Top Pee Wee!,"Purchased this cd for background music to a set we put together for Halloween. The theme was obviously ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", gave out cotton candy and popcorn, also had funhouse mirrors. All this while Big Top Pee Wee played in the background. It was a huge hit."
1,DVD not received,"This is really great guys youll have aksed me to review this prdouct when i have NOT received this shipment as of date .As per you guys this shipment of Dustys Trail 2 is still pending, in your last mail to me youll said you cannot ship this order and youll will be refunding the money back to me within 10 to 15 working days...RegardsSalome Ferrao"
1,DON'T BOTHER,"Please don't bother with this movie!!! If you want to learn anything with a non-biased view point go read Iris Chang's ""Rape of Nanking"" Most of the Quotes that are used are from that book.This movie paints a picture of the Japanese even now as brainless barbarians, making it seems as if Japan as a whole is not sorry for what happened in Nanking.Don't buy this movie, and if you must see it, it can be streamed for free online."
1,"Watch Your Own Mother Get Raped and Disemboweled, Your Sister & Brother Have Their Limbs Cut Off While Alive and Awake...","Do you enjoy those kinds of situations? If so, watch this film.In my opinion, there are certain things that need not be available for entertainment purposes. This film is a prime example of sensationalism without any redeeming qualities at all.Back in the 1960's there was a film named: ""Mondo Cane."" At that time, the images shown on screen were shocking to me, but now, it could qualify to be shown to kindergarten children if this film (being reviewed) is to be considered as entertainment.How can anyone say they are repulsed by the savage tradegies suffered at the World Trade Center on 9/11 if they seek out the brutality represented in this documentary.For educational purposes? Yeah, right! The School of Terrorism must own multiple copies."
2,Not much usefull for practical purposes,"During the work on my master thesis (""Learning in strategic games"") i bought several books about the topic. This one was the hardest to understand and to apply to anything practical. I guess this one is for ""hard core"" mathematicians."
1,Worked only once,"I tested this charger when I first received it, and it worked. A week later, when I tried to charge my iPod, the charger didn't work at all. Furthermore, the charger I received (from Bargain Cell) had no brand name on it at all, and was shipped in generic packaging. i.e. there was no ""Lux"" brand name, and the no box. I feel that this was a ""bait and switch"" tactic."
1,ripoff,"didnt fit, didnt realize i could not return to macys (even though it came from them), return charges were almost as much as it cost, so now its in the trash... no more ordering from a 2rd party vendor with weird rules.."
2,Disspointing,"I was anxious to read this book after looking at the authors website. From reading the website I found a lot of good questions but I did not find any real answers. I was also put off by her manner of relating to people. She is often abrupt in her responses to questions and instead of answering the questions she urges people to read the book and use her products. In addition she is very critical and demeaning of other authors. It comes accross as if she is better than everyone else and that only she has the true answers. I thought there would be some indept knowledge to be found in the book that maybe she could not summarize on the website. What I found instead was common sense and a pitch for her hair products. I was dissapointed in the information presented as well as the products (which I did purchase as well), neither the book or the products are revolutionary. Save your money."
5,MUST HAVE FOR BLACK WOMEN!!!,All Black Women should read this book. I don't give reviews this is hands down my favorite hair book.
3,Hmmm...good book.,"I salute Cathy because she was the first to really tackle the hair thing with thought and understanding. I thought the book was good except for the typos and the confusing jumble of ideas. A good editor would have truly helped here, but you get the jist of what she was trying to say. If you are looking for specific products or specific techniues then you won't find it here. Some of the thoughts would have done better in other chapters and the repetition of certain ideas (mostly buy, buy, buy my stuff please) is somewhat unnerving. Also, it would be nice to see more pictures of her progress. All in all, it is a nice hair book to have in your collection. Thanks Cathy."
3,Black Hair Care,Pretty informative book as a stylist I don't agree with all of it. But it does give women a good place to begin to care for their hair.
2,Hmmm,Well 6 inches in 1 year aint really nothin special! hair grows 1/2 inch per month ANYWAY (average)..so i'm sure all u gotta do is prevent breakage and keep hair strong n moisturized! thats it! my advice is to sign up to www.longhaircareforum.com!!on her site she answers people very unkindly! DAMN! she would put me off buyin her book talkin to me like that! i'd rather not buy or read her book!
1,Urea,"I looked at the product ingredients in her Conditioner.. one of them is Urea.. not interested in putting ""pee"" on my hair."
5,Common Sense Info,"this book is an absolute must for transitioning, naturals, and chemical treated hair. Its all about common sense when you really think about it. Salons or stylist really become extinct when you have knowledge on your side. Why pay for something you can do yourself and better? TLC is not given when you spend your money, yet you will treat your own hair like a queen that you are..its going back to the basics..simplicity..remove the chemicals, over manipulation of your hair and guess what? You will have a healthy head of hair you were meant to have and born with in the first place!"
1,Save your money,"I didn't find this book very helpful in enhancing my hair growth, although the tips are interesting. I also bought the products that Cathy suggested. They didn't help either. I'm dissapointed in the results - but I'll keep trying."
3,"DO NOT TRIM, UNLESS YOU HAVE SPILT ENDS!","Just keep your hair moisturized (with good conditioners), wash it several times a week, wear it in protective styles, and very rarely trim it. Trimming is not necessary unless you have spilt ends and a lot of hairdressers will trim your hair just for the heck of it. Not good if you are trying to grow it out.The best thing about this book is that it dispells the myth that cutting hair encourages it to grow. Message to all black women: TRIMMING YOUR HAIR IS UNNECESSARY UNLESS YOU HAVE SPILT ENDS! DON'T BELIEVE THE LIES OF THE HAIR INDUSTRY.I have watched my hair grow like wildfire and I don't trim and I don't have spilt ends. This is the best message in the book. Follow my advice and you won't need to buy it (unless you want to support a sista). Also, check out great sites like longhaircareforum.com (dedicated to women of color who want to grow their hair).Good luck everyone!"
3,6' of hair by the end of year,"I am currently 6month post relaxer and am transitioning to natural hair. I purchased this book along with ""Grow It"" and am combining the information in both books to obtained hair growth. So far information in it is the same as Grow it and doing all is says."
4,"Lays the groundwork for ""healthy"" hair","Even though Ms Howse wears a relaxer and portions of the book are geared more towards chemically treated haired women, I think much of the information is still beneficial for naturals. She presents her arguments in a very logical fashion which really spoke to my style of learning."
3,Unsure,I have been natural for two years now. A friend told me about this book. I wanted my hair to be healthy so I need information. This book talks my about the science of growthing the hair. It is a slow read and I have not finish the book but the chapters i have read were helpful. Example she talks about how the best thing you can do for your hair is wear it in a protective style and only straighten your hair one a year as a treat to yourself.
1,"Save Your Money, Buy ""The Science of Black Hair"" Instead","Don't waste your hard earned money on this book! The only reason I purchased this book was because Kimmaytube recommended the book on her Youtube channel. The book was very short. The author even stated herself that this book could be read in just under a day. This book had so many grammatical errors in it to the point that I began to wonder why she published a second edition without doing a spell check. I guess she wanted to market products from her hair care line. People...just by Audrey Sivasothy's book, ""The Science of Black Hair"". I promise that you will find all that you seek and more! The Science of Black HairA Comprehensive Guide to Textured Hair Care"
4,Get this book!!,"Very informative. I learnt thing I never knew, and the information was well put together by the author. This is a no-nonsense approach to caring for your hair."
4,Ultra Black Hair Growth,Great information in this book. Short and too the point. A quick and easy read. Very informative. The author really did her research.
5,"A Moving Meditation on Life, Death, and Resurrection","This reprinted book is a beautiful exposition by Caryll Houselander (1901-1954) on life, death, and resurrection. Scepter Publishing has retained the Scriptural translation of Monsignor Ronald Knox which appeared in the original. Houselander dwells on Christ's life within us, even and especially when he appears to be absent or ""in the tomb."" Someone who has recently experienced the loss of a loved one will probably receive great comfort from this small book. I know that I did. This is a faith-filled work that is down to earth and poetical at the same time by an English Christian who lived through both world wars. Don't skip this book!"
3,Writing could be better,"I picked up this book in preparation for a class trip to Turkey to look at architecture and landscape. I have found it to be exhaustive in details pertaining to archeological discoveries and sequence. I wish that it would leave off some of these details, and spend a little more time painting the bigger picture. The book reads as if you are listening to a one-sided conversation with a very specialized and opinionated professor. It is almost casual in tone, and spends too much time and emotion on issues that don't really aid understanding of the history of Turkey. Having said that, if you can struggle through the dense parts, and keep refering back to the maps, you can get a pretty good idea of the progression and significance of events."
3,it would have been nicer if they had quality review and caught the ten blank pages in the middle of the book.,"It is a shame that no other publisher offers this series in Spanish. I have the whole set now and they all have problems. Pages out of sequence, blank pages. This one had 10 blank pages in the middle of a chapter."
4,Great book!,"This book is great for fans of TV and Movie Cars. They go into everything from the James Bond Aston Martin DB5 to KITT from Knight Rider. If I have one criticism it would be that it doesn't include the famous George Barris cars, such as the 1966 TV Batmobile, Monkee Mobile, Munster cars, etc."
4,Good summary of Law of Carriage of Goods by Sea,One of the better books on this topic. Quite even treatment of all aspects with sufficient depth and breadth. Recommended.
3,CD Order,"It skips a lot.... not too happy for the price I paid. I needed it for a party that I was having, therefore it was too late to return the item... good luck to others."
5,Great,Really removes material in nice manner. One section didn't even need sanding it was so smooth.
2,Just ok...,"The good: My 18 monnth old son plays with this toy for a while, loves the music, and has favorite ""pages"" with each cartridge. Ours does have a volume control, so the ""low"" volume isn't bad at all.The Bad: The microphone stopped working within 3 weeks, the screen is really dark, and the pages get ""stuck"" if the batteries are low.All in all, there are better toys out there...can anyone say My first Leappad?"
2,Not worth the money,"I don't really recommend this toy for 2 reasons. First, too loud,apparently I see from another review that newer models have a volume control--this is a must!!! But, the biggest problem I see is that the screen is difficult to see. It is not backlit and the touch screen is very reflective so it is difficult to make things out, especially when trying to identify colors. The idea is great, but it needs some work. I was really disappointed."
2,Overpriced for a MINI poster!!!,"Why is this poster so much? The bigger, better poster is only $9.99!!!!"
4,Roots,This was bought for the classroom so that the next generation will remember mistakes from the past. It's tough but it's always worthwhile. Acting is mostly over-acting and sometimes comes across as shallow but quality acting wasn't the primary purpose or message of the movie.
4,Nice videos,Videos are good quality overall for the price...great to have for future generatons...great addition for anyones personal library.. you won't regret it
5,great mini series,I love this series. It was so well done. The quality of the dvds are excellent. Well done. I have not viewed the next generation yet.
2,A wonderful saga,"The first DVD I had to return because it was missing episode 2 . Amazon replaced it instantly, thank u Amazon. The second shipment DVD was all mislabeled episode 1 & 2 was episode 3 & 4. But besides that the story is still great. If you are a collector pay for the better DVD."
3,Disc Identification and Soundtrack Problems,Encountered several scenes on the discs where the sound and/or voice track was not synced with the actor/actress speech. The discs were not indentified clearly. I had to start each disc so that I could mark them with a felt pen to put them in their proper order for viewing.
1,The DVD's wont play in my region,When I put the DVD in my DVD-player it would not play at all.When I read the small printing on the Box I discovered this: “Not for sale or rent outside the US or Canada”. Why is it then possible for me to order this item and have it sent to my address in Europe?I will recommend others to reconsider before ordering from amazon.
5,"Simple reading, but the truth usually is.","This short read is characteristic of the author himself: simple, to the point, focused on its theme, and honest. To be perfectly fair, the book is on the dry side, but the truth contained in its pages is hard to ignore. It focuses on the discreet (and not so discreet) ways the adversary of Christianity can damage an individual on a psychological level. Things in a person's past that said adversary may inflict with the goal of preventing a relationship with the Creator. If God uses the simple to confound the wise, then this simple volume could solve a lot of complicated problems."
5,B.B. King 45 rpm recording of Midnight Believer/Take it Home,"The cassette disc recording of B.B. King's Midnight Believer/Take it Home is an excellent buy. It features some of my favorite B.B. King songs: Never Make a Move too Soon, A Story Everybody Knows, Second-Hand Woman and Take it Home, and they are all on one cassette disc. These tunes bring back memories of my courtship with my husband of twenty-nine years during our engagement: a romantic, fun time!"
5,Very endearing book!,"A Girl In A Million is a very good book written by Betty Neels who is my favorite author of Romance books, the story is about an English lady named Caroline Frisby who meets a Dutch guy named Marius Van Hauben and goes with him from England to Holland. I really recommend this endearing book!"
3,"I've heard better, but then again i've heard worse","Well, i have to say the albums alrite, but wut happened no use, i loved the odler stuff(justified black eye, feeding the fire, hazardous to yourself) it was amazing, i wouldnt say this is an emo or pop-punk album, its good, but just not the same, love the video tho, its so true for dumb reminders. Anyways i can see lots of chix liking this and maybe guys who like pop-punk, but personally i miss the old no use. It would still be good to buy tho."
4,Bridal Photography,The book was in great shape and came to my house fast. The reading material was just not what I was expecting the information seemed a little out of date. The seller did their part very well the book just wasn't what I wanted.
2,Very average ideas,We have been in business for over 15 years and are looking for new ideas. This book is the same old stuff. There must be a book out there with fresh new poses? This book is plain boring!
3,Pages stick,"My 2 y/o daughter got this for her birthday in August. The first one worked for maybe two weeks then the pages started sticking & stopping in between pages. So, we took it back & the two extra tapes and got all new ones. They lasted for maybe 2 months and now the pages stick again. Also, she really doesn't like to play with it that much. She just pushes all the buttons but doesn't really listen to it much. I really feel this toy needs a lot of work. The pages are dark & hard to see and they stick. Don't waste your money."
1,Doesn't do much!,This is an overpriced piece of junk! It doesn't teach anything!I bought it for my kids who just turned 1 and 2. My 1 year old danced to the music for about 5 minutes and my 2 year old (who already knows all the colors) just pounded on it with the mic for about a minute or two before he lost interest!. It's going back to the store!
2,Don't know left foot from right,Disappointing! Very boring presentation. Instructors mix up their left from their right so what you see on the DVD isn't what they are saying. Two of the dances -- Fox Trot and Quickstep -- are identical.
3,Sizes run smaller than Carter's brand,"These onesies are very soft, the fabric is thick, and they've held up fairly well with lots of wearing and washing. However, these onesies do run small in the length, at least in comparison to Carter's brand. Size 18 months in Carter's is identical to the length of size 24 month Spa Silk. (Although the Spa Silk onesies are cut with more room in the width, if that matters to you.) It's back to Carter's for us for the next size up, but if we had found the Spa Silk onesies a few sizes ago, we might have been true converts!"
3,Ok but really wide neck,The fabric quality is nice and the body fits my baby well but the necks are super wide and actually come off her shoulders a bit.
2,will not buy again,These are very soft would have loved them however the neck opening is very large and will not stay on I am constantly pulling back around her neck they are also very wide all around... I prefer the Carter's
1,"Nice designs, poor book","While the designs presented are very nice, and the provided information about species used and specifications are useful, the book itself is very poorly laid out, and one can question whether the copy was ever edited. Nearly every page has spelling or grammatical errors or both, and some of the information presented is rendered nearly useless by the awkward wording and mistakes. I realize that Amano is not a mother tongue English speaker, but that's what editors are for."
2,Disappointing,"This video provides a little history, a little overview, and a videoed example of basic techniques. The gist of the video seems to be a demostration of what a front kick is, what a side kick is, etc. Not how to do a front kick, or how to do a side kick, etc. No details of striking surfaces, techniques, or targets are really mentioned. It seems to be more of an overview of ""What is...."" rather than ""How to"". Don't buy it for training. Young kids may get some value out of just knowing what each kick, or punch is called, the history explained, and the mention and explanation of a form."
1,DON'T BOTHER!!!,"I only work a few hours a week, so I figured why spend to much for a pump I would only be using occasionally, BIG MISTAKE!! This pump is the worst item I've ever bought! It did not even work once!!!! There was no suction at all! I returned it and got a pump that actually PUMPED! It is worth it to spend a little more so that you do not have to hand express your milk!! I would give this item a minus stars if I could!"
4,HELL TO ETERNITY,MY WIFE DOES NOT LIKE WAR MOVIES BUT SHE LOVED THIS ONE A VERY MOVING STORY WE BOTH ENJOYED THIS ONE
4,Wrong Actor,What a shame. Jeff Hunter is not Hispanic nor is he 17 in this movie. The real Hero was both. If only they had not been racist at the time this was made! The story is compelling and exciting. The acting besides being miscast is excellent. I would encourage everyone to buy this for their collections and then go out and read the real story of a great American Hero who overcame great odd and did what few could or would have during a time of war or even peace. A tribute to the true American Dream.
5,Quite Spectacular!,"Unspoken Dream caught my attention in the prologue. Being the type of person that just needs to know what happened or how, I was drawn in immediately! Carol's book starts with a tragedy that draws the community together to find out what happened to James. Michael, James best friend, and their close knit of friends attempt to recover from the shock of the tragedy when they are slapped with another doozy. The combination sets Michael out to discover what is really happening.Carol Bennett not only put together an amazing mystery, but captured the lingo between teenagers quite spectacularly. I felt like I was part of the gang. When the book ended it was as if the characters had become my friends and I could not wait to go hang out with the gang again soon. The twists and turns mixed with emotions and life make this book not only a great mystery, but a hit in my opinion. I rate Unspoken Dream ***** Five Stars *****C.J. WilkesDaddy, I Forgive You(...)"
3,disappointing,I was waiting to see this and it left me with a bad taste. The movie does have some good in it but I was expecting more. Some of the scenes were slow paced. A standard film.
2,No spanish audio/subs on HD side,This is just an advise.I bought this movie because according to the specs this have spanish audio and subtitles. This is true only for the Standard Definition side. Why Universal don't did the same for the High Definition version?
1,overload of gore superimposed on ridiculous narrative,"I think it tries to spoof action movies. If you're a fan of improbable comedic story lines and ceaseless gore, this flick may be for you."
2,The first 15 minutes are funny. The rest is more like any other regular action movie.,"The first 15 minutes are funny. It has quite a few tickling dialogues. The rest is more like any other regular action movie. I mean it contains lots of action, explosion and nonsense.It's worth watching once."
4,Hot Fuzz on Clearplay is a favorite here,"We thoroughly enjoy all of the nuttiness in Hot Fuzz, but don't like vulgarity. So we watch it with our Clearplay machine and it's a really funny movie. We also edit out gore, and have never seen the ""R"" rated version, so I can't voice an opinion for the full edition. I can heartily recommend it with Clearplay."
5,Deliciously Hot Fuzz,"I first saw this movie late one night while bored. I hated it. I was also really tired and not paying much attention to it.I caught it again, 2 months later, on HBO or something. It was the only thing on, so I watched it. I just about laughed until I cried throughout the whole movie.Much like Shaun of the Dead, this movie is a pure bred cult classic. With the same perfect balance of humor and gore, they got it right one more time.Officer Angel (aka Officer Angle) and his gang of rural cops go from one suspected murder to the next in sheer and utter blindness about what the truth of the situation is until the very end. It'll have you splitting at the seams from laughter, and on the edge of your seat from the suspense.Enjoy!"
4,Action Addicts Will Love It Even More,"As it came from the brains behind ""Shaun of The Dead,"" I just assumed that I'd have nothing to lose (admit: I haven't seen ""Run, Fat Boy, Run""), but it turned out that this flick was solid in its own right. I'd have given it three stars if I'd never seen any of the action films the characters talk about, but I am a junkie, so the fourth star comes from the parody of/homage to all of those same films. I especially loved it because at about 1 hr 35 mins in there's a huge hate/love conflict re: Michael Bay, who is both the heartbreak of psoriasis/golden child of action movies. On the whole, loved. But quietly. And I think that's how Simon Pegg rolls: quietly, but well."
4,HOT FUZZ,great movie a little slow at first but a great ending. if you like english movies you will love this.
1,bad,i have tried to play this and it wont work...can someone get back to me about this....not a happy customer!!!
1,Talk about bad films,"This film was rated 5.5 stars. I don't know how anyone can find this film hysterical. There were only a few moments where there was any hint that this movie was a comedy. This is one of the dummest movies I have ever watched. I don't think this ""comedy"" even deserves one star, maybe a minus 5 stars."
5,good movie,FunnyLoved itIt was a really good movie. I enjoyed it. i love Simon Pegg and Nick frost.They're so funny.
4,Nice spoof of the Buddy Cop Film,"My only gripe is that it goes on a tad too long; however, the movie is very funny. Some of the gags are subtle. It reminds of a ""Fawlty Towers"" script. Some of the gags don't really come into fruitition until the end of the movie. The good cops were likeable characters and the villians were funny. The plot made no sense really, but it flowed pretty well and the laughs kept on coming so that I didn't care. Timothy Dalton was very good at being obviously evil and smarmy. Edward Woodward was good to see as well. Broadbent and Cranham played off each really well in sort of a Laurel and Hardy team. The actors took the movie fairly seriously so that added to the charm as well.The movie is laugh out loud funny in spots."
4,great fun!,This movie is great fun! A total spoof of every cliche cop movie ever made.Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are wonderful as the law enforcers.Although the box says hilarious I wouldn't go that far.Yes its funny but I didn't find myself slapping my knee.Shaun of the Dead is funnier! That's just my opinion and both films aregreat.Peter Jackson has a flash of a scene and so does Bill Nigty.
3,3 1/2 Stars,"I hate giving this movie such a low rating since I am such a fan of S. of the Dead and of Simon Pegg himself. The worst thing about the movie is that it drags too often. I can stand a few slow spots, but it occurs frequently in the movie. What saves the movie from being a complete bore are the few scenes that are absolutely hilarious! When it's funny, it's really funny. Nick Frost, once again, does a great job at playing the bumbling side kick who has an obsession with Action movies (particularly Point Break). Simon plays his character dead serious, as the character is ment to be played, but it makes the character not interesting. Overall, an average movie. It just leaves me wishing it was better than it was."
4,"Slow burn, but with a great payoff","""Hot Fuzz"" takes a while to really hit its stride, but eventually builds to a wonderful parody of action films -- think the climax of ""Desperado,"" as set in a bucolic English village.Lots of quality extras, as well. The tour documentary is especially worth a look.Recommended for fans of cop movies or British comedy. Heck, it'd even be worth a look for those Agatha Christie fans who enjoy a good action film, just to see the two collide so wonderfully here."
1,Bloody Rubbish!,"My wife would be the first to tell you that it doesn't take much to make me laugh at a movie. Well, now I've found the cure-all. Slap this bugger of a movie into the DVD player, and I'll be yawning not laughing. This movie was a pile of rubbish. No laughs to be found anywhere. Now, I understand that its supposed to be British comedy, but British funny is defined as Monty Python. This couldn't hold a candle to that type of humor. It's a ridiculous bunch of nonsense with a story that goes nowhere very slowly.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!"
5,A Search For The Soul And A Oneness With Others.,"Sometimes as we go through life we think others are totally separated from us but in reading this book I found just maybe there is a universal oneness which is brought through our experiences with nature. This author has a way with thoughts and words which I have never been able to express but surely have felt over and over while I was digging around nature in the backyard of this whole natural,spiritual world."
1,Junk,The cables are junk. I weny through three of them to find one that works and after one day it stopped.
2,Does not provide 2560x1600 resolution,I bought this cable to connect a dell 3008 monitor with my dell 720 XPS with dual geforce 8800 ultra GPUs. It did not provide 2560 x 1600 resolution as stated it could. Best resolution was limited to 1920 x 1080. I spoke to Cables to Go technical service and was told cable should function at the higher resolution but this was not my experience. I switched to another dual link DVI-D cable and it worked fine at the higher resolution. That cable was also a much bulkier and larger diameter cable that came from dell marked as Tai E81280-D 20276. I have returned the Cables to Go cable to Amazon.
1,Cause computer not to recover from sleep,This cable caused my computer not to recover from sleep mode. I went back to the old cables (which used a DVI to VGA adapter) and the issue disappeared.
5,SOLID!,"I was lookin into a double link DVI cable for a quite a while for my Samsung TA29 3d Monitor. 120hz is a lot of difference.. holy cow... and the cable feels very durable and no defects whatsoever. Good price, good product, recommended to anyone who is trying to get that 120hz on their monitor!"
1,Defective merchandise.,Cable would not fit in DVI-D due to defective merchandise. Outside of port was bent beyond repair. Sent in for refund right away. Very disappointed.
1,Doesn't completely connect to Video Card,"I have a standard EVGA GeForce 8800 GTS Superclocked 640MB PCIE video card. It has a STANDARD DVI out. For some reason the 2 screws on the sides that screw into the video card do no reach the nut on the card where they are supposed to screw in. Other cables do just fine, but this cable does not. This is rediculous and very annoying. I would send it back but I'm just going to have to suffer with it because I don't have time for that right now. It was inexpensive but I guess you get what you pay for, so yeah, it's not only inexpensive but it's cheap. Don't companies test their products, things like this just blow my mind and make me sick, whoever gave this product the go to put on the market should be fired on the grounds of being STUPID!"
1,check the bottom line,"this product is *not* sold by Amazon-dot-com but by a subsidiary of an affiliate company. they wanted to charge me $8 ""shipping and handling"" PLUS TAX for a $10 cable. $19 is too much to pay for a $10 cable. i can do much better locally.Tech Depot / Office Depot was good about letting me cancel the order, to their credit. but avoid the hassle, check the bottom line. if the convenience premium is worth it to you, go for it, but be aware..."
5,"Works great, Seems to be high quailty",Other reviewers have a lot more detail. I just wanted to say I received the cable and it works great. Has a nice thick cable and solid connectors with screws. I am using it at 60hz at 1440x900 resolution.
1,Defective and Dead on Arrival cables,"First cable - Only lasted two weeks. During these two weeks, when I moved the cable a bit, the video feed shuts off. Eventually, it just died.Second cable - Sent promptly by Amazon, one-day shipping on them. Dead on arrival. Tested with a friend's DVI cable, worked flawlessly.I noticed that there are several reviews about DOAs lately - must been a bad production batch or something.Got the third cable on the way, hopefully, it will work this time.Edit: The third cable worked. Continue to work even when I move the cables around a bit. I think the third time is a charm :P"
1,Dissapointed,"I have no idea of what happened with these pantyhose, but my impression is that the store had a bunch with some defects and had to take rid of them. Anyway, I bought a dozen or so, and most of them came with holes or runs. It is the first time this happens to me with this brand and specific kind of pantyhose. Too bad.."
1,It freakin burned a Bugera V22,"Don't buy these, I got them and have them installed in a Bugera V22 by a professional, after 30 secs of normal use some resistances started to burn... if it hadn't been for my hommie standing next to the power chord who knows what would've happen...I brought them into Mexico so I can't really do anything from but warn you about this terrible product."
1,Ooooopsie!,DNA evidence actually clearly supports the Algonquin Indians as being of Middle Eastern descent.Too bad these authors either were not aware of that fact or chose to ignore it.Check out Rod Meldrum's research.
4,Good product,"I bought this camera for my girlfriend and so far no complaints. It works well and prints easily. She's not the sharpest tool in the shed, but she works it with ease.The only downfalls, is the limited internal memory, and the ink cartridge it comes with doesn't print many pics. Buy a scandisk and extra ink and it'll be great."
3,Christmas gift,I think I wrote a review on this product before. As far as shipment and delivery goes every thing was fine. As far as the actual product goes it's a Christmas gift so I really can't rate it yet.
4,Overall good affordable camrea,"The Camera is spectacular, great pics easy to use and convienient size. The printer is awsome. Made some good pictures off of it. Down fall is the cost of the replacement ink cartridges and paper. The software for the computer is a pain to use as well. Can not seem to beable to take picture and reduce ""redeye"""
4,WOW! His best work since the early 80's,Fish is at it again. A little more solid. A little less silly. Same old creativity.
3,Pages get stuck!,"I just wanted to leave a critique for those considering buying this toy. I love the idea of it, as well does my 2 year old daughter. As a teacher, I think the cartridges offer a great educational beginning for children. However, I am a little fed up with the toy. It is loud, like other customers have commented, but I can deal with that. The problem is the pages getting stuck. I sent the toy back to the manufacturers the day after she received it for her birthday. I received a new machine which worked for a few weeks. Now we are back to the pages stopping half way through and the songs being way off with the page it lands on. Very disappointed since my daughter loves this toy so much. She gets frustrated that I can't fix it and I in turn get frustrated that it's broken again. If anyone has a suggestion or knows a way to fix it, I'd love to hear it. If it worked properly, this toy would be my absolute favorite."
2,TOO DARK!!!!,"The screen is just too dark....makes you feel like you are going blind when you try to distinguish the colors. I am concerned that the volume may be a little too loud for my daughter's ears. My biggest concern, however, is with the darkness of the screen. What a wonderful toy this would be if we could only see it!!!"
2,Horrible Toy!,I purchased this for my son for Christmas & had to return it. This thing is SO LOUD & there is NO volume control button. Would highly recommend NOT buying this item!
3,"A ""must see"" in person","This toy, as others have described, has a screen that is way too dark. I have seen this in the Fischer Price catalouge, and the screen is shown as much brighter. Check it out in a store before you buy it and see what you think! The Blues Clues color cartrigde makes no sense with this toy - you can't make out the difference between yellow, orange and red."
2,What a disappointment,"We thought this would be a great learning tool for our daughter, plus she loves music. This is very hard to see. The colors are very dull, so it is hard to tell which color it is for a toddler. The songs are cute, but the whole toy needs re-evaluated."
2,My Daughter Loved It But.....,"I gave this toy 5 stars as far as how fun it is and it's educational value, but after about three weeks the toy stopped working properly. The loudness and the dark screen didn't deter my daughter from playing with it when she got it shortly before her 2nd birthday, but after three weeks of what I consider gentle play the pages stuck and would not move. I changed the batteries but that didn't resolve the problem, and she got so frustrated and was begging me to fix it. Well we got a replacement and the same thing happened. I would buy it again because she loves it so much and still uses the microphone and sings the songs, but for long term play don't count on this toy. For those reviews that say the toy was extremely durable I would love to know where you got yours from so that I can purchase one from there and hopefully get better results."
1,We can't get it work out of the box,"We bought this for our 20 month old for Christmas. As a mother of 2, I know how disappointing it is to have a toy that doesn't work on Christmas morning. I always check all the toys as soon as I buy them. The first one that I bought worked in the store, but as soon as I got it home to make sure it was ok it stopped working. I returned that one and picked up the last one in the store. When I got home that one didn't work either. I change the batteries twice and still nothing. I wish I would have read the reviews before having to return this toy twice. I'm very disappointed in Fisher Price for the lack of quality in this toy."
4,I love this toy,"I'm not sure what happened to the person who disliked this toy, but my dad (who never buys toys) bought this toy for my 20 month old daughter and she absolutely loves it. Her vocabulary has increased tremendously, she's putting words and pictures together in her mind, and she is now recognizng alot of the characters more. She especially loves the Oscar song, Big Bird, Cookie Monster and Tully. We just purchased the Blues Clues cassette and she is already in love with it. She uses the microphone and tries to sing along. She knows how to push every button and she is not easy on this toy. The durability has been great. My husband and I know Sesame Street backwards and forwards and I'm actually looking forward to Blues Clues. I am desperately trying to find the Barney cassette after my mom bought the Dora cassette. I totally would recommend this toy to any parent with a child with a curious imagination, a love of pushing buttons, and a love of music!!"
3,Wanted to like it but didn't,"I bought this toy primarily for my 19 month old but also for my 3 1/2 year old to use too! Unfortunately the screen was never as 'bright' as the one pictured on the box or on the commerical. Once you put the cartridge in the picture is darker or more dull than out of the machine. It was hard to see and the reflective light screen behind it made it worse. Both my children loved the songs, etc. though I found it quite loud with no volume control. I called Fisher Price and they assured me that display color was correct but because it was so hard to see the pictures I returned the toy as well as two additional cartridges. If they could improve the brightness and add a volume control it would be a great toy!"
4,Great Toy!...worth the money,"I bought this toy over a year ago for my now 2-1/2 year old daughter and she still plays with it. I now have a 19 month old daughter too, and she loves the toy just as much. The youngest bops to the music, and the oldest sings away in the microphone. I have not yet changed the batteries, the ""pages"" don't stick, the volume is a good volume since it can be adjusted with the ""high/low"" switch on back. I find the toy to be plenty durable since my youngest seems to stand on it quite a bit and has not damaged the screen or any part of it yet. I also plan to buy more cartridges this weekend for them since I just still have the one it came with. I'm hoping the others are just as fun for my kids as the Sesame Street one. I gave the toy only 4 stars because of the colors on the screen...it would be nice if they were a bit brighter and bolder for the kids."
4,Way Better Than The Leapfrog LiL leap,Ok my daughter is 10 months old. We just returned the lil leapster it was wayyy to touchy and it would nt even correspond with the page it was on. This is soo much better. It has different cartriges that all have alot of pages in them. My daughter is still young to really know what she is doing but its soo much better that the leapfrog which said it was for 6 months and up.. Thats ridiculos cuz ME 25 had a hard time pushing buttons and such on that thing! Hope this helps you some. It sayd 18 months and up but u can use it on younger. THey wont rip the pages since its on a screen and its simple buttons too!
2,Collection List,"The titles on this collection are:This Is The ArmySanta Fe TrailStillwell RoadSanta Fe Trail is the only real movie on the disc. This Is The Army is a musical with a very small story to go along with all the musical numbers. Stillwell Road is a documentary in which Reagan is the narrator. As someone who already owns a dozen Ronald Reagan movies (two of which are on this disc), this ""collection"" is quite poor. Santa Fe Trail is a good movie, but I don't know why the other two were picked of all the movies he has been in. I bought this disc because I didn't know what was on it. Still, for the price I really can't complain. You probably pay that much for a good coaster."
3,holy geepers gus,"What is he fussing about. The network adapter is still for sale as an add on for the PS2 game shown here. Another hit by Sony, grab it while the bacon bits sizzle. P.S. Where's my 50 dollar mustard sauce, it arrived on time then left with my potatoe lump sheet."
4,Nice burner,"I have to say that the delivery was quick. This burner was very inexpensive. My wife thinks I paid a lot more for it and that I'm not telling her the truth. My altar is looking great, and the addition of this incense burner it looks better now.I would definitely by again from this company. Thank you."
1,Way too much $$$,"Buy this from the supermarket or drug store for $3-$4, which is way cheaper than $9.49 being charged for this item. I thought there were multiple bags in the pack but its only one bag :("
3,Thomas Hyde,"The package contains 21 pads. Directions state, results within 8 weeks. So you got a package good for 3 weeks and you need 8 weeks. Depending on your scar, cut the pad to fit and save any unused. Directions also state to wear at least 12 hours per day. Try keeping it on for several days. Some results for me on a fresh sugery scar, but not a miracle product."
2,Just couldn't get into it,"This is one of the few books I found I just couldn't finish. The plot did not seem to go anywhere and about half way through I gave up. I had heard that the novel was based off one of the two known female pirates and that is what drew me to it. I was looking for more of a focus on the historical details and events of her life as pirate. Instead, the book focused on her internal conflicts and the juxtaposition between Grania and the queen of England. The book was well written, though, and I would be willing to give the author another try with one of her other historical fiction novels."
4,A Funny classic book,"I think this a really good book. Even though you have to understand what they'retalking about because it was written 31 years beforeI was born.The funniest parsts are when the characters likeHun'Dog,and Mole doesn't always know what is goingon.My favorite is when Churchy butters hisarm and starts eating it and Albert ask"" Why Youis run off the corn an' is eatin' on yo arm."" So Churchy says, "" Why not? I buttered it,Didn't I.""So I recommend this book to any one wholikes a good laugh."
2,I have waited years for this. Finally it's here!!,"The show is great, probably in the top 5 of all time best cop shows. The quality of the picture is great. The only problem I have is that it's not the full season. For the price we paid, it should have been the full season or a couple of bucks more. This entire series, if bought on DVD, will cost more than any other out there. I know many are waiting for the distress sale from Amazon when the price will be cut in half and that's a real shame. It's great to see this quality TV show."
1,Half Season = more $$$$$,"This is a travesty--releasing shows in half season volumes. They're releasing The Untouchables in the same manner!!! Not fair, though it's still better than two episodes at a time like Columbia House did with it's video releases of hour long TV shows."
1,Not for half a season,I have looked forward to a DVD release of The Streets Of San Francisco but I am not going to buy them 1/2 a season at a time. Paramount did the same thing this week with The Untouchables. These programs are not worth $60.00 a season (that's with Amazons' 24% savings)
5,Soft & cheap!,"Love this! I bought it for the price, and expected a cheaper quality of fabric. Blew me away when we received it and felt how soft it is. Easy to clean, hasn't came apart with the threads or anything."
3,Gilligan and the Gang in the Old West,"Essentially a western version of ""Gilligan's Island,"" Dusty's Trail is a TV series about a wagonful of homesteaders lost on the untamed American frontier after being separated from their wagon train. This volume contains the following four episodes:""Androcles and the Bear""Dusty pulls a thorn from an injured bear's paw and gains a grateful friend, just before a different, not-so-friendly bear wreaks havoc at the campsite.""Duel for Daphne""After an innocent kiss from Mrs. Brookhaven, Callahan is challenged to a duel by her jealous husband.""Half Moon""A moon-shaped birthmark on Dusty's derriere leads to his being mistaken for the long-lost son of an Indian chief, sparking a rivalry with one of the tribe's braves.""Witch's Trail""A beautiful blonde accused of witchcraft brings a spell of bad luck to Dusty and his friends."
5,So Underrated!,"I have no idea how it took me so long to find out about this series! You will love this series, the characters are great! I watched the whole season over a short weekend, and instantly found myself dreaming of what it would be like to have so much money that my friends could all just live off of me, and we could just do whatever we wanted all day long. Entourage gives a fantastic view into the life of a celeb, and the losers that grab onto his coattails. That being said, the ""losers"" make the season even better, and the plot lines are much better than you would ever think they can be with such a simple subject.I am so happy that I got this season, and you will enjoy it immensely!"
4,Excellent Series...,"Outstanding television series. Who wouldn't want to be or have a friend be famous and ride their coat tails? I WOULD! Very entertaining writing here. Character ""Turtle"", who hasn't had a friend like Turtle? Purchased the second season as well!"
3,Decent,"I caught a few episodes of this show last year while vacationing in California last year. Thought it looked it interesting and decided to check it out when I returned home. I have to admit the first four episodes did absolutely nothing for me and it took a few days before I popped in the second disc. The second disc to season one redeemed the series for me. Seems the writers finally found their groove. Still, the first season lacks any sort of depth or any real laugh out loud moments. It's just light fluff like watching a group of guys who won the lottery in the land of the rich and beautiful. The only one who comes close to have any sort of depth is Johnny Drama and then Ari a close second. Our leading star, Vince, is as interesting as watching grass grow. Overall: Nothing really to write home about."
3,Portrays Women as Sexual Objects,"This is a fast paced series with an interesting story line. I especially like the agent. He has a lot of chemistry with the other characters and is interesting and different. Some of the other characters, especially the lazy celebrity friends, are lame. I don't even particularly like the main character. To me, the agent makes the series.The thing I greatly dislike about this series is the blatant sex--lots of nude women and sexual situations. I think this film is very demeaning to women and portrays them as sexual objects. The producers put nudity and scantily dressed women in wherever they can to draw in a bigger audience. For this reason, even though my husband and I are hooked on the series, we've decided not to watch more of it."
4,"Good shot , not enough episodes!",I bought this after getting hooked on Season 2. I like the show but what is the deal with 8 Episodes? and then charge alot? I did get off of Amazon for cheaper then most places which was cool. The set is basic and i bought it just to see the first season. I will enjoy watching it over. I like the way the show is done and i love the great cast! Cant wait for season 2 with Mandy Moore being added. Under $30 i would say worth it.
5,Just a Lot of Fun to Get Caught Up In,"It is the realism of this show that makes it so good. With the celebrity cameos and the well-defined charaters, you really feel like you are going along for the ride just like Turtle, E and Drama are. Their dialogue is perfect for a bunch of old friends from Queens, and Jeremy Piven as ""Super Agent"" Ari Gold is both hilarious and disturbing. He and the writers have really created a great character. I wish I could paste some of his more memorable quotes, but most of them would get me pulled from Amazon. Suffice it to say that he is not the most politically correct of people and he has an acid tounge. The phrase ""Let's hug it out, [...]!"" will take on new meaning for you.The show also has some great guest stars, like Val Kilmer as The Sherpa. He's hilarious. You even get to vicariously attend a party thrown by Jessica Alba. This show is just a lot a fun."
4,Mazzy Star,"I've been a fan of this cd for years. Its the kind of music you listen when you're feeling mellow and relaxing with a glass of wine, sitting on the porch and enjoying the view. Its sensual in a soft and lulling way. Good stuff to relax with."
5,THE GREATEST CD I'VE EVER OWNED,"I have owned literally thousands and thousands of cd's. I worked in a record store through college, so bands have passed through my collection like the wind over the years. But this is the CD by which I judge all other albums...that's how good it is. I am a musician and everything that I have ever played or will ever play has its roots in these songs. Hope's voice is the most beautiful I have ever heard in my life. If I had to have one album to listen to for the rest of my life it would be this one. I've had it since 94 and it still gets listened to continuously...and still to this day I hear new things in the guitar work that I haven't heard before. That's because her voice is so mesmerizing that you sometimes forget there's anything else going on. For me, there's So Tonight That I Might See...then there's everything else. There is none higher."
4,Dreamy Sultry Tunes,"Loved the title track ""Fade Into You"" and the acoustic ""Into Dust"" otherwise lukewarm to the more rocking tunes, but still a nice effort by Mazzy Star."
4,"BE-DEVILING, HAUNTING, SYLVAN","Mazzy Star provides the perfect musical potion for a late night seance in the woods. Soothing and psychedelic, jazzy and mystic, Star conjures whatever it is you're seeking."
5,NEW QUEST,"This work of Horsley's launches an entire ""New Quest"" to find not just a historical Jesus, but a contextually historical Jesus, that most seeing, do not see and hearing, do not hear (Matt 13:13). Readers of this volume will seek and find the voice of Jesus within the ""hidden transcript"" that has been veiled, yet preserved throughout the ages within the verses of the Gospels. Horsley's work is intriguing for even the most ""seasoned"" biblical scholar, yet readable for anyone interested in setting aside dogma and cutting through to discover the true meaning of the words and actions of Jesus."
2,doesn't work,"The watch doesn't work, probably just a battery but the instructions say that to replace the watch battery you have to send it to Nike otherwise you void the warranty. Very disappointed because the watch is cute."
5,Excellent,"Finally a black man gets it. I could not stop reading this book. Mr porter backs up his statements with fact. All Black women should consider this book a personal bible. Black women need to understand to overcome sexism and racism we must first love ourselves, fight for ourselves and depend on each other."
2,Very disapointing,"A complete history of the Strategic Air Command is long overdue. As a twelve year veteran of it, four years in the 22nd Bomb Wing (B-47), and eight more in the 55th Strategic Reconnasance Wng (RB-47H),I really looked forward to reading Mr.Lloyd's book. Many good things, but for the most part a major disapointment. Some great photographs and details of the early years in SAC, but despite the errata sheet, typographical errors, mislabed photo's and tales of a B-50 with 1,440,000hp really ruined the book for me. I have Mr. Lloyds book on the B-47 and it is excellant. I know this work covers a very broad subject, but better editing and proof reading would have perhaps helped."
4,A new favorite,"I had not heard of this series before this, but loved the book. The character relationships were a bit confusing, but it was an excellent read. I would have given it 5 stars if this was more clear. I especially enjoyed the narratives about religion, faith, marriage, and love. I plan to read the other books in this series. The ending of the book was satisfying and real. Things happen unexpectidely and I did not feel this was a cop out."
4,review sony cybershot dscp93 5mpdigital camera with optical zoom,very good but rechargabale battery dosnt last long .second drawback is you that picture cannot be enlarged very much. i wish it had a camera cover.
3,I'm glad I won it and didn't buy it,"I won this camera at a workshop I went to. At first, I was in love with it. The size is perfect - it fits into my purse or pocket. It has 5.1 megapixels - which will print beautiful 8x10 pictures. I use this camera to take short videos, and they upload onto the computer and can be sent out in email.Lately, after having the camera for over a year, I've noticed the quality of the pictures going down. I no longer use this camera indoors - I find that it doesn't pick up the light, and leaves the picture with almost a grayish tone to it. I also have a Fuji FinePix camera, and I recently took the same shot with both cameras and I can really see the difference.All in all, this camera does good outdoor pictures, but I am glad I did not buy it because the indoor quality of the pictures is poor. I would look elsewhere for a camera if you are into photography and want the best quality picture."
3,tiredoflooking,I think that this ia an ok camera - If this is your first camera you may not know any better and you will be happy but there are some definite problems!First pros - It does take pictures and they are nice enough. It is Also small and compact which is great for travel. and if you really need a 5 mega pixel this is a great price. Cons- ifyou need a fast shutter speed for small kids that do things in a blink of an eye there are other camera out there that will do the job better. I can take almost 2 pics with my other camera before this one is ready after taking the first picture. I am not real pleased with the picture quality it blurs around the edges I have taken better pics with my other camera. Also probably not real important but I do not like the how images look on the LCD screen it is kind of distracting.
4,Trio without drums,"When I bought this CD I assumed that the trio would be piano, bass and drum set. No, it is piano, bass and electric guitar. I just don't like jazz without a drummer. To me it lacks a good beat. I don't care much for the way the piano and guitar interact both playing in the same high tonal range. It sounds thin to me. Many of the songs are fast but don't make my toes tap. It's like listening to half of a larger group. I'll give Nat credit for being a fine pianist who can really play fast, but this recording just doesn't move me.Update 05/03/2011: It took some extended listening to appreciate what this trio was doing musically. I now like listening to it and have added 2 stars to the rating."
5,Presence of Greatness,"Know how it is when you purchase a CD but whenever you play it you program only a couple of favorite cuts? This is not one of those; every song is wonderfully phrased, cleanly executed. It is a pleasure to spin the whole thing. Other reviewers have commented on their favorites in this Christy collection and I am really surprised that nobody has mentioned ""Intrigue"" - classic Christy voice and a classic Rugolo accompaniment."
1,Positively painful,"This was a horrible movie and after a while, I just couldn't force myself to watch anymore. Unconvincing acting, weak story line and worst of all, unending junior-high humor, prominently featuring bodily functions. Not worth the time or the money to watch."
3,Along Came Polly.,I loved it!!!!CUTE!!! CUTE!!! CUTE!!! LEFT ME WITH A BIG GRIN.VERY GOOD ROMANTIC COMEDY WITH GREAT ACTING AND LEAVES ONE WITH A GOOD FEELING AND A SMILE INSIDE.
3,"Lightweight, but entertaining enough","This one won't solve any world problems, but as a night's entertainment, you could do worse. The chemistry isn't really there between Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, but she's always fun to look at anyway. There are really only a couple of funny scenes: Ben in Jen's bathroom, and the fake French dialect of the St. Bart's beach boy. The rest is fairly routine. No great loss if you miss this, but nothing risked by watching, either."
1,Dont Even Bother...,"Along Came Polly is a complete waste of time. Like Zoolander, the only funny parts were in the trailer for the film. Don't get me wrong, Ben Stiller was really funny in Meet the Parents, but don't even expect 1/92nd of the laughs. Dont rent it, dont buy it, or you'll be just like me, warning everyone else not to make the same mistake. Take your money, and if you havn't bought Return of the King, do yourself a favor and buy that instead."
4,This Movie Is Hilarious,Forget what the people who analyze every movie they watch say and go and see this one.If you liked Theres Something About Mary and all those other politically incorrect movies then you will absolutely love Along Came Polly. Yes it is obvious that Jennifer Anniston's character and Ben Stiller's would end up together but you still wont predict the unbelievable yet side splittingly funny situations they both get themselves into along the way.One of Anniston's best and definitely worth watching.
3,Along Came Polly Review,"Stiller and Aniston's pairing is never believable and their chemistry never comes along to rescue the film from its flimsy foundation. It's not like there's a classic comedy hiding behind these crude attempts at humor, but the elements of 'Along Came Polly' otherwise aren't so noxious. 'Along Came Polly' is a hit-and-miss affair with more flat moments than comic onesous. The result is a disappointment, yet it's not something the actors will want to remove from their resumes. Watching these two go at it is almost as uncomfortable as observing the 60-something Woody Allen nuzzling a beauty less than half his age. I recommend renting this movie first before buying it."
4,Hilarious,"This movie is HILARIOUS. It is Jennifer Aniston's best movie to date. She normally bombs in every movie IMO, but here is the perfect role for her. Ben stiller is SO funny as Ruben. The bathroom scene had me in tears I laughed so hard."
4,Vey Funny,"Along Came Polly shows a very different style of comedy for Ben Stiller. In this movie he is almost to the point of being neurotic. He works for a risk analyst firm. Certain observations, such as bar peanuts, will have you laughing out loud. Jennifer Aniston is also great in this movie, especially with her blind ferret. She is very eccentric, enjoying ethnic food, as well as salsa, or as Ben Stiller calls it Dirty Dancing.The opening scene with the scuba instructor will have you laughing so hard you will find it difficult to hear to movie.Would recommend, very good date movie. It has the comedy as well as though 'aww' moments that all women love.If you do purchase the DVD be sure to see the outtakes of the movie. So of them are funnier then the actual movie."
2,Quite a disppointment,"I love werewolves, and I eagerly bought this book though wanted to return it when I was finished. This book, though beautifully written, has flat, one-dimensional, underdeveloped characters and majorly underdeveloped relationships. Kern and Ainsy barely knew each other and they rushed into sex just like that. Ainsy started out as a strong female character, sometimes snappish but a sweetheart on the inside, and she ends up a helpless damsel in distress when I expected her to tell off the harper and give him a good slap. The plot was thin, with not enough emotion, and the characters simply go with the flow, never developing their own characteristics. But the prose is excellent and breath-taking; I'd like to read other books from this author, though I'll check them out from a library first. The author has a fantastic way with words."
5,DVD Dora,"Dora the Explorer - Shy RainbowGreat DVD, Whom ever has a little child that loves Dora, will love this. Like all of them they have Great music and sing a long. Great color for the little ones even. Great DVD"
4,What's all the fuss about?,"Sure, this isn't the Franklin paper planner or the stand-alone software, but that's not the point. Probably like many who were behind its creation, I wanted something that would let me use the advantages of Franklin Covey without maintaining two seperate address books just for email. Takes a little time to get used to, but this system has worked great for me."
1,"excellent premise, poor execution ...","I downloaded a 30-day ""trial"" version from the FranklinCovey site. The download took 2 hours - I haven't spent that long downloading a single file since I upgraded from dial-up! It took multiple attempts to get the program installed, I received no useful assistance from the company, and still could not get it to work properly. I'm very glad I opted for the trial first, despite the frustration of waiting. Wait for the company to make this more practical and more useful, before purchasing!"
1,Trash,"This machine is a constant frustration. Out of the box, the software is buggy and has never worked right. Tech support is poor, and they are able to do little more than parrot the instructions that come with the machine. Constantly jams when sending faxes, freezes up when sending large faxes, and has never successfully scanned an item. I operate a small business and thought this machine would cover several bases at once, but have been constantly disappointed. HP should be ashamed for putting this garbage on the market."
2,If you have Mac OS X don't buy this!,"Currently (4/12/2004) HP does not support two-sided printing on the 6110 even though the hardware is available for this and it used to work until they updated the OS and the driver. HP tech support is terrible. They are hard to understand and did not know until more than an hour on the phone that the driver wasn't written for double sided printing anymore. Their advice was to wait for the updated driver (still not available though it has been over three months). Most of the features on the panel of the printer will not work in conjunction with the computer, for example the button that would allow you to scan at the printer without going back to your computer each time to tell it to scan to the hard drive. This is a major hassle if you want to scan numerous docs or pictures."
2,Very buggy,"something is always freezing, not working, or conflicting. also, a slow machine. go for something newer."
2,difficult and cumbersome printer,"timely and difficult to setup.automatic document feeder does not catch very well. have to give it a few tries.fax auto answer does not work all the time. many times fax went on when it was a voice call.still haven't got print and scan to work even though usb cable works fine. called hp, said maybe software version (recvd 2.0). they are sending v. 2.02. I have windows xp home version.Overall, would not recommend purchasing this product unless you fully test it and definitely would not recommend buying over the internet as very difficult to unpack and repack.features look nice when reading description but does not work as written."
1,Don't Buy This Machine!,"It's been nothing but trouble. It jams constantly. I have to baby sit each page as it comes out!!! The scanning is bad as someone else describes. It's not very compatiable with MACs. I wanted to like HP products, but this has killed that in me. I will NEVER buy HP again. This is just crazy. I'm goning to have to toss it and buy something else."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"This machine has been trouble from day one! Scanning and faxing are problematic at best, and then the printing often refuses to work after that until some combination of power cycles and computer reboots. I love HP but I hate this POS machine!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I bought this printer for small business use. Within three months I had to exchange it (fo the same model). Now, a month later, I am looking for a replacement and a different brand... save yourself the trouble and look somewhere else."
1,Not White!,"I'm giving this one star because I have, too; otherwise I would give it a zero. Either it's white or it's not. They said it was white and it's not."
1,Rust and Jammed Pump,"We ordered this item and put it into service for our camp (Camp Contact) at Burning Man, and within 5 days the pump had become jammed up. We were able to take the pump apart and put some beeswax lubricant in it to get it work again. Also, the shaft going down into the barrel had rust appear on it after 5 days. The desert is a rough place, but I feel that this pump has poor engineering and materials and that it shouldn't have had so many problems with it so soon. I want to return this item but it got left in our storage facility for the year."
3,Ok book on music,"A friend gave me this book, I think I'd heard of Harcourt, but I'm not sure. Anyways, I pick it up from time to time, and yes, there is some good info in here, however, I have to take issue with the author over his exclusion of the band X in the book! I mean COME ON! With the quality of music that he covers through the book, and he pretty much gets it right, but there is NO WAY that one can cover as much ground as he does and NOT mention the band X, which is one of the greatest bands EVER! cheers."
1,Tastemaker for teenaged white girls.,"This is the DJ who singlehandedly ruined a once great radio show, KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic, formerly hosted by Tom Schnabel and Chris Doritas. Harcourt's Brit-Pop content free taste is unlistenable, especially at 9:00 AM. He's a genius at ferreting out silly, souless crappola. Happy reading."
1,Shill for the labels,"An irritaing morning DJ from a corrupted ""public radio"" station presents his mingy design for living as some sort of guide for the truly clueless.Be forewarned, by the time you've worked these records into your life, he'll have moved onto another trend and will look down his nose at you. You'd do better asking a 16 year-old for musical advice, at least they mix genuine passion with their self-regard and trend-hopping."
2,cyber kid,"My Operating Systems course used this book and we were assigned chapters that did not coincide. Lack of editing, and no source code for process and child process creation, nor thread or how a thread can spawn another thread. This book is incredibly disappointing. This book does not read well at all.I would recommend Operating System Concepts by Abraham Silberschatz (updated for Windows XP)good for a college course."
2,From A Nerd of Nerds,"I am a nerd. As a student at the end of my Junior year, CS Grads wonder how I know more about topics they studied in 400 level courses than they do. The answer is simple; I enjoy learning. I read texts for fun.With that in mind, I think this book may be the worst book on OSs that I have seen. It is incomplete and not enjoyable, even to the most enthusiastic student. I much prefer Tanenbaum's book to this.BYU is dropping this book after using it for one semester of use. I am happy about that, but I only wish I could get a refund. This book is not a keeper."
3,Love the spoon but nylon is peeling,I love all of my Calphalon utensils but most of them are peeling and melted at the ends. I do NOT keep my utensils in the pot while food is cooking but yet the tips of them have nylon peeling away. I thought maybe I had just received a defective spoon but this is happening to all of my calphalon utensils. I have even tried contacting calphalon about this with no response. Through all of the problems though I just deal with it because I still love them and will just pull of the peeling tips.
5,Safe and quiet,When our garbage disposal broke we wanted to replace it with something that had a safety feature since we have 3 little boys in the house. This was a perfect fit and works well. It is so quiet you can hardly tell it is running. Highly recommend.
1,LOVE his other stuff...but this is really lame!!!.,"I love Andrea's other cd's and have his dvd's too! Sorry Andrea this cd stinks. I had to force myself to listen to this even a 2nd time. It is boring, unimaginative and dosen't show case Andrea's voice at all. Andrea what were you and your producers thinking? Just because we love you and your voice dosen't mean we can't recognize a half-baked production when we hear one. What happened?"
1,Major disappointment!,"Andrea, what the heck is this? There isn't a decent song on the entire CD--not one I'd want to hear again. As an avid Bocelli fan, this CD sounds like something he threw together on a busy afternoon. Where's the editing? He screams, rather than sings, as do all of the accompanying singers. Nothing smooth and melodious about this one. This CD will be a major let down to anyone who remembers the soaring of his previous recordings. CAVEAT EMPTOR!"
5,Amore,"Amore is splendid, it shows just how Bocelli can sing with others and yet his voice maintains it's singular strength. in Italian or English the songs are wonderful."
3,Andrea Bocelli-Andrea,The first three tracts are excellent and beautifully sung. Many of the following tracts were not best suited for his voice. I recommend the album if you are a fan but there are better albums for those wanting to get their first album from Andrea.
1,Caveat Emptor,"I bought this item through Amazon in May 2005. I didnt get a chance to use the item till I moved to India in early June. That's when I realised that the product was not working as it was supposed to. Basically, the thing refuses to Auto-OFF, and thus drains the 2-AAA batteries, overnight! Unless, of course, I remove them after listening to songs on my iPod. According to the manual, the product is supposed to Auto-OFF when there is no signal for 30 seconds...Clearly since it was more than 30 days, I could not return the product on Amazon. So I tried writing into Belkin Customer Service to see if anything could be done. I received a prompt response from Belking saying this product is not meant to be used outside of the US (which wasnt mentioned anywhere when I purchased the product). When I requested whether anyone from Tech Support could help me with the problem, I havent heard from them since (over 3 weeks).Has left a bad taste in my mouth:-("
3,FMCalero. (Could be better),"It does what belkin says. but after receiving mine and tried for a couple weeks I found out that the quality of the music is poor most of the time.But even worst these days car radios do not use manual sintonization so is very difficult to find a dead frequencyas happen to my, so I can use it in my Tucson's radio.So I Think they could create a be better product with a stronger signal to play in some poor fm frequency."
2,Did not meet expectations,"The Belkin TuneCast worked okay for the first couple weeks I had it. After a while I couldn't get it to turn on no matter how many new batteries I tried. Even when it did work, the sound quality was not very good. I bought the Griffin iTrip and found it had much better sound quality and was easier to use than the Belkin TuneCast."
1,A very bad product,Analog Solution For a Digital Problem. If I wanted static and poor quality I would listen to Radio. Total Garbage.
3,its ok,"Digital readout never worked right,new out of the box. Contacted seller...got no response. Was cheap enough that ill just keep it and not order from them again."
1,Don't waste your money,"$40, horrible reception and on top of that you have to waste MORE $$ in batteries!Completely unfair. I don't know who had the idea of designing this, but it was a waste of money so I'm looking for a new transmitter"
1,Worst FM Transmitter Ever,"This belkin product produces the worst audio qualityof any FM transmitter I've ever owned. It has constantstatic, hiss and generally a poor sound quality.I've had much better quality from a generictransmitter. AVOID THIS PRODUCT LIKE THE PLAQUE."
2,Glorified Beach Towels,"All this hype about special wicking design... it is just beach towel fabric. Not really refined enough to hang in the home.To make matters worse, one frayed already after only two washes."
1,bugs in the game,"Before you buy this game you better buy a state of the art computer. I have a two year old computer that was state of the art when i bought it. It will not play the game. Not only that, but I tried to contact the web site support for the game to get some help 3 weeks ago and still have not received a reply.As far as I'm concerned, the program is a piece of junk."
1,Garbage,"Same publisher as Fly RC. Everything in and about this rag is horrible. Editorial, pics and the subscription is a nightmare.I highly recommend RC CAR ACTION. Everything in about RC CAR ACTION is superior to all other RC car magazines."
2,"This is ""Britain's best new band""????","Jeez....I sure hope not. Totally unoriginal, right down to their name which they copped from Tim Buckley. Their attitude seems to be ""gee, who should we try to sound like on THIS song?""Save your money for something with a bit of originality and SUBSTANCE."
1,Horrible,"Boring Boring BORING!! Unless you like that watered-down over-done mellow britpop a la Coldplay (which are far more emotionally satisfying), Travis (which are phenominal songwriters), or Radiohead (there is no comparison to one of the greatest bands of all time). Those are good bands, but imagine a band trying to sound like them, but without good songs and totally dull and lifeless. Then you get Starsailor. Be happy."
4,Another New Great Entry From Brit-Rock,"Starsailor has created quite a stir in England, where the group is hailed as the next (take your pick) Radiohead/Coldplay/Travis. Let me tell they are not good as any of them, but they are still quite good!""Love Is Here"" is an engaging album, lead by 21 year old James Walsh telling us stories of his young life so far. The album boasts 4 singles so far: ""Lullaby"", ""Alcoholic"" (with haunting lyrics like ""Dont you know you have your daddy's eyes/Your daddy was an alcoholic""), ""Fever"" and of course ""Good Souls"", the song that has captured the (limited) attention of US radio. They are quite good, no question. Check out also the beautiful title track (""Cant you feel it? Love is here!"").The comparisons to other groups such as Coldplay are quite unfair, and I hope StarSailor will given a chance to find their own place. Meanwhile, check out this engaging debut album!"
2,Ugh. Derivative and repetitive.,"How many times can you repeat the same words in the chorus of a tune? I loved the melody of ""Good Souls"" when I first saw the video. But 5 minutes of the same line drove me insane. The rest of the songs weren't enough to keep me listening. Too bad, I was optimistic... but if you want my copy, you can have it."
3,All is not right!,"Man,I found this CD hard to listen to, the vocals are very much in the style of ""Broadway meets Sitcom"" it's simply painful. It's like Liza Minelli doing Radio Head covers. I see references by other reviewers as ""Creative and Original"" but I hear nothing original here, I repeat, nothing original. I wanted to like this CD but come away actually angry. This is the bottom of the barrel as far as I'm concerned."
5,Essential 4-harness Pattern Book,"This book is to weavers what Vouge's Knitting Ultmate is to knitters: the essential companion to any 4-harness weaver, whether they are a beginner or a pro. This complies everything you need to know about tabbys, overshots, twill structures and more and it is comprehensive and easy-to-read for those who understand weaving instructions. I have several weaving books in my collections but this is always the one I refer to for a new pattern when I am ready to re-warp my loom. Unfortunately the archaic binding and old-fashioned print could use a revision but if you don't mind the black-and-white photos this Pattern Book is a gem. A must-have for a weaver who is going to spend quality time with their 4-harness loom."
2,Long time fan disappointed in short order.,"I saw him as far back as '80 with the Jam and again solo in '90. I'm afraid this is no landmark album. A true test of a live album is whether it stands up as an introduction to an artist rather than providing fans with striped down versions of songs they already love. The thing that strikes me is how unremarkable the performances are. They feel run of the mill. No 'magic'. I wouldn't be surprised that if Paul played incognito in a pub, most people would just talk over him - so ordinary are his renditions. Average busker quality strumming, and a voice that while brilliant on album is very par here, this album amounts to an obvious purchase for a completist fan but it's rather forgettable if you don't know him. While he may [be great]as a rock guitarist he completely lacks acoustic fidelity on this solo effort. Sorry Paul but despite being a huge fan, I'd have to say this is not worth the [money]."
3,"UHF only, fragile","When it works, this is a fine antenna for HD reception, as long as the station uses the UHF channels for HD broadcasting. The inner solder points are weak, as mentioned in another review, and broke after the antenna fell three feet to the floor.I replaced this unit with the Terk HDTVi, also sold here. The Terk unit looks similar, but has a set of built-in VHF dipole ""rabbit ears"" which allow reception of all local channels 2-13 as well as 14-69. For about two dollars more, it's kind of pointless to go with a UHF-only antenna like the Philips or Zenith versions when you can get similar UHF reception with the Terk and VHF as well over the same connection.The Philips isn't a bad antenna, it works fine, but I recommend the Terk instead."
1,Couldn't get into this one,"This one started out OK, but I gave up after about 70 pages. I had a hard time following this book because there was just so much going on that had little or nothing to do with the main storyline. I became bored with this story and gave up. I may try to read this author again if I can find her books at a used bookstore."
5,A good album to get for this group.,"I don't have the Captain Oi version of this album but I can say like Punk's Not dead, this is another album that you might end up listening for a year or more. it's also that good. enough said."
3,Belle Case-Motorola Cell Phone,"I love this case when it arrived, right now I can see that it do not have a perfect fit and it do not protect my phone when it falls. But if you want it for the beauty buy it !Lux Motorola Razr V3 V3C Metal Shield Cell Phone Case, Silver"
3,Cheap and nasty version of brilliant and wise insight,"This version of the book is extremely badly presented and disappointing. I originally borrowed a hardback and larger format copy of this book from my local library several years ago. It was so wise and with apt and good quality photographs that I have been looking for it since. I was really pleased to find it on Amazon - but this version as advertised is a very very mean copy of a brilliant book. The photographs are shoved at the end of the book in one hit and the text looks like somebody's typed it from an old manual typewriter. I recommend searching for the larger hardback version. In my opinion, the cheap and nasty paperback version should never have got to press."
4,"Fun, quick read, but not close to his best....","KEN FOLLETT IS WITHOUT A DOUBT ONE OF THE BEST AUTHORS AROUND. BOOKS LIKE ""THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH, EYE OR THE NEEDLE, ETC..."" ARE CLASSIC, BUT HIS RECENT STUFF, THE LAST 3 BOOKS ARE CERTAINLY MORE HOLLYWOODISH. THE PLOTS ARE LIGHTER, BUT THE BOOKS ARE FUN AND ENJOYABLE. IT ALMOST SEEMS THAT FOLLETT HAS TOTALLY CHANGED HIS WRITING STYLE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. ALL IN ALL, I ALWAYS ENJOY HIS BOOKS, MAINLY BECAUSE I LOVE THE WAY HE WRITES. THE THIRD TWIN, WAS SOMEWHAT PREDICTABLE, FAST MOVING, AND A GOOD READ"
3,Good Easy Read - Not His Best Book,"He's written some great books and I've read many, but I thought this was a little pat. The characters were predictable - the strong female, younger sexy man, devious vain older man with a right wing world view, lots of feminist terminology. In other words, the characters were not that developed or interesting. But, the story line was very interesting and there were lots of twists and turns in the thriller to engage the reader and encourage them to finish the book. I took it to the beach, enjoyed some reading before bedtime and would say if you want a book to take on a vacation or pick up at your leisure, you should enjoy it."
2,"Get back to writing good novels, Follett!","The premise of this book about cloning held such promise. It just didn't deliver. And, it was factually inaccurate as it concerned the internet. It is mildly amusing, but most readers will figure it out in the first few chapters. Read Pillars of the Earth or A Place Called Freedom instead"
5,YOU LOOK FIMILIAR - HEY YOUR ME!!!!,Dolly the Sheep take a back seat. Talk about a novel thathas the theme of the day. A very entertaining story that takesmistaken identity to the limit. Mr. F doesn't disappoint onthis one. Read it then keep a sharp eye out for someone wholooks like you. You never can tell these days.
4,Ken Follett writes another-I can't put it down thriller,"In ""The Third Twin"" Ken Follett makes you wonder, and worry, at the abilities of modern science. The book leads you into the hallowed halls of research academia and the deceptions that go on within, as well as the scarey potential of modern genetics. Not only will it keep you turning the pages wanting more, but it asks the questions of how far can we trust scientists and the corporations that fund research"
2,Disappointing,"I've read a lot of books, good and bad, and this is one of them. Mr. Follett should take his money and run. Because I hate to leave a book unfinished once started, I won't burden myself with starting any new efforts by him"
3,It Was Good to Read on the Plane,"This was not one of Follett's best books. But still, I'm glad I had it on my last trip. It moved pretty fast, like all his books and it was sure better than the movie and made the time pass more quickly."
3,Uneven,"I thought the idea of genetic experimentation on humans by corporations and/or government made a great central idea for a thriller. I also liked the idea of a strong female protagonist who stumbles upon the experimentaion and deals with the greedy, arrogant businessmen who want to cover it all up at all cost. I also liked having an evil clone as a secondary antagonist. But the characters weren't particularly well rounded, and instead on focusing on the central idea - genetic experimentation on humans by unethical and immoral people or even the monster clone and his miserable evil ways, the story veered off into an unlikely and very weak romance between one of the good clones and the protagonist. The scenes where the bad clone(s) act bad are the best and most exciting parts."
2,Leaves much to be desired.,"The story of Gilgamesh would not be an epic if it hadn't represented the human ideals of dedication and wisdom. Gilgamesh goes on an extensive journey, obsessed with the death of Enkidu and the idea of eternal life, only to fall asleep at Utnapishtim's home and be turned away. When he finds the secret, he carelessly loses it. All the time he is overcome with an unrealistic grief over Enkidu's death. Peculiar comparisons, and something that is just too close to the Judeo-Christian tale of Noah's ark. Make better use of your time and read the Iliad."
5,Good product that doesn't irrate your skin,"I've been using this Aveeno cleanser for a year and it's really good. It goes on smooth, it sort of feels like silk and it doesn't leave my skin dry. On top of that, it smells great. I would recommend this product to my friends."
3,Parental Guidance necessary for younger viewers,I enjoy the idea of this series but it is too melodramatic with too much dating. They try to deal with political issues and child rearing but Little House on the Prairie and The Walton's is far superior.
2,Too Worldy,"I enjoy the show but, you cannot tell by looking at them that they are supposed to be christians, they look just like the world, and act just like the world, other than that it still beats the junk that is on TV today."
5,Those wacky Camdens are at it again!,"The twins turn a year old! Yeah,thats one of the many events of this season. We witness the beginning of Erics heart problems,the beginning of Marys life problems,and Lucys' steps towards her future. If you haven't seen them before,now would be the time to catch them. If you have,its a chance to look back on how different things were."
4,7th Heaven Review,This televsion series has always been one of my favorite shows to watch. It teaches you many things about life changes and how to handle them. I would recommend this t.v. series to anyone.
4,where is 007?,"I have the cassette version of this album and it has the great 007 Theme from ""From Russia With Love"" and used in several movies thereafter, especially ""You Only Live Twice"". For some reason it's not listed on the CD version. What gives? Too bad that omission prevents this album from being the best 007 album out there."
4,Good Chinese Cuisine,"I've had this book for 20 yrs and still haven't gotten through all the recipes, actually maybe only 1/4. I find that the recipes I try are very good, but some are very time consuming so be prepared to work for the recipes. You will be rewarded for your hard work. I would recommend that you should have some basic experience in cooking oriental cuisine before you use this book. I would rate this book to be for intermediate cooks. All in all I recommend this book."
3,"Flawed, But Worth a Read","John Keel is an entertaining, controversial figure in the Fortean world. This book covers a lot of ground trying to makes the case for his Grand Unified Theory of paranormal phenomena. Unfortunately, his rhetorical tricks and baseless assertions get in the way of his legitimate threads of argument, but the careful and interested reader will find it worthwhile."
1,They piled after 1 washing,"I am very dissatisfied with these sheets, becuase they pilled after washing them once. When you lie on them you can feel small little balls that have come up on the bottom sheet. I've had sheets for years that do NOT do this, so either I got a defective pair of sheets or the fabric and quality of these sheets is very poor. I would not buy these sheets again for any amount."
3,Not as described or pictured,"The label says RainBow 100% Egyptian Cotton. No labeling as Elegance or 600-thread-count or sateen. It doesn't feel like 600-thread-count and does not have even the slightest sheen or silk-like feel. The sheets are nice and thick and somewhat soft. The color is almost peachy. They resemble another product's customer comment regarding a 500-thread-count Ecru sheet. This really makes me wonder if they are selling RainBow 100% Egyptian Cotton peach sheets as much higher thread-count, more popular colored sets. The advantage: they do seem very sturdy and I'll bet they last a long time."
1,Design Flaw,"Delivery time was long - at least a two-week calendar period. When the charger arrived, it LOOKED just like my original charger. However, on the underside of the plug-in to my cell phone, the unit had two small RAISED ridges (on my original plug-in had two small 'valleyed' ruts....not RAISED) Obviously, the plug-in did NOT go into my cell phone receptacle. I needed a different design for this plug-in to work. Still waiting for response from the OEM shop (through AMAZON). VERY FRUSTRATING!!"
1,didn't work for us--but our bed was not platform,"We have a framed bed for our son where the mattress sits inside a wooden frame. I thought this guard would work, but it doesn't fit. we had to stick with the universal guardrail from pottery barn kids which just slides in."
3,Safer is not necessarily simplier!,"I am not sure whatever happened to the bedrails I used for my son. Put together, extend arms, put under mattress, kid stayed in bed. In an effort to make either better or safer they have only created headaches and problems.Putting together was simple, however, securing under a mattress was horrible. I had to secure this under a queen mattress for my granddaughter to sleep over. Very difficult could not do alone and then it wasn't any better than the bedrails I used for my son.They should simply have kept the arms longer and forget the securing under the mattress on the other side of the bed."
2,Design flaw,"I have had this bedrail for exactly six months, and it broke at the plastic join between the rail and the support that goes under the bed. I have had two other bedrails for several years (the Munchkin Safety Deluxe Bed Rail and Summer Infant Sure and Secure Single Bedrail) -took a look at both of them and the joins are metal, not plastic.As well, the Dex does not have straps that securely grasp the far side of the bed, next to the wall. Both the Munchkin & Summer Infant do, and are much more secure fits. I use them both on platform beds, so am disappointed that the Dex does not work properly. I am also disappointed in Dex customer service, who told me on the phone that they received my warranty request and photos of the broken bedrail via email and would be back to me; one week later, no response."
2,Dissapointed,"I was dissapointed when I got the bed rail only because it doesn't go all the way down and it is kind of dangerous to have it in a down position, I still use it but it is up all the time and it is on the way to make the bed, I would NOT recomended."
2,Regalo Hide-Away Bed Rail Model 4020HD,"This product is very simple, solid and functional but the manufacturing quality does not meet customer's satisfaction.1. The anchor strip should slide into guide tube without binding. When the guide tube was welded they left extra welding material in the slot so that the anchor strip can't be assembled. Ordinary people could not assemble the parts for the discrepancy. I had proper grinding tool to remove the extra flesh and could assemble parts.2. The markings on the parts were incorrect and caused confusion.3. When I unpacked the package, I found two pieces of one item instead of paired parts. The sender replaced the missing part within a week."
2,"Does the job, but a few flaws","Certainly does the job, however a pain to install if you have a box spring and it's not easy to fold down. Once it's folded down it does not lay flat."
5,Le Origini Di V.1 & V.2,This is the one to buy and has the best songs! Le Origini Di V.1 & V.2 (approximately 39 songs total)
2,lesser quality than matching sink faucets,"I like the rain shower head but I am disappointed in the quality of this shower faucet trim. I expected a match with my Devonshire sink faucets: the style is similar but the face plate and some other parts feel more like tin, get water spotted and are impossible to clean. I would not recommend."
3,Forester writes soap operas too,"The book started out good. Then, it went into a tailspin when Barbara arrived with them royal folk and messed things up. The book rapidly devolved into a soap opera with tales of romance gone bad. When HH cheated on the first wife, no one cared. He never should have married. When HH cheats on Barbara, with a former love, Forester becomes the writer of a soap opera. Barbara is off partying while HH is at home bored until he gets an urge for Marie. Marie pays the price when HH gets bored in France and decides he needs to sneak out of France before Bonie has his way with HH. Bush gets killed. Bad thing. Brown gets married. Good thing. Marie dies. Bad thing. HH just goes on never happy with what he has and always grasping for something new while sweating about keeping hold on the old. Had I read this book first, I never would have read another HH book. I hope the final one improves for Lord Hornblower."
5,Great For Grandparents too!!!,"My daughter purchased and completed the fill in the blank pages and folders for all the information for her children and pets. It was so wonderful for me to have while recently babysitting for the kids. I had all the important information right at hand and it was so well organized. The book is such a wonderful, needed organizer and I would recommend it to any family with children."
2,small,"a guy begins to shrink (wll, there is a story behind it, but that's what he does). and......he continues to do so. in the end he must face a spider which think he's yummy. one little fight for one little man. the book is just as good as it sounds. things that happen in this book has at tendency to be dull."
4,JJ Tubes have become a standard,"The quality is consistant, noise is low, gain is moderately high and they work well in combo amps. Never had a problem with the 20 or so 12ax7s I bought over the last few years for 5 different amps."
3,Buy it for Yul!,"We're so used to what can be done in movies that this one doesn't have enough bells and whistles to be a good spy thriller. Even so, if you are a Yul Brynner fan, you will want to have it. I won't tell the story, but the blurb on the cover isn't accurate. Suspend disbelief and go for it."
4,Good product,"The product seems to be working, my dog's teeth appear cleaner and gums are less red. I have several friends using this and all of us compare notes as to results, overall we all have had positive experiences."
1,Not effective.,"I was hesitant to buy a product like this, but after reading several positive reviews, I decided to give it a try. After two months of usage, I have not noticed any reduction in the plaque levels of my dog's teeth. (See the image I uploaded at the top of this page.) Each day, I add two scoops of the PlaqueOff product to her food. In addition, her teeth are brushed three times per week.Save your money and take your dog to the vet to have his/her teeth professionally cleaned. Then be sure to brush frequently to keep the plaque at bay."
4,update: used for senior Yorkie,"Vet visit last week: some plaque build-up on her teeth. Dental not due until next February-March. We'll see how that goes. Product is easy to use and has lessened ""doggie breath"". This was a re-order; began product use earlier."
5,Formthose who don't or can't brush!,"This product we have used for 4 years. Our vet said our dogs teeth are great and to keep doing what we are doing. We don' brush, we use plaque off and his teeth have little or no plaque buildup"
1,I had high hopes,"Unfortunately, this stuff is snake oil. Went through the entire jar for my two dogs, one 13 year old, the other is 3, and religiously followed the directions on the jar. With some of the other reviews I figured it might work, since I can't put my 13 year old under for a tooth cleaning it was worth a shot. I'll tell you now, it does exactly nothing. Might be good for getting a bit of greens and minerals in their diet but that's about the extent of it."
4,"SCOTT, WE'RE YOUR FATHER","When Scott (Charlie Hofheimer) goes missing, his mother (Nastassja Kinski) informs two of her former lovers that he could be their son. Jack (Billy Crystal) is a lawyer and is skeptical but when his business takes him to San Francisco, he looks for Scott, only to run into the extremely neurotic Dale (Robin Williams) who believes Scott is also his son.Robin's neurotic character allows him to go through his various character routine which made him a star in the 80's. Together with Crystal they make for a pretty good film comedy duo. The plot was fairly stale and only the strength of Williams and Crystal pulled this thing through. 3 1/2 stars.PARENTAL GUIDE: No f-bomb, sex, or nudity. Some minor sex talk. A soft PG-13 rating."
3,"A bore, but Robin and Billy kept it going","This movie, unfortunately, was a bore. Only Robin Williams and Billy Crystal kept the movie going. This is a story where a woman get two men to help her find her son..who ran away. The mother tells them Robin and Billy, at different times, that they are the father of this runaway teen and he needs to be found. Robin and Billy go on this wild goose chase for this runaway teen. When this teen is brought back to his mother, they find out that neither of them is the boy's father. Disappointing."
4,A Job Well Done,"I must admit, upon first glance, I was a skeptic. I was almost sure this would be a run of the mill, regular old gangsta book. I was ready to roll my eyes and write this brotha off as ""just another hood writer."" I am so glad I was proven wrong. Kaven has taken a well crafted story and made it into a fast moving, action packed thriller. I was blown away, very impressed to say the least. There are very few authors out there that can break out of the urban lit genre and do something new, and Kaven has proven that he is not one of them. Keep pen to paper, as I am ready and waiting for part two."
5,great little camera,"I first bought the casio Exlim did'nt like the dock system!So I bought the optio 4.The Quality of the Casio is much better! Made in Japan vs Philippines (BUT) the camera is still very good!You can order the Casio Exilm wallet type case and it works fine! You can find at a lower price at other dealers..OH yes!It has software included but,I found Kodak easyware MUCH more simple and looks great when you use full screen.You can download from Kodak websight.."
5,Primary for Church's leaderships and those preparing for church's leadership.,This Book is written primary for Church's leaderships and those preparing for church's leadership. It is a profound study! While it explains the spiritual nature of the church in the present (in relationship to the Kingdom of God); it deepen one understanding of the physical church seen and it operations on the earthly and human level. It is a book to be appreciated for the time and effort placed in the development of such a text. It is believed to a needed text for present day church's ministries. Prehaps one will find himself or herself greatly enriched in Christian ministry through a study of the book. We strongly recommend it for one who is interested in a New Testament study of the New Testament Church on the Apostle's Order and pattern in the 21st Century.
5,Awesome Sampler,"This CD is an awesome set that gives you a great sample of current techno/dance songs out in the UK. Having spent the last 3 months over here, I can attest to the fact that most reputable dance clubs play the music found in this 3 CD set. Awesome songs attached to awesome memories for me, this is definately not something you want to pass up. A great sample of all the great artists unfortunately not breaking through in America. Pick it up, its great."
2,"Nice, but impractical","In our opinion, the highest setting is much too low for a newborn up to 5-6 month infant. The crib is very nice, pretty solid, and not too hard to put together, but it is extremely difficult to pick up/put down my baby, especially without waking her up. I am 5'3"", so perhaps it wouldn't be as difficult as someone who is 5'8"", but since the other reviewer hasn't tried with a baby I would seriously consider this issue prior to purchasing. I wish we had read the reviews and looked into that more--we fell mostly for the look and convertibility. I would not have bought it had I known. We purchased it recently and my baby is five months old...cannot imagine how challenging it would have been with a newborn. I am looking into a return...if not, we'll have to purchase a step stool for sure, which seems unnecessary considering the purchase price. Wish the salesperson we worked with had advised us of the setup."
2,not practical,"If you are looking for your own desires....looks..... a nice set to look good in your home, it looks nice... but as far as actually using it.... The sides are too high, they dont lower to get the baby out, the bumper doesnt attach in the back.... My baby is now 9 months and it is already chipping on the sides.... I planned on this being the crib I pass down from one kid to the next, but i dont think that will be the case... And the whole mobile thing.... it is nothing that helps to caring for your new baby but add stress.... I am going to sell mine and look into a new one.... I really dont recommend it at all.Well please take this all into consideration before buying this crib."
2,Not quite....,"I heard the buzz about Kasey Chambers and liking Country/alt.country, I couldn't wait to hear it. I'm sorry to say that, with the exception of two...maybe three songs, it sounded very forced.She probably does have potential as a cross-over artist, though, due to her voice."
4,What a voice!!!,"It pains me when artists lead off albums with the worst tracks. I almost stopped listening to this disc after the title track, Barricades & Brick Walls. It was almost grating. I'm glad I soldiered on. What I found was a voice that amazed me, and simple songs that were crafted brilliantly. At times you'll here the ghost voice of Lucinda Williams. Other times, it'll be Jewel. But the words are almost all Kasey (with the prime exception being an enjoyable cover of Gram Parsons' Still Feeling Blue). Not Pretty Enough walks us through thoughts of futility most anyone is familiar enough. And while the album doesn't quite reach this level again, other highlights include Nullarbor Song, about Ms. Chambers unique upbringing in Australia, and also This Mountain. And it only gets better with repeated listens (after I skip over the first song!)"
5,"All I can say is, ""David Bowie and the Muppets""!","What else could you ask for: fantasy, muppets, and David Bowie 1986 version re-released!An answer to this anachronistic girl's dreams!"
5,this is the best movie i have ever seen,labyrinth has been my favorite since i was 6. when i come to find out alll video stores have stoped renting it i went looking but nothing is out there. i say RERELEASE! IT'S SO COOL!
4,Great movie,"The movie is a classic, very fun. One of Jim Hensons best. Great effects and David Bowie does a good performance. Micheal Motion does a great job juggling, from behind David."
5,A Classic!!,I could watch this one over and over again! Its a really neat well presented family movie. David Bowie is wonderful at playing the role of the Goblin King. This is must see movie for those who like something out of the ordinary
5,Great product,My sister loves this movie so I was so happy to be able to find it for her for her b-day. It was in great condition and the special features were a added bonus!
4,David Bowie scares me,"Okay, people have been telling me to watch this for years. I must say, it is worth watching. It's a well done fantasy, as only Jim Henson can do it. It reminds me a lot of the Alice books. The music really lends to the atmosphere, although I can't quite make sense of how some of the songs fit into the story line (e.g. the song in the Escher setting). David Bowie is really freaky, especially with his tight pants and wacky hair. It's a very eighties movie."
5,Triple Threat,David Bowie...Jim Henson...George LucasIf that's not convincing enough then I don't know what it.
3,This is an odd movie.,It was really strange but has some good acters and good people. I really liked the worm.
2,Another thing wrong with the 80s,"This movie was sooo lame. The songs hurt my ears and David Bowie's pants hurt my eyes. Jeeze man his dingle was dragging on the ground. Dumb songs, David's tight pants, what could possibly make the movie any more campy? Oh wait there were MUPPETS TOO! This was a stupid, lame and all around retarded movie. I gave it another star because David Bowie had the courage to use a deranged hairstylist kicked out of Cats and wair the leatards that showed all of the bulges."
4,.,"A silly but thoroughly enjoyable kid's movie, with lots of fun Henson creations. Displays a level of imagination equal to films like The Dark Crystal and Return to Oz, though it is not quite as thoroughly haunting as either of those movies. Still, it can't be denied that Labyrinth has a powerful atmosphere and a true sense of wonder, even during the David Bowie musical interludes. A fun little gem."
2,not big on mixing musical with fantasy,"I never saw this movie until i was 16. The girl i was dating at the time loved this movie. The rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way. But they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies. I did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments, well so did fraggle rock! fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason! everyone burn your copies now!"
2,I don't understand why everyone likes it so much,"I think that The Labyrinth is completely overrated. No offense if you like it, but I just don't see what's good about it. In fact, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw it with my friend and we basiclly just spent the whole movie making fun of it. The only reason why I gave it two stars is because it was creative."
5,Blu-ray really makes this Movie come Alive!,"When watching the Special Features after, you get to see how Big an Improvement the PQ with the Blu-Ray Treatment gives.Didn't really notice the Audio since I was too involved in the Visual Aspect. Did notice some parts where it was hard to understand what was being said. But very little of this.Overall recommend purchasing as this is one of those timeless stories that Blu-ray has further enhanced.Can't go to the movie at the current price. Of course, after 26 years, I doubt you'd find it there anyways. Surprised to see Cheryl McFadden was the Choreographer. (Red Haired Doctor on Star Trek the Next Generation.)"
3,The Humans Got In The Way,"Even though I like David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly, I think the movie would have been better if their characters had been puppets, also. The puppets themselves are pure Henson and, as such, amazing. Felt that the storyline could have used a bit more spice to it as it tended to drag in places. A good movie to check out the puppets, but The Dark Crystal would be a better choice."
5,Love it!,I love this movie...I used to watch it all the time as a kid on the VHS version. I was so happy that Amazon.com had the DVD version! :-)
3,Love this kids movie,"As an adult I love this kids movie. I enjoy watching my children watch it and sing along and dance. It is an old movie so it does not have some of the digital camera action shots like the newer movies but, once you watch it you'll come to love it just the way it is."
5,Excellent,"Labyrinth is my favorite since I was 7, now I'm 20 and it's still my favorite. I can't belive I can't own it. IT'S A SIN. RERELEASE!! I BEG YOU TO HELP US RERELEASE!!!! SONIA"
4,"Fantastic fun, but those songs!","I was sixteen when this film was released and was, as all sixteen year olds are, suitably cynical about it. On my first viewing, I was pleasantly surprised at the atmosphere and humour of the film and lets face it, the creatures are cute. My one criticism would be that the songs are terribly 80's and weak 80's at that. Still, on subsequent viewings there is still much to enjoy. A PAL video re-release would be most welcome, if only because this is my girlfriend Rima's favourite film of all time."
5,Unbeatable combination of talent...,"This movie was incredible. One of my all-time favorites. The combination of talents that brought this movie to the silver screen was absolutely amazing and in my humble opinion, unmatched to this date. George Lucas, Jim & Brian Henson, Brian Froud, David Bowie, and Terry Jones (Monty Python) all pulled together to create a wonderful fantasy that is sure to be enjoyed by any age. I was 15 when I first saw it and I'm 30 now. I still watch it at least once a week with my daughters who absolutely adore it. This movie is definately a MUST SEE in my book. I've never met anyone who didn't enjoy it and I'm not sure I'd like to."
2,Just a decoration,"Actually, it is beautiful to have this barometer in a room, but, that is it, i will mark and react to pressure, but it is silly, there is no fun in it, i thought the readings would be better or more fun, it is just water with color and an icon of a sun and a cloud.... so? BORING!"
4,I really like this clock,"I wish that the projection feature was available on other Oregon Scientific Weather Stations. It is a great idea. I also need humidity shown and would like multiple sensor capabilities to check the outside conditions and the conditions in the greenhouse. Not that all that need be displayed on the ceiling, but that feature may still make it worth buying!"
1,Two Problems with Brand New Clock,"Just received this today. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! One reason I bought it was the ability to display outside temperature. Even though the remote sensor displays the temperature accurately, the ""in/out"" button on the clock will not toggle between indoor and outdoor temperature, so all you can ever see is the indoor temp.I also bought this for the projection feature. According to the book, if you press the snooze button the projector will come on for five seconds. No go. I cannot get the projector to work under any circumstance.I will be returning this piece of junk tomorrow."
2,Misleading Picture and Description!,"Know that the so called 'back-lighting' only stays on for 5 seconds, and then only when you hit the snooze button. So, you can barely see the clock, even in a well-lit room. The picture shows what it looks like with the back lighting on, not what it looks like most of the time. The projected time is only bright enough to be seen at night; however, even that is just barely true. I'm most upset about the backlighting. If I could, I would keep the backlight on all the time."
2,time for a new clock,"We've owned one of these for about three years. The wireless outdoor thermometer stopped working within the first year, and now the projected display is missing some segments. The weather forecaster says it's raining sometimes when the sun is shining."
3,"Nice buy, but projection light doesn't last.","Okay the clock itself is great. However, the projection light, if you leave it on, won't last that long. I would have thought they were using an blue LED for it, but since it stopped working, apparently not. So I suggest getting the clock and save your money."
5,Indoor/Outdoor Weather Forecaster,"We purchased this item through Amazon. We had seen it at a home in TN. It's great, accurate indoors and out, it's expensive but the quality of the product and the accuracy make it worth the price. We had tried another product from a local store, it cost less than half the price, but it was not accurate and the indoor temp soon stopped registering. ""You Get What You Pay For"" is oh so true!"
5,Great item!,"This item is very nice, it projects the weather and is very accurate. It will say the weather for the following day. It projects big bold letters that are easy to see!"
1,Poorly Designed,Atomic clock did not receive radio signal. Tried for 3 days. Had to set it manually. Remote sensor did not work unless it was right next to it. Power cable is a huge pain to connect if you plan on using it to travel. Can't read the display unless your room is VERY bright. Display light makes an annoying buzz when pressed. Projection works good. Hard to set alarm. Manual sucks.
1,engineers will be engineers,"I have to give this device two stars...First of all, no radio.And my biggest complaint: when will engineers start realizing that an alarm clock is something that people use to wake up with, not just look at to see how cool it looks.If I want to hit the snooze button, dont make me press a tiny little button... give me a big area to smack the clock with to get a snooze. I'm tired of thinking I'm pressing the snooze button only to realize I've accidentally turned the alarm completely off.Wake up engineers!"
3,Not the Best Product,"After reading mix reviews about this projection clock, I bought this just for the try of it. After all, I've never owned an self-set atomic clock.I received my product about a month ago. Everything works well, including the outdoor transmitter. I have one complain so far: The manual clearly states that users can turn on the projector ""for 5 seconds"" by pressing the snooze button. However, on my device, I have to either turn the projector ON or OFF. The snooze button doesn't do a thing about the projector.I tried to contact (e-mail) Oregon's customer service for advice, but it's been a month and I have yet to hear an answer from them.Minor problem? Major annoyance? You decide."
1,Great Clock but Weather way off,I bought 2 of these for Christmas presents both indoor/outdoor weather temps were way off (5-10 degrees). Never did get signal for outdoor temp. Clock worked great but nothing else. First time to return product to Amazon - they made the return easy. I do not recommend this product. 2 out of 2 with same problem.
5,Just Jazz...,"THis cd is very nice this is the first cd i bought when i started on my music journey into Nancy. i heard this cd at a dinner party, and had to have it. this is her 3rd cd. just listen to her voice its so clear and fined tuned even in her higher range she does it effortlessly. take a hear of it, and you will be pleased u got this cd."
3,Not what I expected,"I love Nancy Wilson's voice and singing skills, which are higher than those of most jazz singers, and I miss her in most tracks of the CD. She makes this disc great.George Shearing, though, is not very inspired here. His is the most boring version of 'I remember Clifford' I've ever heard. The rest is his usual style (you can like it or not), only a little worse and slower than usual.I'm not really sure George Shearing is a good choice for such an elastic singer. If you want to enjoy Nancy Wilson in a real jazz environment give a try to her disc with Cannonball Adderley: (Nancy Wilson & Cannonball Adderley). Or, better, listen her singing 'Alfie'."
2,Very disappointed!,"I was ready to be inspired by what sounded like a great movie. The return missionary did NOT act like one. Going into a bar over and over? Drinking apple juice so people thought he was drinking???? Get real! He could have waited outside to talk to his mom or better yet, outside her house. This movie had great potential but fell desperately short of the mark in so many ways. If you watch it, DON'T go into it with high expectations and you might enjoy it."
4,Very Nice,smells just like pina colada i was looking for a lip balm that smelled like this and this was the one but only put alittle bit on if you put too much on it can be sicky shippig was exclent and fast
3,i - like it,"I had vaguely heard of The Magnetic Fields, so I was curious to hear what the hype was about for their first major album release. Quirky often comes off as a put down, often meaning out of the mainstream but enjoyable. But that's how ""i"" comes off. It sounds like if They Might Be Giants and Jonathan Richman had a child. It's chockfull of sad, ironic lyrics with undeniable catchy hooks. Probably the most commericial track here is ""I Thought You Were My Boyfriend"", which make people think this was a Joy Division demo. The fact it's a guy singing this tune makes it one of the strangest sounding break-up songs since White Town's ""Your Woman"". Maybe such comparisons are not fair. This is truly a unique album on its own merit. It won't sell as many albums as Brittany, Madonna, or Christina. But this album deserves a spin simply because it's probably one of the most fascinating albums you'll hear this year."
2,What are you using it for?,"I bought the FD87 thinking that I would never run out of media on long trips; I could always go buy more disks, or erase some shots. Unfortunately I didn't consider how inconvienient that would be. Lugging 40 floppy disks around Disney Land along with a bulky camera was not fun. Taking it skiing was a whole other pain in the rear. Another problem is the inherent unreliability of floppy disks. I have lost many shots due to disk errors. I liked the Mpeg mode when I bought it, until I discovered you cannot stop the camera once you begin recording. This is stupid. The camera takes good pictures, if your activity is taking pictures. Do not, however, buy this camera if you plan to take pictures while involved in any other activity. It is very impractical. There are two good points though. The battery lasts forever and the camera formats disks about 20 times faster than a PC."
3,Sony MVC-FD87 Digital Camera,This camera was on sale for 350 dollars at Christmas time when is it going on sale again. If they can do it once they can do it again.
2,THIS PRODUCT WORKS TO BLOCK OUT BLUE LIGHT WHEN WATCHING TV LATE AT NIGHT,"HOWEVER, IF YOU USE PRECRIPTION GLASSES, BETTER LOOK AROUND FOR CLIP ON LENS AS THESE DO NOT SAY PUT, AND MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE PROGRAM"
3,Love Saint Etienne - but 2 discs?!?,"I think a 2 disc greatest hits is a bit much for Saint Etienne. They could have easily fit their best songs on one disc and saved us the trouble of having to skip through the not so fabulous tracks they've recorded. Despite the flipping, its an overall a fun record."
1,Poor products - bad service,"I cannot recommend this product at all. It failed after a short time, approx 3 1/2 months. I tried four times to contact their support dept. with NO RESPONSE. When I finally got through, they refused to doing anything about the defective products. (I should have known; any product with only a 90 day warranty cannot be a quality product)The product is also badly engineered with irritating features. There is nothing inherently wrong with cable-free products, but this manufacturer isn't making quality products."
2,Don't go wireless,"This is a great idea for the home hobbyist weather watcher. Major flaw is the instruction/setup information. No information about how to use this weather station. It sort of tells you how to hook it up but nothing else. It's not an intuitive setup, in fact it's very confusing. The worst documentation I've ever seen and that includes their on-line data. Forget this wireless station - it's hardly ever works. Go for the wired/cable weather station for more reliable information and ease of use."
2,Oregon weather station,"I purchased this weather station because I wanted one that would give me wind speed and direction in addition to temperature and humidity. It's great. I was concerned that the wireless feature would not work well at the advertised distance, but discovered that it works beyond that. I've not used the rain gauge because there's not much rain in the desert, but I'll probably hook it up for the late summer monsoons.Checking my reviews I found this one that needs updating. The station lasted about six months and quit working all together. I replaced it with a Davis Vantage Pro2. The Davis is more money, but I've had no problems and it's a MUCH better station."
1,Do Not Waste Your Time & Money,I thought Oregon Scientific was a reputable name and believed this unit would provide a lot of interesting weather information for our specific location. Not so. It was time-consuming to set up and the batteries need to be changed every 6 months. This involved unscrewing many extremely small screws from each unit and then attempting to reset them all units with the main unit nearly simultaneously. The units are outdoors and it's easy to lose the tiny screws if dropped in the yard.Our unit worked for a little over 6 months. Customer support was not helpful. I am making a mental note to never buy another Oregon Scientific product. The time and money we lose for such a few months was definitely not worth it.
2,Look Out - Buyer Beware,"The outdoor temp/humidity sensor failed within the warranty. However, the company has been stalling on replacing it. Their excuse: the item is on backorder. I returned the failed item on 18 Jun 2008 and, as of 4 Sep 2008, the still offer same ""back order"" excuse. I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and Oregon Scientific did not reply, In fact, according to the BBB, two follow ups inquiries by the BBB to my complaint have gone unanswered.Moving on, the directions/instructions for the weather station are totally useless: I challenge anyone to get this thing to operate with the enclosed ""instructions."""
3,A little disappointed,As with all the other reviews the directions on this thing leave a lot to the imagination. One issue I had that I had not read was the silicone over the set screws for the wind direction and speed sensors. I found it extremely difficult to turn the set screw to lock on the sensors. I still have not gotten the directional vein set completely.I think the most disappointing part of this is the fact the display does not stand upright as all the pictures seem to indicate. It actually only can lay down on its back with the equivalent of keyboard legs on the back that may put it at a 5 to 10 degree angle which makes it necessary to stand over it to read it.And one thing I failed to realize is the lack of an atomic clock. Another real disappointment.You remove those two issues and I would not have any complaints on this device. At least not at this time. I have read of sensors failing after a year or two so I have to wait to see how that pans out.
3,Millie Jackson Live! Sunset Junction Street Festival,"Im a big fan of Millie jackson when my parents went out, i put on Millie's records and she cursed and talked about adult topics that other singers glossed over, her subjects on record were more close to what was really going on, in adult relationships! in this dvd she singings some of her older songs,back in love by Monday, hurt so good,but some of her past hits are missing,What good here is a song called the lies that we live.and the easy street band is on the money. and she sing some songs for her not for church folks cd"
2,"Did not like rubber bottom because I use taps on heel which I could not apply. Sent them back , ran narrow",did not like rubber bottom because have to use taps on heel and could not apply and shoes ran narrow sent back
3,Nice but,"This is worth the price--especially the price online--but when screwing it in you have to be very careful not to put the screw on the thread line (which happens to be in the middle of the area were you put the screw!), or the thread will wrap up in the screw. This might not happen if you have a really fast drill. On the other hand, it happens fairly easily because you have to put in the screws upside down if you install it as shown (with the top flap folded in).Still, once it is in, it is great."
2,Disappointed by the price increase,"I ordered two bumpers for $18.35 to check out the quality before I ordered more. I liked them, went back two weeks later to order more and the price had jumped to over $30 for the exact same bumpers. At that price you can buy something better at a marine supply store. At the old price they were a good value for the money, not so much now."
5,Fascinating and Great!,"[Pricey] for 6 CDs of 70-yr old recordings is no bargain, but the Bear Family will probably put the money to good use. The oversize (LP-size) packaging is a little annoying, but features a nice picture of Mr. Rodgers on the cover. The oversize (that's why they needed that big box) softcover book has some interesting information & more nice pictures. The sound is much cleaner than on my old LPs, and perhaps a little less warm. And the music is priceless. Some cuts are forgettable, but why nitpick? 'Better too much Jimmie Rodgers than not enough! This is great American music for anyone lucky enough to have ears to hear."
3,For small room practice only,"It's hard to knock something of this quality that costs so little, so I won't. I will say that this is strictly a practice amp, and even as a practice amp it doesn't deliver satisfying low notes, even at low volume.I bought one as a present for a young nephew learning bass guitar and double bass, and it made him happy. But I'd suggest to anyone looking for a decent small amp that they consider the Drive 300B for about $40 more. It's a lot more amp."
4,solid,"yeah, solid album....worth peeping....if yo got xtra cash, go get tha Album Southern Slang...it's off tha chain, the beats are frigging bangin' lyrics are on level with Tupac, Biggie, Nas....if yo ain't heard them, get them, I met these homies and they gonna be big"
4,Don't Answer the Phone...,"I have never understood the chapbook industry. Paying a lot for a single short story just doesn't seem right. But, when I can find one used for a decent price, I might check it out.Cora has just moved into a new apartment and had her new phone installed. But on the very first day she receives a call. The voice says he wants to be her friend. Cora is understandably upset and calls her boyfriend for reassurance. Everything will be fine, her boyfriend says, as long as the caller doesn't know her name or address.The next call calls Cora by name. He says he can see her. Cora becomes frightened. But in the end her fears are not what they should be as the story takes some very interesting twists.Despite the shortness of this story, Laymon does an excellent job of building the suspense and then delivering the goods. Few authors could have pulled this one off in so few words.I wouldn't recommend paying a lot for this one but it is worth reading."
4,a must-read for Cait London's fans,"If you, like me, share a deep passion for endearing and slightly quirky characters then this is the romance for you. I have devoured all of Cait London's Tallchief series for just those reasons, I must admit to getting a kick out of this family's eccentricities. ""The Seduction of Fiona Tallchief"" must be one of my favourites yet and that's no mean feat when the series was so brilliant from the get go."
1,Not Worth The Money,"What can I say. Bugs, bugs, bugs. 3D is SLOW. Control over roof dimensions is nonexistant. Very limited texture library. This program tries to ""guess"" what you are doing and this often leads to bugs such as unwanted walls, roofs that won't generate, computer freeze-ups and hours upon hours of wasted time. Debugging takes WAY more time than just starting over from scratch. My advice, don't buy it."
1,Buggy Version 4.0,"This version of the software has so many bugs it is difficult to list them and technical support just says ""oh well..."" This version does not allow you to dxf out properly if you are going to finish the drawings with another CAD package like AutoCAD. You can not do standard interior dimensioning in such areas as the position of door openings allong a wall. You can not print on anything larger than legal size paper, renderings produce occasional errors and drop-outs... This version really does not add any useable features and has introduced many bugs. Purchase version 3.0 which is at least somewhat reliable."
2,Great Tutorial LOUSY UPGRADE,"This is a great program for the money. But stick with version v3, v4 is really a DOWNGRADE from v3. It's is very, very buggy compared to v3 and slow in rendering.The tutorial is very good and is the best way to learn the product."
1,wrong product,"I'm training for a marathon and to minimize leg/feet stress & maximize cross-training, I was looking for something to do 'pool running' with.This product may have its uses, but water jogging isn't one of them! You have to straddle the item and hold it with your hands, which means no arm swinging.If you're looking for something for 'pool running', my advice is to avoid this item :("
3,"Get ""The Snake"" instead","The only reason to get this album is if you're a hardcore fan of Shane and you want to get songs like ""Danny Boy"" or ""Cracklin Rosie"" but most of all of his good stuff is on ""The Snake"". Don't bother with the CD or ""Crock of Gold"" either it is depressing since his songs are slurred with the years of drug and alcohol abuse he is famous for. The songs are lifeless. I know his hardcore fans don't like to admit this but he was washed up on ""Crock of Gold"". If you don't believe how sub par his songs were to the Pogues listen to the Pogues version of ""Rake at the Gates of Hell"" and his version. Enough said."
4,A Little too Clean,"This book of Paiute legends originated in southern Utah well after European man and his religion had impacted the Native Americans. The tales all smack strongly of a biblical influence and are substantially at odds with more academic works of similar nature. The stories are good ones and have grains of other Paiute legends within them, however. Given the residence and affiliation of the author and the publisher it is no surprise that the stories were indeed used by Mr. Palmer at scout camp fireside story times - good clean-cut stories of heros and adventures suitable for young men and women - but not too much like the stories as literally (or nearly so) translated by other authors during about the same time frame, but, admittedly for Paiute and Washoe bands from further to the north and less influenced by the advent of European men into the area."
4,Excellent,"John Paul Jones--yes, him--produced Independant Worm Saloon, and you can tell.Jones takes the Surfers experimental noise and condences it to tight songs. The offhand playing and avant sheets of the band are in full force, but on tracks like ""Alcohol' and many others, it thrives within the tight formats Jones enforcesThe punk attitude is not lost, and where Jones may have done some heavy editing here, the sound of the Surfers is never watered down--""Clean It Up"" provides more than enough proof.Great album"
5,kick sssssssss!!!!!!11,independant worm saloon is my favorite album of all times! one big rush from song 1 - till the end!
3,not their best...,"I always feel really dirty when I listen to this Cd. The last song is disgusting, I would really rather not listen to someone vomit. Obviously they have some talent, you can tell that if you listen to the album, but take my advice, get it used, or something. Unless your a devoted fan, go get a Flipper Cd."
5,Best Puzzle Ever!,"This is possibly my favorite puzzle I have ever done. The finished product is both beautiful and entertaining to look at, and just so much fun to put together. It's hard enough to be challenging, but easy enough to be fun and relaxing. Highly recommend. This is one of the few puzzles my children will help me with:)"
4,Best British Cozy,"In my opinion, this is one of the best british cozies and should be a classic. The characters are wonderfully British and eccentric.Flora is charming,of course, but it seems unbelievable that a 17 year old girl has only been to London once in her life-she seems unusually isolated from the real world! Another favorite character is the gentlemanly Sir Henry who reluctantly marries the forceful Mabel Bower.I just read this for the second time and thoroughly enjoyed it.I would like to see another mystery with these characters."
5,Sinatra at his Peak,"Hearing Sinatra Here is a Must.He SOunds Like He is on Top Of The world.His Voice is On Beat.I've Got You Under My Skin is Incredible.The Music&The Arrangements work so well Hand&Hand with Frank Sinatra's Tone.when You Hear his Voice You Know that You are Listening to History that is Timeless.You Feel The Emotions,Joy&Depth Of His Work."
2,No Support Options - What a Let Down,"I bought this product Barbie Photo Designer for my niece and needed to obtain support for the software and find drivers for the camera, the CD warped in the sun...Kids! Anyway after two days of searching and wild goose chases, I found that Mattel Interactive has gone under and Mattel Customer Service will not respond to my email requests for support."
1,BIG WASTE of a pile of money...,"Paid a fortune for this terrible camera at Bestbuy right after it came out. It won't even turn on. Let me advise you--neither Bestbuy nor Sony could give a hoot after you've plunked down the cash. You're on your own if you didn't buy one of Bestbuy's exhorbitantly priced ""extended warrantys."" I was sold this camera with the promise that it was cutting edge, would surely last a lifetime. My brother was so impressed he went out and bought the same camera only to have his break down even sooner. DO NOT, I repeat, do not buy this dud. Unless you have money to burn, spend your hard earned dollars on a camera that lives up to its promises."
2,Blurry no matter what I do,"I read the reviews for this camera in several places online before purchase. I have to say I am quite disappointed. Two out of three images are blurry no matter what and in low light conditions that jumps to five out of six or worse. I have tried every setting, spoken with Sony support, and the only way to get a clear picture is to use a tripod with the timer. When it does take a clear picture they are very nice, you can see a lot of detail and the color rendering is quite good. But what is the point. I have to take several pictures of everything and even then I might not get a clear one. Also, the memory stick that comes with it will not support the highest video resolution - you need a memory stick pro for that. The next time I buy a digital camera I am getting one with image stabilization. What a waste of money."
2,Didn't Hold Up Over Time,"After less than three years of use, and after $300 in additional lenses, my DSC-W1 was inoperable most of the time. After one year of flawless performance, the cheapness of the camera began to show.First the lens transport mechanism failed, so I sent it in for $180 worth of repairs. Now less than a year later, the camera does not recognize battery levels in any photo/movie mode. It will display a full battery icon, but only after just one photo, it thinks the battery is dead and shuts off. I'd be an idiot to send it for service again for another $180.Bottom Line: If you are looking for a simple, good, compact point-and-shoot camera that will last you a year, Sony's Cybershots will do the trick.But if you are careful with your equipment and are used to getting three to five years out of your electronic devices, then don't buy a Sony Cybershot. They just don't last."
4,My best friend!,"After researching an affordable, good-quality digital camera for months, I bought the Sony DSCW1. I have had this camera for 7 months, and though I do not know about its durability, (I see reviews against it) I absolutely love it. It takes beautiful shots, has a short recovery time, and is user-friendly. The larger-than-usual screen is awesome! I recommend this camera to everyone. :)"
5,Awesome Construction!,"This is a great puzzle, the picture is clear and you can look at each piece and find where it goes from the picture, not all muddled together. Great!"
4,My puzzle is mirrored!,I'm very excited to do this puzzle and am equally thrilled to have been introduced to this fabulous artist. One problem: my puzzle is a mirror image of the original artwork! The lettering on the arch above the stairs is backwards -- the whole puzzle is flipped! Has anyone else had this problem? I have confirmed that both the picture on the box and the pieces inside are flipped.I have contacted SunsOut via the customer service email address supplied inside the box. Hopefully this can be resolved with them or Amazon.
1,Not for a club car golf cart!,I saw in the reviews that this would work on a golf cart. It does NOT work for a club car. We had to give it away to a family member who has an ez go and it works on theirs.
5,A True Study of Jewish Home Life,"This book is a beautifully honest and fair portrayal of the sights, sounds, and emotions of a 1950's - 1960's New York area Jewish home. Sophie Portnoy is the Jewish mother archetype - so true to life in fact, that I literally trembled whenever she spoke. The ""Jewish view"" of the gentile world, particularly Alex's view of shiksas (tartan, nose structure, etc.), is equally compelling and honest. In its time, the autosexual and sexual passages took ""ganze chutspah"" from Roth, but again the result was the same - truth. An extremely entertaining novel of brutal honesty."
2,Trash!,"I resisted reading this piece of trash when it was first released in a blaze of controversy some 50 years ago but in a moment of weakness, out of sheer curiosity, I recently purchased it for my Kindle because it was dirt cheap.Now, half a century later, 'Dirt' and 'cheap' are still two very appropriate words to apply to this book. If you like reading about a guy whose sexual deviations know no bounds then this is the book for you. It has nothing else going for it."
2,Portnoy's Complaint,"Portnoy's Compaint started off well but it drags. it lacks substance, though at 50 plus maybe i'm too old for it."
2,Whiney Jewish New Yorkers,"I found this book to be racist. Maybe Jewish people might enjoy it. And it is terribly disrespectful of women. In terms of entertainment, I simply was not entertained."
4,Definitely NC-17 and quite perverse.,"I was going to write that in some ways this book was most riveting, however, it is mostly just troubling. Definitely NC-17 and quite perverse. At any rate, I thought it read a lot like a New Jersey Jew version of Wise Blood, Flannery O'Connor's brilliant story about the futility of trying to elude Jesus. Alex Portnoy does everything he can in a vain attempt to corrupt and reject his Jewish heritage. Like Hazel Motes rejecting his Christianity in O'Conner's Wise Blood, he fails miserably."
5,Hilarious critique of Protestant American culture,"This book--like the split-screen dinner-table scene in ANNIE HALL--is a wonderful critique of upper-middle-class Protestant America. For this same sense of the sheer silliness of modern American manners, read Russell David Harper's existential and comic novel BALD."
4,craps on a budget,nice layout could be better felt but not bad fun to do when you don't want to go to the casino
2,not too bad,"i thought with william harts age he is doing ok, we can't really expect him to hit the same notes he did back in the day but he still sounds pretty good. my problem is that the delfonics are a group, i really like to watch the choreography and on this dvd a lot of the camera is on william hart who as i know is the leader but i think their award winning dance routines are a big part of their act and should be shown also. That was my biggest problem with the 70's soul jam concert dvd too much camera time on the audience and the violin players not enough focus on the main performers especally wilberts harts delfonics and the whispers."
5,A most insidious mousetrap....,"Dame Agatha knew exactly what she was doing. In the sense that the payoff of a detective story is in the denouement, the moment where all is revealed to the consternation of the reader, Curtain is quite possibly her best work. Other reviewers have pointed out, quite validly, that her characters in this one (particularly Poirot) are perhaps not as riveting as other novels. No matter. The astonishing final chapter brings it all right back into focus. As only Agatha Christie could do it, everything was right in front of your eyes the whole time, but you drew all the wrong conclusions from it. Dame Agatha has even used your notions of Poirot's character absorbed from other novels to lead you astray! Other Poirot novels may be more ""entertaining"", but nowhere embodies that sheer amazement of realizing how you've just been led step by step down the garden path."
4,GOOD,"This book was really sad! After reading a lot of books about Hercule, it can really bring a tear to your eye. I think this is probably the first book you should read about Hercule Poirot.Anyway, the plot was really good, and the murder was surprising, but I was a bit disappointed with it, since it was Hercule Poirot's last case, and I think Agatha Christie should have made it a bit more twisting and complicated, but it was still really good, and I definately think it is worth reading."
5,Get your copy NOW!,"The most talented theater stars (Colm Wilkinson, Bernadette Peters, Michael Ball, Lea Salonga, Jonathan Pryce, and many, many more) performing some of musical theater history's greatest works. A real treat for musical theater fans!P.S. Get BOTH the video and the CD for the complete experience."
2,Poor Proofreading,"Although this product provides clear, concise descriptions of 2000 topics, there are constant, egregious errors in the transliteration of Sanskrit and Pali terms. These errors occur even in the headwords of some entries, rendering a search for the correct term impossible. Some of the errors are simply unpronounceable, and so one is almost forced to ask if this work was proofread by a qualified person. This is not the standard I have come to expect from Oxford Dictionaries. I would rather have ordered the bound edition at four times the price."
2,Ehh,"A fair strategy guide, the 159-page book does not have all of the information accurate (like the Offering to the Gods system and the soldiers requiring 1-3 gold). There are a fair number of tactics and one to two pages of strategy on each map. I expected some new and useful information though, and I'm disappointed."

1,This clock is terrible,This clock is terrible. I purchased for my husband for Christmas it stopped working today July 20. We got almost 7months out of it.
1,Kids Toy,"The Alarm on this is so quiet it won't even wake the dogs up. the time can only be projected about 2 feet and then you can't see it. I need an alarm that can wake the dead. Seriously though the alarm sounds just like the alarm on my watch, except quieter."
1,The projector faded and I can no longer see the numbers,"I really enjoyed this clock for the couple years I've had it, but the numbers are fading and I can no longer read them on the ceiling. In Addition, Oregon Scientifics' customer service is lousy. They won't respond to emails on the web site and when I visited their store at Bridgeport Village in Portland Oregon the guy working there was extremely rude. I doubt I will replace it. It's still working as an atomic clock, but the projector is useless!Oh, and the alarm buzzer is really obnoxious and gets faster and faster the longer it takes you to get to it to turn it off. If you want to wake up in a frenzy, then this is a clock for you :oO"
1,Very short life of projection,We only had it for couple of months and projection stopped working. Then it became useless for us. Projection clock is a greatest idea which even gave me better sleeps since I don't have to move to check the time. It is unfortunate that is such a short life product.
5,Love It!,"This is a fantastic clock! My son loves it. I have finally gotten his room to stay warm at night. There were nights it was chilly, but, having the temp in his room made it easy to keep the temp even."
5,Cool alarm clock for kid,"I bought this clock for my 7-year-old son and he LOVED it. Not only does it look kind of ""cool"" it does some pretty amazing things. The projection onto the ceiling was the biggest hit - he'd never seen anything like it. Plus the fact that it was talking to a satelite to adjust the time so that it's always accurate was very amazing as well. It was easy to set, easy to read, and works very well."
5,Small Atomic Alarm Clock,"I love this little atomic alarm clock. It's always at the correct time, it takes up little space and the alarm starts out very quiet and becomes progressively louder each time it rings. The projected time on the ceiling is in large red numbers and you have no problem being able to see the time. Because it's Atomic, you always know you have the correct time. I definitely recommend it. Because of it's small size, it would be very convenient to travel with."
1,Buy something Different,"Bought two of these for my kids, they look cool but the functionality is weak. The atomic clock set feature is constantly off and clock re-sets to incorrect times. The snooze on the alarm could be described as difficult at best, and the projection is not impressive. Also, good luck trying to tune and set radio stations. They weren't worh sending back and I am sure they will be 50 cent items at the first yard sale of the summer."
5,Great!,"This album is really good, I've been listening to it non stop since i got it about a week ago ^_^ Mostly remixes of songs you'll remember, and some new ones in there too. It's a lot of music for just 2 cds, and I say well worth it :)"
1,Major Disapointment - No Tuner,"The radio looks nice when you remove it from the box. The controls are laid out well and it looks like it is built to take a beating. I can't comment on the CD player or any of the other features. This went right back in the box when I discovered the tuner is absolute junk.I was able to tune in one or two stations very clearly and the sound quality was good. The five or six other local stations I tried were nearly impossible to distinguish becasue of bleed over and had terrible sound quality. If you need a radio with tuner that works, keep looking. This isn't it."
4,Great sound,The radio sounds loud and clear...no static at all. The only drawback (which is my problem not the product) is that is is very big...not heavy though...just big. I didn't look at the dimensions before I purchased it and the size surprised me. Service was excellent and the overall product is great.
4,Very Pleased With CD Player,"This player has good sound, works great. It seems to be everything advertised. The only problem I've encountered it a lack of the AM spectrum of the radio dial. If it's there I can't find it. It's is large, but if that is not a problem buy this player."
3,"It is surely a heavy- duty unit, however the sound quality could be better","I bought it as a present to my son after his boombox stopped playing CDs.AM/FM Radio: I have no complaints here- it picks up local radio stations and it is a good clear reception.CD Player: I played a CD- no problems here too.Sound Quality: I was a bit disappointed with the sound quality of the boombox because the old boombox was more pleasant to ear than the new one. It does not have presets for concert, hall and other environments. There is no graphical equalizer. It seems like it lacks highs and deepness of the sound.Final verdict- It is designed to withstand some abuse for example, riding in the car. It is dust-proof and shock-resistant. It does what it's supposed to do, but the sound quality sucks- lacks lows and especially highs, and it makes the sound ""shallow"". That's why I am giving the unit 3 stars."
3,good sound with a flaw,any carpenter worth his salt will tell you the most important tool on the job is the sound system.the last sony i had was the called the outback and it worked up to standards and is the reason i bought sony again.zs-h10cp puts out great sound but has in my opinion two serious flaws#1 is the cord is not hard-wired and very delicate#2 is the dust / water seal and latch on the cd is very poorother than those two issues i am very satisfiedsteve from santa barbara ca.
2,"Great as CD player,HORRIBLE radio","The strength of this product is it's sound and apparent durability; the glaring weakness is its tuner. I can't remember having a radio, modern or old, with a worse tuner. In a crowded FM market like Chicago's, the ability to select between close frequencies is critical: this tuner can't do it. It's noisy, and imprecise rendering the radio almost useless. If you're playing CDs only this may not be important; but if you're in the trades or like to play at the trades, look elsewhere. Unless you drag along CDs or an iPod (and why no dock, just a mini plug?) everywhere, this is not the unit for you. I should also note the clunky transformer, that doesn't conveniently store anywhere; it's halfway down the length of the power cord and doesn't stow nicely in the compartment at the back of the boombox. Since this box is no lightweight or compact unit to start with, I'm not sure why the transformer wasn't integrated into the box in the first place. Nice idea, lousy execution."
5,Another great Sony purchase,"Purchased this as a boombox to take floating on the guadalupe river, to take to the dove hunting lease, and to use in the shop at work. It has done all three on the same set of batteries - over 36 hours so far and still going. Most of this was on radio or line in, as I haven't used the CD player yet. The sound is also great, even without the mega bass feature enabled. The fact that the unit can play mp3's burned to a CD is an added plus and I didn't know it did that until it arrived. I did have some reception issues on the river, but switched to Pandora and used the line in. I highly recommend this for those looking for some portable jams to take anywhere where music for everyone isn't."
4,sony zsh10cp,"Great product !!! I just purchsed my second one. The first one lasted about 6 years of hard use, snow,left out in rain over night (more than one time) sleet,sand you name it! Great sound easy to use. Its a very basic system, nothing fancy but gets the job done very well. So if your into gizzmos and bling bling keep shopping but you want great sound and something you can throw in the back of your truck or off a cliff its a winner"
3,boombox,ok so this will sound wierd but I got this for my dog who is afraid of thunder. We had an old boom box that wore out so decided to get a new one. He says to tell you that this one is AOK. We also needed one for when out power goes out - which is often. So we are very happy with this purchase. - both dog and family. What more can you ask for???!!!Ok so I did not tell you that when it thunders we try to get him to go to the basement - turn up the boom box on a classical station and turn on the washer (yes with clothes in it) and the dryer.This works very well for him. In case you are interested his name is Sampson - he is a labrabor rescue dog and we have had him for about 6-7 years. He had this problem when he came to us and it took us quite some time to work it all out for him. He is now about 12-14. So if you care about dogs - please rescue one. And then get them neutered. THanks from us and Sampson .
2,Sony Heavy Duty Boom-box,I am not totally satisfied with this purchase. Inadequate bass: no tone control. The electrical cvord is very un-manageable.
5,Great Shop BoomBox,"I use this boombox in a machine shop where the machinery can get pretty loud and it sounds awesome. I had bought 2 boomboxes before this one and returned them both because they would not get loud enough for us to hear. I love the fact that it plays MP3s. 1 cd will last us the entire day. We can also hook up MP3 players to it to listen to. I love the bright red color. When I walk in the shop in the morning I can easily figure out where night crew left it. Since we are in a metal building it can be hard to catch radio stations so the night crew tends to move it around to catch the ""big game"" of the evening. Overall I would highly recommend this portable radio. It was a great buy for me."
3,The best I can get for now.,"I've owned this radio for about two years. Replaced a previous heavy duty Sony radio/CD player that finally gave out. While I like a durable radio for work, the controls are minimal. There is one button to turn off the ""Megabass,"" but no real treble/bass controls. Radio reception is nil in any hilly area. It takes quite a few turns of the volume control to increase the volume to an adequate level. It eats batteries up and could really use an adapter for plugging into the accessory port on the truck. The 120 volt power cord has the power adapter at the wall plug end, which is very inconvenient when sharing a plug with other devices. It has no clock, which would be a big plus for a work radio. It has a CD player, which most work site radios don't have, and an external input port. The telescoping metal antenna is prone to breaking and should be replaced with a flexible antenna. But it is durable, and except for the antenna, will hold up to hard use."
1,No Heat Neck Massager,"Just as Cynthia Fuben complained in her review, this neck massager produces no heat. The subtle vibration is pleasant but will not relax the tensed neck muscles without heat. Nice ad but poor performance. I suggest you look for a product that actually provides the elements that are advertised on the box. There are products in the marketplace that actually do what they claim, so I am going to return this product and find one that actually produces heat AND has a real vibrating mechanism in it. BEWARE THE WORD ""GENTLE VIBRATION"" !!!David Hall"
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!,"This doesn't even deserve 1 star. This supposed ""relaxation"" gadget was a complete waste of time and money. It had NO HEAT as advertised and the vibration just left my ears itching. (...) Instead of relaxing, it has increased my stress level 150%!! (...)"
3,This is no Goodnight Moon,"We love Goodnight Moon. Who doesn't enjoy that nighttime routine staple? We received this (and the Run Away Bunny) as gifts. This book doesn't have the same simple word construct as GM. It's halting, awkward and clear that it was written many years ago. Even if it weren't outdated, it doesn't have the same flow as GM. Wouldn't buy it or recommend it. The Run Away Bunny is really sweet though."
1,Confusing and Weird,"""Goodnight Moon"" is my two year old's favorite book EVER - so boy, were we disappointed in this ""companion"" book. Apart from the pleasing familiarity of the pictures, there is no hypnotic rhythm to the text, and the activities of the characters are dated and sexist (Mama cooks, while Dad sits on the porch and puffs on his pipe. NOT the view of the world I want to fix in my son's head!)."
1,My World Book,"My daughter LOVES Goodnight Moon, so when she saw there were more books to go along with Goodnight Moon she was so excited & ready to see what would happen next. Well.....The book (My World) was a disappointment! My World is NOT comparable to Goodnight Moon. This was a one time read only!"
1,Don't get unless bundled with Goodnight Moon and Runaway Bunny,"Not soothing like Goodnight Moon, nor whimsical like the Runaway Bunny. There is no ""rhyme or reason"" to this book; no flow from page to page and often even from line to line. It is almost like an attempt at haiku mishmashed with very random wordplay. Honestly, anyone with a little creativity and a high school degree could write a better book in an hour. My 20 month old daughter doesn't seem to totally hate it, but on the other hand, we'll read many of her other books almost every night. And from the adult point of view, I'd almost rather have my teeth drilled than to have to read from this book. It's that bad."
4,Strategy from the Japanese Warrior,"The Book of Five Rings is similar to Sun Tzu Art of War in that is discusses strategy, fighting, and competition from a combat perspective. The book is small in size and easy for reading while traveling. While references can found that comment this is as a book for management, it is still very much a book about combat and the samurai warrior. Interesting nontheless."
2,"The book is good, the translation is not...",Musashi's words are great but the translation is not so good. There are misinterpretations of the meaning of the text because it is not translated from any experience with Japanese swordsmanship and the special technical vocabulary of swordsmanship. Plus the author includes part of Yagyu Munenori's (another master swordsman) text in it. It is not focused but rather confused. It includes both to make the book more marketable. There are better and more accurate translations out there.
2,Not what I expected,"I wanted to read the Japanese classic with some commentary, but mostly the Japanese classic. What I got with this book was ""The Book of The Five Rings Greatest Hits"" or ""How to use Old Books to Make a Killing on Wall Street."" I'm very disappointed in the book and if you are looking for Asian classics, read the description very carefully."
4,good camera,"the price is reasonable, this camera has some interesting features like aperture priority, speed priority and manual modes, brackening, and exposure lock, manual focus, two slots ( SD and memmory stick duo). cons: it does not have a volume control when reproducing MPEG 4 videos, does not have flash level control and burst feature.The price VS benefits offer a good result, good display with rotation"
4,A nice item,"The storage bench is a really nice item. The only thing was that the instructions were a bit confusing and the lid rubs when opened or shut. BUT this does confirm it to be airtight and prevents water from getting in. All in all, it is exactly what I wanted."
4,Best of Candid Camera,"The seller sent this out quickly, which I appreciated.Some of the video was quite entertaining, however, I remember seeing some of the Candid Camera shots from earlier days that in my mind were a lot funnier than the ones on this video."
1,disappointing follow up to Lady,"While the music on this, Modjo's follow-up album. is certainly well-produced and flows smoothly, it seems to be an attempt to revisit a late 1970s discotheque - a disappointing lack of innovation or interest. My recommendation: buy the stellar ""Lady"" single EP, skip this album."
5,Great Find,"Little camera....lotta fun!!!I bought this camera a few years ago and have loved it ever since. The pictures come out very clear. I choose to have mine printed at the local CVS and I edit them ahead of time. Though it takes an extra second for the zoom to frame the shot it's worth it.Having two toddler nieces I've been able to document many special moments, giggles, and smiles!!!I hope you enjoy this camera as much as I did.This is an easy to use point and shoot!!!Enjoy!!"
3,Super-ficial steam locomotives,"The problem with Brian Solomon is that he churns out so many books you have to worry about his research. This is a pretty superficial guide to US steam locomotives and gives a reasonable overview. But there are too many views of a limited number of engines and the whole thing has an air of being thrown together fairly quickly. This doesn't automatically make it a bad book, and it's a cheap way to acquire some decent quality steam photography. But expect more than that and you might be disappointed. Solomon is actually a good writer. I'd like fewer books from him, with more interesting subjects."
2,The new version?,"The selection and variety of cafes is broad and interesting. The writing is fine, but seems a little promo oriented; every cafe is great, the best, etc. Also, just wondering what the demographic is for this book, retirees? It seems a little frozen in time; a one-page interview with ""Beat poet Ruth Weiss""? Beats were interesting - maybe - in the 60's. Now, it's not interesting. Also, I don't know if the book has regressed, but the 4th edition, published in 2011 has no color pictures, unless you want to count the cover. Straight black and white photos and the people in them seem to be wearing non-2011 clothing and hairstyles. Hmmm. No reason to reward mediocrity - skip this lemon and look elsewhere for a modern book of San Francisco cafes."
5,A Hit at Our House,"My son received this car for his first birthday. At that time he did not have the fine motor skills needed to use the keys etc to fix the car, but he loves to push it on the floor and watch it go and crash when it bumped into things. It kept him busy in the kitchen in the evenings while I cooked.Now that it is coming closer to the two year mile marker, he is learning to use the keys to refuel the engine and fix the problems on the car when it breaks down. It is just challenging enough to him to be fun, and it also dishes out rewards when he gets it right.This toy is very durable and the planning that went into it is fantastic. It has just enough sounds to keep him entertained but not be annoying!A+ at our house!"
1,Don't buy this product,"This product was a big disappointment. It's not able to receive the US Atomic Clock signal in south Florida (Miami). I have tried it at several locations in Miami. It has also problems to receive signals from the remote sensor when it's placed more than 20 feet from the main unit. A friend and me bought one each and both units have the same problems. You cannot even switch from F to C on the main unit, something that you can do on every digital thermometer I have seen, even on a $ 5.00 thermometer. No, I will return this thermometer, it is a bad product."
4,"Time, Temperature and Humidity","I purchased this model to replace an older unit (RMR112A) because I wanted the added feature of humidity. I think it is a great device. The old unit and the new unit sitting side by side track room temperature within 1/2 degree.The radio controlled clock can be tempermental in some locations. I live in a condo with a lot of steel but I found that if I put the unit near a window for the first day and let the clock latch onto the time I can move the unit to where I want to set it and it will continue to keep accurate time. Mainly, it does this by searching at the right time of day when the signal is boosted by the Naval Observatory. (I have six radio controlled clocks and one watch that is radio controlled.)Battery life is very good. On the old outside unit I changed the batteries once a year (each summer).This would be a five star product if I could see the internal and external temperature and humidity without pressing a button."
2,Don't believe everything you read,"This book, while it comes across as quite erotic, reads like a collection of letters to Penthouse. None of the stories ring true. None of the stories have that uncomfortable fumbling of first encounters, the nervousness of being caught. It reads like straight out porn. Fine. This ""gets the job done"" if you are looking for a literary Viagra but in no way are any of these stories any more than out and out fiction. Not a single word jumps off the page with any ounce of authenticity. They all seem plausible, but the manner in which they are written (and in some cases exagerated) made me feel completely manipulated. No one I know has ever had a first encounter with a ""straight guy"" that ever sounded like these."
4,Where is the Organic Symbol,These chips taste great. I Do Not see a GREEN ORGANIC SYMBOL. Why is it hard to find ORGANIC POTATO CHIPS?
4,Duran does no wrong...,"I've heard that the Wedding Album was the album that really began Duran Duran's comeback (as if they could ever go away), and I can definitely see why. Along with the hits 'Ordinary World' and 'Come Undone', the Wedding Album has a lot of other great songs that have a bit more funk to them than past Duran work. I fell in love with 'Too Much Information' instantly, and it's the perfect opening to the album. 'Love Voodoo' and 'None of the Above' are amazing songs, and I'm sad that they've never gotten onto their greatest hits albums.If you're a Duran Duran fan, this album is a must for any Duran Duran collection. I highly recommend it."
5,Seguso Viro special collection,A great resource book for anyone interestedin Italian glass. Also a good resource bookfor collectors of Seguso glass.
2,Most people should know this stuff,"I already knew most of this information. Then again, I did purchase this item leaving graduate school and when I was in search of my 5 career. There are other girl guides that are much more useful in other subjects, but also inculde a work-related section. I would suggest one of those."
5,"FANTASTIC, BUY IT!","i BOUGHT MY D-50 IN THE SUMMER OF 2006 SHORTLY AFTER IT WAS RELEASED THEN BOUGHT THE BLUE HERON DVD. THAT WAS USELESS. THIS INSTRUCTIONAL DVD TAUGHT ME SO MUCH MORE IN A EASY TO FOLLOW AND UNDERSTANDABLE FORMAT OF HIGHLIGHTING THE CONTROLS THEY WERE DESCRIBING IN THE DISCUSSIONS. I REALLY GOT IT, AFTER I LISTENED TO THIS DVD. IT IS REALLY GREAT FOR THE FIRST TIMERS TO DSLR PHOTOGRAPHY. A GREAT BRUSH UP TO EVERYONE THAT THINKS THEY KNOW HOW TO FUNCTION THIS GREAT CAMERA WILL LEARN SOMETHING SUBSTANCIAL FROM THIS WONDERFULLY FORMATTED DVD. YES, I WILL RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE!"
2,Buyer Beware - don't use this to educate your teenagers about art.,"While the series starts out strong with Caravaggio and Bernini, it slowly heads into disaster with Van Gogh and Picasso. I loved learning about Caravaggio and Bernini and yes, their private lives were shared but not overtly so. Not so with Van Gogh and Picasso. The focus of the art is lost with the jarring vocabulary (yes, the f-word is used at least three times), and the continuous dialogue about the sex lives of these artists. Information I did not need to know to appreciate their art. THIS VIDEO SHOULD BE LABELED EXPLICIT. Everything else is labeled so we are warned, why not this? Because it is art? Call me old fashioned, some things are just better left unsaid. Look for a cleaned up version. Public television did not air Van Gogh (I wonder why). I cringe when I think that after watching Caravaggio and Bernini on Public Television, I sent a copy to my mother not knowing what else was in the series. Thanks Simon!"
5,The best art realted DVD I have ever encountered,"This is smart, deep, elaborate, funny, and as educated as well as entertaining as art related themes can ever get.A real jewel - it will be the prize in anyone's collection.I highly recommend it."
2,2 vacs = 2 filters,"Be careful, this filter fits the older PHV1800 vac but NOT the PHV1810.If you buy the new version of the vac you will need a different filter. Try the PVF110."
2,Bill,"I've owned my Oregon Scientific wireless rain gauge for about four years. I just ordered a La Crosse as a replacement.The OS gauge has been a disappointment from the very beginning. It is somewhat difficult to program and must be reprogrammed each time the batteries are replaced in the receiving unit.As stated by a previous reviewer, the gauge is inaccurate. My typical glass tube type rain gauge always indicates about 25%more rain than the OS.My biggest complaint is battery life. I've lost count of the number of times the batteries have been changed in both the collector and the receiver. The batteries dependably fail during two or three day rain spells requiring me to attend to the tedious job of changing batteries in a downpour or forget about keeping rainfall records.The clock and indoor temperature are accurate."
2,"Surely, there's something better than this","I've had this installed for a little over 2 years. It's a poorly conceived unit. Interested in measuring the rainfall over a year? Good luck as when you have to replace the batteries in the indoor unit, the rain gauge resets. If you have to replace the batteries in the outdoor unit, eventually you'll find the info on pressing the reset button on both units in order for them to communicate again. When you do that - guess what? The rain gauge resets! You'll get a lot more accurate reading, and your measuring equipment will last much longer if you forget this device and buy a nice clear plastic rain gauge and place it where you can see it from indoors. Write down the rainfall every now and then, and in the end you'll be much better off. And - you won't have to replace any batteries. Or, maybe the competition has a unit that works better?"
5,An amazing ...wigglin' dance album!,"Don Juan doesn't know what he's talkin about - this album is great!!! From ""Different Kind of Love Song,"" through ""Music's No Good,"" and ""Rain, Rain"" Cher shares the kind of music she should've recorded in the late 70s - it is a DISCO DREAM! Quite infectious. It brings a nice feeling, too, cuz Cher is singing mostly about universal love. I am very happy with it. I bought it a few days ago and haven't listened to anything else since. If you like ""Believe"" then try this one out."
4,Much better than Believe!!!!!,"I have played Living Proof numerous times! Cher must have had a fun time making this album, because it is such a fun dance album! Song For the Lonely is no contest to the rest of the album! I have played The Music's No Good Without You, Real Love, Rain, Rain, Love is A Lonely Place Without You, Love One Another, and Alive Again countless times. Some of the songs are similar with the rumbling rhythms, but they fit with Cher's style quite well. All the different producers like Barry, Taylor, Stargate, and others provided some very energetic songs for this album! Cher still sounds good today, a strong 40-plus years into her music career!"
