4,Great Game best ever,I recommend this game to nba fans and non nba fans to pick up this great game it has good music its like nba jam with the monster jams.You can even dress up you favorite nba baller or yourself put the jewlery on bling bling u know how it goes PICK THIS GAME UP PLEASE.
5,Hours of FUN!,"My granddaughter has all 3 deluxe magnetic dolls by Melissa and Doug. This one we got her for Christmas. She loves these dress-up dolls! They are easy to take on trips and to the doctor's office. They make great quiet, pre-bedtime play. It's fun to take turns dressing her and surprising each other with a new outfit combination. As with all of Melissa and Doug toys, this one is well-made, colorful, and FUN! Due to some smaller pieces, it's better for 4 yrs. and up unless well-supervised.It's even fun for the adults who get to share it with their children!"
4,Cannot use high capacity memory,"I've had this camera for almost 2 years and am generally pleased with it. I bought an 8 gig HC card for it so I could shoot longer videos, but the camera will not accept it. After trying several times, I tried to contact the Argus company to ask why the card would not format. Of course, I got no response."
5,Love chyna,This book was one of my favorite books about wrestling and it showed how this women has lived through being known as a freak and how she has gotten to place she is know. I think that anyone who even has a clue about wrestling or about chyna you buy this book as quick as you can.
3,Chyna the Queen of the WWF,I thought this book was all right I wish Chyna/Joanie Laurer had written it herself. This book contained information that the wrestling fans would enjoy like pre-wwf wrestling action before she became a huge star. I also liked the Chyna trivia in the back of the book. I would recommend this book to all wrestling fans.
2,Dissapointed,I am a hugh Chyna/Joanie laurer fan all information in this book was compiled from old magazines tv talk shows and her and Hunter's own behind the scence WWF video IT'SOUR TIME. This book did not produce any new information on her life. All it did was skim the surface and use other peoples' work to make this book. I hope the author shares his royalities with all the other writers and talk show host that provided him with their information
5,Exciting Story!,This fasinating story takes you through the exciting carrer of Colonel Ross! From when he first entered the Air Force to Vietnam to Combat Operations! I really enjoyed Colonel Ross' journey and would highly recommend this to anyone looking for adventure!
5,I believe this book is a must.,"I believe this book is a must for those who wish to garner a love of life and learning in their children. I as a homeschool mom have found it a source of comfort and much needed insight in learning to deal with my children who have radically different learning styles. This is a good place to start when embarking on the road to discovering the way another person (child) thinks, learns and perceives their world."
2,Not worth reading unless you're a parent at wits' end,"This book is more for parents than educators, and even then I think it would mostly interest parents dealing with a child having great difficulty, academically or behaviorally. There are a few tips that could enlighten parents and teachers in general, but not enough to buy the book. Along a similar topic, I prefer work discussing the four temperaments by Tim LaHaye, although his books don't focus just on learning as this one does."
5,What an eye-opener!,I purchased this book to help with my son who is 5 and really struggling. I got a very thorough lesson in the learning styles of my older children. I had my children draw pictures of their ideal study conditions and was blessed to be able to fulfil those drawings. The result? Homework done in record time each night with better classwork during the day.
4,Great safe Holster,I had to wait for a longer time to ship this holster but when it arrived I was very delighted.The price paid was great.The holster was just as described and it fit my Browning 45 automatic great.
5,Good dvd,"This was a present, it was a great dvd, great price, fast shipping. Love amazon. I would recommend this dvd."
3,there are 2 diffrent 4 movie sets,the one pictured has 2 track audio on all 4 films the one not pictured has 4 difrent colored picts of pinhead. the 3rd tital is in 5.0 all the rest are in 2.0 2 channel sound .both sets the 3rd tital is widescreen all the same lengths and same titals. Blu Ray is 25 gig capasity so they could have made them all 5.0 the pict quality is the same on both
3,"Broad coverage, but not for the faint-hearted","Written by a University of Chicago professor, this book comprehensively covers times series topics relative to investment and trading-oriented finance (i.e., Wall Street money-making machines). Treatment is generally clear and thorough, but an advanced math and stat background is an absolute prerequisite for understanding the materials.S-Plus/R code is given, but strangely, there is very little on *why* and*when* one uses each of the techniques. Under what cirmcustances should I use or not use GARCH? What exactly is PCA good for in real-world applications? These important questions are not answered, in other words, you don't get a sense of the real-world context for these topics."
2,testament betrayed,"The book itself is good, but the copy sent to us left a lot to be desired, since it had been used in a library."
2,Not for those unaquainted with the Old English language,"This is not the most well-organized Old English Grammar in existence, but it does serve a certain purpose. There is a wealth of information and interesting tid-bits of philological lore, but it is not an introduction to the language by any means (just a warning). Those who do have an understanding of the language would do well to own it, at least for reference purposes, but there are much better and more concise grammars available."
3,"Good, but others are kooler.","In short, this is a great 7 track techno/industrial album, with lots of good samples. But, I would recommend this to the TKK fanatic mostly. As good as it is, I would start another place if looking for your first TKK disc. ""I see good spirits, and I see bad spirits"", and ""Confessions of a knife"" are most like this, and both better overall. After these three albums, TKK go from a darker, to more dancy sound. Though ""Sexplosion"" and ""13 above the night"" are both excellent as well. Whichever TKK cd you choose, including this one, you'll be kooler for it."
3,not bad,but not that good either i mean its fun but the game play is only half as good as nba live 2004 they should stop bringing back old games and come up with better ones
4,THE BEST,This game is hot. This is a f#c&ing good kick a$$ game. You should get this game. Its very cool. You can dunk and all that s@it.
3,Chinese Characters Not Written Clearly,"I bought this book and was disappointed. The grammar lessons and vocabulary are great. But the use of traditional characters (not simplified as used in China (PRC)), and the fact that these are handwritten and small, make it exceptionally hard to learn the characters or understand the exercises. The same book with all simplified characters, and with the characters larger and uniform as in being type set would have been perfect."
5,Best of the best,"I thought that I've bought too many books on Photoshop subject, but I couldn't resist to buy this one only after read the first few pages.Excellent!! a must have books that have improved me alot just in a few weeks. Thanks to Ben."
5,If you wanna learn Photoshop buy this book,"All i have to say about this book that its the best ever ,thanks Ben for wirting this excelent book that made me understand the adobe photoshop , this book gave me the push to understand Photoshop more than the classes that i had on photoshop , again thanks Mr.Ben"
5,Yummy Snack,I throw these in my purse for when I need a small snack to carry me until dinner. They're quite tasty and have a citrus zing to them.
5,Try Them in Cookies or Fruitcake!,"Amazin Raisin is a great tasting alternative to regular raisins. The orange flavoring adds a nice zing to the snack, kind of like dried fruit that you buy to use in fruitcake. (You can taste the flavor, and the raisin).Imagine these in oatmeal cookies or your holiday fruitcake! How about rice pudding? Any place a raisin goes, an Amazin Raisin goes too!"
1,Very confusing book,The recipies gave ranges for liquid and recommended that you check your dough and add more os whatever in order to make the recipe work. Most of my other recipies give exact measurements and I have great success with those. I am hesitant to try any of the recipies in this book for fear of failure. I have a 1-1/2 lb machine.
3,not bad,"I have tried several of the recipes in this book and about half came out good. There are a couple that I really love. I guess my complaint is that many of the recipes are not really for a breadmaker. Alot of the recipes have you prepare the dough in the bread maker but not the cooking part. With a title like Bread machine Magic, I expected the book to be recipes cooked in a breadmaker. So, it was a little disappointing!"
1,Terrible,"One of the worst games I've ever played. Impossible to figure out what to do, hard to understand instructions, and poor design. Buy the original version of NARC on the Midway Classics Collection and you'll probably have more fun."
5,Almost as perfect as it gets...,"As I type this I am listening to this album for probably the thousandth time. It is expertly crafted, and so incredibly intricate and well-executed, that I still crave it, 10 years or so after I first heard it. I can only say that about a few other albums, and they are the Greats, such as The Dark Side of the Moon and the Orb's U.F.Orb. Most of the songs here are completely timeless, and all are fantastic examples of what electronic music can and should be.As for the Skinny Puppy references, I am still a bit of an SP fan (though not nearly as rabid about it, no pun intended) and never drew comparisons between SP and DT. This was a fantastic and refreshing tangent, genuinely crystalline in its precision, and soul, oddly.You absolutely must listen to this with decent headphones at least once before you die."
5,GREAT GAME TO PLAY!,"This game was introduced to me at a class reunion, and it was so much fun until I just had to order one. We got a chance to use it for New Years Day and everyone enjoyed it (even the one's that just listen in). It really helps you to know a bit more about the ones that are in your circle, and even yourself! :)"
3,good for decanting a large amount of wine,"Nice looking item but not as elegant I had expected. Good for decanting wines when drinking w/ a group of people. However, I found it inconvenient to use when I am drinking alone which is most of the time. The base is just too big and it needs a lot of wine to fill up just the base of this decanter."
5,As good as a good batch of Male juice squirted on your back just for kicks!,"This incredible DVD will keep you rollin', jumping on top of lugage and belly laughing throughout its entirety...Whether you enjoy picking up tranny's on the lower east side, or find it thoughtful to swipe your backside while defacating and then spreading the goodness right above your studly boyfriend's upper lip...Lil' Jimmy has all the laughs to keep your tummy tickled while feelin' proud of a man who was once severely hindered by developmental delays due to neo-natal mishaps and the fight to strive against the Down Syndrome battle!And if you enjoy this, you'll enjoy the laughs in BOSTON WITH DAVE ATTELL@ THE ORPHEUM THEATRE, MAY 12...Oops, May 12th - This S#|t D|(k needs to get more bookings!!!RAAAAMMOONN..."
1,"Rocko - Mornings on AM 1740, Mantown's Mulehouse","While searching for material to steal for my new morning gig on AM 1740 ""Mantown's Mulehouse"" in Mantown, ALASKA I saw all the great reviews and picked this DVD up. It was awful man. You people should be ashamed of yourselves for making fun of this poor 'lil Downs Syndrome man in these reviews. Well, back to standing on the AM 1740 billboard to get the ratings up. I will own this town, man."
5,"be my dream, baby","I enjoy this CD very much. It is a collection of DanceHall music, and lyrics which poke fun at puritanical ...... attitudes. It is captivating and entertaining to me because the lyrics are so sardonic, nearly jaded, yet more than anything else, cheeky. The music is also jocular. I especially like the campy, samples of the James Bond theme. SEX ON WHEELZ is the deserved hit, and everything seems to come together but all the songs are great. LEATHERSEX is an effective use of a diva over dance beats, and the bonus track of this song replaces the diva with a swell duet. If you are interested in one of the most controversial albums from (MY LIFE WITH) THRILL KILL KULT, or if you enjoy fun, infectious dance grooves, this CD will interest you."
2,Silly,"I really wanted to like this book and forced myself to finish it, but was very disappointed. I found the diary style distracting, the characters self involved and one dimensional, and the story line extremely silly. Sorry, I see that everyone seems to love these novels, I just don't."
5,Even better than the first one!,"I bought the audio version of this book as soon as I finished the first one ""Bridget Jones's Diary"". It is amazing how Helen Fielding can make the sequel better than the first one (which was great already). Tracie Bennett, again, is a very good narrator. This time someone is trying to destroy her relationship with Mark. Moreover, Bridget is accidently involved in a serious legal trouble. You will love the way she look at her life in the good side in every situations. Although the ending was predictable as usual, the story still kept me laughing all the time.At the end, You (and Bridget)will know (and love) Mark much more."
5,A true pleasure,"In a world of depressing new novels about dead husbands with secret wives, drowned toddlers, raped girls who become obese, psycho twin brothers, mothers dying in child birth...this book (and its predecessor) is as refreshing as spring sunshine after a Canadian winter. Thank you Helen Fielding for your hilarious books. A popular novel doesn't always have to dwell in high drama to be entertaining."
5,VVG!!,"Even better than ""Bridget Jones' Diary""! Loosely based on Jane Austen's ""Persuasion,"" ""The Edge of Reason"" had me laughing out loud in a way that I hadn't in years. Even though I am married (though I hope not smug!), I can relate to Bridget and thoroughly enjoyed her outlook on life.Read ""Persuasion"" first, then reserve a couple of evenings to sit down and enjoy this book."
2,Skip the sequel,"As a fan of the first novel, I was anxious to read Fielding's sequel to Bridget Jones's Diary. I found her follow up very disappointing. While there were a few funny moments that almost every woman could relate to, this installment of her diary was filled with the most insane events. The strength and appeal of the first book was that it Bridget's life seemed to mirror the lives of so many women. However, this book makes one believe that Fielding was desperate for something to give Bridget to do."
5,Wonderfully entertaining,"I had been waiting and waiting for the follow up to BJ's diary. I couldn't wait for the US version so I picked up the book from Amazon.uk. It was worth it. Bridget is as neurotic as ever. Compared to the first book it isn't as good but it is still worth reading and is a lot of fun. I have seen a few reviews, mainly the People Magazine review that panned the book. But that reviewer says just about everything sucks, so buy the book and decide for yourself. True fans of Bridget won't be disappointed."
2,A Reader,"I thought the first book was a little more realistic and you can relate with the characters, well maybe except for Bridget's Mom (A very annoying character). With the second book there were some parts that were laugh out loud but I find myself getting irritated with the characters more often than not. Bridget just became this dumb girl who didn't have any common sense, not knowing what is right and what is wrong; and the part when Bridget and Mark broke up, I didn't feel like there was any valide reason behind it. I'm pretty dissapointed with this book, I had high expectations after reading the first book."
2,I'm sorry but I can't relate to the sequel Bridget.,"Like most of the reviewers, I enjoyed the first Briget Jones's Diary because her insecurities and fumbling we all have been through at one point in our lives. I was really looking forward to the second one but I found this Bridget just awfully stupid! My god, how many times can a person shoot herself in the foot? The interview part with Colin I couldn't even finish because you knew she was going to screw it up. Why must Fielding make Bridget perpetually incompetent? After a while you could telegraph the plot because you knew Bridget was going to make a dumb move. I hate to say it, but she is an borderline idiot with friends who undermine her relationships and self-confidence.I couldn't relate to Bridget in this round, and I yearn for the day when more women writers will make a more complex heroine, whose goal in life is not just about reducing flabby thighs and catching a man before her eggs dry out!"
4,I was Persuaded,"Wasn't sure if I would like this installment as much as the first but I can't deny that I laughed out loud just as much this time. My favorite moment, though, was when I realized that Fielding was doing a gloss on another of my favorite Austen books, Persuasion. Actually I had just watched the wonderful film version on TV the night before I started the book and couldn't miss the parallels (of course if I had paid attention to the reviews I might have realized sooner and picked up the book before it became paperback). Anyway, a truly diverting read. Am looking forward to Helen Fielding's next hilarious book. And of course there's always the much-anticipated movie of Bridget Jones where we can watch poor Bridget embarrass herself over Mark Darcy all over again!"
3,"Entertaining, but not all that","The first installment was funny, quick, and thoughtful. Bridget Jones was an endearing character whose foibles were as lovable as her charms.But Bridget Jones in the follow-up was trite. Poorly developed. Boring. Self-conscious for the sake of being self-conscious. You get the feeling that the publisher rushed Helen Fielding back to the typewriter after the delirious success of the first one...."
2,No more ripping off Jane Austen,"Pure drivel. First book humorous, but this sequel is just derivitive of BJD and Jane Austen's Persuasion. I now don't even like Bridget. Nor do I get Mark Darcy. They certainly do not belong together. Helen Fielding and publishers were just trying to make money-although not from me, since I took this out of the library. I will not even read another Bridget Jones sequel."
5,All Hail Miss Jones!,"In this sequel to ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", Helen Fielding proves there is more fun and laughter in neuroses. Bridge is still obsessing over each stone she puts on, and worrying whether being a ""Singleton"" proves that she will die alone.What's a girl to do when every invite to a party means having to put up with Smug Marrieds? Bridge grabs a glass and leaps in to deal with them all. Her friends Shazzer and Jude are in for the ride too, to provide that special brand of support.Ah, but here her life begins to change: is there a place for her is front of the telly? Who is that young tribesman with her Mum? Does Mark Darcy really mean to leave her for the Asian houseboy? Answering these burning questions is worth the price of the book, alone.It is worth it the debut ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" to get the background on Miss Jones and her gang, but not necessary. For a good laugh, curl up by that winter fire and crack open this book."
3,Bridget Jones; The Edge of Reason,"Amusing and cute, but it did not live up to the first Bridget Jones novel."
3,The Edge of Reason,"This is a silly story about a young adult girl who is desperate to find a man. The plot centers around her ordinary life along with her attempts to become married before she gets too old. Some of her thoughts and interactions are very funny. Not as interesting as Bridget Jones's Diary, however!"
2,v. disappointing,"I really loved the first BJD but this sequel is a BIG disappointment. Very contrived and ho-hummish, the characters totally overdone. Also Bridget gets to be a bit of a whining bore, and so desperate that I found myself not really caring about what happens to her. The book feels like it was all done in a rush. I've just discovered Tiffany Trott which I thought was much, much funnier, and with a kind of whacky innocence and charm. Also Tiffany is really independent, unlike Bridget. But I hope the next Bridget will be better than this one as I used to be a big fan."
4,Bridget is in all of us!,"That is why Helen Fielding's 'Bridget' is so accessible. Because she is our most neurotic selves. Helen Fielding has improved upon the Bridget in the initial installment and made her more realistic. How can you not chuckle at her thoughts surrounding Mark Darcy? (Sidebar: having seen the movie starring Rene Zellweger, the character is more alive). Have we not all been in love but not been sure how the other person really feels and so we go around attributing the wrong motives behind our loved ones actions? Helen/Bridget had me wanting more. Hopefully, she will you, too."
3,Not as Good as Number One,"I've figured out why I didn't like The Edge of Reason as much as I did the first book. Bridget's a lot stupider in number two. In the first book, for whatever her insecurities, Bridget is witty, sharp, and self-aware - whereas, in this book, she seems to mindlessly go from one adventure to another, her motivations trivial. Book II's scenes also move away from the charming friends' pub nights, parents' houses, and Turkey Curry Buffet parties, into Bridget's surrealistic vacations in Thailand. She was likeable in book one because her world was real; now she seems like a figurine.That being said, The Edge of Reason has its moments - though something was definently lost."
5,Easy to install.,Product arrived on-time and works as described.I would recommend this purchase to others.These were substantially more expensive from the dealership. Excellent buy!
2,Too strong,"These fit in our 2006 Jeep Liberty very well but they are too strong for just the glass window. The amount of force that it takes to close the window is too much for that angle. I am 6'2"" and found it very difficult to close the window. After they were installed I had my wife,it is her car, try to close it and she just barely was able to close it. I would not recommend these for the Jeep Liberty."
2,"Shorter than OEM, PSI too strong for Jeep Liberty","While shipping and ordering were fine, the entire gas arm is about an inch shorter than OEM for my 2003 Jeep Liberty so it won't open the rear glass all the way, leaving it still at forehead-cracking level. On top of that, the gas arms are so strong that we are afraid that the glass will crack under the pressure (plus my wife had to use all of her weight to get the glass closed. It scared us so much that we are removing them and going to buy actual OEM from the dealer instead."
2,"Glitz , Glamour Low Low Budget!!!",Be warned this dvd is not what u might think .... Although the box looks Awesome the contents are very different .... This dvd looks to me to have been made with a camcorder and someone running around L.A filming whoever and what ever looks 80s hahah... at one point the camera holds on a Girl .( and im thinkn who is she ? ) no context whats so ever ... Dont buy this if u have already seen A HEADBANGERS JOURNEY because u will be very disappointed... this will go into the back of the collection.
5,Staple for the Season,"Starting with Tramaine kickin' it on O Come All Ye Faithful. It starts my Christmas season to hear her praising in this way. Richard Smallwood, Rickey Grundy, Sandra Crouch, Norman Hutchins all bring solid efforts and I love the arrangement of the Hallelujah Chorus by Pastor Donald Alford & the Progressive Radio Choir. This was the first all gospel Christmas CD/Album I'd ever bought and it delivered - I've never been disappointed. When Tramaine hits those notes - I lift my hands and magnify his name!!! Pick it up today!"
3,"Good, but very high level activities.","I bought this DVD set as a way to find some good theraball exercises for my patients. The workouts start by sitting on the ball and doing some very general core exercises which are a great warm up. But then very quickly it seems to go into very high level core activity which would be very hard for the average patient. I did not like how each DVD started out with the same warm up on the ball, moving hips clockwise/counterclockwise, forward/back, you get the idea. If you plan on personal training or already have a strong core you will love this DVD set. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
4,Fun,"This makes pool time a lot more fun. It is well designed and is as good as new after many many uses. I just wish that it came with more than one ball, or that additional balls could be purchased separately."
3,Some old games does not fit,"Just a part of this collection is as good as my expectation. Since this dvd-rom should contain more than that number of games inside it, I see some drawback of it. I guess SEGA can definitely put more generic games in it."
3,Sweet....Kind of,"When I was fortunate enough to stumble upon this little piece of deliciousness on this very website I just had to have it. The concept of placing some of Genesis' true gems on one disc was phenomenal. However I do have some reservations. First of all I forgot how hard some of these games are. After a few rounds of Altered Beast I wanted to hoist my television into the blood sea istar, however fear of a hernia prevented me from taking these drastic measures. Also i have come to realize that putting all of these games in one package kind of kills the nostalgia, There is alot to be said for the search, the epic quest to find some of these games in there original format. Good luck find decent copies of the Phantasy star games without having to take out a loan. After all of my moaning and griping the bottom line is these are great games, and obviously the price can't be beat."
5,Sega Genesis The Hits!!!!!!!!!,"I love playing these Great Classics over and over again, I have much love for Sega Genesis, I hope there's a part 2."
3,Good read,"This book is actually a few short stories. The first ones are great but the very last one is boring. Overall a great book, though."
5,A wonderful coming of age story (contains a minor spoiler).,"The Jungle Books (parts 1 and 2) are wonderful novels that focus primarily on the exploits, adventures, and maturation of an orphaned boy named Mowgli. Mowgli is raised in the jungle by the animals and is educated in the laws and ways of the various jungle dwellers. Loyalty, trust, honor, honesty, and courage are but a few of the values championed in these books. The Jungle Books also remind us that childhood doesn't last forever, and eventually we all must leave it behind to assume greater responsibility in the world. As Kaa the Python said in the book ""Having cast the skin, we may not creep into it afresh."" These novels are pure magic."
5,This book is really cool!,"I really enjoyed this one, I loved the Mowgli stories, (i see now much they Kidized them for the disney movie now,) and I especially loved re-reading Rikki-Tikki-Tavi."
5,Mowgli,This is a classic that I discovered quite by accident in my old age. I bought a copy of The Tiger's Wife at the airport and one thing led to another-----I am now a huge of fan of Jungle Book and plan to read it several more times.
1,Not worth the effort,"kipling is great of course, but part of the story is missing, the chapters run together, and there is no table of contents"
3,small print for a young reader,the print was some what small for a young reader-----I but the child will grow into it I am sure
2,try the first 4 albums..........,"this songwriting is Sh**. *Not as vicious sounding as with the hoffman brothers. *that gave deicide there original vicious hate-nurished sound. Glen Benton Can't do the high pitched demon shrieks anymore...That is all, some of Owens and Ralphy's work takes skill to do, but the song writing is not up to par of what deicide was."
2,Buy Conair Spiral curling iron instead,"I purchased this one when my Conair spiral curling iron broke after 4 years. This Revlon curling iron does not get near as hot as the Conair and does not achieve near the curls as the Conair as the result. Don't waste your money on this one, buy Conair Spiral curling iron instead! :)"
3,OK for what it is...,"If you have several hours to work on your hair to get those perfect pin curls, then this works. but if you have very little time and already have thick hair then you will have to take several passes at the same bunch of hair to get them to stay. It would work even better if i was ambidextrous..."
5,Pirates of the Boardroom,"In Irving Abraham's engrossing page-turner, a Philadelphia lawyer with a heart of gold and his salty crew of 18th century Americans administer well-deserved thrashings of the literal and figurative sort to ye scurvy present-day plundering Pirates of the Boardroom and other modern miscreants. You'll buy it for the Philly-centric insights into the way our forefathers lived (and sailed), and you'll keep reading it for the engaging story of honorable men and women playing hardball - by the rules. Skirting the shoals of cynicism, and occasionally succumbing to the siren song of stereotyping, Abraham reminds us that there was once a time when corporations and their employees were in it for the long haul, for better or for worse, and a paycheck wasn't merely a C-note left on the night table. Budding bean-counters and tycoons-in-training would be well-advised to read it."
3,A good attempt but falls a little short.,"I konw a lot of people say that this game plain out sucks. That's not true. This game makes a great attempt to make a arcade soccer game. The plus sides to this game is pretty good graphics, and great environments. You can even pick up items and throw them at the other team mates like chairs. You can punch and kick people down and it's pretty fun. The gameplay is where the game falls a little short. It has quite a few errors that need to be fixed like the controls and stuff. But for this being one of the first arcade soccer games i give it a lot of credit. You will have quite a bit of gameplay out of this and it's fun with multiple people. The most I would pay for this game is 15 to 20 dollars. If you like soccer and you want to bend the rules a little get this game but if you like realistic soccer or don't like it all stay clear."
3,My first taste of Sparks,"Long ago, when I was about 11 or so, my brother mentioned Sparks ""curious"" music. A couple of years later I picked up the LP version of this CD and it quickly became the record that stayed on the turntable. Sparks are so removed from mainstream in arrangement, use of instruments, and incredibly clever lyrics and titles that the novice might view them as a sideshow act. But they're the real deal. I like to think it's about social commentary but I probably shouldn't take it too seriously."
4,A useful resource...,"Linda Bowman, author of the FREE Stuff and Good Deals series of books, has cobbled together a fine resource for seniors in this book.The book is chiefly a reference work. It is loaded with information on low-cost entertainment, active lifestyle ideas, travel resources (the section I enjoyed most), financial and legal tips, senior learning tools, and health related information. Some of the resources and sites that she referred to will be added at ElderHope.com! FREE Stuff is a book of references and ideas and, as such, should serve you well."
5,Listening to it over and over...,"As a musician, I am impressed with the quality of the performance on this CD, as well as the excellent texts adapted to ancient Celtic melodies. The CD contains a good mix of musical styles. Among my favorite familiar tunes are ""O For A Thousand Tongues"", ""Be Thou My Vision"", and ""St. Patrick's Breastplate"", but there are also songs that are refreshingly new to me. Loved every minute of it and play it often."
2,HAHAHAHAHA WHAT A JOKE!,Da Band is HORRIBLE!!! this cd is HORRIBLE!!! i give this cd 2 stars for the the only 2 people in the group that have potential which are Ness and Dylan...Chopper sounds like a fuddup Lil' Wayne only uglier...Miami's (or Frederick whatever) voice is a bite off of Pastor Troy only half as hard...Babs is Lil Kim on crack...Sara is trying to be like ashanti but can't sing as good OR look as good...I'm really dissapointed w/ diddy on this one...i think that the only reason why people act like they like them is because of the bad boy logo on the back of the cd...not to mention they are arrogant as a mofo... i don't see this group going far...save your money...i traded my cd in for $2 which is what they are really worth...
1,Underground? Yah fo' sure....;),"What I hate in this group is that they're are possing like there are underground, and they you buy cd and you see, that this is another unoriginal creation. There's really nothing new here, even the songs are not too catchy. Stay away!"
5,ITS THE D-A-B-A-N-D,DA HOTTSET ALBUM BY A RAP GROUP. NESS TORE UP DIS CD. FREDRICK IS A RAPPIN CUTIE WIT LOTS OF TALENT. MY GIRL SARA STOKES TORE UP DOES VOCALS. BABS-BUNNY/DYLAN GREAT DUO. CHOPPA IS DA BOMB. MY LIFE IS FULL OF HIP-HOP DRAMA.LIVIN LEGENDS IS SO HOT. TONIGHT BEST SONG ON DA ALBUM.BUT MY FAVORITE SONG ON DA CD IS GO STEADY. ITS LIKE A GANGSTA R&B SONG SARA AND NESS MAKE DA BAND DA BOMB. NOW THE ONLY QUESTION I GOT IS WHENS DA BANDS NEXT ALBUM.
4,This CD is hot & hata proof!!,"This is a lil' note to ""Michael Gross"" and all utha hataz.... For one , G, dont be hatin on my cousin Babs and whoever read them reviews... dont listen! i'm tellin u tha album is hot! Don't just listen to a sample, listen to tha whole album straight through! Then u will hear tha realness and creative side of them! The album is not fake AT ALL! It's all real! Its the truth! The best songs are... ""Tonight"" ""My Life"" ""Why?"" ""Go Steady"" and ""How you like me now""<<(my favorite)(HOT azz beat) Go get the album, fa sho!!!!!!"
3,Room For Improvement,"First of all, I didn't buy the CD yet, but I downloaded a couple of songs and found two big problems. Dylan probably has the most potential to be a solo star, but he's only on about 3 or 4 songs, while Ness who's got the whackest flow in America is on almost every song. People are saying that Young City's lyrics are garbage, but at least he's not mumbling his lyrics like E. Ness, who apparently thinks he's the hottest M.C. in the world. Overall, I think the group has potential but they suffer from a whole lot of Ness, almost no Dylan, mediocre lyrics, and contradicting styles."
2,not that good,"this cd is no where near as good as i expected. upon buying it, i was aware that there would be a couple rnb songs b/c of the one girl, but there all almost NO upbeat songs. for all the good rappers in da band, they have no tight beats to showoff on. the only good songs are ""bad boy this bad boy that"" ""why"" and ""tonight"" if u like beats and good rapping, this cd is not for you."
2,Too un-talentive for T.V.,"This band is finish for good. P.Diddy broke up te band forever. It all started with Dylan not showing up at a party at Diddys place so he kick him out. Then Fred decided to quit the band all together. Then Diddy kick two other people out the ones that he had trouble with in the past they are Sara and Chopper. He decided to keep Ness and Babs to work with them.I'm so glad they broke up cause they never got alone with each other anyway. I felt sorry for Sara she was the only singer in the group and the only one married with kids. I never did like their name group ""Da Band"" come on name it something original. Most of the group was ugly except Sara she was the dvia. As far as their music it just was boring even their music video were they were playing baseball then they start fighting the other team players.This is funny P.Diddy said, American Idol is a joke but after seeing his show now you see whats really a joke."
3,"Better then I thought, RAW","Babes, is going to be, not yet, but going to be one of the top female contenders. She is for real, what you see and hear from her is real. I am sorry but i am not a big Sara fan, if you have seen the show the other girl sounded better, but the male r&b singer would have made this band HOT. Babes is the only lady that needs to be a part of this band. I love Freds voice, and Chopper is the pure energy of the group. Ness is so talented he is the best rapper/hip hop artist of the groupI am sorry but i love reggae/dancehall music and Dylan needs to quit. I seriously think the band should consist of Babes, Fred, Chopper and Ness, that's it. Sarah will do her own thing she is a great person she just doesnt need to be a part of this band. And i just don't have the tolerance for Dylan and his laziness and that sound is so way off. Puffy really?"
5,Great read!,"This book was a heart wrenching read. I could identify and feel for the characters. This is one find that all lesbians should have on their shelves, and that all people alike should read. The only complaint I have is that at times it seems like the main character is a little emotionless in her writing. Other than that, I would highly recommend this book."
4,great...,Arrived in time n undamaged. Came in time. Was a little smaller than I thought but that's my own fault... lol
4,Image quality excellent/Problems with analog,"Just a couple of quick comments.Unlike one of the other reviewers I have had no problem with ""home burned"" dvds (dvd-r on a pioneer burner using Ulead). So based on my experience I wouldn't worry about it.However, by the admission of their helpful tech support, they really aren't interested in supporting rca analog out, so the fact that the signal is too dark is both known to them, and something they won't be fixing. Fortunately, I have equipment to compensate for this problem, but you might not.I did have a peculiar occasional problem which they both were able to diagnose and tell me how to resolve.But even in analog the image quality is excellent, and I have decided to keep the deck."
4,Good Player but have problem with TV audio,"I bought this and had it for one day. I must say the picture quality is excellent. I have a Panasonic 56"" DLP projection TV 56DLX76, the DVD output covers up the entire screen with good color and sharpness. I have problem with the audio coming out of the TV. I hooked it up using the DVI-to-HDMI cable provided to connect to the TV then use the left/right analog cable for the audio. The dialogue gets drowned out by the music while watching a movie. I tried different movie and adjusted the TV but still hard to hear the dialgue. It could be my TV or because of the analog audio to the TV. I haven't try connecting it to my receiver via the optical out but I am sure it will do fine. I am returning this DVD and getting Philips DVP5960/37 for similar picture performance, better sound quality and less expensive. In all fairness, I think Oppo is a very good upconvert DVD player. I just wish it has worked out with the audio and the prices should down a bit."
2,"! WARNING TO PLASMA TV OWNERS! Black border is a MAJOR ISSUE, AS IT WILL CAUSE PERMANENT SCREEN BURN IN","!WARNING TO PLASMA TV OWNERS! There is a MAJOR issue that the picture has a black border around it, regardless of what resolution it outputs on DVI. Picture does not completely fill in screen. This issue is not minor (somebody wrote minor before) as IT WILL PERMANENTLY BURN IN THE SCREEN IF YOU HAVE A PLASMA TV. For this reason, I give it only 2 stars until they fix this problem through firmware upgrade. If they in fact can fix this, I would give it a 5 star rating. DO NOT BUY THIS NOW IF YOU OWN A PLASMA TV UNTIL THE BLACK BORDER ON DVI IS FIXED."
1,Oppo doesn't care about deaf/hard-of-hearing people,"I wrote to Oppo before ordering to make sure that this player would support closed captioning. Oppo's response, although it arrived within hours, was that due to ""an oversight"", the player doesn't support closed captioning.It's a shame; I've seen good reviews of this DVD player.I will be purchasing from another manufacturer that does recognize that disabled customers have needs that need to be met, and that there is profit in catering to them. Shipping a device that doesn't provide closed captions in this day and age is just unacceptable -- especially in a product that does have the ability to update its own firmware.Furthermore, I will also be letting others in the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities that I am part of know that Oppo doesn't consider the needs of the disabled to be important in its product design, and will be recommending its competitors."
4,"Excellent player, but not fully coocked software","Very good quality DVD player. Gives me nice quality picture on my 61"" samsung DLP TV, especially cartoons movies. But have some minor problems with randomly squarish pickcelation on the screen ones in a while. Ones I had a picture going and the sound started like 2 sec later. After I reinstalled dvd, it was ok thereafter. This all happened when I was watching DivX coded movies, so may be a genuine DvD-video has no problems. Conclution is that I probably need to upgrade the chip software for decoding the signals, otherwise I would give this player 5*.p.s. I wish I coud have 1080P upscaling instead of 1080i. The pisture would be more clear. By the way if you have a video in DivX format but in high definition resolution, or even any resolution above standart TV uses, it won't play."
4,Love this dvd player,"This also comes with all the cables you need for the HDMI hook up .......... Wish the 'Zoom' zoomed in more, but it is well worth the money."
1,high hopes not quite fulfilled,"I had purchased a Samsung 46"" DLP television in mid december. I chose the OPPO to play on it and it did not work like I had hoped. Essentially, areas of flat colors, specifically dark flats, became heavily pixilated. I am not sure if my particular player was defective or if it was a problem with the DVI/HDMI interface. Ultimately, I purchased a Sony hooked up with component cables and it works pretty well. Also, I am not sure if this particular to my television set but the HDMI hook-up always leaves colors seeming a bit washed out."
1,"After owning it for 4years, I recently dumped it for a Denon.","I owned this Player for 4years and all along misled into thinking I had something better than sliced bread. Was I wrong!First, the Macro blocking issue, the display displays blacks horrendously. All other colors are good, but the blacks and the smudging is way too irritating. All along I thought it was my plasma TV that was the problem. Now, ater switching to a Denon 1940CI which by the way also uses the same Faroudja processing.. I dont see the Macro blocking issue anymore and the audio is much better than the Oppo's. I would give the Denon 1940CI 5 stars and the Oppo 971H 1 star. The Oppo is all hype and hot air"
2,Good while it lasted.,It appeared to be a good player however it started malfunctioning after 1 year and by the end of the second year no longer worked.
3,Wish it would perform HDTV upconversion on Component Output,"I love it's performance EXCEPT that it doesn't output HDTV resolutions through the component video interface. My TV only has component inputs so this is a big problem for me. Beware, though this may have to do with copy protection compliance or something. Other manufacturers may have the same problem... We're kind of in the dark ages in video world where copy protection trumps functionality every time."
2,Sago Palm Cycas Revoluta Pet Warning,"While this plant is beautiful, it also has a dark side. They are very poisonous for dogs and cats. I would recommend buying a dog/cat ultrasonic repeller from Amazon. Placement of the repeller will keep dogs and cats safe from being poisoned.Other than that, these are beautiful plants! I would recommend these for those people not having pets or young children. They will do well inside homes with southern exposure windows."
4,japanese sago palm,"I order this item think it will be getting a small plant.I received a very healthy palm, big & beutiful. I love my sago."
2,It doesn't work on my dog!,"Perhaps other people are satisfied with this, but my dog seems to get sick when I administer it! So I guess that I will not order it again!"
5,wow I was impressed,"this product really works. I am happy that I found it, made a difference in as little as 2 days. I would recommend this product"
5,Three cheers for Angel Eyes,"Angel Eyes is one product that lives up to expectations. It is worth every penny of its rather hefty price. Angel Eyes does not stop tearing, but what it does do is stop the tears from staining the face. I have a white Miniature Poodle that competes in Agility. By using Angel Eyes, his striking handsome face is stain free! Thank you Angel Eyes!"
5,Best stuff around!!,"I first bought this at a Doggie Boutique for my Shih Tzu, she had a horrible odor from her eyes and bathing didn't help it just came right back. The groomers there recommended it. After using it for a few days the smell was gone. Now I stock up on the big bottle because you still have to use it a couple times a week to keep the smell away. My friends use it on their Maltese because it keeps her eye area nice and white instead of that brownish color."
5,TEAR STAINS -- BYE BYE,"I have five Maltease dogs who had a horrible problem with tear staining. Nothing I did seem to help and it was getting out of control!!! I heard about Angels Eyes my granddaughter-in-law who also has a Maltease, however her ""Jake"" has the most handsome face -- NO TEAR STAINS!! I decided to give it a try and IT WORKS!!! I was giving it to them on their food everyday (and they love it) but now I just use it once every other week or so. Now I have beautiful female Maltease dogs. I HIGHLY recommend ANGEL EYES TEAR STAIN REMOVER!!!"
3,Still too early to tell,"I bought this for two of my dogs. One is a Yorkie mix and the other is a Chihuahua mix and they both have problems with tearing eyes. They have only been on it a little over a month. I have seen big improvement in my Yorkie mix but only a little improvement on my Chihuahua mix. I have been following the instructions according to the bottle, however I think my Chihuahua might need a little more than the recommended amount so I might try this to see if it helps. It might just be that it's going to take a little longer to work with her. But so far, so good and there have been no side effects either, which is a good thing. After they have been using it a little longer I will update my review and let everyone know how things are progressing.Angels' Eyes Tear-Stain Eliminator for Dogs, 120-Gram Bottle"
5,Amazing Results!,"I can't believe the results we got with this product. We have a Maltese whose sweet white face was ALWAYS stained very badly. Her face was constantly wet, with dark, dark brown stains. I tried EVERYTHING. We constantly washed her face, changed her food to try to eliminate anything that could be causing the problem there, kept her away from anything that could irritate her eyes. But no matter what we did she was still a mess! Then we tried Angel Eyes and voila! White face. Beautiful dry, white face. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I would never have believed it. If you're debating whether to buy this product or not - stop it! Just buy the stuff! It works!!!"
1,Angel Eyes,"My dog wouldn't touch food that had the Angel Eyes sprinkled on it, despite trying to disguise it in even his favorite food. A waste of money as I will never learn if Angel Eyes really does want it claims."
1,"Be careful, it's an antibiotic","I purchased this product but waited to ask the vet before opening it. He told me that this is an antibiotic and that is why is so effective, but he told me that there is no creature that can live with an antibiotic for ever... That the stains are not a health problem, is beauty stuff... so he accepts its use for show dogs (just a little while before each presentation) but not on a daily basis for a pet...so, I returned it.Please, check this with your own vet."
4,Angels' Eyes Tear Stain Eliminator for Dogs,Love the product......my JJ's eyes have no tear-stains and he looks as cute as ever !!!!!!!!!
2,No big deal,"I started using this product 1 month ago on my Maltese following the product instruction. So far, I cannot see the difference on my dog's tear stain. When I exhausted my supply, I will not buy another bottle again."
4,Great product!,"This is amazing stuff. I have never had a dog with a tear stain problem before and the groomers I spoke to said there was nothing to be done for it. Angels Eyes works. She doesn't care for the taste so I have to disguise it with something tasty, but I put half the dose in each meal and it goes down OK."
1,angel eyes for dogs 30 gram bottle,This is a waste of money. We have been giving it to our maltese every morning in her food for a month now and it has not done anything for her tear stains. The only active ingredient is 100% beef liver and beef liver does not remove or prevent tear stains. Save your money.
5,Angel Eyes,"The product was sent promptly, & packaged in a excellent manner. I was so happy to find a very fair price.I will definetly order from again"
5,Great!,"It takes a while to work, but then you put less in the food. It's working great!It's natural and doesn't affect the taste of the food."
5,Miracle Powder,I have been using Angel Eyes for about 2 months now and I am amazed at the difference. I have a 1 1/2 year old Maltese who has problems with his eyes and we have tried many products to no avail. My vet mentioned this product and we have had no red staining since. It only took about 2 weeks to start noticing a difference and each time he is groomed we lose more and more of the previous staining. I can't wait until he is completely clear. He still tears but they are no longer red. This is not the cheapest product but if you want WHITE you will get it!
5,Awesome!,I have an eight-month-old shih tzu who had reddish tear stains -- Angel Eyes cleared them up quickly. I add a little water to the powder and pour that over my pup's food. I would recommend this product!
5,Great Product!!!!,"I have a maltese and he gets tear stains really bad. I have used this product in the past and had ran out of it,so I decided to try amazon to see if they had better prices than other sites. I got the same product from them at a better rate than I would have if I would have ordered it from other pet supply sites. It's works really great if you have a pet that gets tear stains."
5,Angel Eyes - Love it!,Great results. I have a beautiful Tri-Colored Corgi who had a lot of eye staining. I saw improvement within one week and great improvement in about 3 weeks.My dog adapted immediately to the taste. Did not appear to notice any difference with her food.Will continue to use. Happy customer!
4,Angels Eyes Works!,Angels Eyes really works with getting rid of the staining but I have a hard time getting my Toy Poodle to eat the food with it on. He obviously doesn't care for the taste so I have to put only a little on the canned food at a time and put lunch meat pieces in the food to get him to eat it. I find that if I mix it really well in the foods gravy he will eat it. The staining has really improved since I started feeding it to my dog. Next time I purchase it I am going to try the meat flavored to see if he likes it better than the regular flavor.
2,needs nutritional analysis,Given the main ingredient is liver this manufacturer should provide an estimate of the amount of vitamin A in each serving.
3,angel eyes,"It worked for quite a while and even though I was still giving it to our dog , her eyes got bad again"
4,Works Great!,No more of the ugly brown tears on my little dog! I just sprinkle it on his food (I use a salt shaker)and he looks great!
3,"works great, but not good for long term use","i used this product and it does work. though after discussing with my vet, he doesn't recommend it due to the antibiotic in it. with the antibiotic resistance today and with long term antibiotic use, it could lead to antibiotics being ineffective later in life if your dog needs them. i am not sure i want to take that chance. i ma surprised that the company doesn't put a warning label on their product."
5,Angel Eyes - AMAZING!,"I live in Vancouver BC and purchased the small container of this for $30 CDN (what a ripoff), then I found this amazing deal and now my adorable little poodle is tear free and looking like a superstar!! Thank you for providing this great product, in such amazing quanitity at an excellent price!! I highly recommend this product to anyone dealing with doggie tears, after all dogs should never cry and only smile :)"
5,works as promised!,My Yorkshire Terrier has a problem with brown smelly tear stains on his eyes that is difficult to remove and really makes it difficult to clean. I have used one bottle and am opening the 2nd. I didn't use as much as they want you to but it worked fabulously. It is difficult to get the dog to eat it but found if I put it in a spoon of soft dog food he takes it without problem. In about 3 wks the tearing has almost completely stopped and the odor is gone. It's not advertised as a bad breath cure but we have noticed his terrible breath is no longer offensive. I love this product and highly recommend it to everyone with a dog having these problems.
2,Does not work,Does not appear to be working as his stains are quite dominant. I even clean his eyes every night with pads secifically for this. Any advice. Do dogs become immune to it? I've been using it fir three years.
1,"Works, but all it is is overpriced powdered beef liver...","This product does work on most dogs. However, just look at the ingredients list. All it is is powdered liver. The mark up on this stuff is criminal. 240 Grams of Angel Eyes is over fifty dollars, but you can get 12 oz (340 grams) of powdered beef liver, which IS THE EXACT SAME THING, for about twelve dollarsNow Foods Liver Powder, 12-Ounce"
1,Stopped Working,"When I first purchased this, I saw an improvement in my dog's eyes, but after a few months, it stopped working."
5,Angels' Eyes worked well for my dog,"My coton de tulear developed horrible tear staining when he was about 5 months old. I purchased Angels' Eyes and within a month my puppy's stains were completely gone. My pup is now 10 months old and remains completely tear stain free. One suggestion- follow the dosing and frequency directions on the bottle! At first you will have to give it every day, but over time you can reduce to 2-3 times per week and keep the results."
2,Disappointing...,"I have tried everything to help with the tear stains for my white poodle. So I was anxious to try this after seeing all the reviews. I have completed one 120 gm bottle and there has not been any change in the staining. In addition, my pup HATED the taste of the beef flavor. He has eaten dry food for all his life, but the only way I could get him to eat this was to mix his dry food with a little bit of water. Now that I have finished the bottle and he doesn't want to eat his normal dry food, I have to add a water in it.So in the long run....a big set back for our household."
5,Best Stuff for my Maltese Lily!,"This product really works on my maltese Lily VERY well!! I didn't use it for about a week while it was still packed in my luggage and I noticed immediately the brown junk that started forming under her eyes without it. I use just a little everyday (she only weighs 3lbs!) so my first 120oz bottle has lasted me over a year, and it works like a charm!"
4,This really does work.,"When I got my maltese he already had some tear staining. As a few months went by the stains became much worse. It made him look terrible. I tried every over the counter drop, wash, wipe, etc. that I could find and nothing worked. I also tried several things prescribed by my vet. Angel eyes works like magic. Within a few weeks the stains were completely gone. I have to sprinkle the powder on a small slice of turkey or ham and roll in up to get him to eat it. He looks forward to his treat every morning. I have followed the directions and tried to gradually take him off of it, but the stains start to come back right away. I am going to contact Angel Eyes to make sure it's ok for him to stay on it. I highly recommend Angel Eyes!"
5,This stuff works,We have a Toy Poodle and we no longer have to wipe his tears at night. Angel Eyes does the trick.
4,Finally got my dog to take his Angel Eyes,"I have a white poodle that needed Angel Eyes for the staining under his eyes. What a difference - it really works! We have used it for a little over a year now and my only problem with Angel Eyes has been....how to get him to take it? So I started putting Angel Eyes in a minimum amount of can dog food, but eventually nothing worked. The staining under his eyes came back with a vengeance - probably because we we're not use to seeing him like that. Couple of months ago, I got the brainy idea of getting a capsule filler (from Amazon of course) and of putting Angel Eyes in a blank capsule (I choose size 0) a couple of times a day I put 1 in a Pill Pocket. It works - finally! I give them to him every day because of the dosage but we are now down to 2 capsules a day."
5,Tear stains gone!,I have a white maltese that had the brown tear stain. The vet and groomer recommended Angel Eyes. It takes just a few weeks before you see a improvement. Now her face is white and no tear stain.
5,Angel Eyes,We have used Angel Eyes for the past year. When we started our Golden Retriever had dark brown stains running down from each eye. In a short time we were able to reduce usage to every other day. The lines have completely disappeared.
5,No more tear stains,"I started using Angel Eyes about 2 weeks ago and my Westie's eyes are not staining at all! I love it, she looks so pretty now. This stuff really works. She and my other Westie, who doesn't need it, both love the taste. I sprinkle it on the food, put warm water in and mix it."
2,Dog won't Eat Food,I can't tell if this product works or not because my dog won't eat her food when I add it.
2,its ok,"i have 2 maltese, this stuff works, but if i had only 1 dog to use it, it will cost me a fortune still, you have to put a lot in their found to get it going and still more"
1,angel eyes,"Angels' Eyes Tear-Stain Eliminator for Dogs and Cats, 120-Gram BottleThis product is unsafe.The vet has told us to never use this product,it will block the tear ducts and would need to have to pay for an operation to open the ducts"
1,You can get this for alot less money.,"If you bought beef liver treats and crushed them up, you would have this product. It is not healthy to give too much of this to your dog. Search for freeze dried beef liver treats for dogs. Any pet store will have them as well. You will pay a fraction of the price for many times more actual product."
1,Angel Eyes,"My maltese did not like it and this actually was not the product I thought it was when I ordered it, so I pitched it."
5,my bichon looks so handsome now!,"I've been putting this powder on my bichon frise's food for a few months now, skipping a few days here and there, and really only a little bit of powder (since it's so expensive), and it's made a HUGE difference in his appearance! I am very, very pleased with this product, it really does work and his face is now almost completely white. No more ugly brown stains all over his beard! I think he's not tearing as much, or at least it's just not noticeable anymore. Others have noticed the change too. Don't hesitate to try this, it's worth it."
1,how to use when you have two dogs,"Could someone come up with a suggestion for using this product on two dogs? They both use the same bowl, so using 1/2 teaspoon per day per dog is kind of hard if not impossible to do. Even if it was one dog....they only eat a little each day. How do I know I am not bombarding them with this tear stain product cummalitively. It would be great if they just came up with a pill formula for Angel Eyes product. The reason for my no star review? I am still figuring out to give this 1/2 teaspoon per day to my two maltese.Sincerely,Barbara O'Brien"
4,Angel's Eyes,"product performs as described. My dog's red fur stains around the eyes and mouth began to disappear in 7-10 days and were mostly gone by the end of the month. An MD friend of mine expressed some concern about giving the dog such high doses of liver extract, but I did not see any negative effects in the dog's well-being. I have my dog on a maintenance schedule now at a half dose weekly."
4,Reviews of Angel Eyes..,I have had some great success with using angel eyes for my Bichon Frise. It clears of the tear stains quickly. One issue that I have is that with the beef flavoring my little girl doesn't care too much for the flavor. So in my case I have to mix it with something like non-flavored yogurt or something else to have her eat it. If I put it on her food she doesn't eat too much. I am going to have to try a different flavor. But overall I love the product and strongly suggest it to anyone who is trying to get rid of those pesky tear stains...
3,hhhmmm,"I just got my shipment of Angel Eyes from Amazon, the 120 grm bottle was sealed. (I read that was an issue for some) My dog would not eat it!, I read in one of the reviews that they put some cheese in it and now the dog eats it no problem, I only feed my dog dry food so I will try this method..Excited to see if it works..wondering though, I have chicken flavor, does it come in a beef flavor?"
5,Best Product For Tear-Stained Eyes Ever!!!,"This is the best product for eliminating eye stains! and I've tried many. It's also the easiest. Just add to the dogs' food. I started seeing results within the very 1st week! It may seem pricey, but it is definitely worth it! I love this product and so will your dog!!!"
2,Ehh...didnt work for my white shiz-tu,"The directions say this stuff can be added to water, and when its added, it looks like muddy dirty water, and my dogs would NOT drink it unless they were thirsting to death. It settled toward the bottom of their water bowl, and left a yucky film.I tried it, and didnt see any change...stains still there on my white shiz-tu's face. I read the ingredients, seems that its ground, dried liver. That's all. That's it. Well blow me away, I can buy chicken liver and feed that to my dog, and get the same effect for a lot less money. LOL I really had high hopes for this product based on the rave reviews, but it just did not work for my dig."
3,ANGEL EYES,I expected more from this product.It did help.I would recommend it to someone else if they can't find a better product.Philip Starks
1,"Angels' Eyes works, but I think it may endanger your dog's health","I have been giving my 16 month old blonde Havanese Angels' Eyes for a few months. It did a great job in clearing up her tear staining. However recently she developed Pancreatitis. I don't know if Angel Eyes' had anything to do with it for sure or not. But Angel Eyes' contains an antibiotic (tylosin). My dog is now recovering and should be ok. But I thought about. Would you give your child a daily dose of antibiotics? It can irritate the digestive tract. Also after awhile, you dog develops a tolerance for antibiotics. What if your dog develops pneumonia etc. ?, and the you find out that antibiotics no long work for him because his body has built an immune system against antibiotics ? I know that the UK and some other countries have banned products with tylosin in them. I am now researching an alternative to Angels' Eyes. I will never use Angels' Eyes again."
2,ANGELS' EYES,"I purchased the 240 gr. bottle. BIG MISTAKE....My dogs will not touch this product. I have mixed it with dog food, chicken, steak, hamburger, rice, noodles, cheese and in their water.(using 1/8 tsp) One smell and they walked away...so I don't know if this product really works. Total waste of money for me. If I had it to do over, I would buy the smallest amount available, then throw away. I wouldn't have lost so much money. Wish they offered refund if dog's wouldn't try product..."
4,Angels Eyes really works,My little 5 lb. Maltese looks so angelic except for his stained face. It is now starting to grow in white again which will allow him to show how truly beautiful he is again. I've tried a lot of different products but this is the only one that works. Thank you Angels Eyes!
5,working well,"We have used this for about 6 weeks and all tear stains are almost completely gone. Our dog liked it at first in his water but now will only take it sprinkled on his food. Overall, this works better for tear stains than any product we have tried"
2,Might have helped... Probably not,"At the same time we started using this we also switched from plastic to stainless steel food and water dishes and began to wash them before each meal. The tear stains cleared up.Then we got a bit lazy and stopped using Angel's Eyes but continued to wash the stainless steel dishes frequently. The tear stains didn't come back.My suggestion is to change in ""dishware"" first and see if you can do without this stuff."
4,Angel Eyes,"Angel Eyes is very easy to use. While my Maltese's eyes haven't cleared up completely, they are far better than they have been with any other product I have tried."
4,It Works!,"May daughter used Angel's Eyes on her Tibetan Spaniel and her Bishon Frise with great results in just a few weeks. My little Shih Tzus did not have a big problem. We just had to wash her face and eyes twice a day - no problem. My mother tried it on her light cinnamon colored toy poodle and saw drastic improvement in only two weeks. Okay, I thought I would try it. My full beige coat Shih Tzu only needs her face washed a couple times a week and it is not because of stuff in her eyes. I noticed an improvement in only 3 days. GOOD STUFF!"
4,Angels eyes,"My dog has been taking this for about 2 weeks now, and there is a big change in her stains. The problem is, she doesnt like the taste. I mix it with whipped cream from a can, and she eats it right up! We have tried prime rib, dog food, steak, ice cream, meatballs, but the whipped cream works the best."
5,It really works!,"My schnauzer had dark brownish-red stains around his mouth where the hair was supposed to be white.He began licking his legs and feet, so they also turned an ugly brownish-red. I tried different shampoos and changed his food but nothing worked until I tried Angel Eyes. It wasn't overnight. It took maybe 2 to 3 months. As the stains grew out and his hair was trimmed, it became obvious that the red yeast was stopped and the hair again became beautiful, snowy white like it it should be! He looks wonderful and healthy again instead of dirty. Thanks so much."
4,My 2 cents,"We live with a 7 year old Maltese that has a genetic deficency of ""crummy eyes"" .They get crusty and dirty looking and Angels' Eyes (make sure you spell correctly or you get to some porn site) seem to help ease up on the crusty dirty looking problem. ""Try it you'll like it!"""
4,Angels Eyes works!!!,We have a sweet little white maltipoo. Angels Eyes has done a really good job of clearing up those stains under her eyes. We will continue to use this product. It works!
3,"This product works, but . . .","I have been using Angels' Eyes on a white Bichon Frise and it really does work to get rid of eye stains found on so many white dogs. The second ingredient is listed as ""Tylosin as tartrate"". I recently found out Tylosin is an antibiotic. I'm not sure I want my dog on a low dose antibiotic just to get rid of eye stains. If you don't mind low doses of antibiotics it is a great product. I just wish I had known that Angels' Eyes contained an antibiotic, before I ordered it."
1,not too pleased,"I'm on my second bottle of Angel's Eyes and truthfully have not seen the great results that others boast. My Bichon has large stains below both eyes after 3 months of treatment. I've followed the directions and dosage, but just haven't seen much in the way of positive results. AND THIS STUFF IS EXPENSIVE."
3,Angels' Eyes,"We started using this at the beginning of May. We are a Bichon Frise and Toy Poodle. About a month later we can definitely see the results. It needs to be used every day for three months, and we are off to a good start. We'll have to wait and see what happens after three months. Hopefully all our brown tear stains will be completely gone. After three months, it needs to be used four times a week for a while, then once a week. We will update our review once the three month period has been completed."
1,You have to get it INSIDE the dog! - UPDATED!!!!,"Previously, I wrote a negative review of this product (1 star, which I cannot get Amazon to change). I could not get my dogs to eat the product and felt it was a waste of money. I was adding it to every imaginable food. I then tried offering the Angel Eyes BY ITSELF and they LOVE it. Still won't eat it on their food or water, but only by itself. Okay, so my apologies for the previous review. Once I got this bit of insight, I can saw immediate results! GREAT PRODUCT -- will buy again."
5,tear-stain eliminator,"I was very skeptical of this product working, but having tried everything else and being truly desperate I gave it a shot, WOW what a miracle. After three weeks not a sign of stain. I'm now a true believer."
5,Angels' Eyes - Best Product on the Market,"I have a Malti-Poo who is prone to the dark, ugly tear stains that distracted from her beautiful black eyes. This product is the only thing that works! Forget the topical stuff, it doesn't work and she hates it! This is easy to use and very effective."
5,Angel Eyes,"HiMy little bichon, use to have such dark stains under her eyes, on her bottom and under her mouth.I was told about Angel Eyes and after one bottle, she has no more orange stains.I just mix it into her food. I really think she feels better and has energy now, finally at age 7.5 years.Thank you for such a great product!!Celine"
2,Opinion on Angels Eyes,"The bottle arrives less than half full--I dislike deceptive packaging! It's too early to tell whether it is working--takes several months. A very high price for powdered liver, I think."
1,Not so great,I didn't find that this product made any difference in the tearing of my pups eyes.IF anything made him not want his food much.
2,Crash's crash landing on Gamecube.,"If this game was released before Mario Kart: Double Dash!! I would have given it 4 stars. Sadly though, poor Crash picked the wrong time to crash land on the Gamecube, the time of Mario Kart: Double Dash!! and F-zero GX. It seems like a good racing game at first, but Mario Kart: Double Dash!! makes Crash look like trash. The controls aren't great either and it isn't very fun to race. Sure your little brother might enjoy racing with Crash, but more serious gamers should stick with F-zero GX, Double Dash!! or Kirby Air Ride. This game looks stupid when compared to F-zero GX, Double Dash and Kirby Air Ride. By the way, here's some advice for the person who said this game is good because of the advertisments: companies make the game sound good so people will buy them. It's up to you to play them and see if they are right."
4,Waste of cash.,"I got the game, did a race, thought I was going to die. There was not a way to see what is in-front of you! I tried a battle with my friend, and thought the area was pretty bad. Team play is just bogus and the whole game is pretty bad. Also, it crashes every 20 minutes!"
4,Waste of cash.,"I got the game, did a race, thought it was pretty cool, then it crashed. Crash crashes. I have to restart the GameCube almost every 20 minutes! The battle fields just plain stink, the computers are not the best team play is just bogus the arena editor is worth crap. Don't buy this game it is a waste of money."
1,A ridiculous tale of a detective that ignores the evidence,"Monk, a supposedly superb detective, creates a theory early on about what happens and spends half the book finding supporting evidence for his theory rather than looking for easily obtained contradicting evidence. He shares the circumstantial evidence he has with others who all become absolutely convinced he's right, despite, in the case of the police investigator, having knowledge of contradicting evidence. It all comes out in final climactic scene where the reader should say ""well finally the idiots see reason!""If this were a story about detective work gone wrong, people being wrongly accused, and what can happen when anger blinds people so much they just want a guilty party instead of the truth, this could be decent. As a story about a detective who is supposed to be the best in the district it's immensely frustrating."
4,Love or Hate,"Remember Heather for the first season of Real World. She was a fierce MC and this is a hot piece to add to any real hip hop collection. The item arrived in days and was as advertised, in great condition."
4,Great CD,"I really enjoy the old west. Cowboys for Jesus is not Country music, nor is it southern gospel. It is exactly what it says... cowboys. This is the kind of music you would expect to hear in an old Roy Rogers movie. Good wholesome music that is fun to listen and sing along."
3,ecoast1,"I was truly disappointed with this book. Not because of plot or characters, because the proof reading and grammar were atrocious. It was a task to read and re-read the pages of this book. Virtually every page has errors on it! I don't know what happened that Ms McClellan left Naiad Press but her latest choice of publisher if a definite mistake."
4,so powerful!,I had to look for a new hair dryer since my old Quiet Con Air hair dryer dies after 5 yrs of service. I have chosen this one because I have read that it blows really hard which is what me and my sister was looking for in this kind of equipment because we both have thick long fine hair. It takes us half day to let our hair dry by itself. This one dries our hair fast. The temperature settings were just right for our hair. I hope this will last longer than my old one. It was a little lighter than what I had but same quietness.
1,"AFTER ONE USE, INSIDE STARTING BURNING.","Wow, I bought this about 2-3 weeks ago and opened the package. Around the 2nd time of using, there was a weird burning smell. I thought I could just restart it and the smell would go away. I restarted it 5 TIMES. Smell? Still there. I stopped using it. The burning smell is so strong and spread to the rest of my rooms.And I can't return it now.WTF."
3,Great while it lasted..,"I really liked this dryer in the beginning. It's pretty fast, lightweight, and had a great attachment for my curly hair. Last week it started tweaking out on me and would completely shut off. I played with the filter (not the issue), and finally realized it was the cord connection between the cord and the base of the dryer. I have been able to limp through my morning routine by finding an exact pressure and cord location that the dryer likes and trying to use it that way. It's awful! So, now unfortunately, I'm shopping for a new dryer. All I can figure is it is from the cord being wrapped around the dryer during storage? It's only 2 years or so old, so I'm pretty bummed. In all honesty, if you plan on replacing a dryer every 2 years anyway, you can't go wrong with this one, if you're looking for a keeper though...keep looking."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!,"This product made my hair frizzy and did not dry well at all. Worst of all, within three months it started making a loud humming noise, and burn out. I would never recommend buying this!"
2,Handle Cracked After 3 Months Mild Use! Duct Tape?,"Bought this in February, and noticed in April there were cracks in the handle. It was used about 3 to 4 times a week, a total of 15 minutes, tops, by a 69-year-old woman. It was not dropped or used to beat a rug. So this is ridiculous. Amazon's return policy says I'll only get a portion of the cost returned. Maybe I'll write to Revlon. I guess I can try duct tape, but I won't buy a Revlon hair dryer again."
2,Does not live up to its reviews,"This hair dryer is too loud and really doesn't provide a lot of power when it blows your hair. After a year of use, it's about to die. Gave it two stars -- it was below average, but not entirely a piece of junk. (Close, though.)"
2,Not even worth the cheap price...,"My CHI hairdryer bit the dust after 7 years, so I bought this because it had great reviews and was cheaper. This hair dryer is not good on my hair, I'm going to put it in my garage sale. My hair feels very dry and looks frizzy after using this dryer and I never had that problem with the CHI. Sorry, but I'll spend the money now and get a good hair dryer."
3,It is okay i guess,"This is again another hair care product with rave reviews, that does not live up to its expectations. It's not a bad blow dryer, its just not the best. It is better than my 4 year old heavy conair,that was weak in power. This iron is infact light weight and has a good amount of power and the noise is not annoying, but it does not give a salon look if that is one wants, or should i say a smoother sheen to the hair. It kind of makes my thick somewhat wavey hair really poofy, which is okay i guess because i end up straighting it anyway. So if you want an iron that works decently, i would get this one, but hey, get it at walmart, its half the price, which i discovered the other day."
5,Very good Revlon dryer,"I have bought Revlon dryer for a short time ago. I liked it very much. I can compair it with Conair dryer (almost the same style and size) I have had.Revlon dryer is much more lighter, has more variants of drying. Temperature of drying can be more higher, so I can dry my hair much faster. This dryer is very comfortable."
2,One Major Flaw,"I have bought 2 of these hair dryers because I loved it so much and thought the first one died by a fluke. It wasn't. While it's working this is a great, light-weight, lower noise hair dryer. Unfortunately, after less than a year both started flickering on and off when held at certain angles, and just got worse with continued use. This time I'm not waiting for it to get worse- I'm getting something different."
1,Not Good,"My Chi dryer died after 7 years and I asked for a new one for Christmas. My mother-in law saw all the great reviews on this dryer and got me one instead. Well, Chi it ain't. First of all, it didn't work properly and had to be returned. It didn't heat up at all. Second, it just doesn't have the balance or quality feel of a high end dryer. If it worked, it might be ok for the guest bath, but I'll stick to a professional dryer like a Chi or Babyliss for myself."
4,"Good hair dryer, terrible delivery time","I love this hair dryer. My old dryer would leave my naturally curly hair frizzy and awful when I'd blow it straight, but this is a great machine. My hair now shines with the combination of this dryer and Kiehl's Smooth Silk Creme.Since I wasn't a regular hair dryer user when I ordered this, it didn't inconvenience me so much that this product took a little over a month to arrive. If you need this product, you'd probably be better off paying more plus shipping at Target than to buy from this vendor unless or until this vendor will address this problem.The reason I'm giving this four stars is that it's a great product. I don't feel it's reasonable to pan the product review just because of the service, so I only removed one star for the vendor.Buy the product, be weary of shipping times from this source."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,I had the dryer for about a year. This week it literally caught on fire and sparks came out the back. Pieces of metal shot out damaging the bathroom mirror. Luckily no one was hurt. This product should be taken off the market. If one of the metal pieces went into her my eyes I would have been severely injured.
5,Absolute Best Hairdryer,"I was a little skeptical, because I have fine hair, and many reviews state it's not for fine hair, HOWEVER, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this hairdryer. It is AWESOME on my fine hair. Yes, the buttons are right at your fingertips, so you do have to pay attention, but I don't know where else they would put the buttons. Once you get used to it, your fingers do not tend to push the buttons accidentally. It gets very hot on the hot setting, and just as the button indicates, it's warm on the warm setting. I have fine hair, and I used it on HOT. When I want to straighten my hair, I used the attachment to direct the heat to a certain area; when I wear it curly, I used the diffuser. Someone had mentioned in an earlier review that the attachments are not included; THEY ARE INCLUDED. I got a diffuser, and a directional attachment. It is light weight, NOT TOO LOUD, and all around perfect. If it ever tears up, I will get the exact same thing as a replacement."
2,Just OK,this dryer says it's is less noisier than most other dryers. infact it is Much Louder than my 8yr old dryer. Sounds like the bushings are shot. Drys fine but too noisy.
3,Hate the controls,"The dryer works well and is reasonably priced, but the controls are placed so that when you wrap your hand around the dryer it is practically impossible not to touch them and either get a different setting or turn the dryer off. In my opinion, it should be back to the drawing board to design better placement of the contols."
3,Good dryer but didn't last.,"I had this dryer for around 18 months before it just stopped working. I liked it, used it regularly, and it worked well but I expect my appliances to last longer than that. I'd rather pay $10 more for a dryer that will last a few years."
1,broke after a year,it was good while it lasted. 6 months in something in the heat function broke and it didn't work as well as it originally did. About a year in the whole dryer broke. It will now live in a landfill for millions of years...
1,Beware of sparks.,"When I first got them last year they were great as advertised. Inexpensive, light, quiet and dried hair fairly fast but in 6 months one of them shorted and sparks flew out. Then last week the same thing happened to the other one. Definitely not recommended. This is cheaply made and dangerous."
4,So far so good,"Just got this to replace my T3 that my daughter accidentally dropped in the toilet. My husband had gotten me the T3 as a gift, but I didn't want to shell out that kind of money again unless absolutely necessary. So I'm trying this much cheaper but well reviewed alternative. I've only used it a few times, but so far drying time is relatively fast (maybe takes 4-5 more minutes than the T3) and the result is a nice smooth blowout. So seems like a good value. My hair is long, curly, but not very thick, just for reference."
1,Going right back!,"Can't believe I'm actually reviewing a hair-dryer - I feel ridiculous doing this....but this hair dryer is horrible! I'm sending it right back to Amazon (of course, they make this very easy). Barely ANY air came out with the diffuser on and the blower was too strong without it. I'm so glad it's returnable."
1,"Garbage, fire hazard - do not buy!","About four months after purchasing this hair dryer, which left my hair looking dry and brittle, it started turning on and off intermittently while in use. I had to twist the cord with one hand to make the wires connect while trying to use the hairdryer with the other. One day I got a nasty electrical shock when I turned it on, and it started sparking.I took it apart at some point before I threw it out to see if I could fix it, and it turns out that their ""Ionic/tourmaline technology"" translates to the hot air being blown through a cardboard toilet paper tube that has been spray-painted gold. Apparently gold paint = tourmaline? I think not.Do NOT buy this product. It is falsely advertised and a fire hazard."
4,Great dryer,"This is definitely worth the price. It is the lightest weight dryer I have ever handled and it does dry my hair quicker. Not sure why anyone would want the heat to get hotter than it does, it works just fine on the high setting. I don't know how long this is going to last, but even if it is just for a year, it was worth it. What do you expect for $17?"
1,Nice if you want it for only 1 month,"Nice dryer that was powerful. I did say ""was""! It lasted one month and then just quit."
5,Great Dryer,"I had read in many places that this was a good ionic hair dryer. It was indeed very light and quieter than other 1875 watt dryers I've used before. I found the high/low heat settings to match exactly what I had expected. The high heat was hot enough to dry my hair quickly but not so hot that I felt like my hair was about to fry. The strength of the fan was good as well. I felt like maybe the high fan could have been a little more, but it might be a psychological thing due to the quieter sounds."
4,Great purchase!,"I really like this hair dryer. It's affordable and works great! I have long, very thick, semi-straight hair and this is able to dry my hair in about 3 minutes. I debated purchasing a more expensive model for the guarantee of better quality (of course that's not always the case), but from my research, this model is just as high-powered and well-reviewed as the more expensive brands. I find that for straight hair, you can save on the dryer but splurge on a good-quality straightener. Likewise you should save on the shampoo (it's all basically the same ingredients) but splurge on a good conditioner. I've found that this makes all the difference for getting smooth, straight hair."
4,Good dryer,"Good dryer. I was looking for something to replace my old ionic dryer, which I loved and which (sadly) finally died, and tried out numerous products from different stores and manufacturers. Unfortunately, this one isn't quite as powerful as I wanted (ionic dryers just don't seem to compare to regular ones), but it's the best of the five or six that I tried."
5,Light Weight and Works Great,I really like this hair dryer. It's a great deal. I like how light weight it is and how quickly it dries.
5,Great product!!,I LOVE this oil! So does my 9 year old daughter! Leaves your skin feeling silky and smooth! The price I purchased it at was PHENOMENAL!! Recommend the product!
1,Not the Music Expected,"Before you purchase, if there is an option to listen to the music, PLEASE do so. I didn't follow my own advice and now have an album that I'll probably never listen to again. This ""I'm Gonna Miss You"" is not the popular version being played on the oldies segments of the radio stations. I purchased it just for that reason. The rest of the album does not make up for the one bad song. Sound quality is okay, but not worth the purchase. Buyer Beware!!!"
5,da best,this game is da best. it is the only volleyball game for ps2. the x box volleyball games are both mature. my friend who is on my volleyball team has a xbox and he wants a volleyball game for it but he isnt aloud to get mature games which is what all xbox's volleyball games are. any way back to the game in a little while i was spiking the ball and serving it.the graphics are great. the girls are hot . i got cheats and got better players and more bikinis for the girls. the mini games are fun too. the best part is the tournament you play all over the us. that is why i gave this game 5 stars
3,The Outsiders was a book of courage and freindship.,"The Outsiders was a book to show the reader what really happens in the world, instead of just having a ""happily ever after"" kind of ending. The book showed good freindship and bravery, for Ponyboy, the main character of the book, had many freinds and many acts of showing his little sense of courage. This book has many seens that are not realistic but you must learn to look beyond that and see the true value of each scene. Do you want to read a sad, happy kind of book? If you do read The Outsiders it is filled with sarcasism and sad emotions."
1,Very depressing,"I had to read this book in my class. Maybe it's just me, but this book DISTURBED me. I hate reading about gangs and death and violence. Some people might think I'm a whimp, but in my opinion this book is disturbing, and very depressing with absolutely no uplifters. It's really not enjoyable to read about people getting stabbed and burned up and assaulted by Socs. So I'm warning you, if you can't stand to read about violence and death and you don't like depressing stories, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!"
5,Awesome,"We studied this book in language arts at school. It's a really good book. When we weren't allowed to read more than 1 chapter a night, I was struggling. It was super hard to put it down. S.E. Hinton did an awesome job with this book. I think it can really connect to kids today. Instead of there being Greasers and Socs, there are the preps and the nerds. So, this book doesn't only deal with the 60s. I think this was the best book we've studied all year!"
5,High School student,"I enjoyed reading 'The Outsiders'. It's a fun book to read and informative aswell. I am not the book type of person, but I read this book like there was no tomarrow (even though i knew there was). The main charicter Ponyboy Curtis lives with his two brothers Soda and Darry. Darry is a tough, dad-like brother while Soda took up the caring mom-like position. The three have good and hard times even though both their parents have died. These three are also part of a gang called the 'Greasers' who are in an ongoing battle with the 'Socs'. Other members of the 'Greasers' are Dally, Two-Bit, and Johnny. This book contains realistic views of the life of teens and how they go through conflicts in school and at home. The book also contains the sort of relationships teens are involved in with friends, enemies, girls or guys, brothers or sisters, and parents. I highly recomend this book to anyone looking for a good one. Thanks for taking the time to read this."
4,"I liked it, but some parts were boring.","At first it was pretty boring.But in the second chapter it became more exciting.There were parts of the book that were very depressing.But this is the type of book that is not afraid of telling it how it is.It talks about some real life situations.I recommend this book to anyone, and especially young people who don't know what some people go through."
5,It's Da Bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I'm a 6th grader from Virginia. I read this book for a school project and the rest of my group wanted to read this book. You know the saying, the majority wins. I'm glad it's that way. I loved every part of theis book. The Outsiders was one- excuse me, the best book I've ever read. It's amazing that a young 16 year old would be able to write such a great book. The outsiders is about a young boy named Ponyboy who tries to survive int he cruel world of ours. His parents are dead. He depends on his two older brothers for support and love."
3,A great book that's sure to please many people.,"This book is very good. I had fun reading it. S.E. Hinton is a very good writer. The story is very good. Read the book please, because it's very good."
3,The Outsiders,I thought the book was good because of all the heroism and bravery in the book. With some events your stomach will turn and some you will feel sad. This will probably change your view of street gangs in the big cities. Most of the problems in the story are caused by neglect. It's really interesting and has lots of detail in it. Ponyboy runs into trouble everywhere he turns in the big city.
5,thie book was extraordinary!!!!!!!!!!,this book was so good it was filled with a good story line and a great climax once you start you won't want to put it down START READING IT NOW!!!!
4,The Outsiders,"I thought The Outsiders was a very good book. I was required to read the book for my Honors English class. Usually I don't like the books we have to read in there, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It seemed as if I shouldn't even be reading it because I normally don't like the books we are required to read. However, I really liked this book, and I recommend it to anyone, especially teenagers who don't normally enjoy reading."
2,the outsiders,the outsiders is not very good... i dont like rumble fish... s.e. hinton is not very good.
4,the review,i really do not like reading books all that much it really isn't my favorite thing in the world but this book seemed to get me interested. i really did not want to put this book down. this book had a really good lesson to learn about it. I would reallly lke for yuo ot raed this book
5,The Outsiders,I think this book was the best book I have read about teens and gangs.This is a good lecture were teens can read and think more about geting involved with gangs.It teachs you more about why teens get involve in gangs because they need love and they go and get it with his gang members.This story is about gangs and the love they have for each other they soppport every member of their gang on everything they do everybody follows along.
4,GOOD BOOK!!!!!,"The outsiders is a good book. It isn't the best that I ever read, but is a book that have a deep message about social differences. The problem that Ponyboy have, is really difficult; his strong frienship strings to Jhonny, shows how important is to have a friend. I really recomend you to read this book because it will give you a reflection about the differences on the social classes, and how importan is the tolerance"
5,The best book ever!!!!!,"...I thought that the book was just awesome. It had many climacticparts and had an excellent plot. The story sounds so real that Ithought I was in it. It seemed so real, like it was based on a truestory. The characters have verey funny names like Pony Boy and theauthor detailed them so good I could imagen them in my head what theylooked like. On a scale from 1-10 I give it a 10 which is very good. Ithink that people that like a story with great characters, action, anddrama would love to read ""The Outsiders"" by S.E. Hinton."
4,Outsiders,"We read th Outsiders in my explorotory. The characters are very real and have meny exciting lives. This book seemes very real. The boys do not have the gratest life, but they have lots of friendship for each other.My favorit characters is Ponyboy hes's not like the other ones in the gang.Ponyboy is more kind and get good grads. You shuld read this book it is he best book I have ever read"
4,The Outsiders,"The Outsiders is an excellent book full of acyion, excitement, suspense, and friendship. One of the likeable aspects of the book is that the characters are ""down to earth"" and they are not perfect. This makes the reader feel comfortable. There are several things to be learned from reading The Outsiders, one is that one should learn to understand, accept, and be kind to your enemies. Also, everyone is human and everyone has their faults"
4,The symbolics of the Outsiders,"THe Outsiders is a good book because it shows the symbols to relate to present day events. it shows that two groups will not always get along and most times end up in a fight. As is happening in Isreal with the Jews and Palastinians. It also shows that everybody has a good side even the bad ones, as Dally saved the kids, and Johnny. When Johnny and Ponyboy went to Windrexvliie it showed that everybody tries to run from there problems. When dally goes and kills himslef shows that all people care about somone. The school shootings can tie in with this because it shows that nobody can get along with everybody. So it is a good book in that it is symbolic of life today and the story is a plot I will never forget the rest of my life."
5,This represents america,"This book is a perfect example of the problems in our society, and reading this book you do not realize how real it is even though some might look at it as just a story told by S.E Hinton look. I loved, and I could not put it down"
1,Fun Stuff,My mommy is helping me write this review because I can't read yet.She read this book to me and she said it was good so I will take her word for it. Bye bye and peace always. I just spotted a funnel cloud so I going to crawl my self down to the basemant.
5,This is my all time favorite book.,Iwas in 5th grade the first time I read The Outsiders and at 22 it is still my favorite. It took me one day to finish it and I turned it over and read it all over again. It was the first book that ever made me cry. It helped me realize the power of the written word. I am thrilled that it appears on so many school reading list.
5,this book was very good,"This book was about two groups of gangs. one group was called the greasers(they were poor), and the other group was called the socs(they were rich). I thought the book was really good. After reading the book it makes me want to watch the movie."
5,The outsiders,"At 16-years-old writing a book like this is AMAZING! This is the best book I have ever read in my life in fact the only book I have ever read. This book is about two-gangs that do not like each other.The gangs are the Socs(the rich kids) and the greaser( the poor and bad kids). The Socs like to beat up the greasers because they think they look weird and have funny hair. Well some of the character in the story are pony boy, soda pop, Derry, dally, Steve, two-bit, cherry, randy, sandy, bob, jonnie, Tim shepherd, and bob. All of these character have a very important role in this story.The major charter and narrator of this story is pony boy. He goes through a lot in this book. I strongly recommend this book to everyone, especially teenagers.(...)"
5,the outsiders book by S.E Hinton,the summary of the book is that ponyboy (main character in story)learns about life. he learns that nothing can last forever. he also proves that it is always in people to help other people. he and johnny helped the little kids out of the church.the lessons in the book is to do what your heart tells you. and not to lie and to stick with your friends. this is a good book for everyone cause it has life values in it.my opinion of the book is the it was good but it didnt tell enough about the characters i think that she needs to tell more about the characters like what they are like and what they do for a living.
5,"Great Price & Fast Delivery from ""momoftwinsplustwo""","Purchased this used paperback (""The Outsiders,"" S. E. Hinton) for my daughter's 8th grade reading assignment. Delivery was promised three weeks later. Yikes! That would be cutting it close. Fortunately, the book arrived within a week.The book was just as described -- used but still very readable. It is an older edition, yet there was no ""old book"" smell. I would gladly purchase other items from ""momoftwinsplustwo."""
1,"Terrible, undeveloped characters","I read this book back in the 1970's when I was in 7th grade. It was an assigned book. It was a terrible read and I found the violence to be in the book because it was needed to advance the characters. Good books should be lead by great characters. Violence, or any action should only be in the book if it's character lead - not the other way around. No wonder this author got a D+ in English! This book, and movie only survive because teachers have been taught that they must teach this book.While the ""idea"" of this book is interesting, exploring class warfare through the eyes of teenagers, the book itself is not worth reading. Hopefully the educational system will catch on and stop making kids read this horrid book!"
5,"Stay Gold, Ponyboy, Stay Gold.","This book is by far the best book I've ever read and ever will read. I'm 13, I've read it about 10 times I guess. I love Ponyboy and Sodapop so much. The problems they face are just like are today, well ofcourse it's not soc's and Greasers now, but what does that matter. I love Susan, just for understanding teens, and for writing this book and all her others, I have 'em all. It's so emotianal but that's why so many kids love it, And whoever that loser from Vancouver is, that trashed this book, I pity you. I love you Sue, and Thanks, - Kelly"
5,It sould get a 100,This book was the best i ever read. (i have read alot to) I finshed it in like 2 1/2 hours and it was great. -ethan
4,The Outsiders,"The Outsiders is a book about three brothers and some really close friends. They have all been treated badly because they are considered lower class. They are in a gang called the ""Greasers."" But when things go to far in a rival gang fight, and one of the Socs (their rival gang) members is killed, the plot becomes more and more interresting. It has an ending that the reader would never have anticipated! The action gradually picked up through out the book and got better and better! This is a terrific book and will keep you begging for more!"
5,The outsiders,"I loved the ending. Great flash back. Can't believe S.E. Hinton started writing this at age 15! The story really spoke to me about...i want to say about segregation. People just need to realize that all people are human and people are just born with different circumstances. That doesn't mean they shouldn't be friends. Whether you're a born greaser or a soc, you don't have to be sworn enemy.The Outsiders"
5,THE BEST BOOK IN THE WHOLE WORLD!!!!!,"THIS IS MY MOST FAVORITE BOOK IN THE WHOLE WORLD!!!! it was really touching and sad, but it was interesting. i had to read it 4 english and i didnt think i would love it, but now, i dont want to stop reading it. I read it twice in 2 days, but im a major reader. i suggest that other people read this book because it is so good. it is about friendship and sticking together no matter what happens. i cant put this book down and i think that im gonna read it again now... so bye ppl!"
4,The Outsider,"This book, was written in the 60's and I had to read this book for english class. It describes about how there where just so many conficts between there family,and friends. The two book was about these two gangster and how there names where about the Scos which they where the rich and though that they where the bads. Then you had the Greaser that where the low life people. where they where always pick on by the Socs."
4,The Outsiders,"""The Outsiders""The Outsiders, a book which I was assigned to read, was surprisingly good. When it was first given to the class I had doubted that it would have an in-depth plot. However, to my chagrin, the story turned into an involving tale about teenage gangs in the 60's. In the story, a few members of the ""Greasers"" get into rather serious trouble when they kill a ""Social"". In order to avoid being caught two of the murderers flee to country where they hide out for a week. When they return, their lives had changed like they never imagined they would.I believe that this book represents the results of gang activity. It has changed slightly over the years, but the general result remains. This book's real-life plot was enjoyable and informative. I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to read a book with a true-story resemblance and a few interesting surprises."
3,My thoughts about the book,"Ralph the mouse just can't resist trying to ride the toy motorcycle someone left on the hotel room tabel. It's the telephone ringing that sends Ralph and the bike sailing right off the table and down into the wastepaper basket.Ralph thinks he's a goner-trapped in the basket-until along comes Keith, the owner of the motorcycle. Not only does Keith save Ralph's life, he teaches him how to ride. And that's just the beginning of Ralph's exciting nighttime adventures in the hallways of the hotel!"
2,Too Basic and Overpriced,"While there are a couple of good forms that one can use, this book is far to short (only 10 pages in length) and presented ideas that are far too basic (business 101 concepts like ""business cards are important"").....!There are better pet sitting business books on the market."
1,Very ridiculous cost for a few simple pages! `,"The description of this book should read: ""A few simple pages about Pet Sitting"". The information isn't bad, however, the price is WAY out of range! Had I known this book was nothing more than this, I never would have purchased it. Very disappointing."
2,Natural Calm,"I did not know until I received the product that it was a sports drink supplement, and the recommended measurements weren't like the ones I've seen on the individual packages of Natural Calm. I've only used it 3 times since I bought it, and it didn't make me feel as well as the original Natural Calm supplement made me feel. I will just stick with the original version from now on. The only thing I found good about this product was the taste. Other than that, it was of no use to me."
4,A great way to learn conversational French!,"I had learnt French in school a couple of decades ago but never acquired proficiency in conversational French. I bought this set of CDs and found it to be very user friendly. The pace is just right and the level of instruction, while thorough, is light enough to be listened to in my car on my daily commutes to and from work. I'm on the 3rd CD and do feel that i've learnt quite a bit from the first two. Thanks, Pimsleur!"
4,very good,It's good for someone that wants to test the waters to learn this language. I listen mostly in the car. It progresses at a comfortable pace and builds on previous lessons. It a shortened version of the course and affordable. I've tried other products either from here on Amazon or on the internet. This one's the best I've found so far.
5,Great for a Four-Year-Old,My niece loved this paper doll. It's durable and sturdy. It's just what I wanted for her. She loves it.
4,"Great toy, poor packaging","My daughter has one of these and while the toy itself is a lot of fun, the packaging leaves some to be desired. The dress pieces and the doll come in a little partitioned box, which is perfect, but it doesn't have any type of lid to keep the pieces in. This is great if you're keeping it neatly on a shelf, but makes it hard to take with you anywhere without your own storage container."
4,Cheap protection; works well,I ordered 5 of these of various sizes and all came in undamaged and fit well onto each lens. I have not noticed any distortion with any of them.
4,Good value and a light shovel,"The shovel arrived promptly with free shipping--my idea of a good deal.I found the shovel to be much lighter than my aluminum ones, and this quality helped immensely in shoveling my long driveway. I wasn't sure if the tip of the plastic shovel head would last, but I was able to wedge it under ice and snow and lift fairly easily. I don't believe it will last as many years as the metal snow shovels, but I can see getting six or seven years out of it. Where I live we get about three to five snows a year that require shoveling or blowing."
3,Lightweight shovel- good value for money,"Great shovel for light snow and good value for the money, but the plastic is too flimsy to use for any heavy show or to get under any ice."
3,Philips 20&quot; Flatscreen/DVD Combo,"I received my Philips 20&quot; TV as a service award from work. My kids enjoyed watching DVD movies on it for about one month. We also enjoyed listening to CDs. Now, after only one month of using, the DVD no longer works and I have to haul it to a service center for repair! :-("
3,Kind of Interesting,Some history of different styles is included which I found interesting. This book looses a lot since the photographs were omitted. Written from historical upper class perspective.
1,order a different version!,"I ordered this play to read for a class in school.Not only was this ""robot generated"" edition extremely difficult to read due to typos and random formatting inconsistencies, but portions of it were completely missing - for example 2 entire scenes in act 4.I actually need to know what happens, and reading this version, I don't.You get some kind of membership with it that means you can view this play, and other books, online, but if I'd wanted to read the play online, I would have done so with one of the free sites that offers complete verions of texts that are in the public domain.Apparently, the ""robot"" technology saves on costs, and if it had cost me 2 or 3 dollars, I may have been more forgiving, but it was not, in my opinion, priced low enough to justify the extremely shabby quality.If you need to read this play, or want to own it (it is a classic, and the story itself is worthwhile), FIND ANOTHER VERSION!"
3,works but delicate,"The DVD player works fine and arrived on time. The only downside to this item is the color seems over saturated even after making adjustments on my television and the player. The second complaint is that the door where the dvd is inserted seems to get stuck a bit. Lastly, you definitely need to use the remote control to operate the player. It has buttons for on/off, play, etc. but, they don't actually work for me. Overall, I believe it is great for the money."
1,I love their other products but this didn't work,"My dog has had UTIs all her life. Every month (or so) she is afflicted with yet another one. I have tried diet changes, even to raw food, different water, distilled, bottled (Voss), and finally this product. It was cheaper than the $112 Clavamox they usualy prescribe, but had to use SO much of it, and it is in such a small bottle for so much money. While using it, she got yet another infection. I thought I should continue using it, that I didn't give it a fair enough shot. I kept using it but it didn't do much to help. I was left with having to fall back on expensive drugs. :( So disappointed, but I am glad they offer a money back guarantee. Too much money anyhow."
3,Good Resource,"If you are looking for a beginner lighting course, this books is just what you need. It goes through lighting applications per room/area, explains how to calculate foot candles, but if you want to read more about lighting plans, layouts, electrical requirements.....I would say - keep looking.This is a good quick resource with little technical detail."
4,I love this song.,Deborah Cox's song Nobody's Suppose to be here is great. One reason I think so is because I know what she's feeling like during this song. Your heart gets broken and you think you'll never love again but then you turn around and BAM. You're falling again.
4,This book has bite!,"An excellent collection of stories, including a Sookie Stackhouse tale by Charlaine Harris you must read if you want to stay informed on the whole series. (And trust me, you do.) I must admit I was a bit let down by the MaryJanice Davidson story...the ending didn't seem to live up to the promise of the beginning. Overall, though,this was a highly entertaining book."
3,Skip the First Two Stories,The first to stories were two of the worst I have ever read. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. But the last three stories make up for the others; especially Angela Knight's.
3,It was alright,"I'm not big on books of this style where a whole bunch of authors contribute their own stories, most of them turn out boring. This book wasn't bad at all, it's a decent read."
1,One out of five IS bad!,This anthology did absolutely nothing for me. The only story that keeps it from sinking into vampire hell is Angela Knight's 'Galahad'.The other four just plainly sucked (and I don't mean that literally).So not worth the money. :(
3,"Review from So Many Books, So Little Time","This is going to be a short review because it's always hard for to write about anthologies. It's hard for me to go deeper into short stories.I've only ever read books by Charlaine Harris and MaryJanice Davidson before. So while the other short stories were interesting and fun, I wasn't completely into their world. I enjoyed reading MaryJanice Davidson's story. It took me a couple of pages to get where Queen Betsy came into play. But I so love her. She's the first paranormal character that I loved and got me into my paranormal phase. As for Charlaine Harris's story...it was interesting to read more about Sookie's cousin Hadley. I got a little bit more of a back story than we got in the novel."
3,Decent enough for getting your feet wet...,"A friend had recommended Laurell K. Hamilton to me, so I thought this was perfect to try. It was a little short, but it made me go out and buy Guilty Pleasures as soon as I finished it, so I guess it did it's job!"
5,Another great job by Pauline Turner,This book basically takes you by the hand and teaches you to crochet. M's Turner leaves nothing to chance and clearly explains what steps you need to take to accomplish the project at hand.I recommend this book highly for beginner crocheters.
4,From a Die Hard SONY fanatic,"I have almost everything SONY. A 36"" HDTV, 2 DVD players, Computer, Laptop, MP3 player, Digital Camera, Mini-Cam, even my VCR that is 10 years old is SONY, but the Philips 20"" TV is the best on the market. Save yourself the $130+ for the two high end SONY 20"" TVs and go with the Philips. Much better picture and sound. The only thing you don't get is a clock and On-Timer with the Philips. You do get a Sleep Timer though. And don't even look at the SONY that is $279, I had it and returned it within 3 days. It was crap."
1,It stinx!,"When I recieved this product, It was in good condition but broke 5 months later. Besides that, It was extremely ugly. I ou are going to spend this much on this bad of a tv, please get a different one.None of this was Target's fault."
3,Not bad but not delicious either!,"Vas' In the Garden of Souls is a wonderful addition to your melancholy music library with an extra kick. The Inward Coil (#7) is the center of the CD: the rest of the melodies mold around it.The Indian sounds are soft and fluttery and at some points you get a little Asian flair. Azam Ali's voice rises above the music-her voice with Greg Ellis' instrumental skill is magnificent.On the other side, the album is a bit forgettable because its river of mystical music flows one way and is so smooth."
4,Middle Eastern ecstasy,"Azam Ali possesses an extraordinary voice, like none I've ever heard, and combined with Greg Ellis's drum and other instrumental work, this music is purely delightful. The best sample you should hear is the one from ""Inamorata"", my personal favorite on this album. Yet while I love this CD, I'd have to rank it as 4 stars only because I think their second album, Offerings, offers slightly more variation in sounds. Try them both."
4,Same as The Anoymous Venetian!!,"This is, as are all of Donna Leon's novels, excellent. However - it is the SAME book as ""The Anonymous Venetian"", so beware, those who are completing their Brunetti collection.I hate the way American publishers slap new titles on British books."
1,"It maybe cheap, but it will die on you in a few month","I bought a Akai LCD TV 3 months ago. It is dead now. No sound and no picture. Their customer service was terrible, also. I will not ever buy this brand any more."
3,A Mitford-like story,"There is something of the feeling of the Mitford books in this pleasant tale of an elderly Catholic woman from a small Minnesota town. The characters are quirky but real, with unexpected but believable humanity."
4,Teaching Manners the easy way ...,"I'm using this book as a basis for teaching a Manners class to fourth graders. It's organized and easy to follow, making the lessons short and to the point. The children love the class and are practicing what they are learning."
5,inspirational,A great book to have. Each heroic story summorized with photos on two pages each. You can read for hours or for minutes at a time either way you are impressed with the courage these brave men had.
5,The most useful proverbs and sayings book in the market.,Includes all of the essential and modern American Proverbs and Sayings. Having rating stars for freqent ones. Ample example of sentence usages from true various sources. Crystally clear explanations and very easy to understand. Readable formats and great price. Suitable for everyone who wants to improve his or her delicious sayings.
5,I love it!,Favorite taylor swift cd! Her first album is classic and more country than the rest... I love it!
5,brilliant cd,Her debut album maybe be even better than her world famous sophmore album Fearless because it sounds more country. But I love Fearless too.1. Tim McGraw - 9.5/10 great 1st single2. Picture to Burn - 10/10 one of the best3. Teardrops on My Guitar - 9/104. A Place In this world - 9/105. Cold As You - 10/10 one of the best6. The Outside - 10/10 great7. Tied Together With a Smile - 9/108. Stay Beautiful - 9.5/109. Should've Said No - 9.8/1010. Mary's Song - 10/10 great11. Our Song - 10/10 one of the best12. I'm Only Me When I'm With You - 10/10 one of the best13. Invisible - 10/10 great14. A Perfectly Good Heart - 6/10 my least favorite15. Teardrops on my guitar (Pop Version) - 8.5/10
4,Great Young Talent!,"Taylor Swift is a great singer and songwriter and she's only 17! This girl has a long career in front of her and I intend to pay attention to the ride. She demands as much with my favorite ""Just Another Picture To Burn."""
2,taylor,the cd came ok but the case was broken and scraped up :( i was going to give it as a gift so i had to go out a buy a cheap case for it.
3,"Good CD, beware this is the edited version!","Good CD, but beware that Amazon doesn't tell you this is the edited version. Not that Taylor Swift is excessively obscene to begin with, but some of the lyrics on this CD have been edited from the original.Maybe good for you, maybe bad. I'll still listen to it, but I generally prefer the unedited versions because I want to hear the original intention of the song, not the radio edit."
5,amazing!,Taylor Swift is just the most amazing country artist out there!She is just so unique and her voice is soo great!i love the whole album!
4,Very Funky!,"I don't know very much about jazz, but something I know is that the blue series from blue note has some great compilations (I also have blue brazil which is an excelent CD). Blue Funk is great jazz funk, not the more comercial funk we are used to, but very good (and jazzy) funk from the late '60 and early '70 made by very good and creative musicians. I specially like ""Down Home Funk"" by Richard Holmes and the cover of Sly Stone's Family Affair."
4,Extraordinary - healing,"This book is absolutely remarkable. It is not only astonishing but also very informative and very comforting. I read it within a couple of hours and I sort of ""woke up"" moved, full of energy and full of optimism. I immediatly wanted to meet Mr. Southwood. This book will be a companion for me.While reading many questions came into my mind - I am glad there is the other very good book ""teach me how to love...."" which provides many answers in a very touching, sometimes amusing way."
4,Buy it now if you want it,"DGM somewhere along the way reorganized and many of the non-Crimson albums have gone out of issue, which leads one to suspect that this compilation will disappear once the stock is depleted.DGM is now associated with Inner Knot."
3,A Gateway Disc (3.5 Stars),"At the time this CD came out, I was dating a Jamaican woman. She pressed me to buy this album even though I was more of a Bob Marley fan. I wasn't really into dancehall. But Beenie Man changed my perspective. I know this isn't the purest form of dancehall reggae that one can purchase, but it was a tolerable initial sample for me. It spoon fed me small bits of dancehall in between all the hip hop influenced songs. Now I love dancehall. This album helped me get into it. This is a great starter album if you're not already heavy into dancehall reggae.Personal Favorites: Haters & Fools, Ola feat. Steve Perry, Girls Dem Suga, Crazy Notion, Original Tune(probably the best song on the CD), Art & Life, Jamaica Way feat. Kelis, & Trus Me"
5,great comic,thrill of the hunt does a great job of following the movie and the comic origins of avp. this perticullar comic has great art and an amazing original story.
1,Worked for 4 days,"My experience with this boombox was horrible. I bought it, it worked fine for the first 4 days, then the cd player got messed up. It wouldn't load my cds, instead, the cds would spin out of control in the player. This boombox is not recommended."
2,Colby CX-CD241 Portable CD player,"Plays okay for occasional listening, but will start making a knocking noise above a low vclume or after about 45 minutes of listening."
2,Nothing New,"There is nothing new to learn in this flimsy ""dating guide"". It is just a compilation of things that have been previously written (and read) elsewhere. For example, ""if you meet someone online, don't give them your last name."" I think we all pretty much know that already.As far as tips on where to go in a particular city, it is just lists of the already known bookstores, restaurants, etc. Again, nothing new or ""insider info""In additon, all it is is a flimsly pamphlet with gray typeface (which is very hard to read). The price hardly matches the item.All in all, a disappointment. Don't bother"
3,Body & Soul - No Cues,I have worked out to this video and the moves are fine and you can build up a good sweat. The problem is that the instructor does not provide cues consistently so that you know what your next move is...so I felt like I was always behind the eight ball...the strength training section was very good.
1,Doesn't float well,I couldn't keep this thing upright whether it had one tablet in it or six. It was lop-sided even when it came out of the box. Don't waste your money on this thing. There must be better products out there.
5,Nothing like It!,"The Good Corporate Citizen: A Practical Guide is a very detailed and complete handbook on corporate philanthropy for those corporations that that wish to make a meaningful contribution to the improvement of their communities, but it is extremely useful for individuals and family foundations that want to make a difference as well. Ms. Rubenstein has done an excellent job of raising the questions that donors must answer in this extremely complex area of philanthropy. And the book is just what the title says - it's an extremely practical guide with lots of examples and helpful detail.Ames Sheldon, Director of Development, College of Biological Sciences, University of Minnesota"
5,A creative way for kids to practice counting and learn about golf!,"I bought this book at a PGA event and fell in love with it. My 3 year old twins (boy and girl) LOVE this book! Not only does it introduce golf terms to them, but it makes counting fun and it has a cute rhyming sequence for each page. Would highly recommend it!"
3,Another self-help book,"I had heard a lot about this book and picked it up at a garage sale. There are some useful things in here, and given how old it is, it really is a classic. However, some of it seems dated, and some of it seems really obvious."
1,Think twice before spending your money,"This is a very selfish book with the potential to be damaging. In very grounded, seemingly common sense language, it tells you how to manipulate people for your own ends rather than treating people fairly and as ends in themselves. And even if that alone isn't enough to discourage you from reading this book, I very much doubt the techniques work. People are not so easily fooled."
3,Not bad but nothing special.,"I didn't find the book useful because the info is nothing new, it is just written in a grand style using famous people and much embellishment. In fact I found the book boring.On the other hand if you don't have much common sense dealing with people or are very stubborn or self-centered you can pick up some tips. But I'd recommend a modern day book by Ben Stein or others that is lighter and more fun to read.Whoever criticized the book for being manipulative -- you didn't read the book. The author states the points must come from the heart (an attitude adjustment) and not superficial comments to accomplish what you want.Whoever called the book a classic, give me a break.p.s. The author assumes all couples are straight and the husband is the bread winner and the wife stays home and cooks/cleans."
4,"So many imitators, here's the original","Is this merely a machiavelian handbook for flatterers and manipulators or is it a breakthrough in the science of human relations? This book, published in 1937, is a classic and has inspired thousands of imitators and followers down through to motivational speakers and other modern day purveyors of advice. Why not read the original? Many of the lessons in these pages seem obvious and common sense but there lies the beauty: Carnegie challenges us to act on the obvious insights and implement the realizations in our daily lives. Strategies are spelled out in a straight-forward manner and numerous examples are shown."
4,Homework,"My husband was supposed to read this book for a class. He never finished it, but I did. Great book. A classic must read in this genre. All these years later it's easy to remember the principles taught in the book. I love the story telling too. Storytelling really communicated a principle to me, like in the book,The Zigzag Principle: The Goal Setting Strategy that will Revolutionize Your Business and Your LifeIt don't read a ton of self-help, business, or advice books. But of the ones I've read, these two are primo!"
2,As I lose my top 500 reviewer rating...,"Having noticed that this work is once again popular, I could not resist commenting.Dale Carnegie's work has nothing whatever to do with cultivating genuine friendship. It is based mainly on giving the appearance of being interested in others, solely in order to use them to attain some personal goal. There is some valuable advice (for example, how one gains nothing from contradicting others), but the general tone is completely self-centered.I suppose my many years in purchasing management flavour my assessment here, because the techniques Dale Carnegie recommends still are widely used in sales (though long-term customers are seldom deceived, it is an understood game). This book may be useful to those who have only business gain in mind. However, its total emphasis on furthering one's own interests, and basically insincere approach, rules out any value for those who have true friendship in mind."
3,not a bad book,"This book is not bad but not fantastic. These behaviours : do not show your feelings, do not share anything negative regarding yourself, say to other what they want to hear, listening to others, being considerate, being soft, ..., is self-destructive after a while."
3,I don't like the writing style.,"I wanted to learn more about people and how they work but instead, the writer makes me feel like I need to learn more about myself because I am not capable of making friends. He writes as if I acknowledge that I have a problem. I don't think I have a problem, just a deficient skill. I have moments when I do things right and moments when I am wrong. This book does not cater to my needs. ""The Magic of Thinking Big"" was a better book for me."
4,A personal development must have,"I respect Mr. Carnegie tremendously. This book is a classic. Provides a great foundation for developing people skills and positive influence. The techniques are insightful and are very practical. This book will motivate you. Provides great tips for dealing with people, such as smiling and staying away from criticism. This book will really help with your speaking skills. Highly recommend reading for any business owner or entrepreneur."
4,very useful,"There's a lot of bad mouthing about how these concepts aren't taught to modern business students. I believe that is complete malarky. However, if you want to gain a little insight into personal relations without taking a class, here you go. Great read, enjoyable, and informative."
2,Will not load to Kindle Reader in Samsung Galexy S3,"I have loaded several books to my Android in the past 3 weeks and read them all without problem but this book will not load. Tried several times. No joy. I know the book is one of the best if not the best human relations book ever written. But if you cannot read it, what good is it, right. Amazon pls fix ASAP."
4,I wish read this book 20 years ago.,"Very good book to read. I wish read it 20 years ago. First half of this book is really good, but second half is kind of short. Some chapters required more detail."
5,amazing book,i have not finish reading it but from reading it so far it a good book. any one who wish to make friend should buy this book.
4,Powerful Book,"This was a required book fro my marketing class, but the life lessons and people described throughout are worth it for all people of all backgrounds. It is a worthwhile read."
5,read it again,"I just finished this book for the first time and I feel like I should turn around and start reading it all over again. Everything that this book sets forth as effective communicative skills is a basic knowledge that each one of us, for the most part, already posesses. But how necessary it is for someone to bring that knowledge to the forefront of our attention! My main stumbling block while reading this book was immediately thinking of those around me that are poor in one skill or the another. I don't think Carnegie intended this book as an instrument in pushing others below ourselves, but a guide book in helping us to see and treat others as we should."
1,"Beware of this book, and DO NOT recommend it to others","Please be cautious about reading this book, and make sure you read it with a critical eye.I first read this book when I was 14, and thought it was the greatest book I'd ever read. I believed in everything it said and applied it in my daily life. The principles appeared to work for a short time, however in the long run they DO NOT WORK, and lead to years of misery and suffering! This book has ruined my life for the past 15 years, I wish I never read it, and I wish I could unlearn it.I was not critical of books when I was 14, and I believed the principles in this book would work. They do for the short term, and then they backfire! You must read this book with a critical eye, or it will ruin you; and please don't read it to children, because it will ruin their lives too."
3,Good advice for the outgoing.,"This book mainly offers examples of a practical form of diplomacy. Don't criticize people directly so as to shame them; always articulate your sincere compliments when appropriate; make an effort to remember and use a person's name, etc. There's some good advice here on finessing your speech to get your honest point across without causing anyone to begrudge you for it, and some ways to train yourself not to take people for granted.However, this book was written a long time ago, for people with average or better communications skills. If you're shy and introverted, or have autism or Asperger's, this is not the book to coax you out of yourself. This isn't to say it's of no use to an introverted person, but using the techniques advocated will be more of a challenge."
5,And I still dont have any friends...WTF??? lol,Just kidding. This is a real informative book and Im glad I read it. Now to try and see if the suggestions work is a whole other story. Ill update on that later. But the ideas are laid out to where you can simply try them. The book layout is actually one of the better ones Ive seen of late. The stories that are told throughout the book help you understand how to use the suggestions on your own. Its a good book. Give it a try....
3,Advice for the bit out of date,"I understand a lot of people see this book as a standard in psychology and dealing with people, but I'm about two chapters in and a lot of the information and anecdotes especially strike me in a very out-of-date way. I'm looking for a progressive book with new ideas and things I haven't heard before.Perhaps I'm in a generation where this book has influenced more than I know that I feel like I've heard all of this before, through different things like blogs, other books, or movies. References to WWI, steel producing companies and the Civil War era might have some interesting ideas to get across, but I think in order to win friends and influence people in the modern age depends on ideas that have finally overtaken things found in this book.I'll be trying to get through it, but so far, I'm immediately just not excited about it."
5,Human relationship skills that stand the test of time,"I love this book. I read it 20 years ago and still use many of the ideas. Nowadays, I am most excited by Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self and Crucial Conversations. Optimal Thinking shows you how to be your best no matter how difficult the situation. If you are facing an abusive person, a passive-aggressive, or any conflict, you learn how to be your best. Crucial Conversations shows you how to deal with difficult conversations. Buy and read these three books!"
2,"Super old version, didn't even open",The one I purchased looks nothing like the picture but looks like it was made in 1800. I didn't even open it up.
4,great,"This is a great, simple book. It states the objective, gives personal stories on how that virtue was learned and put to use, and then goes on to the next virtue. A must read for anyone who wants to interact with anyone."
3,Interesting book,We dont realize that many people want the same things that we do.I purchased this book to become more social. I have learned more than I expected.
4,Off you go ...,"If ever there was a book that didn't need recommending, its title is How to Win Friends & Influence People. Simply put, if you haven't read this book by now then this review, which baits the question ""Why not?"", will hopefully change that fact.How often do you get to read something from over 70 years ago and find it relevant to your life today? How to Win Friends & Influence People is the single best source of help (next to the Big Book for many) to those seeking direction in their lives. Dale Carnegie quotes one famous psychologist from the 1930's as saying, ""It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals all human failures spring.""Take the tangible directions from this guide to success and transform your life, and the lives of all around you. Off you go ...Any questions? ;-)Thank you Dale CarnegieM. Frank Johnson724-MFJ-LABSlinkedin/in/MFJLabs"
5,How to win friends and influence people,"This is a great book,I can see why it's been around for 70 years!!!!I highly recommend buying this book. Everyone can benefit from this book!!!EVERYONE!!!!"
2,A big rip off,"First off, this CD isn't professionally made. You can tell cause the side with the music on it is blue like a CD-R. You don't get the full version of these songs only enough to tease you. Some of these songs are so rare and hard to find that it's necessary to find the full 12"" version. So if you're looking for the full version so you can make your own mix, don't buy this CD. But if you're into mix CD's with old school music, then this is for you."
2,Good...AT FIRST!,"Like some of the other reviews I also have had the problem of the loud POP sounds and loss of audio after 2 years of ownership. I have been told that it is the capacitors going bad on the board inside the bass module. Because all of the components run from this board- if the board goes bad your sunk. I am currently trying to get it fixed. The system sounded great for 2 years and I was very happy with it, but in the long run you get what you pay for. Cheap system, short lifespan."
5,Great Theatre System,"This home theatre system is great. I have had no problems whatsoever with it. Installation was a breeze, as well as learning how to use it... Definately 5 stars from me!!!!!"
5,A Great Deal for Your Money,This is the best Home Theater System of it's class. I highly recommend It!!!
5,Whats the name of that song?,Does anyone know the name of the song that is playing in the beginning of the movie when The Rock is beating up the football players in the club?
5,Great Mix of music....,"I was very pleased with the score to The Rundown. I bought it on a whim, and I was sure glad I did. The great thing about this album, is that you can leave it on at a party, its great background music. Gregson-Williams seems to take a bit from differnet music styles, electronica, kumbia, and traditional strings to make it a solid album. My one complaint is the lack of more of track one. Let me explain, track one, Coming Down, starts off fierce with a hypnotic electonica beat, unfortunately this beat only lasts a minute at the most. I would have liked to hear more of this beat as the theme for The Rundown.Great score, its good driving music and great to listen to at the end of a stressful day."
5,"Beautiful, Open, Honest, In touch With Our Deepest Spirit","This is the kind of book they should have requried us to read in school, a book of truth, a true heart speaks and tells its story. If in this day we must grow away from the tradition of ""education"" to find such truths and pearls of wisdom, so be it. Let us grow, let us learn the bigger world, the bigger picture of who we are with the universe. Let us learn to be just and kind and understanding to all. Very straightforward. Very inspiring. As you follow the simplicity deeper worlds open. A priceless book."
4,"it is very nice,",iam bashar and i like very much darren hayes and his wonderfull song { instiable} and i wish to darren hayes to be the first singer in the world.
5,Deep Soul,Issac Hayes did his thiing with his powerful rendition of I Stand Accused. This is a powerful soul album. A must have to any soul collection.
2,"Nice, but there's better.","I know I probabaly shouldn't expect so much for the good deal that I got, but the MX3900D was a major disappointment.I have had problems since day one with the sound levels while playing DVD's. When I have the radio turned on I can keep the level at about a 5 or a 6 and hear it through my whole house. For a DVD I have to turn the level to 25 or 30 to barely hear common conversations. It is also really irratating that when I put a new DVD in the changer and then select that tray that the DVD doesn't automatically start playing. Isn't that the point of the DVD menu that movie companies put on the disc?? I even went so far as calling Philips to find out about the problems and was told that these are known issues and can't be fixed.Sorry, but I want a system that I don't have to crank all the the way so that I can hear my movie. This one went back to the store."
5,A Treasury of Fun!,"What a find! This book is a great source of ideas and tools for projects that the whole family can enjoy. Even though the ideas are geared toward 6-12 year olds (I have a 3 year old) some can be adapted for younger children. Homeschoolers especially would like this book for its educational slant (filled with projects related to science, nature, and art). Fun fun fun!"
5,Great music,The soundtrack to this film is very good. Invokes the time and places but you should see the film first so then when youlisten to the soundtrack the music will have much more meaning.
1,Not recommended,"Oi vey! What an odd book. If you enjoy talking to yourself and shouting at the top of your voice for a few hours a day, then this book is for you.It's not about mental toughness, it's about screaming affirmations, ""with feeling behind it.""Please don't buy this!"
1,Obnoxious,"Another is a long line of obnoxious self-help books. If you carefully read the other reviews you will notice that they are susiciously similar to other authors pawning the same guru mentality. I would suggest that instead of buying this book you keep your money in your purse or wallet and I can then assure you that you have successfully completed the first stage of true ""mental toughness"" although if you are having trouble sleeping I do recommend pages 1-2 of this book."
4,Go Ahead John!,"OK, this is not just a showcase for John McLaughlin but he is heavily featured and the most interesting player on it next to Miles. Like the In a Silent Way box, this does have the ""as played"" bits that the final mixes of the two tunes on the original Tribute to Jack Johnson album (""Right Off"" & ""Yesternow"") were assembled from, as well as the final mixes. It also has the ""as played"" versions of ""Go Ahead John"" but not the final mix, to get that you still need Big Fun. And yes there are a lot alternate takes in a row, six of ""Willie Nelson"". But it does have a lot of previously unheard Miles, John McL and even some v. out there Sonny Sharrock. This is probably Miles most rock-ish period but if you're into that, as I am, then there's lots to dig here and lots of it isn't available anywhere else and may never be."
5,Great Story and Wonderful spiritual strength for a young girl!,I LOVE this story and the whole outlook this young girl has on life. She is a great LIVING example of a strong Christian. Wish I had the opportunity to meet her personally.
5,This is my favorite book I've ever read!,"Gianna is not only a novel, but filled with tons of really helpful information. I've read this book several times in the few years I've had it and even loaded it to my (pro-choice) health teacher while we were doing the abortion unit. Gianna has motivated me to stand for what I believe in, life in any situation! I'm now involved in an organization where we stand in front of Planned Parenthood and quitely pray for the girls(and guys )who go in there. What an awesome opportunity and outreach it is! I couldn't reccomend this book more!"
4,"A book about forgiveness, love, and determination","This book doesn't contain the best writing I've ever seen, but it still tells the story of a remarkable young woman. Obviously, the abortion doctor's name could not be used for legal reasons, but the documents that came to Gianna's adoptive mother, combined with the ""from the horse's mouth"" information from Gianna's birth mother are all the evidence that a reasonable person could expect to find in a situation such as this.But Gianna's story isn't just about whether abortion is the killing of a human being or not; a great deal of her story is about forgiveness, love, and determination.Gianna is an inspiration because she's a survivor, because she's not afraid to speak her mind, and because she ""walks the walk,"" in addition to ""talking the talk.""Definitely worth reading."
1,Beyond the Laughter: A Daughters Story,"I'm a long time Stooge fan and a fairly good authority on facets of their life and career. I'm also a mental health professional and can comfortably say that the person(s) who wrote this tawdry attempt at sensationalism are severly personality disordered. None of this stands up to even the most elementary evaluation. I suppose the ""revealing of proof"" promised ""when the time is right"" will also discuss the ""lost"" stooges movie made at Roswel, New Mexico where the Stooges are the doctors who botch the ailien autopsy. Shame on the the perpetrators and supporters of this garbage for not having the consience to make an honest living but rather trying to cash in on a fabrication."
1,Here's a Problem....,"The book states that Curly was never a member of the Howard family. Why then, is Curly's grave located directly behind the grave of Sol and Jenny Horowitz, even though the other stooges are buried in other cemetaries? This seems more than unusual for someone who was not a member of the family. Furthermore, with a simple internet search, you can see photographs of his grave, as well as photos of his death certificate. There is no evidence at all to prove that anything in this book ever happened. To accept it all as fact is pure stupidity."
2,Nonfiction or Novel?,"Check out the publisher's website (iuniverse.com). They describe this book as ""a novel based on fact"". Webster's Dictionary defines a novel as ""a fictitious prose narrative of considerable length"". The publisher's description falls short of true non-fiction, and implies significant artistic license at work. Indeed, it is extremely unlikely that events prior to Jackie's birth would be related with such extensive detail. Sorry folks, the book is certainly entertaining, but there isn't a shred of proof to support any of it, and even the publisher is careful in how they describe it."
1,Beyond the Laughter.. A Daughter's Story,"I threw this book in the trash after a few chapters because it is not as it would appear. It is a complete fabrication, representing itself as a story about Curly Howard. To begin, Curly's name was Jerome Lester Horwitz, not Glissen. He did not go by Curly, but by Jerry or ""Babe"". Since he was Jewish, why would he need the Pope to annul his marraige to a non-catholic? The author tries to tie him to events in the late 1950's that lead up to the death of President Kennedy. Curly died January 18, 1952 of complications of a stroke that he suffered in 1946.I suggest that anyone looking for a story based in truth stay away from this book. I wish I had known before buying it that it was a falsehood. I feel mislead and cheated and that I had never wasted my money."
4,One of the truly-original artists in latin america.,"I'ts not just a feeling it's the lyrical content, the musical cross-rock-pop-latin rhythms balance that elevate Shakira's particular vocals (a kind of beautiful latin Sinnead O'Connor's texture). Shakira is not an artificial lab created star,she really comes from the heart. She deserves America's recognition. Hope she'll sing in english very soon. She could be pop-rock Estefan's version. But unique and beautiful."
5,Great introduction to Latin Music,"This album awakened my senses-- especially about Latin music. For all of you who are tired of translated material, this is the album to buy. I serves as a great introduction to the wonderful sounds of Spanish-sung music. Covering everything from love/lust, obsession, regret, to politics and fictional adventure, these lyrics will certainly abate your boredom. The beat is rhythmic and danceable but retains a level of intellect via its poetic lyrics. It's surely a great balance of dance, ballads, and most of all poesy that apply to everyone. You'll surely press the repeat button more than once; never boring, the album offers a great escape from the banalities of the American ""Diva"" craze and the repetitive themes of Alanis-style ""rock."" Amazing work for such a young woman-- she wrote the music, the lyrics, AND co-produced this unforgettable album. Truly a testament to the fact that Latin music is a thriving force. Buy it NOW!!"
4,Shakira is the Real Thing!,"I scoff at those who say Shakira is the Latin Alanis Morrisette! I think she is the Latin combo of Ani DiFranco and Tori Amos. Her beautiful big voice and incredible rythyms explain why Latin music is making it big in the US. She makes sell-outs like Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias look like wanna-bes, while she is the real thing! This is the one CD that both my friend and I brought back from living simultaneously in Latin America, I in Mexico and her in Chile, it hasn't left our CD players since! Discover Latin America's sensational secret!"
4,Don't Be Sordomuda!,"Shakira's second studio album is much better than many even can think. It has great Spanish lyrics. It's great to hear music in other languages - than just English. Shakira had a beautiful and great voice even during this album - and you can hear her great songs like ""Ojos Asi"", ""Ciega, Sordomuda"", ""Si Te Vas"", ""no Creo"", ""Inevitable"", and ""Tú"" from this album. Those all are classic songs. The only song in this album that doesn't make me happy is ""Sombra de Ti"" which is so boring. Still, I'm very glad that I bought this album - still, after years this is great to listen to.Stars: Ojos Asi, Ciega, Sordomuda, Inevitable"
5,Shakira at her best,"In my opinion, this is Shakira's best album by far.The album is an amazing work of art. The composition is beautiful, the lyrics are original and moving, and Shakira's voice is superb.One of the best latin rock/pop albums of all time."
4,It's Alright,"This CD is ok but nothing I would rave about. The versions of Tu, No Creo, Donde Estan Los Ladrones, and Octavio Dia sound a lot better on the MTV Unplugged album. I'd recommend you buy Unplugged so you can hear the difference between these songs."
5,This one of the best Spanish CDs ever!!!!,This CD is one of the best fusions of rock and pop in Spanish.It has haunting melodies for the slow songs and strong beats for the faster songs.
1,Stopped working after only a few months,"I really liked this little CD player. It was cheap, and worked well at beginning. After about 3 months, it would no longer play CD's anymore. Very disappointing. Maybe one day I will learn you get what you pay for. Low price=low quality."
4,good for young kids,"the price is right. it is very small and light weight, and simple and good enough for young kids. (5~10 years old)"
5,A must read for everyone.,"A truly inspired masterpiece. The life of Jesus has been beaten down over the ages by those who portray him as a sad, lonely and forlorn man; but in reality he must have been a most charismatic man full of courage, warmth, laughter, and life - the kind of man every one wants to be around. The author makes his points powerfully forever changing the way I look at Jesus and his life. This book is a must read. I am so glad I came across the book. I promise you will not be disappointed. It is interesting, enlightening, well written, and inspirational; and, it is an easy read. You will be glad you did."
5,An All Out Attack ON Political Correctness,This is high octane stuff and not for the faint of heart. Ms. Fallaci pulls no punches.
5,Fabulous,"I read everything I can get my hands on about Marie Antoinette, and this was the best biography of her. Well-written, entertaining, objective, I could go on and on. Really a pleasure. The account of the flight to Varennes was so suspenseful, even though we all know the outcome."
3,"good resource, beginners beware.","As mentioned by other reviewers, this book is not a step-by-step instruction manual. If you are a beginner, this series of books isn't nearly as helpful as the ""How to Draw Anime and Game Characters"" 5 book series which will provide you with a basic foundation to work with.If you are past the beginner stage, it is an excellent reference with some good pointers and tons of information on Japanese mythology.The only major complaint with this book is the English isn't clear sometimes and there are numerous grammatical errors. There are a few instances in which ideas just aren't communicated clearly.Although I must say I was generally disappointed when I received this book, I do find it to be a useful resource and I will definitely be hanging out to it."
4,Quite a nice reference book for Monster and Yokai fans,Good reference book for artists interested in Halloween Monsters and Yokai (Classic Japanese Monsters like Tengu and Kappa) from a manga (Japanese comics) perspective. It is a fairly nice encyclopedia packed with drawing pointers and quick descriptions of several Eastern and Western creatures of the night and even the brave souls that hunt and exorcise them. Fun read coupled with some manga techniques on how to render supernatural powers and create a spooky mood. Recommended addition for budding manga artists.
2,Doesn't hold up well,"I don't care how much people praise this film, it doesn't deliver and I turned if off half way thru. In my opinion Peckinpah is a hack, just look at that dog Straw Dogs, pointless as well. This movie plods along,framed by the dichotomy of two old friends that are now enemies. Most of the dialogue is no better than a tv western program. Booze, whores, and wanton violence film up the scenes. Some of the cinematography and editing is abrupt and does add a jarring feel to the movie, which isn't bad. However, overall, there is little of value that is transmitted, and it turns out to be another prosaic Peckin' offering. This movie can't hold a candle to Stagecoach or The Searchers. 'Nuff said."
5,Great item,"I have used this item since December 2007. It is a quality turntable and works very very well, I am in the process of converting approx. 500 Lp and about the same 45s to MP3 format, I have had no issues with this or the software that came with it.Only slightly negative is that I wish the Labeling portion of the software had Lightscribe support."
4,More real than the movie ever could be,"I read the 1949 edition of this book, and in doing so I got to share in Maria's heart, her mind, her faith, her family. I feel as if I know them all! Too bad the movie didn't come even close to being as real as this true story. I can't help but feel like America was fed a fluff story of little substance with ""The Sound of Music"", and too bad everyone knows the stars but not the real Trapps! May the remaining original Trapps be blessed and honored, wherever they may be living out their years."
3,A Shadow of its former self,"I was very disappointed with this album. Although, Clooney still has a lot of style, her voice is a shadow of its former self. She can't hold notes but knows how to disguise her imperfections. The Basie orchestra is amazing and the musical arrangements are great. It is almost worthwhile to buy this album for the orchestrations alone, but not quite."
5,Sunterra Pond Filter,This is an excellent filter that is easy to install and maintain. It cleared my pond within a few days and it now stays crystal clear.
1,Sudo-bark,My word these are terrible. Do people really eat these? Each crunchy bite is a sudden new burst of bland and disgusting. I think the only reason these things don't go bad is because even bacteria find them unpalatable.
2,Wendy Carlos - 'Tales Of Heaven & Hell' (East Side Digital),"As HARD as I really tried to get into this work by composer Wendy Carlos,I simply could not. 'Tales Of...' is JUST too strange. Just call the music on this CD 'weird electronic'.Liked the reissue for the 'Clockwork Orange' movie soundtrack SO much better(see my review). It's obvious that the music here is classically influenced.Two cuts here I thought were so-so are ""Transitional"" and ""City Of Temptation"". Seven tracks,duration is 57:27. I mean if you enjoy several of Carlos's other releases,you get nearly a full hour of true oddness here. Just might appeal to patient fans of Tomita,Kraftwerk,Mother Mallard's Portable Masterpiece Co. and Carl Craig."
1,POS,"Well it's true that most reviews tend to be a few mad people that go online to rant about their broken stuff, but it's pretty obvious from all the similar posts that there are serious flaws in the longevity of this tv. Misery loves company and I too feel a little comfort in finding out that our dead tv wasn't a fluke. Yes the high pitch whine was tolerable, but after 2 years it has died with the same symptoms that everyone else has had - the random shut off with increasing frequency, the clicking relay sound, and now permanent death. I had purchased a similar priced / spec samsung a few years earlier and it's still alive and kicking at my parent's house. I wish we had given them the philips and lugged my older samsung cross country instead... We've recently went the HD route and bought a big flat screen vizio since I'm never buying a philips magnabox again! The people with a few good reviews were either really lucky or they work for philips..."
2,a disappointment after Cat's Cradle and other masterpieces,"Written in 1970 or so, I think this one is a good example of how opinionated people really need to disguise their personal opinions better in order to keep a story interesting. That doesn't mean you can't express your opinion; you just have to be subtle about it. Vonnegut is better at this in some of his other writing.One of the characters is a one-dimensional brute (possibly based on Ernest Hemingway) who treats his wife and son as things and has filled his house with taxedermised animals he has killed. The other characters are similarly simplistic, and the plot is even weaker. In fact, it's difficult to believe that the same person who wrote this play is also the author of such classic literature as Cat's Cradle."
2,You'll need supplementary commentary,"The poetry itself is wonderful, but the commentary is rarely helpful. Campbell wastes many pages pointing out Homeric allusions and similar passages in the works of other authors which, while interesting, does little to help students with difficult vocabulary and grammar."
3,A Little Love From The Brothers Gibb,"The Bee Gees latest compilation, Love Songs, gathers together eighteen songs that are ballads by nature. There is nothing new here and basically after track eight, there is nothing but filler and bad songs like versions of ""Islands In The Stream"", ""Heartbreaker"" and ""Emotion"" which are far outstripped by the versions the band produced for others. But the first eight songs show why the Bee Gees are members of the Rock & Roll Hall Fame. Big hits like ""To Love Somebody"", ""How Can You Mend A Broken Heart"", the lush and gorgeous ""How Deep Is Love"" and the haunting ""Lonely Days"" and less known singles like ""First Of May"" from the criminally overlooked Odessa album are justifiable classics."
1,Cheap Plastic Release Mechanism,"PROS: The blades seem to be of a nice quality stainless steel.NEG: The plastic release mechanism is super cheap and flimsy. I'm nervous about touching it for fear it will break. I sure wouldn't want this in a survival kit or have to depend on it in the woods. The rest of the plastic on the knife looks like it would crack easily. I'm sure in years past these were a good quality knife. But alas, no more..... Which is too bad, because I really like the design and size of the knife. I will be returning this to Amazon.After I received the knife I went to a local sporting goods store and saw a VICTORINOX SPARTAN and a TINKER. They didn't have the cheap plastic release mechanism like the HUNTER. The red plastic case seemed better as well. I've decided to reorder a different Victorinx knife, either a Spartan, Tinker or the Army Huntsman. I look forward to giving that knife a positive review when I receive it."
2,Large blade swings closed very quickly - had to get stitches,"While it might some idiotic, I actually cut myself very badly while using this Swiss Army Hunter. The large blade is great when it is in the open position but when you close the blade it is quite forceful. If you are not careful it will swing back and put a nice deep gash in your left index finger. Basically you have to ensure that you have a good grip on the large blade while closing it. I much prefer Leatherman or Gerber multi tools that have the feature of just ""push"" closing. Other than the large blade swing back, the rest of the tools are great."
2,EMPTY DVD BOX! NO MOVIE INSIDE!,"My daughter opened up some presents just shortly after midnight on Christmas Day. One of them was the DVD I ordered called ""James and the Giant Peach"". The DVD box did NOT contain the DVD, it was just an empty box. We are very disappointed with this and will not be ordering from Amazon anymore. This product was sold as NEW (which obviously is a complete lie). BUYER BEWARE!!!!!! DON'T TRUST THE WORD ""NEW"" ON ANYTHING ON THIS SITE."
3,Not my favorite by Burton,"Interesting movie and even held my three-year-old's interest. However, I didn't feel very attached the characters. I just don't think it's one of Burton's best."
1,DVD - Horrible. Scratched and skips. VERY used.,Horrible quality item and it is unbelievable they would send this. It was scratched and skips. The DVD was VERY used.
4,James and the Giant Peach,My twin daughter read the book in school and she enjoyed the book so much that she asked me to buy the dvd and the movie was about as good as the book according to her I enjoyed the movie too!!
4,a good book also,"this is a very sorowful tale of horrible women who mistreat a small child called james.he finds some magic ..........mmmmmmmm.............somethings which effect whatever they touch magicly.eventualy it turns a peach into a giant peach.james gets into it and rides with some bugs across the sea from london to new york.it is animated so no stars again.it is very sad at the beginning,but picks up so some children may get worked up.tim burton is in charge again,so it is a gem.it is one of his best works.the 2evil chicks at the start are terrible and have no real place in a childrens movie.the book is excellent also.our teacher read it to us in the 5th grade.this one is great!"
2,Weird and creepy,It was weird and creepy. The story line was kind of disjointed. My 5 yr old son will watch movies we rent over and over until the rental expires. He never asked to watch this again.
4,Pimsleur is the best,"I have tried other methods and for me, the Pimsleur method was the easiest to grasp. I love working with it."
2,didnt like it,This is so slow! I felt like a 5 year old kid while listening to the lessons. They just repeat the same words and phrases over and over again. If you have any basic knowledge of the language this is going to be very boring!
2,Not Worth The Price,I love the Sims and bought the holiday add on and paid less than 15.00 for it. I was shocked at the lack of objects included. There are maybe 40 items. The wall paper and floors are not worth the price I paid. The version here has the sims 2 included and I can tell you the price is to high. I hope this isn't the way the Sims will go in the future. I have really enjoyed all the games up until this X-Mas Rip off.
5,If it is an expansion pack it will say expansion pack,"I am not sure why some people are so upset about how this version of the Sims 2 was marketed. As with all the Sims expansion packs it will say ""expansion pack"" on the box or in the title if that is what it is. This version does not call itself an expansion pack so why would you assume it was? It clearly says it's the Sims 2 Holiday Edition and pretty much says it's the original Sims 2 with extra Christmas and Holiday stuff on it. The expansion packs all have the Sims 2 listed under system requirments - this does not... just another clue that it's not an expansion pack. And last - the price should tell you right away it's the entire Sims 2 game. The Sims 2 is one of the coolest games and gets great ratings. (take a look at the ratings under the regular Sims 2 to get an idea) Some of these folks give it a low rating because they didn't pay attention to what they were buying. Rate the game and not your common sense."
4,Love the game - hate the quick expensive add on!,"The sims are trying to cash in what all of the SIM website has been doing for years. They should have just offered these on their website for free to download. There is really no ""changes"" to your sims just they now have some décor they can add to the house, it is the SIMS2 Packed Different. You might just want to find a website that you can go to and download for a small fee or free. There are some SIM artists on the web who created better holiday things too. This was a quick how can we make money for this holiday? At least that is how it feels to me.The way it was marketed was like a NEW ADD ON, not the full game. I already had the full game. It just still seems like a joke. But I guess there are some suckers out there.***************MY FAMILY who doesn't play wouldn't know the difference and think they were getting me the greatest thing ever for the holiday!!***************VERY DISAPPOINTED."
4,Bought as a gift,"This product was purchased as a gift, and the recipient seems pleased with it. Even though it is an older game, it installed perfectly and plays well on a new computer."
4,In and Out ...and In Again With Familiar Territory,"Finally, after many years, a Patti Austin album that comes close to her popular r&b, dance music status that most of her fans enjoyed with Gettin' Away With Murder back in '85! In & Out of Love is a more up-to-date version of Gettin' Away With Murder for the late 90's. For anyone interested in Patti Austin's albums I highly recommend these four : Every Home Should Have One, Patti Austin-self-titled, Gettin' Away With Murder, and the most recent In and Out of Love. Skip the GRP period under which she was contracted in the early 90's- they were nothing more than late night light-listening watered-down jazz albums; However, her voice was superb as ever ! In and Out of Love gets 4 stars (there may be way too many slow ballads for some people--however, there's also a good supply of smooth grooves) !!!"
3,Good for time and distance,This device is great at giving time and distance. However I often found the pace times to be a little off. I also had trouble getiing a strong signal. The computer software included is great it allows you to look at past workouts very easily and displays everything in an easy to read format on your computer. It also saves all of you workouts.
1,Doesn't work in the shade!,"I received a Forerunner 201 for my birthday in August. I have used it about a dozen times with worthless results. It only registered accurately on one run and that was when I altered my course to run in the open (in the hot sun). It is very easily tripped up by any shade which is where people should be running. Hopefully, this will improve when the leaves fall.Also, I was disappointed by the computer interface which only works with a COM port. These have been obsolete for years and an adapter to a USB port is quite pricey. Garmin shouldn't be selling obsolete technology. Even my older computer bought four years ago doesn't have a COM port.If you are interested in buying one of these, I would suggest you find somebody in your area who uses one to see if ir works with your local topography. If you like running in the woods, forget about it."
3,not as wonderful as I had hoped,"This device is great when it works. It frequently has difficulty picking up a signal (you must be at the top of a hill)and occasionally stops tracking/timing (reasons unknown). If you are walking or running in the woods or on a tree-lined street, forget it. Battery charging and life is excellent."
1,the purchase was a mistake,I bought the Garmin Forerunner 201 thinking that I could use it in the UK . Unfortunately it doesn't work here ... I'm a bit surprised that there wasn't any warning about not being able to work outside the USA.I would like to return it if possible .
4,Garmin Forerunner 201 Review,"Compared to a pedometer the Garmin 201 is my preference. However, I question the accuracy of my running distances compared to the GPS results. I run the same quarter mile course everyday, 5 days a week and after 1 mile (4 laps) my GPS makes me suspect its accuracy is inconsistent because mile 2 is shorter than mile 1 and by the time I've covered 4 miles I've run 15 laps instead of 16. Being a cross country coach for 20 years, I've measured and remeasured courses using a measuring wheel. I have measured & remeasured my laps with the wheel over the years and I stand by the wheel results--16 laps equals 4 miles.I also use the GPS for determining the miles we walk in a walking class I teach at San Diego City Community College. I question the accuracy of the miles we cover since we do walk downtown (tall buildings)and through Balboa Park (lots of trees)which causes an occasional weak signal.Overall, the GPS does do better than a pedometer which grossly underestimates mileage!"
4,Garmin Forerunner 201 GPS,"Accurate and waterproof, I use this GPS to clock my speeds when kayaking in high current areas. Rechargeable battery lasts about 13 - 15 hours and recharges quickly."
2,Just doesn't work very well,"Trust me, do not waste your money on this technology. I've been running for over 20 years, all distance, so I have a fair idea of pace.The Gramin would bounce all over the place with pace speed. I want to be able to look down, see my pace and keep going. Whether in open areas or slight tree coverage, data wasn't reliable. We'd be running at about a 8 minute pace, I'd look down and see 8:45, minute later, it was 8:15, then 8.Did not get to the track to play with as we running early AM and it's dark. I got the unit for $99.00 which is a great price, but sent it back three weeks later.I'll wait another year or so until they refine the technology. I do have a standard GPS which works OK, but arm mount units just aren't reliable."
3,Garmin Forerunner 201,"Worked well in wide open spaces but easily lost GPS signal if running on trails or in city. Also, battery stopped charging after 11 months. Would've expected more longevity but not a bad product for someone trying a GPS for the first time."
5,Excellent,"The product was described as 'New"" and it was. It came in it's original packaging and all papers were included. It came within the time stated and works great! Thanks so much!"
3,Forerunner 201,"Overall I'm happy with the product, as it's great to have a device that I can use to time my runs (I don't have a watch with a timer on it). However, it sometimes takes quite awhile to link up with the satellite, so the pace and mileage aren't as accurate as they could be. Also, there's a weak GPS signal more than I'd like, which also conflicts with pace and mileage. This is a great product if you run only in very open areas with nothing that could conflict with the GPS signal."
4,It grows on you,"Not as good as the first album, but I've found that if you listen to it a couple times it really grows on you. The more I listen to it, the more I love it. You can't always depend on first impressions. I'm still not sure about those horns though."
4,Love It,"I bought this CD on the first day released because I have been a die hard fan since I heard ""Push"" on the radio. At first listen I wasn't to sure if I liked it or not, but after a few listens the songs grew on me. It isn't much like the first album, but I feel they've matured as a band and Rob still has the sexiest voice alive."
4,I drove my boss crazy,"Listening to this cd over and over in my computer's cd player. I got this CD today on my lunch break. I am in love with it. ""Bent"" is my favorite song so far,,, and wait until you see the cd's package. You'll fall out. Its awesome. Worth buying. Its so emotional. Its gorgeous. Okay thats my 5 cents."
3,"Sophomore Effort, and What Did You Expect?","I'm neither a raving fan of this, nor hugely disappointed. I always remember that a band's first major label release is a compilation of everything that works really well, and that they've been crafting for a long time. The second always has that panicky feel -- not to mention the ""Er, exactly who are we?"" feeling.I originally liked this band because they have a similar sound to Counting Crows (Rob Thomas' voice has more body and less whine), and reasonable lyrics (Adam Duritz is by far the better lyricist). This album has some good lines - since I'm pretty verbally focused, that's a relief.My biggest complaint is that this thing is over-produced. Whose idea was it to pour the syrupy strings and horns all over this album? Does anyone know how I go about scrubbing them off and figuring out how this album really sounds?"
5,Do these guys no anything that ISN'T good?,"Got the C.D. the day it came out, and can't get enough of it. It's a combination of their traditional style as well as a fresh new sound. All new songs, all wonderful! Highly reccomnded!"
5,Great Softrock,"If you are into softrock you will probably like Matchbox 20's 2nd CD, Mad Season. I have listened to a few songs from their first album (Yourself or Someone Like You), and this album is similar, but it does have a different sound. Mad Season is a tad softer than the previous, so people who like hard rock should look somewhere else. This is definitely NOT a hardrock album. The new sound can best be described as softrock with a bit of jazz/blues put in for good measure (don't worry, it isn't pop). I personally love it, but listen to the samples before buying because it is different than Yourself or Someone Like You.Softrock lovers--go get it now! You probably won't be disappointed."
4,Great CD!,"If you like matchbox 20's other stuff or Rob Thomas, you'll love this! Its a really great CD. It has a little of everything!"
3,"Good, but not as great as Yourself or someone like you","ok. Mad Season was actually the first Matchbox 20 album that i bought. I loved Bent, and If you're gone- the reasons why i bought MS. I think the album as a whole is good. One day my friend gave me the first M20 album- Yourself or Someone like you- because they knew that i had the second album. When Yourself or Someone like you came out, i didn't particularly care for their style (Push, and 3 A.m. aggrevated me). But, i decided since i liked MS, i would give this album another try. OMG- i loved it! I think this album shows alot more emotion, Rob's singing is awesome, the melodies are great, the songs don't sound the same...i just loved it. I definetly think that the first album is much, MUCH better than Mad Season. For those of you who only have the second album, GO GET THE FIRST ONE! it's awesome. and for those of you who have the first (and love it) and want to go out and get the second one, don't expect anything great."
3,Different...,"The last matchbox 20 cd was pretty good - with songs like ""hang"" and ""kody"". But on this album, they've almost abandoned their past. You won't find many acoustic ballads or even anything close to it on this cd, rather, more horn-driven rock. I'm disappointed that I bought this album because I expected something more along what their last album sounded like."
2,Disappointing follow-up,"I liked Matchbox Twenty's last album (when they were called Matchbox 20 instead) because it was filled with catchy pop tunes and Rob Thomas' interesting vocal sound. While Mr. Thomas' voice remains, the catchy pop tunes are gone. It's a bland, rather lifeless collection of pop songs that try too hard to be more serious and weighty than the songs from the previous album."
1,HyperCD format does NOT work,"This CD is in HyperCD format. I ordered one, returned it...ordered again and same thing! This is a decade old format and it won't run without an internet connection! defeats the purpose of getting a CD.....just trash!"
1,Mindless,"If you want mindless, prefab drivel. Then by all means, buy a Matchbox 20 CD. But if you want better music than Matchbox 20, buy anything else, no matter what it is, as long as it is original. This CD is not original, not groundbreaking, not talented, not awe-inspiring, nothing more than easy to write, prefebricated, mass produced, pop music with a buffed up shine and an attractive singer. Backstreet Boys with guitars. If thats what you want, you could even do better than Matchbox 20, trust me, just keep looking."
3,Average......,"I have listened to ""Mad Season""....I think it's ok.. but...I do like ""Yourself or someone like you"" better. There are a few songs on this new album that are catchy...but their still not as good as the songs on the first album. I would recommend buying this album if you are a Matchbox Twenty fan, and if your not..wait to see if any of these songs make it to radio...Then decide"
2,BEWARE: BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK,"I believe that matchbox Twenty should be grateful I give this 2 stars. I would give it one but I find their first album to be a classic, so I give them another star for having potential. Beware of this album still. Every song from the first song to the last song sounds the same. I liked about 2 songs on this album and that's it. I expected so much from this album but was disappointed to find out I bought a CD that belongs to be broken into many little pieces, and then into smaller pieces. Next time, matchbox Twenty, make a good album. This album will be collecting dust while I wait for your next CD."
5,How Can You Turn Down This CD!!!,"If you allow yourself to buy one CD this year, this is IT!!! There is no doubt that Rob Thomas' lyrics fit everysong and kept the beat going throughout the whole CD. Not only do they have the great songs heard on the radio, If You're Gone, Mad Season, and Bent, but some other great songs, and Angry and Black & White People are so good that this CD would add at least 6 songs to the radio list top 30. Everyone who has ever loved someone will relate, and LOVE this CD!!! A must buy......the money is WORTH IT!!!"
3,After a couple of months.....,"you'll probably never listen to this album again. All the songs are your typical rock cliches that anyone can write. Of course, predictablity in songwriting makes the listener amused at first, feeling the songs are real nice. The real truth is uncovered after a couple of listens though. Songs like 'Bent', 'B&W people', 'If you're gone' sound marvellous for sometime, then you just cant help really getting bored of them. I gave the 3 stars to the song Mad season though, which is one of the two cuts that are worth buying this album for (w/ Rest Stop). I think you'd better avoid this if you're not a fan."
5,Excellent,"For all Matchbox 20 fans, you won't be disappointed! It is reminiscent of their previous CD but with a lot of new flare. I am truly enjoying it!"
2,An Awesome Package but a Madly Disenchanting Album,"I had the Yourself or Someone Like You Album for about 2 years before Matchbox 20 became popular. I drove my friends crazy talking about how they were so wonderful. I loved the distinct sound of Rob Thomas's lead vocals. I was thrilled to hear that Matchbox 20 was coming out with a new album and pre-ordered it a month and a half ahead of time. When I got the album I was extremely diappointed! Aside from the song ""Bent"", it seemed like I was listening to a different group. They have added new instruments and are much more subdued. I wish I would have waited to listen to someone else's copy of this c.d. before I purchased it."
3,"GOOD, BUT DOES NOT COMPAIR TO FIRST ALBUM","Matchbox is truly a talented and wonderful band. They are extremely creative and they know how to express thoughts through their music. Matchbox 20's first album was an amazing album which had great music in all of the songs. This album however had its share of good and disappointing songs. The songs seem more simple and rushed, and they seem to not have that ""WOW"" expression that I got with their first album. Overall, I wouldn't say that this album is dissapointing, but simply different. Give it a chance!"
3,Disappointment,"I am sorry. ""Yourself or Someone Like You"" was unbelievable. ""Smooth"" was great. The guys had us fooled w/ ""Bent"". This album is too dark and slow. They need to go back to their old ways."
4,Some Great Songs!,"Matchbox Twenty has always been a favorite of mine, and this CD just made me love them more! I did disagree with some songs, but the rest of them are made with Matchbox Twenty's soft, slow, and individual quality. Matchbox never seems to let us down, and this CD is proof of that:) Rob Thomas's(lead singer) voice goes from different levels of volume and feeling, just to get to you, the listener's, inner feelings. Mad Season is a great example of this. However, in spite all of this, I gave it a 4 star review since not all the songs were able to reach me on a more personal level. I still love and always will love Matchbox, but it did not reach my 5 star ""requirements""."
2,A huge disappointment for this Matchbox 20 fan,"Mad Season sounds like a rushed effort to me and a mediocre album at best. Some of the songs are good, but not great and some sound like they belong on an ""easy listening"" station. Even the best songs on this album aren't even close to the quality of those on their last album. It almost sounds like you are listening to songs that didn't make the cut for their first album, ""B side"" songs. Even their radio hit ""Bent"" pails in comparison to ""3 AM"" off their first. The entire album lacks energy and catchy tunes which their first album was so noted for. In fact, this album gets down right boring after a few listens. Rob Thomas is an excellent singer, but could not make up for this albums below-average song writing."
3,Too pop for me,"If this album was Matchbox20's growth, I think I will avoid any future albums. I mean, no insult or anything, but this album is not my cup of tea. I noticed a lot of synth, brass and strings. I'm sorry, but I like albums to be a little more raw than that. I would be more gracious if they actually had a synth player. Rest Stop is great. Mad Season is fun. You Wont Be Mine is great, altough not much guitar. This is the kind of thing that is in now, but I don't like it. Oh, and the people that said that their first album was just a Counting Crows copy-off, it's not. You don't know what you're talking about."
2,Former matchbox 20 fan,"After a tremendous first effort ""yourself or someone like you"", Mad Season was quite a disappoinment! I would have thought, given the amount of time between releases, the band would have put together a decent effort. With the exception of a couple of songs such as ""Bent"" and ""Rest Stop"", the CD is musically weak and has little substance."
4,Praise the Lard!!!!,"This cd is totally amazing. In a dream ""The Lard"" told me to buy this. I went out and bought the damned thing and now my friends: Jack Burton, Big Bill and myself can't stop dancing in the woods to it. When i was buring an effigy on Miss Ang's lawn with Big Bill we even listened to it. STR is so damned skilled, Melissa Beck style. Still I never have poked his nose though. Just trust me with this one, buy it and dance like a fool."
2,Compares to Superstar? Give me a break.,"Uh, no. I've heard that comparison a few times, and every time I do, it sounds crazier and crazier. This...unusual album, which, I'll admit, has decent rock and roll music and some clever refrences (the reason for my two star gift) does not even fall into the same category as the masterpiece: Andrew Lloyd Webber's/Tim Rice's JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR. The music is better in JCS, the religious messages are more accurate (the lyrics are much better), and the performance is a heck of a lot more wonderful. So for everyone who says that this album is ""everything Superstar wanted to be"", I gotta say, that isn't right. It really doesn't compare.Honestly, I didn't agree when certain people thought Jesus Christ Superstar was a mocking of the Holy Bible, but I can certaintly understand the arguement that this album isis. ""Judas saves""????? I could hardly write that.Stick with Superstar."
2,Not what quality I'm used to from Acorn!!,"I have an ancient pair of Acorn slip-ons that I just cannot throw out because they are my absolute favorite casual shoes. They are in great condition, for around the house and yard-just looking rather frayed on the fabric and beat up on the leather. I needed a new pair that I could wear in public. Thought I'd try these as they most resemble my favorites, but they are really flimsy and will no way last as long as my old pair. Why, oh, why do you keep obsoleting really great models??? I'll keep watching for ones like this with nubuck and thicker soles. I'm not bothering to buy, until I see the clogs that you made before, I don't want to be disappointed by a favorite shoemaker!"
5,I LOOOOOOVE THEM!!!!,these are a must buy!!! i love the quality and I look so good in them if I do say so myself. I bought the large ones because I just needed a few dollars to fill up my cart and they were only 6 bucks. I usually wear a medium but these work fine. I would buy 100 of them if I could!
3,Makes thin waffles....,"Bought this, makes thin waffles... not like big fluffly Belgium waffles or anything. Not quite what I wanted out of a waffle, too dense for me. So, I never use this. But, if you know the kind of waffles it is going to make, and enjoy them, then by all means buy it."
5,Easy and Informative!,"Over the last few months I have been searching for a book to help me in my quest to build my own birdhouse. I have a large yard with lots of trees and a few ""store"" bought birdhouses but I was not satisfied. When I got the book, ""Birdhouses: 20 Unique . . ."", I imediately noticed how easy it was to follow the designs and the ideas. The hints on how to build were easy to follow and had good detail. From material to tools to locations, it was full of facts and even gave me many ideas on how to expand on my own creations. All in all, this was the best book I found on the beginning woodworker's desire to build birdhouses. I would recomend it to any hobbiest."
1,don't waste your money,"the plastic pieces of this hoop straightened out after a short period of time (in a few short weeks), making it impossible to put back together in the circular shape they came it. A COMPLETE waste of money. The plastic was not meant to curve and only stayed curved temporarily."
4,Good quick read,"A very nice book, probably not as good as his nine Bernard Samson novels, but still a nice read. It has the usual globetrotting spy aspects and is done in a way that only Len Deighton could pull off. If you are a fan of deightons this is sure to please."
5,Another Perry mystery,"As with all her great stories, Perry once again delivers a gem. Exactly as advertised, I was more than delighted."
4,Disagree! Best version of Piggybank,"This has my favorite version of Piggybank, hands down. Its a bit slower but builds to a good climax. You can't go wrong with the Thrill Kill Kult remix either. Very good stuff. And for only $5 dollars? Come on."
1,What use is it??,"I bought the "" GAME BOY ADVANCE SP PRO GAMERS KIT"" because I thought it would FIT ALL my games and my game boy advanced.IT DOES NOT FIT MUCH OF ANYTHING .It""s to small and not designed well.The items that came with it are made CHEAP and not very useful.My mistakeP.S. I thru it away!!!"
4,A GREAT PORTABLE CASE,This is A Great carrying case and package it comes with all u need and your gba sp is still in good condition and your games are protected with game cases this a GAMERS dream case and it has a fashionable look it is platinum color with makes look like a brief case so nobody needs to know whats inside!!!
1,Noted Scientist,"Agreeing with other reviewers, I feel this may just be the worst movie ever made. At least Plan 9 had actual dialog spoken at the same time the movie was filmed. Tor Johnson'snly line is ""YAHHHH"", repeated several times when he finds his dead female victim has disappeared. Seems about right. I watched this as part of the 50 movie classics horror films, so I paid about 50c for it. About right"
1,The yucky beast of Yucca Flats,"A fat old Russian scientist (Tor Johnson) defector with moon pictures gets irradiated Yucca Flats. He becomes a scaly that with a penchant for girl necks. We spend the next 54 minutes watching people running around saying kill them all and let God sort them out.Most of the film is narrated if that's what you can call it. A side benefit is that we get a chance to see what 1961 cars, cloths, haircuts, and sleazy women (Lanell Cado ... Woman Strangled in Opening Scene) look like.The opening scene was tacked on at a later date. If you are lucking you can get a copy of a topless Lanell Cado. And just who is the stand in for Tor Johnson in that scene?Them! (Snap Case) ~ James Whitmore"
3,Painful...slow......badly editing......,"I've never seen this movie by itself,so I can't give a good review,except for when I seen it when MST3K did this back in early 90's..What they did was funny(as always)and made the movie more enjoyable.Coleman Francis is THE worst director there was and should have chosen a different occupation....Too much narration(just ramblings really),bad editing,no acting;and so on....By the way,who killed the woman at the beginning of the film anyway????..Tor??...Alot of it doesn't make sense??? The movie is too short as well.....Do yourself a favor and get the MST3K version instead and don't waste your time on just the movie itself!!"
4,"""Touch A Button, Things Happen""- Like This Awesomely Bad Film","Even if you love ""so bad it's good"" films, this one will still leave your jaw resting heavily on top of your fuzzy slippers. Maybe it's the worst movie ever made (or sold), and maybe it's the most amazing and inventive assemblage of cost cutting film making techniques ever. I don't know enough about film making to be sure, but it's still a mind bogglingly bad film. I don't have the time or patience to chronicle even half of what's wrong here, that could fill a 200-page book, but if you enjoy making fun of bad movies, this one's good for several viewings. I've watched it at least 6 times and it still inspires plenty of cheap shots. It's wrong for every second of it's 59 minutes- no redeeming qualities. Find it for a dollar or 2 and watch it, if you dare. You may not like it, but you will be amazed at how bad bad can be."
4,positive story on human relations,"Plainsong is such a gentle story. The book is great for lying in a hammock or in a comfortable chair with a glass of ice water by your side and reading very slowly. His characters just draw you into their town and lives. My favorite characters (very hard to pick) are the McPheron brothers. The images that come to mind are the brothers from that very surprising movie, ""Secondhand Lions."" This book an overall has a positive attitude on life despite some of the speed bumps that arise. I really enjoyed the fact that the Haruf allows us to enjoy the story without having to tie everything up into a neat and tidy package at the end. Life isn't like and neither is this story."
1,Painfulsong...,"I read this book before I checked any reviews on this site. Wow, what a dissapointment. A friend told me, ""You will love it, just like Faulkner!"" I guess I won't try anything by Faulkner now. Nothing is resolved, the characters are lifeless, the lack of quotation marks a constant annoyance. I kept looking ahead to see how many pages I had left. When I missed a point, I did not go back to reread a passage because I just didn't care. Why did so many people like this book? A case of the ""Emperor's New Clothes"", yet again."
3,"Pretty good, could use more depth","Plainsong is almost entirely about its characters, and both their personal challenges and their interactions with their fellow rural neighbors. The writing is as sparse as the action, as it moves along leisurely, with occasional very poignant and moving moments.The strongest arc is that of the pregnant girl and the bachelor brothers. That whole thread seems highly unlikely, and I was tempted to roll my eyes at the premise. Even so, the author pulled it off, thanks to the strength of the brothers and the persistence of the girl.Maggie is not one of the highlighted characters, but in many ways she is the most important, bringing the girl and the brothers together and coming closer to Guthrie. I wanted to know more about her.The threads with the boys, Guthrie, and the mother simply didn't get enough of my interest. Above average, just not compelling.3.5 stars"
4,"A slow moving, small town story","At first I was distracted by the writing style. It gave me a feeling of distance from the characters. After a while I didn't notice that so much because I was wrapped into the story line. This is a really enjoyable book dealing with community and family. The humanity of the characters is genuine and real. None of them are perfect but they are all believable studies of human nature. I would recommend this book to others, although some might find it lacking in action. It is a slow moving, small town story that I found interesting and gentle."
5,truly a good read,"I really enjoyed Haruf's novel, ""Plainsong."" The characters were intriguing and like-able. The individual stories of the characters were woven together to create a larger story in a way that was simple yet beautiful. Containing reoccurring themes of innocence lost and redemption, the novel maintained the raw element of reality throughout. The portrayal of small-town life seemed pretty accurate. The novel ended on a positive note without being overly cheesy, which is refreshing. I highly recommend this book."
5,"Absolutely top shelf, difficult to put down","An avid reader for nearly 60 years, I enjoy a well written book and have cut a wide swath through the works of many authors. Rather than repeat what the story is about or attempt to compete with some well written descriptions in Plainsong, all I can say is that I consider it top shelf, an absolutely wonderful book that I have recommended to quite a few people. It deserves a 5-star rating."
3,Plainread,"In many ways, this book reminded me of ""Cold Mountain"". ""Cold Mountain"" was somehow a richer reading experience than ""Plainsong"". (The only problem with ""Cold Mountain"" was that it's end was too rapid). ""Plainsong's"" characters were interesting, yet not solidly developed. The ending left me with the feeling of. . .""okay, so what was the point?"" This book was, by far, not the best that I have ever read, but it did manage to hold my interest to the very end. I just wish I could have found the same inspiration that others have reported:)"
1,overrated,"I would like to think it is because I am only 22 and this novel was written by a man 40+ my age and that I cannot relate to him, but I have read Faulkner and Hemingway and McCarthy and can't rationalize anymore. This book was horrible. In Haruf's attempt to emulate great novelists, he fails with intermediate and weightless prose, reminding me of many 'authors' in my middle school. The characters had no feeling. They were as vague as the setting and I had no impression of the novel except that it was a waste of time. The dialogue was highly implausible and the situations the characters fall into are so desperately lacking feeling that I don't feel for them. If this book was a finalist for the National Book Award, then literature is going downhill. It's violently upsetting."
3,a pretty unrealistic 'realistic'novel,"The town doesn't know whether to believe Tom (a career teacher with no history of trouble) or Russ beckman (the town bully with a laundry list of priors)?Victoria, who has been presented as sensitive and caring, doesn't ever think to call theold men from Denver?Come on.But for all its 'All the Pretty Horses'-wannabeness, Haruf has written a genlt, engaging novel. Only, its more of a supermarket-Oprah bok than real literature. To me, anyway."
1,Why did I read this?,"Because it was a very fast read (skim), simplistic & superficial, and on our book discussion group list. It must be of regional interest, it hardly seemed like any real people were involved - agree with earlier critic, in that, the characters never said anything in quotes. It was as if I were looking in on play characters running around the scenery; and the convergence of characters was a stretch of early childhood imagination."
4,Enjoyed It - Would Recommend It!,I really enjoyed the book and liked the author's style of writing. I found the characters believable and likeable and wished I could know them for real and that life was really like the way it was in the book.
5,WONDERFUL!,"This is one of the very best books I've read in a while, and I read 2-3 books a week. I had to force myself to read it slowly so I could savor it. The writing is simple and beautiful, the setting and climate are evoked descriptively, the main characters are honorable, courageous, and likable, and the McPheron brothers are fabulous. I knew it would be excellent when I saw on the back cover that Richard Russo and Howard Frank Mosher, two of my very favorite authors, praised it."
4,True to life,"A book I have to say, I could not put down. Starts off a little slow but as the story unfolds grabs you. You feel like you are living in Holt, Colorado and surrounded by the people in the book. I fell in love with the McPherons, Victoria and Guthrie. I absolutely loved this book, I can't wait to read what happens next."
3,Appropriate Title,"The author has definately given this book the right title. Plainsong. This book was about a few people who had some sort of connection to each other but not in a direct way. The characters were not quite as interesting as they were destitute in some fashion. For instance, Victoria has no family or support, Guthrie has no romantic love, Ike and Bobby have no parental supervision, the McPherons have no life outside of farming. It goes from there. At times I wondered where the story was going... at others I wondered when it would end. I found the most interesting parts involving Victoria and the McPherons. Their relationship was heart warming; the men were very loving in their own way. The one thing I definately liked was the narration. There wasn't the standard quotation marks around the characters dialoge. This made me think it was a story told by some one who was told by someone else and is just repeating it. An interesting view of narration."
4,rural colorado,"I enjoyed this book - maybe because I lived for twenty years in the plains of Colorado. Small town life, including the Legion Bar, the ""bad"" families, the school environment, were so real. There was humor with the socially misfit brothers. (Are we to believe that's what the young sons will become?) If you like realism, dry humor, and interesting characters with emotional appeal (I would have liked to get more background on the mentally ill mother.), try this novel."
3,Lots of plain.,"There are some beautiful moments of dialogue to be found in this novel, unfortunately they serve only to make you wish the author had crafted more original characters and a more orignal story. We've all met the pregnant teenager, the gruff men with hearts of gold, and the self-sacrificing femal teacher in countless novels and movies. That their stories merge here is no surprise, though one is surprised that the author doesn't even bother with creating a plot point to justify the convergence."
1,One of the worst books I have read,"This book was horrible. The characters were not developed, there was absolutely no plot, and no point. I didn't care abouth the characters because they were so underdeveloped. I felt this book was a ramling book with no tie up at the end. The McPheron boys sounded stupid instead of like humble farm people. Pointless parts: Mrs. Stearns, Guthrie's fling with the school secretary, and Bobby and Ike going to the McPherons house after they find out about Mrs. Stearsn.Horrible book. I can't see how anyone liked it? I like how a previous review said a case of the ""Emperors New Clothes"". That is exactly how I felt."
2,Plainsong,The book is in OK condition. It has yellow pages making it look older than what it really is. I could have bought another book for $1 more and not yellow -- easier to read.Plainsong
1,PLEASE do not buy this book,"I had to quit reading this book shortly after I started. This is the worst book I have every had the misfortune of getting. It is the most depressing, worthless book I have ever come across. I will not make the mistake of reading anything by this author again."
4,Simple and Meaningful,"A lovely and simple book, looking at life in a small town. The characterizations and interactions of the main characters was very real, drawing you into their complicated lives easily. I loved the McPheron brothers and their simple but heart felt attempts to connect with the young Victoria Roubideaux. Tom Guthrie as a father stuggling to bring up his sons as a single parent was interesting, but I found his sons Bobby and Ike even more interesting. I like the way each persons life crossed into the others, all courtesy of the kind and seemingly all knowing Maggie Jones. My only complaint is that I wish the ending had more resolution to it. But life is like that, not everything is wrapped in a pretty package with a bow on it. All in all a very enjoyable book."
3,"Somehow, it sticks to your ribs","If you're looking for riveting reading, this book is not it. It is quiet and as unadorned as the Plains it describes. And it ends without climax as life usually does. Yet its humanity slowly seeps into your bones. The characters stick to your ribs and make you wish you could mail them a postcard wishing them godspeed."
4,Hang In For The Second part,"The book seems fragmented at first until you start to link the characters. The motherless boys, the pregnant teen, the school teacher, and the two old bachelors take turns being the focus for five or six pages, then it jumps to another one. The situations of each depressed me, but the descriptions of the small town, the people and their conversations gripped me and would not let me quit.I felt much better towards the end as good things happened, mainly through Maggie's efforts. Her character intercedes in several situations but I felt I really knew little about her.I guess I really wanted this book to be more like Ivan Doig's This House of Sky. Try that one if you haven't read it yet."
2,Boring and Tedious,"I hated the fact that there were no quotation marks and I found most of the characters to be incredibly boring. Also, we never really learn much about what makes the characters tick. When teenage Victoria's mother finds out Victoria is pregnant she kicks her out of the house. Why is she so bitter? Guthrie's wife first stays in bed all day at home and later abandons her two small boys. Why does she behave this way? We never really have any answers in this book. The ending was particularly disappointing and vague. We know that Russ does something (I won't spoil the story for those who haven't read it), but we never find out if he is prosecuted for it. We know that Victoria has her baby, but we never even find out what the baby's name is. For a more entertaining book on small town life with equally unlikely relationships (strangers taking in teenage mothers, etc.)I would recommend Where The Heart Is by Billie Letz."
2,"Quick read, believable, mildly gratifying","This book reads quickly. It would be good for reading on an airplane. The story is extremely believable but there were few surprises and little character depth. Several scenes do stick in my mind: the girl and the two guys, the kidnapping of the two boys, and the autopsy of the horse. However, these were insufficient to make this book a great read. I compare this book to Barbara Kingsolver's or T. Coraghessan Boyle's or Comac McCathy's and it falls short. Those writers are better (at least based upon this one book)."
4,100 Words or Less,"After 100 pages I'd no intent on continuing. I've grown tired of the ""poor rural barbarism"" that permeates many novels recently.Yet wait. This review is a rave.I came back to the novel with a little hope and was rewarded. Where the first half focuses on people's cruelty, the second half rebounds with simple humanity and a true insight to how people can better the world ... not on a grand scale but for a few neighboring souls.This almost non-read becomes a great novel. It's a testament to Haruf's skill and trust in us to keep the faith."
3,The Simple Life,"I enjoyed Kent Haruf's ""novel,"" but I tend to agree with some of the other readers here that I was more impressed with Haruf's spare imagery and spot-on dialog than the rather pedestrian plot. Haruf is a good storyteller, problem is, the story doesn't really go anywhere. The characters are well-drawn, however, and I found myself wanting to learn what happens (or doesn't happen) to them.I was confused by one section of the book involving the boys and an elderly neighbor on their paper route. I may have been making too much of an effort to tie everything together.I would recommend the book, but you may want to keep your expectations low. It was a pleasant book, plain and simple."
4,a bit blended,"here's a story of the country, a story where people birth cattle, use tree trimmers to perform an autospy on a horse, and live lives as plain yet parodoxically complex as the wind. it's a fine story, character driven; the plot does no spectacular turns; it's soft, gentle.the one problem i found is that the character guthrie could also be one of the mcpheron brothers. they're not quite as distinct as i like characters to be.it's a quick read, and worth the time; you'll feel like you've just taken a drive in a convertable through the western plains."
2,"This book skims the top, without going to the depths I need.","This book, while good for the basics and overviews of general material, lacks in the specifics that I really needed to get going. The examples on disk are not very good. I try running a number of the scripts and I get run-time errors. It would have been nice to see scripts that would help me get started right off the bat. Recently, I was forced to go out and buy another book to cover material not covered in Cross Platform PERL."
3,What a fun movie!,"Chinese mythology, campy modernism, a bit of ""stretching"", an interesting story line and some not-bad acting combine to make this a movie that the whole family can enjoy. A favorite in our family for many years, we were pleased to be able to add it to our CD collection."
2,"Primitive graphics, short","Despite the primitve graphics (by todays atandards)I was starting to have fun with this game. Just as I was beginning to think this game was OK, it ended. It's short. $10 is even a little steep for this game. I would say $5 would be fair. Better off getting something newer, unless you have a weak computer and video card."
5,"Laurie Watson, LMFT, LPC, sex therapist","I've been looking for a book for many years to recommend to male clients that teaches how to really touch a woman. Working with women struggling with low desire, I know that, too often, low libido results from her partner's poor technique and a lack of education about a woman's sexual response. Most men learn about sex either from pornography which is completely misleading or from experience which may or may not have taught him what he needs to know. Even sexually experienced men may not know what really turns a woman on. Castleman has produced the best comprehensive book that I know of, to educate and help a man become a superior lover."
4,Love Frog & Toad,"My 3 year old son loves this book. Unfortunately, he is focused on the ""bike story"" because of the front of the book...there is no bike story, sorry. Frog & Toad are great!"
1,"Pan arrived in good shape, but the labels are BS.","As a previous reviewer stated, the tape and labels they use will not come off the pan. I have tried (as a commenter suggested) olive oil, canola oil, soap&water, lacquer thinner - no joy! The darned label/tape glue is still on the pan!!! What a load!"
2,Size too small,"It's my own fault for not realizing how tiny this pan is, but it is so small. I made a boxed angel food cake mix and had to do two batches because I only had this one pan."
5,Great Pan,"This is a great pan, The non stick always burn this one is a traditional pan that cooks great."
3,Cake an Review,"I am a fan of the Wilton Cake Products, but, this Angel Food cake Pan deceived me. I was looking for the one piece pan and this does not show that it is a two piece pan. I suppose the secret information is in the name of the pan. I needed a 10"" x 4"" Tube pan for a large pound cake. I do not like the two part pans for this type cake. However, I kept the pans, due to the issue of return shipping and re-imbursement. Thanks for your products and availability--just know that I am not a fan of ordering anything from a picture--it is too easy to overlook important issues like one piece pan vs a two piece pan.RDM"
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"Ever since I watched a cooking show that featured Angel Food Cake and it recommended this type of pan (non-non stick surface and with the legs to hold it upside down), I was looking for this pan all over the place. I used it, and I am happy with the result. The only complaint is that the paper cover and labels were so sticky and left the glue residue on the surface. So it took a very long time (and muscle) to clean the pan before being able to use."
3,Fastidious,I like this book but it demands a lot of ingredients to prepare the blend. One has to dedicate a whole weekend to this to enjoy later on.
2,My least favorite Album,"I only like 2 tracks of this album, In my opinion is a little boring. If you like the speedy Sonata Arctica, this album is not for you. At least ""Days of Grays"" is a better album"
4,Not their best....,"I just finishing listening to the album and seeing as how not a single melody is stuck in my head, this is not their best material. This album is a natural progression from Reckoning Night. It's complex, well written and the production is flawless. However, there is not a single fast song on the album. People like me who love ""8th Commandment"" ""The Cage"" and ""Wildfire"" will be disappointed, this is not a power metal album. It is a beautiful piece of work, but will put power metal fans to sleep."
2,Eh.,"Following the trends, Sonata Arctica has bailed out on the hooks that made them popular, and opted for hookless parts of songs strung together in a pattern that I have yet to figure out. This is Power Metal's equivalent to a jazz exploration. I would have to say that I don't really recommend this album to people who like straightforward power metal, however if you like more progressive metal, you would be fairly at home with the random changes, odd time signatures, structureless feeling of the songs, and would likely enjoy it."
2,Too Small,"I was expecting it to be a lot bigger. Most of the words I'm looking for are not included. I found a cheaper, bigger one at Walmart."
2,Should have listened !,"Other reviews dead on , these are not what I expected, I took a chance because I needed green pants, the waist size was right , but the pants are tight in the thigh and butt area, I do not like the elastic above both side pockets , I probably will not wear again , salvation army for these !"
4,Very comfortable,Very comfortable for a big man. The expandable waist is a PLUS for comfort. I will order these in other colors in the future.
2,A little short,"I chose this rating because the inseam was not 36"". I measured after I noticed they looked a little shorter than usual. A little more attention to detail please. The inseam was 35 1/2"". When you are tall and have difficulty finding pants that 1/2' makes a big difference."
2,Stretch waist ... yuk,"The description of this pant mentions a ""modern waistband."" It should say a ""stretch"" or ""elastic"" waistband (that when extended shows the white lining of the pockets ... like cheaper pants from other retailers ... like the one that starts with ""J.C."").Unlike the Dockers I have always purchased, this is a design downgrade that I was not expecting based on the item description and my prior purchases. Had to return the pants.I will say that Amazon made the return process easy and free ... way to go Amazon! 5 stars on their commitment to customers."
3,"not good, not bad either","I bought this because I love stars and it's not as amazing as I hoped it would, there's special instructions and different temperatures you have to set your oven to than the standard temps for baking...kind of a pain! and it's hard to get whatever it is in the pan out of the pan...I greased the pan up to ying yang and it still didn't come out in one piece! it's still pretty cute though and good for special occasions!"
3,Decent... but a bit of a dissapointment,"Bad Religion is one of my favorite bands and one of the true all-time greats. But I'm sorry, this and No Substance are slightly dissapointing. I loved everything before, even The Gray Race which didn't seem to go over well. Anyway, this album is a little overproduced, and the fact that they are on Atlantic and don't have Brett leave kind of a sour taste in my mouth. The songs 'Believe It' 'You've got a chance' and the 'New America' are good, but don't hold a candle to he classics (No Control, Atomic Garden, F*ck Armageddon, 10 in 2010, etc.) But don't lose hope- the new album Process of Belief rocks, I'll tell ya that! Brett's back on, they are back on Epitaph, and the songs are an amzing mix of all of their stuff! Buy it, not this album!"
2,Bad Religion at their worst,"Now let me just say I'm not one of these people who hate Bad Religion, and I don't think they are sell outs or anything like that, but this album is really really bad! I listened to it like twice and just couldn't make myself listen to it again. Now if you are looking for a really good, new, Bad Religion CD get Process of Belief (the following album to this one), for me that was the return of the TRUE Bad Religion. This CD is a waste of your time and money."
1,very bad,"this is by far the worst bad religion cd ever, if your a big bad religion fan i know you wont be able to resist giving it a listen, but believe me it sucks and may damage your conception of what a great band this really is...i know it did me.try no control and the gray race"
2,Not a good follow-up to some classic albums,"I'm disappointed man, I really am. I am a HUGE Bad Religion fan... have been for years... This album marks the decline of a once fantastic band... If their next album is a return to the stuff they used to do, I will forget about this record. It's a departure from their usualy sound, and that's ok with me, but the messages are convoluted and become lost. They try to attack everything at once, instead of just making a few good arguments. Your money is better spent on older BR albums."
2,Bad Religion's worst release,"I'm a huge Bad Religion fan and love their newer stuff but this is just subpar. I don't have a problem with the slower style of writing...the songs are just plain bad. There's no catchy choruses or anything. Greg's lyrics arn't even that good. I'd only recommend this to die hard BR fans and even they should buy it used.In it's defense there are three decent songs. You've Got A Chance, It's A Long Way To The Promised Land, and Whisper In Time. The rest is filler."
5,It's good...,"This is my first Bad Religion cd and I like it a lot. So I've heard that it's softer than their past stuff, I have nothing to compare it to because I've never heard any of their other stuff (except that nifty little song on the short music... comp.) but I like it and isn't that all that matters? I am a fan of both old school and new school punk and I like this album so I advise you to get it."
3,"Too small for 17.4"" laptops","The case is very nice. however, it is too small to accomodate a Dell Studio 17.4"" laptop along with the power supply and mouse."
4,Awesome Hat,One of the birthday gifts for my grandson...he loved it...wears it almost all of the time...excellent value for the money.
4,Another one slips thru the cracks,"This is another example of a great CD not getting its due (as in no airplay or promotion). That's the general music public's loss. If you are reading this review and like music influenced by the Byrds, Wilco, and a little bit of Big Star, then by all means hunt this CD down and get it. After just one listen, many of the songs got stuck in my head for days. It still gets many rotations in my player and gets lots of attention every time it is played."
4,All in all; an amazing collection but plan on buying alittle more,"Have had the set for 9 months now. I believe that I have watched 80% so far. Very little bonus materials on each disk. The bonus documentary disk was alittle disappointing, only 20 minutes or so. I thought is was going to be a preview for the entire set or something other than what it was. After reading reviews before purchasing, I did buy clear memorex cases for the set immediately to protect disks, original packaging is strange. Basically every disk slides in/out of heavyweight paper pages.If you really want a complete Clint collection, plan on purchasing some of the 3packs here on Amazon as well. It will really tie things together because there are alot of holes throughout the decades.Movies and disks physically are very clean pictures and sound great. Alot of hidden gems that you ordinarly wouldnt watch otherwise if were not included. I even enjoyed Space Cowboys!"
2,I wish that I have known about the problems with the discs before buying,"I bought this set because I am a big fan of clint eastwood but while watching the movies I am running into discs that will not play, even after cleaning them. :( it is a very VERY bad idea of the way they have packed the discs in this set. please do not buy this set until they come out with a different way of storing the discs."
5,Clint Eastwood: 35 Films 35 Years,"I purchased this as a gift for my husband and he LOVES it. What a great collection. Organized and compact, they utilized both sides of the DVD's!"
5,"LEARN SPANISH THE FAST, EASY AND ENJOYABLE WAY.",Why didn't someone think of this approach sooner. The book is brilliant. It's also a good read. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn conversational Spanish without the pain of having to struggle through verbs and other excess baggage. L. Adams has hit the nail on the head and provided a whole new way to experience success in learning the language and about Spanish culture. Bravo.
5,Best Towels I've Owned.,"It seems a bit much to review a towel, but I'm so pleased with these that I felt it necessary. I bought 3 so I could use them at the Gym. After my first use, the towel was virtually dry. I rolled it up put inback in my gym bag and tok it home. When I removed the towel I couldn't believe how dry it felt. It was almost as if I hadn't used it. I hung it overnight just to be safe, then rolled it up and back into my gym bag for another day. At this rate, this towel could last all week. I plan to stock my bathroom with these next."
5,incredibly soft towels,I ordered these for our kitchen to use as hand towels. They are very soft and sturdy.
4,Mio P550,"Fine PDA with GPS.If you don't really need PDA function you should go for the ""normal"" embedded GPS units.They run much longer on battery, louder and the screen usually brighter."
4,A very good PDA with a really bad screen,"Nice, fast and load with a lot of extras. GPS: Up to 6 sat very fast, nice reception even inside the car. It have a really bad, poor quality, bad res screen. But the rest is good. If you don't mind the bad resolution screen is a nice option."
4,Very Good GPS for money,I think that this is very functional and well executed device. Once you get used to the software it is accurate and easy to use. Very good car mount which allows for many configurations inside your car.WiFi and Bluetooth both work well and fast.Windows Mobile is not any worse or better then other hand held PC. Messaging and sinchronization work OK and this could be reasonable travel companion rather then laptop. You do need to carry a charger since battery life is short. You get couple hours if you use your energy saving mode.
4,Good Enough For My Needs,"So basically, I have found this product to be more then what I needed intially, but that isn't a bad thing. I have to admit that the GPS program that comes with it "" MIO MAP"" was a horrible program, It wasn't easy to use, and I am a computer tech. There were just a lot of problems connecting with the GPS, that is untill I installed my own GPS software which is TomTom Navigator 6 for PDA & Smart Phones. I just had to play with the settings for the GPS to work with this program, but now I have to say it works like a charm. I really do recommend this little device. it is an awesome price for all that you get. Now if only they could come out with a GPS/PDA/Phone. That would blow the Iphone out of the water."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Very poor Battery life. But worst of all is the tech support there are no vista drivers for this. emailed tech support they me to change my OS to XP. then I called tech support and was told they aren't going to put a driver out, because the unit was built before vista came out. Also, it's very hard to use the gps in progams other than Miomap. The PDA/GPS is a great idea but this is the wrong one to buy."
2,Disappointed,I am a little disappointed with Leanne's recipes. I followed this book for 6 months and although they are ok recipes most contain garlic and not much else in the way of spices and flavor. So everything just tasted like garlic and I love garlic! I like the convience of the shopping lists and the side suggestions even if they are a little bit repetitive. I also like the seasonal part of the book. I just don't like the recipes they are a bit bland. I started using Rachael Rays books and watching her show. When I become more adept at cooking and adding ingredients maybe I will come back to this book and add the spices that they need.
4,Saving Dinner,I Received my book Saving Dinner and it came in very good condition. I looked over it briefly until I get more time but I bought it so I could save time on making dinners It looks like a very good book
4,Saving Dinner,This book is very helpful and the Garlic Lime Chicken recipe is a weekly item on our dinner menu - My 2 year old loves it! It helps with meal planning and saves us money because we don't have to eat out.
5,I can't stop giving this book away,"I keep buying copies of this book to give to other people. I like it because it has simple, tasty recipies that appeal to a lot of people, ie kids & husbands. LeAnne uses different seasonings (I have tried some new ones for me) that always turn out delicious, and not too much. I don't use the shopping lists, I just use the book for the recipies. I like the fact that the recipies are basically very nutritious and the recommended side dishes are easy to do and very healthy. Some of my favorites are Mexican Torta, Carmelized Garlic Chicken and Skillet Pizza. I took the Mexican Torta to work for a potluck and everyone wanted the recipie. I am an experienced cook and fairly well organized and love having new healthy recipies to try!"
4,A great kitchen resource,"Our family found this book to be extremely useful in getting our weekly mealplan organized. The positives of this book for us were:1. The meals are delicious!2. Most of the meals are easy to create.3. There was a lot of variety and we got out of the recipe rut.The negatives for our family were:1. We don't like eating this much meat.2. Our food bill went up. We never ate dinner out before either, so we didn't notice a cost-saving there.3. The recipes call for a lot of fresh produce in the winter, which doesn't always make sense. I rarely use fresh tomoatoes except when they are in season."
2,mostly disappointing canned ingredient entrees,"Where are all the 5 stars coming from and what have those folks been eating!!!! I bought this to have help planning GOOD, HEALTHY meals, but this is so centered on canned ingredients and ground beef, etc --without really any vegetables or vegetable dishes to speak of (the average ""menu"" suggests you just ""add a salad""), that I'm not sure it's healthier than average fast food. And the recipes so far haven't even tasted very good. Why not just buy frozen dinners if one is that desperate to sit around a table at home. At least you'd get green beans in there."
4,Caught by surprise,"This order (24 clear Claret, 750 ml Bottles) came so fast that I was surprised when it arrived with another order. The seller didn't offer tracking information so I was expecting (based upon the expected arrival date listed by Amazon) this to take a while. I think it was a total of 2 days from the time I order until it arrived. All bottles were intact. I was surprised to find that they look more like hand-blown glass than a mass-produced item because they each have a slight bulge/ring of imperfection around the middle. I don't think it's something that will detract from the overall presentation of the mead that will be stored within them, though."
5,Love the Wiggles,"My 2-1/2 year old son absolutely LOVES the wiggles -- and the dolls are great! He has ALL of them! I highly recommend them to any parent that has a child who likes the wiggles, esp. for those who have sons -- it's a nice ""boy"" doll!"
5,Short but effective,"They're shiny and black and just the right length. They have a male end and a female end and they make everything fit just so nice. I'm in love with them. They've changed my life. Now all clutter is removed, and finally I can see the sun coming through.Warren"
3,Slow start appearing negative but then changes to positive,"This is a book appropriate for preschool age children. The start of the book starts out negative about how elderly people need help, need glasses and other devices. It depicts that elderly people our not able to function very well. Then the book takes a change and focuses on friendships. It finally gets across that it doesn't matter what age you are because if you are a friend that is all that matters. Overall and O.K. book but could use a little more positive view of the elderly."
2,blondie hasn't made a good record since 1981,"The single ""Good Boys"" is great, sounds like classic Blondie. The rest suffers from mediocre material and uninspired production. From 1976 to 1981 Blondie recorded 5 great records, ""Blondie"", ""Plastic Letters"", ""Parallel Lines"", ""Eat to the Beat"",and ""Autoamerican"". All great, especially Parallel Lines and Eat to the Beat. Avoid anything after 1982, ""The Hunter"", ""No Exit"" and this one."
2,Garbage,"I thought, with 'No Exit' Blondie really kicked off their second career part. Forgotten were the terrible 'The Hunter' and 'Autoamerican' albums... but 'The Curse of Blondie' is just terrible. It's neither fish nor flesh... it doesn't rock, but it is not a good pop album either. I am not sure, what the band tried to do. If you don't believe me, listen to 'Desire Brings Me Back' and tell me, what this song should be. Terrible ! Too bad, here I thought Blondie had a couple of additional 'Eat to the Beat' or 'Parallel lines' CDs in them... but I was wrong."
4,"A Quick eval. of ""The Curse of Blondie""","--------------------STRONGLY RECOMMENDED-------------------------This new comeback album is definitely a must-to-buy for all die-hard, been-there old Blondie fans AND all the young rockers, for educational purposes :DThere is not a single weak song on it in spite of unprecedented variety in genres (from rap thru pop to hard rock).Blondie just got better with age (like Queen, if you are old enough to remember.)My favourite tracks are:1. End to End (a classic rock piece)2. Hello Joe (an easier one, with nice keyboard tunes)3. The Tingler (eighty-ish pop tune)4. Songs of Love (a haunting ballad with great saxy)BUT the rest are also excellent in their own league.One thing is sure: ""End to End"" shall turn into a rock legend soon, like ""Call Me"" and ""One Way or Another"" and many more did before....----------------------STRONGLY RECOMMENDED-----------------------"
5,Get Cursed,When I first put this cd in I wasn't blown away. I was in love but I wasn't convinced that the rest of the world would love it. Then I listened again and I was awe struck. This is not the type of cd you can just listen to once. It's like a drug. You listen once and the songs stay in your head. This album is incredible and flawless. Blondie has always faced harsh critcism undeservingly. This time they didn't care and they don't have to. This album explores areas of music that stay with you. It isn't trendy or commercial but solid and time less. If you're looking for an ablum that you can't wear out this is it.
1,What a disappointment!,"Wow! Big Blondie fan, thought No Exit was great, but this CD is horrible! Don't know the history, but as an import, if this was an attempt at Europop, Eurotrash, Eurowhatever, it's a flop! Vapid lyrics, boring riffs, and most of the tracks sound like copies of older hits. A must-avoid."
4,Great Book!,"If you haven't bought this book yet, I suggest you buy it. It is the longest book yet (over 300 pages), but in this case, bigger is better. In this tenth sequel to one of the most popular book series out there, the Baudelaire kids reunite with old friends, and are seperated from Sunny by Count Olaf. Violet, Klaus, and their two friends have to find Sunny in the wilderness. Meanwhile, COunt Olaf and his troupe forces Sunny to commit to chores an average baby cannot do. And you might be quite surprise at what Sunny SAYS.As usual, Snicket keeps you guessing at the end of every chapter. And even more suspensful, the note to the editor is even harder to read than past books, which you may or may not like. The book is a little slow-moving, but is well worth your money. Go out and buy this book that keeps you guessing from page 1 right now!"
4,Lemony Snicket strikes again!,"This is definitely one of the best in the Series of Unfortunate events. It was kind of confusing but still, there was a great cliffhanger at the end and lots of adventures (which includes climbing up a slippery waterfall, digging a great pit, trying to rescue Sunny from Count Olaf, and spying on Count Olaf and his comrades). Lemony Snicket has definitely done it again with a wacky, unexpected, and twisted ending. But then there's always the saying,"" Expect the Unexpected."""
5,Wow!!! Spectacular!!! Fantastic!!! Super!!! Great!!!,If you are in need of a good read The Slippery Slope is a must. This book is off the hook !!! It was well-written. It is filled with adventure and exciting events. These three little orphans are trying to escape from this ugly beast like man with a unibrow and a frightening tattoo. He is after the orphan's fortune. He has got the youngest orphan locked up with him and his crime spreeing troupe. Her older siblings are trying to free her. Will this ever happen?¿ Will Count Olaf ever be caught?¿ Will the fortune be recieved?¿ Read the book to find out. When you pick this book up you will never sit it down.(^_^)
5,"Dear Lemony Snicket Fans,","Put this review down now! No, you can read it I am just demonstrating the amazing and unique way that Lemony Snicket ... draws his reader by telling them NOT to read his books. This book is maybe the best one yet, in The Carnivorous Carnival, they gave many questions, but never answered them. ..."
4,Slippery Slope,"The 10th book in the Lemony Snicket series is a wonderful continuation of the Baudelaires' tragic story. It continues to portray the mysteries and struggles the Baudelaire childrengo through. They are still trying to escape from the sinister Count Olaf, but this time around they must rescue their babysister. Violet and Klaus have to utilize their skills conjunctively, to get Sunny out of Count Olaf's evil grasp. These troublesome situations show the Baudelaire siblings would do anything for one another. This book is full of adventure and excitement!"
4,Good book...,"...though it doesn't advance the story very much. I'm almost done, however, so hopefully the final book will be satisfying."
5,Best in the series.,"Well, I've only just started Grimm Grotto, but Slippery Slope stood out to me as the most interesting stories in the series, introducing important plot development that would go beyond just this book, as well as character development, especially for Sunny."
4,GOOD BOOK,First of all this book was sad and mysterious. I feel bad for the Baudelaires but the book was very good.
5,Series of unfortunate events #10,I love it! Very exiting unfortunatly ive read the whole series and its very exiting i dont agree with the people who dont like these works of art! Even though the end left us wondering what was going to happen next and that is was a bit sad i throughly enjoyed the series
5,The Slippery Slope,Oh my gosh I LOVE THIS BOOK!! I am so hooked on Lemony Snicket books I read it in one day! I think this was one of the best books by Snicket. I have the whole series and I never get tired of reading them over and over.PLEASE MAKE MORE THAN 13 BOOKS I LOVE THIS SERIES!!!!~*Emily*~
4,FINALLY!,"I am a great fan of Lemony Snicket - and his Unfortunate Series. As a result, I expect a lot of his books. His books all are excellent but it reveals only a little at a time. This book includes a very nasty person who returns from book 5, two characters that are so evil that their names are not revealed, and a very tiring Pledge. Also there is a SURVIVOR of the fire. I was so surprised.Anyway, a lot of VFDs appear in the book. The next book's title is not revealed in the author's letter. And many unexpected things happen; well, just read the book!It deserves five stars, but well, Violet's inventing skills and Klaus's researching skills were used over and over again. I expect a change; although there was one in Sunny. A MUST read."
2,Beautiful Music -- Not Chanting,"If you've experienced 'live' chanting, without musical background, this CD will not bring that experience 'back'. I was hoping for male voices, chanting in unison. This CD contains 2 entries, both of the same song. The first version has singing with it, the other is the instrumental only."
3,Pleasant but repetitive,"The melody is lovely, the singing voices are nice, the instruments are nice. But this CD is very very repetitive, so if you don't like the melody you're going to be disappointed. Also, this is singing, not traditional chanting, so don't be surprised. It is very pleasant to fall asleep to. The liner notes are interesting, although obviously translated by a limited English speaker."
2,The flip side,"...the flip side of the movie business, that is, this memoir of a former agent and producer. The 300 films he mentioned are scattered throughout in italics. Mr. Medavoy writes extensively of the process of producing movies. He makes sures we know he is responsible for the success of many motion pictures. He also admits no one knows why one film which shows every indication of becoming a smash will fail, while another will come out of nowhere and become a hit. OK, but there is no gossip. There are no entertaining anecdotes. There is nothing interesting, in fact nothing to interest the average reader who is interested in Hollywood. I said the average reader. These pages and pages of numbers and formulas and musings about box-office openings are no doubt fascinating to accountants and marketing people. I picture them swooning over this book. If books could be compared on a scale with movies, one might say ""You're Only As Good.."" is the ""Citizen Kane"" of number crunchers."
1,Lacking,I didn't like this book. It was bloated and uninsightful. The writing was not particularly good either. This will end up in the $1 book bin.
4,studio boss reminisces,"Published in 2002, much of this book deals with motion picture studio deals, players and practices dating back to the 1980s (when the author ran Orion)."
2,"Good idea, but still unbelievable","As a Filipino American, I read this book with a critical eye. I was impressed initially of Garland's grasp of Filipino language and his descriptions of Manila life. The narrative was not the greatest, at times slow, mundane, and lacking in texture. Part II of the book was, I think, most unbelievable. The book left me wondering whether Western writers actually see places like Manila the way it is written in The Tesseract. If so, then it gives reason not to read this book."
1,This book was a disappointment,"I liked the movie ""The Beach,"" but reading ""The Tesseract"" made me not want to finish the book (""The Beach""). I agree with a lot of the reviewers who did not like ""The Tesseract"". I thought this book was unfocused, discursive and not very compelling.The only reason why I persisted with this book was because I am Filipino-American and you don't get very much about us in art nowadays. His description of the climate and Tagalog social intercourse are insightful. But author's atheism and the nauseating violence annoy the most patient reader. Persistence does not pay for this one."
1,"A winning formula, wrong book","The Beach was a good book. Why? Because it combined travelling with adventure in a way that many guide books do not. I snapped up a copy of The Tesseract hoping to travel through the Philippines without actually going there and be persuaded that I should. I read this book three months ago and cannot remember anything about it, other than it was set in the Philippines. If you want a suspense thriller with travel, buy Le Carre. If you want travel pure and simple, buy that guide book. If you want to waste your money, try Las Vegas. Don't buy this. Mr Garland should takle several leaves from Mr Grisham: develop the winning formula first, then repeat it. And then repeat it. My advice for a third novel: Call it ""The Boat"" set it in Indonesia, have a lead character that keeps Leonardo Dicapprio in work and give the twenty-something something to think about."
3,3.5 Stars!,"The Tesseract is very Pulp Fiction like in style. It intertwines three short stories into one very nicely. Although the first thirty or so pages of the novel are very slow and boring don't give up. It's gets way better with time and you'll be glad you kept reading. The story is very engrossing and cleverly written. However, if you are expecting The Beach, this is not the same genre of book. Happy reading!"
3,Mower Mulch Kit,"This kit works great but the flimsy connectors that secure the kit hardware to the deck break off easily and the hardware can get caught up in blades so I suggest buying better connecting screws and bolts to secure the hardware. One piece of the hardware fell off and I did not even know it. I never found it, but the mulching still happens just not as good. If anyone has the hardware and isn't using it let me know."
5,What a piece of work!,"I consider this production to be perfect. I first heard it, and taped it, in the original Radio 3 broadcast. Then I bought it when it came out as CDs. I lent the third of the CDs to a pupil who didn't manage to return it. So I've bought the set again just to replace that CD, and I think it was 30 well spent. What surprises me is how few copies there seem to be left in the world."
1,Shakespeare's worst,"I am hardly a fan of any Shakespeare: I find that his characters overact, talk too much about nothing, and spend most of their plays inserting extra words in to sentences that could be said in four words or less.Hamlet, however, reaches a new level of Shakespearean lackluster: This one is simply boring, with lifelessly dull characters that can never seem to figure out what they want. It follows the standard Shakespearean tragedy plotline (Guy has stuff happen to him that's either really good or really bad, two little subplots, and then everybody dies), but this one lacks spark, or even a pulse for that matter.Well, there's my two cents... Go ahead, find my review unhelpful if you want... but seriously, if it's Shakespeare you want, go buy a different play than this."
3,heresy .. but strangely thankful for it,This book promotes one of the greatest works of the Western canon - yet at the same time profanes it. So how should I vote?
2,Not quite as expected,"This book was not in as good of condition as I had expected. When I received it, I was surprised to see highlighting on every page and illegible handwritten notes in nearly every empty space."
5,"""To be o not to be""","Shakesphere's Hamlet, is a CLASSIC book. I love the charcters line and the Introduction. It's about a prince(hamlet), and his uncle Claudius, and him marrying Hamlet's mother Gertude. It's a great book. You see him fighting against himself, self against society, self against nature. If you are a great fan of Shakesphere, it's a great book to be in your shelf! This is not like Romeo and Juliet, it's totaly different!"
2,Different cover and book,"The book that I needed for class had more reading then just the play. It looks like the book in the picture. However, I got sent Hamlet that is just the play and a different book cover."
3,satisfied but not thrilled,"The description of the book said that it was used, but in near-new condition with no markings. It was a bit worn and there was writing and highlighting throughout most of the play. Then again for four dollars what can one expect? I needed a book and thats what i got."
5,Great! But somewhat different from their later stuff.,"The full title is actually ""A Girl Doesn't Get Killed by a Make-Believe Lover....'Cuz It's Hot.""Some people don't like this, say it's too repetitive, blah, blah, blah. But the thing is, this (at least the title song)is dance music. I believe it was originally released on vinyl for DJs (much like the stuff on their Kooler than Jesus cd).Music meant to be played in a club is structured differently than music meant for radio. It tends to be longer (8-9 minutes) and has something of an emphasis on the beat.Anyway, 'Cuz it's hot is one of their best songs. Rather than being industrial or having jazz-ish sound to it, like their later stuff, this is rather house like. Very 'groovy' and disco-ish. But it still combines their trademarks, 'b-movie evilness', silliness, and sex.Most TKK fans already have A Daisy Chain 4 Satan (as it's on their best ablum), but it doesn't hurt to have another copy of that."
1,This is not the real one,"This is not the real one, it smelled terrible! It is not the original I even thought it is men colon when I first smelled it I thought I made a wrong order!!!"
4,A Lovely Tale to be Told,"This is my second Zebra regency romance. The other was utterly boring and not owrth mentioning while this one was a sweet story I enjoyed immensely! Anna was an enjoyable, friendly character I wish I had in a friend while Valentine is a generous and loving man. It was refreshing to read a book where the gentleman falls for the lady first and not for her looks (although Anna was a beautiful girl). The only reason why it did not get a full 5 stars is because you really do not know if Valerie and Anna renew their friendship. I would have liked the reassurance of it. But don't let that keep you from reading this one.RATING: 4.7 starsOther books to read: The Silent Suitor - Elisabeth Fairchild (5 STARS); The Painted Lady - Barbara Metzger (4.7 STARS), Anna and the Duke - Kathryn Smith (4.5 STARS); Catherine and the Pirate - Karen Hawkins (4.6 STARS)"
2,THAT LOOKS LIKE A TOOL SHED....,"The main attraction of this film is super hot high school kid Taylor (Jenna Scott). Her and some of her immature pimply faced friends are headed out to a concert when they run out of gas near a creepy abandoned farm house. The driver, Drew (Ryan Hulshof) goes up to the house to attempt to get some assistance. When he doesn't return, the kids come after him. This was your basic slasher formula. The kids in fact joke about it as they look around. The dialouge was immature, and I thought realistic to the point of being bad. The slasher character was not developed at all. Who is he? How is he related to the kids? We find out about midway through the film when we are read an old newspaper clipping, something every good slasher keeps.The blood, killings, horror, and suspense just didn't make it.F-bomb, brief sex, no nudity, Jenna in a bra/ bare midriff in a sweetly tanned body. Better than your typical Tempe production, but doesn't measure up to an Asylum."
1,Don't Even Watch For Free,"I saw this movie for free on Fearnet on Comcast Cable. This is not a ""horror"" movie, it is a ""horrible"" movie. It looks like it was made by a film school dropout (first day). Nothing happens for the first 35 minutes except some terrible acting. When they finally get to the killings they are cheesy with no special effects except some red substance squirted around. The bad guy half heartedly tries to catch the last two girls who keep getting away from him. He appears and stands there while they get away usually after beating the crap out of him. Somtimes he sticks his hand through a door or window and then disappears for a while, like he's saying ""Boo!"". The only reason to watch this movie is to say that you saw the worst movie ever made. And only watch it if it is free. If they sell one copy at the $24.00 Amazon is asking for it they will recoup their production costs."
5,A fine read,"This book has so many reviews of praise, so I can't say much that hasn't been said by everybody else here. Like Interview with the Vampire, this represents some of Ms. Rice's best work. The brilliant but enigmatic Lestat we all wondered about in Interview with the Vampire gets to tell his own story here, and what a fantastic story it is! Bravo to Ms. Rice for writing this book! 4.5/5 stars for one of the best books in the Vampire Chronicles."
1,Vampire Lestat was Mundane,"While at first engrossing, I found that the rising action, not to mention climax and resolution of this story to be severely lacking. Characterization was intriguing at first, but lost its luster the farther into the story I progressed. I read this at school during Health class, and it took me almost two months to finish it! Anne Rice needs to learn how to write shorter books for people like me."
2,Bless her heart,"My girlfriend wanted me to read this, and i wanted to like it. Let me give the uninitiated a brief glimpse of the book; it goes something like this:-Start: Exciting, swift, entertaining........starts to go on a bit.......long periods of yawning and feeling guilty for skim reading page after page.......gets better again :EndThere it is, no more no less. Not a great masterpiece of literature as some believe (If you'd ever read one you'd probably know). Average, long winded. I could try and tell you why, but the book has left me so exhausted that i am not going to waste any more effort on it."
4,Long but good read,I am reading through the series. This book is very descriptive and tells the history behind Lestat. It also brings up others that we hear about again later.
4,"Great story, disappointing hardcover","I used to have this book in hardcover back when the cover was yellow and had only the title on the front and my brother borrowed it and lost it. I was excited to see that I could order it in hardback once again but was a bit disappointed when I arrived. I was expecting a larger than paperback hard cover book, but what I got was a paperback size book with hardcovers. Anyway, I thought I would put this type of review for those out there who were looking to replace this book rather than it being a first time read. I am a huge Anne Rice fan, especially of the Witch and Vampire Chronicles and was hoping to replace a favorite book."
1,Spare yourself!,I LOVE to read everything and anything and I have this weird thing about finishing books no matter how bad they are. Well in this case I couldn't even finsish no matter how hard I tried (and at that point I just wanted to finish to get it over with).I read Interview with the Vampire and I struggled with it. I gave it the benefit of the doubt since I saw the movie first and figured that is probably why I didn't like it. So I decided to give Lestat a chance and I am sorry I ever did. I found this book to be very boring. It moved at a very slow pace and I gave up waiting for it to get good. I'm sure how so many people can love this book and consider it a great piece of literature?! I definitely will not be reading any more of Anne Rice's books.
4,Good Product,Received on time and was a perfect fit. Would buy again. Received instructions with it which made installation easy. Would buy again.
1,A work in progress? Not recommended,"I am using this book in my ""Intro. to SQL Database Programming"" college course. I'm sorry, but I cannot recommend this book - it was obviously rushed to print before the bugs had been worked out; figures are missing important details (e.g., the Schema in Fig 1.4); and the index is laughably deficient. Not enough examples are given. This book should not have been printed in its present form. Numerous typos exist. It needs a lot of work. NOT RECOMMENDED"
5,Wisdom Of the Mystic Masters,I recieved my book packed in great shape and in record time. I am very pleased and would buy from Bev again!! (~:
5,tha rewiew,This cd is another 2pac hit. Most of the songs deals with depression and the reality this artist went through at that point of his life. 2pac is the greatest rapper and has proved it in this album. The intro is awesome most of the song r good so its worth the buy. I recommend this 2 anyone whose life is hard or is hopelees as some songs deal with this and at the end encourage people to handle. This is worth the buy 4 any 2pac fan and Yes this Cd is better 2 buy first than tupac ressurection.
3,Havent heard it yet so i gave it a mediocre rating,I havent heard this album yet. I just want to respond to all the trash that these rocker guys were talking about 2pac. I don't only like rap. I can listen to anything. But you guys sound so arrogant and stupid. You havent heard all of 2pacs stuff. Have you read his poems? Probably not. You're gonna judge the guy's knowledge by his rap music? He went to college and stuff. I'm pretty sure he knew a lot more than you. Please dont be little arrogant prejudiced jerks about this stuff. Us rap listeners can easily claim that you rockers sound retarded because all you do is scream. BUT WE DONT. WE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TO KNOW SOMETHING TO TALK TRASH. Go on and maridnade on that. P.S. OUTKAST IS THE BEST YEEEUH!!!!!!
1,the Self-Fulfilling Prophecy Syndrome,"More exaltation for a dead guy who not only created his own problems, but blamed society for most of them. And now his mental problems are marketed to teens who essentially believe all his miserable bullcrud and end up ruining their lives themselves. Well brothas, you only live once...don't waste it in prison. Keep pishing and moaning about how hard your life is, and you just might be another victim of 2PAC and his sad mental disorder.There are other things in the world besides being obsessed with the THUGGZZ book of conduct."
5,amazing,I think this is some of Pac's best work because it is deep and tells how he really feels about all of his emotions. You can't go wrong with a 2Pac album but this one really stands out.
1,Who is kidding who!,"Listing this title in the karate section is misleading as it has nothing to do with karate, but rather low level gymnastics with a karate flavor. The performer clearly has no knowledge of karate and is simply performing or dancing, in a rather grotesque manner, what she believes karate movements look like.This program has no instructional value whatsoever, exhibits only a passing similarity to modern ""Sport"" karate, and no connection at all with defence-based traditional karate.Should have been listed in the chop-suey aerobics section where it belongs"
4,Excellent Introduction,"The 16 lessons provide an excellent introduction to spoken Brazilian Portuguese. Each 30 minute lesson incorporates critical vocabulary, important grammatical rules as well as ample review material, all presented in a straightforward, lucid manner. The interactive dialog with native speakers conversing at a normal pace builds confidence in speaking and helps develop an ear for the language. This is the best feature of the course. The biggest drawback is the absence of a workbook. I understand the argument that looking at the words can detract from learning the speech, especially in a language like Portuguese with its unusual spellings. But not knowing how the words are spelled leaves a big gap. I highly recommend it as an ""introduction"", but you'll need to buy something else even just to get a basic overview. I guess that's why the publishers promote their full first level course by giving a discount to purchasers of this program."
5,Easy Breezy,Got this for my hubby for Christmas. He came home speaking newly learned phrases after listening to the first lesson during his commute from work. Very easy to follow format and Brazilian pronunciation clear.
3,Good Intro to Travel in Brazil.,More formal language than what Brazilians actually use. The second disc says to consult the workbook. There is no workbook.
5,Conversational Brazilian Portuguese,This is the next level in the Pimsleur course and it is excellent. In this course they start covering the basics (so one might skip the Basic Brazilian Portuguese course altogether) and they also explain how to use the casual and not only the formal way to address people (ie asking a friend or a child for directions vs. asking a stranger or another adult). I highly recommend this product...one short road trip and you are already able to use quite a few phrases. This course is entirely audio just like the basic course.
3,Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing!,"I bought this video and like it, but I always want to hear Diana and Jean Terrell sing the songs they originally recorded! I enjoyed it very much as a one time thing.I was on vacation and I mistakenly put these songs on my Ipod. When I listened, I began to crave Diana's voice. The songs are okay being song by them, but the originals sound better.I wanted Mary Wilson on Floy Joy or Jean Terrell on Bad Weather!"
3,Nice but not new,"While I found the singing on this CD to be superb, I was surprised to discover that not only are these highlights only but the entire recording exists, and it is not new. One has to wonder when a record company releases Highlights from an opera recorded in 1994 (!) and tries to put it over as a ""new"" recording. Could this be because at the time of the release, Renee Fleming was not yet the huge star she is now, and the company would like to make a little money? Why not promote the entire recording? Other than this question, I find the CD to be a worthy recording. Renee sounds terrific - no surprise there - but the other singers (such names as Bruce Ford and Nelly Miricioiu, which are new to me but doubtless not to more knowledgeable operaphiles) are equally strong and the result is an interesting recording of a rare work. For my money, though, I'd rather have the entire recording - which is still available."
3,"Dark, with something mysterious moving through the story.","There were bits and pieces in the story that I liked. I enjoyed the character of Miss Dempsey, the housekeeper. She seemed the most human to me - even with her little eccentricities. But I was very disappointed with how the story went with Sister Philomena. Everything in the village - including the convent - was purposely dark, but I was hoping for growth of some sort with at least some of the characters. But the only one who seemed to grow at all was Miss Dempsey. Other characters might have moved on, but they did not necessarily grow in the process."
2,An odd little novel,An odd little novel by the winner of this year's Booker prize. It was one of those books I'd always known about -- who knows why? -- and was determined to read one day. The story centers on a Roman Catholic parish in a provincial English town in the 1950s. Fludd is the name the young curate whose arrival upsets their little world.
3,Scrapbooks,"Good condition, wish I had checked out the date on it, too old and out dated. Good for beginners I suppose."
1,"Fiction, pure fiction","I live in the same town as Joan Perry and know her personally and was (past tense) a client. The advice she gives in this book is taken from seminars put on by Tony Robbins and his like. There is not an original idea in this other than the literary device of telling it like a series of stories about individual women. Worse yet Ms. Perry does not follow her own counsel. She overspends, depends on men for investment decisions, and still believes in the ""white knight"" herself. In fact she does not really play a significant role in managing money at Take Charge Financial at all, she hires that function out to a professional money manager, a man! Nothing inherently wrong with that except her premise is that women should learn to make their own decisions. In short this whole book is a fraud! Reads nice but if you think about it she is talking down to us women who really put our money where our mouth is."
3,"Pretty good, but could of been better","The book had a pretty good story to it. I loved the part where she was looking at the newspapers and discovering her mothers past. At one point I was thinking, 'wow, this book is really, really good'. Right after that, though, it wasn't. The whole chapter was her thinking about how awful her mother was. Very annoying! The ending was okay, but not the best. And it was obvious an older person wrote this book. A pretty okay book overall."
3,NOT FOR TEACHERS,Teachers have to constantly put up student work on bulletin boards. I did not know that this stapler doesn't open so you can staple on bulletin boards. So for a teacher it is only 50% useful. They need to tell you in the product description that it doesn't open. Or maybe there is some secret lever that I don't know about???
3,Corrections of Artists,"The songs are correct (as of 1/26/09), but the artists are wrong. Each of the four artists sings 3 songs, in order. Thus, 1-3 are Kenny Rogers', then 4-6 are Randy Travis', 7-9 are Crystal Gayle's, and 10-12 are sung by Travis Tritt.My cover looks different, but has the same ISBN. It is a white cover with a faded blue picture of a guitar and snowflakes. The price on one sticer on my cd is written as three ninety-nine, although there is also a small sticker on it that says three dollars that appears to be original to the cd. Either way, however, I don't think that the list price is as high now as amazon shows, seven ninety-eight. (Perhaps mine is a slightly newer version reflecting a price decrease).I have not yet listened to this cd, but will try to update this review once I have. Thank you."
1,yuck,I got this in a package deal with 50 Shades but didn;t realize it was S&M. Disturbing tale of 2 girls who come to love being slaves. I hope no young impressionable ladies read this!
4,Second pair and counting...,"I bought my first pair and loved them, now on second pair and still love them. Sturdy, forgiving but still rugged. Break in is fairly quick and I only have a little discomfort initially with the upper ankle area. This is due to the stiff rubber/plastic that wraps the ankle. I do not mind the break in period as this same piece offers good ankle support also. Only drawback is the price, ouch. I have never paid $200.00 which is the price at the time of this review as they are usually around 129.00 to 169.00.Overall a good boot and I also prefer them to the Acadia."
5,The sweetest fur real newborn kittens.,"These kittens are very sweet & cute. They fill like real kittens.They pur,meow. They even move their heads. The coolest thing is that they open and close their eyes. Don't worry they don't bite, scratch, and you don't need to worry about bad behavior. They don't even need to use the bathroom. Now tell me that not cool or what!"
3,Operating system not compatible,"We could never get this game running. We've got windows 7 professional x64 and tried installing it both on Windows 7 and in virtual xp mode. Total waste of time and money. Could not return product for refund.Update: We got a computer with XP and tried installing from the disk, and again it wouldn't install. However, I copied all the files off the disk onto the computer and was able to install it that way. It did take a long time for anything to happen once I clicked on Curious_George_Installer.exe (5 or 10 minutes) but we did get it going!The game is cute, my 4 year old loves Curious George and has played the game all the way through twice in a row. He did need a little help with some of the mini-games, which was fun for me too."
2,Does not work like it claims.,I was dissapointed with the product. It did not help the under eye puffiness nor did it help with the fine lines. I am sticking with Oil of Olay.
3,Product isn't worth the money........,"I have used this eye product now for a month and haven't noticed any significant results. The gel is nice and dries smooth, but I wouldn't waste my money on purchasing it again."
2,Didn't do much,I have been using this product now for three weeks and haven't noticed any change at all. Disappointed in this product.
2,Merely Typical,This product while costing 3 times as much works the same way as Oil of Olay eye gel. Save your money.
4,Liked it,"I bought this for my grand daughter, she loved it! These dancers work very hard (and so do their parents!)"
5,Irish Dance Rox!!!,I love this movie I saw it on Tv but one of my friends told me that they did not show all of the dancers that were in the movie so I cannot wait to see the full thing!!Horse Crazy
3,Reel Long,My 8 yr-old irish dancer struggled with the length of this movie in the theater release. Great dancing talent but overall more 'reality TV' than big-screen. Two-three great stories of very young dancers captured - the other dancers followed aren't as captivating. Very accurate view of the ID world at this level although the attempt to add drama in the final-scoring scenes is too drawn out.
5,Jig,"As mom of an Irish Dancer, this was a wonderful movie!! It lit a fire under my daughter and she is practicing more after watching this movie. It was fun seeing others do the same drills as she does. I really liked the commentary discussing the differences between the U.K. and the U.S."
2,Poor Quality,"These are SMALL!!!! The feathers get ink on your palms and back, but what do you expect for 15 bucks."
2,hard to wear,"The quality of the feathers are good. The wings look great. But what's up with the super long arm straps? Instead of sitting on my shoulder blades like they do on the model on the packaging, they sag on my back because they are way too long.If I am wearing it incorrectly, which I highly doubt because I've wore other wings before and it seems like a simple enough concept, at least there should be a pamphlet with directions. A product like this should be easy to wear. I don't get why the manufacturer constructed the arm straps this way."
2,Why the high price?,"These cables preformed as well as a set of [$] cables on my new 30"" Wide Screen HDTV, even at 1080i. I am not sure what the increase in price was for, maybe the gold plated connectors or thicker insulation.I can't really recommend these over a cheaper set unless you have a problem with corrosion in your home (the only reason to have gold plating is to reduce corrosion, it does not provide enough difference in conductivity to matter) or you are going to be running your cables next to a source of a lot of interference, like a computer with a glass window on the side.Save your money for something else that matters, or do like I did, take it back get a refund, and a new DVD player for the same price!"
1,"Avoid the May 29, 2008 paper back edition","Avoid the May 29, 2008 Paperback, buy the Mass Market Paperback. A poor edition of a classic book, most of the notes were removed, and some explanations aren't there either, the book has been mutilated."
5,To all Christians,"I first read this book in the early 1960s when I had just become a believer the year before. There are things in this book that will help anyone to become a NORMAL Christian. It is not entitled How to be a Super Christian. It tells it like it is, turning to our spirit where the Spirit of the living God dwells will enable Him to permeate your fallen self and conquer the devil's influence in your life to become an Overcomer. I bought 15 to give to young people who love the Lord but are struggling to ""be a good Christian"". I gave them to someone to give to them anonymously. The Lord directed me. I don't want thanks."
4,great book,Book was in good quality and a wonderful read. I am reading it for a small group at my church. Shipping took too long is why it has a 4 star instead of 5.
1,What no zero or negative numbered stars for reviews?,"Don't waste your time or money. Instead, just read your twelve-year-old's first attempt at poetry writing; you'll enjoy it more than this tripe."
4,Dollhouse furniture enjoyed by grandchildren,Easy to work with; seemed durable; attractive and enjoyed by all. Woould recommend this product to others. Delivered as promised.
4,Moody anti-war pic,"Based on a famed book from the 1930s, this anti-war montage film follows the exploits of several WWI doughboys as they experience life and loss on the battlefields of Europe. It's a small pic with a strong theme. Those with literary leanings will enjoy it. I liked the very moody score. Check this out."
3,Shaolin Kung Fu Master,"There is a beautiful statue. The face es so expressive , but the color coat is not uniforme: in some parts of the body it see the color base. ( Sorry my english)"
2,Painful.....,I watched this as a kid and it does not hold up at all. It was really painful. the only good thing was Adam West and Burt Ward. Everything else - ughhhhh
1,JUNK!!!,I hooked the filter up and leaked from the get go. DO NOT waste your time with this piece of JUNK!!!
4,tells it like it is,"This book is credible because the author has researched the facts and has the disease. No laundry list of simple steps but rather a realistic discussion of the many frustrations associated with diabetes, the proactive actions recommended make sense without making it sound easy to achieve. Since this is the reality of diabetes management, the book's tone engages the reader who is has realized this will take commitment but wants to know there is a plan that works."
5,great!,This book was recommended to me by another diabetic who found it extremely useful. As a newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic I found this book to be almost like a 'diabetes for dummies' and it covered a lot of subject matter without getting too technical or diffucult to understand. I especially liked the history of diabetes section.A great choice for any diabetic!
5,Great book.,"This great book shares the experience and knowledge the author, Gary Scheiner, has. The author is diabetic too and he knows the questions, doubts, and afflictions that we have. He explains clearly without losing the technical approach. Gary explains in detail diabetes.This book really gave me a good aid to manage my diabetes."
3,It is what it is,"It doesn't get all my eye make-up off, but it still does a nice job. It leaves my skin a little dry, but this could just be me. I did expect a little more from the Neutrogena name and will be going back to St. Ives."
5,A great inexpensive product,"This facial cleanser is perfect! (Just so you know, I have combination skin and I'm acne prone.) It easily takes off my make up and whatever else happened to be trapped on my face! I feel so clean after I use it."
4,Not Bad,This read is pretty easy. The best time to read this would be after reading Plato's Republic. The similarites are astounding. You really will be able to see the concepts that helped to shape the nations of the world and their governments. These are the basic theories that helped to shape the philosophers that followed such as Rousseau and Hobbes. If you are interested in government theory this is definitely a must read.
2,Poor browning compared to higher-quality pan,Adequate pan with lackluster browning. I prefer my All-Clad.
1,"Nonstick Coating Wears Off, Company Blames Customer, Voids Warranty","I was really happy with this cooking set for a good number of years. So happy, in fact, that the 12"" Fry Pan became my favorite cooking pan. As a result the non-stick wore off under the normal course of its lifetime.I was able to get an RMA for the pan, but it was returned to me with a letter stating that the browning on the pan indicates that it was subjected to overheat and as a result, the pan will not be replaced.Problem is, there is no browning on the pan, and I've never overheated that pan. It runs at one temp and one temp only on my range and never empty.Do NOT buy this set if you expect, as I did, that the company will stand behind their product. In fact, I'd stay away from Emerilware, T-Fal, All-Clad and Cephalon as the letter sent to me indicates that they are all the same, extremely non-customer focused, company."
2,Eh!,We bought this for my 8 year old son's backyard birthday party. I wanted to have a selection of games for the kids to play. Getting the 10 in one was a mistake. Especially the net for the volley ball or badminton. It is flimsy plastic and doesn't stand very tall. Too short for adults to have a game of volley ball. The rest of the stuff was fine enough I guess. We didn't end up using the kit for his party after all. Don't recommend.
2,Missing all the shuttlecocks and the Support system,"The set I received was missing the two molded shuttlecocks, the Unique Shuttlecock with EVA tip and the Support system (Double Guide Rope system, Tension Clips and Ground Steaks)."
3,The kids liked it,I can't say I think it's worth $30 but it does what you'd expect. The badminton posts can bend if not carefully tensioned. We use it for our camping trips.
3,Problems in using with the Graco Snug Ride,"The snap in the name snap and go seems to refer more to the marketing concept than the actual functioning of the the device. The Graco Snug Ride does not snap into place, nor rest securely in the Snap N Go stroller if you follow the instructions. We experienced similar frustrations and challenges as other reviewers to get the car seat into place. Finally we used the advice of one reviewer and improvised on the instructions--we placed the BT bar in position III and removed the snap bar altogether. This seems to actually snap in, hold more securely and work better than the positions in the instructions."
3,QUESTION,Question for those of you that have purchased the Snap-N-Go Stroller...do the Britax infant carriers fit into this stoller correctly and securely?Ps...had to rate it so I could ask this question.
2,DOES NOT WORK WITH GRACO SAFESEAT,"Those that are complaining about your Graco's not fitting well, make sure you have a Snugride car seat and NOT a Safeseat. They look the same. The snugride fits the snap-n-go, the Safeseat does not. The boxes, web descriptions, etc. do not state this so we purchased a double one for our twins online, not knowing. I tried and tried to get it to work and it was just a tiny hair off. I thought I was doing something wrong, so I looked on Baby Trend's website, where I found a note telling you that the Graco Safeseat does not work with any of their snap-n-gos. You will need to spend more and get the Graco brand snap-n-go. I thought it was such a great idea for traveling, so my big monster double stroller wouldn't get torn up by the airlines, I wouldn't have to deal with the weight of the larger stroller, and the snap-n-go fits into rental cars better than my jumbo double stroller. I almost cried when I learned our Safeseats wouldn't work with it!"
2,Not ideal for Graco Snug Ride car seats,"the Graco Snug Ride car seat does not securely ""snap"" into the snap and go as indicated in the product manual. even after strapping in the car seat, i found the stability of the car seat on the stroller to be less than desired and less secure than i'm comfortable with. if you have a Graco car seat, i recommend spending the extra $10 to get the Graco version of the snap and go where the car seat will snap and lock onto the stroller much more securely."
5,AWESOME - THE BEST AND EASIEST STROLLER EVER,"I own 4 strollers and I pine for the days when I could use the Snap 'N Go Infant car seat carrier. It was so easy and convenient. It folded easily and quickly. Also, it folder very flat and easily fit into our trunk. It had all the features you needed including a nice roomy basket. I recommend this stroller to anyone who will listen!!! You will not be disappointed."
5,Lovely Little Christmas Cookbook,"I purchased this book for my sister-in-law, and she loves it. When I gave it to her, she immediately identified several recipes that she wanted to try. I gave it to her for Thanksgiving so that she would have plenty of time to bake for Christmas. It's a very quaint little book, with a lot of recipes. All of the pictures are quaint illustrations. Each recipe has detailed instructions. I can't wait to see what my sister-in-law comes up with--she's a real baker, so I know she will enjoy the traditional recipes in this sweet little cookbook."
3,the real popeye,"i took a chance on this dvd and i dont regret it!ali baba and sinbad are approx. 15 minutes each and are worth the price of the disc.i remember seeing these two classics in black and white on tv when i was a kid,and i had a cheap video tape of ali baba,but the dvd version is much better quality.the sound track is clear enough to hear all of popeyes hilarious mutterings.the other two cartoons are okay,but the 1956 animation just does not compare to the 1930""s ali baba and sinbad,.........the word ""classic"" really applies here."
1,"Nice to Rent, but Not to Buy","I found this DVD for rent and I am glad that I did. The transfer appears to have either been horribly botched or done from a low quality original. This is sad.Does anyone have a print of ""Ali Baba"" where the soundtrack in the final big fight scene is in sync ? I have not seen one yet.One star 'cause someone took the effort to put these classics on DVD, but 0 stars for the lack-of-quality of the effort."
4,"It's My Party, I'll Rock If I Want To","There are 3 classic songs on this album: ""Planet Claire,"" ""Rock Lobster,"" and the Limburger Song--er, ""Dance This Mess Around."" That's 3 more than most albums from people who are still learning to play their instruments. It sounds less revolutionary now than it did up in Athens in 1979, but it's still a lot of fun. The girl singers are so good, I wish Fred would just stick to dancing instead of ""singing."" The B's would go on more sophisticated musical projects, but nothing they ever did was this fresh."
2,Too Weird,"I don't get the appeal. I'm not even sure how to categorize this. Surfing music on crack? Whatever it is, it's too weird for l'il 'ol me, and that's all I really gotta say about that."
2,For a bag of beans?,"SO I get this e-mail, right? from Amazon saying this soup mix is 50% off. Okay I love a bargain as much as anybody so I click on the bag of beans that are supposedly 50% off and it takes me here, are you still with me? Good!The original box o'bags O'beans is $36.43 and the big whopp-di-do sale price is now $35.79. And that dear people is not 50% off. That is only sixty four cents off of the original... $0.64 for the love of all that is Kosher!? DO I look that stupid?That is not even the whole schmegecky! Now postage on that grand box O'bags O'beans is $18.45. SO I am thinking that Mandy Patinkin is going to deliver this box of goodies, right? Yeah right!No thanks!Even though I was angry at the time it is still a wonderful product, it needs a few extras added to it ot make it a real meal but, the flavor is great...Still ya gotta admit that $18.45 shipping for beans is steep for anyone..."
5,"Jesus ""If you love me, obey me"".","This is the book for anyone who truly wants to have eyes that see and ears that ear. Very even handed dealing with opposing approaches towards the law & gospel. You won't believe how much the law can figure into your life and how pleasing (not accepted), your soul can be before God."
4,Really nice for the price!,"I purchased this necklace as a gift for my girlfriend for Christmas. I was skeptical as I've never ordered jewelry on-line, but I must say that I was very pleasantly surprized. It was well worth the money and even cheaper and of higher quality than anything I saw at the mall or other chain jewelers. The pearls were a little on the small size but again for the price you just couldn't beat it."
4,good book,"This is a good book although common sense tells you most of the points already. Nevertheless, it is a good read and encourages parents on their way to raise kids without overindulgence."
3,"Well-done, no more","This interpretation of The Planets for one piano and four hands is good, but no more. In fact, it is well executed, but it lacks a certain passion, a certain flame that burns in the orchestral version. I don't think that it is just a side effect of the transcription: I sincerely think that most pianists prefer the technique to the atmosphere in this transcription and that is just what the York Couple did on this recording. Though the interpretation isn't the best, the CD is listenable and enjoyable."
4,Wonderful! Just as I remembered it.,"This album was played EVERYDAY in my highschool cafeteria when it first came out. I also have the original l.p. I bought (in highschool!) 1962? uh! This is just as I remembered it...the greatest folk singing trio to ever record. Favorites- This Train (it moves!) Bamboo If I Had My Way What harmonies - truly great to listen to, brings back good memories."
1,Enough Already,"I don't konw when I've read a worse book. I was expecting something on the order of Jan Karon. Clearly that's what Mr. Kinkade and his writer were trying to emulate, but missed the target by a mile. So sweet it gave me cavities. Without a doubt the painter of light has crossed the line into ""over saturation."" I swear if I see another Kinkade painting, plate, birdhouse, afghan or god knows what else, I'm going to hurl. This book is really not worth the money."
1,Kincade will never be as good as Karon,"I frankly felt that the character Jessica was very contrived. I had to push myself to even begin to care what happened to her and to read this book through to the end. I certainly didn't think Cape Light was a Bible-thumping town and most of the other characters were really believable. Too bad Sam fell for that twit, Jessica."
1,Warning: Don't buy airbed from Intex- No return guarantee.,"I agree that the product is very good. But the service is very bad. I got a broken airbed when I opened the box. There was a hole on the top of the bed(the soft side)that I couldn't use pads to fix it. As you know, the top side is folded inside, so it's impossible to damage during shipment. I was suspecious they sent me a used one. I called the retailer, then the manufacturor, then the amazon. It's useless because they write on the instruction that they don't guarantee any products.My suggestion is not to buy the Intex's product. Airbed is very easily broken. Find a retail will take the return."
5,Awesome product! I love it!!!!,This is such an awesome product. It inflates in minutes and it feels like your floating on air. This is one of the best nights sleep I have ever had. I love this product!!! and I recommend it to anyone. One additional interesting fact is that it deflates in minutes too. I thought it was going to be a long process but that was not true. The electric pump works like a charm. This is truely a great product!
3,"Not what I was expecting, but still okay.","This book, I thought it was a story, but it's a poem. Kind of like a narrative poem, the format disappointed me, but still tells a nice story, you just have to pay attention to it."
4,evangeline,I was on a tour and had just heard the story of the Acadians so the story was very real to me. It seemed like a true story of the time and injustice done to the Acadians. I enjoyed the poem very much.
3,Essential Reading if Your Dad or Loved One Served.,"With my father recently passing away, I found myself wanting to know more about what he and the other gallant sailors faced while serving on a destroyer in WWII. While some may find the listing of each ship lost, as repetitious; I found it helpful and a fitting tribute for all the destroyers lost in WWII. In the introduction, the author indicates his desire to convey to later generations, the understanding of what our destroyermen faced - you sir, have succeeded! I found the listing of each ship essential and a fitting reminder for those who make the supreme sacrifice."
2,cute but with problems,"Our transaction did not include instructions and this watch is set to military time. What kid needs military time on a scooby doo watch??? We also haven't figured out how to unset the alarm. We can change the time on it but not turn off the alarm. Make sure you ask about instructions before you order and if it can be set to regular time. Overall, I wish I had bought a watch without issues. It's cute but I could've found another cute watch without issues."
2,UCK.,"Yucky. Boring, sappy and longwinded with a messy story and lame songs that last for an eternity. Feel like being bored to sleep?"
1,EVERYBODY SING......,"Oompa Loompa doopity dooI've got another review for youOompa Loompa doopadadeeIf you are wise, from this movie you'll fleeWhat do you get with Tim Burton remakes?CGI crap and bad music...NO THANKS!Johnny Depp stinks and the kids are all lameAll Tim Burton's movies look the sameI CAN'T STAND TO WA-A-ATCH THEM!Oompa Loompa doopity diceTim should stick to making Hot Topic merchandiseThis movie really reeks through and throughSmelling worse than Oompa Loompa DOO DOO!"
5,AMAZING MOVIE!,"Johnny Deep is one of the greatest actors of all time. And as this movie is more acurate than Willy Wonka, it also has a more sloid story and a more in depth and crazy Wonka. If your a fan of Johnny Deep than this is a must own for youm along with that its a 2 disc DVD set packed with tons of extras. Well worth the price!"
1,Save Your Money!,"My wife and I watch a good number of movies. It's very rare that we both dislike a movie. I think the last time we really did not like a film was The Avengers remake. Well, you can add this movie to that list. What a bomb. Without even comparing it to Willy Wonka, this movie was a complete disaster. Johnny Depp destroys Mr. Wonka, the children are incredibly bland, and the music is downright awful. This film was a major disappointment."
2,"Awful Movie, Beautiful DVD","Maybe I watched the original movie too much as a kid, but for me, it just didn't feel like this film had a heart. It's just flat out boring.I was surpised - coming from Tim Burton - to see so much computerized special effects. The technically precise, glossy makeover to the film loses some of it's original charm.Aside from all that, the film is beautifully transferred to DVD. There is no noticable film grain or compression artifacts. The surround sound is very nice as well."
2,Oookay,"I was really hoping for a good movie, because my kids loved the book so much, and the Gene Wilder version was a little weird.This movie is bad. It seems that they took old movie and updated it - it is creepy. I love Johnny Dep, but he doesn't seem to have his heart in this movie. The effects aren't even good. The plot is shallow. The oopa loompas are all played by one guy who has no depth. The songs they sing are awful - you can't really make out the lyrics. The whole point of this story is to promote positive behaviors of children - and the point got lost somewhere in Charlie's psychosis. So much could have been done with this film - what a waste."
2,The Blob,"Charlie and The Choclate Factory is a Blob.It looks very weird.I'm describing it as a simple word ""Stupid""Jhonny Depp(Finding Neverland) is like the best part exept he looks like a girl.I'm happy AnnSopie Robb(Because Of Winn - Dixie)is in it but she's quit not a actress.Thats all I'll say ""Blob"""
3,Liked it better then the first,"I hated the org. movie, and still not wild about the plot. But I am a big Depp and Tim Burtan fan, so that made it good for me. I was bored a bit with both of them tho I fear.I saw this one at the movies and 3 days later went with my 24 yr old daughter to see it again, as she was home for a vist and does not get much of a chance to see movies.We both enjoyed it. It is with no doubt a Burtan movie, so if you are not into him, you will not be into this one. It may not be as good as some of his others, but still has his 'stamp' on it. But then I love Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas, Corpse Bride, and Beetlejuice. However I did like it well enough to buy it for my collection. (mostly my Depp collection but I tend to like the movies of Tim Burton's that Depp is in..like the two of them as a team.)"
1,this movie is retarded,"this movie sucks it's hot topic retarded humor is the most annoying thing i've ever had to endure. tim burton sucks (batman was cool, so was mars attacks other than that he's retarded) he reminds me of red and black striped shirts, trenchcoats, and baggy bondage pants. if you're into being retarded you'll love this movie"
5,A great children's movie,"People who complain about this movie completely ignore the fact that this is a movie for kids and youth, and it is a wonderfully produced piece at that. I like Johnny Depp in this movie - and yes, he does play this weird and odd character - he is supposed to! I found him quite charming.Kids love this movie! And I like it, too."
1,eye candy full of empty calories,"It's extraordinary how Tim Burton can make movies that are totally void of humanity and energy and this is his most offensive attempt. It's equally stunning that a remake can eviscerate the brilliant script of the original, take away all humor, quirkiness and cleverness and repackage it with ridiculous changes. And then there's the awful performance of Johnny Depp who has no concept of this character. I believe the original choice for the remake was Nicholas Cage who would've gotten the nastiness of Willy Wonka. I loathed the children and acting all around. I loathed the lame songs. I loathed the money that was spent on this. Take a look at some of the making of extras of the original movie and you'll see it was a labor of love. Like all of Burton's latest movies, this was made for the money. It's eye candy, but it sure ain't sweet."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"I was so disappointed in this movie. I LOVE the movie WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. It is fantastic. I thought that this new movie would be great. I was so wrong. Where was the OOMPA LOOMPA songs? And the Oopma Loompas were not oompa loompas. They were just one ""short"" man. I think it was a great dis-service to release this movie. Johnny Depp was eerie. Not eccentric. Just plain strange and frightening. And what happened to the golden egg laying geese. What good are nuts? Really? The only performance I enjoyed was that of the young actor who played Charlie. I am extremely disappointed in Tim Burton. I expected more from him."
3,I saw this movie,I have to say that this movie get a 3 because the first movie disturbs 5 sorry this movie isn't the greatest its okay!
1,emilie,Trust me I love Johnny and all and will go see any movie he's ever made but I have to say that this one really stunk! See the original instead of this remake.
5,A new classic,"A fantastic journey with Charlie and Willy, which in a simple way with clear examples shows us baic lessons of life.A dream of colors, flavors, textures, sounds... in a word ""magnificent""A must for every kid and adult in this planet! specially if the kids get to see it together with their parents to ask questions and enjoy."
5,"THIS ISN""T A REMAKE OF THE GENE WILDER MOVIE! IT'S ACTUALLY A CLOSER ADAPTION OF THE ROALD DAHL BOOK!",Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a good movie and Johnny Depp is superb as Willy Wonka!I have been reading reviews by numbskulls saying that they should never had made this movie and that it was a disgrace to remake a classic 70's movie like Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory well FYI: This is not a remake of the Gene Wilder movie it is actually a much more closer adaptation of the book by Roald Dahl so anyone saying that this movie should never have been made and that it was wrong to make a different movie than the one that starred Gene Wilder well they really should pick up a book once in a while because than they would see that there was a book that came before the Gene Wilder movie and that this Johnny Depp version is closer to that book!
3,Really weird but a good movie,"Love the movie. ""You're really weird, arnchya"" is my favorite line that sums up the film. There's no great acting here (with a hugely weak Wonka play by Johnny Depp), no great characters but a great, continually moving visual feast that is just plain weird. There is a Russian movie (forget the name) that is the longest single shot movie - about two hours - where the set just continually moves from scene to scene. ""Charlie"" reminds me of that movie but is much more visual. I think that the film pales a bit compared to the earlier Wonka with Wilder where the movie developed some character depth instead of relying on weirdness."
3,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"I don't think this version beats the original. However, my 14 year old daughter loved it and thinks it is better. Generation gap...."
2,This just didn't do it for me,"Maybe I loved the original one too much, but this version of the story did not work for me. I especially was disappointed in the music and the Oompa Loompas. Stick with the first one. It was perfect!"
1,Wanted to love this film,"Wanted to, so badly. I've always defended Depp's work, but the focus of the plot of the movie is so sappy and self-absorbed that I can't sit through the entire movie. The children's performances shine through, but Depp adds nothing to the movie.I rented the 1971 movie a few weeks after we purchased the new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and I fell in love with the Mel Stuart/Gene Wilder movie all over again. The new movie will never be the classic that the 1971 has become."
3,"Good tires, but not wide enough","I bought these to replace the tires that came on my department store (WM) Mongoose 29er because I wanted something that was better for commuting and the OEMs kept picking up any thing remotely sharp. They OEMs were just a cheap tire, but I knew that when I bought the bike. While these do have much less rolling resistance and have held up well they are much too narrow. The OEM tires were 700cX50 and these are 700cX40. I didn't think it would be that big of a difference but I was wrong. They look kind of dorky and don't absorb much shock, but I have yet to have a single flat. I love this bike, but sadly they just don't seem to make a lot of hybrid or commuter tires for 29er, and when I do find one the price is insanely high."
2,not excited,"I have never done a review before due to the limited free time I have but feel it is necessary. I will try to walk a fine line as I try to focus on positive. I feel as though Shelly spent too much time focusing on nonessential aspects. There are a few gems in the book but I believe it is not worth the time of reading through the ""blank"" pages to find them. But if you do read it, make sure you read about the cord cutting procedure at the end it is a truly wonderful exercise.I was very shocked to find that of all the several pages of recommended reading she never mentioned Serg King, which I shall at this time. I highly recommend ""mastering your hidden self"" and after that, only for the brave at heart, ""urban shaman""Now, I don't claim to be an expert and if I am mistaken please feel free to contact me. But I have found a wealth of amazing info on Huna from those 2 books."
2,"Sharpness, of the lack thereof","I've had this filter since February 2010 and use it on a Nikon D90 with a Sigma 18-250 lens. I've found that it is impossible to get a sharp picture when the lens is at or approaching 250mm. I've taken ""identical"" shots with and without the polarizer to determine if the problem is the lens or the filter and the filter comes up short. At wide angle to short telephoto the filter seems to do alright, but at long telephoto it produces a fuzzy photo that I cannot get to be ""crisp"" either with automatic or manual focusing, even when shooting from a tripod and making sure the aperture is the same to ensure the lens isn't the culprit."
3,Honus and Me,"The novel, Honus and Me was an exciting book to read. I enjoyed this book because it was based on sports. (Baseball) this was cool cause I could make a lot of connections.There were a couple of scenes in Honus and Me that were truly enjoyable. Including when Stoshack batted for Honus while Honus cleaned up his hand after Ty Cobb's cleats spiked him. Another favorite scene was when Miss Young came out with her shotgun and broke the fight up between Stoshack and Birdie who was trying to take the t-206 Honus Wagner card.If I could change one thing in this book I would have let Stoshack keep at least one of the Honus cards. I think the author didn't let him because he was trying to show a lesson.A few things were learned from reading this book such as always doing the wright thing. Even if it can make you mad. One thing I gained from reading this book was that even if people are bowlegged they shouldn't be judged."
5,"I find this Book Funny,Surpising,action packed,and Romantic","When our group read the book, we really liked it. We are sixth grade students. We thought the book had good description and good parts. A kid named Joe found a card that was worth half a million dollars. The card took him back into time. The part we liked was when we learned about Honus Wagner. Honus was one of the greatest players on the Pittsburg Pirates. This was our favorite book this year. We liked it a lot. Good Bye. From your readers from Hatboro-Horsham."
4,Dry but worthy,"In spite of the wealth of information here, the author is a little wordy and often doesn't get right to the point. Nonetheless, this is most definitely a worthy read for anyone interested in the art of persuasion, and particularly for litigators."
2,Not well presented,"The book may contain a lot of useful techniques and information. However the materials are not presented in a easy to read manner, making it a pain to read."
2,"Cut from Now It Can Be Told, Total Devo, & Smooth Noodle Map","If you have Total Devo, Smooth Noodle Maps, and Now it Can be Told, you have this album and more. The sound quality is mediocre and the cuts from the live album are ragged. There is nothing new, and absolutely no liner notes."
2,CD's like this are why people download....,"One good track from ""Smooth Noodle Maps.""One good track from ""Total Devo.""Five songs from the live ""Now It Can Be Told,"" and not even the best ones.No liner notes or pictures.It might be a cheap disc, but just be aware of exactly what you're getting."
2,Short and not sweet,"Not only is it a ""live"" version that is unexpected from the title, but the whole cd is only about 34 minutes running length. Truly only for diehard fans."
3,"Sure, it ain't essential, but...","Since ""Total Devo"", ""Smooth Noodle Maps"", and ""Now It Can Be Told"" are all out of print, this is a nice disc for those of us who are having a tough time finding those releases. I've got ""TD"" and ""SNM"" and frankly, even if you can find 'em, the tracks here are the best ones you'll find on those two final and rather disappointing albums. Not to mention the live stuff, which is top-notch. This disc is a lot more readily available than ""NICBT"". I've seen it in gas stations and resale stores all over the place. So, while it's not essential, if you're a DEVO fan looking for some of this OOP material, you could do a lot worse than pay a few bucks for this collection."
3,Uplifting but caution is advised in some parts,"Although several sections of the book are spiritually uplifting some Ulama, who deeply respect the author, caution that, ""one should be weary of the sections on belief and disbelief in Towards Understanding Islam as they do not reflect the positions taken by the majority of reliable Muslim scholars throughout history.The authors of such works have taken ""extreme"" positions because they have a specific purpose. They are not writing for 21st century Muslim minorities in America, but for a mid-twentieth century Muslim society struggling against secular represession and corruption (1)."" This fatwa on the book was given by Sulma Badrudduja at Sunnipath.(1) Shaykh Abdal Hakim Murad, Tradition or Extradition"
2,What Massacre??,"I won't go into the details of this movie because the Editorial Review Product Discription sums this movie up in a nutshell. As a horror movie fan, when I saw Slaughterhouse and Massacre in the title, I just had to rent this film. Disappointing. You are lead to believe that a really good horror movie awaits you but not so. Another letdown."
1,Disappointed,"The poles arrived in good time, but were not in good conditon. The baskets where missing and the handles and tips very worn and abused. When I opened the package they came in, a handful of dirt came out first. They were obviously well used and no one had bothered to clean them before shipping. I asked for a refund and returned them immediately. I did get a full refund but will probably never buy from this supplier again."
5,Excellent.,"I bought this for my husband, who has an acoustic guitar. It's extremely handy to have, since all he had was a hard case. It's soft, and has extra storage, and is easy to carry."
5,excellent,this bag is thicker than I expected. This is really a high quality product with an acceptable price. I really recommend this bag for those want a lightweight bag that can protect one's guitar effectively.
3,Too much preaching...,"I enjoyed reading the backround to the Glass children, as well as the snappy dialouge between Zooey and his mother. However, it seems at times to drift off from two characters having a conversation to long winded comments on religion.Of Salinger's work I have read ""Catcher in the Rye"" and ""Nine Stories"", I'd recommend them both over this."
2,if you REALLY wanna hear about it; i'd skip it,"Die-hard Salinger fans would pick this book up. I, regrettably, find the book exceedingly repetitive. The scant facts and hear-says about The Man are so re-used and re-cycled in articles after articles in this book. Save for the excerpts from Joyce Maynard's and Peggy Salinger's memoirs--which I am now interested to read, especially Maynard's--this book is a heap of junk."
1,The View of a High School Senior,Franny and Zooey was the worst book I have ever read. It is full of pointless dialogue that takes the reader weeks to understand and leaves him completely unsatisfied.
4,Franny and Zooey,"Franny and Zooey was an excellent book. The character's cynicism and reality caught my attention right away. I enjoyed Zooey most of all. I believe this is one of Salinger's best novels. The writing was simple yet thought provoking. The problems of the family were interesting and made you think of a typical dysfunctional family. I loved the reality of the book. It hit you and then forced you to listen. The theories of Zooey were profound and very interesting. I believe that Salinger is a very talented writer, one of my favorites, and he shows it in this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who can enjoy a harsh sense of reality and cynicism, mostly those in college."
3,Salinger's great?,"I have read Catcher in the Rye many times during the course of many years. I had never read Franny and Zooey. I haven't made up my mind whether I like this book. At the moment, I fail to see the genius I saw in ""Catcher."""
1,"""1"" star, because 1/5 of the book was good","the first 1/5th of the book was good, had a good plot going, interesting characters, vintage salinger, the cynicism, the whole nine yards. but then it just went to hell in a handbasket, fizzled and puzzled and wuzzled and ultimately just became unreadable and DULL. god bless you if you can finish this book and have enjoyed the whole thing...i couldn't. indigestable."
2,"I like Salinger, but this isn't one of his best...","This is a book about a brother and a sister. They both have problems in life, and it's just a story about a few days in their lives. It was kind of weird, and didn't really seem to have a point, and just about everyone in the book smoked, and it makes you want to start smoking or something...idk...it was just odd. I wouldn't really recommend this book to many people, because it was pretty dull."
2,look for another product,"I put these knobs in my home because I liked the shape and the finish seemed the best. I have had them for 4 years now and regret getting them. The oil rubbed bronze color easily wears off with normal use leaving the knobs looking really terrible. Although I liked the coloring and design initially, I would not use these knobs again."
2,Disappointing,"pretty sure this is just someone's vacation footage. no narration and just a piano playing in the background. it was only a 1.99, but i'm a little surprised at the quality."
4,Alaska DVD - Worth paying for..,I am absolutely recommending Alaska DVD to you guys. It is worth paying for. The footage really captivates my heart. It is so exciting to see the calving glaciers and the beautiful nature featured on it.
4,Great early Dead,"This, their second album does a much, much better job of capturing the essence of the dead than their first album and is even mixed with live segments, although it is sometimes difficult to discern them. It is not however the best representation of this work. Two from the Vault is the way to go for most of these songs. So I would not recommend to someone who is not familiar with the dead or who is looking to buy their first grateful dead cd. For those familiar with the band's work who have never heard this CD, give it a listen. Keep in mind that this song list, which isn't too shabby was the meat of Dead shows for several years (during the late sixties)."
5,Can YOU pas the Acid Test?,"Anthem is a total must. Wonderful album, very creatively put together (live cuts and trippy transitions between songs). I once read that it went way over budget.. the Waren Brothers execs probably wondered what they had gotten themselves into!I discovered this album pretty quickly when I was first getting into the Dead and loved it right away. One of the most coherent studio albums the band ever put together - a true work of art. There are definitely better versions of the songs out there, but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.I can only imagine how fun and exciting the mid-1960s in the Bay Area could have been! Get into a psychedelic mood, press play and let Jerry, Bobby, Phil, Billy and Pigpen open the door...."
5,great,"Great songs,Early Dead is unbeatable & this cd has A few classics, A must have cd for any real head! There is also 3 bonus live songs as well, I especially enjoy the live Alligator! Awesome stuff!!.."
4,Psychedelic Experimentation,"The Dead's second album captures them at the height of their psychedelic experimentation. The opening of ""The Other One: Cryptical Envelopment"" contains some gorgeous melodies and lyrics, one of my all time favorite musical moments. But after that the trip gets pretty chaotic and freaky. This can be a good or a bad thing, depending on your state of mind at the time.I admire the advant garde creativity of this album. But some of the experimental sounds just don't work on a musical level and the songwriting is generally not at the high level it would later reach.But the psychedelic jamming is certainly front and center, a distinguishing characteristic that made the Dead concert experience different from any other. So for most fans this will still be an essential record to have."
1,Nice people who can't sing,"I'm sure this group was lots of fun at parties and very pleasant conversationalists. However, they can't sing a note and can barely play their instruments. One of the worst records ever made, worse than Soft Machine, and that's saying something."
3,"Terrififc, Alot of fun",Love this game. It made me feel like a kid again.I can remember playing this on the bus to school.
5,Loved It To Death,This was the first lp that I ever bought and the first ACG recording that I ever purchased. This is before ACG became perhaps a little overexposed. Solid songs here and solid playing make this a pleaseure all these years later. The songs are just fun to listen to and fun to play if you're a guitarist. This was the first hit album from ACG and it still holds up well after all these years. Dark sounding and even sinister in places this is the way it was. Enjoy
5,Top 10 of all time,"Hey fellow aging Cooper heads as well as the next GENERATION LANDSLIDE of Fans waiting in the wings to keep the Light aliveThis was tough for me to pick my fave A.C. LP harder then the classics of (I.E. Janis Joplin, Boss, paaaaaaatti Smith, T-Rex but Alice has 5 Lps I can find NO fault in- I went with the first Alice LP I was turned onto as it sat on my LP Player for a good 6 months at least once a daye....also ""The Ballard of Dwight"", I'm 18, Is it my Body are true classic Rock songs- I wish he made it a double LP with Killer then it would be the making of a whole new genre -I BOW to Bob Ezrin for creating this sound which he then went on to follow Patti Smiths CLASSIC Horses LP (made with beauty and poetry and ROCK) to her 2nd LP ""Radio"" a complete departure (he did steal a few too many riffs from Alice on songs Like Ask the Angels , Pissing in the River but I guess he was still discovering his muse alsoRickster (Generation Landslide)"
4,Still needs the 5 star treatment!,"A very welcome addition to the vast Alice Cooper collection, but you can't help feeling an album of this stature deserves a real proper reissue, along the lines of the Billion Dollar Babies deluxe edition.The sound is fine, though not a big leap from the standard release it has to be said. I welcome any upgrade of this classic album from the original band. Booklet is pretty basic, but all original artwork is there.All in all, a good buy, but for Alice collectors only, as i it's not significantly better than the standard release in my opinion."
2,Just a collection of letters,"The collected stories in this book have little coherent organisation, no stellar writing to distinguish them, or other remarkable feature. They are no more, nor less than, a selection of letters from Norther Californians who had sex tales. It's little different than you might find in a liberated magazine, were you to collect the writings from a year or more."
2,About half good,"Thoroughly enjoyed the half about the Golden Gate Bridge. Really unbelievable. Eye opening, I had never heard anything like that about the bridge before.The half about her relationships and living in her city, not so much. The style showing scenes from all over the area were great at first, but then started to feel like a slide show. Slow paced, could have used a little more creativity. Overall, would not recommend. Too dry and artsy to be considered a documentary."
4,can associate the lives of the persons in this book,"As a genealogist, my paternal ancestors came from Germany through Texas. Reading this book, I can associate with their lives and hardships coming to America."
4,"Good Product, But Incorrectly Described","Well, what can I say about an engineer's scale? If you need one, this one will work fine for you. It's a good product. The only complaint I have is that it is not aluminum as it was described in the details when I bought it. I see now that they have changed it to read ""white plastic"", although another line in the details reads ""metal scale"". It also still says ""metal"" in the title.Go ahead and buy the scale. It will work well for you. Just be aware that it's plastic and not metal."
1,"Kids enjoy the show, but it's a poor transfer.","You know the story... the film is a faithful retelling. Costello dreams himself (as Jack) and fellow movie characters into the story. The narrative device recalls Dorothy's dream in The Wizard of OZ; it plausibly lands Lou and Bud in character. Be advised that in addition to annoying film artifacts, my Madacy disc was defective (a series of small depressed circles in a ring concentric with the spindle hole) and in the Passport edition, the video is worse still and then is poorly synched with the audio! Stay away from both if you can find better transfers."
3,Its ok,I got this thinking of a grand daughter who is six and a half and loves the story. It was over her head and I did not find it engaging.
2,Disappointing,"This is definately not one of Abbott and Costello's better offerings. There are still some good hearty laughter moments at Costello's antics but mostly it's slow moving and predicatable. And if this has actuallt been restored then I hate to think what kind of condition it was in before it was 'restored'. All in all for the price I got it at, it wasn't so bad I certainly wouldn't wanted to have paid full price for it. If you are a fan of Abbott and Costello you may want to buy it to complete your collection or becasue it was one of (if not) the only film that shot in colour, or because it was one of the movies produced by Costello's film company. If you want a good quality movie that will showcase Abbott and Costello's extaordinary talent then don't look here."
3,The Minority,"Looking at other reviews I seem to be the only person who doesn't like this book very much. I think that is mostly because it just isn't the sort of story I enjoy or identify with, and that may be partly because I have AS myself... I don't know. I think a lot of people would enjoy this book though, particularly women who have experienced failed relationships with AS men and who would identify with the author and may find it reassuring that the break down of the relationship was about mutual incompatibility rather than any failing on their part. However, I wouldn't recommend this as the first or only book you read on Asperger's Syndrome. This is just one person's story told from a specific perspective. It's good for what it is but I feel uncomfortable with the idea of people forming opinions about someone like me based solely upon it."
3,WHAT A NUTTER...,"Great LP; had it in college and smoked a ton to it. I got the chance to see Van and band in either 1973-74 at the Celbrity Theater in Phoenix, AZ. I went with my buddy Cincinati. We had a couple drinks at the dorm and smoked a fatty on the way to the show. What a dismal disappointment; Van comes out and the first thing out of this mouth is: ""I don't smoke, drink, or cuss, and I am not doing any of my hits; it you don't like it, that's tough"". I was stunned; ""you fat liar"", I thought. I threw my beer at him and was escorted out of the venue by 2 big goons. Nonetheless, when I listen to this album and all the great music on it, and Ronnie Montrose playing guitar, I just sit back and smile..."
4,Van Morrison goes country,"Many people are familiar with ""Wild Night"" the hit single from ""Tupelo Honey"" that was inexplicably covered by John Mellencamp a few years ago. Be forewarned, from there Morrison spends much of the rest of the album evoking the sounds of rural America, climaxing with ""Moonshine Whiskey,"" which extolls the virtues of ""southern love...deep in the heart of Texas."" There are some great songs here, none sweeter that the title track, which has recently been used in several films. Overall, a solid effort from a master artist."
5,good to start a basic vocab and concept,"This was a good book to start a basic vocab and concept of what would later be studied in the Chinese language. I use this book very frequently to start learning a new language and, the only thing that would be missing would be an audio guide to the book. Pronunciation in Chinese is very essential to the word and understanding of the language."
4,Great for education,My son received this at 2. Uses it more at age 3. He loves to play with the letters at the top and it has helped with recognizing the letters. He doesn't sit at it much. He prefers a desk with a real chair not a little stool. The letter tracing is good. Would recommend for 3 and older.
3,I prefer Plan Toys after seeing both,"After ordering both, I'm returning the RR sets for Plan Toys sets. RR sets are made in China, the wood isn't as soft and has that chemically treated smell (not super strong, but the PT sets have no odor whatsoever). You can see the glue, too. Plan Toys are just better all around. They don't farm out their labor and they are a very green company. Although I must admit, you can't beat how many pieces you get in a RR set and they are faaaaaaaar better than anything plastic! Also, incase you were wondering like me, the woods with both brands are so similar in color that they mix well. :)"
5,an outstanding compilation,"This compilation offers the best overview of David Bowie's first six years. None of the songs are run in chronological order, and that makes this album a great album as well as a piece of history. This album is far more comprehensive of David's material during this time period than is ""Changes Bowie"" or the ""Singles Collection."" This song offers 20 great songs that reflect the time period. From the all time famous ""Space Oddity"" to the errie ""Man who sold the World"" to ""Changes"" to ""Ziggy Stardust"" to ""Aladdin Sane,"" and to ""Diamond Dogs,"" this is the best retrospective of Bowie's early material."
5,This book did not cover anything on high beam switch.,I searched the entire book and found no infomation on how to service or troubleshoot the high beam switch. I did see the turn signal portion but no information on the high beam switch.
5,Most comfortable shoe I've ever worn,"I've had a set of these for two years now and on the drive into work this morning I realized I had to tell someone about them. I purchased a pair when a local store was going out of business and carried them. They run a size large (I'm an 9.5 and 8.5 shoes fit great). The leader is extremely soft and the sole is very unique. Walking over pebbles or small imperfections is almost unnoticeable, but not in any way which makes you feel you can't feel the ground. I've walked for hours wearing these shoes, and honestly they are the only shoe that doesn't make my feet hurt.If you want a pair of shoes that don't make you go ""aaah"" when you take them off after work, get a pair of J Shoes Mojave boots (a size smaller than usual). They're that comfortable."
2,Missing theme song,"The video quality is good, but the theme song is absent in this version as in many other DVD releases. Sometimes a different instrumental is played during the opening and closing, and other episodes have the theme music without the lyrics."
1,Item not as expected,The slot for dispensing the stamps is not appropriate and does not dispense efficiently. Would not recommend this item.
5,awesome,"I've listened to this every since i was little. this CD is perfect for me, Ozzy is my favorite artist of all time."
4,The birth of metal,"Occultisitic, maybe even satanic. So what- it's great music after all. Black Sabbath started their career with this gloomy release. Listen to the title song, a perfect example of creating emotions and atmospheres with music. Same clould be said about ""the Wizard"", wich offers a damn catchy harmonica riff. ""Evil Woman"" would fit perfectly on a Deep Purple album. ""N.I.B."", featuring another brilliant riff. But still, while the first five songs offer the top quality ""Sabbies"", the rest of the album suffers form too much jamming, sounding little unsensible , and, sad to say, boring. For example, ""The Warning"" begins promissingly, but ends up being twice too long to catch my admiration. Nevertheless, this is a very convincing album, and a start to it all. Enjoy."
4,The beggining of Heavy Metal!,"A total new way of ""rock"" in the earlies 70's... for me (and for a lot!) the beggining of a new style: Heavy Metal!"
2,Counterfeit,Songs out of order. Songs stop in the middle of the CD sometimes. This has just got to be a counterfeit item because the original has all the songs in order. Sorry Charlie We only pick the finest tuna.
5,For those who are about to experience - Black Sabbath!,"Church bells, thunder and lightning cracks. Welcome to the world of Black Sabbath. Bible black, cat eyed and terrible, enter into the dark side of your imagination through one of the greatest heavy metal meister-werkes of all times. Straight from the furnaces of the Black Country, this album was forged in steel, fire and rage, paranoia, eternal damnation and a hellish Austin Morris.This is a key album for all metal fans everywhere. As for Black Sabbath the band? actually a nice bunch of lads really.Go on, frighten the young Foggies if you dare!regards,martyn_jones@iniciativas.com"
4,THE FIRST HEAVY METAL ALBUM EVER,"WITHOUT THIS HEAVY METAL ALBUM IT IS HARD TO TELL HOW HEAVY METAL WOULD BE TODAY OR IF IT EVEN WOULD EXIST. NOT ONLY IS IT THE FIRST OF BLACK SABBATH'S 6 CLASSIC ALBUMS WITH OZZY, IT IS THE FIRST OF HEAVY METAL. IT WASNT LED ZEPPELIN OR DEEP PURPLE THAT STARTED HEAVY METAL IT WAS SABBATH. AS FOR THE ALBUM, IT STARTS OUT GREAT WITH 5 SOLID TRACKS( BALCK SABBATH, WIZARD, BEHIND THE WALL OF SLEEP, NIB, AND WICKED WORLD) BUT THE LAST ONE LOSES STEAM. MAYBE IF IT WASNT FOR THE BEAUTIFUL COVER ILLUSTRATION I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT 3 AND ONE HALF STARS"
5,Unbelievable power from Metal Heavyweights,"This thing is the first heavy metal album. It is incredible. I really don't know what else to say. It is a must-have album for fans of metal, for old fans to give to fans of new metal, and say,""guess what? It's been done better, and a long time ago, too"" This album rips."
5,Great piece...,"""Black Sabbath"" is a fantastic album from their early days in England. The rythms on this album are like none other, if you like Black Sabbath, this is a great buy! I could listen to tracks 3-6 and especially ""N.I.B."" for hours. Every bit as good a paranoid. :-)"
5,KORN DIDN'T INVENT ANYTHING!,"I'm sick of all these kids who think Nu Metal is ""soooo original"" and think they know better. ""Black Sabath"" is the first metal album and it's a lot more diverse than your Korny. Tell me how metal could have been created in 1994 if we already had 1/4 century of metal like Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Saxon and many more...?Now shut up and go slit your wrist!"
2,small,when I got this book I didn't realize how extremely small the book was. I needed to get this book for an assignment (paper) for one of my college classes. good thing I have 20/20 vision or it would have been an evern more of a struggle to read it.
3,Is this Dostoevsky's best?,"I'd like to know from other readers if this is Dostoevsky's best book. Over a period of years, I've read C&P, The Idiot, and The Gambler. The Idiot I remember as being profound - but I read it at an innocent 16 (I should read it again). By contrast, C&P seemed far less challenging, but in many ways more complete. What do other readers think? I'd be particularly keen to hear about those books by Dostoevsky I hadn't read."
5,Crime and Punishment,"I thought that Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment was a great book. It was suspenseful, captivating, and well-written. The characters seemed very real and life-like. It was very graphic and detailed, describing even to the last of the feelings of Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov before, during, and after the murder. The details of the scenes of the murder, the police station, and the trampling of Marmeladov were very explicit and well-written. The only bad points of the book are the use of Old English spelling and grammar, and that the story is sometimes hard to follow. The book has excellent detail and was captivating and full of suspense. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to tackle the 493 pages. Overall, it was a good book."
5,Wow,This is the most excellent book I have ever read. Dostoevsky truly captures the mind of a tortued young man who is going through many things because of his experience. This truly shows the human soul in both forms of good and evil that exsist in all of us. Dostoevsky really understands the human mind
2,Product mislabeled.,"Editorial reviews on the current page (Crime and Punishment [Kindle Edition]) indicate that it's the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation. In fact, it's a translation by Constance Garnett."
4,Great,"I am 17 and for a first time reader of this book, I was surprised byt the alteration in vocabulary that has taken place sine the 1880's. I enjoyed the story very much and it was only dull if you have a lazy mind. The intensity of the thought process that Fyodor D. goes into depth with is so amazing and I just love it. This novel is helpful also in the understanding of your own conscience and reminds you how you need to listen to it or you will start a punishment that can lead one to insanity."
4,Better Than Expected,"I have a paperback copy of this very book, by the same translator, and, although I expected misprints, missing words, or worse based on some of the reviews I've seen of it, I was pleasantly surprised to find it a very faithful recreation of the original. As far as the content, I like this translation for readability. Other translations may be more ""true"" to the Russian, but that doesn't necessarily make them any more enjoyable. And of course, the price is right. I'd encourage anyone to pick this book up. Another beauty of the digital version is, you don't have to have a dictionary nearby if some of the words are unfamiliar, as you can use the built-in dictionary. Totally enjoyable."
3,Crime and Punishment,"I am reading this because I'm assisting in teaching a High School class on Russian Literature. I have read about 60% so far and although the story is intriguing, it is a little difficult to follow and the many Russian names confuse me at times.The Kindle download is very good and I get back to where I want to go (often I back up and reread a chapter)easily.The picture the story tells of life in Russia 100 years ago is very interesting. NOTE: This is NOT an ""easy read"" but I think the struggle I'm having will be worth it!"
4,A classic I actually like,This is one of the few celebrated classics that I have been able to get into and actually enjoy. The story set in 18th century Russia is still relevant today because it makes you think about questions of morality and about life in a busy and congested city as opposed to any country side
2,CRIME AND PUNISHMENT,"I love the book but miss a table of contents. Also, the chapters just begin in the middle of the page so I do not like that.Of course, the price was right but I wish I had known how barebones it was."
2,An over-rated classic,"I expected a lot more from this book than I got out of it. I liked Brothers Karamazov very much but I found Crime and Punishment to be pretty annoying, without any payoff. We have to follow the convoluted mind of a moron. The police detective just assumes that he will confess sooner or later because he's a gentleman, not a poverty-stricken crook. What's that about? Why the hell would you assume that a murderer would confess? Must we suspend our disbelief and our common sense before opening the book? Raskolnikov is an annoying person to read about, and I don't find him terribly realistic either. If he is such an idealist, why doesn't he regret, most of all, killing the shy lady? Why does he forget her as soon as he dispatches her? And that ending - I'm not going to spoil it for you but I'll just say I don't believe it. After reading this thoroughly mediocre book I was really amazed at how good Brothers Karamazov is."
1,Pseudo intelectual by a racist writer,"The only people who should read this book are people who belong to so called ' intelectual' parties, or people who have commited terrible crimes - it can replace death as ' The Capital Punnishment' .If you're intrested in good literature, smart writing, character analysis, ANYTHING... search elsewhere.If you shot your Teacher for forcing you to read this, you have my sympathy"
5,What could be more powerful than a Russian?,"no one talks of money better tha Dostoevsky. Once again, I am amazed with the general surroundings and family setting this book offers. Where else could you find such a taunt read? No where."
2,LAME Cow,"this is just a really cheap product that has ""record company cash-in"" all over it. true, it does have their most popular songs on it, but 11 tracks? from a punk band? it can't be much more than like 15 minutes long. i suppose if 'punk rock girl' and 'bitchin' camaro' are the only songs you're interested in, then this is right down yr alley. however, ""death rides a pale cow' is a much better compilation of songs, and provides a pretty good career retrospective(although legal wrangling among Hollywwod and Restless records prevented any songs to appear from 'soul rotation' and 'not richard but dick'). 'cream of the crop' is like one of those crappy beach boys or beatles 'greatest hits' collections that are like 10 songs that they sell at rite-aid or cvs. so if yr the kind of person who buys their music at a pharmacy, this cd is for you."
2,Might be ok for a beginner,"I enjoyed using pimsleur for every language to useAside from the price tag, the biggest con is that even after finishing all the levels of pimsleur is that you are still a beginnerTried this, ""learn like crazy,"" and ""Story time language learning""If you've done level 1 of pimsluer, i recommend using ""Story time"" (its a download product here on amazon)They sell one lesson at a time and it is much faster paced than pimsluerit was apperantly developed for people who have already completed another language programafter comaparing the two, you could finish levels 1-4 of pimsleur and you would still need to start on lesson 1 with ""Story Time""try itits only 2 bucks a lessoni'm hoping they start releasing more lessons as it seems that what ever they have out is incompletehere is the 1st lesson of ""Story Time"" You might have trouble searching for itSpanish Lesson Acheers"
2,Pimsleur - Spanish,"I would listen to this over and over and still can hardly say hello and how are you in Spanish. Don't blame the tapes. I think I need to see things in print to be able to speak them. That's how I learned French in College. Thinking of taking a college course in Spanish - writing emphasis. After I can write it, I can speak it."
4,caucasion family..,"I liked having more people for my house to play with. I thought it was strange that the people all had blue eyes. My mom took some paint and made the little boy and mom's eyes brown, just like ours. I liked that I could have them look like my family, afterall. I wish the clothes were more modern. My gramma's don't look or dress that old, or have gray hair! The grampa was perfect, except he needs glasses."
5,good gift,I bought this book for my son who collects W.E.B. Griffin books. I was happy to find this one at a reasonable price!
2,Looks great until you load it up..,"I bought this to hold all my DVDs and video game disks. It looks great, was easy to assemble and has a great presence in a room. Unfortunately, the shelves that go into the bookcase are very thin and flimsy, and sag even without anything on them. When half-full, they look ready to snap out of the case."
1,"Poor, biased work.","Very dissapointing book. the author is an apologist for circumcision and presents only one side, and an outdated side at that."
1,Ridiculous,This book is a joke. He gives outdated and useless data. Yes is may help prevent UTI's but that's basically it. Girls get them all the time and most people are against mutilating their genitals. It really is a humane rights issue. Do you respect you son as a person? Let HIM make the decision is he should alter his body or not. Unnecessary cosmetic surgery on infants. SIMPLE.
4,Finally the other side of the debate,"Although quite one sided the book was a much needed cotribution the circumcision debate. It contains a heavy amount of information, and is a must read for mothers making the circumcision decision, please dont just listen to anti circumcision arguments, read this book and make an informed decision"
1,So flawed that it's worthless,"I'd love to read a well-written, factual book on the positive aspects of circumcision. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be one. For scientific information, Morris relies on studies that are generally recognised to be outdated, flawed, or spurious. He bases much of his work on science that has been thoroughly repudiated.The anecdotal evidence is somewhat better -- but contains very obvious editorial bias. The author has blatantly cherry-picked information to fit his conclusion, and presented it in such a slanted, propagandist fashion that it's almost impossible to take seriously.For those who feel that the circumcision debate could use a well-reasoned 'in favor' argument, look elsewhere. I was very disappointed in that this book is so easily debunked."
5,Very good!,"The Quartet Kodaly never disappointed me. This recording is in the same level of other famous recordings. The advantage is that this is a great cd cheap and with good quality.What surprised me most is the clarity in the Kodaly, the obsession with perfection."
4,The next best thing to being there,"The Dead will always be known as the quintesential touring band of all time. No studio album could possibly convey the magic that arose from their live performances. Sure, some shows were better than others, but above it all there was always a feeling of goodwill, a feeling of ""being part of"" something wonderous, and the feeling that anything was possible at least for the moment.That said, ""Workingman's Dead,"" along with a handful of other Dead studio albums,""American Beauty"" being one, showcases the band's deeply rooted blues/folk/pop tradition that typified the band's best work. Throwing on this CD on a lazy weekend may just be the next best thing to being there."
1,Probably Better Than Nothing,"This book seems to be to be a mock-up that accidentally got bound and sold before it had a chance to be edited by either the author or the publisher. It is filled with typos--English, not Polish, which I am not qualified to judge; contradictory dates; phrases, such as ""Golden Freedoms,"" repeated but never explained; map borders overlaid on one another so it is impossible to see what's going on; legends missing on the maps. As a result, I am leery of its historical and geographical accuracy too, and feel I will have to double and triple check it against other sources before I can trust it."
1,This CD is just not worth the time it takes to listen to it.,"Sorry, but the music on this CD is just not good. As other reviewers mentioned, the IDEA behind the CD is good. But the MUSIC is very different indeed.Christine Giuliano's voice lacks depth and is, at best, mediocre. And such a lackluster voice does not justify the purchase of the CD- plain and simple. With the same [money] that this unimpressive CD commands, you can buy a CD from a woman with an astounding voice, such as Susan Greenbaum or Christina Aquilera.[...] And again, the idea behind this CD was good, but the performer's voice just isn't worth the money."
2,'Best Of Heavy Metal' (BMG Special Product) Various Artists,"Only reason I'm giving this various artists ten track disc a two-star rating is because of the price. I mean sure, there are cool '80's metal classics here from the likes of UFO, Motorhead, Overkill, Saxon and W.A.S.P. But, UNLESS you're either totally 'new' to '80's metal, a poser or one of those lame-o music fans that CAN'T even name two actual song titles by one (or more) of your 'favorite' bands, then I suggest you purchase the proper CD reissue these tunes came off of. One type I cannot stand are music fans that are TOTAL music illiterate. Augh!"
2,Greatly Dissapointing,"After buying Global 2 and 3, I quickly bought the fourth installment, finding that just because the label had putt out descent music in the past doesn't mean that it will be their tradition. This cd I have had for at least a month, buying it the moment I saw it, and yet I have listened to it maybe four times. Compared to other cds I've recently purchased it lack totaly in comparison. The music seems slow moving, and Highly boaring. It doesn't produce pictures in my head, move my body, or send me into a lethargic world. All I do is skip around it hoping that eventually I will learn to like it."
3,leeds united marching on together,"with robert pollard he does what it says on the tin .been a fan for a good while now ,he needs to stop churning out the cds for the sake of it .how ever like this sound anyway."
3,Very stylish but not quite true to size,Really loved the look of these and the price was definitely right. But I found them to be a bit too small. I'm usually a true 11.5 but these left absolutely no room in the toe even though the toebox is fairly generous. Breaks my heart but these have to go back.
5,I thought it was wonderful!,"I don't think that anyone who gave this book a bad rating actually read the book. It's a refreshing, fun and well-written novel by one of the best authors ever. As for writing classes, this author certainly doesn't need any!!!!!!"
5,I Gotcho... Good!!,"My brother was delighted with this CD and he keeps playing it for all of his visitors, it hasn't left hus CD Player since it arrived. I was so glad to find this disc, at a reasonable price as well. The seller got it to me so quyickly too!"
5,There is nothing like a grateful dead concert.,"Every time I hear this album, I am envious of those who were lucky enough to be there for the halcyon days of the dead. From the mindbending Dark Star to the superlative St. Stephen>Eleven, what more could you have asked for? But, then begin the first notes of Lovelight, and I can envision Pigpen strolling out from stage left (where he stood in those days), grabbing the microphone and belting out THE SONG (Lovelight) on this album. If you want to hear someone give his heart and soul to the music, just listen to this song. No wonder he and Janis were soul mates. Indeed, even Jerry loosens up and lets us hear it from his soul on Death Don't ... Amazingly enough, this compilation of songs spanned performances from 1/26/69 to 3/2/69. It goes to show you how incredible this band was playing during this period. GET THIS ALBUM, then get the bootlegs from this period."
2,noodling that goes nowhere,"Back in the early 70s, a friend whose opinion I had great respect for, told me this was ""the best album ever recorded."" So I went out and bought it. I wish I had borrowed his instead, and saved the money. (I know that no band has a more loyal following than the Dead, but frankly, I've never been able to catch the vision.) This recording, like all Dead recordings, at least in my ear, sounds like pointless ""noodling"" combined with weak vocals and mediocre songs. If I want to listen to some JAMMING, give me the Allman Brothers FILLMORE CONCERTS! (Of course, if you eat enough good LSD, ANYTHING sounds good, right?!?)"
4,Gentle Intro to Python.,"The book's title probably has been chosen to attract attention. That said, it is an excellent book. The standard book, Programming Python by Mark Lutz, may bog neophytes down.The first half of the book is an introduction to the language and the second half applications loosely connected to the Internet.The language is worth knowing, but I'd have liked a book with exercises."
2,Too shallow,I was very disappointed when the roaster buffet trays arrived. They were very shallow. I sent them back.
4,If you know you're...,"a civilian, you aren't one. A fine coming of age story with special appeal for military brats of all persuasions. Conroy hits the low and the high points with painful accuracy. Especially worth a read in these troubled times, if your own experience has not let you peer into the closed world of the military and their families. A good, fast read, that stands up to a second inspection. Better than the film."
2,Over the Top,"A rare instance when the movie is more enjoyable than the book. The constant sibling rivalry was humorous until around page 75, then it became too much to bear. You won't miss anything by skipping the back and forth teen dialogue. Can't imagine that the conversations as written hadn't already occurred several times in their past. Thought the old saying, ""and so's your old man"" would have been better. Same for Santini and the constant barrage of over the top manliness. Sophomoric at best. See the movie and forget the book."
2,Arm sleeve with little protection,"I was not impressed with the product. I tried it on, and although it fit comfortably the padding was so thin that while testing it, even light hits from my kids were able to be felt through the Hexpad. To top it off, after I returned the product, I found it at a local sports store for half the price."
3,ok,"not super padded but i bought them for a Bane Halloween costume so.... as far as fighting in them, well, IDK. They don;t seem likethey would cushion too much of a blow."
3,I want to love this album......,"I want to love this album. I was very glad to hear that Chamberlin was back in the band. However... this album still can not get under my skin. I love the Pumpkins, one of my favorite groups , but I just can't get into as much as I wish I could. It is wonderfull but does not deserve 5 stars to me. It's a little high of production value for me. I think the high production overshot what the Pumpkins are trying to get across. But if you love the Pumpkins, do buy it, it is worth it. My friends ( all hardcore Pumpkins fans) love it, but I just can't see what they see I guess."
2,Pumpkins have changed. But is it for the better?,"I'm one of those Pumpkins fans that fell in love with Gish and Siamese Dream. Even though I'm glad Chamberlain is back as the drummer (his presence was dearly missed), the Pumpkins lack the melodies and musical talent that they have shown in the past. Seems to me that in the early days, it was only about the music. Now the band is a commercial figure with a bald headed lead singer that is promoting more of an image than music itself. In the old Pumpkins music, Billy Corgan only sang when he had to which let the music shine through. And when he did sing, he wasn't screaming his lungs out like he does these days."
5,Listen to this a second or a third time if you are in doubt.,"At first I had to get used to the production sound of this cd, which is not really clean more ""dusty"" and a bit electronic. Also I missed exiting riffs and exiting melodies. BUT the third time the quarter fell: You have to go through the clouds to really see the beauty behind!I'm happy that I kept trying and that bands like the Pumpkins, STP, Live and Rage keep the fire burning!"
4,Impressive,"I've learned that if I like a Pumpkins song the first time I hear it, a month down the road I will love it. Pumpkins grow on you like no other band.I was really impressed with Machina the first time through. That means the closer I listen, the more I will be amazed. This one will be in my player for a long time to come.Try, Try, Try seems to be one of my favorites, along with Stand Inside Your Love and The Imploding Voice. Still to early to really say, though.Another great album from an amazing band. And I don't care what anyone says, Adore was a good album, too."
1,Worst Pumpkins By Far,I am a big fan and this album was a huge disapointment. Not one enjoyable song. Barely any listenable songs. Will never buy a Pumpkins album without hearing it again.
3,Too little too Late,"After having this album for a couple months now, I tried and tried to get it to grow on me, but simply put it is too long and somewhat boring. There are a few songs that are worthy of their past efforts (stand,this time) , but as a whole Billy and the gang have written a very inconsistent album. A lot of the songs should have been turned into b-sides and should not be on here . It is too bad that this band will not move on, but maybe it means Billy will start something new and adventurous. Get this album only if you really liked their last album 'adore', if you only like 'Gish' and 'Siamese Dream' this album is not for you...........the best cuts on the album are: 3. Stand Inside Your Love 4. I Of The Mourning 8. This Time 9. Imploding Voice, The.......WARNING! THIS ALBUM IS ONLY FOR SMASHING PUMPKINS FANS"
2,machina - not much to be desired.,"machina - the machines of god is, in my opinion, quite likely the worst pumpkins release to date. the songs are for the most part boring and unmelodic. (and this coming from a die-hard pumpkins fan!) even adore had fairly strong melodies throughout. also, machina was promised to be the pumpkins striking back at the world that scorned them. it was touted to be their new rock and roll anthem. i find this album almost completely devoid of rock, with few exceptions (i.e.-the everlasting gaze, heavy metal machine). the pumpkins seem to have lost their flair for beautiful riff-based songs. listen to siamese dream and then compare with the new machina. the new release has virtually no catchy guitar hooks. i understand the princeple of musical evolution, but i think that we've lost the pumpkins that we'd come to know and love. they've de-volved into something that, quite frankly, i just don't understand or appreciate."
5,Reunited and feelin' great!,"Understandibly, i was a little scared buying this record. i was a huge pumpkins fan and was horribly dissapointed by adore, although it had its moments. Well, let me just say that THEY ARE INDEED BACK and kickin' it MUCH like the olden days, if not exactly. It was a GREAT GREAT move to let Jimmy back in, because he rocks, and i think he was part of the influence to make this a heavy cd. I think the best songs are: the everlasting gaze, stand inside your love, the sacred and profane, heavy metal machine, and the crying tree of mercury. and those are the BEST songs on the record. the rest are great too, although glass and the ghost children is pretty long and rambling, but that's a pretty good song, too. they have really interesting song titles and the music is great too. 5 stars!"
5,Let's be realistic here....,"firstly, to all those who complain that Mellon Collie should have been a 1 cd album... um, all the GOOD songs are ON THERE! Just skip past the ones you you don't like. I'd prefer to get the b-sides first up rather than having to buy singles to get them...Anyway, back to Machina. Certainly a return to form. Surely ""I of the Mourning"" and ""Age of Innocence"" are 2 of the best SP songs around? I'm not going to make some pretentious comment about the album's musical style because I'm not a know it all Rolling Stone critic - all I can say is that most of the songs are brilliant (except nos. 10-12) and I like what I hear. Nothing wrong with coming up with something ""we've all heard before"" - Stephen King didn't make a fortune by switching over to romance novels. Hopefully we'll hear more from SP for many years to come."
4,Machina : An album from god,"After a disapointing follow up to Melon Colle with Adore , the Pumpkins have delivered an album which again showcases the talents of Billy Corgan . Jimmy Chamberlin's drumming is fantastic and adds a lot to the record . For any fan of the Pumpkins this is essential ."
4,THE NEW ALBUM,"I THINK MACHINA IS A STEP UP FROM THEIR LAST ALBUM ADORE. DIE-HARD FANS WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! ONE FINAL NOTE, THE ATLANTA BRAVES ARE GOING TO WIN THE WORLD SERIES IN 2000."
1,Dead songs alright,"I saw one reviewer here putting it exactly right: all the songs on Machina are dead. They're deadborn babies, even the 'rocking' tracks like Everlasting Gaze. The track doesn't rock; it rocks in a shallow way. There's not a drop of passion behind it.Tired, uninspired. It's really shocking to hear Machina. Heavy Metal Machine is the worst; is this a parody? Just as worse as Crying Tree Of Mercury; a song so revolting and bombastic I'm ashamed to listen to it. The only really good song is Stand Inside Your Love, but you can buy the single too.I was extremely looking forward to Machina, especially because The first albums were so incredible and then suddenly Adore was such a letdown. I read Machina was The Pumpkins back to form. If this is back to form, than I am Queen Elizabeth. It's a good thing they quit."
5,So good!,"I love this album! Billy Corgan really writes the most beautiful songs in rock. This band is truly an orginal. If you don't like this music you truly have no passion, because this album is all about passion, love, loss, and life! SO THERE!"
3,"I've tried, tried, tried, but couldn't connect to album","""I of the Morning"" is a standout track that both lyrically and musically gives me goosebumps it's so good. And ""Age of the Innocene"" creeps up on you at the end and smacks you on the face after Corgan whispers ""Blue skies bring tears"" about a million times into your ear (gets a little annoying after a couple dozen listens, especially when you can't get up and press fast-forward on the cd player).But yeah...""I of the Morning"" song I will play for my future kids in 20 years. beautiful, rockin, gentle and intense all at the same time. the way love should be. drumming is amazing. glad jimmy's back, he sounds better than ever."
3,well.......,"Well.....Out of the entire cd I think about only 4 songs caught my attention.""Everlasting gaze"",""This time around"",""stand inside your love"",and""age of innocence"".Dont get me wrong.I think all the songs are excellent in there own way I just think they are just trying to hard to please themselves.They are trying to hard to be different.When Corgan said rock is dead I think he meant he was tired of being stepped on when the band tried a different sound.There for Rock was dead.. to him.We all just have to get yoused to the fact that we are no longer in 1995 when ""Mellon Collie""had just come out, and when where still feeling the effects from ""Siamese"".They are different now whether we like it or not,musically and emotionally.Maybe we are too"
3,what happened?,"after the beautiful and experimental Adore, this is a bit of a let down. It seems that Billy and co. are only interested in the almightly dollar, not advancing musically and lyrically. Its a shame, because although some of the songs on this album are good, it sounds like they are trying to relive 1993-95 all over again. Shame on SP fans who didn't think Adore ""rocked out"" enough, and didn't buy it. This is the result. One step forward, two steps back."
3,where's that mellon collie sound?,"ok, machina is a good album. it has catchy songs and good lyrics.but, there's something missing, the rage, the natural emotion billy corgan could transmite with mellon collie and even with adore. they're good, but they're not awesome. hole could just as easily make a record like this one, and this is not a good thing."
5,My pick 4 album of the year,"People constantly talk about how the Pumpkins will never make a better CD than ""Siamese Dream"" or ""Mellon Collie...."". They may be right, those were incredible CD's that had an enormise impact on my life. But, this CD is (in my opinion) right up there. Billy Corgan's lyrics are always the best you can't top them but in this CD the lyrics have more hope and cheer than the usual depressing lyrics. It would be wrong to deny that Corgan is an absolute genius. As for the rest of the band, they have developed a lot of chemistry and have learned how to work with each other."
5,A great farewell for their fans,"After D'arcy announced that she was going to leave the band right before the album was released, it was all but inevitable that this would be the last album. They made Machina II, but never released it. Machina: the machines of god, though was a good way to descend from the music scene. After Adore, which dissapointed many, this is a nice change back. All songs are relatively worth listening to, except, in my opininon for, Raindrops + Sunshowers and Wound, but a great album none the less."
1,Really Bad,"I have liked the Smashing Pumpkins since they first came out with ""Gish"". I was one of the first to wear that ugly purple shirt with that rocket-thingee on it. As a long-time fan of this band I have to say it was a huge disappointment. I thought having Jimmy back on drums would have given this band a kick, brought them back to their roots and out of their electronic-induced haze. If anything his drums were mixed WAY too loud. This album is not what the critics say. I have read reviews that say ""the Smashing Pumkins are back with their rock sound."" This album is way too electronic and way too little rock. It's not even something I can say that I'd have to get used to, I can't. There are maybe three solid songs on this album. If you are a fan of ""Gish,"" ""Siamese Dream"" or ""Mellon Collie..."" you will hate this album. Evolving is one thing but this is another. Don't know if it's a Flood influence or if Billy is bored. Wait to buy it used if you must have it. Not worth the 9.99 we paid for it."
3,"Let's be honest, Prog-rock or not, this is not up to S.P.'s previous standards","I am a massive Smashing Pumpkins fan, and I am also a musician who loves Prog rock/metal. That being said, Machina is creative and the drums are commanding, but this is not up to previous Smashing Pumpkins standards(with the exception of Stand Inside Your Love). Machina ii was a much more solid effort, I just wish it would have had a CD release."
2,Heavy Metal Mess...,"trying too hard to shift gears due to the underwhelming response to adore, corgan and co. turn up the amps andfeedback. but in this case, you can't go home again.the problem? the pumpkins were growing from record to record up to this point. while adore wasn't as consistent as gish OR mellon collie, at least it was something different. at its best, adore was astonishing. songs like ""the tale of dusty and pistol pete"" or ""crestfallen"" are right up there with corgan's best work.machina is going backwards to prove they're still a rock band. and what it really proved to be was the end of the pumpkins. a few good tracks (""try, try"", ""age of innocence"") get lost in a bloated, 73-minute opus...SP were one of the best, and most important, bands of the nineties - right up there with nirvana, alice in chains,radiohead and soundgarden. but machina shows few, if any,signs of that...- cRAIG"
4,Decent!,"This product wasn't what I expected but it was still a great present for my sister, I'd recommand these to anyone! Was a great product!"
3,Adequate on the law; suffers from poor editing,"I have to use this book as the text for a class I teach in Employment Law (i.e., non-collective-bargaining law) to students matriculating to a Master of Science Degree in Human Resources. The text adequately surveys the law, but suffers from terrible proofing and editing; it also needs an update, because the 1994 edition obviously was not written any later than early 1993, based on the omission of certain important U.S. Supreme Court cases from 1994 and since. The book also suffers from an extremely strong pro-management tone; a more balanced approach would serve the untutored reader better. There are better books, such as the ABA Guide, which I commend to potential readers of this book."
5,WeLove it ! but be aware...,"This is a very big,simple and wonderful all wood doll house, with none of the fuss of some of the ""Victorian"" models, and it has withstood much play. I bought it for a 5 year old,but my 10 year old and her friend seem to play with it the most,so it seems to have a wide age appeal. I can see why one reviewer referred to is as a ""doll house kit"",as it is very plain. I personally think, that the basic design and openness is really one of it's most attractive features.Be aware,although you can buy the doll house,many of the ""Ryan's rooms home is where the heart is"" house accessories/add-on have been discontinued,such as the Ryan's Room Park and Play Garage Set ,Ryan's Room let's decorate,as well as the RR balcony. So if you are just happy with the doll house as is, and don't want the add -ons you won't be disappointed."
1,The Worst book ever!,Like five inches square with 70 pulpwood pages of goofy thoughts seldom reaching funny. Absolutely worthless.
1,Complete Garbage,"I will not waste much time or effort here, but will suffice to say that this book is a waste of time and money. The only relatively funny passages are the very few shown on back of the book's cover. The body of the book is empty, light, and altogether foolish. A sad excuse for a comedy book. Please don't waste your money on this item."
3,Nice little unit,"I got this to watch football on the computer using the roof antenna that I use for my main TV. I got plenty of channels with it but could not get CBS or KTLA out of LA. They are from the same location as NBC and ABC which it picked up. Instructions say to enter frequency for searching for a specific channel but it requires an exact frequency as in 23590 not the channel number of 2 or 11. Since I can not seem to find out what these frequencies are anywhere on the internet I can not use that feature to look for a channel. So no football on this unit and I will have to try another unit. Worked great for the channels I found which was (4.1,4.2,4.3 NBC) (7.1,7.2,7.3 ABC) and some PBS stations."
5,Terrifyingly true.,"I live about 1 mile from Bobby Mackey's. I know of what goes on in there and have visited the place a few times. While nothing has ever happened to me, I do know people who have had ""encounters"". I read the book and read about places that I know exist and people who I either know or know of. This book tells the truth from what I have heard from first hand accounts. Of course, when you get a couple drinks in a bunch of urban cowboys, you never know what might happen."
2,Could have been much better.,"I read about this book on the internet and couldn't wait to get it. I did and was really disappointed. The author uses way, way, too many unnecessary adjectives. I expected at any time the narrative to become ""he went and then she went and then he went..."" I think the book needs to be edited. Some better pictures would have been nice too."
1,Guess I'm not enough Deadhead,"'Cause I just can't ""hear"" this music.Garcia was a musical genius, but maybe this albumis a bit too self absorbed, for certain it's too advanced for me.For others maybe a hit, for me, a big miss."
4,the Dead at their finest in the studio!,"Aoxomoxoa is the best Dead studio album. Period. Imagine the California folk-rock scene if you will...add to it a taste of psychedelia and a dash of experimentation and you get this wonderfully crafted Grateful Dead album. There is no doubt the Dead were at their finest when live, but this studio album shows what the band is capable of when they really sit down and work. The problem with many of the Dead's studio attempts was their lack of focus, but this album is a diamond in the ruff. Often overlooked and under appreciated, it's a Dead classic to be reckoned with. Grab your lava lamp and your incense...your in for a trippy ride into the world of the Dead!!!"
1,junk,"This toy was the biggest disappointment. I had one as a kid and had a lot of fun with it, so I bought one for my son. You can't even wind it up, its too hard to turn the dial. I think someone bought the rights to it and made it out of cheap parts. This crap is not worth one dollar much less anything higher. Seemed like a great idea, but it turned out to be the worse toy that I have ever bought."
2,pastry & pizza roller,Son in law wasn't to thrilled with this product. I purchased it for him for christmas.
5,"Peter, Paul and Mommy","During a recent visit, my three year-old granddaughter asked me what my record player was. I took her to my collection of 331/3 LPs and selected Peter, Paul and Mommy - the 1969 vinyl edition. ""Oh,Grannie,"" she said, ""a big DVD!"" She loved ""Momma's Taking Me to The Zoo Tomorrow"" and ""Puff the Magic Dragon."" I had forgotten all the great songs that were on this album.,,,hadn't played it for years. We really enjoyed it together. So I purchased this CD just for her...she lives in the UK...and I'm always looking for good ways to keep in touch."
5,A Must-Have. . . . .Never Gets Old,"Just go ahead and buy this album! Every song is wonderful, and we have not tired of the songs even after what must be 50 listenings. This is the one album that the grown-ups have enjoyed as much as the child, in our house. You won't regret getting these tunes stuck in your head. The album includes the best rendition of ""I have a song to sing - O"" that I've ever heard. These are all songs that you'll want your child to know and love. If you buy your child only one album, make it this one!"
3,Relaxing for the little guy,"Good cd. It's different from the usual head shoulders knees and toes or the kids yelling music. It doesn't knock my socks off which is why I gave it three stars. I was also hoping the little one would dance and enjoy it a bit more. I love the first song Marvelous Toy and of course Puff the Magic Dragon is always a hit. The rest in between are ok. There is one song that is kind of disturbing, can't remember which one it is, but if I switch the music to listen by ipod, I will be sure to omit it."
3,New age fluff added to lovely nature and chantng,"Title pretty much says it. I am sure some people don't mind synthetic flute sounds, super high reverb levels, and other elements of over production typical of new age spiritual music. But for me it is a bit too far removed from the spirit of ayahuasca. I will use it during a ceremony to see how it feels, but kind of disappointed overall."
3,This is only a warning,"The LAGQ are fine players, and the music here is first rate as a summary of what they do, or for any purpose. HOWEVER, the transfer to CD on my disc was very poorly chosen, so that the top octave and a half was mostly missing (worse on some pieces than others, though). This takes the snap! out of guitar strings and notably attenuates your ability to tell what the 4 are doing with guitar timbre and the like. So, if you have wide-range audio gear, you might want to look elsewhere for an introduction to these players."
2,shark vibration alarm watch,"Got this watch to swim laps but do not reliably feel the vibration while swimming. Hard to read the time in dim light and the illumination button is multifunction so may change some of the other settings when you hit it. Also, there is an hourly chime/vibration which is automatically turned on with the alarm -kept me up a good part of the night until I figured out what it was. Also no lap counter."
5,EWTN: A Network Gone Wrong,"This book explains good. Now, I understand that mother angelinca is somewhat evil and has two faces since the smoke of Satan broke in Vatican in 1960. She (angelinca) tried to teach about Orthodox and others to Catholics on EWTN tv. That is not right. Now, I am at 50 of 200 pages. I will read it all later. First, I read the Secret still hidden. Catholics, you should read it."
2,Hold out for better if you can,"These are really rough copies with no attempt being made to restore tinting. Add to that some truly annoying piano scores that don't seem to go with the pictures at all. If you want The Mark of Zorro, Image Entertainment has a MUCH better DVD available with a Gaylord Carter score. Unfortunately, I'm not aware of Don Q being on DVD elsewhere. If you're a movie junkie and have to have this, be prepared to turn it down and humm along."
1,Don Q Son of Zorro,"This movie, I purchased ,as a gift. So, I can not rated it. The person, I purchased for, said, he liked. So, I am sure, it was okay."
3,Mixed Feelings,"Is this a delicious product? Yes, it tastes great on anything, pasta, pizza, steak, eggs, you name it. Is it worth $22+? Not in my opinion. This oil is infused with truffle essence, its not olive oil that has real truffles added to it as many chefs, particularly in europe, still prepare it. It does taste good but for 3.5 ounces (less than half a cup!) its simply not worth it for me. It's not even the money that bothers me but I feel kind of guilty spending so much on so little on a product that is probably not very costly to produce. If I was buying real trufflesor a fine wine it would be another story but I would look at other similar products for less, the producers must be making an incredible margin of profit on this."
1,ROBBINS' LOWEST SCORE! by M. Boucher,"What could have been a great epic about the earlier days of filmaking has turned out to be a dreadful, overlong, uninteresting mishmash that even die hard fans will hate. Read THE CARPETBAGGERS instead, which deals with the same subject, and is a far better book."
3,Other Books,"The Dream Merchants, are, of course, the lords of Hollywood. Having worked there, this is a favorite subject of Harold's, but this book is not as good as the Carpetbaggers.It is full of the shenanigans that go on, what you have to do to get into films, to get them made, all that sort of thing, from earlier Hollywood times."
1,Nice Machine but Bad Options,"These machines are great, unfortunately the coffee used in the Douwe Egberts pods is horrible. I was going to get rid of my machine until a friend brought over some different pods. I suggest spending a little extra money and buying quality pods - the difference is markedly different. I personally buy mine from www.familyroast.com as they have a cool story but lots of people are making pods that fit this machine now. For what its worth - I hope it helps."
4,Good little lights,Nice set of lights. Good dispersion in water. Only gripe is the length of the cord from the first light to the sensor. Needs to be about twice as long ( 6/8 ft 12/16 ) to reach into bigger ponds from the wall socket.
3,Not Very Bright,"The lights came packaged as described. However, they are not very bright at all and would only really work in a very small pool or fountain."
3,"Good works of Satie and Oliver, but....","I enjoyed this album as far as the QUARTET of Olivier and the works of Satie. Not sure how/why the caliber of Curiale's music is included on this CD. Not in the same league as the aforementioned composers, but the album is worth the listen for just Quartet For The End Of Time if nothing else."
2,Bibleman Live!,"My now nine year old son was a HUGE Bibleman back in the day. He would talk to the lady who owned the local Christian book store and beg her to order the movies for him. I think he has watched every episode multiple times! That being said, I was excited to watch this episode with him. This is a recording of a Bibleman Live event. I am guessing it was at a church. My nine year old didn't really like this show, he said it was kind of boring. And the technology used to make this film is somewhat outdated.My five year old twins who watched this with us were a little more excited about the show, but will probably not ask to watch it again!"
2,Bibleman Review,"Bibleman Video ReviewI received this DVD as part of the BookSneeze program through Thomas Nelson Publishers. I was given this DVD to review in exchange for my honest opinion.Bibleman Video: Combating The Commandant of ConfusionI like Bibleman, but this DVD was not up to the good quality of other Bibleman DVDs. This one was live. Maybe that is the reason for the lower quality.I let my two girls watching the DVD. They said it was ""pretty good, but not great."" Don't let this keep you from the Bibleman series."
2,Just didn't care for this one.,"I was very excited for the opportunity to review this Bible Man DVD as I had heard wonderful things about this series of DVD's. I was however, a bit disappointed. While the DVD contains a wonderful message it is very poorly put together in my opionion. In fact, it felt as if we were watching a home video rather than an actual production that cost money to make and as a result, it seemed to sadly to take away from the wonderful message that was being presented. If you too have heard wonderful things about the Bible Man DVD's and are interested in them for your children, then I would suggest checking out some of the older ones as it is my understanding that they are different than this newer release.*Thank you to Thomas Nelson/Booksneeze for the opportunity to review this DVD. We were sent this DVD for free in exchange for our honest review."
3,C+,This is a decent bandanna/face mask. It does the job and looks good doing it. My only complaint is that its got Velcro to connect the back together and stick to your face. It took me a good while to find a comfortable position to wear this but I got it to work for me. I use it snowboarding all the time and it keeps you just warm enough and still easy to breath out of.
2,Unlistenable sound,"Yes, fine, I'm an audiophile as well as a music lover. The performance if fine but the sound is deplorable. The sound is much too ""close up"", by which I mean it sounds like your ear is about 6"" for each instrument.I have the hybrid SACD version of the recording but the sound is awful regardless of whether the SACD or CD layer is played."
5,More than it appears online.,"My son loved them & there were more of them than expected & a variety of sizes, Great value for the price."
1,"great seller, terrible product","I should have known better, by the low price, that I wouldn't like the lipstick brush.But I had great contact with the seller who refunded me after I described the problem. So, in spite of disliking the product,I recommend using this seller."
2,I don't get it!,Being a lover of the classics I decided that I must read at least one Virginia Woolf book. Perhaps I picked the wrong book. I was bored. I do not understand why it is a classic. I will not be reading any other VW books.
3,necessary,I read this book for it is a required text. Not a difficult reader but superficial. Gives some history lesson
1,WORST BOOK EVER WRITTEN,"The only good thing to say about this ""literary"" drivel is that the person responsible, Virginia Wolf, has been dead for quite some time now. Let us pray to God she stays that way as we, the people, all work together to make sure that no future generations ever have to read this nonsense again. Lets burn every sentence she ever penned to end all the unneccesary suffering that curious readers have to go through when they first pick up ""Mrs. Dalloway."" Aside from being dreadfully boring, might I add that it is also terribly written? Thats right, you heard me. The narrative reads like the inner thoughts of a sugar crazed autistic kid with ADD in the middle of a carnival. Stream of conscience you say? Groundbreaking prose? Get off your high horse you pathetic first year English students and admit, THIS BOOK IS WORSE THAN AIDS! You should not feel compelled to like it just because your professor tells you how brilliant it is."
4,"Good looking edition, useful notes",A good-looking edition with notes that will prove most useful to those new to Mrs. D and England in general.
3,A well written novel but I lost interest in it.,"Probably because Ms. Woolf did too much TELLING and not enough SHOWING. Maybe that's why the novel is so thin. For a better representation of 20th century literature, read Hemingway's ""The Sun Also Rises,"" Faulkner's ""The Sound and the Fury,"" and Salinger's ""The Catcher in a Rye."" The reason I bought ""Mrs. Dalloway"" was because I enjoyed Cunningham's ""The Hours."" What a disappointment."
2,A bit of a wade....,"Like many others i am sure, the reason for reading this was the Hours - i haven't seen the movie, don't plan to, but at the time i wanted to know what the fuss was about. And the fuss is about a arather boring stream of consiciousness style ramble about a pretenious, boring upper-class woman living in London and a (mentally) battle scarred man also living in London, with brief crossings of their tangents here and there. There are a few sentences of particularly lyrical writing, but the main impression is ""And the point is?"" The narrative is practically non-existent (not always a hindrance, but it is in this book). The characters are boring, except for the wife of Septimus, the man mentioned above - she is not given the room she is due. If this is classic Woolf, i will have to avoid her work in future - Orlando was bearable, but i could not see the point of this.Stick to The Hours - it is a much better book!"
2,Plotless Procession of Paratactic Prose,"Day in the life in post-War London, told in stream of consciousness narrative centering mainly on the title character, a middle-aged upper-class British matron as she prepares for a party, and also told from the perspectives of her unsuccessful suitor, her bland husband, her daughter and her daughter's tutor, and an unrelated veteran and his long-suffering Italian war-bride.Woolf will occasionally fly into an inspired combination of words that offer an honest glimpse of life and love that is both profound and awe-inspiring. But the absence of any plot structure leaves the reader not particularly caring how the party turns out, or what these generally boring people are thinking about.I feel stupid for admitting this, but my honest reaction to this book was: ""Huh?"""
2,Great book; horrible Kindle edition,"I would give the book 4 or 5 stars, but this Kindle edition barely rates 2. The formatting is awful, and the publisher didn't even bother to remove hyphens. It's cheap, but even so, this edition is not worth the money."
1,difficult to read,"Woolf's stream of consciousness writing is difficult to read. But the Kindle version made it even worse, since it was carelessly done and included large empty gaps and hyphenated words in the middle of sentences. I found it nearly impossible to read this for my book club."
2,Not a classic,Mrs. Dalloway doesn't make sense. It's not written in sequential order and her characters are all over the place. I found this book extremely boring and pointless. Why is this considered a classic? I gave up 3x but decided to finish. I don't think I will read another Virigina Woolf again.
1,a meandering and pointless novel,"I just finished this book, and I'm still not quite sure what it is I've read. Filled with run-on sentences and paced slower than a tortoise, this book is truly a chore to read. There is no point to this novel; it is simply an account of a day in the life of an airheaded wench and those who have been unfortunate enough to know her. There is no closure at the end, for there is no plot for which closure is needed. The characters are varied, but I really never became interested in any of them. However, on a more positive note, this book will suffice as kindling should the need arise."
3,Symbolic to her own life- Virginia Woolf,"In Mrs. Dalloway, Virgina uses a literary device to help the reader better understand Mrs. Dalloway's inner most thoughts, this tool is called stream of consciousness. This was a literary tool that was trademarked and used effectively by Virginia Woolf. Through this tool, the reader can draw many correlations between Virginia's life and Mrs. Dalloway. Mrs. Dallowway's marriage was one of respect rather than passion. Virginia's marriage to Leonard was a platonic relationship with no passionate love involved. This book also deals with sucide and it views it as a freedom from the strains of life. This is symbolic later in Virginia's life becuse she later committed sucide. Sucide in her mind was unleasing her from the mental breakdowns and the manic depression she faced in her life daily. Overall all this is a good book and it is intersting to draw the similarities between Virginia and Mrs. Dalloway."
5,Very enjoyable,A very enjoyable book - I visited the Woolf's original Hogarth Press printing press in England and it was amazing to stand next to it and actually touch it. I am a big Virginia Woolf fan!
2,Frustrating,"Difficult, detailed, descriptive, dense -- an apt description of Virginia Woolf's prose. I've never been so annoyed by the difficulty and pointlessness of a story in my life. I thought Faulkner was difficult to read. At least his stories go somewhere, never mind that figuring out his plotlines is like putting together the pieces of a broken bottle. Even after I looked up the Cliff's Notes to see what it was that I hadn't picked up from this story, once I'd learned all I could learn, I still just didn't care."
2,Hard to Find Ingredients,"Given all the five star reviews on here, I must be missing something but I just wasn't impressed with this cookbook. It's certainly well organized, the recipes seem authentic and the extensive cultural/historical notes may be of interest to some readers. I was very turned off, however, by the lack of pictures and the extensive use of uncommon or hard-to-find ingredients.I know my area isn't known for it's multiculturalism and maybe these things are easier to find in more metropolitan areas, but it was a real turn-off to not be able to make a bunch of these recipes without special-order items. The lack of pictures seemed particularly odd, given that most of these aren't recipes the average cook is likely to be familiar with; one would think that pictures would be especially helpful and appropriate in such a case."
5,'Well Rounded' truly is!,"Catherine Lipincott's 'Well Rounded' addresses all the issues a woman of size can face---from the factors that motivate her to eat in the first place, to the resulting heartache of failing to meet our society's current 'thin-is-in' standards.Lipincott's thoughtful self-evaluation exercizes, sprinkled throughout the book, gently help the reader reveal levels of herself that may have lain dormant for a lifetime. The outcome of these individual assessments is directly used to help enhance her self-image as well as the she image presents to the world.The book's fashion advice is not 'one-size-fits-all'. The reader can learn to identify her best features and customize her appearance to highlight them, no matter what they are or what her size.'Well Rounded' is a quick read, but with deep thought and an obvious sense of caring and outreach behind it. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is or loves a larger woman."
5,Wonderful!,"This comforting, easy to read book encourages you to *accept* yourself, love yourself and feel good. Catherine is like a friend, guiding you along the path and encouraging you all the way. I personally loved the meditations on body acceptance. I've read this time and time again."
2,Too Basic,"Not a bad book, but too basic for anyone but a real beginner in telephone selling. Contains a few pieces of good information, but not worth spending money on this book for the small return on investment. Get it from the library if you must read it. Spend money on books for your library that you'll refer to again and again such as Successful Cold Calling by Lee Boran, High Probability Selling by Jacques Werth, and I'd Rather Have a Root Canal Than Do Cold Calling by Shawn Greene."
2,An Overly Simple Overview of Phone Sales,"Bly does an adequate job explaining the numbers and goal systems required to determine one's required performance input as well as thoughts on customer retention. However, this book has a glaring weakness in its absence of true psychological analysis. One need not have a long history of sales to understand that a single strategy for handling objections will leave you at the bottom of the field. Since people react very differently to diverse stimuli, it is imperative you master prospect cues and consistent interrelated response techniques if you are anticipating any sales success; something this book gives far too little attention to.As an overview of phone sales, this book succeeds only in that it will assist readers establishing their goals, system, and client preservation; however this book does not contain any major ""secrets"" or any of the psychological principles that most quality sales books typically include."
4,"easy to use, convenient","Advertisements for Nordic Walking poles claim up to 40% increase in calories burned. I don't think I've seen that level of increase - but then again, if I had it would probably make my walk far more exhausting and less fun. I find the poles add a nice arm workout to my exercise. The poles are very light. The technique is very easy to pick up.It is easy to adjust the height of these poles. Most reviews say that you should not get telescoping poles, but rather get ones sized for your height. The benefit of these poles is that they are in three segments, rather than 2, so they collapse small enough for travel. They could easily be thrown in a carry-on bag or kept in a larger desk drawer at work."
5,Great program,"I use this when I am riding in the car, and I am picking conversational Japanese at a steady pace. I am not working real hard at it, but am getting results."
1,Defective Pimsleur Conversational Japanese CDs,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT-IT IS DEFECTIVE. It is a set of 8 CDs, each of which contains two language lessons. Lesson 14 on CD 7 of the set was defective; specifically, the last 2-3 minutes of the lesson would not play properly (it skipped, popped, and was generally unintelligible). Per Amazon's recommendation, I first called Pimsleur directly and spoke with a customer service rep, who would not replace the CD without charging me a $20 shipping fee--not acceptable, since the CD was defective. I then called Amazon and spoke with a customer service rep, who sent me a replacement set free of charge, but lesson 14 on CD 7 of the second set was also defective. Since this appears to be a problem with an entire run of this product, I do not recommend buying it."
2,"Poor plot, poor acting, poor FX","Venus Rising is a thriller set in the near future, where an island prison has been abandoned by the authorities and the inmates left to starve. Years later, three inmates make an escape from the island and find themselves on Pacifica, an island paradise where bored rich people find stimulation in virtual reality. Murder and identity switching ensue, as the authorities hunt for the escapees.This movie basically steals plot elements from Wild Palms and Strange Days and does a worse job than either of those two movies. For a start, the acting is weak, with a bunch of third tier talent like Billy Wirth and Costas Mandylor. Morgan Fairchild serves no purpose in this movie. The only actor with some salt was Audie England, whose only other roles seem to be in Zalman King type erotica.This movie also obviously had a lousy budget. Even the scenes where they are meant to be entering virtual reality are hokey."
5,You can't go wrong with Jessica Alba,To some this movie will not appeal. Some might even go as far to say that it is completely beyond redemption because of its views of the future and its terrible plot line. But I say its got one huge redeming quality and that is Jessica Alba.
5,Common Sense for the Common Man,"My daughter sent me this book and once I started, I couldn't put it down. Like many, we all expericence encounters like the author describes and wonder, what was the business owner thinking. Mr. Coates sure makes you think. I have a masters degree in management and work for a huge Fortune 500 company. If my firm would employ the insights the author shares, we would not have to worry about business, The book is very easy to read, enjoyable and entertaining, and full of valuable snippets of plain common sense. Everyone who runs a business or deals with customers of any sort, should read it. Highly recommended."
5,New Zealand Melodic Perfection,"I first heard the bats ona little known surfmovie (or rather bodyboaring movie) called Blastoff. It had Black and Blue on it, whch is an amazing song and worth buying the entire album for, however the Blastoff tape also had ""flotsam"" on it, Flotsam is an amazing song as well. There is a beautiful harmony between the lead singers voice and a female background vocal. Give it a listen"
4,Interesting and pretty good,"I really like the 50's and 60's CD. I'm not as fond of the 70's CD. I would have thought that the 70's could have been represented better -- I'm not sure by what. Maybe it was just a lame decade for instrumentals. The quality is good, though and I'm happy with them (even the 70's one)."
2,Not bad.I guess,I can't really remember how I liked it or not since you have sent this review 5 months after I bought it.
3,Pretty good,"Some of the entries are sharply written histories. Others are overwhelmingly flinty, reading more like timely newspaper editorials of the day. Although some of the first-person accounts are dazzling acts of observation, many of the essays are polemic and tedious. There is little of the sweet aroma of context in this volume, but for purists already familiar with much of the ground covered, ""The Aspirin Age"" is probably an invaluable companion history to the years between the wars."
5,The true nuts and bolts of an acting career.,"This is hands down THE best book on acting, or should I say business, that I have ever read! Forget all that [...] that your college professors and other so-called ""experts"", or ""Professionals"" have told you about being an actor. This book at fist seems so radical in its philosophy, yet upon reflection, so practical. What becomes apparent is that the ideas in this book are basically common sense! Monroe Mann has written a book that is so simple, direct, inspiring and empowering that one realizes that they have done themself a disservice by giving credence to all the conventional ""wisdom"" and the nay-sayers. I wish I had this book 10 years ago when I was just getting started! Once you read it yourself, you'll never feel at the mercy of the big fish again! Now what are you waiting for? Go get a copy, read it, and kick some butt!"
3,Fair.,"There is an appropriate number of toothbrushes for the price and they are effective. For this I give them 2 stars. Yet, the brush (bristles) are very small. The bristles don't hold up well, so you have to change the toothbrush more often then the 3 months, even when only brushing 3x/day. It is great that you have a pack of 6 because you will need to change them more often than other toothbrushes. The Indicator bristles are supposed to change to a lighter color when time to change, which is usually around 2 months with these toothbrushes. It's a good purchase if you want to have extra toothbrushes for visitors, but not for everyday use. Hope this review helps you.God bless!"
5,Beautiful!,Lovely flawless pearl. High luster with a rose tinge. Checked out a similar sized pendant at Macy's. The price was higher and the quality was not as good.
1,Not as pictured,Very dissapointing. The picture shows cloths with rounds corners like most washcloths have HOWEVER the cloths that arrived seem very cheaply made and squared corners looking more like small towels. I could never put these out as wash cloths.
1,What Kona,"This coffee blend is not worth the money.10% Kona, but 90% Columbian, not what I want inKona coffee."
3,Too weak,This is the only Senseo product I have found that makes an almost strong enough mug of coffee. All others require 2 pods for a 12 oz. mug and that gets rather pricy and wasteful.
2,artificial taste,"Not as good quality as the regular flavors of Senseo coffees and we have had our machines for over 6 years... Medium and Dark Roast, Kona and Breakfast blend are by far the best. Sumatra is good also if you like dark rich coffee...Love the ease of the pod system but will probably go to the K-Cups! Just not available enough anymore."
5,Fantastic Coffee,"We have two coffee pots in our house the Senseo & a regular coffee pot. We are lucky enough to be able to purchase regular Kona coffee for the regular coffee pot, so I was very happy when I found the Kona Blend. Granted it is a blend, but it is very smooth & tastes great."
3,These were good before I succumbed to King K-Cup,"The Senseo made sense, and had no plastic cup waste to-boot. The taste was nice but the pods became hard to find and varieties waned instead of grew. The machine itself started to fail, needing to be descaled too often. It became time to switch to the winning team and I bought a Keurig a few years ago and never looked back. Too bad, Senseo could've been great."
4,Smooth,"When I searched the net for pods there were lots of warnings that the senseo brand wasn't so good. Granted I am not an avid coffee drinker,however I really look forward to a good morning cup of coffee that won't burn a hole in my stomach. I usually run one senseo pod through twice and have a perfect cup. If anything - needs a little more of the flavor (i.e. hazlenut, vanilla) added to it. But still very good."
4,A Good blend for morning,"I previously had purchased this as part of a pack with 4 flavors. I enjoy this one and the Kona blend the most. Though the Kona blend is my favorite, this is a good runner-up. It's a solid blend, not too strong, not too weak. It doesn't really have any subtle nuances or anything, but it is a good starter coffee for your day."
3,A religious tome,"I wish someone would have warned me before I read this book that it is essentially religious propoganda. It was worth reading though, because it's a nice historical novel (apart from the fact that it's historically inaccurate - eg, I read in a very reliable source that it is quite unlikely that Nero caused Rome to be burnt) in that it gives you some idea of what it must have been like to live in Nero's time, and introduces you to the major figures of Nero's time in a way that you'll remember for a long time. But other than that it's sort of a Bible story, not in my line at all. So be forewarned.Michael Chesser Aiken, SC"
1,Five stars for THIS book? Please tell me you're joking!,"I'm 19 and I've tried reading this book for about hundred times. At least. But everytime I start reading it, I get bored out of my mind! I can never go beyond the page 11. Don't get me wrong now. I DO read books quite a lot. (At least one a month) and I don't mind if a book is hard to understand, I like thinking about the message and everything. But this one is just killing me. I started trying to read it when I was 14, but I just can't make it. This normally wouldn't be a problem for me at all - I'd just stop trying to read it,... but the thing is I WANT to read it because it's a classic and it's one of the world's greatest books. And everyone who has read it says it's the best. So people, ... if you're reading this, help me out. What should I do?"
2,Really great movie but had issues,"I love this movie and was ecstatic to get it at such a low price. But when I tried to watch it, it wouldn't play in my dvd player or on my computer. The only way I could watch it was on my family's old xbox.. Really weird. I would rather pay a few more dollars for a compatible DVD. It is extremely annoying that I can't watch a DVD on a DVD player.. But not worth the shipping to get a refund."
5,One of my favorites!,"I don't really have a review for the dvd itself, it's a review of the movie. Robert Redford is hilarious and it's one that everyone should have. Talk about a picture of new marriage!"
2,I wish I had my money back.,"I bought this perfume blindly based on reviews I read on perfume sites on the Net. And yes, buying perfume blindly is silly; but if buying over the Internet is the most convenient means to getting certain products because those products are not readily available to you because you live in a small town, then sometimes you have to make that gamble.This is a poor excuse for a citrus scent. It is sharp and simply not good smelling. It smells bad in the bottle, on paper, and on the skin. I expected better from a reputable company like Burberry. Maybe I'll have better luck with a Bvlgari fragrance."
1,Missing parts,"This item appears to need a pool vacuum to go with it. There were no instructions included with the package, and I was unable to find where to purchase a vacuum that would work with this product."
5,bringing home my frozen food,"The purchase was easy - the delivery fast. I only wish I'd read the specs more closely - I needed something more square than a '12-pack' [I don't drink sodas or beer]. But if that's what yr after, it's GREAT!"
3,COLD but SMALL,"This keeps the few things that you can fit inside of it COLD...for hours and hours. for that it's great... but there is no way to get 12 cans in here... maybe 6. It works, it's just not big enough."
5,Dr. Order #2,This product was prescribed for me by my dr. specifically from this company. I feel is has helped my blood pressure as a natural herb for and decreases the other meds I would take.
3,On the fence....,"I wasn't as impressed with this cd as in Steamshipkillers. It sounded a bit experimental to me whereas Steamshipkillers sounded more mature and put together( and looks like was released in 2010). This cd was realeased in 2006. Was this their first album? Not sure but I'll have to give it a listen a few more times. I'd pick up the other cd before I picked up this one if you want to give them a listen. If you're into Steampunk, you'll probably like it.~"
2,Seam came out after less than 2 months use,"At first my husband loved this wallet--it fixed the giant bulging wallet problem for sure. However, after less than a couple of months of use (just past the return window time frame) the seam going between the two card slots on one side came undone. This makes the one side of the wallet virtually useless. The problem is, and you can see this if you look closely at the picture, that the seam only is about 3/4 of an inch long--it doesn't extend the length of the pocket. I'm sure that pulling cards in and out a few times a day would be better supported by a seam that runs the length of the pocket."
2,Who's paying all these positive reviewers?,There is no doubt this a thin wallet since your cards are essentially separated into 4 separate stacks by the compartments. What is also true is that credit cards and anything else you carry EASILY SLIPS OUT.If you don't fold the wallet completely open and squeeze the contents you are bound to have the experience of having all or most of what's in your wallet fall out when using it.This wallet is worth about $1.00.
1,The Wallet is a lie,"First off, cards don't actually fit in the pocket. I had to force a single card into the pocket. That caused the seams to tear. This was a regular old debit mastercard, nothing like an Amex Black. US dollars only barely fit into the cash pocket. Forget about any currency even 2mm wider. This is supposed to be a European model. It's a joke. If you really want to spend $15 and not get anything for it, just send it to me. I'll be happy to give you a worthless folded piece of paper in exchange."
4,"Good, but not for everybody","I've had mine for about 2 years now and it's holding up well, some minor stitching coming loose. There is a slight learning curve to using it because as others have said, the cards are not always held in too tightly, but you just learn how to open it. For me, it's great, because I sit in a hood all day and my old wallet was tough on my back.My sister got one for her husband and his two brothers. Out of the 3, her husband hated it, but the two brothers loved it. So, it's not for everyone. I'll probably buy another one soon, and lean towards getting the smaller one with only two pockets because I don't carry a lot of cards.Only 4 stars because not everyone will like it."
2,Thin but loud,"This wallet is thin, but the material feels like thin plastic, and makes a loud crinkle sound whenever it's used in any way.. much like the sound you might get crinkling up newspaper for the fireplace. It's actually kind of humerous when you pull it out and open it in a store : )"
4,The better understanding of history,"This book provides you with a better understanding of human history. How we western people lost connection to the culture and religion of our forefathers, how the world became disunited due to later cultures and religions, how this later cultures and religions took over or demonized the teachings, holy places and temples of the original culture and religion. If we want the world to become a better place, we have to look at it when it was a better place: 5000 years ago, when the culture of our forefathers united the whole world. We have to revive this original culture of us all - at least in our minds and hearts."
4,Stryder's Study Guide,The multiple choice is very helpful in studying for the exam. The book outlines in depth questions on specific reactions. This is great for piecing everything together.
1,You call this spiritual rites?,I don't recommend this book if you are a serious spiritual seeker. It was a full disappointment for me. I wanted to know about serious spiritual initiations and aids to help my teen. This is just intellectual crap.
3,Lightly hard and heavy,"Those shoes aren't design for Cross-Training they are hard and heavy, thus not very confortable for sport"
5,Awesomely High Praise,"I once was lost... Thanks to EF's writings, now found. If you aren't into or can't stomach the old 'blind faith' stuff but have a yearning for connection to the Christ, this is a great place to start! Only better book I have ever read is EF's The Sermon on the Mount."
5,"Wonder........ful, story a Keeper","I just loved Brian, and Alex. She's black and a novelist,he's white and a singer. They meet and instant attraction.Brain chases Alex, but then a life threating accidenthappens and they have to over come that. A differentending than I am use to but I just love this book and Ijust know you will too."
5,Author's reply,"I was dissapointed to read Sally Ann's comments on '365 Steps to Self-Confidence', especially since it has been well received and sold well around the world. I wonder what she expected of this type of book. I note that most of the favourable reviews she has posted are for fiction - confidence building is a serious issue, unlikely to be as entertaining! I also wondered whether she believes it is possible to build confidence as quickly as one can read a novel - it takes application and - yes - time and patience! The steps in my book are effective if applied, and anyone who thinks that a year is too long in the context of a lifetime is probably not struggling with lack of confidence to begin with. OK, Sally Ann - this book is not for you, but it has helped a lot of people.BlessingsDavid L. Preston, Bournemouth, England, 7th July 2006"
3,Great!,"I think that the animini dvd is a good idea.It got me to like full metal panic. I only bought it because of the price. I paid three dollars. But, the dvd won't go into some dvd players.I may buy more dvds. though, I don't think that i'm going to buy more full metal panic. (because the dvds are thirty dollars)I have other series that I want more. (and because I have a friend who has the whole series)"
2,why this title?,"The series got boring even before this book! It's always the same plots just in different times!And if you care for details in a series, to follow the whole history of the caracters, don't buy any of Griffin's books, because he is mixing everything: names, ranks, places, dates,...! It can drive you crazy. Doesn't he ever control what he writes?What made me really angry at this special book, is that there is no reference to the title, concerning the main caracters!"
4,Good,"The more I listen to this album the more I love it. ""Liberian Girl"" must be one of the most under appreciated songs of the century. There's so much emotion on it. He wrote it in 1983 but it didn't appear until this album.Most of these songs are up tempo. The best are Smooth Criminal, Just Good Friends, and Another Part of Me."
5,The King of Pop at his best,"This is my favourate album of all time, I love this album so much. There are no weak songs, so it's no wonder Michael got 7 number 1 songs from this album. Most songs are upbeat, but there are Speed Demon and Dirty Diana (My favorite song) which are rock/pop songs. Man In The Mirror and I Can't Stop Loving You are sweet soft ballads. Just Good Friend got the best 2 vocalests in history, a duet Michael with Stevie Wonder. and I must say they're great together. I recomend this album to fans and nonfans of Michael Jackson."
5,HE WILL ALWAYS BE THE BEST,"ONCE YOU START THIS DVD, YOU HAVE TO FINISH IT ALL, THEN YOU WILL SEE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN... THE MEN WAS INCREDIBLE."
3,Good Album,"Three-and-a-half stars. Combining the blitzkrieg guitar sound of the Ramones with the girl-group harmonies of the Go-Go's, Nikki and the Corvettes have a tuneful pop-punk sound, which for their time (late '70's, early '80's) was pretty original. Strong songs include ""He's a Mover,"" ""You're the One,"" ""Criminal Element,"" and, especially, ""Gimme Gimme."" It's punk bubblegum, not even slightly cynical or ironic, and a lot of fun. At the same time, I give it only three-and-a-half stars because, while most of the songs have melodies that are pretty good, only a few stick in your head after the song's over in the way that the best bubblegum should - something indefinable is missing from the rest. Their sound, which doesn't vary from song to song, can get annoying over the course of an album. And the liner notes, while containing interesting pictures ;) and articles, tell you little about the band. Still, I'm glad I bought it, it's worth owning, and I recommend it."
3,'Right In The Nuts' - V/A - Aerosmith Tribute (Small Stone),"It seems that it USED to be that usually a band tribute album didn't surface until the group was no longer OR until the artist(if it's a solo act)has passed on.I guess what I'm trying to say is that there are to many tribute CD's floating around out there.'Right In The Nuts' is okay,with the two-disc release having a total running time of a hair over two hours.Some of the tunes that I thought stood out were Alabama Thunderpussy,doing ""Sweet Emotion"",Atomic Bitchwax with ""Combination"",Iron Boss,giving us ""Train Kept A Rollin'"",Novadriver covering ""Seasons Of Wither"" and Roadsaw with their take on ""Toys in The Attic"".Not a bad find."
2,It Could Have Been Better.,"There`s A Few Songs In This Album, The Lower My Ranking. Why Mix Country With Screeming Rock`n Roll Tunes ????"
4,Rimes is Best at pop,"Short and sweet, LeAnn Rimes is best singing pop songs. And she has a passable voice singing rock (a couple songs on the album). She has a trained voice whose placement varies too little to ever sound like the country hick singing a heartfelt country lyric, so she's best singing Celine Dion-style Big Voice ballads, and there are a couple great ones on this album.Though the album may not appeal to the hard-core country enthusiast, I think it's her best album since ""Twisted Angel"" (which I think IS her best), and better than her next album, ""Family"".Don't return to pure country, LeAnn. Pop really needs a ""real"" diva."
5,Excellent introduction to Switching and Networks,"An excellent introduction to Switching and Network Managementin general.Up-to-date (1998) and relevant, I would recommend this to anyone starting out in Switching technologies. 'SWITCH EVERYWHERE'!"
2,Just did not like,"Does not like the way the instructor teach, plus the third workout is the same as the first two, I thought it would be something different."
1,The ramblings of a dim-witted narcissist.,The consistant vague emptiness of Gooch's writings show that this unsuccessful model/writer manque' must have slept with someone relatively powerful in the publishing world. This book sings hymns to the lazy mediocrity to which so many aspire.
4,Lars and the Real Girl,"This is a good movie. I feel sympathetic to people who don't fit in very well or have a mental illness. These people still have the same human emotions and needs as everyone and it is sometimes hard for them to cope. I am single and an introvert, so I can understand a little about how this guy feels. The movie has some funny moments because the story is so bizarre, but there are also some sad moments."
5,a gem,"this is a gem, not that well known but critically well received, some said the best picture of the year; Ryan Gosling is just right, a delicate portrait which becomes completely believeable; funny, touching, heart warming"
4,"Interesting, unusal story line",Loved the story. A unique portrayal of a flawed but lovable person. Extra words required...so I really liked the movie. There I made the word count. sheesh.
5,A very apt and appropriate title for these gems,"Barbara Bonney's voice and interpretive skills truly showcase these songs of Grieg, Sibelius, and the others. Her tone is clear, radiant and she exhibits warmth and stylistic versatility. The interpretation is really the main thing here. She communicates the subtleties of the poetry in these songs.Grieg is, of course, the best known, on an international scale, for his songs, and some of these are indeed familiar.Sibelius wrote over a 100 songs, but his reputation for symphonic works has overshadowed these songs...they are well worth our acquaintance.The other composers are unfamiliar to those outside the Nordic countries and again we are rewarded by becoming acquainted with them.This is a beautiful, exquisitely delivered compilation which is sure to please those who love the art song."
2,Not for the Home Baker...,"I had this book on my wishlist for almost a year and received it for Christmas. I sat down on Christmas evening and eagerly paged through the book. What a disappointment. Most of the recipes did absolutely nothing for me. Most of the recipes were time consuming and tedious. Yes, it's nice to look at, but I want to taste, not look, and this book totally put me off to trying many of the recipes. I was very disappointed. If you want truly decadent chocolate desserts, I highly recommend Chocolate Desserts by Pierre Herme. These recipes were specifically written for the home kitchen and are truly inspiring and decadent. It doesn't get any better than Chocolate Desserts. Don't waste your time/money on this book unless you want showpieces rather than decadent desserts."
3,Not the Quality I Expected,"These sheets are rather disappointing: they are long enough for a twin extra-long but they are fairly stiff and the pattern is clearly one-sided, leaving the non-printed side almost white. While the weight and fit of the sheets says quality, their appearance and stiffness does not. I expected better from a brand like Tommy Hilfiger."
4,A Vibrant Universe is Alive & Well!,"Finally, a book on gemstones and healing that goes beyond mere descriptions and remedies. This book has the most vivid and clear photography I've ever seen on crystals. In addition to that, Dr. Shelley Kaehr does a remarkable job in sharing with the reader her ""experience"" of working with these gems of Mother Gaia. This is not another clinical treatise on the subject, Dr. Kaehr strikes gold again with another excellent adventure!"
5,Ribena Fans!,"Our family loves Ribena, a British favorite. Ribena is a delicious black currant concentrate. Add water and enjoy it hot or cold. So glad to have found it on Amazon as up until now it's been very difficult to get in the USA."
5,"""Wassail"" plucks the hearstrings; simply masterful!","There must have been something of a plan in the meeting of Lynn Barnes and Allison Hampton. Twenty years since their musical rendezvous, their musicworks sparkle ever brighter on the intimate stage or in the home. Gentle songs find eager voices through the magical assortment of ancient instruments selected for ""Wassail."" Allison Hampton's incomparable Celtic harp and Linn Barnes' magical lutes, guitars and pipes are richly complemented by flutes, recorders, percussion instruments and the occasional cello. Hauntingly majestic and exotic Uillean pipes of ""King Herod and the Clock"" sing to us of wassail and Yuletide, of distance and olden times and of hearth. The frequent dance tempos wash the album with exuberant gaiety. So settle back and listen to this album with someone you love, and a wassail to you!"
5,Glad to have this movie in DVD!,My husband and I have always loved this movie and I am glad to have it in DVD! The special effects are great!
3,"Fearless Vampire Killers, or pardon me but your teeth are in","This is one of those campy films that you just have to love. The plot is thin, but the laughs are big. It most certainly is not meant to be anything except mindless entertainment. My 15 year old daughter tells me that the music is very wierd, and that the sound is to low to actually hear what they are saying. She seemed to like turning on the sub-titles. All of her friends also said that it is to weird, but it still goes to all of the teen parties with her.Overall, it is a funny film that has no redeaming social value.I really liked the movie when it first came out, but over time I think that it has not held up all that well.Give it a look if you like. Easily worth 10 bucks for the DVD, but no more than that.Jonathan"
3,The fearless vampire Killers,The dvd was ok. But nothing to write home about. I got it for my wife. She wanted to see a movie with Sharon Tate in it.
1,"""Fangs"" for Nothing","Caveat emptor. The tip-off that you get what you pay for is when the director has a starring role. I fear that this is Roman Polanski's finest work and he, his Fearless Vampire Killers, and its subject matter share one thing in common -- they all suck.This film is so bad it's not even cliched, yet those who have a taste for heavily endowed women in Edwardian attire will not wag their tongues as I do. Twelve year old boys...pull up a chair. The Fearless Vampire Killers is potentially the crudest film one might stumble into. In fact, it may actually require the inability to walk erect to be amused by it."
3,love this kind of movie,"I purchased this movie because I,ve seen it before. Love those old campy B Movies."
2,Mehhh....,"I purchased this book with high hopes, but was let down. The first half of the book was pretty engaging, but the second half was full of random chapters that didn't seem to connect very well. The last chapter was a complete waste of time - sounded more like a high school drama story in a car.All in all, I'd continue looking for a different book that may actually teach you something a bit more substantial."
3,A Half Full Demi-Tasse,"I received this book as a gift and was hoping for a more informative book about coffee, its history, and its intricacies. Instead, I found a collection of miscellaneous chapters that were, at best, loosely connected. The anecdotes provoked laughter, but I don't think I would call it hilarious. ""The Devil's Cup"" is a light read and worthwhile so long as you don't open the book hoping for an academic read."
2,Riddled with errors.,"I found many errors in this book, especially in chapter 8, ""The Calculating Trader"", as well as some in other chapters. Unfortunately, if you don't catch these errors, this book will only confuse you more. If you do catch them, it will just annoy you. Granted, I have the first edition of this book (2005); hopefully these errors have been corrected in the new June 2008 second edition. I gave the book 2 stars because it does have some decent overview information in it."
3,Good,Juan Luis Guerra is one of my favorite singers. I sent for this CD because it contains a great deal of his greatest hits. I only have one regreat: the last song seems to have a damage or something: it can't be played properly. I kept it because the rest is in good condition.
4,Much better when read as an adult...,"I remember being force fed this as a h.s. student, and it went soaring overhead, for the most part. I really enjoyed this much more when I needed to read it to tutor a student now. The story of adultery, trying to recapture the past, remaking your past to suit your desires, all of that - resonates much more when read in my middle to late middle years. Give it another try!"
3,Nice Starter,"This is a good starter. The mag life if pretty good, and the accuracy is the best with .20 bb's. the .12 will work just fine in these, but they aren't that accurate at a distance. after a while of playing with this, the cocking bolt bends, but mine hasn't broken off yet. The thing still works, it's just bent. The rail on the top is made for .22 scope or red dot sight. I put my old .22 scope on it, and i love it. the thing is ok in durability. the tip can come of with some abuse, but if your careful, it wont. I let some guy borrow mine when we were playing, and he dropped it, and the front sight broke off. i glued it back together, but it isn't nearly as strong as when i first got it. all in all, this is a good starter."
5,Excellent Spark novel,"I highly recommend Memento Mori. First of all, the elderly -- and we are talking about the advanced in age, sixty-eight year olds are consider the ""young"" -- rarely receive fictional treatment. As a thirtysomething reader, I found Spark's take on the topic interesting and the ending (as well as the mystery of the phone calls) oh so effective.Spark takes pains to show how the wisdom that is supposed to accrete over the years has not worked and her characters display the same vices and virtues that they have their whole lives. The ending is sudden and heartbreaking because the absence of direction the characters show never abates.Another strong effort by one of Britain's literary doyennes."
2,Rush job?,"This novel is the epitome of ""so-so"". It's ok. I've read it once and I'm ready to pass it on. Plot development is thin. Character development is thin. This is the equivalent of a writing assgignment being written the night before. Only rap songs have more grammatical errors than this book. I can't sell mine as new because punctuation and grammar errors are marked with yellow highlighter on practically every page!Romantica (not a spelling error) scenes are unfounded. For all their emoting, the main characters barely know each other and what they find out about each other mostly comes from alternative sources and not each other. But at the end of the day, one doesn't really buy a book like this for its literary pretentions. For the money, there are much better books than this one."
2,Not what you think,"This book is a strange work of graphic comic fiction. It is aimed at a mature audience, I hope. I would place it in the genre of Adult Swim if it were on Cartoon Network. I first read this book as a young child. It was strange and dark and weird. It may have helped develop my sense of adult humor."
4,"Dibs has ""unlocked"" the door to a happy life","In the novel, Dibs: In Search of Self, I found many instances of the word ""lock."" Through this stirring novel, Dibs is able to ""unlock"" his emotions and allow himself to be happy. He realizes that he can be angry, sad or happy and that is what makes him Dibs. This was a touching novel, I can understand how some readers may believe that it is cruel to motherhood, but from my viewpoint, Dibs mother did not smother him with love, as so many mothers do. She passed him off as a ""chunk of a thing"" and believed that with her intellect, she could not have a mentally retarded child. But as we see, Dibs has an IQ of 168. But that's not what is important in a child, or any being, it is the self-worth that Dibs found through his play therapy sessions. He ""unlocked"" the door and found himself. This was a remarkable novel, and I recommend this book to those who would like to see the strength in a child named Dibs."
2,This one is very much like otha's...,"Reading this one was a challenge---the author's intent is well-received, but she missed it on this one. The story was missing much of what makes a novel in the Christian fiction genre--depth, reality, and inspiration. I felt like I was reading a book written for very young girls, for which Ms. Moore typically writes. Aside from that, the author's attempt to write a great love story took a sad turn toward the romance novel direction and got VERY dramatic.I wish I could say this one was good, but it didn't move my spirit at all. If you want a quick read that will have you scratching your head at the end wondering ""what just happened?"", then this one is for you. For Christian fiction with more depth and integrity, check out ""JOY"" by Victoria Christopher Murray, ""A Change is Gonna Come"" by Jacquelin Thomas, or ""Forgiving Hour"" by Robin Lee Hatcher."
5,Awesome Book!,This book is soo good. I read the book in a day and could not put it down. The characeters are real and so are the consequences of their decisions. It's beautifully written. Also read Flame the book is very good as well. Both are a must read!
5,"Excellent, straightforward and practical","This book is the single most valuable must-read on human knowledge you will ever find. It's clear, well-written and to-the-point. It will make you aware of the tricks even the most educated people can play on themselves and others. It is the single best antidote to the foggy-brained drivel churned out by religionists, philosophers, and postmodernists."
1,song title for the preview,for rosie and mark d. kim.. The title for the song played in the preview is Tonight and the Rest of My Life by Nina Gordon. Hopefully this will help you guys
5,Captain Corelli's Mandolin CD,This is a great CD for background music. Very soothing. It's also a great movie to watch which helps you understand the music.
1,Finally found the Song!,"I too would have purchased the cd, had it not been for your reviews. I was looking for the song used in the reviews, too. I finally found the Artist, though. 'Tonight & The Rest of My Life' by Nina Gordon. Amazon has her cd for sale under ""Tonight & The Rest of My Life (+1 Bonus [IMPORT] Nina Gordon"" Hope this helps. :)"
4,Exactly What I Needed,That worked really well and was surprisingly easy job. Took me and my friend about 2.5hrs to do 20valves on my Audi. Hi quality tool. It could have used some spacers for mounting to partially threaded studs.
4,"Fun, early Roberts","The thing I liked most about this story was the setting - a travelling circus! It is very different, although the rest of the story is trademark Roberts - the characters start off on the wrong foot and spend much of the story fighting the inevitable. The ending is a bit confusing, but the story is still interesting, romantic and (at times) comical and even sad.I borrowed this book, it was a quick read and cute."
4,"Helpful for the experience, but not beginners","I would recommend this book if you have already developed a repretoire for solving olympiad (USAMO, IMO, etc) level problems. This book teaches a couple more interesting startegies to add to your olympiad bag of tricks. However, a beginner to olympiad problems may wish to consider a different book first.I bought this book this year before my first USAMO. I wanted to acquaint myself with important problem solving techniques I would need for this test. Whiel this book provided many important insights and tricks, It was not helpful for my purposes. Basically, it gave plenty of extra tricks, but very, very little on where to apply these tricks and how a student would know to use a given technique.In all, I'd rate this book a 5 for advanced problem solvers who know what they are doing but want a good set of problems and extra techniques. However, a newcomer to olympiads may wish to consider a different book to start educating themselves in problem-solving"
2,Coffee Quality Is Average At Best,"The Hamilton Beach Single cup machine works great, as advertised. Unfortunately, the Senseo Coffee Pods taste like average cheap diner coffee. The coffee tastes stale and old, only gets worse since there are 18 pods in a bag. Everytime the bag is opened and is exposed to air, it makes the next cup taste even more stale.With that said, I love the concept and especially the price of the machine so I will continue to use it and try the re-usable filter with a better coffee."
5,Great cup of coffee.,This coffee is really good! We have been drinking it for our morning pick-me-up for the last 4 years! My Husband says he has never had better.When we have quests and serve this coffee they all agree with him. We have an Amazon subscription to have it delivered monthly to our door so we don't run out. Thanks Amazon for offering this great product
2,No flavor,"The coffee is very weak. I tried 8 & 6 oz of water, and the coffee still tastes like water. I would not recommend the Senseo Dark Roast."
5,Senseo coffee pods,"We love this product, it stays fresh, is ready in minutes and has the same advantages as products madewith more expensive espresso machines."
3,Not strong enough,"I have a basic problem of having been brought up in Spain. So, I'm oriented to good strong robust coffee. In my research, I concluded that this would be the strongest available for Senseo. Still not strong enough. This morning I used 2 pods to make a short cup of coffee. Its getting better. I also just discovered that they make a pod filter in which I can place my own coffee grounds. I will order two of these and test them. I feel this may be the answer."
4,Dark roast is my favorite,I just got the senseo coffee machine and it came with the medium and light coffee. I ordered the dark myself. I much prefer the dark. Its richer and has a fuller body. Its stronger. If you like stronger coffee this is the one for you.I also tried to double up the medium blend. While this was better it still wasnt as good as the dark.
5,Bold - Goes a long way,I can use this dark pods and get a big mug cup out of one pod. Using 2 made it too strong for our family. This allows the coffee to go twice as far. GREAT BUDGET IDEA. Overall I like the combo of the pot and the pods.
4,Best Coffee Ever,"We enjoy the taste, as well as the simplicity and ease, of making a fresh cup of coffee whenever desired."
3,"Best value, decent flavor","With 18 pods, this is the best deal for Senseo pods, but the flavor of the coffee is less bold and flavorful than some of the other flavors. The dark roast is strong - certainly not espresso strong, but drinkable. Mild and medium are too weak to enjoy.The Kenya and Sumatra pods are as strong as the dark roast pods and have a better flavor. Unfortunately they are packaged in 16 instead of 18 per package. These are available at a regional discount grocery store (Marc's Grocery) for $3.33 per pack and can often be found at other grocery stores with a similar sale price."
4,"Nobody framed the A-Team, they are that damn good...","A-Team is FRESH. The beats are very original, and the lyrics can't be faded. This unbelievable team of legendary underground mc's can't be dealt with as they will easily take a mic and rip it from the get-go. ""Who Framed the A-Team?"" is a very good album and even though it hasn't gotten any exposure, maybe it's good because the people who listen to commercial probably wouldn't appreciate ""real hip-hop"" anyway. Maybe they just don't deserve to hear good music."
3,"Sting,you disappointed me","This was an okay ppv.Some of the Lethal Lottery matches were boring.The main event was good,but I had trust in Sting.The Giant is a good athlete,but he can get beat Sting.I would rent it to see do you like it."
5,Wonderful stories about real people!!,"After reading hundreds of lesbian stories about beautiful blondes with bods to match, it was such a refreshing change to read about the real women known as lesbians...the overweight ones, the ones with children, the ones who live in nightmare worlds of drugs and alcohol. These characters were easy to like. . .and hate."
5,Pur Minerals is the top!,"The other mineral wannabes offer loose powder and the mess that comes with that. Pur Minerals is pressed, tidy, easily carried in your purse or luggage and has always been the gold standard."
2,"Not on par with M.R. James, not at all","This is a fairly short book, and was the first of Blackwood's works that I have read. To be honest, not very impressed; having devoured M.R. James' collected Ghost Stories, I was looking for a suitable alternative. Sad to say, Blackwood isn't the one. Read some of Le Fanu, and found that to be a little better, but there's no beating M.R. James."
2,Not worth the price,"The item exterior covering is low quality. It was made in Taiwan back when Taiwan still was ""Made in China"" so this item, while new, feels like it has been sitting in a warehouse for a generation. You can search around Amazon and find a superior product for about $17."
1,Broke during 1st use,"I bought this for a T6 Torx bit. I used it one time. Halfway through using it, it snapped near the head, breaking off in the T6 screw. I was screwing the pocket clip onto a pocket knife. Not exactly a tough job.Threw it out and went to Home Depot to get one that didn't break."
3,Not very durable,It is not very durable. Brought it for the T8 bit which broke during its initial use with medium force. Good price and quality for light work only. Have to return for refund since replacement option is not available.
4,Dinosaur Movie - Maybe for Older Kids,"I bought this movie for my 2 1/2 year old for Christmas, because he loves dinosaurs, and I remember loving this movie when I was a kid. I wish I had re-watched it before watching with him, because I think there are some parts that would be a little better waiting until he is older (spoiler - the mom of the Brontosaurus dying, Sarah the Triceratops being really stubborn/mean.) Other than that, the movie is just as I remembered, a cute dinosaur movie for kids."
5,Great Movie!,This is a great movie! My daughter LOVES it! She loves anything with animals in it and has watched this about a dozen times already!
4,The Land Before Time,"The Land Before Time is a wonderful movie about a group of five young dinosaurs looking for the Great Valley, the only source of food and water left in their world. Balancing humourous, dramatic, and scary scenes in equal measure, it's an excellent film, particularly for the young.The animation in this movie is excellent. The adult dinosaurs can be a bit awkward looking at times, but the main characters are always exquisite, and there's one scene in particular where a group of flying dinos fight over a berry that's brilliance.It's a great movie for kids, and adults will like it too. The characters are well developed, the story moves along, and it teaches some good lessons to children. Highly recommended."
4,Wonderful Movie,"This is a wonderful movie, I remember it well from my childhood and was very pleased to be able to relive it with this DVD. The picture quality isnt quite what we have come to see from recent films but the DVD makers have done a decent job adapting the film to this format and I did not have any issues watching on my large TV- it did not seem grainy at all."
2,"Good movie, TERRIBLE DVD quality","This is a great movie I recall from my childhood, but upon buying it to share with my family, I was appalled at how poor the DVD quality is. Aside from the lack of widescreen, the video is very grainy, to a point that had you not known you might think this movie was animated in the 1960s. It's a shame at the price and for an ""Anniversary Edition"" more care wasn't taken to provide a quality product."
1,Worst digital transfer I've ever seen.,"I'm absolutely baffled why any studio would let such a poor digitally transferred movie ever see the light of day on DVD. It's REALLY BAD.My advice, don't buy. Force the studio to redo this DVD. Don't settle for such terrible quality."
5,my girls can't get enough of Little Foot!,"My (almost)3 and 5 yr old girls love these movies. this is the favorite of course, being the first one. I don't mind watching it again and again with them. good lessons."
2,"mildly entertaining, having Scottish Huns!","As a student of history, I was curious to see how ""the Scourge of God"" was going to be handled. I went in there realizing that it would not be the exact story, but all the same I was disappointed. I would not recommend that anyone who wants to know about the real Attila gets this filem, because you will not do well on the history quiz. Case in point: In the film Attila bravely kills his older brother Bleda in a duel and then takes the throne himself. In real life the two ruled jointly until Attila had Bleda murdered. Personally, I gravitated towards Bleda in this film. It's not easy being in someone's shadow!That being said, it was actually rather fun to watch."
1,Attila never looked this good.,"OK if this was about a hot guy doing a fashion show with an Atilla theme I'd say yep you are watching the right film. As for historical accuracy and realism, you can throw this right out the window. Half the film you saw the main character riding his horse looking all too good looking for a man that was really a killer. The movie was uneventful and I could see it as a less than B film. Butlers acting was just ok. Didn't do anything for me and he certainly was not meant for this role, 300 yes, Attila no. Considering he was filming Dracula 2000 at the same time, maybe he did two bombs at once. Both films were the pits."
3,Attila the huney,"A very entertaining mini-series about a powerful leader in historywho helped Rome in its demise as a mighty empire. Attila is played bya scottish actor relatively unknown, Gerard Butler. He fills the rolewith all the charisma and virility of a larger than life leader of theHuns. Powers Boothe is excellent as his adversary of the Roman General.Butler, however, is not the image I've always had of Attila the Hun, butwhat the heck, if he'd looked like Gerard, there would have been a lot lesspillaging, raping and sacking on his way to victory!"
1,Oh brother!,Don't even waste your time or money on this very unscholarly piece of work. The author's lack of education in theology is very evident. If you're looking for truth don't go here.
4,Follow up to Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum,"Nothing beats The Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum for U2. This is the next release after Rattle and Hum and comes closest to rival Joshua Tree. Their popularity was on a quick rise after Rattle and Hum and Achtung Baby just brought U2 to absolute main stream. Great tunes, great songs. Definitely worth the buy. Definitely most artistic album I think."
1,Uber Bad Condition,"Wow, what a disappointment. Don't get me wrong; I'm sure the Uber Edition is Uber Excellent, but the condition of the one I received was shameful. It had clearly been opened and had someone try and look at it as they had ripped the box that the set comes in. When you're paying over 400 bucks for a collectors edition (supposedly) you expect to get it in collectable condition; no? Not from Amazon I'm afraid. So my options are to deal with it - not likely, or send it back - which I'm doing. So who now has to pay to send a damaged item back to the US from Australia despite it clearly being Amazon's problem? Yep, good guess, me. What a joke. I have bought from Amazon for a very long time, but am starting to question it as more and more goods are damaged when they get here and it is clear they are damaged from the way they are packed. Lift your game Amazon. Just because you're number one doesn't mean you get to treat customers with contempt."
5,The best U2 album.....,"This album has to be one of the highlights of U2's long and lustrious career. I really love the way they incorporate middle eastern rhythms and dance/techno into their progressive style of rock. MYSTERIOUS WAYS has to be one of their greatest songs, and the heartfelt ONE is a somber ode to the AIDS epidemic. UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD is one of the best dance tracks of the early '90s, and it is easy to see it as being a real forerunner to the trance songs we hear today. It's an excellent album, and one that should properly be put in the annals as a classic record...a real early '90s showcase."
2,i don't like u2 but ths album is ok,"u2 is kind of annoying to me, but this album is one i had when i was younger so i bought it used. i listen to it occasionally and like the song ""one"""
2,drone,A bunch of whiney music from some left-wing extremists. I tried real hard to find something that I liked on this CD but it never happened.
3,"Fantastic content, flimsy box.","The content in this box is fantastic. Yes, for the more die hard fans some of it is redundant but it's packaged nicely. The only downfall with this boxset is the construction of the actual box itself. The bottom tray is extremely difficult to pull out. I pulled the bottom tray out completely and discovered that the upper tray is tilted at an angle which puts a lot of pressure on the tray when you're trying to slide it out. Which also caused the front of the bottom tray to rip already. For the price I would have expected a higher quality and a better quality check."
3,"Some great songs, some lousy songs","There are some incredible songs here, and some some lousy ones, but one thing troubles me throughout -- why is the production so fuzzy and tinny? Maybe it's for effect, but I find it annoying.Joshua Tree is better overall, but there are some terrific pieces here (zoo, one, cruel, mysterious ways, fly). Ultraviolet has too many ""Baby's"" in it (Baby baby baby baby baby baby light my waaaay...). Nearly all of this album is musically very interesting (except for the lousy production), but the vocals on some (love is blindess, ultraviolet, acrobat, throwin arms), really bug me; they remind me of the insipid vocals on most of ""Atomic Bomb."""
5,Excellent Baby,Double the fun. The original album was almost perfect and the extras are almost as good. Contiues the nice job they are doing on their double remasters.Achtung Baby (2 CD Deluxe Edition)
5,One of the great Ones,I unabashedly love U2 and this is my favorite by far. i never tire of the inventiveness on this album. From the opening salvo roar of the edge to the quiet finale. This for me is one of the greatest Rock and Roll albums.
3,Not What I Expected,"I purchased this book to prepare for the Florida K-6 Elementary Teacher Certification Exam based on the other reviews. Although I can't say that the book isn't a worthy guide for some of the certification exams, it isn't subject matter based and the emphasis is on theories and approaches to education. The exam I have to take emphasizes actual subject area content and this book is not helpful for that at all. In order to study for the subject area certification, I recommend a GED review guide."
3,"Great recipes, but too much history","The recipes are great, well explained, and with phenomenal pictures. I also enjoyed learning how ducks are farmed and how the force-feed process works, so I can better understand why animal right rights activists complain.However, I find it unacceptable to see so many pages dedicated to the history of Foie Gras, while only 2 pages cover a key part of cooking foie gras, which is how to clean and prepare it. And there are no pictures of that procedure."
2,Astral City DVD review,"Astral City was perhaps not quite what I was expecting, it was well done and admirable from many points of view, but it would suit the catholic belief system better than my own. It was a bit old fashioned in its concepts, predictable, I would not recommend it unless the buyer were a catholic, it might be nice for them to see. It offers maybe a different way of looking at what's next."
3,Well done with some disconnects,The message is great. The purgatory portion of the film will be questioned by many. But the overall message of love and reincarnation as a way for the soul to learn and gain wisdom is terrific. A enjoyable movie which will make you think about your life and priorities. It is subtitled. BnB Beatles Depot
2,Interesting concept...,"but not scriptural even from a Douai version. It is a concept promoted by a medium and how that medium feels about the ""good"" he is doing for the ""stuck in Limbo"" folk. The movie borrows from many sources, but relies more on the Roman Catholic dogma. I gave it 2 stars because this medium gave his book which I'd call a ""religious stew"", a shined and polished look, and patted himself on the back all at once. This movie is a great example of how people can make money off stew that has absolutely no nutritional value."
3,Please do something!,"I love how people try to defend this guy. ""Oh, this is just a setup book, yadda, yadda, yadda."" As far as I'm concerned brotherless Shaido, how many houses will support Elayne and the fact that EVERY OTHER LINE READS ""She smoothed her dresses"" does not constitute a stetup book for me. Worst book of series, not worst of all time."
2,No end in sight,"More endless conversation, more nattering women.... Oh, and lots and lots of descriptions of dresses. Worst of all, no end in sight."
1,Two thumbs down,I won't read another Jordan book. This series started wonderfully. I was totally enthralled. Now I think the series has become as much of a chore to write as it is to read.The book was great bed time reading. It put me to sleep in 15 minutes without fail.Perhaps Robert Jordan should take a page from Michael Jordan and just retire.
3,"Long on detail, short on plot advancement","First, let me say that I love the WOT series and I think that Jordan is a very good writer. He has created an incredible universe of the mind. However, I think that he has no idea how to finish this story. The book is almost complete before Rand even makes an appearance! I have students who don't know how to finish a paragraph and just start rambling on, sharing everything they know about the topic without being able to wrap it up. This book makes me think of them. I'm getting the distinct impression that Jordan either doesn't want to leave or can't find a way to leave the WOT universe."
2,sleeping Witches,The book was the slowest ever! The women you want to strangle; and where was Rand and Nyneave in the story. Nothing happened! We were left hanging for the last two books. RJ leave out some of the background and move the story on.
2,Prologue,"After reading book 9 I thought ""next book will have more action"", but alas no. Looks like Jordan wrote a prologue to book 10 and then went ""heck why not just make it into an entire book"". I'm soory to say this but it looks more like an attempt to making more money they writing like he did the first 8 books (wich just happen to be the best books ever written)."
2,This book goes nowhere,"I have only one thing to say to Mr. Jordan, move the story along at a faster pace. It is so incredibly frustrating to wait so long for each book to come out, and to then be so disappointed by the last 4 books. Please listen to all your readers and write the story like you did up until ""A Crown of Swords"", because I for one am fast losing my patience with the plodding pace of the last 4 books and if the next one isn't great I will no longer be reading the Wheel of Time series."
2,NO PLOT ADVANCEMENT,"This book goes nowhere! Non of the loose-ends from book nine were tied in this book. In fact, you could skip it entirely and not miss anything. The book had no conclusion what-so-ever and feels like the first half of a much longer edition. I hope Jordan has already written the second half and will be releasing it soon!"
1,"Too bad there's no ""Zero Stars"" rating......","...because this dog of a series deserves it. Like most of the folks who've written reviews, I was also enthralled by the first four or five ""Wheel of Time"" books, but have been increasingly disappointed since then. The quick pace and tight plotting of those first books gave way to the bloated, glacially-paced anchor-dragging navel-gazing that has come to characterize Jordan's most recent WOT books. His obvious disdain for his fans seems to be surpassed only by his greed."
3,Poor but I still have some hope,I feel I could have skipped this book in the series and miss out on nothing. Most everyone stays in the same situation they began in. The Elayne story was boring at best. The others were okay. Some parts were written very well and others left much to be desired.
1,Cure for Insomnia or For Mashchists Only,Very very very very bad.I'm sure those enjoying this book must also love reading & musing about ingredient labels on the most simple food stuff.Tor and Robert Jordan should be ashamed for the train wreck they've allowed to happen. So much promise and potential down the drain.
1,Jumbled mess.,"I read the reviews for this book before I bought the paperback. I hoped against hope that this book could possibly contain some shred of what made the first ones great. Well, you know what they say about getting your hopes up. I'll not rehash what most of 2300 people have already said about this waste of space of a book. Just know it's a jumbled mess of a book where nothing happens and women pull on their hair while giving each other dirty looks. A far cry from where this formerly great series started."
1,Why can't I give a book ZERO stars?,"Put a gun to my head and paint the wall with my brains. Book ten is the WORST ""Robot"" Jordan book to date. I am beginning to become impatient with his lack of creativity and excessive frivilous details. And hey, seriously, nothing happens in this entire book. I can make a list of things that are more constructive and entertaining than reading this book.1. Painting a Self-Portrait2. Doing Community Service3. Calling Old Friends4. Watching Paint Dry5. Learning Yoga....The list goes on....Seriously, DO NOT BUY THIS GOD-FORSAKEN BOOK, its only another letdown, in a series of obvious dissappointment. I want my time and money back."
1,Give us our money back!,This was junk. I have been a devoted Jordan fan since 1995. I've told all my freinds how great the series is and what an exceptional writer Robert Jordan is. I never thought Robert would make me out to be a lier. I just don't get it. Did he forget what a sword and fantasy novel is? How does he publish a book that has no action in it whatsoever? My advice to Jordan is try agian. It has occured to me that he's prolonging this series to get money. And I would hope that no author would go this low to solicite money. If he need $ he could of just asked for donations. That way there wouldn't be extra space in my closet taken up with this poor excuse for a fantasy novel.Some would say that he's just trying to fulfill his vision of a fantasy novel much the same way George Lucas makes Star Wars- for himsef first and the public second. In which case I say fine. Just give us our money back robert! That way we don't feel so cheated.
1,Waste of Time,"Reading reviews of this book is more entertaining than the book itself. If Jordan was attempting to deliver anything other than a cash cow for his personal fortune, he failed miserably. The book delivers no plot movement, and for those of you who have defended Mr. Jordan saying he was putting the context in place for a rousing finale, how many books of context do you need?This was once one of my favorite series, but I will never again purchase one. I found myself 500 pages with less action than occurred in the first 100 of ""Eye of the World"". It became a labor to pick up the book to finish it."
1,Worthless,"I've been a fanboy up to this point but this book was a chore to read, the chapters about Elayne and Egwene actually had me skipping pages knowing I would miss nothing and hoping for them to just end. I have never done that in a book before and I am pretty disgusted this worthless collection of rambling thoughts was ever published.I give it 1 star for lack of a lower numeral in the rankings."
1,Don't bother,"What ever happened to the rule ""don't write anything that doesn't develop characters or plot""? This is the worst installment in the series to date. If you like to buy books for no reason I highly recommend Crossroads of Twilight. This book was published for an extra paycheck. Almost nothing happens. More Aes Sedai (hundreds at this point) running around whining and bellyaching. Perrin is still searching, and with the exception of about ten pages, nothing worth reading. Mat is interacting with the DotNM, and has about twenty pages worth reading. Rand has five pages. Egwene has one page worth reading, but that is no surprise because she has been boring me since Shadow Rising. Did I mention Elayne, there's no need to. There is also about fifteen pages about the inner workings in the White Tower and some Darkfriends worth reading, otherwise don't bother.This book was written to extend the series. My recommendation is save your money."
1,This the worst book I've ever read!,"This book is sooo bad that the only positive I can derive from it is sharing my misery with all the good folks on this message board.If you haven't read this yet, don't do it! It is gloriously awful! Literally nothing happens. There is nothing redeeming about it."
1,Jordan appears to have taken a wrong turn...,"I agree with the readers who found this book to be another filler. Jordan has now got so many plotlines going that even were he to advance them all at a reasonable pace, still the overall story gets along about as fast as my aged grandmother!I guess at least he's consistent. I see the male and female characters still ""interact"" at the same idiot level of full-time misunderstanding. Jordan's creator appears to have made men to be hen-pecked, and women to smooth their skirts.680 pages (in the edition that I read) and all in all Egwene gets caught. Fullstop. That's all folks..."
1,"Please, make it stop!","Nothing happens! I eventually managed to read the entire book, but it was a frustrating ordeal. The author has seemingly lost control over the characters and the story. This book could have easily been cut in half or more but for the increadible amounts of agonizing detail stuffed into every moment. What was once the best series that fantasy had to offer has gone stale and flat."
2,Jordan Phones It In,"The 10th book of a series that should have found it's end 5 books ago. Again Robert Jordan releases a book that merely trudges on with the storyline, the same old characters doing the same old things, this is half a book with nothing approaching an ending in it. While it's a good chance to revisit the world of The Wheel of Time, it's not more than a fleeting glimpse at a few days of nothing special."
2,WOT=Waste of Time?,What was once my favorite fantasy series is now my biggest frustration. Somehow Jordan has practically made me lose interest after 9 great books. This book is nothing but filler. It looks like they increased the font size (really) and gave us half of a book where everything happens in the 2nd half. That would be a way to make a good profit. This is the big book about nothing. I was warned ahead of time by some friends that nothing really happens in this book and they were right. Read with very low expectations. The only thing good about it is it is a quick read due to fewer words per page.
1,Stalling and fluff,"I have read the earlier books in this series multiple times, although I agree that the last one or two had slowed down in pace. I do not mind the highly introspective tone of Jordan's narratives that seems to bother other readers. I held on to the belief that they were in fact ""set up"" books for something ahead.However, this book has made me decide to abandon the Wheel of Time series. It have such a passive feel that I had to look back through the book to verifiy that anything at all had taken place. Jordan is fond of hints and innuendos, but by themselves such tricks cannot sustain a book of this size. In the end, I think that Jordan's writing style has gotten so fluffy and long-winded that he can no longer fit a book's worth of activity into even a 700 page book.If you loved the last two books, then you should enjoy this one too. If you -- like me -- were hoping for Crossroads of Twilight to redeem the series, then take my advice: Now is the time to walk away."
2,How slow can you go???,"With the first 6 books of the Wheel of Time series, Robert Jordan has proven that he is a most brillant writer. With the last 4 books however, he has proven that he knows how to crush momentum and interest- and Crossroads of Twilight seems to be the worst of them all. I say ""seems"", because I have not yet finished the book. I am just over 400 pages into it, however, and NOTHING has happened. Minor characters are described and analyzed in painstaking detail, as are plots, subplots, settings, etc. Detail is good...but too much (WAY too much) of a good thing, isn't. If the last four books were written with the same flair and strength as the first 6, this would have been the last and greatest book. Jordan had established himself as a veritable legend with the first 6 books. Comparisons to Tolkien were VERY appropriate. Now, he needs to be succinct and INTERESTING in his last few to pull the series out of mediocrity and back into greatness."
1,crossroads of twilight,"what started as a great epic fantasy is unfortunately losing its pace, crossroads is more of a traffic jam with nobody(characters)moving. this series quickly got me hooked but the latest installment just got me mad, come on jordan, lets wrap it up. if your eagerly awaiting the paperback release wait til the next book comes out as croosroads goes nowhere, maybe the story will move in the next book."
1,are we being made fools of?,"jordans previous books were saved from his terrible, tedious writing style by some great action set pieces,some interesting leaps of imagination and, with rand, a compelling manichaean conflict but in the latest instalment there are no redeeming features. jordan appears to have no literary merit, his writing is graceless and his characterisation hackneyed and weak. the women are caricatures and so are the men, an assembly of cliches who mouth platitude after platitude. does every layer of clothing need to be described in such ridiculous detail, does every thought need to be forced upon us so, does he have an editor. jordan appears to think that every little thing needs to be spelt out to us again and again to the extent that one feels he thinks we lack sufficient intelligence to understand the most simplistic of notions and ideas. by continuing to buy this mind numbingly boring drivel he has spawned of late we may just be proving him right."
2,Can anyone tell me whar really happened?,"I believe the answer to this question is nothing happened in this book. Now I am a livid fan of this series, but honestly the characters did nothing but mosey around thier plots and nothing was accomplished. The descriptions were as always good, the dialogue was consistant with the other volumes, but the complete lack of any action, story conclusions, plot tie ups, or any progression of the story left me wondering if it is going to be worth picking up the 11th volume. (is it just me or were there only supposed to be 10 volumes three or so years ago) In addition I feel jipped, this book wasn't worth the twenty or so dollars I spent on it. In all actuallity I think it might be worth the hassle of skipping the tenth novel and simply wait for the eleventh, I don't see where any one will miss anything.Sorry if this offends."
2,Will this Age ever end?,"If you are anticipating Robert Jordan's newest Wheel of Time installment to merely weave the tale more tightly and leave even more questions without a single answer, then I strongly recommend ""Crossroads of Twilight."" However, if you are expecting book ten to reveal even a glimmer of an answer or wrap up any of the subplots, I would not- at least not until the eleventh book is released! Most of the characters are revisited and their situations updated, but no real advancements in the plot or subplots are made. We know barely any more at the end of ""Crossroads..."" then we do at the beginning. You must eventually read this book to continue on to the next. But, since we probably have another two years to wait for book eleven, I see no reason to read it now. Whether you read it now or wait until the next Wheel of Time release, remember patience is a virtue."
1,Where's the rest of the story?,"This book goes absolutely nowhere. I thought maybe several hundred pages fell out of the end and I missed all the action. I'm kind of curious how long Mr. Jordon thinks people will keep paying for books that don't move the plot at all. I forgave him for book #9 thinking that he was building up to a blowout in book #10. But....nothing. Hundreds and hundreds of pages of characters that I don't care about talking about nothing important or advancing the story in any way. You've profited enough from me, Mr. Jordan. Never again. Why isn't there a zero star rating?"
1,a waste of time,what was the great thing about this story NOTHING!!!He's just trying to make it longer so he can get more moneyi loved all his storys some more than others but this one has nothing to like about it . It is his worst book ever im almost afraid to read the next one
1,"Stout wool, fine silk, and dressmaking...again.","If you hate action and want to learn more about the cut of a dress, then this book is for you. After struggling with action, fighting, and a plot at the first of this series RJ has finely come into his own with even more detailed detail. I can now spot good stout wool from across the room."
1,"Lethargic, at best","This book read like the poetry my teachers made me read in high school: wonderfully written, but it never really went anywhere. It takes a good two thirds of the book to get chronologically past the end of ""Winter's Heart"" and even after that the plot barely moves. As another reviewer already said, you could simply read the last chapter and be up to date. There are no real shocking plot twists, and no real character development. I would reccomend checking this out from a library when they get it, or at the very least waiting until it comes out in paperback. I certainly wish I hadn't wasted my money."
2,A new worst book in the series!,"I normally don't like to read books during the school year because they take away from reading school books, but I find my self more interested in school work than reading this book. It's almost a chore. Unfortuately I'm only 1/2 way through the book. If you want to read this book just to keep up with the story, wait for paperback or go to your local library. It's not worth it."
2,RJ: Who are you and what have you done with the real RJ?,"What started out as the most amazing story I have ever read has turned into so much drivel. After nearly 300 pages the characters, if you can call them that now, from this book have finally caught up to events from the LAST book. Which, of course, means that by the end of this book the story will have advanced an extremely minute amount. Enough with the going around is circles from one meaningless event to the next, get on with it. I don't particularly care how many books you write in the series as long as they have a purpose. This one, along with the last one, have been utterly stagnant in plot advancement."
1,The worst yet,"This is definately the worst of the series so far. I agree that you could easily skip this book altogether. This book frustrated me to no end in that all storylines carried over from the last book were left unresolved and the only progression is that we now understand the different characters intentions. It is not enough to simply learn a few details while you read 600 some odd pages of dialogue and observations while the plot of the characters I have grown to love did not advance at all. At all! I just cant understand how Robert Jordan could let this go to publish. I have to remind myself when reading this that this is the same guy who wrote Eye of the World, Great Hunt, and Dragon Reborn which in my opinion standing by themselves comprises one of the greatest fantasy epics ever written. Unfortunately Jordan has hit rock bottom with this latest installment."
1,Not worth reading,"The same characters - zero plot development - yet it's hundreds of pages and costs as much as a real novel. I've been ripped off by the last three books, and I'm to the point of being angry and ashamed that I bought this."
1,Who are these characters?,"After swimming through all of these reviews, I had to make my own comment. I started this series when it first came out, and have re-read it twice to refresh my memory for the new releases. All I can say is that book 11 is the only one I did not yet buy, instead borrowing it from the library, and am glad I did. Why is RJ compelled to re-introduce characters we weren't interested in the first time? I find myself going to the glossary trying to remember them, only to find an obscure geographical name that no one cares about. I guess I need to tug on my braid, smooth my dress, and skim past these sections. Who cares about every noble in Andor? Not me. I want to read about the characters that kept me interested these long years. Please, Mr. Jordan, finish the story!"
3,The Long Drawn out Process of Jordan,Ok Ok Mr Jordan you have written some really good books # 1 thru 7 then you wrote 8 and blew it in my eyes. Out comes 9 after waiting FOREVER again and I can say I enjoyed it. Now here is book 10 and we spend 90% of the book in the past before the end of book 9. Hello.....I'm not a 5 year old and I didn't need half of this explained to me! Sixhundredeighty pages and we advanced what??? maybe a week from the time they clean the taint??? And it gets mentioned what twice? I think it's time to write for story and quit writing for money. I won't buy more
1,Crossroads of Twilight,This book could have gone unwritten.It gave me not much insight to the Dragon reborns adventure and didn't advance the story line. This book only talked about the other charachters who may or may not have been germain to the advancement of the saga. I was left wondering why did I waste my time reading this book when I probably could have waited for next issue and there would not have been a gap in the story line.
3,"Intricate Details, and Politcal Scheems.","I must agree with seveal reviews I have already read, that Robert Jordan may just be writing now to fill his bank account, but at the same time, the way he writes is not all action and thins blowing up. This, is a book only for thoes that can follow plot after plot after plot, and have atleast a basic understanding of political intregue and hidden meaning. Quite frankly, most of his readers, in order to understand all of his works you have to read into everything like a Cairhienan. Most of this book and the one before it has been for ""Set up purposes"" to arange where things will be going. Yes, you should read into what the people you've never heard of before are doing. If you can not follow where all of the information is going, like following 1000 lines to 10000 different points, than perhaps this is just a filler book for you."
1,The worst of the WOT yet!,"I really enjoyed the series and was wildly excited for the 8th and 9th book. The Path of Daggers diappointed me since it took forever just to do a few items. The plot is slowing.I ordered the 10th book hoping that the plot would start moving. Unfornunately, this last book was the worst of all. The characters appear weak and Rand has just about stopped doing anything.The best part was the beginning with Mat and that just left the reader hanging.The worst thing is that 3 months after I read the book, I could not remember if I had read the book or anything about it. If a book is not memorable, it is a failure.I think if the next book comes out,I will not waste my money, but buy it used in the forlone hope that the editor is doing his job to tighten the plot and advance the action of the book."
2,Ummmm....,"Forget about the reviews helping me. Lets talk about helping Mr. Jordan. My advice? MAKE... SOMETHING... HAPPEN!!!! PLEEEASE!! For the love of God, if I have to wade through another novel where absolutely nothing exciting happens, I'm just going to start writing my own Wheel of Time novels. I think I'll start by reducing the number of proper names in the book from, like, A BILLION, to a more manageable number like, say, six. And I'll give them easy names like Bob or Mary. Oh, and I'll also remember to make the names vastly different instead of having three characters named Bob, Baub, And Borb. I swear, I spent the whole novel just trying to remember who the hell everyone was because the last one I read was during the Carter administration. Seriously, the first six books, were awesome, but I'm starting to wonder if even Robert knows where this series is going. After ""Crossroads"" I'm guessing no where."
