1,Save your money - DO NOT BUY!,"I have owned this recorder since October 2003 and it worked wonderful for about 12 months or so. Right after the one-year warranty mark was over...it started to shut itself off. Sometimes it would go as much as 50 minutes before shutting off and other times, it shuts off the first couple of minutes. Either way, I have tried calling customer support prior to the warranty period being offer, and they insisted that I have received a replacement unit. Not true. To be honest, I cannot tell you how many times or hours I have wasted with these people and got nothing. I am going to sale the lame thing in my garage sale for probably $25.00....that is $325.00 less than what I bought it for. It's worthless....but another brand. I will never ever in this lifetime own any other product by Philips again. Very bad customer service."
1,educated but an annoyance,"Thiis book may serve its importance int the anthropology's eyes; however, this book lacks its excitement or interest in my eyes. Lots of mix messages that I care none about. So boring."
3,A Decent First Effort,"Judge Napolitano should be given credit for tackling such important subject matter. This work calls attention to serious issues facing our legal system from top to bottom. Unfortunately this attempted ideological message reads more like a laundry list of complaints than a comprehensive philosophy. I don't feel it was written particularly well, and the lack of citations is inexcusable. This is Judge Napolitano's first book. I look forward to his future works but expect a little growth."
4,Next best thing to a Foley fork,"I was broken-hearted when I broke off a tine on my faithful Foley fork, which I've had for about 30 years. Of course they aren't made anymore, and I didn't know how I would manage without it - I used it all the time. I hunted all over for something that could replace it and was thrilled to find this. It isn't exactly the same, but pretty close. I'm sure once I'm used to it I'll be just as attached to it and hopefully it will last me as long (I bought 2 of them just in case)."
3,African Portraits,"I am not sure whether or not the album is also a part of a stage play. One of my favorites is the Victor Nelson's Cottonfield featuring Jevetta Steele as solist. It is often played every Sunday in the Chicago area in the Gospel timespan. Most of the other songs are filled with rich african ethnicity, an enjoyabale and entertaining album. I would like to know more about Hannibal and was this album from a broadway play. Either way you will be thoroughly entertained."
2,Less than I hoped,"Perhaps this is more a case of high expectations than a poor product, but I was disappointed in this DVD. Let's start with the packaging; the case and sleeve art give the DVD a ""home-made"" look. Also, I thought this was a new documentary; on the contrary, it was originally produced in 1995. The narration is overly dramatic and the text adds nothing in the way of increased knowledge on the subject matter. The music is a distraction at best and annoying at worst. The one redeeming quality and why I did not rate it 1 star: there are MANY images and film clips that I have never seen in any other documentary covering the German/Russian conflict, and I have watched hundreds of hours on the subject. Overall, as a history lesson or for sheer entertainment value, I cannot recommend this product."
4,My review,"An insightful look at one of the bloodiest wars in history. Lots of information about this time in history, accompanied by compelling, rare footage. A very interesting film!"
5,This CD is amazing,"Not only is this my favorite utters Album so far, it is my favorite album i own so far. The swingin' utters do punk rock at it's best, and whats more, they add their own style, so it doesn't sound like every other punk band. They are original, and they rock harder than any band i've ever heard."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I purchased this a year ago and already need to replace the speed sensor. Polar does not offer battery changes for the sensors, only the receiver. You will need to purchase a new sensor (speed, cadence) each time a battery dies. This can be pretty expensive after a few years. I tried to find a system that offers both heart rate and replaceable batteries and most are very expensive to purchase. Polar has a lock on the pulse rate market and it would be good business sense for a company to design a good inexpensive heart-rate bicycling computer."
4,Voltron DVD,Almost perfect (9 out of 10). I would've given it a 10 out of 10 except they forgot to cut out all the 'dead space' when they deleted the commercials.
2,Unsubstantiated information,"Sorry. What appears to be described herein are deals that are just the ordinary way of doing business; not only in Texas but, also, everywhere. While surely devious and unethical, there are the usual winners and losers. Hence the admonition ""let the buyer{investor) beware"". Had the author selected one or two situations and proceded to unravel them from inception to disposition, he would have a viable argument. However, therein could be a risk of libel. Therefore, this book has lots of suspect and unorganized information."
1,dvd,"quality barely watchable,did""nt get past second episode.Not what I was expecting as I have watched older movies and series on dvd that were much better sound and picture wise!"
1,Flambards a Shambles,"I wish I hadn't purchased this item. It wass poorly acted, very poorly directed, and the music was so out of place it was distracting."
4,Blueprints-medicine,"Blueprints series is overall pretty good. The Medicine book is a quick read that will give the reader a sufficient amount of knowledge and detail regarding that subject matter, however I think that it is appropriate to supplement some of the chapters with Cecil's to get a full understanding of the material. Overall, I recommend this book because it is a quick read and it isnt in the ""bullet"" style format that many of the books are- but rather in a flowing paragraph form."
3,###,i got the table very fast (befor the date they gave me) and the paddings are great.the only thing i realy dont like about this table is that its SHORT!! im 5'1 and i have it on the last hole!!! so.. think about that...enjoy!
1,Need more description,"The price was great. The idea from the description was that it was a standard massage table. When I received it, the table was only 24"" wide. From a professional standpoint I need a table to be at least 27"" wide. The table looks good but it was definitely too narrow. I sent it back. I found most of the descriptions for massage tables lacking in width and length dimensions. It would be nice if this was remedied."
1,Cheap table,I had this for about 5 years then just left it out by the dump. The problem is the craftsmanship. It is really comfortable and serves its purpose but the wood it really cheap and it breaks. The plastic cups that hold the wood beams broke and you cant repair them. I contacted the company and they would not return any calls I left. Besides that the adjusting height on the table is a big pain. You have to unlock each leg and move them. I would not get this if your comparing it to others.
4,excellent value,We have had the table for a few weeks and love it!! It's easy to set up and is even more well-made than we expected considering the great price.
3,Buy smaller kit,"If you must have a ""kit,"" I would suggest buying a smaller, cheaper version. The Safety1st Hospital's Choice kit is only $9.99 and includes the basics...thermometer, nasal aspirator... but in addition it includes a baby nail clipper (the EFB version doesn't). It has a nice small carrying case for a diaper bag. However, I think it would be a better investment overall to buy a high-quality thermometer, because it is something you will need for a long time, and buy the other things you may need separately."
3,"Good, though poorly organized.","At once, this book is amazing in its scope but horribly frustrating in its approach. Unlike a conventional encyclopedia, this voluminous tome orders the films within by year rather than alphabetically. This system makes the book virtually useless when trying to find a particular film at a glance. Sure, there's always the index but that fails miserably when a reader has interest in a film with a foreign title. Translated titles are available in the index, but too many foreign films have multiple titles. To make things worse the index is bereft of directors, stars, or any other means of cross-referencing a movie with which the reader might not be fully familiar. This is a flawed and ultimately ineffective work. (ISBN: 0879518812)"
3,"Good quality, works well.","The skewers fit my mountain bike perfectly and are attractive. The key works fine, and fits in my saddle bag without taking much room (unlike the the Pinhead key I lost).I downgraded this two stars because unlike the picture showing the product, ONLY ONE KEY IS INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE AND THERE IS NO WAY TO BUY ANOTHER KEY. Had the picture shown only one key and a replacement key could be ordered, I would have given this 5 stars. I really hate being lied to or misled by a company."
5,Good deterrant,"These are light in weight as described. If the jerks, opportunists, and criminals want to take your wheel or bike, they will with enough preparation and effort. However, these skewers will make them think twice for a easier target."
3,so so,The key chain was a hit with my hubby but the chain broke almost immediately. But we reconnected to his other key chain. The figure is still good.
4,Solid Sequel,I dont know what the 1st 2 reviewers are talking about nights is a solid release there is options far as the controller scheme so you arent stuck with lousy wii controls i prefer the classic controller the graphics are good game play is smooth bottom line this game doesnt dissapoint go buy this game you will not be disappointed.
5,Nights,"Excellent seller but the game sucks Nights is horrible creation it's a kids game :( darn you Sega lol, but the seller has perfect reviews the game itself made me cry."
5,Great Books,These books by Beverly and Tom Rodgers are fantastic books with great help and easy to understand and real down to earth living!!
5,Fun little truck/car set,"My 27mth loves this toy, plays with it every day. Made from recycled rubberwood, it is very durable and eco-friendly. The vegi dyes allow you to see the patina of the wood, and gives parental comfort that there are no harmful chemicals to worry about. My son puts all his cars on it to take to get fixed, his wooden animals and people take rides, and even his Playmobil guys catch rides on the back of this. The rig has great turning radius, and trailor and rig are interchangable with other Plan City trucks. Supper fun and functional toy. Really allows for a lot of creativity."
4,Great toy,"It is a nice addition to my 2 year old's wooden car selection.I like how open ended and sturdy they are. He is two and gets really frustrated that the truck and bed comes off so easily. They are connected by one little parts and come apart very easily when the child is not careful. I think older he gets, the easier it would be to play with this particular truck."
3,Good and Simple -Worth the [price range],"It appears very straightforward and easy to use. Not a lot of bells and whistles, but you can edit anything in most standard text applications. It is probably a 4 star for its inexpensive price, but I am a hard grader and it was not in Mac format. I was able to load it on Virtual PC and then view the individual files (without the silly Windows front end, which was fine, but just not really needed) on my Mac, so I was not too unhappy. It has all the basic legal forms, but I suspect most people will only need two or three in their life (the problem is which ones), so it is nice to have them all on one disk. I wanted it for a simple Will and I am willing to read a book and make my own changes without a lot of help. If you're a Microsoft fool, it will let you use the macro feature (you must disable the macro virus protection first) in Word 2000 to fill in the forms."
4,It is a swim cap!,Bought one. Wore it from Feb to June. It ripped in June. Bought 2 more. Only wear these in the pool to save my hair from the chlorine. I don't find these snug at all and I have a big head.
1,bad quality,"I bought it for my 7 yr old and within the first few weeks, when he was trying to get it off his head, it just tore. Cant be fixed. Really bad quality."
2,Worst cap for a man with a full sized head,"This cap is so tight and while it works well, it is not comfortable. Once I put it on, it does not maneuver a bit. Would have to take it off and start over.Speedo, you are a 2."
1,Speed silicone swim cap,I received on time. I bought this cap after I read others review. Disappointed. I can't put on my head so small and thin cap. I do not have big head. Should be adult size. Any way I can't wear ...
2,Doesn't Keep Your Hair Dry,"I have a lot of hair. And it wouldn't all fit in here. After I pull it down over my ears, it's perfect but then it keeps inching off so I have to keep pulling it down and so on and so on...."
4,Nice One,I got it on time as always from Amazon!. It is really nice cap for the price. It requires some effort to wear because it seems very delicate so watch your nails.
3,Okay product - not great,"This is the first swim cap that I have ever owned, so I don't really have any way to compare it to others. I bought it so that I wouldn't have to wash and dry my hair every time I went swimming but it didn't work. It seems easy enough to get on and off but it doesn't keep my hair dry.I finally gave up on it and now it is just taking up space in my locker. Lots of other people at the pool use them regularly, though, so maybe I am just not doing it right."
3,Good Quality but tight for an adult,The speedo silicon swim cap is good to wear but its little tight for adults. Its smooth and easy to wear and remove.
4,Color treated hair protection??,I have been swimming for years and trying to figure out how to get the color to stay in my hair for longer. Just now trying the swim cap. After researching various caps decided on the silicone cap. I am wetting my hair down before swimming and rinsing afterwards. After 6 weeks of use the cap started small and now feels large. Half way through the swim I have to readjust it as it is all coming off. My hairline is really low around my face and so my hair does get wet with the pool water. Not sure the color is staying in any better but I am finding my hair is not as dry. I would purchase a silicone cap again. I think it is probably the bast option on the market and certainly better than the old swimming caps I remember of years ago.
3,good,"It is good, but I have a thick hair. Even I pined my hair before,the cap just won't stay on my head. Any way to solve this problem?"
5,Excelente!,lA MUSICA DE ESTE CANTA AUTOR ES MUY BUENA! Y ESTE ES UN DOBLE CD QUE TRAE UN RESUMEN DE SUS EXITOS. MUY BUENA ELECCIÓN!
4,Great Bok,Love this Author and the content. I am using it for one of my College classes. Great buy and great price.
4,said date,i enjoyed this cd.added it to my collection of wu. i would buy more masta killa cds after this purchace
2,Its good...,"It is a decent release however what took so long? The Best REVIEWS for this LP is by Patrick G Varine, Black Rage, & Reginald from Queens, they sum it up perfectly. Consult those before purchasing. For all the haters...WHat UP Check the reviews, I know my MUSIC!!!"
2,Not worthy,"I just bought this set and tried it out in the local pool.I can see where the straps on the fins and goggles might break if you're not careful, but that is not too big a deal for me. The goggles fit fine, and did not fog up for the time in the pool. The snorkel works as this novice snorkeler expected.The fins are Un-friendly however. Because they have an adjustable strap, they would not stay on very well even though I had them tight. And the fins are hard, not flexible which puts a lot of stress on the foot. In just 15 minutes I was mildly bothered by it (Can't imagine after 3 hours in Tulum it would be any better!). I put on the flexy fins that are individually sized at the pool just to see if I was imagining it - and it was immediate relief. I do not recommend this set up because of the fins.Nifty backpack idea though - wish I could return just the fins!"
2,"""Eclectic"" Bread","It's not a typo. Eclectic Bread would be a more suitable title for this book. We have over a dozen books on bread baking and this one does not live up to the other reviews. If you love wild loaves (saucy apple, peaches and cream, maraschino pecan, almond poppy, tropical medley and sweet coconut curry, just to name a few) you may love this book. However, it does not do justice to basic bread making and we were very disappointed with the commercial advertisements found at the back of the book."
4,This is a touching book,"I found this book to be charming, witty, open, intelligent and loving. It is classic Maclaine, complete with her deep interest in all things metaphysical. There is also a warmth that radiates through her writing, you can feel that she truly loves and cares for all her animal companions and especially little Terry.I have always respected and liked Miss Maclaine, but there is a new ""grace"" about her life right now. She says she has found joy and peace because of her relationship with this smart and funny little dog. Who I am to argue?Some people may shrug it all off as ""eccentric fluff"" and I have a feeling that would probably tickle her, but I know the ""animal lovers"" will get it and the spiritual readers will find some interesting wisdom to ponder.This book and its photos share ""down to earth"" glimpses of a unique woman. You might not agree with her spiritual standpoint, but you can't ignore the love she feels for her home,her life and for Terry."
3,"Worth a Read, but not putting Effort into it","This book has many excellent qualities, including interesting characters, a well-developed universe, and a good handling of a grandiose storyline. Unfortunately, the author tends to get incredibly preachy, and has a truly vexing tendency to divide different parts of the world into ""things I like"" and ""things I don't like"". While this sort of writing may well be par for course for this author, the book would have been much better off without it."
3,"Good, but I've been here before","A Plague of Angels is definitely a well-written, engaging story. The combination of science fiction and fantasy elements is effectively done, and the characters are entertaining even though rarely fully-developed. The book's weaknesses would have been easily forgivable if the premise had been as new to me as it was to some of the other reviewers, but for me, it was not breaking new ground.In the early '80s, I read two books by James Kahn, ""World Enough and Time"", and ""Time's Dark Laughter"". These works similarly follow a post-technological world moving back into the realm of myth and legend, but do so far more effectively. It is possible that the main difference is that my standards have changed over the last 20 years, but I sincerely believe that those earlier works were far better developed than ""A Plague of Angels."" If you are familiar with Kahn's work, you may be disappointed by this book, but still, it is an enjoyable read."
4,THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE TEPPER NOVELS..,I REALLY LIKED THE MIXTURE OF GENRES IN THIS BOOK. THE WHOLE ARCHETYPICAL VILLAGE CONCEPT WAS A HOOT. WOULDN'T IT BE LOVELY TO SEND ALL YOUR UNWANTED CHARACTERS TO A VILLAGE AND FORGET THEM. THE REASON THAT ORPHAN'S CHARACTER IS NOT AS WELL ROUNDED AS OTHER HEROINES IS BECAUSE SHE SPENDS THE MAJORITY OF HER LIFE AS AN ARCHETYPE.MY ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS BOOK IS THE ENDING...I LIKE FOR MY FAIRY TALES TO END WITH AND THEY LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER.
2,Not The Quality I Hoped For,"While the base #1 phone is fine, base #2 can only be used near base #1. This makes for inconvenience while trying to walk about with the #2 phone."
1,This book is a scam,"My friend used Management Information Sustems: Managing the Digital Firm 8th edition. Now that I received this one I can see that 95% of of the content in the new book is identical to the one my friend has. Oh, right, the authors also added to the title the words ""essentials of"" Management...I can believe the publisher let the authors publish this kind of book. A previous review says that the book is almost identical to the previous edition of the same book. Now I am saying that the book is almost identical to a different book writen by the same authors...this is outrageous.Ah, yes. The cases at the end of the chapters are different"
5,Does not displace Solti,"This recording does not displace the classic Solti version. But it is a winsome version. I like it better than the Sawallisch with Eva Marton. I prefer Deborah Polaski to Eva Marton. However, none of the two could match Birgit Nilsson's prowess. In a sense, Hildegard Behren's 2 versions are even better. Well, Behren's top notes are more radiant and firm than Marton or Polaski. I think Behrens sings better in her second version with Rysanek's incredible Klytamnestra, and her incredible laughter at the end. But Behren's first version has the ever dramatic and characterful Christa Ludwig. I would recommend the Solti as a first version, but this works as well - it's a good performance but not the best. Barenboim does provide his own insights which is different from Solti."
3,good if your training more than 1 dog,"My husband is reading this and commented that it is more for kennel training. Meaning, you are training more than 1 dog. He did also say that it has some good tips though. He trained our old dog with""gun dog"" and that is kind of antiquainted, so this is a little more 21st century reading."
4,Best of the lot,"Not a lot of ""good"" gun dog books exist. I bought this one to train my GSP, and must admit that it provides a very basic but good approach to training a bird dog. One of the previous reviewers was critical of allowing rabbit chasing, etc. but, remember, the approach rests upon the Delmar Smith method, which shies away from physical discipline. Hence, many of the approaches, although eyebrow raising, are consistent and will deliver results. Ultimately, nothing replaces time, which is essential to spend with your dog in training. With enough time, I recommend this book for the beginner."
5,So Much More is Possible When We Think Together,"This is a tested methodology for 'linking minds' -- and consequently realizing answers and producing insights that are not possible approaching a question or problem on your own. Provided that the group is aligned around a common purpose and no individual seeks recognition at the expense of others, the Thoughtstorm process described in this book will produce a lot of ""Aha!!"" moments. The suggested questions, always preceded by a situation, are valuable to consider. The book is logically organized, concise, and leads to an expanded view of the world."
2,Emphasis on regular people by giving extreme examples.,"My big gripe, which someone has already wisely brought up is that this book emphasizes that one does not need incredible stories to write a great personal essay. However, the example essays are pretty incredible with the whole KGB scenario or a parent having AIDS just before taking the LSATS. Moreover, this book is best for law, business, or med school, and the book is probably more useful for those with a few years of post undergraduate professional work. If you're like me, and you're applying to a general/regular graduate school right after undergaduate school, you will have to really fight hard to extrapolate the concepts needed to write a good essay. My closest example in the book was for an international affairs graduate school with an applicant that had about 10 years of professional drug use........."
5,Great Product - Quick Shipping,"As always, this is the best hairspray I have ever used. I try cheaper brands, but always come back. I was glad to find this good price on Amazon."
5,Best hairspray around,I love this hairspray. It doesn't leave your hair stiff and you can spray and style.
5,This purchase was 4 my wife,My wife has difficulty with her hair so I know she uses the best hairspray she can find. Thank you for offering Sebastian Shaper this is it.
3,Troy losin it,"Troy dun made da mistake of thinkin he fallin off cuz he aint creatin no more controversy. It's because his latest releases have been half-way commercial. Whut does Troy do? The same thing he did to get in the game. Start dissin rappers to make controversy and sell more albums. Somebody explain whut does Lil Jons carreer have to do with Troy? Jack $#@!. Troy is damn near a legend in da ATL like Kast. Legends don't sit around tryin to diss, they get their money. As soon as he realizes this and stops tryin to feed his fans elementary flows his carreer will pick back up."
1,lost cause,This is nothing even compaired to his origonal stuff this cd sucks it's a real good thing i heard it off the net instead of going out and buying this crap. I really used to be a fan of PT his first three cds were good but his last 2 are talentless dribble same stuff that cums out of every rappers mouth once their ego gets to high this is why stars should not get paid as much as they do they all lose their so called talent after the years pass on anyone can brag and act hard and this is proof.
3,"Its Good But it aint ""Universal Soildier"" or ""B.A.M.N.""","Ive always been a fan of P.T. Cruiser(since P.T. for President back in 1999) . After hearing Universal Soilder 2 years ago I still think that,that was his best, well produce, and krunkest album ever. B.A.M.N (By any Means Neccessary) was a great follow up, but it was no Universal Soilder. And now face off pt.2, the almbum is good dont get me wrong but if you get past the beats,(which very few are good like 6 out of 17) and listend to the hooks on most of the songs,thell have u scratching ur head. On the other hands I like how P.T. Reminds people he was once the heart of Hotlanta on the album. I was expecting alot from P.T. this time around when u got T.I. keeping that fire still burning hotter than ever in ATL I was hopping Troy would come and put his fire out, but its still burning."
3,CD review,"Pretty good, the main song I wanted was the Whiskey Lullulby, but some of the other songs are good too. But actually not one of my favorite CD's,did like the price of it, I guess was the best thing about it."
4,Great Study Tool,"I used this e-trainer plus the Sybex CCNA Virtual Lab Gold for 3 weeks and passed 640-507 with a 945/1000 score. The e-Trainer includeds all the text from the Sybex CCNA 2.0 Study Guide, plus animated training, study prep and test questions and evaluations. The Lab excersizes in the e-Trainer map directly to the Labs in the Sybex CCNA Virtual Lab Gold. Great combination for learning at a reasonable price."
3,"Good Start, but to clunky","This was an excellant beginners view of configuring routers; however, the program did not support all of the commands or common shortcuts used. It has a limited number of practice sessions which are fairly weak. Past this, it gave a very good representation of the working environment, it allowed for interface creation and configuration, and it gives a practice network for you to configure. Very good buy for the very beginner, but if you've been doing cisco routers for a while forget it."
1,Parents! Stop and think for a just a second.,"You were young once. Try to cut through the smoke-screen of your memory and really, really think about what you were doing back then. The truth is you were probably horny as all get out. But you would never, ever subject yourself to a ""party"" such as this. And don't be fooled into thinking that the times have changed so drastically that the youth are more open about their bodies than you were.Use good judgement and cut through this B.S."
1,yuck,"I am still a teenager and i bought the book thinking it would be another trashy novel (gossip girl anyone)to add to my collection.. i had not heard anything about it before hand. Once i read it i was shocked its disgusting and totally innapropriat for anyone my age to read. If the author really wanted to make a point that this goes on why did he feel the need for the graphic oral sex scene? ok so oral sex forsure happens in high school but like why was it neccesary to glorify it like something so amazing in a book directed to teenagers.. making it seem like ""everyones doing it"""
1,Trash,What trash and drivel this book is. It is a crime that this book is being marketed to children. Would that only reviewers were permitted to read this trash.
1,Too far.,Any responsible parent that would buy this trash for their children should not be suprised when their daughters are swinging on some pole at the local Scores! This pedophilia disguised as literature should be used as kindling!
1,rainbow party,This book serves no redeeming purpose whatsoever except to challenge the right to publish whatever one wants. I do believe in First Ammendment rights. The author initmates that parents need to know what is going on but this book truly glamorizes a practice that unfortunately is real. There are multiple web sites for parents to stay informed of such teen behavior. I think this book is totally counterproductive to the author's premise and I sincerely hope this genre goes quickly by the wayside.
1,Nothing close to what I expected.,"I was looking for a sort of fluff book to read and came across Rainbow Party. It hinted at some naughtiness but not overly abundantly so like Erotica, which is to much for me, so I picked it up.When first starting out this book I was thinking this book could go somewhere fun, if not a little raunchy. I was excited for just a little pleasure read. And so I read and kept reading and reading, waiting for it to come (the Rainbow Party)....and then I realized I'd read the whole book. And nothing, absolutely nothing happened. I came full circle and realized that this book was a big waste of time."
3,A PARENTS VIEW...I HAVE A 12 YEAR OLD SON...,"I would NOT want my 12 year old son to read this book. Not just because of the subject matter but also because I didn't find it very well written. The things they deal with in the book could be handled by some kids, but it all depends on their maturity level. My first impression was that it should be for maybe High School kids, but not for middle schoolers. I think it would just give them ideas to try sexual things that are described in the book. All I kept thinking while I was reading was that I do NOT think this should be allowed in school libraries. (which I have read that it is indeed in some school libraries)Overall, I didn't think the book was worth all the hype..but you decide!"
3,Starts off a bit slow but picks up.,"I did enjoy this book in the Chrestomanci chronicles. It took a bit to start up but it did well towards the end. The ending plot twists were quite fun but some of the bigger ones were a little rushed. I would have liked to see Conrad do a bit more in the end and see how his life goes on after that, but oh well. Still a good read."
5,"American History, Reviewed","I needed to buy this book for a History 132 class, but I actually enjoy it. It's not as dry a book as some that I've studied.If you're a student, I'm pretty sure you're not interested, but if you're a teacher, I'd recommend using this as the Curriculum"
3,Get (5 stars for the actual show),"a grip! Please release the full sets of these episodes! I bought the first box set hoping to complete the entire series only TO BE LEFT HANGING!5 stars for the show, Inspector Gadget, 1 star for the releases!!!!!Let's hope the full series comes out on dvd.... the wait has been too long!"
2,Factual but Ineffectual,"While the author presents many of the facts of Wittgenstein's visits to Ireland (many of them culled from Monk's bio), he makes little effort to DO anything with them. Wittgenstein's fascination with both Norway and Ireland as places of solitude for him to accomplish ""real work"" is a significant influence on his philosophy. It is a shame that a book of such promise fails to deliver. (But, as with the other review, still necessary for the completist)."
4,Essays On Science And History,"Cleopatra's Nose by Daniel Boorstin is a very good collection of forwards, introductions, lectures, and articles that Boorstin wrote in the '90s. The collection seems to be loosely held together by two themes: science in today's world thrives on the unexpected and discovering the limits of our knowledge [the more we know, the more we know that we don't know] and that the United States is a different kind of country and that's what makes it such a great country. If you are looking to read a book by Boorstin with one theme, then this is not the book for you. For those readers, I'd recommend The Discoverers, The Creators, and The Seekers. If you are a reader of essays or you are looking for smaller samples of Boorstin's writing, then this could be the book for you. I read it straight through, and despite the repetition of material between some of the essays, I found it to be a quick and thought provoking read."
1,The content of the book is the same as others,"May be I am too serious in this book.But tell the truth,the author justonly show his ""word game"" like someother authors.In his writing style,he never givesa consideration to his readers' readingability. What he want to do is to displayhow a great philologist he is.So when you buy the book you will get agood writing skill , not softwaretechnical skill."
2,Islam Jihad Revisionist,"1989 issue ISBN=0718828054; ISBN=018827791 for ""Revised edition 1990"" by Lutterworth Press (Cambridge, England) or Guernsey Press (Great Britain, Channel Is.)....first published in English 1989, reprinted in 1989, then Revised edition in 1990. Author: Hazrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad, who is listed as ""the supreme spiritual head of a dynamic missioonary sect, the Ahmadi Muslims."" He claims that the Quran (and thereby Islam) does not espouse any form of militant-jihad (except only in the ""defense"" of Islam). He condemns Islamic militant ""terrorism."" In reviewing Ayatollah Khomeini's ousting of the Shah of Iran (1980s CE), author Ahmad wrote: ""But when all is said and done...it certainly was not Islam which guided and instructed the Iranian revolution."" (p.106)"
4,An Excellent Arabian Horse Pedigree Resource,"The Kellogg Arabian Ranch was founded in 1925 and had a strong influence on Arabian horse breeding in North America throughout the 20th century. This book is an excellent resource for people researching the pedigrees of their horses with ancestors tracing to the Kellogg Institute, such as Ga'Zi, Abu Baha, Abu Farwa, and *Raseyn.There are many photographs throughout the book and individual sections on the prominent horses which include a discussion of their disposition, conformation, athletic ability, and their history. It also includes interesting tidbits such as two of the stallions were 5 gaited and there is a photograph of Rabiyas at the rack.There are some photographs of the early Crabbet horses such as Skowronek and Indian Magic."
2,Doesn't cut the mustard,"This book simply doesn't go into enough depth to pass the exam. I currently hold certifications from Microsoft, Sun, and Cisco. This is the first time I've ever failed a certification test. Didn't even come close to passing. This book gives you a good general overview of the topics covered on the exam. But it's just not enough."
5,Five Stars Aren't Enough!,"This is an awe inspiring recording.Dresden's brilliant Staatskapelle Orchestra plays its' heart out.The choirs are magnificent.And the soloists, in their nearly impossible vocal tasks, cover themselves with glory upon glory.Giuseppe Sinopoli was far from being my favorite conductor. However, it would be ridiculous to deny him his due here. His interpretation is, simply put, the best I've heard in 40 years.And the recorded sound? Unbelievable in it's clarity and power. The smallest detail can be heard, revealing heretofore unknown textures. Yet the mightiest climaxes are achieved with almost frightening force. The dynamic range is astounding.As I said, awe inspiring.If you are looking for the greatest performance of Shoenberg's monumental ""Gurrelieder"" ever committed to record, your search, in my humble opinion, is over.Case closed."
3,dissapointed,Received the CD Promptly but it was boxed wrong.Returned it to the seller and a credit was issued.I have reordered the same CD and hope I will receive the correct CD
5,"Humorous, Intelligent Satire expressed by the near future","Finally available in paperback, this book has attained a bit of cult status already. The extremely imaginative Matt Ruff has created a near future that is familiar, yet different enough to be disturbing, and definitely revealing of human depths not often explored in science fiction. The authors style and voice take a bit of getting used to, but are highly imaginative and do a good job of transporting the reader to another time and place. Highly recommended for those looking for a bit of a challenge and humor in their science fiction."
4,Weird and wonderful,"I'd never heard of this book when it was recommended for our book club. With the confusion of characters and sub-plots it took a while to get into, but was well worth the work. Ruff has created a wonderful, witty adventure of a novel - as it progressed and the storylines came together I had trouble putting it down.There are moments where his 'term paper'-style arguments with Ayn Rand de-rail the flow and grate a little, but his satire of American culture and all things 'politically correct' are entertaining enough to forgive him. Definitely recommend."
2,Save Your Money,"The instruction manual that comes with this VIBE player is worthless. I've written tecnical support twice and the reply always starts out ""using the VIBE is really quite simple""...if it were ""quite simple,"" I wouldn't have written to ask for help. I've had a techno-savy friends try to get this player to work with no luck. We can get the vocie recorder and radio to work without a problem but I can only get 2 out of 6 music files to play. I wish I had saved the money I spent on this and applied it to a more user friendly player"
4,Sultry and Dark with a touch of humor,"Sultry and dark with just enough humor to keep you interested, i liked this DVD a lot. Dark story of a detective which is really a vampire and his exploits..."
4,"Sad, happy? You Decide","I am not going to spoil the story, but I hope you least know the main character is a vampire.Anyways, I found this show very enjoyable to the extend if you are not in a bad mood when you watch it. I don't know what kind of story you usually like, but the story for this show usually ends up in a bitter sweet ending.With the price for 6 ep. per disc for 2 disc, this series can't go wrong."
2,Boring and slow,"Typical storyline of the beast in disguise, the little girl secretly in love, lurking evil plots... . Reasonable animation and dub but an overall slow and uninteresting storyline. Basically introduces a set of 2D characters and puts them into fight after fight leading toward a predictable climax. See BioHunter for a much better monster story or Buffy the Vampire Slayer for a better twist on the whole vampire genre."
4,"Good, but full of errors","Whilst the author has gone to great lengths to show various routing theories & their implementation, the number of errors is large. On just about every page there are simple spelling mistakes and missing information for the router configs.If you have the patience to work through the mistakes, it is a worthy reference."
3,Too many errors,"I purchased CCNP Practical Studies: Routing by Henry Bengamin.It contains way too many errors, and the errata is a joke.Cisco Press should be ashamed."
4,Works for me a good tech manual to break down routing.,"Having passed the CCNA Exam I naturally want to further my certification with the CCNP, I am currently studying the Routing exam and have several books. I found this book to be a nice addition to the material I already have.The book is 550 pages and the routing exam objectives are covered fully. The book has over 40 scenarios covering VLSM, routing basics, OSPF, IS-IS, EIGRP and BGP. The scenarios are not just walk through example you really need to think things out before beginning, a refreshing change.I also very much like the 1 14 hour study lab, as well as the review question at the end of each chapter. Each scenario has code examples to follow and learn by and again with the lab you really have to think about what you are doing be fore proceeding forward.One tiny drawback is that there was no simulator, so you have to have access to equipment. If you are in a formal training setting this should be no problem. Overall a very good book"
4,nostalgic,"i had this as a child 30ish years ago and my parents still onlybhad te life boat for some reason but, my daughter and her male friends had so much fun just playing with that part that i decided to buy the whole kit again. it's a nice gender-neutral item for my princess-obsessed daughter. she doesn't see ut as a boy toy, thankfully! but i may need to add a female doll to keep that sentiment alive...."
5,Well worth stealing (?),"Well where do I possibly begin... I am the sister of the previous reviewer and I am smugly proud to have discovered this fantastic book. I can't remember how many times I have read it, but everytime I get something else from it. It still haunts my dreams just like we were told that it would, and I go days thinking about it.As my brother has said, please, please if there is to be a film version, be kind to it as there is nothing so devestating to find that all your hopes and fantasies have been crushed amidst the shag pile!!An excellent read and one that will stay with me forever."
4,Pure Brain Candy,"Somehow I found a copy of this book sitting on my parent's coffee table. I picked it up and read it at the tender age of 13. I have never let it leave my side since. This book is pure brain candy. The storyline is absolutely thrilling, the characters are well thought out, and the suspense is incredible. I certainly wouldn't call it ""modern literature"" but it rates in the same category as ""Bright Lights Big City"" and ""Story of My Life""."
1,magazine,"have not received it. My son-in-law was supposed to receive it for christmas. Perhaps Cowboys and Indians might call me. My mother sent this to my son-in-law for years, and I picked up the subscription for him when she passed. I am hoping it will come to him."
2,Here we go again.,"You almost feel sorry for the author. Draped in acclaim, among the books of the year, it can only mean that any reader approaches this book with high expectations. More worrying, the author's information on the back of the book talks mosly about all the prizes he won at Harvard. And that's what the book feels like, a very well executed assignment. It's written in a fairly convincing pidgin English, but when it wavers, it breaks the rhythm and the belief. It also feels entirely formulaic. It goes through the trials of dehumanisation (murder, rape, sodomy etc) but it never engages the reader's sympathy, just occasional admiration. There's no doubt that Iweala can write. I hope he dares to produce something fresh that doesn't feel borrowed from another culture, another life. I'd risk buying another book of his."
4,Bravo,"Grant it this movie starts out slowly. You start to wonder whether it was best left on the shelf and then..... Then she goes to England and your laughing for the rest of the movie. Well done Kathy Bates, Rupart Everett and extra points to Meredith Eaton.... Anyone not liking this movie lacks a sense of humor..."
4,Unconditional Love,This movie is such an unexpected pleasure. It's a comedy and so much more. It's a wonderful story and the characters are unusual and maybe that's what makes it so good. Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett are such great actors and these parts are perfect for them. It's definitely a feel good movie.
5,Well I had never heard of this GEM!!!,"Read the other good reviews - this is a splendid, dark, clever and wonderful comedy. Just as a by the way - I thought four weddings and a funeral was awful - but this made up for that lapse!"
5,Another Kathy Bates Gem of a Movie!,"This is a great movie - I wish I would have heard of it sooner. If you're a Kathy Bates fan, it's a must have. The movie shows us how life has alot of unpredictable twists and turns and how the influences of just a few people in your life can take you to new places - literally and otherwise - as with taking a person out of their comfort zone to where they end up living life out loud more. This movie is funny, touching, will make you laugh and most definitely entertain you with unexpected events. Some great cameo appearances by a couple of big stars. Check it out - it's a keeper that I'll definitely be watching again."
4,"Great tool, tough to control","This is a great tool....once you learn how to control it. I highly recomend you take a scrap board, draw lines all over it and practice tracing the lines with the tool. It'll take time. Other than that, very easy to change bits and seems durable. Wear ear protection. LOUD!"
2,Skip to the half way mark.,"Like most late 70's/early 80's slashers, ""Silent Scream"" starts off with an hour of actors in their 30's pretending to be teenagers who get drunk and sleep together to kick off the body count. But unlike pretty much every other film in the genre, the second half actually has some story to it, and turns out to be a fairly fun low-budget camp homage to Psycho that isn't just Psycho again. If that sounds like your cup of tea, then here's 45-minutes worth of cheap entertainment for the next time you have the flu."
3,Walk - somewhat informative,"I rented this becauase I am a hiker and do long distance day-hikes, triathlons and running races. I've read other books about the PCT and wanted to see footage. This served the purpose of informing me further about what this is like, but moreover who you may meet out there."
3,Couldn't see a difference,"Some have mentioned a smell to this soap. I either got used to it or it wasn't so bad. Hubby didn't complain anyway. It's somewhat of a pleasant scent. I have to say, the bar did not last long. I figure for what I paid for it I would have liked for it to have lasted longer. Also I really didn't notice a difference in my skin. I don't think it was worth the purchase."
1,missing parts,i was missing parts on all 30 rotisseries. i cant get anyone from customer service at amazon to send me the missing unless i ship them all back. i will never buy again.
5,set it and forget it?,I forgot it so much that it's been unused for months. But if you want the best roast chicken........yummy!
2,ronco rotisserie,"This machine can do a fair job,but it has big drawbacks: 1) difficult to set up 2) heat is not trapped so it heats up the kitchen greatly 3)By the time it is set up, food planned could be better cooked in an oven 4) difficult to clean properly 5) messy and dangerous 6) I no longer use this thing and feel cheated"
1,doesn't fit,"Amazon's 'Find parts that fit' feature said this would fit my 1971 Standard Beetle. However, upon receipt and eventual attempt to install, the upper bell housing of the shocks are too big and hit the vehicle's a-arm making them not usable on my carMonroe MA803 Max-Air Air Shock Absorber"
1,No hole to button pants!!!,"Not a flex waist pant, had no hole to button them! Looks like knock off dickies, terrible, about to return them so we""ll see how that goes"
3,Dumb too short Side Pocket,Bought these pants all excited to be able to put my cell phone in the extra side pocket. The pocket snaps shut which would be awesome to keep the phone safe and in place. The problem is the pocket is so short an iPhone or I assume any other normal common touch screen phone will not fit in there. This made the whole good concept fail. How stupid!
2,"Very overpriced, especially without the fork","This product arrived without the fork or any signs that there had ever been a fork attached to the product. The seller also failed to note it was shipping in a cool pack box--apparently it needs refrigeration. I ordered it for an APO address, and someone should have noticed and contacted me or noted the perishability of the product in the advertizement."
5,Ariadne auf Naxos a Treasure,This is a recording of a studio performance of Ariadne auf Naxos in concert - not a fully staged opera. This format worked fine for me because this 40 year old version boasts a superb cast that would be hard to equal today. Beverly Sills' spectacular coloratura singing the role of Zerbinetta represents the great American diva at her peak and a performance that should prove a real peak to any opera fan who hears it.
4,Disney's Tower of Terror,"We purchased this movie for a Halloween ""Family"" movie night which had kids of all ages. It had a good story & actors and it wasn't to scary for the real young children. I would recommend it especially for youngsters."
3,"Made for TV feel, but Kids LOVE it!","I have been eyeing this movie for sometime, but was turned off because it was a direct to video movie. I went ahead and took advantage from a discounted price here on Amazon and bought it for the Halloween season. My son (10) would give this movie 5 stars - EASY. He LOVED this movie. He had a friend come over and they watched and now his friends want the movie. It's a kid friendly movie as you would expect from Disney and there is NOTHING that is racy or profane. Younger viewers will like it as well.For adults, the movie is ""O-kay"", but it kept my interest. There was an interesting plot twist that I was not expecting, so that bumped this movie up a couple of notches for me. Anyway, if you are looking for a good, fun family flick for the Halloween season, this is a good one."
5,WOW!,"This is one of the BEST Stompboxes I have ever used!Forget every Wah Pedal, 'cause you can do some really impossible things!Not like the Heil Talkbox or the Framtone Talkbox, the Rocktron is Active wich means you can use it like a Stompbox and you don't have to plug it between your amp and your Cab!With a little bit of practice and training you will be able to change your Guitar/Keyboard sound by 100%!!!!"
3,"Great stage production, shoddy tape production.","If this was just about the Stratford production, I'd have put 5 stars, no hesitation--it's a joy to watch. But the box doesn't even tell you it's Len Cariou as Petruchio. On top of that, the tapes are reproduced at EP/SLP, and they *still* use two tapes for a roughly three hour presentation!! If you can't stand not owning this, go ahead and blow the money, but otherwise wait until a better quality tape or DVD comes out. Same goes for the other tapes in the collection."
2,"I'm sorry, what did you say?","If I had bought this for anything less than study purposes, I would be disappointed. The sound, camera work and video quality are so bad that it is hard to judge the quality of the production."
2,It could be better,Wicca Candle Magick is a book for those interested in beggining pratices. I don't really highly reccomend this book to much but it is a good book to have just for the correspondence charts. Some of the things included in this book deals with too mundane matter to even consider.
1,Inane ramblings,"Greene just can't seem to get to the point. Any point. But she does take a long time not getting there. More than any author I have encountered, Greene seems to think that one should never use one or two words when a dozen or two will do the same job. I spent more time rereading Greene's sentences than any other book I can remember with little to show for it. Apparently, Greene feels that filling her book with long rambling quotes, endless lists of examples, arcane terminology, unnecessary adjectives, and run on sentences gives it some gravitas. While it does make it difficult to understand, that doesn't mean that the underlying ideas are deep, just that they are obscured by poor writing."
2,Certainly not Brecht,"I've seen the movie version of this, one of the best scores and scripts created in the ""musical theatre genre."" While Lotte Lenya and the supporting cast are very good, this version is hardly true to Brecht or his style. Apparently Brecht did not understand that by selling the screen rights to the script, he was also giving the producers liscence to do whatever the wanted with it - and he had no power over it. The endind is notably changed from any translation you are likely to find in print, and few of the best songs remain - as a matter of fact, i recall only about four or five songs in the film verison. Mr. And Mrs. Peachum, while wonderfully portrayed, are far from the middle-class underlords we love them to be - they were a mismatched pair, Mrs. Peachum in a fabulous dress, and drop earings, and Peachum looking like one of his beggars. A interesting note, though: MacHeath's gang are adorable, fun and very will played!"
1,it stings my eyes,"I tried this at least 10 times before I just gave up on it, it's awful. It has a pleasant feel on the skin and it feels hydrating, but if you put it to close to the eye it stings. Which is ridiculous, because it's an eye cream. So I tried not to get it too close the next times I used it...this cream migrates and every time I end up tearing up and crying because it stings soooo much.....So no thank you."
5,Amazing,"Hot Yuna's Spalshdown Two is a great album. I reccomend it for anyone lookin' to hear some good jammin' hot tuna. If you like this c.d. i would also reccomend you look at some of Hot Tuna's other good albums such as ""Burgers"" and ""First Pull Up Then Pull Down""."
4,little town of strathmore,"my niece, lee ann moses was an extra in this film at the high school scene. i did not watch this movie until i moved back here from idaho 12 years later. but after i watched it, i was highly impressed. the film stuck in my head. it has a very good meaning. as soon as i watched this film i saw the lady actress in alot of movies. who knew? lol. but who is the guy? he's cute but where is he? why did don most pick my town i wonder. well im glad he did. it put us on the map once again. see this movie. you'll never forget it. thanks don."
3,Opposites,"Simple, 'opposite' words in both languages; Good, Colorful; though more appropriate for a younger child than the 7 year old age range we searched for."
3,Thought it would be a miracle cure.....,"With the claims people make about this product, I thought it would help my terrible episodes of angioedemas (deep hives).It didn't. Nothing helps except sticking to an anti-hive diet."
4,Lycia does it again...,"After the departure of sideman instrumentalist David Galas, who contributed significantly to their previous two albums _Cold_ and _The Burning Circle And Then Dust_, Lycia are now just Mike and Tara. Tara has taken up some of the slack, although not in the same capacity; her swooning, blissful lyrics and vocals lead more than half of the songs, up from 3 on _Cold_ and just 2 on _Burning Circle_. They also demonstrate an increased stylistic range and clarity, as on the Dead Can Dance-ish ""Tongues"" and stark ""El Diablo"". Meanwhile, Mike returns with his bare, unique single-string guitar parts, thoughtful instrumentals (""Clouds In The Southern Sky"", ""Distant Fading Star""), and haunting, whispered vocals, as well as bringing back the simpler rhythmic forms of the earliest Lycia material. All in all, enrapturing and very satisfying, as only Lycia can be. Count yourself lucky, as I do, if you know and love them."
1,Not sharp enough,"This blade is not sharp enough for my beard, especially on the reverse pull, it sticks and rips the roots. I will try the Derby and if that does not work then Feather."
5,Only razors my hubby uses,My husband has a safety razor and has always used these blades. They are not too expensive for how long they last and the shipping was fast from the company that sold them. I wouldn't recommend any other brand... these are the best.
1,Sliced my face up,"These razors sliced my head and my face up. I had month long shaving irritation and razor burn from these things. My neck and head got cut up. Your milage may vary. If you have soft facial fair then by all means use these razors. My facial hair is thick, coarse man hair. If you have my type of hair use the feather razors."
5,Perfect,I purchased these to fit a razor I bought for my husband from The Art Of Shaving. At the store the blades were $12. They are the exact same thing except they didn't come in the plastic packaging for just $5. Will always buy them here.
4,Great costume!,"Would have given the costume 5 stars but it was too long for me at 5'4"" and since it was just a costume I didn't want to pay to have it altered."
1,Changed rating to 5 stars,"This is written by a part time gamer who simply likes to enjoy a game. I find most games are far too difficult for the part time gamer even on the easy setting. All games should have a ""Very Easy"" option. I suspect that there are many others like me who would buy more games if they were not so difficult.The game was fine until Act 3 and then it became unplayable for me because it was too difficult. I thought the rest of the game was great. Because this was frustrating rather than fun I give it a 1 star. If they had a Very Easy selection so that I could actually play the game I would have given it 5 stars..I bought the Guide from Amazon and it helped a lot. I would now rate it 5 stars but Amazon does not seem to allow me to change my rating."
5,Love This Game!!!,"This game is great! I've been playing it for three weeks straight now. Your job is to command an army and fight. What more can you ask? Graphics are plain but they should be as you don't want anything distracting you from the battle. If you liked playing Risk as a kid, you will love this game. It's all about strategy to win!"
3,Epic?,"Since it is the first Epic to come to us from the Middle East, I have to say not that bad. We don't really know how it ends since that has been lost to time, but the story up to there is well, epic. Full of stange names and places Gilgamesh goes on a quest to find himself and ultimately finds a freind. To bad the friend dies, so it would seem that Gilgamesh is the first epic tragedy. The real tragedy is we don't know how it ends, unless somebody uncovers some cunieform tables with the ending.So, is it epic? In a word, yes."
4,Thought provoking book,"""Leah's Way"" is a well written book that helps you have empathy for all those homeless people you see (or don't want to see) on city streets. It's a compelling story of every person's dignity and worth, no matter how depressed, filthy, sick and hopeless they appear. It is also a wonderful parable of how one woman hangs on to her faith in God even though she has lost everything else and how that faith in a loving God is the most important possession anyone could have. I was also thinking of how the book shows that one must choose to love others and let go of past abuse and disappointments if one is to truly live."
5,inside the propaganda,"I loved this book. Uri writes what is basically a list of ""short stories"", each a well referenced expose on a corrupt, illegal, manipulative government. It is hard for me to read the depressing truth and I enjoy reading it in a concise, clear chapter at a time. The subjects are diverse and each was enlightening, thank you, Mr. dowbenko. The last chapter on Reptilian agenda is leading me to read David Icke's ""Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center"" which I highly recommend also."
3,too big!,I ordered this pendant to go with a similar cube earrings I bouth from the same seller. I was very surprised when I saw the size of it - it's huge! This means it's not elegant at all and goes mainly with casual outfits. I was hoping it would be more discreet.
1,do not buy and waste your time returning this to the store,"We were all excited about this toy--yes i had my doubts. Always listen to that inner voice. We charged it the first time for 4 hours and lasted 20 minutes, then afterwards it loses its suction power and BANG onto my hardwood floors to nick away...it does not drive on carpets very well at all. The only thing good is that it does not leave any marks on the wall. Anyway, now that we have recharged it it does not want to work correctly at all...waste of money going to return it tomorrow.."
1,Dissappointing,"This is a very dissappointing toy. Yes it does climb walls and that part was very fun to my son but the charge on the battery lasted 15 minutes at best then had to be charged overnight to get the full 15 minutes of use again. After a couple times of that, he lost interest. The bottom side ripped very easy and it was only used on carpet."
2,Switch (Bluff),"Great movie- but the quality is unbelievably poor, hardly watchable. It is available in DVD quality in Italian, but without subtitles. This DVD looks more like a VHS-rip, only quality is simply dreadful"
3,Nothing Demystified About This Book,I found without an intensive mathematics background Introduction to Quantum Mechanics (2nd Edition) by David J. Griffiths to be a more productive read. The mathematics are more clearly laid out in DeMystified but concepts are not explained and there are few definitions to be found.
3,Great tour guide,"I bought this book thinking it would be more of a coffee table book, fully of glossy pages of photos. It is not that. It is a book that is useful if you plan to visit the South, as it gives detail into addresses, times and admission prices of old plantations. The pages are not glossy, nor in colour. More like an oversized novel."
2,So so,These cards arrived fast but they were very old. My son was very disappointed and expected at least one good card. not worth the money
2,Largely dissapointing,"This could have been excellent, and does in fact include many very nice, albeit tasteful, photos of the Corrs. They are all related, three sisters and one brother. I have always been impressed that a group of siblings could stand each other and are able to keep a group together without constant arguing. Even more interesting, I expected to find out more about what goes on behind closed doors with these people, particularly in the dressing room they share while on tour. But there is a lot of good nuts'n'bolts information about the workings of this talented band."
4,A Woman on Her Own,"To gain continuity in this series, reading them in order is besT. Dame Frevisse is visiting London on a mission for her cousin, Lady Alice. A city in the verge of rebellion is not where she wants to be, but duty to her convent is the first order of business.THE SEMPSTER'S TALE explores two themes of medieval England that are ignored in the history books. A woman on her own with her own business and the fate of Jews who are in England after they have been outlawed and exiled for over one hundred years.A good read at anytime.Nash Black, SANDPRINTS OF DEATH"
5,Frazer's back on target!,"I've been disappointed in the past couple of Margaret Frazer's Dame Frevisse novels, as they felt almost like the author was tired of her character. Not this one, though! I meant to sit down this afternoon and read for about 30 minutes; I ended up by reading all afternoon and finishing the book because I couldn't put it down! Frazer's back to her old form with an excellent, well-told story and a fascinating depiction of life in medievel London. I can't wait for the next one!"
3,"Five Stars for Trimmer, 1 Star For Amazon.com","Bought this attachment for my Mantis and it works great. The problem is with Amazon. I bought it for around ninety dollars, then the price dropped to under sixty dollars. Up until their unpublicized policy change in September, you could request the difference in price credited back to you if the purchase was less than 30 days before price drop. I guess I bought mine after the deadline, as I requested a credit for the price difference and was denied stating their new policy. Since I now have no recourse if a better price is advertised,I have been more hesitant buying products from Amazon since the policy change."
2,Ick,Read J.R.R. Tolkiens The Simillarion if you want a way cooler history of the Elves & other fantasy races. This book is kinda wimpy. The editor must of had the day off because the writing goes on and on and is a rehash from previous sections of the book. The basic design/typeography/illustrations are below meager for a rich fantasy book.The illustrations are not that good. WOTC got a sweet deal by hiring cheap illustrators to push this book out the print shop.
5,Drop Dead Diva season 4,"Drop Dead Diva Season 4 was really very exciting. The season made you feel all of the different emotions. Sad, mad, glad, the episodes were filled with laughter but also tears, definitely an emotional ride."
4,Great except For...........,"I think Brooke Elliott is fantastic as Jane, April Bowlby is a wonderful natural comedian, Kate Levering is perfect for the role, Jackson Hurst is compelling as Grayson, and Josh Stamberg great as Parker, and the icing on the cake is Owen. He's perfect for Jane.I've been watching Drop Dead Diva since it began and have enjoyed it immensely. However their casting agent needs to retire and hire someone with more class. With the choices of grade C guest actors such as Rose O'Donnell, Paula Abdul (whom I do like), Kim Kardashian, and in last nights preview clip,the Good Ole Southern Backwoods Bottom Feeder, Nancy Grace, leads one to think, Good God, who's in charge of the casting? Howard Stern? This show stands on it's own without bringing in weak talent to keep viewers interest. And Jane needs some new colors to wear. She may be round, but she would look beautiful in white and other softer colors."
2,Didn't like the ending.,"dead jane comes back in owen's body!? The worst ending someone could think of. Why didn't she come back as someone else? Did they REALLY have to KILL owen.. men.. he was so great the least you can do if you're gonna kill him is a freaking sad episode! I hope they bring him back. Can't Fred and Luke do something about it? 2 angels and no one can do a freaking thing? Can't believe they killed the best guy in the show to bring back lame jane to ""fight for a life"" that she didn't live or enjoy anyway!"
5,Love this show,Never heard of this show until about a month ago. I've now watched almost all the old episodes. I'm hooked. Can't wait for a new season to start.
4,"I didn't know all the songs, and those I didn't quite like.",Just need to listen to more samples of songs when i can. That would help me for more future purchases.
3,Pedometer w/Alarm,"I liked the sound of the alarm and the way it clips on your pants, but it was smaller than I thought it would be and the screen was hard to see without wearing glasses."
4,Isle of Woman,The book is a first edition and arrived in good condition.The content of the book is not living up to its hype
5,Mans History In Motion,"Piers Anthonys depiction of life evolution is a great example of his dedication to the entertainment of his readers. As an avid fan I have read almost all of his novels. And I do mean novels! Mr. Anthony has an uncanny ability to draw his readers into the worlds he creates. The emotions and reactions I felt were as if I were there in real life. This series is a wonderful example of Mr. Anthonys ability to draw a reader in and make them feel the emotions and thoughts of his charaters. Overall, a very exceptional book that I highly enjoyed reading!"
4,great fun,"Only Voltaire could lend songs about failed relationships, serial killers, and fallen angels such charm. The ""sardonic wit"" might be applied a little too thickly sometimes, and the lyrics are consequently clumsy and unsubtle, but great fun. The strings add a surreal ""old-world"" feel to the songs; less the devil's bris, and more like his bar-mitzvah.Voltaire might not appeal to everyone -- especially to the more unhumorous and dogmatic, but I encourage everyone else to have a listen. And see him live if you can -- he's tons of fun."
3,It's ok I guess,"The flavor is nice, it's like brushing your teeth with an orange Tic-Tac. However, the freshness wears off fast, my teeth don't feel clean, and I end up craving oranges. For people who don't like harsh, minty toothpastes this is probably better for them, I'll stick to A&H baking soda toothpastes."
2,Meh,"Got it for a book club, couldn't get through it. Super complicated plot line and old fashioned writing. Not my thing."
1,Fortified candy,"guys come on, all the reviews talk about how yummy the bar is...so what? Have you checked the nutrition label? You may as well be eating a cookie and popping a multivitaminevery bar has 23g (92 Calories) of sugar compared to 10g of protein! D-:i know it is an ""energy"" bar, but why is the energy coming from sugar??the only reason i see for buying this is if you want to replace junk food, like chips and cookies. This is definately a better choice. But a terrible choice if you are looking to get in shape.@ SeanboyObviously you don't understand the concept of HEALTHY DIETFilling up on sugar is not the way to go, but surely you lack the capacity to comprehend this simple concept"
2,"Needs more breakdancing, believe it or not.","We ordered this hoping to see a lot of breakdancing. Instead, it was so many different clips jumping around, that it didn't feel like you got to just watch one person dance for even 1/10 a song. Some of the video was almost too dark to even see the dancers. The moves they showed were great, there just weren't enough easy-to-watch breakdancers doing some breakdancing! More breakdancing next time, please!"
2,disappointing,Wild Steps to Heaven was a real disappointment. I read Rain of Gold and Thirteen Senses and enjoyed the stories about the family and their hardships in making a life for themselves in a different society. The characters were well drawn. I couldn't help fall in love with every single one of them.Wild Steps to Heaven goes back to the time when little Lupe wasn't born yet. Much was a rehash what already had been told in the other two books. But what really disappointed me was the poor characterization of the Villasenor children. It was very superficial. The dialogue was not persistent with the way of life in this poor mountainous area. I didn't even feel the desire to finish the book.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK ----- LETTER TOO SMALL TO READ!,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK ----- LETTER TOO SMALL TO READ!All book letter size is like disclaimers...letter size is 4 or 5
3,Compressor had little use and leaks air badly,"When I first got this compressor I really liked it. But after the warranty ran out it developed a bad air leak. I really hadn't used it much. If I had to guess I'd say it has less than 10 hours run time.UPDATE: the air was leaking through the check valve causing air to flow from the tank back to the compressor. A few light taps on the check valve unstuck the valve, and it's working fine now.I've revised my rating from one star to three stars."
3,Columnist not novelist,"Articles made short & sweet (or sour), quirky interest every week written by a columnist for the New York Observer. These in turn were collected & became a book sold in the women's cultural study, non-fiction section of the bookstore. One can see where the characters for the TV show were created but Sex & the City is not a novel, no thought out flowing plot, only the weekly articles Bushnell created for the amusement of New Yorkers about the how the other half lives. It's not that raunchy, not that pretty, it's pretty sad actually (for the people she writes about). The style is that of a columnist not a novelist, so don't expect the TV show only the basic elements for the show lie hidden within…"
2,Cynical as hell...be sure you know what you're buying,"Despite the several warnings in reviews here about confusing the book with the HBO series, it's easy to confuse the two. After all, the typeface and star of the series is featured on the book's cover. Be aware, though, that the book is nothing like the series. The tone, like Bushnell's other fiction, is bitter and empty. The female characters have shallow lives--they are desperate to get or keep their looks, status, or money by any means possible. The friendships which are fundamental to the series are not part of this world. The male characters are no more interesting or realistic. Bushnell can write, but her characters are unrecognizable to me (thank God!) and her cynical point of view makes you feel sorry for her rather than feeling a connection."
3,Divas of Decadence!!!!,"Most women I know can't really relate to the pretentiousness of the women found between the pages of this book, but boy do they find them interesting! These ""characters"" are not so much entertaining as they are enthralling. Due to the scattershot scenes of romantic quandaries, the book lacks the sense of cohesion that more traditional fiction gives. However, thanks to the success of the TV show, following the misadventures of Carrie and her girlfriends is a labor of love for the already loyal SEX AND THE CITIzens. This is what Jackie Collins or Danielle Steele would be writing if they were trying to be ultra hip! A sensational representation of today's current state of romantic dysfunction."
2,What's the point?,"Like other customer reviewers, I bought the book because I enjoy the HBO series. It's amazing that someone read this, though, and thought it would work on screen, because the book is exceptionally slight. No character development, no plot, and no real content. At least it was a fast read."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"Very Very dissapointing, I am in love with the series on HBO, so I figured I would equally enjoy the book, but was very dissapointed when I began to read. It is not written in novel format, it is a series of short articles ranging from 1/2 page to 3-4 pages, not in any sort of particular order. Not at all like the short stories in the series. Did not hold my interest for more than 5 pages, I have forced myself to read more, but it is definatley a book most could do without."
2,Book is to show what fast food is to haute cuisine,"On the show, the characters are well developed and multifaceted. They are good friends, and Carrie (the main character) is likeable and generally admirable. If she were a real person, I'd want her as a friend.In the book, the characters are only sketched. They are merely acquaintances. Carrie is a spoiled brat. If she were a real person, I'd avoid her!I finished reading the book only because I was on the treadmill at the gym with no other entertainment options. But I LOVE the series! That is, I love what I have seen of the series -- the first season, which is on video. I don't have HBO. I eagerly await the next season's videos!"
1,the city,"I don't understand it. The TV series is brilliant and i'm sure in effect that Bushnell can write but clearly her ideas come across better when acted out. It's a shame really, it could be a great book only everthing is all over the place and just doesn't flow. Personally i'd stick to the TV series unless you want to be disappointed"
5,This is Manhattan,"I highly reccomend reading SEX AND THE CITY written by Candace Bushnell. It's smart, intelligent, sexy, funny, unapologetic, facinating, all this and more. The book takes a look at life in Manhattan. I found it very amusing to read, from the menage a trois to the bicycle boys. There is much irony such as the four city woman going to visit the married women in Conneticut for a baby shower. The book follows many characters, and their relationships throughout the course of this book. The main character being Carrie, and following her tumultuous relationship with Mr. Big. She wonders if she will ever get married, have children. The book analyzes the different aspects of life for a woman in Manhattan. The characters are outrageous and it's very to get into their world through reading this. A good book about relationships between people. If you enjoy the HBO series you are sure to like this, it's even more explicit than the series is! Overall a good read, highly reccomended."
2,"Candace should be thanking Parker, Catrall, Davis and Nixon","... for making her a best-selling author, because she couldn't do it on this drivel alone.Yes, there were moments of genuine entertainment in the book. But I don't know if it's my Midwestern sensibility or my ""fashionista"" membership expiring, but I found the book to be snobbish and shallow.In other books exploring the fab lives of the girls in Manhattan, I got a voyueristic thrill reading about their exploits at work, shopping, at the clubs, and in bed. The HBO series fufilled those same joys.But reading SITC I was annoyed and dismissive of the characters little problems made into molehills, a la NYC neurosis. That kind of behavior is forgivable in teenagers, where every pimple is a crisis. It is less forgivable of 35 year olds hung over trailing mink coats on private jets."
1,It was disappointing,"I don't understand why this author is writing prequel books about Carrie Bradshaw that don't match with this book. This book claims her mother is still alive while she is living in New York, but in The Carrie Diaries it claimed her mother died while she was a child. Doesn't't make any sense."
1,Dumber than the TV show,"Who ever wrote the screenplay for the HBO series was far more gifted as a storyteller than this author. I downloaded it as a vacation read for some mindless entertainment and it wasn't either. Do yourself a favor, skip this and watch the series on Netflix."
1,The show is soooo much better!,I was very disappointed when I read this book. I had already seen a couple of the seasons of the TV show and was hoping to get an idea of how it got started. This author is awful! Her writing just doesn't flow well and it's not as engaging as the book. Don't waste your time.
2,Good thing someone else writes the scripts for the show!!,"I love Sex and the City, the show that is, the book is another matter entirely. I know the series is ""loosely"" based on the novel which is just as well. If it was written like this poor excuse for a book it would have been cancelled after it's pilot episode. The show is ripe with raunch and wit, along with characters we truly care about. This book is grim and dark, poorly written, and ripe with people I would never want to meet. What we have here is a rare example of the show being far better than the book. I never thought I would advocate TV over the written word, but in this case, turn on HBO."
2,Not at all like the series.....,"After reading previous reviews, I was not expecting a novelization of the series. The book was the ionspiration for the series, after all. Nothing translates to TV in the same way. But I have to say that while the writing itself was excellent, I was disappointed. The characters were extremely shallow, and not as well developed. You can see where the story lines for the first season of the series came from, even some quotes line for line, but that's the only connection between the two. This book lacks the hope the series gave. You don't like any of the characters when you finish, and don't care one or another if they live or die or ever get married or whatever. Maybe that was Ms. Bushnell's plan, but I really didn't care for it. There is nothing loveable about this book."
3,Fun,"What most people say about this book is true. The style of writing is not very good. I definitely enjoy ""Sex and The City"" on DVD than this book. However, it was fun to read. I gave it 3 stars because of that. There are better books out there, but if you're a ""Sex and the City"" fan, go ahead and read it. Just don't have a lot of high expectations."
3,Very different from TV series,"Very different from TV series, so not exactly what I was expecting. A little on the angry, cynical side but still entertaining reading for the most part."
1,Simply awful.,I don't know how Candace Bushnell ever got her own column. Skip the book and stick with the show.
5,The only book to tell the truth about love in Manhattan.,I am honored to be Candace Bushnell's editor and this book is a mere sliver of the treasures packed into her size 4 dress.
1,Disapointing,"Well I recently got hooked on the show and thought the book would be good. Its okay, kinda interesting to see where some of the stories for the show came from, but hard to read, poorly written and really hard to get into. Sorry Candace but I don't see how you made a living being a writer. I'm glad you don't write for the HBO show."
1,Stick to the HBO series,"Yes, I read this book after becoming addicted to the HBO series. But this book is not nearly as interesting as the show. Very disappointing! The show is so witty and interesting, but the book is lacking something..."
1,This book has missed the boat,Candace Bushnell should be thanking the writers of the TV series because this book is horrible and a waste of time. I always saw it at the bookstore and thought I would read it.I wish I would of just keep walking passed it. She was trying to hard to make it edgy and dark but it just came out as poorly executed.Don't waste your time reading this just watch the TV series. This is like a bad accessory you can't wait to take off.
2,Disappointed too....,The olive oil just runs all the time after use of this product. I have to keep it in a little bowl so that the oil doesn't get all over the counter.
5,Great,"very good quality, no complaints, easy to adjust, holds cymbals well, works well with Pearl holders for my Pearl rack"
2,not worth it,"I've been using Murad products for about a year now and find them to be very effective in repairing my skin. I'm 52 years old and have the usual -- some age spots, a few surface wrinkles, large pores, and loss of elasticity and, of course, redness). Their redness therapy isn't as luxurious and I don't notice any change in the redness in my face. Save your money."
3,"About average, it works ok.","Nothing special here, it does what we wanted from it but there look to be cheaper solutions that are of equal quality I'd recommend looking at next time."
5,Monroe did it again!,"These monroe max-air air shock absorbers are the perfect answer I needed to complete my rear ride height, I lowered 3"" a blazer ls, with these air shocks I can maintain 35-40psi up to 90psi for extreme loads, when loaded I seem to dip a little, NOT NO MORE these monroe air shocks mounted up in approximately 30 minutes with proper tools and routing of lines, they are excellent! All parts were exact to fit."
1,Terrible from beginning to end,"This has to be one of the worst directed, acted and story lines i've ever seen, gay themed or not. It starts with a guy driving a subcompact car (they couldn't even find a pick-up?) in the middle of nowhere in the desert and suddenly out of nowhere male hustlers just appear. Speaking of nowhere, that's exactly where this horrible movie goes. I normally suggest renting a movie before buying it but I wouldn't even bother renting this bomb. The lead character offers a little eye candy but even that gets old after the first ten minutes."
1,There are no words to tell...,"how stupid is this film!!!!!!! I admire the guy who watched it till the end and wrote the long review.I just couldn't. I kept pressing ""forward"" button.The story (is there one?) must have been written by a drug addict on huuuuuuge high. How anybody sane could create such dumb thing?Acting is limited to the very limits and so is the action - but I think this won't surprise you.Some of the scenes (like the one at the beginning with all the ""cowboy"" hustlers) made me laugh really loud!!!And the BIG gun he carried in his jeans - HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA.If you look for hot bodies and steamy action, I will spare your time and money. The sex scenes are as hot as sibierian winters :)"
4,"Mad Men, Sweet Package","The oddest television series of the last decade is actually better on DVD because you can take your time, pause and replay, enjoy the ambience and 60's cachet. A series that is written, acted and dressed in 1960 may not be everyone's cup of tea. But if you let yourself be transported back to that time, you'll enjoy this show tremendously. The characters are written with enough complexity to keep you interested, especially key mad man Don Draper, played with disturbing confidence by Jon Hamm. His enigmatic character touches the dark side in all of us, that little corner where secrets are kept and new realities are woven to accomodate them. Toss in institutionalized sexism, the relentless smoking of cigarettes and a sense of entitlement nurtured by television and you've got an edgy, completely original series that's deliciously dark and dangerous. Video quality is crackling clean. The 5.1 audio is subtle and there when you want it."
3,No good DVD extras,"I was sort of hoping, since they made us wait nearly a year to release the DVD, that there would be some cool extras. The only thing on there of note is the ""making of Mad Men"" - c'mon. I love this show - couldn't you be a bit more creative - maybe interviews with the actors, stock footage of 1960s era original advertising, easter eggs, blooper reel, screen tests - all the other goodies you expect to get in addition to the episodes.This shouldn't be construed as a knock at the show itself - which is picture perfect - but if you are going to sit on a DVD release for 10 months at least make it worth the wait. I expect more from Season 2 DVD box Lionsgate / Weiner."
2,enjoyed the show,"decided to watch after several seasons of emmy awards. More importantly, I have adjusted to the grim reminders of how it was for women (me) in my early adult careers;However, I paid for 1st season and only got 1st episode.... way too expensive to continue. Good thing my library loans it for free!"
3,I Don't Get It!,"I recently watched all of the first season due to all the Emmy hype that is out. I was very disappointed and a little confused on why this is considered ""great"". Don't get me wrong, it was interesting enough for me to watch all the episodes and tune in for the very disappointing Season 2 opener, but it was nothing outstanding to me. I loved some dramas that were out like Dexter, The Tudors, etc. and thought the acting in them were Emmy material, but not Mad Men. It's boring, slow, dull, but still for some reaons a little intriguing. I guess what I really don't like is that you really never get to know the personality of certain characters. Betty, for instance, is prim & proper one moment, and letting strange men in the house the next minute, and then out shooting neighbors pigeons the next. I think a lot of the hype deals with the fact that it's set in a time period a lot of people (especially white males) would like to go back to. Personally, it's kind of scary in my opinion."
2,"WOW, THIS SHOW IS.....pretty mediocre","About 2.3 stars for this. A few episodes in the middle (Babylon, The Hobo Code) were quite good as the burgeoning counterculture crept in, but the first three you have to force yourself to watch the same way as if you were standing guard or something, and the last three weren't much better. We live in an age where the standards for television are higher than the standards for feature film are, and as such, I can't go along with all the rave reviews here. The pacing is off, the plot points seem a bit disorganized, and the acting leaves some to be desired. Go ahead and watch it though, after all.....it won an EMMY......lol"
5,Fascinating.,"Incredible attention to detail along with fascinating characters we manage to find intriguing from the first show to the last, Mad Men stands out on many levels. Jon Hamm. One has to witness the perfection in his performance for themselves to really understand Don Draper and Jon Hamm's talent. Don is flawed, the 60's family is flawed and so plastic we wonder if they ever really existed? They did - I grew up during the 60's, and my mom looked like Betts.Beyond fun, Mad Men is a weekly retro trip that is education, unforgettable and totally engrossing."
5,Hooked,"After watching just the first few episodes of the first series, I was HOOKED! It's a favorite in my line up now. I even went and purchased the first three seasons. The story lines are always entertaining and the sets are epic 60s. Peggy makes me think of the old Virginia Slims ad: We've come a long way, Baby!"
4,Mad Men Season One,Very good series. A little slow until you get use to the period and what was going on at the workplace at that time but still very good.
5,Well worth it!,Love this series! Great quality collection and wonderful price! Great stocking stuffer for my wife this Christmas! Can't beat it!
4,Advertising Avenue,"Actually, I cannot write a review about this product, because I bought it on behalf of a friend, but you keep sending me notices asking me to do a review. I saw Madmen on TV and thought it was excellent. The copy I ordered was second-hand and friend said that one dvd was faulty, but she says she can get it cleared at her local library."
5,Waiting Anxiously Everyday,"My husband and I just recently discovered this show and absolutely loves every single one of them. Great casting, great script, great everything! Just when we thought they don't make shows like this anymore. Thank You AMC! We'll be even more thankful if you release the DVD soon."
4,Unexpected,We ordered this because of all of the people we know who like the show. It wasn't what we expected (more comedy) but we do enjoy watching.
3,Mad Med Marriage of Figuro,I really like this show but it is too difficult to hear on my Kindle Fire. I find myself needing headphones to hear the background music and the dialog.
3,Ho Hummmmmm ... yawn .. but there is always a friend ...,"I guess the most exciting part of this book was the cover and that's about as far as it goes......As I read the book I could never really get into, forgive the pun, Susie Jones and I found her to be a petulant, dumb girl. I could never get interested in what was happening to her, but, her best friend Rhiordan is another story altogether. While dumb dumb is in London doing, who cares, her stepbrother, Adam not only ties it on with Sussies best friend but with the best friends mother, Meagan.Now that part of the boook was erotic and hot and is the omnly reason that I rated this book as 3 stars otherwise it would have been luck to hit a single star ...."
2,"easy to use, not strong enough","easy to use does not work as it says, kinda loud, not handy, i would not buy, want to return"
1,stupid stuff off of tv.,"Well, we expected it to really WORK! It does nothing but make a really loud noise and does not draw water, or wax or anything out of your ear. My husband tried it, I tried it and my son tried it. We all agree...It doesn't work for us.Thank-You."
1,Ear wax cleaner,"Very cheaply made. Does not do its job. I would not recommend this product to my family or friends, it does not work!"
4,Interesting Gadget.,It works very well. I find it is neat & less dangereous using cotton swobs.Less time going to ENT. Try it yourself.
1,Poor buy,"I liked the idea of using suction to eliminate excessive wax from patients' ears, but from the first time I tried it I felt cheated. Very little suction (get a bulb syringe) and only buy this product if you want to feel disappointed."
1,A manual built on beta software,"As I understand it this book was built before the toolset for NWN was even completed. It is dated and far from helpful. My advice is to go to nwvault, there are plenty of free scripting and worldbuilding tutorials put out by the community that are far better than this paperweight."
2,A gun to your head...,"This book is poorly organized, filled with typographical and programing errors, but they have world builders over a barrel here. This is the only reference guide and it does at least provide *some* insight into how to use the powerful scripting tools provided in the toolset.The scripting basics provided in this book at least help you to ask the right questions when you visit the various NWN communities so you can learn more.Can I recommend the book! No.Am I glad I bought the book? A reluctant yes.Don't expect it to answer all your questions... or most of your questions... or even a decent percentage of your questions. But if it helps ou ask the right questions, it's a start.Good luck!"
5,Oh the humanity!,"I watched this because it's about music and how it touches many people. But this movie is about more than the music, it's about some remarkable human beings, leading ordinary lives and doing extraordinary things. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this film."
4,Solid,"There's a good story at the heart of this documentary, an extremely likeable protagonist, in my opinion, and on those assets, the filmmakers need only to stay out of the way... They do, and consequently I think this is a very solid film, I think it's worth a watch"
2,Excalibur Electronics Brew Master,"You dont need to use this to find a good beer. And with so many microbreweries popping up it cant keep pace. Its fun, but not practical."
1,GARBAGE,"This phone and the additional handsets are all garbage. I purchased this phone less than a year ago and on each of the phones you can't scroll down, if you want to see who's called you on the caller ID, you have to scroll up through the old numbers before you get to the new numbers. I can't even turn the volume down on the darn phones anymore. I wandered why the price was so good, it was because you'll have to buy a new one fast because this one breaks so easily."
5,this pay per view is great,1st match raven vs big show 1st winner billy gunn. 2nd winner raven. 3rd winner big show. 2nd match chris jerico vs x-pac vs chris benoit vs eddie guerrero winner chris jerico. 3rd match stephanie mcmahon vs trish stratus winner stephanie mcmahon. 4th match triple h vs steve austin winner triple h. 5th match steven richards vs jerry lawler winner steven richards. 6th match dudlay boys vs kane and undertaker vs edge and christian winners dudlay boys. 7th match kurt angle vs the rock winner the rock.
5,Outstanding Art. Childish Politics,"Nightmarish and beautiful. One of the most unique and hauntingly original artists of our time. Unfortunately the text that goes along with the art sounds like a stoned 16 year old punk talking about throwing a spanner into the ""Republican War Machine"". I will say that it made me laugh a little."
4,"Baez's Version of ""Love is Just a Four-Lettered Word""","This is a great CD. But get ""From Every Stage"" for her version of Dylan's ""Love is Just a Four-Lettered Word""."
4,Majestic readings of Dylan,"Joan Baez has, without a doubt, one of the most stunning voices of the rock and roll era, and her personal relationship with Bob Dylan affords her the ability to perform his work from a unique vantage point. This collection is exquisitely packaged and includes teriffic liner notes, but is rather redundant, as the majority of her fans most likely already own ANY DAY NOW, JOAN BAEZ/5 and FAREWELL, ANGELINA, the original albums from which the bulk of this material is taken."
5,sweet sweet,"Why listen to this album?Easy. Dylan's songs are indeed best performed by Dylan. Because when Baez sings Dylan, the songs' personalities change. The songs are not what they were; the feminine feeling and the clear, utterly beautiful voice makes them perfect.So, yes, listen to Dylan... and Baez."
3,Average PPV,The undercard wasn't really that good. Basically matches involving feuds which had died weeks ago. The main event was amazing. It didn't last long but it was packed with action. If you like seeing finishers then there were plenty in the main event. There was only one title change but that title went back to the wrestler who lost it. The wrestler regained it on the following RAW.
2,WWF Rebellion 2000 Review,"The reason this event got a three was because of the fact that it just seemed like a long ""Raw Is War"" to me. Sure, it had a stellar main event, but the undercard was a totally diffrent thing. The only really good thing about this video was Kurt Angle vs. Rikishi vs. The Rock vs. Steve Austin. Another thing I have to complain about: Why do British cameras make everything look so blurry? It's like watching fast slow motion. Don't buy this video unless you want to see an awful undercard with an ok main event!"
2,very disappointed,This drawer liner was supposed to smell like lilacs. My dog smells as much like lilacs. I should have used freezer paper and saved a lot of money.
1,worst ppv of all time.,Not 1 match was entertaining it was all planned out. YOu could even see the ref hand hand the Rock the razor to cut himself.Don't buy this.
5,wrestlemania among wrestlemanias,every match is enjoyable. This is very hardcore pay per view. alot of backstage politics and any time wrestlemania is in some big arena or dome it makes it more fun.i suggest this to anybody
5,It was Awesome,"Me and my dad saw live and in person down in houston,tx and I'll tell it was the best Wrestlemania I've seen since Wrestlemania 15. I recomend you buy this because you wont be sorry."
5,Wrestlemania 17 because i refuse to call it X-7,"I own the ""I ordered the PPV and recorded it"" version of the PPV. Wrestlemania 17 was in no doubt the best wrestling PPV in along time. Every match was great, and it was nice to see Mene Gene and Bobby Heenan commentating during the gimmick battle royal was great. The main event was the best part, Austin turning heel in one night was awesome (AUSTIN 3:16 forever). This is a must have video, Pre-Order today"
3,Good DVD,This is a good average tape but has nothing that will make you stand or say whooooooaaaaaaa. I actullaly fell asleep during it You know the ECW tapes are alot better then any WWF tapes.

2,NOTHING TO SPECIAL,"i didnt watch this live. i hired this one...and i am sort of glad because when i watched it ,it was nothing special...... the austin vs hhh match could have been more hardcore and more action. a funny and confusing match with taker and kurt angle and his brother. higlights in this ppv was the ending of the chapionship match with the car...pretty amazing...dont know how they did it. i would strongly suggest to hire this out before spending your money....if you want to see hhh in some hardcore action...do get the royal rumble 2000.....it was amazing!"
1,STUDY GUIDE! NOT A TEXT BOOK!,"I wish I would've read the last review before ordering this product. This is a STUDY GUIDE, which usually comes FREE WITH purchase of the $... TEXT BOOK in book stores. Don't be mislead by thinking you're getting a great deal on a text book. It's not the real thing."
3,flannel seems somewhat thin,"Purchased two of these flannel flatware holders. They will serve the purpose we had in mind, keeping our knives, forks and spoons from making a racket as we drive down the road in our class B. Somehow, I had pictured them to be a thicker material, even though the advertisement mad no such claim. Ours arrives somewhat damaged, thanks to the post office sorting machine, but still quite useable."
5,"Love it as well, especially for the price","In short, I'm a big soup eater, not a big fan of the typical ramen noodles, too salty - there is another product on Amazon that is organic, good but not as tasty and satisfying as Myojo Udon noodles. I read the other review and am not fond of SPAM but this is very good and I also don't tire of eating it day in, day out. It is very nice that it also is on ""prime"" to avoid extra shipping cost."
5,"Better than Raman, a nice change! I add fresh ingredients though","I always have Raman around, especially my favorite MAMA noodles (reviewed earlier!) from Walmart! But these Udon noodles are such a nice change when you want a fatter, more noodley noodle! They cook up super quickly, just like raman, but I think they taste a whole lot better with some fresh green onion tossed in during the last moments of cooking. Or add some soy sauce. :O) Either way, these are wonderful."
4,Excellent Item!,"I use this scrubby regularly to clean the cage grill in my African grey's cage. It lasts a long time and does the job. Of course you have to use some elbow grease, but that's to be expected. Cheap to replace too."
4,The Great Revival in Wales,"I am always interested in Revivals, I got started by reading what happened in Azusa Street in California and found out that Wales revival started it all. Reading this was a mind blower, it lets you know God will do whatever it takes to reach the lost. This can happen again, it takes prayer and faith, read this book and be blessed."
5,Terrific follow up!,"Saw Mesrine - Killer Instinct over a year ago and couldn't find the sequel anywhere to rent it. I'm glad Amazon has it on instant download... it's just as good as the first movie - and if you Wiki Jacques Mesrine, it's amazing how close the movies are to this guy's real life."
3,Pretty Watchable,"This one's maybe slightly more interesting than Part 1, because this guy always had something going on - prison escapes, kidnappings, etc. Decent entertainment though nothing new."
1,"Plastic ""Crap-tastic!""","The name would lead you to believe that this is a powerful tool which can ""crush"" ice to a blended perfection for your favorite summer cocktail. Not so. The blender works fine for lighter fare such as eggs, fruit, etc. but ice killed mine. The problem is the plastic drive connection that under strain seems to break into a thousand tiny pieces. Also, if you try to find replacement parts at the B&D site, you're directed to a partner site that is less than helpful. I've had great success with their power tools but this thing is craptastic."
1,Hunk of Junk,Absolute junk! My husband got this for Christmas and by the end of May it was broken. It has rusted at the bottom of the base where the gears are. Smells like it is burning up when we use it. I was never all that impressed with it to start with. Now it is just another hunk of junk for the land fills. Too bad we did not just keep our old hand-me-down blender that was about 30 years old. (An Oster which just needed rubber seals replace.)
1,Worthless!,"I bought this blender and like others have experienced, it broke after just a couple of weeks use making smoothies. The plastic part onto which the jar sits broke and it is not a replacable part. Don't waste your money on this blender! Making such junk should be a crime."
4,A great collection,This is a great series and the collection is spectacular. I do like Pluto as a character but the it is the Walt disney treasures collection as a whole that I love.
1,A terrible event in whats been a terrible year,"The WWF has plain [bad] in 2001! Since about September 2000, maybe earlier, the WWF was on a downward spiral. It had become predictable and stale, and in 2001 it got much, much worse! Right now they are re-using old storylines, at Backlash they were basically just putting out new storylines but they were ultra predictable and boring. Usually they put on good action though despite the poor storylines, but Backlash failed. The whole card basically [was bad] except for the Hardcore Title match which was good but should have ran longer. People say Big Show & Shane was good, but it was in fact one of the poorest LMS matches ever! The big bump was the only good thing, except that Shane didn't actually touch big show. A really sh!t show compared to the high's of 2001 like WrestleMania and No Way Out."
5,Backlash always Has An Amazing Cover,"Has anyone noticed that HHH has a tedency for being on the cover of Backlash. Ever since 2001, HHH has been on the cover of 3 out of 5 Backlashes, and even though I hate HHH, they have all been great. Probably all of you wont find this helpful, but Im gonna rate the Backlash covers since 2001.2001: 10/10 (HHH makes a great cover. Everyone loves the Backlash 01 cover)2002: 10/10 (Another amazing cover by The Game. Im in love with the 2002 Backlash cover.)2003: 3/10 (The Rock vs Goldberg cover was to ugly to be a Backlash)2004: 9.5/10 (Chris Benoits Backlash cover was actually pretty cool. A good Backlash cover, better the 03 by far.)2005: 10/10 (HHH makes his Backlash cover return with an amazing one, that hangs up there with his 01 and 02 covers!)"
1,Not comfortable in Sun,Glasses were not comfortable in Sun and size was also big for me. It is non polorized glasses thus not as comfortable as it should be
5,The best I've ever had...!,"These are the best aviators that I've ever had.The best part is that the lenses are polarized hence the visibility is great on sunny days as they reduce the glare, this helps me a lot while driving.In all these are excellent glasses & I found them cheapest on Amazon."
2,looks fake,The sunglasses I received seem flimsy and not real. The case is not sturdy enough to provide any protection while in bags. Save your money and put it to real ones.
3,little problem,"I received my sunglasses, but I didn't got a warranty for my ray ban, I want to know if I could have my warranty or if I should return it"
3,"Nice design, quality not the same.",Design is classic and nice. However the quality feels different from the pair I had before. Frame seems lighter compared to the lens.
4,Good,Well I just thought it'd be bigger by the way they describe it... So I bought it to my grandpa and now I had to give it to someone else bc it's too small :( but other than that it's was good got here on time and everything.
2,Bad picture on buying options,"Hello, when I was selecting the item on amazon I view that the glasses where light blue whith silver frame; but when I got them I saw that they where all black, so I guess the catalog of the store is mixed up; so I'm afraid of taking another buy from the store, please fix this so no more people have the same mistake I got. By the way the sunglasses are great and look great."
3,SiZE MATTERS,"I got these for my birthday and they are WAY too big! I've got another pair, so after checking the lens size I saw that I needed the 58mm. I suggest going to a retailer to try them on first and make sure to get the lens size.. just a few mm's make a HUGE difference. Mine were also NOT polarized, even though the RB box says they are."
5,On time and Great Price,The sunglasses arrived speedily given that they had to be sent to Australia. The price is great and glasses as described. Best ever value
5,Exactly what I ordered,"These arrived on time and exactly what I ordered. Thank you. They are great sunglasses, good quality, well-made and classic good looks. I would definitely recommend them to friends and family."
5,Rayban Aviator,It was a long due..was waiting excitedly for it..the product is best in class as you know and came in the best quality as expected. Really worth..
1,Misleading item,We ordered Ray Ban Sunglasses Aviator Polarized but we actually got non-polarized although we paid for that.We were very upset!
1,FAKEEEEEe,"I bought the Ray Ban Aviator RB3025. It arrived on time, but they are fake. It took me a lot of inspection to determine that they were fake (they're made almost identically), but I could tell because the logo on the nose-pad is not interlocking, a tell-tale sign that your ray bans are fake. Also, the box it came in is not the right box. The real box has a recycling logo on it, but the one I received does not. Furthermore, the sunglasses were very good fakes, but fake nonetheless."
1,"Coating stripped, and no ""RB"" etching on the left eye lens??","There seems two issues with my ray ban aviator sunglasses with gold frame and green lenses. First, a small strip on the right eye lens toward the bottom is not coated. Well I don't know if it is a coating or something else, but the small strip is clear, not the greenish color and is clearly different from the rest part of the lens. Second, there is no ""RB"" etching on the left lens (the one that does not have the white rayban printed logo). I read on various websites which all advise that authentic pairs should have the RB etching. So I do feel that the pair I received is fake. This is very suprising to me as I bought them directly from amazon, not from any 3rd party reseller."
1,Very Disappointed,"I have bought these sunglasses for my son. After 2 months of use - nothing rough - the nose support broke. I Tried to contact the company's representative in my country but they refered me to the shop where I had purchased the sunglasses but told me that I will probably have to replace the whole frame and that this is not covered under guarantee. I wrote to the company in Italy - Luxottica - and never got a reply that took care of my problem. Evetually, I went to a shop that repairs these type of things a got it fixed somehow for $30 - so to summarize - poor quality product and ever worse customer service. I would have given it a rating of ""ZERO"" if it would have been possible."
5,exactly as described,"These glasses were exactly as described. The fit is great, along with the price. I would recommend this item to anyone looking for some classic shades."
3,Ear piece hinges so tight can't fold in,"I love the look of the glasses, but the hinges are so tight that one side I can fold in with much effort, and the other side I can't even fold in. I didn't return because I like the glasses and didn't want to go through the hassle of returning and getting another pair."
5,nice,producto excelente llego integro a ecuadorlo recomiendo es el originalme he ahorrado 120 dolares al realizar esta compra
2,color is different than adv.,"Disappointing how color is light blue at photo,but i received a dark bluish to greenish one? ? I dont like that photo that I got and its a hassle to return back and forth!!"
5,Long overdue,"A great, moving book for anyone who has adopted, been adopted or knws someone who has been in that process at any point and time. Poems cover everyone involved from the birth mother to the established sibling in a positive and understanding light. An unusual approach to an emotional issue."
3,Basics,This book does cover some of the basics and some feestyle techniques. Not truly a book for how to win tournaments.
3,"a decent New Age CD, but resemblance to Kitaro is striking","My ears are always open to a good piece of New Age music and I guess this CD delivers some of that. But why it has to be so much Kitaro - Yanni look alike? Zazen has a good, deep, crisp sound, but lacks originality, a ghost of Master Kitaro is present thru the entire album. So if you are really a Kitaro fan, you are better off listening to the Master himself."
1,"sorry tired, and old","Want to hear the best Kool & Gang? Then run away from this disc. Imagine your favorite band ages for 25 years, and then comes back to sing two of their best songs and a lot of their bad 80s songs as pot-bellied, short-breathed, middle-aged men. Jungle Boogie is the only real 70s song on here (+ perhaps Celebration), the rest is sampled from their sad attmepts to stay relevent in the sorry style of the 1980s. And then to have them resinging the songs as whinging geezers; this CD is a sorry stain on the memory of the guys who wrote Jungle Boogie. Enjoy if you must, this is the most disappointing CD I have ever listened to!"
1,Does NOT work with windows vista,It is a clanky piece of software at best... and to make matters worse it does not even work with windows Vista!!!!!!!
2,Not Great Print Quality,"A great film if you are into 1930s British horror, but unfortunately the print quality here is not so good. The version released by Arcanum in their Johnny Legend Deadly Doubles series has a much better quality print, PLUS a missing scene. AND it is paired with second feature FACE AT THE WINDOW."
4,Very good live album with a new line-up,"I heared Foreigner reformed with only Mick Jones as the original member. I had basically written them off as washed-up and over. How can it be Foreigner without Lou? Then I saw this CD. I actually laughed when I saw it and thought ""This has gotta be bad, almost worth picking up bad"". Well was I surprised at how good this band sounds! Kelly does not sound exactly like Lou Gramm but he sings in the same range and is a suitable replacement. The band also features former members of Dokken and Bonham. In fact, they also do a snippet of ""Whole Lotta Love"". Only hit missing here is ""Double Vision"". This is a pleasant listen for any classic rock fan. I am a ""casual"" Foreigner fan, not a die-hard. SO far, the best of the ""Extended Versions"" series."
1,BUYERS BEWARE ! ! !,"This product is a result of the vulture culture of SONY BMG.There is nothing ""extended"" in these ""extended versions"". This is a masacred 2005 concert in Las Vegas. The full concert includes two more tracks and is available with a DVD under the title Foreigner Live 05."
1,Childish,"How many books has Suryavan Solar written? It seems too many... With only one, it would have been enough. They all lack of a minimum sense of respect towards authentic authors, from who he has copied his apparent creative glimpses. The romantic dream of the adventure in the amazonian rainforest was a fairy tale he used for his sleeping baby, years ago. It seems he told the story so many times that now he beleives it's true.I think this is a book for people looking to beleive in something. Which is perfectly okay, but let's be honest about it. Nothing more and nothing less."
3,"Good Preparation Guide, but ...","I realized the following:- This book covers only 80% of what will appear on the exam; you are on your own for the rest 20% (other books, practical experience, tests, classes etc.) - Of course, no book will cover all topics on the exam; Just that, be aware of it.- The attached CDROM contains a test with good questions, but simply too many errors to be considered reliable. I suppose they didnt do quality control check on the CDROM material, before publishing ... which is bad.- Despite the limitations, the book is well organized and written, provides a good strong foundation to both taking the exam and also a good reference."
3,"great book, cd is trash","this review won't matter anyway since cisco retired this exam, but i think the problem with this publication may be symptomatic with other similar titles. the book itself is great. the cd however has a lot of problems with it. i am refering to the test engine. the answers are wrong, the simulations crash a regular pc, and unless you take it with a huge grain of salt, the test with wrong answers seriously makes you doubt your knowledge and shakes your self-confidence. proceed with caution!"
3,Done in a rush....,"If you want a study guide to become a CCNA then this book offers more than you will actually need for the exam. But be warned about taking the practice exam. It might shake your confidence a bit. The score you get on the practice exams is often misleading. The exam itself needs a lot of editing. A lot of the items on the practice exam are gibberish. To make matters worst, it seems that no one bothered to publish an errata yet. An update on the practice exam is in order."
3,"great song, average music","Why did they fire Gabriel Yared, the first composer of Troy's soundtrack ? This question will remain forever. I've heard Yared's score and it's EXACTLY the same style ! Yared's score is maybe a little more powerful.Now THE question : is Yared's score a lost masterpiece ? I would have loved to say ""yes"", but the answer is unfortunately ""no"". It has the same main default than Horner's score : no great theme. And the same quality : the end title song (sung by Tanja Tsarovska alone, this time, in a language that seems to be ancient greek (I'm not sure))is simply a jewel. But well : Yared had three months to finalize this all and Horner three weeks : when you hear both works, you can really NOT guess this, so you have to recognize Horner's amazing talent, even if the firing of Yared, I repeat, remains totally unjustified."
4,"Titanic, anyone?","While the music on this soundtrack is awesome, I can't help but think about the Titanic soundtrack. It almost seems like he got some of his inspiration from the Titanic score. It also seems that Mr. Horner likes percussion, especially timpanies, and brass instruments. At least, that is what I am getting out of it. The vocals are beautiful and haunting, and the music majestic and exciting.I think it is a good buy. Enjoy!"
1,Lousy,"Horner's score is a pastiche of themes he's used in countless other film scores. While his work during the 80's was still fresh and interesting, his recycling of those same elements today is tired and grating. Listening to the score I was constantly reminded of other films. ""Oh yeah,"" I'd think, ""that's that horn he used in Red Heat. And in Willow. And in Aliens. And in every score he's written in the last 20 years."" With so many ""borrowed"" elements, Horner's score never finds its own voice (except for the 'wailing woman', and I can't believe anyone can enjoy her caterwauling) and remains a pedestrian, rushed, and utterly forgettable effort. Yared's score is far superior: haunting, uplifting, epic. Shame on Warner Brothers for forcing its removal."
4,"Excellent Soundtrack, But Missing Some Cuts",This stirring soundtrack contains all the music for the lengthy battle scenes in the film but omits some of the shorter pieces. I was especially sorry that the rendition of what appears to be the theme for Achilles only appears briefly within the battle sequences; the stand-alone version that occurred early on in the film isn't included on the soundtrack album.
3,Good for a Horner (or Groban) fan,"Personally, this soundtrack didn't really inspire me to want to see the movie. It was beautiful, don't get me wrong, but it was very much like Horner's other scores. I do like his music, but the highlight for me on this cd was, of course, Josh Groban's 'Remember'. I actually was given the cd because of that song. That song is beautiful, and Josh sounds wonderful singing it (I cried the first time I heard it- it's haunting) Definitely the best track on the cd. Overall, I'd say give the soundtrack a try, but it's more of a cd to borrow from a friend than buy for yourself."
2,similar,"sure composer's recycle some of their music, but this was ridiculous. Not only was Shostakovich's horn solo from his fifth symphony somewhere in there (so that was even ""borrowed"". Horner sure didn't write that all on his own), but the whole time I was expecting Zorro to appear because it sounded just like ""The Mask of Zorro"" that Horner composed for. Sure it's a good soundtrack if you don't know any of the music that Horner has done before. This just didn't do anything for me. Now, Braveheart, Lord of the Rings, Gladiator, and The Last Samurai, those are excellent soundtracks."
3,missing what i got it for,"Ok, the only reason bought this soundtrack was because i saw the trailer and i loved the music in it. Normally, i wouldn't have gotten soundtracks just because of the trailer. That music isnt necessarily in the soundtrack and can be a bit misleading sometimes. But, i went on the website and the music playing at the website was the music from the trailer, so I thought, it has to be in the soundtrack. Well, it isnt. Most of the soundtrack sounds too soft, too much the same and it doesn't have a particular melody to it. I give it a 3 because some of the music is good. And hey, you have to give it to Josh Groban for singing Remember so beautifully."
1,Grating,"James Horner has plundered ideas for this soundtrack from many sources, especially Gladiator. It sounds like an effort from a first time composer who has basically slapped together something that we have all heard before. This is not even a C Grade effort and if I was Hans Zimmer I would sue."
1,Unforgivable Treason,"Originally, the soundtrack was written by Gabriel Yared. His music was also used in the trailers. But one month before public screening this music was thrown out of the window on the negative comments of a couple of people from a non-professional sample audience on unmixed music being used against the composer's will and without giving him the chance to modify the music on specific requests. Instead there came James Horner and wrote this soundtrack in one month... Apart from the fact that I don't believe it was but that Horner simply negotiated behind Yared's back to get to a blockbuster after being missing from it for a number of years, this soundtrack is without heart and strongly based on Yared's original ideas, copying even the melody for Remember.My suggestion is to wait for Varese to negotiate with Sony on the release of Gabriel's soundtrack and get the real musical heart of this movie."
4,Reminded me of Peyton Place,"Amy and Isabelle was an engaging read. I devoured the book in 2 sittings. I'm struck by the similarity to the 1950's novel Peyton Place. Amy and Isabelle are remarkably like Constance and Allison McKenzie, the mother and daughter in Peyton Place. Another similarity is the many characters in the (New England!) town(s) that are interspersed through both novels. But Strout isn't as melodramatic as Metalious, and her characters have more warmth and humanity. I wish her continued success as a novelist."
2,I really wanted to like this book,"Although the author achieves some very nice things, ultimately Amy & Isabelle is a disappointment. The character of of Isabelle is written ridiculously shallow, and the happy ending is absurd.Still, the charater of Amy is written with uncommon depth -- capturing the troubling uncertainty of the teenage years with remarkable insight."
2,Two's the limit,"I give the author one star for Amy's sexual encounter with Mr. Robertson, which I'm surprised no one else has mentioned. It's sweetly erotic and well-written. The other star is for the scene in which Amy's hair is cut. This moment, though a bit too symbolic for my tastes (overt associations with Rapunzel), is genuinely gripping. The rest, I can't say much for at all. The endless nature descriptions are extraneous. The author has no faith in the reader's ability to discern her message and therefore bangs you over the head with it. No book can succeed when it attempts an over-the-shoulder narration of an entire town's population. Strout's narration of Isabelle attempting to read ""Hamlet"" is condescending. Finally, Amy's quoting of Edna St. Vincent Millay is not believable. I get the feeling that Strout is a fan of the poet and grafted her appreciation onto a character to whom it absolutely does not belong. Feh."
4,Outstanding Debut Novel,"Elizabeth Strout has found the words to capture the essence of the complex relationship between and mother and daughter and put them into her first novel ""Amy and Isabelle."" The descriptions were so well written that I could almost feel the heat from those hot summer days in the office of the mill. I loved the way the author provided us with little updates of the people in Shirley Falls and inserted them here and there throughout the book. The supporting character were strong and believable especially Fat Bev and Stacy. The UFO's and Debby's murder was unnecessary, but Isabelle reading Hamlet was extremely funny and the haircutting scene was very poignant. Ms. Strout has shown a lot of promise with her debut novel and I am eagerly waiting her second."
3,Too much dull description;too much hair,"I liked these characters, but they kept doing the same things over and over. How many ways can you describe a girl's long, blonde hair? Not enough to make them interesting. Also, each chapter begins with a mundane description of the weather. Who cares? If you want to read two really engaging books about a teenage girl, check out Elizabeth Berg's Durable Goods and Joy School. These are poignant, evocative and short with only vital details included.Joy Street describes the relationship between a teenage girl and an older man, but in a believable, beautiful way."
2,"Quiet, Too Quiet","I had read glowing reviews of this novel here and in the Times and decided to give it a go. It was billed as a quirky, quiet story which focused on the most difficult time of a mother/daughter relationship: adolescence. And although I did not enjoy this book at all, it did meet those above expectations. However, it is far more quiet than quirky, and throughout the novel I kept debating whether Strout was deliberately trying to prevent the reader from truly understanding and caring about these characters or if they were just simply that dull. The writing is fair, though nothing spectacular, and while the author has taken great pains to tie up all of the plot's threads by the novel's end, nothing really resolved itself to my satisfaction. The relationships described never rang true for me; I don't believe that a tale so lacking in humor and spirit can really be touted as ""true to life""."
3,Mediocre at best,"This story was okay. I didn't feel like it really said anything. The murder, UFO, and the math teacher were all stories that lead to nowhere and felt incomplete. This book didn't offer any real escapism because it mirrored too much of everyday life and you came away with nothing to add or subtract for having taken the journey. Easily a forgettable read."
2,Not good,I've seen this movie enough times as a kid to know that this DVD is missing several scenes and it skips a lot. I would not recommend getting this.
4,bewyld,"A light hearted mystery mixing humour with crime solving, on the whole I thoroughly enjoyed this book as it kept me guessing ""who dunit""."
3,Lassiter is back and sarcastic as ever,"A decent read. The plot was stretched a little thin, and you must believe in miracles. As always there was humor and suspense and fun dialogue. Good character development. Levin has done better and can do better again. Still, over all an okay read."
5,Essential guide for the best seafood from Australia.,"This book is a must have if you frequently find yourself lucky enough to enjoy Australian seafood. It features almost all of the commonly available species you are likely to find in a restaurant or a fishmonger.This book enables you to plan your meals- it mentions eating qualities for each species, and oil contents so you can actually ""get the good oil""! It also features latin names, habitats and similar species guides.Recommended marketing names are also used which is essential for Australian exporters. It is recommend to the novice fish eater and the professional seafood exporter. You can also get this in a laminated version which I suppose you could safely take to sea with.Hard to find, even in Australia but well worth the hunt. Fantastic photography throughout of the whole fish and fillet."
4,Perfect,"These movies are classic. It was so great to get to share both of them with my little brother and introduce him to the movie that started the ""interactive P.O.V."" horror movies."
4,Wish this were a spray instead of a gel.,I mistakenly thought I was ordering a spray product. My cat is not happy with the gel at all and I'm getting zero cooperation. But the product did arrive quickly.
2,Returned,"This did not work, I have since returned it. Don't waste your money on it. Glad I was able to return it as it was pricey."
1,Didn't work for us.,"Encouraged by the reviews, I bought this for my rat terrier. No results with the first bottle so I contacted the manufacturer. Felt I wasn't using enough of the gel so bought a second bottle and tried again, being careful to follow their instructions to the letter. After 2 bottles I still see no change in her teeth. Looks like we will have to get a cleaning at the vet after all."
1,BEWARE SMALL DOG OWNERS!!!!!!,"I have to warn small dog owners about using this product without researching the ingredients. Yes, it is all natural but did you know that rosemary oil can be lethal to small dogs? It can cause seizures. Our mini dachshund had a full blown seizure within a week of starting this product. PLEASE, for your friends sake, do not use this product until you read the warnings on using herbal oils in dog treatments or food. I cannot prove that this product caused the seizure but the dog has had no such episodes in his four years of life. He is healthy and full of life. I will not continue using this product on my dogs after reading the effects and dangers of essential oils, specifically rosemary oil, in dog treatments and food. Essential oils are much too concentrated and are nothing like the whole plant. A drop of essential oil is 100 times stronger than a pinch of the herb plant. This product may work great but I will not risk my pet's well being for the sake of a quick fix."
3,Book review,"The illustrations in this book are cute, colorful and age appropriate. The text is very basic, suitable for young toddler, but not for children over 3 years old. My 2-year old son, who love trains, loves this book, and we read it often. The flow of the text is nice enough for reading aloud to him. As a mom, I wish there was more of story or at least more information, like the names of the train cars, within the book. There are informative pages inside both the front and back covers, but they are not part of the book text. If you are looking for a fun, quick read for a young toddler who enjoys trains, this would be a good book. If you are looking for an educational read or something for an older child, then I would pass on this book."
2,I Love Trains,"This is not what I expected. The description was wrong and I was very frustrated that it was torn, marked in with markers, and the binding was more than used.The story is good though and my children loved that part -"
4,GOOD book!!!,It's cool and it features Frankenstein!!!!I think it has alot of cool choices and it is one of my favorites so far
5,""" I'm Back""",""" I loved this book. After a recent break up from a very long relationship, I realized that my dating skills were next to nil. Meeting new women and to begin dating once again was frightening. After reading ""Seduce Me! What Women Really Want,"" I was back on track. The author undestands today's women. He also understands the difficulties men face in looking for a new relationship. My confidence level has risen, and though I haven't met that one special woman, I am meeting women, dating and having fun. I am actually enjoying being single. I highly recommend this book to both men and women."""
3,poor packaging,received quickly but CD case wasbroken inside package. dealer triedblaming post office but it was notpackaged properly. was not offeredrefund!
4,Mediocre,Of course it is all relative. A mediocre Trigun episode is so much better than anything else.Vash gets back into the Gungho-Gun-fighting groove in this volume. The first two episodes are linked together (much like the B.D. Neon episodes). The fights are...decent. Not much humor. The villains are kind of...'meh'.It seems suprising that there is only one volume left in the series. Hopefully many of the loose ends will get tied up.
3,An Interesting Read,"Rockin' Robin is a tale of power and abuse. It explores the depth to which abuse can affect one's life. The novel's urban flavor was exhibited through its use of gritty language and depiction of violent circumstance. This aspect of the novel served to convey the harshness of the story told in put you into the mind of its lead character. Juxtaposed to this facet of the book was its emphasis on the importance of family.The characters described, although some were over the top, really kept your interest."
3,It was alright....,"""Rockin' Robin"" was good, it could have been better. It was a little wierd at times, but I hung in there until I finished it, and I was like ""what the....."". Anyway I'd borrow it from a friend. Hopefully Ms. Johnson's next novel is a little better than this one!"
3,Rockin',"Robin is an abused girl struggling to cope with what life has dealt her. Or has she?Nelson enters the Gray Pearl Hotel to relax and think about his future plans and meets Robin. As he wonders if they could build the ultimate relationship, Rockin' has a plan of her own. Living within herself is Robin the shy girl who escapes when Rockin' comes to her aid. Rockin' is angry and protective and vows to get revenge on her abusive and no good daddy, Jiles. If someone else gets in her way, oh well.Though at times you have to wonder if this book is believable. From Nelson dealing with his own angry issues to Chanel dealing with a drug using husband. Stephanie delivers just not effectively."
1,Propaganda,"Complete disregard for how different societies evolve and the role of colonialism, religion and ethnic differences."
2,F@#*!N movie,"this movie has a good title, but it could of been better directed. There were no monsters in this film like showne in the front cover. it has unnecesary sex seens. I give it credit for for having the dumb blonde actresses."
1,boo,pretty crappy & lots of mistakes. no help at all as usual with kaplan.. get the princeton review book instead!
5,Dutch blues legend,"I live less than 10 kilometers from where Cuby lived (he died Sept. 26, 2011) so of course my review could be seen as a bit biased but let me tell you that I can still remember the first time I heard ""Distant Smile""! Living in Assen I had heard of Cuby & The Blizzards, even saw him from a distance so every now and them but I had never heard their music. That changed when I visited a friend and while going through his CD collection I stumbled upon a compilation CD. He was glad to put it in the player and it blew my mind. I still remember asking him: Is this Cuby & The Blizzards? Are you sure? It was so good I that I took the CD out of the player to confirm that it was really Cuby & The Blizzards!Harry Muskee (alias Cuby) has worked with blues people like John Mayall, Eddy Boyd and Van Morrison. He's heavily influenced by John Lee Hooker. Just get this CD and listen to it. You'll be amazed."
5,Rolls so well!,My son has the plan toy fire truck and school bus. Both roll so well and are incredibly durable! He carries them around everywhere. He's 15 months.
1,no,this book was a joke. I feel like such a fool to have bought this book. It does not deserve a review.
4,Works well,"This is a sturdy, all metal device. Mine came slightly misassembled out of the box. It was pulling hair more than cutting it. Looking at it for a few seconds I could see that the sliding part of the blade was misaligned with the clamp/handle. It took about 30 seconds to fix this. The clippers are held together by a wingnut, and really easy to dissassemble/reassemble. As another reviewer noted, the included attachment does not fit on these clippers. A web search for the same item showed an attachment with clips on either side that would, in theory, make it work. The useless attachment is the only reason I deducted a star.Once assembled correctly, it cut both my arm hair(fine) and beard(coarse) with ease."
1,Clippers don't clip Yorkie hair at all!!!!!!!!!!!,These clippers don't clip Yorkie hair at all... booOoOoo.I really hoped that the claim that they are good for dogs that are nervous about noise was true...Anyone have any other ideas?Scizzors seem too dangerous for a dog that jerks around all the time.
1,Couldn't finish it...unwatchable dreck despite a hottie like Jennifer Connelly,"If you are hoping for a good Jennifer Connelly flick this isn't it. Silly story, tedious pedestrian performances. I regret ever trying to sit through it."
3,Long lost author,"Valley of the Assassins as well as Mr. MacAlister's Strike Force 7 are good fast paced adventure stories. I have both of these books and have reread both more than once. I would like to find any other of this author's books like Driscoll's Diamonds to see if other novels are as good as these. Compared to the James Bond books, I would rate Mr. MacAlister's books as much better than the worst Fleming/Gardner, but not as good as the best of the Bond books. In general they are a good read. There is no excess violence or x-rated language/scenes. Suitable for later teens through adult readers."
2,The fun is over all too soon,"This little gadget is cute and fun to watch, but the liquid flows so quickly the process ends in less than two minutes and every iteration is more or less the same, with little variance. I recommend sand sculptures much more highly. The flow of the sand can be adjusted to run more quickly or slowly, it forms a different pattern every single time, and when it is done flowing it shows a pretty and unique pattern while it waits to be used again."
3,Try it!,"Latina is a great, easy-to-read magazine that attempts to incorporate everything an 18 to 30 something year old Latina would care about. It scratches the surface of fashion, beauty, politics, and culture. The articles are informative, but unfortunately not too in-depth. However, it's just about the only magazine out there that addresses make-up for the Latina skin tone, clothes for the Latina body, and Latino political, health and cultural issues...so give it a try!"
1,BUY SUMMERSLAM 2001 INSTEAD!,"...Summerslam(2001) was 10x better. WHY? well Invasion had Jeff Hardy vs. RVD... BUT! Summerslam had the same match except a LADDER was involved!. This should be reason enough to buy Summerslam, but I will give more examples.. Summerslam had a cage match Invasion didn't, Summerslam had a spectacular opening match Edge vs. Lance Storm can't say the same for Invasion. Spike dudley went threw a table! Stephanie looked way better in this PPV than in Invasion... And can you smell what the most important reason to buy Summerslam is... (hint: Rocky, Rocky, Rocky) You got it the Rock makes his PPV return against the 5 time, 5 time wCw Champion Booker T, Last but not least the reason why you should buy the Summerslam DVD is because I was there LIVE!... Well hope you don't waste your money on this..."
2,Invasion,Let me start by saying that this was one of the worst angles in wrestling history. The timings were bad and this story-line made ECW and WCW look like a joke. You should only get this as a rental. This is because every match besides Jeff Hardy against RVD sucks. If they didn't have that match this DVD would be getting one star.
2,DISSAPOINTING!!!!,"This ppv really didnt live up to its hype.When this ppv was over it left me saying ""IS THIS IT?!?!?!?!""The show stealer was RVD vs jeff hardy with some nice wrestling but this match is nothing compared to a rvd/lynn match in ECW.The main event was pretty boring (i hate tagmainevents).regal and raven had a bad night and i expected a bit more from kidman and x-pac.If you want to see 1 of x-pac's best matches get summerslam 2001, he was vs tajiri and it was a very good match, and not to mention summerslam 2001 is WAAAAAAAAAAAAy better!!!!And wrestlemania 17 even tops that so id suggest to get wrestlemania 17 even if it didnt have the whole fn show it had a breath taking TLC2 match which topped there TLC1 match.We all know wwf vs ecw/wcw is a historic ppv but i dont think the wrestlers knew that as i know they can do better.Trust me on this 1 guys get something you will watch over again!"
5,Outstanding,"After being a HUGE fan of Type O Negative I searched out for every recording from them. I have heard of some of the bands on this album but let me tell you. IT ROCKS! I recently searched all over the internet for all of the albums from Autumn, they are no longer together and they are out of print, the haunting vocals from them will leave a chill down your spine. Moonspell is another ""type o ish"" group with equally haunting and DEEP vocals. ""When the sun hits"" by The Gathering is also an eery but in a strange way uplifting track that will kick your taste buds for more. If anything this album is a must for any Goth Rock nut."
1,way overpriced here.,"This product is $20 on the estee lauder website. Love this product, have used it for years. But at least don't overpay for it!! Do some homework, you'll see."
2,Very thin Novel,"Danny is a bit of a loser and constantly gets picked on by Wanaka, New Zealand's bully Brock. While undergoing a severe beating he is saved by a girl new to his school. Becoming obsessed with her he soon discovers she has a lot of similarities to escaped psychiatric patient Liggie Turner who everyone suspected had drowned while fleeing the asylum. Bloody Liggie as the legends told axed up her step father and mum after they drowned her kittens.Whilst this book is a lot better than other Catram novels such as the pathetic Road Kill it's not one I'd fork out much money for as it is an extremely short novel. Look for it in your library."
5,it works!,"I have a parrot, so I know from moth traps. I've tried a lot of different brands, but none of them did much of anything. This one actually works!"
1,Better than his other work...,...but still unbelievably terrible. Somehow this throws a very bad light on the best band that's ever walked the face of the earth (Pavement). Sounds like an aging alcoholic in a terrible recording studio who can't sing. Wait...that's exactly what it is.
5,A must-read for anyone interested in relativity,"As a Ph.D. in astrophysics, I studied relativity as part of my professional education. I've read many textbooks and popularizations. This is simply the best popularization, bar none. Anyone should be able to understand it. Even the professional physicist is likely to learn something, if not about the substance of relativity, then about how to teach it to undergraduates. Outstanding!"
5,You'll finally understand!,"While attending MIT, I thought of writing a book on General Relativity, one that would explain the inherently deep concepts contained therein, but without the extremely complicated math! Then I discovered it had already been done....! This book surpasses my loftiest dreams. Could it be this simple... YES, it is. And what fun, to boot! Get this book, you will not regret it."
5,The best,This game is probably the most fun game I have ever played. It is really creepy and violent and the plot is really good. The thing I like best is how twisted this game can get. BUY IT NOw
1,EnGenius SN920ULTRA 900 Cordless Phone,"The delivery of this item was good (although they didn't ship to Canada, had to ship to a US address and have it shipped to me from there - doubled my shipping costs). The 920 unit worked for about 1 week, turned out it was a defective unit. It was promptly replaced with a newer version which seems to be working well (again had to have it shipped to the US address and sent to me). I would have preferred to have a refund, but the seller did not seem to be too receiptive to that and really wanted to replace it with a more expensive unit. This unit now works well, but I had to have it completely reprogrammed (cost of $50.00) because even though it came with the base, it was not the master handset and could not access all of the features. When all is said and done, I'm pretty sure that I could have bought it locally for the same cost."
2,Had a bad luck with this one,"I thought that the monitor was great when I purchased it. Ordered Sony DeluxePro SDM-X72/B on Jan 21 and on Feb 7 had to contact Sony because the monitor went bad. All I could see on the screen were tiny vertical lines. Sony had no problem replacing the monitor but it took them 2 weeks responding to my original inquiry. I called Sony every day for a 1 1/2 week. After 2 weeks, they informed me that they couldn't replace the exact model since this model is not in production any longer but offered me SDM-X73/B. It is identical to the originally purchased monitor except for the design of the case. I expect to receive the new monitor next week according to Sony Rep."
2,Dead weight,"There's two good reasons why Solar Circus never could quite break out from the ""Dead cover band"" circuit. One is that they never tried very hard to do just that. The second is that the band had all of the outer trappings of the Dead (the jamming, the groove, the tie-dye argot) and none of the inspiration. Oh yeah, and no songs that were anywhere near the Weir/Barlow league, let alone Garcia/Hunter. Any of SC's cds are good background soundtracks if you're in your late Forties tooling down the interstate and pretending that your Lexus is an old VW microbus. For lasting pleasure, though, nothing beats the genuine article, even in it's recent Jerry-less incarnation."
1,not for children,"Im sorry, the words in this book are so hard, so over the top and hard my kids sat there looking bored sick. I don't know what age group this is for: more like college level. the pictures do not go with the store. Its the original Phantom words with cat pictures. Why didn't they just draw regular people or use a cat adapted story? Weird"
5,Excellent for younger children,The Miss Patty Cake CD's are excellent for younger kids. Our grandchildren have all enjoyed them. My only regret is that they have stopped some of the CD's. What a shame!
4,solid live set,"The packaging says this was recorded in 1996, and it's a pretty solid show, with songs spanning several of their albums. Definitely worth the six or seven bucks it'll cost you (i've seen them live and this was a fair approximation of what their shows are like). definitely recommended if you're a fan; i picked it up not having heard it, and i was pleasantly surprised."
2,Remedial writing and plotting,"This is garden variety urban fantasy genre - you know, the loner outcast protagonist realizes magic is real, makes magical friends, finds out she fits in after all, blah blah. It's all been done much better by others, particularly Charles de Lint and Neil Gaiman. I had bought this book on the initial gushing reviews and was sorry to learn later most of them were the ""friends of the author/ free copy if you review"" variety. Well, I paid full price and have never met the author. I wasn't able to get past the average writing, nominal characterization, and I won't even get into the glaring typos and continuity errors. Look elsewhere."
1,Not my cup of trea,"Unfortunately I did not enjoy this book. I relied on the reviews on this page and went out and purchased all 3 books. I didn't make it through to the middle of this book. I am very broad minded but found this book to be out of my league. If you are in to monogamy then this book is not for you. I was really disappointed with the way the book was going - again maybe it was just me but I wasted a lot of money (as the prices of these books is very expensive). Sorry Amy Lane but I won't be buying any more books of yours. I am avid reader and have over 3,000 books in my library and I have to admit that this one was the worst I have ever read."
5,Amazing Series from an Amazing Writer!,"I read...a lot. Ask my husband, he's tired of tripping over books! In my quest of the perfect read, I ran into Amy Lane's magical series. Instantly, I was hooked. I was enthralled over the lead female protagonist's metamorphosis (Cory) from angry young goth girl to an amazing young woman. This change occured, in part, from her learning to love and accepting to be loved. Adrian, a seemingly ""bad boy"" vampire, comes into her life ever so sweetly, and shows her she's definitely worthy of love. It's a wonderous world of vamps, shapeshifters, fey, and humans alike. In the midst of the drama of trying to all get along, it's pretty clear that one thing is static amongst all...the power of love."
5,Beautiful baby!,"The descriptive writing, the character development, the new twist on a classic theme are all surprising and rarely found in a first time novel. Amy Lane has crafted a universe of her own that is comfortingly familiar and yet new and unexplored. Each of the characters has their own voice, their own personality and yet they are inextricably woven together and dependent upon each other. The story line is great, and is so well written that it often reads like a movie script-you can see the action taking place in your head. The sex is beautiful, well described, but never gratuitous. The book would not be the same without it.If you can overlook the poor editing (typos and such) you are in for a very good read.The only question I have is, where is the sequel?????????"
3,"Its ok, needs alot of polish","Vulnerable seemed interesting enough when I ordered it. I know of the area and have visited the foothills many times. The beauty of the area is breathtaking. I liked the concepts of the author, but I felt it was too amateurish. A good idea that had it baked a little longer it would have been FANTASTIC. Amy Lane could be a really great author, she just needs an editor that cares."
1,"Vulerable: The first book in the ""Little Goddess"" series","I was shocked at the gross sexual content as I browsed the pages of the book.To me ""Little Goddess"" infered a book suitable for younger readers. It is not.It was a gift for my son. But - the book was destroyed - thrown out - trashed.I wish the review had been more detailed regarding such content.So I can't say anything regarding the story line."
3,An easy read,"This text is more or less a ""popular"" introduction to data mining. It is well worth reading and it is well written, but don't expect to become an expert with just this book as a base!This might be a good book for someone who is either contemplating a career move into this area, or for someone who is professionally affected by data mining and wants a ""quick and dirty"" as to what data mining can do and what it can't."
3,Dance Music but Not Perfect,"What I didn't like about this CD is that the songs are all spliced together into one long mix. I didn't like the way this was done because the end was abruptly cut off some of the songs such as ""This is How We Do It."" The songs were decent enough dance tunes but I didn't like that they were cut off."
2,"Made in China... poor, poor quality","Easy to install, but just work well like 6 months, later you will have a lot problems with the door sensors, later with the main controller, and finally nothing will work. I got a big deception of this product."
3,This item and the detangler should be included items.,"One would think that this product would be something that comes included in the packaging of the Mantis Tiller itself along with the detangler. It's like buying a new car and paying extra for the windshield wipers. Does it work?Honestly i have not used the tiller without them. Personally, I really don't want to know the difficulty of not actually having them on in the first place. They seem to function. Plus I bought everything at once. ""I'm a Freaking Farmer Now""...It's an absolute rip-off if you ask me to have to purchase this and the detangler separately. As usefully as I feel the Tiller is, this isn't really nickel and dime-ing, it's more like $15 and 20 dollar-ing me...So my rating is more an indictment on the price than the actual product itself."
5,Island of Tears by Troy Soos,I found this book to be very fast paced and very interesting. It is a very good historial novel. I would recommend this book.
2,Worked for a bit...,"I've had this DVD player since Xmas 2005, and recently it hasn't been working right. It will randomly open in the middle of playing a DVD, and if your DVD has a minor scratch on it, forget it. Really frustrating. But, my friend does have the same exact one and she's had it longer with no problems, so I guess it's just luck of the draw."
5,THE BEST DVD PLAYER AT ANY PRICE,"I now own three of these. They say, ""you make it and we will play it"" is very true. No matter what I feed it. Very satisfied."
3,Short of some basic features,I was surprised when I didn't see any volume control on the dvd player or its remote.
1,This DVD player does not decode DTS,I purchased this DVD player because I wanted to be able to play divx movies. The ad stated this player did decode DTS. Well to my suprise it didn't I called Philips to verify this and they told me it was not designed to decode DTS sound tracks. Also the picture quality is terrible my old Pioneer DVD player has a much better picture output and it isn't even a progresive scan player!
1,1 star for the horrible remote control,"I don't know what philips engineers are thinking of, as they have the same terrible remote control in at least the 2 dvd players we had. It's not ""user friendly"" at all."
1,Trouble...,"I'm having a lot of trouble with this product. It seems that it will only play my DVDs for about 4min before loading the DVD over again, and starting all over again. I've talked to Philips Customer Service, who are ""looking into it"". I would recommend buying a more expensive and better DVD player, and not to trust Philips Customer Service."
4,Great DVD Player,"This is a great little DVD player I've had since 2004. Originally got it due to not having a DVD player and wanting to start getting and watching them. Was one of the lower priced models at the time, but is still working in 2008 and reads perfectly. I also got it because it reads burned DVDs and at the time seemed to be one of the few that did that. I know everything is going HD with Blu Ray, but if you are looking for a simple DVD player I would get this one."
5,Excellent purchase,"I am extremely pleased with this unit. The picture is startlingly clear and sharp- up until now I thought my TV was getting old and blamed my lackluster DVD viewing on it- now I see it was my old DVD player becoming more and more faulty. With this new DVD player everything is vibrant and very well defined. This unit is tiny, very tidy and quiet. It runs perfectly and the remote has an amazing reach. I certainly feel that for the price I paid its everything I expected and more."
1,"in less than a year, it won't play your DVDs","I ordered this product July 8th of 2005. Fast forward to June 21, 2006, less than a year later, the DVD player doesn't recognize DVDs. I called up Philips and the company wants to charge a $40 out of warranty fee (parts is covered for a year but labor is covered for only three months) to replace the unit.I won't be buying a Philips product anytime soon."
1,"Stopped working after a few years, like in other reviews","I had this player for about three years and it worked great, playing all different types of discs, different regions, avi files etc.Then suddenly, today the standby light is blinking and the player won't respond or open and I have a disc inside from a rather expensive TV show set.Most of the good reviews are probably from people who haven't had this too long. Yesterday, I would have given this player a 5 star review but a DVD player should last more than 2 or 3 years. Don't buy this. See the other reviews, a lot of people had the same problem."
1,not reliable,"I bought this product in january and in just one month the player started to fail reading DVDs. At the beginning it just happened from time to time, but as the time passed problems appeared more often, until becoming a real lottery and a matter of pure luck whether it played the DVDs or not. Now the player does not read any disk whatsoever. Maybe it is a good player, but it lacks reliability."
1,Dead after 7 months,"This unit died after 7 months of normal use (2 dvd's a week). I called Philips and they wanted me to pay $15 to talk to a service rep. When I asked what would happen if I talked to the rep and he found out it really was dead, the operator told me they'd offer me a replacement unit for $44 plus $9.50 shipping. That's more than a new unit!Never again will I buy Philips. I bought this from Amazon and am very disappointed with them and Philips."
1,"Worst customer service, But Nice DVD Player","I bought it brand new 2 months back and today I found that no button is responding. I called the Philips and they said it is not under warranty. Since i have all the paper work and orginal reciept they said thats fine but in our system it is not showing under warranty.Later on they agreed to think about it after sending the registration card. I will update the review after their response.you are lucky if you don't have to call customer service.Update: After many calls they have aggreed to exchange the player with new one. Yesterday I recieved new DVD player. It works well, not complaints now at all."
2,Great when it works,"Well let me start by saying we didn't get this player form Amazon. Maybe we should have. Regardless, while this thing worked it did just like everyone else said, plays DVDs and a multitude of other formats without issue. It is missing a few features, but nothing you can't live without in a $70 player.However, the first one we got was broken out of the box, an aberration that can happen to any priced brand/model. But now our second one has failed after about 6months. So might just be a case of 'get what you pay for'. I suppose I should also say that I do sometimes fall asleep with the thing still playing so it goes all night, but my Mitsubishi player has taken this kind of abuse for years and is still humming along.In hindsight, I would have spent the extra money and gotten a player in the next price bracket up and will when I replace this one."
1,WORST DVD PLAYER EVER!,"I can sum it up in 25 words or less. Don't buy this horrible horrible piece of equipment! Or 10 words. Doesn't play DVD's without this ugly distracting VHS distortion on the image! Seriously, I tried multiple diff't wires... I tried S-Video, I even tried diff't DVD's -- They all looked like crap!! Do Not Buy & if I were you I'd never buy anything made by PHILLIPS again. SERIOUSLY. Worst product in its class of all time!WATCH OUT! >:("
1,Buy at your own peril...,"I bought this one in late Nov 2004, but didn't start using it until mid-Jan 2005. Early March 2005 it wouldn't play DVDs anymore, but CDs and the other formats still played well. Customer support wouldn't get me a new one since it was past the 90 day warranty, even though it had in actuality been used for less than 2 months.I went for the ""Reduced cost exchange"" that they offered, paying $30-something to have them ship me a new unit. Now, 88 days later, the same thing has happened again. I've sent them a message already and will call them tomorrow and see what they do now that it's within the 90 day warranty. I'm not going to shell out another $30-something for another piece of junk that dies after such short time.In all, a good price, it plays a lot of different formats but if you're planning on using it for watching DVDs for more than 2-3 months after you buy it then stay far away from this one."
2,LOUD,This DVD player is loud - it is difficult to ignore the loud buzzing noise in the background while watching a movie. It was so annoying that I had to return it. I don't recommend it.
3,Solid with one issue,"This player has been good so far. Navigation with the remote is pretty intuitive, though not as easy as some I've used. The player has balked at a few DVDs that my old Memorex cheapo player would play, as will my laptop. And the remote can be finicky. I'm happy for the price, but it has been rather quirky."
4,"good for the money, not very reliable","I purchased my first DVP642 1.5 years ago in Walmart. I really liked it's play-anything feature. It died a month ago, bought another one in Amazon, for only 39.95. If it will stay another 2 years - it's OK."
3,Stopped working in 2 Days; Amazon good on returns,"I liked the price and the reviews here but had a problem with the player. Had it shipped free and after two days of playing DVDs, the player started making high-pitched squeels through the TV speakers.The player then degenerated further by not turning back on after being turned off. The first symptom was fast-paced flashing of the power button. You then would have to unplug the player for an hour to have it turn back on. Needless to say, ""it's dead Jim"".This unfortunate turn of events allowed me to test Amazon's return policy. Just go to Amazon.com/returns and you get instructions on how to return the player, along with a postage paid mailer you print out and tape to the box.Call me brave, but I have another one shipping out to me. Let's hope this one works more than two days."
1,I loved this DVD player -- In the end it broke my heart,"I bought this player about 10 months ago and was very happy with it -- so much so that I highly recommended it to several friends. It seemed to play just about any format I threw at it.Then, day before yesterday, the power light started blinking and the unit wouldn't eject or power on. After several attempts to cycle the power I started looking for help online. Apparently I'm not the only person experiencing this problem.So now I'm in the market for a new DVD player. It's unlikely that I will purchase another one of these machines."
5,Withstands the test of time,"I bought this DVD player almost three years ago, and it remains my DVD player to this day. The inputs are many, and it faithfully plays all DVDs and most AVI and MPG videos I throw at it. It can even be programmed to become a region-free DVD player (search Google).One word of caution: it will NOT play DivX and XviD movies with quarter-pixels. You will need to re-encode them first. I recommend using G Spot to determine the specifics of your video files before burning. Consider VideoHelp dot Com for more information."
4,I've never had problems,"and I've had mine for about 2 years now.I've played tons of divx on my player and only had one play with no audio. a handful of divx files played with jarbled pixelated color, but it was always fixable by hitting the menu button (main menu, not disc menu) twice. Have no idea why that works, but it does.If you're not using this to play divx stuff, then there's better players out there, but at $49 bucks now, it's a steal."
5,My Savior!,"I had several DVD backups that would not play on my old player but did so perfectly on this one. I have also played avi and mpg files and was thrilled that they played perfectly (although the lack of 1.5 zoom on these files is annoying).5 out of 5 stars in ease of use, installation, support, and looks good even on my old tv.I bought it recently and it came with the latest firmware upgrade so no issues there."
3,"Not the best, but...","I do not agree with the other person that this one is the best player. It lacks few features. Suppose, basic things...no play,pause, rew, fwd buttons on the player. Then if you stop the DVD, it won't start again from that scene, it will start from the very beginning, which is not a good idea to fwd all the way to that particular scene where you stopped! It doesn't ""Resume"" from that scene. The best thing is it can read Dvix! NOT ALL Divx! Sometimes it takes time to read the disc & the whole player start to shake/vibrate like a cell phone!To me it is a good player among Divx players in the market. The price is very reasonable in some stores, Wal-Mart is selling in few stores $69.99 and also available online store. Target is also taking the same price. This is gonna be my extra player just to run my few hundreds Divx movies and Pioneer(DV 333) would be my primary DVD player for the DVDs!"
1,VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"This DVD player stopped working the first day I took it out of the box. Picture quality and sound were good, but the image was constantly freezing during the FBI warning and none of the controls worked so I had to unplug the whole device. I tried to play the disc several times with no success. The DVD was in good condition and my other DVD player had no problem readind it.The whole experience was a big disappointment and I returned the product immediately. I'm going to shop for another brand and I strongly advise anybody not to take a chance with this product."
1,Couldn't perform basic functions,"No sooner did I start using this DVD player than it stopped working with DVDs. It still plays CDs, but it won't read a single DVD. I tried troubleshooting using information from Philips and online to no avail. I contacted Philips and they said that I will need to ship it in to have warranty work done and that I must pay for the shipping. While paying for the shipping is a standard clause of the warranty, I think it's BS to have to pay to fix a DVD player that stopped working within its first week of use. I will probably by a different brand rather than have this one fixed."
3,Does the duty until a chip gives up the ghost,"I have had very little problems with this, my second DVD player, in the course of use. At least, not until eight months into its life, when it inadvertently began to turn off every time I pressed play. Eventually the device would not come on at all, trapping my DVD. I called for a replacement, and paid $30 for a new one (yes, you must pay for a new one if it is within the 3 to 12 month window of the warrantee). In the meantime I used my entire toolbox to pry open the DVD, owned by Netflix.The replacement arrived rather quickly, thanks to the good customer service of Philips. But now, about a month into the life of the replacement, the same problem has occurred once, and I am not optimistic about the future.In other words, you may expect your money to last only a limited time. Keep your eye on the DVD market if you buy this model."
4,This DVD Player is a bang for your bucks.,"I had this dvd player for 2 days now. It plays all the dvds I threw at it. I got it mainly because my old dvd player (from 1998) does not play my home movies (which I burned on DVD+RW). It also play my new Disney dvds without problem. My old one would freeze on certain frames. In addition, this player looks great; it is slime and it looks high tech. My old player is 5"" height. Finally, at $67.## plus free shipping, it is the lowest price I found on the net. I gave it a 4-star bz the player is a bit noisy than my previous player."
1,DEAD for no reason in 8 month!,"i bought this at the end of 2004, and started to use in Jan 2005. it worked fine at first, but sometimes it has rewinding or forwarding problems. it's a little bit annoying, but i was ok with that. sometimes it freezes, then i had to stop it and restart. but,anyway, it still worked. however, in early aug, the ""standby/on"" button kept blinking, and all the buttons on the panel or remote do not work. my cd was still in the tray, but it cannot be opened. i called philips, and was told it's not in the ""90-day warrenty"" any more, they would charge me for 15$ for technical surpport. but, what they told me is just to unplug/plug, press the buttons. none of that worked. they also suggested reduced price exchange, which would cost me 41+ plus shipping, and further cost for removing the cd. i wouldn't waste more money on that!! now, i read the reviews, some people had the same problem as mine. i think philips really knows the problem! anyway, i won't trust this model any more."
4,amazing dvd player,"I bought this DVD player to be able to watch movies in .avi (divx, xvid, etc.) format. Works well with most of these files, however some are not compatible, so you will have to discover by trial and error. Plays all regular store-bought DVDs. The remote is badly designed. The buttons are not laid out in an easy to recognize layout. Everyone in my family has pressed the scene back button instead of the rewind button numerous times, which gets pretty annoying fast. Finding the pause or play button also takes several moments, even if the room is lighted and you can see the remote. Also, I think it makes a lot more noise then my old DVD player. You shouldn't notice it though, unless you are specifically listening for it."
3,"If You're Not a Brand [...], This Is for You","ThePhilips DVP642 DivX-Certified Progressive-Scan DVD Playeris the perfectly priced DVD-player for those concerned with reliability and price rather than brand. It's a straight-forward player with remote that provides menu access to change aspect from standard to 4.3 to 1.85:1. The remote isn't quite as intuitive as others, and you may need to get used to the fact that the L-R buttons in the center are for FR and FF -- it took some for me so I could comfortably navigate discs without having to look down at the remote to be sure I was scanning a chapter rather than flipping to the next one. Audio and subtitles are controllable from the remote, but it lacks an open/close button -- handy if you want to make it easy for your wife to get up and change the disc for you. One of the best features, of course, is its ability to play any region of disc by simply punching in a code. And at $40, it's perfectly priced to buy a couple of back-up players just in case."
2,Problems with non-US dvd's,"Although the player can be made region-free, it has a tendency to reach buffer overruns when playing non-US dvd's (particularly from Asia). Whenever this happens, the player takes about 5-8 seconds to reload its buffer, leading to an annoying onscreen pause in the movie. Could just be my unit though. I have no buffer/delay problems when playing US dvd's."
3,Great if you dont want to use the component out,"I got the player at Walmart for $54.95. It has a very stylish look. Very slim and compact. I loved it until i hooked it up to my plasma tv with the component outputs. It had horrible blue lines across the screen and the picture flickered. I though at first that i had just gotten a bad set of component cables, but that wasnt the case. The dvd player looked fine by using the regular video-out's, but not as good as it would have if the component outs had worked. This dvd player would be great if you dont have a HDTV or EDTV. I really wished the component outs had worked because i love the DivX ability. Too bad, this appears to be a common problem on this player."
2,Looks good but won't play them all,"I purchased this DVD player in Dec of 2006. The machine sets up easily and the picture is great, when it plays the DVD. I have come across 2 new releases that this machine would not play. I contacted Phillips and all they could say was that the machine would not play the new ""dual-layer"" discs and no firmware upgrade would be offered. My asceessment seems to be that this machine was manufactured a couple of years ago and they are no longer offering any supports or updates."
1,Disappointed,"I'm disappointed in Philips. They used to develop quality products, but in the past few years the quality has just faded. I received this DVD player as a Christmas gift and it worked perfectly until I bought The Prestige and it didn't play. That's the only DVD that won't play. This product isn't even worth 1 star. Huge waste of money."
1,"Good software, crappy quality",I guess the idea in the beginning was good - to design a unit that would read all formats. The reason I bought it was to be able to watch DivX/Avi movies and it didn't have any problems reading those formats. Besides I finally could enjoy some MP3 albums that were recorded on DVD medium that my friends gave me. However right from the start it had problems reading brand new DVDs. The unit was stumbling as if the disc was dirty. Only it wasn't and my old DVD player didn't have any trouble reading it. I'm on my way to take it back to Wal-Mart right now. I'm going to give Pioneer DV 588A-S a try. It is more money (MSRP $129) but you reach that point in life when you don't care if it is a hundred bucks more expensive as long as it is good quality. (A stab in the outsourcing campaign:) Besides it can also read SACD's
4,Mostly pleased,Other than the remote does not have a button to open and close the tray the product has performed very well. The picture output is better than any other DVD player I've used.
2,broken out of the box,The DVD player I received is broken right out of the box. It can't read most of the disks I have. Eventually I bought one from a local electronic store and returned the bad one to the store the next day thinking it will somehow make its way back to the mfg.
2,Good While It Lasts,"I never came across a DVD whether my own recordings, or scratched/damaged factory jobs that wouldn't play.The problem is that of the two I bought, one only lasted about 3 months. Phillips promptly replaced it and told me to just throw the bad one away. An indicator of the disposability of the product. This one went to storage so I don't know how well it is holding up after a year.The other one lasted a year and one month before it decided to not eject or load DVDs any more.Bottom line is it works great, but you have to consider it disposable after a year or buy some kind of extended product replacement warranty if you can find it.My advice - look elsewhere. Maybe a brand that starts with an ""A""."
1,Died after seven months,"Got it in December 2004 -- died at the end of June 2005. It's been in my bedroom armoire, never moved. Started not responding to remote commands and now won't load DVDs or stay 'on.' As with all, only 90 day warranty. This is my second DVD player in one year. I now know why they all have such short warranties."
4,Plays everything!,"This thing is slim, well built, and plays every format listed very well. It will skip or run slow on DivX/Xvid files with a reaaaallllyyy high bit rate, but other than that quality is superb."
4,Awesome DVD Player,"I've had this player since Dec '04 and it's been great. The player plays all my CDs with AVI, JPG, and MP3 content. Even slightly scratched DVDs work great. I had rented a DVD from Blockbuster that came scratched. I watched half of it on my PS2 and the rest was unreadable. I used other DVD players from computers and the data was still unreadable. I had almost given up but then I popped the DVD into this Philips player and I was able to read most of the data. Although the DVD skipped a bit, I was able to make out the rest of the story. Even my parents' foreign DVDs played fine when other generic players failed. My whole family is pleased with this purchase.My only discontent was over the controller's design. The buttons are all oval/circular and make it difficult to locate by touch alone. The player is slim but long unlike other players. I guess these are rather negligible factors compared to how much I enjoy having this player. I'd recommend this player to anyone so far."
1,"If you are looking for a way to waste money, buy this Phillips DVD Player.","This DVD player is awfully flaky and very picky with the discs it wants to play, even genuine DVD movies. It performs poorly with DVD+R files especially. I had it for one day and I totally hate it now. Don't buy it if you can wait until they improve the technology. It's just a total waste of money."
3,mixed feelings,"Feature-wise, this is a great DVD player for the price. It has progressive scan, component video output, optical audio output and co-ax audio output. Normally I only find these features in high-end players.However, the low price doesn't come without a reason. My first one died after 2 months. While watching a rental DVD, it all of the sudden froze. After stop/start, it could no longer read any DVDs - the laser head died.Now I got a replacement. It jitters from time to time playing commercial DVDs. My guess is that the player uses a cheap error-correction module that doesn't do its job very well. (those DVDs play fine in my APEX player, BTW)I am leaving you to decide if it is worth the money."
1,A COMPLETE SCAM,"THIS PRODUCT NEVER WORKED. I WILL NEVER BUY A SO-CALLED BARGAIN AGAIN. STUPIDLY, I NEVER KEPT THE WARRANTY AND THREW EVERYTHING OUT AFTER I RECEIVED IT. TO RETURN IT TO THE FACTORY AND THEN WAIT FOR PHILIPS TO GET ME FOR MORE THAN I PAID FOR IT WAS NOT AN OPTION. SO, IT SITS ON TOP OF MY TV, AS A REMINDER THAT A BARGAIN IS NOT A BARGAIN. I REALLY GOT TAKEN. RUTH B."
4,Great buy,This is a remarkably robust DVD player. The ability to configure it with simple region free codes is a strong plus. No more hassles with european or asian DVDs with this one. The unit has all the standard features and no obvious flaws. I bought two and could not be happier.
5,Plays just about anything I throw at it,"I've had this player for about a year and a half or so, since my old Apex died on me. It plays DivX and Xvid movies very well, though there are some that are compressed with an off audio codec that it can't handle. It is a simple exercise to recompress the movie with VirtualDub and use MP3 audio (for stereo) or AC3 (for surround) to get it to work. I love the player, worth every penny!"
4,Plays just about anything you can throw at it.,"I've owned this model for almost a year and I've been very happy with it. It plays DVD-R, +R, +RW, VCD and SVCD, as well as Divx movies. You can set it to play NTSC, PAL or both and there's a region free hack for it. My only problem with it is that I haven't been able to get my cable TV remote to control it, but that's probably user error. The included remote works fine, it's just one more of many lying around.For a player that will play just about any format you'll run across at a good price, you can't beat it."
1,Rreturned a month after opening,"This is the second Philips DVD player that I have had fail on me in less than a year.The player worked alright for the first few weeks but the spinning of the disc would occasionally be extremely noisy. That didn't seem to effect the audio or picture quality, but we did have to turn the stereo up louder than usual to drown out the disc rotation. Last week halfway through a movie (which ironically was spinning silently) the picture became extremely digitized and choppy. At first it would only do it randomly but within days every dvd we put in would do the same thing. Already packaged up and waiting to be returned a month after being opened on Christmas Day!"
1,This DVD player toyed with my emotions,This DVD player died after only 8 months. That's not cool. The power button just blinks at you and does not respond to anything. Like it's taunting you and your pile of Netflix that you so want to watch.
2,"Cheap, but very unreliable","Although cheap, especially because it can be unlocked to play all region DVDs (which is why I bought it) after a few months of use it fails to read the discs about 75% of the time (the dreaded ""NO DISC"" message). Based on other reviews, this product appears to be hit or mix, so while it's cheap, you're gambling whether or not it will work correctly. Based on my experience, I would not purchase this item again."
1,A cheap make,I have recieved this DVd and when I hooked it up the DVD tray was not opening.Called Phillips customer service and was very dissappointed with their service. Called Amazon they happily replaced my DVD.Excellent service from Amazon.But I would recommend people not to buy this DVD player.
3,Reliability Issues,"I purchased this player two years ago because of its progressive scan ability and also because it could be hacked through the remote control to run DVD's from any region. It worked beautifully for nearly two years and then the bottom dropped out. Suddenly the DVD tray froze and could not be opened, the display would flicker or not come on at all, the power would not stay on. I am sure that it is a power supply issue but as cheap as the player was to buy it is not worth fixing. If you need a player that offers 'All Region' capability and good picture this is the one. You should however, plan on replacement within a couple of years. At this price it's doable."
4,From King Bret to King Owen;,"Well Bret Hart the older brother of Owen Hart won the King of the Ring a year ago back in 93, and now his younger brother Owen has decided to follow in his footsteps.How sweet.....Also the WWF title match was Diesel vs Bret Hart for the WWF title.Honestly I am sick of seeing Bret/Diesel fight on p.p.v's,they fought at at the 1995 Royal Rumble,they fought at Survivor Series 95, and they fought at In Your House 6 Spring Explosion in an cage match(that wasnt too bad) but anyway this was their first encounter which was better than expected.But anyway everyone knows Jim ""the Anvil"" Neidhart saved Bret from getting beat by Diesel so Bret could later face Owen in which was a match of the decade that's right a cage match at Summerslam 94.But enough of SummerSlam,you'll just have to wait to read my review on that one and believe me in JR's words-It was a slobber knocker."
1,Batteries,The phone got this rating because I can't use it. I can't get the battery compartment open. I have emailed both contacts on the web page and called the phone number. Got no response to the emails and the phone was always busy. I just hope we don't have another power outage before I can get some help with this. It's my only link when the power goes out.
2,Didn't perform as expected.,"The product is generally good, except it only works on speaker mode. This limits it considerably and I can't recommend it."
4,Big -Button-Best Deal,"Woke up morning at age 53 and suddenly realized I couldn't see the little buttons on my cute Pink Barbie Princess Phone. I wasn't sufferring from any any visual impairment - it was a simple case of of spending 25+ years working on computer screens and being too vain to actually wear glasses. So, what's a girl to do? Well she puts vanity aside a looks for phone with big buttons. TheNorthwestern Bell Big-Button Corded Phone Plus with 13-Number Memory (20200-1)was perfect. Good construction, easy to use,good sound quality and at less than $30.00 the price was just right!! I just wish that the phone was available in another color besides white. Powder Puff Pink or Wedgewood Bleu would be nice!"
1,Arrived with non-functional handset,"The outer construction of the phone seems to be well made. However, the handset appears to be non-functional. Calls can only be sent or received using speakerphone."
5,phone,"Bought for older person. Easy to see/feel numbers. Good sound quality. Users pleased. Needs longer cord, 6 feet is too short. Bought 25 ft cord."
1,It's a piece of junk.,"It doesn't cut my hair work a darn! It won't hold on to the comb. I wish I could get my money back. If you agree with the positive reviews, I'll sell it to you."
5,Professional Products = Professional Results,"You could spend the money on this, or you can buy a cheap one at a drug store for 20 bucks. The difference is, the 20 buck ones are basically disposable. They are toys. This is the real deal."
4,"The UN, a real threat to our sovereignty, what's left of it...","The reviews by the actors, et, al, andamazon.com (for once), I agree with!Get this video Mr. and Mrs. America!Educate yourselves now to protect ourchildren's future(s). JFK tried to warnus and look what happended to him! Seealso Tom Valentine, Col. L. FletcherProuty, Lt. Col. James 'Bo' Gritz andJack McLamb...Look up Historical ReviewLibrary on Internet also. You've beenwarned!"
4,Professor,Indian Movie - Professor received as ordered. Shammi Kapoor inacted and accomodated for old professor as available position was only for old age person. Movie seemed to be of North Indian Village. Enjoyed.
2,Finicky and unstable,"Maybe I got a lemon, but the boat I bought for my son had problems from day one. First, the switch to turn on the motors was finicky...it wouldn't turn on. I had actually taken it back to the store to return it. When I went to show the clerk how it didn't work, it worked. I had off and on problems getting the switch to work up to yesterday.The boat has also been unstable, with a definite list to the right. The list made it difficult to steer, giving it a tendency to ster to the right. Yesterday, we put it into a pond and it again listed to the right. This time the list continued until it was all the way over on its side. A few minutes later the boat sank."
1,disapointed,"it was my first time shopping for this kind of items on line,it would have been cheaper at ToysRUs besides one of the propellers was broken..I m not sure if it was the shipping and handling or the person who sold this toy failed to disclose that this was a defective item"
1,WHAT?,drawn out. boring. would be better if you threw out about 1500 words and made it a short story. blah
3,"Masterpiece, chopped, and sown together","I read this book, and half way through, discovered that it was edited, with large segments missing from the original text.The translation is excellent... although a smack too modern to be Goethe. But the editorial work done on the masterpiece is a shame. Significant parts were cut out from both parts I and II, for effect (this version was to be broadcasted over the radio).However, for an introduction to Goethe's Faust, this is a great read. One could read this in one sitting. But for real scholarship, and those who would like an ampler fill... take a full unabridged translation."
3,Give it a chance,"Sure Toni Brown's voice can sometimes be grating and/or droney but the musicianship of the players on this cd is absolutely fantastic. If you are a die in the wool Dead fan this disc is well worth the listen.I think those who are interested enough to experiment will find Toni Brown Band live to be very tasty. For a taste purchase one of the ""Gathering on the Mountain"" releases from Relix Records."
3,Just Okay,"It's sad when a band name becomes public-domain.I don't know who owns the name ""New Riders Of The Purple Sage"", but this is NOT the same band that played ""Panama Red"".I've seen the same thing happen to ""The Flying Burrito Brothers"".None of the band members are originals, but the sound is true to the original.There are no stand out songs, there is no stand out singing. But this is a pleasant effort nevertheless.You could do a lot worse. Everybody's heart is in the right place and I'm glad to have this CD as part of my collection. Just be forewarned- this is not your father's ""New Riders""."
4,Great Value!,"Any fan of the Blue Series should definately get the DVD over the VHS. Volume one contains episodes 8-14, and includes both the Japanese w/ subtitle and English Dubbed versions of the show! Considering single episodes on VHS are the same price, you just can't do wrong with the Blue Seed DVD."
5,Omake Omake Omake,"I bought this DVD and the rest of them too... If you like adventure and a little romance this one is for you. IT's pretty much about this sacrafice girl, Momeigi . Who has to over come her fears of the enemy her twin sister Kadi the plant like creatures the Aragami. But her bigges problem has to be her underware. Don't worry this is not one of thoughs icky rape the innocent girl animes. this one has it's bloody parts, but they are pretty breif. You can listen to this DVD in both English or Jap. When in Jap. you can here the ledgendary Magumi. The main reason to buy this DVD is the the Omake theatres. They are in the extra part of the DVD. And they are worth buying alone."
5,Accurate and Objective,"I'm not a fan of PBS or NPR and would not consider them reliable sources of information, but I have to say that this documentary was excellent. I could discern no bias here as the editors did not sugarcoat the government's (the SEC in particular) role in the Bernie Madoff fiasco. They were given every clue and every lead regarding his corruption yet still found the charges against him to be unfounded. This documentary did a magnificent job of highlighting the fashion by which ordinary people become contaminated by greed along with the need to maintain a beneficial status quo. A simply superb hour of TV."
5,An enlightening discussion of balance,Being a woman I am sensitive to the ways that Yin is described. Too often it is about negative energy and darkness. This book discusses Yin as potential and a necessary and equal aspect of balance. With that in mind we can come to understand the ebb and flow of chi as we practice Tai Chi. We can think of Yang energy as water that can't be contained or directed without the cup that is Yin.
2,(oh-so-slightly) Endearing and (pseudo-exploitative ) Cute,"2 1/2These once ""in the hip"" Japanese female goofy rockers have not aged so well, as I am sure they did not even sound all that well when they first emerged and became all the rage for a brief time. Perhaps the sad lack of cultural connection to different music forced ""open minded"" music listeners to dig this, but the overtly exploitive and gimmicky nature of these tunes, not to mention their dumbrock songwriting style, would have any hardened musical cynic laugh at the mere premise. Still, some of these foolish little odes to the little things in life carry enough kinetic weight and vocal intuition to remain slightly endearing, switching from it's extreme light-heartedness into (rarely accomplished but often attempted) unabashed child stomping glee"
1,This does not rock!,"If you want to rock with Japanese girls then get Ex Girl. If you want to feel as though you are listening to the oldies station on you Satelite Radio, then this is for you."
2,Recommend D'Addario EJ45 or EJ45C Instead,"I did not find the sound of the lower, wrapped strings to be what I would consider ""bright"" or ""new string sound"", but downright tinny, which is not what I would go for in string sound. The D in particular stood out inappropriately both in volume and in its overtly metallic sound.By way of disclaimer: I have only tried one set, and these on a Cordoba 50-R. I did not play them for more than a couple days because I was rather annoyed by the sound of them. I am not a professional, but have been playing dutifully for some years.I have always found D'Addario EJ45 strings to be well-balanced, reliable, and of reasonable life. If you are looking for an ""extended play"" string I have found the D'Addario composite EJ45C to be just fine, though I think I prefer the tone of the EJ45s."
4,"Diagramming practice, practice, practice.","The text is a little tight and small. That's the only complaint. The flow of the book is good. Where this book shines is in the many practice problems following each new topic. I will also never forget the many things that a squirrel can do to a tree.I also recommend Grammar By Design by Cindy Vitto. Top-notch diagramming text. Sister Bernadette's Barking Dog makes a nice introduction to diagramming and discusses the history of diagramming, but doesn't really teach it."
2,Not what I needed,I really thought this book would tell more about the growing of hydrangeas and it does not. I bought it for my husband and he does not like it.
4,Pretty,This was not what I wanted. These are great pictures but I want to learn more about my hydrangeas not your's or anyone else's. My bad! These are very pretty pictures and are well produced. This collection inspided me to start taking my own hydrangea pictures. It would be great to use the slide show program to make these pictures your screen saver.
4,Jupiter Crashes,"This video contains the episodes: Jupiter Comes Thundering In, The Power of Friendship, Mercury's Mental Match, & An Artful Attack. When Jupiter arrives the Negaverse starts stealing rainbow crystals from humans on earth. Jupiter kicks butt in this video and does it good. Mercury has an admirer too. Serena and Darian finally sit down next to each other and don't fight, only because they are getting their portrait done by an artist."
1,"Great idea, poor execution","My girls ended up with a tub full of suction cups that came off the product and they play with some of the pieces in the tub. The suction cups did not stick to our tile wall very well at all. And when I could get them to stick, it was very hard to line everything up so it'd flow well. My five year old's can't do it. I had high hopes, but this toy was a big disappointment. Sadly, I bought two boxes so they'd have more pieces to play with. Big Fail."
2,A minor effort,"The NRPS only released three albums after 1980 and this was the first (originally issued in 1989). Note that John ""Marmaduke"" Dawson was the only original member at this time, and the group had a very different sound than what they were known for in the 1970's. It was great to have Dawson back, but he no longer dominated the studio efforts. As a result, the album is decent, but unremarkable, and serves mainly as a curiosity. It's unlikely that you would listen to it on a regular basis. Get the classic '70's albums first."
5,This is an EXCELLENT album.,"I'm surprised to see this album so overlooked and neglected. I love this album! I've been a New Riders fan since their first album. Some of their work in the years after was a bit inconsistent, but this one is great. Buy it. You won't be disappointed."
4,"Clear, well-explained demonstrations of advanced techinques.","This video is a great way to improve your dressmaking skills. It shows advanced and time-saving techniques for the home sewer.Video format allows you to rewind and review the methods. You actually see the techniques demonstrated on a sewing machine, close up. One criticism is the interviews of well-known designers which are excessive and of minimal value. These could be replaced with more sewing techniques.Overall, I highly recommend the video, and have watched it frequently for great tips (my husband has even watched it with me!). It provides an excellent reference."
4,Delicious new flavor - two concerns,"Oh man, I do adore this flavor of Luna Bar. And yes I'm a boy. Come out of the closet, gender-defiant Luna eaters!One concern. As of August 2012, this listing doesn't specify how many bars are in the box. If you're paying more than 99 cents per bar, you can do better at Trader J's or BB and B (if your BBB carries items like this). Targée has them for about $1.15 each in bulk. I think there are bulk places that might beat these all. Caveat emptor.But this flavor is delicious."
2,Straps too short,"The compartments are great but the strap is too short for the size bag. I will be returning it, I need to carry it on my shoulders not in my hand."
5,"Great ""teacher"" bag - 3 years and still in good shape","Last June my ""school"" bag died two days before the end of the year. I looked around all summer for a replacement, and could find nothing in the stores. I ordered this bag (in gray) the end of August. It arrived the weekend before school started, and was just what I was looking for. It is the color of the dust on the floor where the bag spends much of its time, and zippers, which my old bag didn't. It has enough pockets to store my traveling ""office"", and has adjustable straps so I can carry it over the shoulder. But the very best thing is that it stands up where ever I put it. My colleague bought a new bag, spent a lot more, and is not nearly as happy with what she got. This product is an A+ for this teacher.*** This bag just completed year 3 at school, and it still in excellent shape-what a product!"
1,Smell made me sick,"Unfortunately, by the time I realized how awful the chemical smell was, I had sewn a new handle on it so couldn't return it. I put it in an outside shed, where maybe it will age and I can use it sometime.Yuck! I should have paid more attention to the other reviews that mentioned the smell. Maybe some of the bags have it worse than others."
3,LOTS O' INFO,Good book if you want to know EVERYTHING about how a computer works. Very technical at times. Covers everything. Tests on CD are good. Bought Exam Cram practice tests and has alot of same questions. With these 2 am very confident in going into test in 2 weeks.
4,"Very good, but perhaps too much","This A+ study guide contains a lot of information that will help get you ready for your A+ exam. The problem is that it almost includes too much information. There's some info in here that's irrelevant and sifting through that material to get to the stuff that you really need to know can sometimes be frustrating.You won't want to use just this book alone to prepare for the exams. However, this book in conjunction with some of the other APlusTutor.com Recommended books should put you in really good shape. This book is very helpful when you use it with other books."
2,extremely neutral.. almost too bland,"if you want your babys' nursery to be soft and colorless then this book is for you. unfortunatley, it was not for me. I ended up returning it or gave it away; cannot remember."
3,Good movie,"A teenage story, about a boy and his mother.Very funny,great cast, good message and very entertaining.The story of a teenager's struggle with the need to be popular and how Charlie achieved that from a slightly different angle, very entertaining, I would recommend this movie."
3,Cute story,"Unconventional high school romance. Anton Yelchin is a pretty talented actor as well. Glad I watched this. Not the best movie ever, but kept me interested for the most part."
3,"Okay, but no noticeable difference in chlorine smell","This is a nice, medium-mild gel soap with a fresh and pleasant fragrance. I can't say much about it's unique qualities of removing the chlorine smell from my skin, though! I didn't really notice any difference when I use this versus other gel soap right after swimming."
3,"not really ""essential""","Misleading title. Not the man's classic Alladin tracks from the late 40's & early 50's. These were recorded for Johnny Otis's ""Blues Spectrum"" in the early 70's, with backing by Otis's band, incl. son Shuggie on guitar. The trivia item here is that by this time, Amos had suffered a stroke leaving his left side paralyzed. So Amos is singing and playing right-hand piano, but it's Johnny Otis playing the the left-hand piano part.Still, some very good R&B: Amos was still an exuberant singer, and, although as little hoarser, still in good voice. Some remakes of his classics hits, plus a few tunes I don't think he had previously recorded. Here's something to ponder: Amos Milburn has not been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, as an ""early influence"". Just one of many reasons why the so-called R&RHoF is such a crock of you-know-what!"
1,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"WOW! It's the Fast & the Furious on motorcycles! Torque is a ridiculous film from the producers of the Fast & the Furious, and it's basically the same movie except for a few key points. First they didn't have the budget of the Fast & the Furious which is evident by the stunts, which at times actually looked like a video game. I'm all for stunt men doing impossible things, and I don't mind good computer generated action either, however the CGI in Torque is just ridiculously bad, it is however nowhere near as bad as the acting. Instead of Vin Diesel and the dashing Paul Walker, the producers of this film settled for Ice Cube and some guy no one has ever heard of and trust me, the inexperience shows. This film is just as bad as all the other reviews say it is. Some poorly written, badly acted films, can be entertaining...Torque is not!"
1,This magazine does not exist any more !,"I have placed my order with Amazon on 27th of September 2008. It took until December 1st for the publisher to send me letter, informing me that they will not continue to publish the ""Coral"" magazine any more. A new magazine is in the works and will be available some time in spring 2009.They offered me to stick to the new magazine or to get a refund, which would be processed withtin 60 to 90 days. So all in all I have then given these guys a $40 credit for free for 6 months ?I had subscribed to the german magazine ""Koralle"" for years. ""Coral"" is the US version, they have reprinted the german version always a few quarters later. IMO ""Koralle"" is still one of the best magazines about reef keeping and marine aquariums and it's sad too see what happened to it here in the US...."
3,fine print,"""It doesn't work with AIM""So we haven't really had a chance to use this , because you can only use it with friends who have it or use girl tech im-me for texting, so if you want to buy it for all your friends at 60+ bucks a pop or if you can get all your friends to get one you'll be all set but if its only you it isn't good for anything."
2,Ugh!,"I bought this to see the dynamic Missy Elliott...and I got her, for half a disc. The videos featured herein are not her best, only ""The Rain,"" ""Sock It to Me,"" and ""Hit'em wit da Hee"" making it to the disc. None of the brilliance from 2001's ""So Addictive"" makes the DVD, not one. Considering this DVD was produced post-""The Cookbook""...I found this unacceptable. STAY AWAY...find the videos on YouTube and call it lovely."
4,Works,Product is great. Has a lot of outlets and I like how the spacing is for the bigger power adapters. Works as expected.
2,not impressed,"was not impressed at all by this product,very slow connection and won't work on wall sockets that are too far away from my xbox."
3,Almost a wireless replacement,It has a great concept for locations that does not have wireless installed. However in old officeas and homes that does not have power outlet make this product useless.
1,BEWARE!! This is only HALF the product you need!,"This product may work well, or it may not. I don't know, because the product on its own is useless -- you need to buy TWO to make it work: one to plug in the source connection (e.g. a router), and another to plug in the receiving connection (e.g. a computer). I assumed the kit would contain what's needed to make it useful, but no... there's only a single plug in the package!You'll be better off buying a competing product (e.g. a SlingLink Turbo) which contains both ends of the unit. Cheaper than buying two of these! Beware..."
5,Great Entertainment,"I really enjoyed this movie. I gave it 5 stars because I felt it delivered in allareas of entertainment. I don't see how it could have been any better. Acting andvisual effects, story-line, etc. was all excellent in my opinion."
3,Snow White and the Huntsman,It was ok. I think the evil queen (played by Charlize Theron) was over the top in acting evil..and the end of the movie totally SUCKED. Could they not think of words for the end? They said absolutely nothing..BAD way to end. We need closure.
1,Predictable and dulll.,"I have to admit I did like some of the visual effects of this movie, and, they did have a storyline closer to the one in the actual books, However, it was so predictable as to what is going to happen next it was sheer boring. Plus, they missed the whole boat with the whole romance thing. Anyway it was OK for the effects but I won't be watching this again."
2,OK AT BEST,"I got this thinking that it was going to be a really good movie and was very disappointed at the acting in this movie. I did like the special effects and did manage to finish the movie, but the story felt rushed, crammed and almost lost at times. Over all the movie is ok, at best it could get 3 stars... Not for me though."
2,snow white,"The movie was good, but they missed a ton of the original happenings of snow white, and there were only 2 kisses in this movie, and whats up with the ending, like you need more details people."
2,What a waste,"It really could have been a great movie, unfortunately Kristen Stewart ruins the movie. I felt like I was watching her ""act"" rather than believing she was Snow White."
5,Action Packed,"This movie was great. The wicked Queen was great and was easily hated, and it was easy to root for Snow and the huntsman."
3,"It's alright, nothing Epic","Ok, if you can imagine Lord of the Rings meeting Willow, except with a Trampire as the star, then you have it. It entertained me for almost 2 hours, good thing it's only $4."
4,Good. Worth seeing.,"We liked this movie a lot. Would have given it 4.5 stars if I could have. Not the very best movie I've ever seen, but I liked how they played off the original snow white story. Worth watching."
3,just ok...,"acting was poor - liked the story line, but the actors failed to deliver any real impact in my opinion"
3,This is one of those videos....,"...that make you ask yourself if you really need to own videos. I don't know why I bought this, but due to Amazon's clever marketing/packaging I got to watch the video on Amazon Instant Video first. Now this video is becoming a Christmas present for one of my nieces.It was a pretty good movie, and the title made it sound like an interesting twist on a familiar faerie tale. But I didn't think it was all that great. I'm just not into faerie tales. I thought it was appropriately acted, and the design/cinematography/cgi were all good, just not compelling.Just sayin......"
2,Not great,This was not a great pick. I felt Kristen Stewart was wooden. The plot dragged a bit. The whole gave me a yawn.
2,Meh,"The movie was decent for the first half, but I found the second half to be boring and drag on for way too long. This would have been far better if it was about half an hour shorter. Unfortunately the bulk of the plot and most of the important events of the film take place in the second half, so it's just kind of a disappointment. I was hoping for an exciting reinterpretation of this story, but this was not it."
2,Great costumes; suck-egg movie,"really pretty and excellent production values, but what a waste of time and plastic! Maybe it's just that the Twilight girl only has one facial expression -- and clueless-vacant doesn't get you very far in story-telling."
2,good work just not good movie,way to dark for my teens to watch. this movie is very gritty and not what i expecped. but as will all things it was made to keep you on the edge of your seat.
4,pretty good modern flick of a classic disney tale,"This is not your childs Disney movie for sure. But a more adult version of the classic snow white tail with a evil witch queen. Much more action then expected and good action at that. Special effects were good and not to over powering. All in all a good movie, not 5 stars but a solid 4 stars. Again its an adult version of a kids classic so one can't expect to much or can you?"
4,Good entertainment,I liked this movie! It kept my attention better than I though it would. Well acted and good action scenes. I feel like some of the script could have been fleshed out bit more but overall good entertainment!
3,Not bad different gritty,I liked the movie but it didn't hit with an oh wow since this movie was done over so many times but I was not terrible either. I recommend this to anyone who loves the story of Snow White
3,Better Than I Thought...,This movie surprised me by being quite a bit better than I thought it would be. The special effects were good and Charlize Theron was excellent as the Queen.
3,Worth watching,Wife liked it. I thought it was okay. It was worth watching though. Just not my cup of tea I guess.
3,Snow white?,Kristen Stewart in my opinion is the only bad thing about this movie. Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth are awesome. Good movie not great.
4,Entertaining with wonderful visual effects,"Entertaining movie with a decent cast (as usual, not overly impressed by Kristen Stewart). Visual effects were very nicely done."
2,Snow White & The Huntsman,"Plenty of eye-candy but that's about it. I did not enjoy this film. I typically enjoy Charlize Theron, but was a bit surprised to see her in this film... Not good."
2,Huntsman was ir really worth it?,"I never saw the movie in the theaters, but thought that a different version of Snow White would be a refreshing family movie. It was okay, but the acting was not up to par. When compared to Mirror Mirror which came out before this, I would was better than Snow White and the Huntsman. There is only one saving grace for this movie that it was not too violent to it makes for an okay family movie."
3,Pricey,The movie is godd but it was alot just for borowing it. I think what you guys should do is let people barrow it for a certain amount of days for free but if they go over that amount of days then you should start charging
4,great,its kinda dark but fanasy meets reality its crazy i liked it but i like lord of the rings and star wars so i loved it
1,A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"DISAPPOINTMENTWATCH IT FIRST , AND THEN DECIDE IF TO PURCHASE OR NOTTO MY OPINION: THE NATURE SCEENS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT IMPRESSIVE AND BEAUTIFULPOOR ACTING !VERY BAD ENDING TO MY OPINIONTHE MOVIE SHOULD ALSO HAVE MUCH MORE ROMANCE SCEENS AND FEELINGS , EMOTIONS , BUT IT'S NOT !THE SEVEN DAWRF - RIDICULES ! A JOKE !WHEN I WATCH A MOVIE , I WOULD EXPECT IN THE END TO FEEL - WOW .. IT WAS IMPRESSIVE ..BUT NOT THIS ONE!IT MAYBE START GOOD , AND THEN - GOING DOWNIN A WAY , I THINK I CAN COMPARE IT TO END OF THE MOVIE - THE EAGLE - WHICH ALSO HAS A BAD ENDING, AND ALSO WAS MADE BY UNIVERSAL STUDIO'S !IN FACT, BECAUSE OF THE BAD ENDING I AM NOT GOING TO PURCHASE THIS MOVIE !If we do not laugh, cry, get excited, as we watch the film, so what's the point ?A film with such an end ... Take the fun out of seeing it again ever !It seems that Universal Studios do not put an emphasis on the end of the filmThey finish the film quickly and pass to the next project.."
2,Nice visuals...,"and that's where the positives end. I can only assume Charlize Theron owed someone a favor, or perhaps has crippling gambling debts. Kristen Stewart is basically paid in this movie to stand and look at whomever is talking. She's effectively a soundboard off which the other actors bounce their lines. The only other positive is that this movie eventually ends.The special effects are nice, and some of the bit characters are fun (if predictable), but overall I'd give this a 1.5 if I could manage to figure out fractional star-ing. This movie is a great example of why a 10-point scale is needed. Five-point scales don't provide enough granularity."
2,Nice visuals but everything else falls short,"The visual style of the film was very well done and set up a nice scene to look at and imagine, but everything else fell short. Apart from Charlize Theron's performance being exceptional all of the actors were forced to work with a sub-par plot and weak direction. There is little character direction and what seems like it could be an interesting angle between the huntsman, the prince, and snow white is quickly hurried past to move the action along.In short, it looks good but you'll end up wishing you'd watched something better."
4,snow white is alright,"movie not too bad, it seems as thou it is missing something. i thought it needed more violence and better violence."
3,Drawn out..,"Not a bad movie, but very drawn out. Could easily have been condensed in to 30mins.There are may scenes in the middle of the movie that really serve no purpose and you willbe asking yourself why you are watching them. But otherwise ok."
4,Movie,"Mixed views in my family, We did enjoy it; everyone felt that it had great effects; Charlize Theron was great."
4,Theron Saves The Day,"Charlize makes this film work and that's why I original purchased it, being a fan or her work... and beauty. Theron's performance is wonderfully wicked and the special effects giving her an aged appearance really create a classic sense of gothic gloom. Stewart is decent, but ""fairest of them all""? I don't think so, she's a cute girl but not a classic beauty denoting purity and wonder... but it works overall. So far I've only watched the instant video version on my PS3 via the Amazon app, so it should be a drastic improvement visually when i get my Blu-ray order. The scope of the screenplay doesn't exceed the original tale, which is actually small in scope, so they did the best they could without adding completely foreign plot lines that would convolute the production... but it is a totally linear story experience that retains all we have come to know as Snow White. This movie sets along side Lord of the Rings etc, so in my opinion it's worth adding to the fantasy collection."
3,Different take on Snow White,"ok movie. Kristen Stewart did not add much to movie. Did like Chris Hemsworth character. I loved the fairies. Didn't care for the queen. She seemed pathetic, not evil. Maleficent in the Disney version was much better."
4,Surprisingly Good,"My expectations for this movie were not very high, but I thought it was very good.This was a fresh take on the classic tale, and they pulled it off. Overall it was well acted and nicely filmed. Better than most Hollywood fare these days."
1,A very boring movie,"The movie didn't pull me in, it didn't make me iterested in the characters or the story. Very boring....special effect alone do not carry a movie."
2,Misses the Mark,"A successful fantasy requires more than special effects, action, dwarves, white horses, evil villains and pretty women. I felt like the director really wanted this to be comparable to Lord of the Rings. It's so very much not. Without a good screenplay, the remaining elements are merely window dressing. This story was sloppy, flat, predictable, and tedious. The dramatic pans, sweeping landscapes and musical score couldn't prop up what simply wasn't there."
3,Not Great,"It was a fun film but not a great film. All of the old cliches were there, the dwarfs, the apple and the talking mirror. There was lots of action and it moved well. Even though it was not great, I did enjoy it."
4,Thematically Rich,"Though a grouchy, grumpy, or sleepy dwarf might give this film a mere average rating, this film deserves more than that. The two swords of darkness and hope intersect for this fairy tale to feel real...and yet surreal. All the magic is fantastical, but at times they go out of their way to explain how normal things can seem magical. In many ways they wrap messages that help cut to the core of their reality. Most interestingly, they come through with strong undertones that show the absurdity of the extreme feminist polarity by means of a female redeemer. Overall, very well thought out and intriguing for entertainment and analysis. However, the story did seemed a bit rushed at the end (thus 4 star)."
2,Glad I waited for video...,"It's too bad that Charlize Theron had to hold together the whole film, the rest of the crew was a pretty weak performance."
1,Stupid movie,"What a stupid boring movie! I barely made it to the end. It has no real story, no dialog, no character development. Nothing but special effects! A total waste of time"
3,"Vivid effects, choppy editing","The effects are dramatic and interesting to a degree, not frightening and lack some of the symbolism they could have added without much expense. The editing is choppy and leaves many characters limited in description and depth. Too bad, for the actors are good and deserve better. Best thing I can say of the film is that the strongest and most layered characters are the leading women."
3,Snow White and Hollywood,"It is amazing what Hollywood will and can do to normally innocent and adorable subject. I, for one, prefer the original story.Snow White and the Huntsman (Extended Edition)"
2,Disappointed,Too long and boring. I was looking forward to seeing this and it was not what I expected. My son and I are into fantasy and sci-fi movies. He fell asleep !
2,disapointing,"I bought the DVD version and could not see the whole movie. The movie runs well for a while then stops and goes back to scenes already seen. So I tried to fast forward on the scenes that jump back but instead I end up skipping other scenes. So, I guess I will end up renting it at a video store."
4,The Real Story,Certainly not for kids but likely closer to how it was originally told. Somewhat dark at times but the visuals were done well. Worth watching.
2,Tortured dialog,"If you like special effects there is something in this film for you. The casting choices are strange, the performances somewhat stiff. Some of the lines they say made me wince. I was embarassed for them"
4,Snow White and teh Huntsman,"This is a very good movie. It kept my interest through most of the movie, there were some slow periods however. I reccomend this movie."
1,not good,"Dont to it. Even if it is free, I am sure you could find better things to do with your time."
4,Inspired by Lord of the Rings?,"The setting and feel of this movie reminded me a bit of Peter Jackson's treatment of Lord of the Rings. The scenery was fantastic. It is an interesting take on the Snow White tale. Kristen Stewart as Snow White, although obviously central to the story, didn't have much of a speaking part. The evil queen and her back story are what really make this film worth seeing."
4,Kristen Is OK by me,Why is everyone dumping on Kristen Stewart? Sure she started in some pretty corny teen movies about vampires with bulging pecs etc etc but she has grown as an actress in my opinion and I think her performance was quite believable within the realms of the story being told here.
4,wonderful movie,"This was a wonderful adaptation of the Snow White story, I watched it 4 times. I would give it a two thumbs up! way....up."
3,At least it's 7.1,"Charlize Theron screams instead of acts. Kristen Stewart can't scream or act. The DI-REC-TOR wishes he was in New Zealand with Hobbits and tried to CGI button push his way there when he should be at an intersection with white gloves and a whistle. I don't know who Chris Hemsworth is and fell asleep for fifteen minutes in the middle. If that makes this review incomplete, I apologize. Now let me get back to The Bowery Boys Volume One recently released by Warners. At least they knew how to do something consistent for twenty years!"
2,Snow White & the Huntsman - I want my 99 cents back,"Waste of a buck. Ridiculous juvenile plot, lousy acting (especially Snow White). Although the wicked queen was pretty good. Mediocre special effects. Not worth a lengthy review, there are plenty here to choose from. Save your $$$ and spend it on ""Lawless""."
3,Amazing design limited characters,The movie would have been better served with a lead who more effectively emotes. Kritian Stewert sadly isn't a fantastic actor. The sets and costume design were amazing.
3,Eh,"I like Kristen Stewart but in this movie, they could of done so much better with another actress in her place"
3,Powerful Snow White Tale,"Good and entertaining movie, also an interesting, fresh take on the Snow White tale. However the ending made me forget I really enjoyed it while I was watching it...."
3,Decent movie for a night with nothing to do.,"I rented the movie just for a weekend night with nothing going on. It was probably worth the $3 I paid to rent, but I wouldn't have any desire to see it again. Chris Hemsworth obviously did a fantastic job. Everyone else is so-so. The queen was a little over the top, and everyone bashed on Kristen's performance as Snow White. I honestly did think she was all that bad. Definitely could have had more lines as the lead role, but nothing was bad about her acting. All in all an ok movie with nothing to do. Worth the $3 to rent"
3,Great effects but weak acting,"The movie displays some great special effects, but the acting is weak and the plot very predictable. The story winds aimlessly without a clear direction or intention."
3,Intersting Plot,"I felt this movie was an interesting take on the Snow White story, but Kristen Stewart almost ruined it. The rest of the movie was entertaining though so I gave it three stars."
3,"Not Bad; Charlize Theron Is Awesome, As Usual","The movie was kinda slow and plodding, but the special effects helped keep it moving along. Probably best to wait for this to come to a subscription streaming service (Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc)"
2,Fairytale Fail!,I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't get past Kristen Stewart's awful acting and the substandard plot. Chris Hensworth manages to carry a good deal of the movie but he couldn't carry a crazy script and an unlikeable leading lady. It was visually stunning but the rest fell short in execution. This movie bit off more than it could chew and suffered greatly for it.
3,meh,I found myself a little bored and playing on my phone rather than watching the movie. Visually a great movie but found the story line a little predictable but I guess that's because of the fairy tale simularity
3,Just an ok movie,Special effects were good.. Charleze Theron was great! I just was not that satisfied with it.. Overall it was just an ok movie!
4,Pleasantly surprised,"Stewart did much better than I expected. I was expecting a Natalie-Portman-In-Star-Wars debacle (Natalie couldn't hold her prop gun convincingly; let alone act). But she brought the right amount of angst to the character to be convincing.Meanwhile, the show belonged to Charlize Theron. To paraphrase one of her lines, she was the queen that wretched world deserved. Terribly beautiful, miserable and bitter, hate-filled and constantly scanning for the fairest one who could break her power. I really enjoyed this interpretation of the queen.Over-all, pleasantly surprised!"
3,She Cant Act,"Snow white cannot act. The effects are really cool and the story has a cool twist, but whatsherface just can't act. Couldn't act in Twilight either."
2,Waste of potential...,"Well, here are the details:- Kristen Stewart was poorly cast for the role and might be the most overrated actress of our time. She carries no gravity, and was utterly uncompelling in this film.- Chris Hemsworth has the acting chops and the look, but the poor script made his lines sound flat, forced, and at times, a little hokey.- Charlize Theron was superb, and yet underused, leaving her character painfully unrealized.- The writers didn't seem to know how to end it, leaving you with an anticlimactic ending.- Whatever you do, do not view this within a year of watching The Lord Of The Rings. Actually, don't bother viewing it at all."
1,snow white an the huntsman,I never got it I paid for the movie but never came in the mail so please redeem my money or send me the movie
2,"Ok, but not great","Watched it all, but was not that crazy about it, and I usually like movies of this type, but maybe it just wasn't my night for the movies."
3,snowhite,It wasn't as good as I hope but it was still entertaining Charlize played a good witch and some of the special effects were good as well.
1,Snow white and the Huntsman,"This movie sucks, do not buy it. I would never listen to the pumped up adds again. Don't buy this movie."
2,Really?,Really? Really? Really? The extended edition is only 4 minutes longer? Really? Really? Really? Why pay more for only 4 minutes? Really?
4,Snow White and the Huntsman,"What an interesting twist on an established Fairy tale. If it's one thing I have always been inpressed with is, originality, and for me this one hits the mark . However ,make no mistake this tale is not for children of a young age, it's dark and bruding at times. The acting is great and there are some outstanding spectacular visual effects. If I could tweek it a bit,I might just make it a bit shorter.To sum it up,I must say I really enjoyed it."
2,My God - simply aweful! Except Ms. Theron!,"Charlize Theron is stunning and beautiful, she was the only reason I watched this movie. Other than her...this movie is terrible."
3,Not What I thought,"THE MOVIE WAS NOT BAD, BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LONGER AND HAD MORE ACTION. THE MAIN ACTRESSES WERE VERY GOOD. MAYBE THEY SHOULD BRING OUT PART 2 WITH MORE MAGIC SPELLS AND MYSTERY."
4,I like the actress of the queen,"I would say that she is the main reason that I gave a 4 stars. I forgot snow white's name, but I think she still has some space to improve in terms of acting skills."
1,Terrible,This movie wandered all over. It definitely didn't hold my interest. Buyer beware. I don't usually rate movies but wanted to help out in this case.
2,"Eh, I've Seen Better Movies","I liked Charlize's character, but was bored with the other cast members. I think that I fell asleep during the movie."
1,"They should burn every copy of this movie, even the digital ones.","This movie was horrible. The acting was horrible. The story was horrible. The ending was horrible. It was like they gave 30% effort into making this movie. The ""actress"" that plays Snow White has no emotions except blah. Yes I know her name, but typing it makes me angry at this movie. Charlize Theron who is a great actress must have been quite drunk/drugged when she agreed to help make this steam pile."
2,sandmansays,"Snow white and the Huntsman is a perfect example when hollywood runs out of projects, The storyline is not the best it could have been. Kristen played her part well but you find yourself wanting the movie to end."
1,Ruined by Kristen Stewart,This movie was ruined by the bad acting of Kristen Stewart. My wife and I both felt that way after seeing it at the theater. If they had a different Snow White this would have been a good movie. The scene where she gives a speech to rally the troops was the worst acting I have ever seen. She has no emotion. I wonder if she is a zombie? Charlize Theron was amazing as the evil queen and the rest of the cast was good but they can't overcome Kristen Stewart's poor acting. Save your money and buy anything else.
4,Decent,Enjoyed this rendition of a classic. Was a little hard to follow in parts but other wise good. Will watch again.
4,I like it!,This was a good movie. I enjoyed it. I love Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron. It had good special effects and the story kept my interest.
2,Very disappointing,"It just drug on, and on, and on. There was so much potential for the story to get good, so I hung in there till the end, but it never did get good."
2,I give the trailer 5 stars. The movie 2 stars.,"The trailer made it look like a great movie. But it never got off the ground. When it ended, it left no thoughtful perspectives, no lingering emotions... nothing. A walk thru an uninspiring landscape."
2,Not That Good,"This movie was not nearly as good as I hoped it would be. Had some intertesting characters and special effects but I never really ""got into"" the movie."
5,Good movie!,"I liked the trailer, I liked the entire movie. I am not one to watch a movie more than one time, but I would watch this one again."
2,Snow White and the Huntsman,"This movie was bad enough but when you throw in Kristen Stewart it is almost unbearable to watch. Would not recommend, this is two hours of my life I wasted!"
5,Awesome,"It was a really good movie to watch. I should have bought it, but I wanted to see it first. I'll buy it as a combo deal."
2,So-so,"Okay to rent if you have seen everything else. As Dorothy Parker once said about another actress, and which I will paraphrase and adapt,""Stewart runs the gamut of emotions from A to B."" She brought the rest of the movie down to her own deadpan level. There was almost zero chemistry between her and Hemsworth. Charlize Theron, as far as she was able to, added to the overall movie, but she can't do it alone."
4,They're making a sequel.,"Ms. Stewart can't act very well,but thank goodness the others can. Hollywood needs to come up with new ideas for a movie. It's remake after remake."
3,OK Movie,"OK...better than I expected after movie reviews. Parts of it dragged, but the action sequences and special effects were pretty good."
3,Snow & huntsman,Effects are very interesting but story development and acting are off. I just never got the sense that Snow White was a person of character that justified everyone's devotion.
3,Champ,"It's ok. Storyline too predictable visual effect average, and the end was kind of a let down, I would only rent this if you really love the story."
2,Stewart is barfable,"Charlize Theron was visually brilliant as the evil queen and Chris Hemsworth was, well, Chris Hemsworth, wonderful visually and acting - the movie could have been about the two of them and been fantastic, but no, they had to have Kristin Stewart play Snow White... correct me if I am wrong, but I don't remember the character being a vacuous twit who appears to want to catch flies with her constantly opened-mouth expressionless face. Gawd, she was awful. It even feels as if the film has been cut to try to eliminate as many scenes with her as possible... they didn't eliminate enough."
3,Expected better,"A potentially good idea for a story, that was not developed well enough. The characters were not that compelling, and did not earn my emotional connection. The evil witch was just that, a rather flat character, that seemed to be irritated by being in the movie at all."
2,TOO MUCH,Well made....but leave kid's stuff to the kids. Leave the Snow White story alone. We feel the story should remain animated.
2,Disappointing,"Watched about 45 minutes (rented on my Kindle Fire), wound up not finishing it.The special effects were great, and the camera work. Everything else, and particularly the script, sucked, to me. Some of the acting was alright, but honestly they weren't given much to go by.It definitely strove to be a ""fresh"" retelling of the story, and succeeded to some degree, but I felt like the things they added to make it more ""unique"" wound up just being more clichés that were just new to Snow White, rather than genuine innovative. I felt like I was painfully aware of how much they're ""trying"" to be something different."
2,Fell asleep,"This movie had promise, but I couldn't even stay awake through the whole thing. Complete lack of interest in the story and how it would end (which was beyond obviously predictable). Boring."
2,Bad movie,Completely forgettable. I didn't care about the characters or their motivations. I can't take Kristen Stewart seriously either. It was hard not to laugh during her motivational speech.
2,Couldn't Get thru it,Scenery was very pretty and effects were cool. But I found the acting a bit corny and I fell asleep. MIght be better for a younger (10-16) audience.
3,"Okay movie, but I wouldn't watch it again.","Kristen Stewart just cannot keep her own sullen mopey personality from showing through in her acting. I thought she might do a better job than the Twilight movies, but alas, it's the same. The only saving grace to this movie was Charlize Theron who turned in a great performance as the wicked queen."
3,Poor execution,"I'm a kind of big fan of Si-Fi or fantasy movie. Well, this movie looks like such an interesting movie but it was not mine. I like the idea how the mirror says to the queen but that's all I like. It could be more attractive. Poor execution I think."
4,Watch it for Chris & Charlize,"What is it about Kristin Stewart that is so annoying? She's just always making that same face in every movie. Charlize Theron and Chris Helmsworth do a superb job in this flick, making it worth watching."
3,Too much of a spin on a classic,This moive had too much of a spin on a classic for my taste. It strayed way too far from what we ever grew up knowing about Snow White. My husband liked it though.
4,Great service !!!,"Good Movie, Great cinama photogerphy , Kristen Stewart is no acadamy award winner but does a fine job in this movie"
3,Interesting Movie,The movie & plot was good. I only wish that the studios wouldn't film in such dark settings. I find it difficult to distinguish the characters from the dark settings.
1,Total Garbage Folks!,"This film is so dreadful that I cannot even find the words (w/o getting tossed off amazon). No story,worst acting. This is why Hollywood has no clue. This film is as bad as ""Avatar"", and that is saying a lot! Kristen Stewart had better start thinking about saving her career. Kristen was excellent in ""The Runaways"", so we know she can act. But, after being in many of the worst and most successful films (Twilight Franchise and This THING), I think I have made my point. Hollywood is clueless and sadly is the audience. This film is for a blind 3 year old child."
2,Blah,"OK. Little gorey. I had a friend of mine that loved this movie, but it was not so great for me even though I normally like this kind of movie."
1,Poor story,Not well written and poorly acted movie that has some cool special effects though. However that does not make up for the lack of meaning.
1,Boring,That chick cant act her way out of a bag....dialogue was horrible....boring movie overall. Expected more action then there was. Movie idea had potential but epic fail ensued.
2,Confused and Overwrought,This movie wasn't very good because it tried too hard to follow the Disney version while crafting this weird narrative that was never explained. It was confusing and it really dragged during the middle and end.
2,Just Okay,"The movie starts off well, but clearly begins to lag as Kristen Stewart becomes the focal point. The scenes with Charlize as the Queen are the most intriguing part of the movie and she clearly steals the film. In the middle where she is absent for large gaps, the movie drags."
1,A Wast of Time,I didn't expect much due to the reviews but I at least thought it would be visually interesting. A lackluster boring waste of time.
4,New Snow White,Liked the new version of the old tale! The queen to me was a much stronger character than snow white. I also loved the broader roll for the dwarfs.
3,only so so,I'm wondering why the producer chose Christen Stewer. She is not so not Snow White type of girl. Her acting skill is not that impressive either
4,Great Costuming OK Movie!,"This movie was pretty good, carried solely on the performances of Hemsworth and Theron. For a costume buff like myself, this movie was simply outstanding. The dresses (one made up of thousands of beetle wings) make this movie a visual stunner--making up for its lackluster plot."
5,Great!!,Do not listen to the other reviews that are stating that this movie is bad because it isn't at all!! I loved this movie I even went and saw it twice in the theater :) If you are not confident with what I say rent the movie first and then buy it :D
2,Decent,"It's really rare that I dislike a movie. But I got bored in the theater, wondering when it would be over."
1,KRISTEN IS AT ONCE BOTH ZOMBIE LIKE AND TWITCHY!,"HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO SEEM ANESTHETIZED AND TWITCHY AT THE SAME TIME? KRISTEN STEWART SEEMS INCAPEABLE OF SHOWING ANY REAL OR DEEP EMOTIION (ON SCREEN AT LEAST).THE TWILIGHT SERIES TOOK ON A LIFE OF IT'S OWN DUE TO STELLAR PERFORMANCES BY PETER FACINELLI,ROBERT PATTISON, TAYLOR LAUTNER AND ASHLEY GREEN AS WELL AS NIKKI REED.KRISTEN STEWART BASICALLY TWITCHED AND MUMBLED THROUGH ALL THE TWILIGHT MOVIES. WE NOW HAVE TO SUFER THROUGH ANOTHER LACKLUSTER PERFORMANCE BY MISS STEWART IN SNOW WHITE/ SAVE YOUR MONEY BUY ""SWEET NOVEMBER"" TO SEE CHARLIZE THERON AT HER MOST ADORABLE AND RADIANT.BUY A CHRIS HEMSWORTH POSTER.BUY ""MONSTER"" WITH CHARLIZE TO SEE SOME REAL ACTING ,KRISTEN! ( I GOTTA TAKE THIS EASY SHOT, SORRY) STOP SLEEPING WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S HUSBANDS AND USE YOUR TIME MORE WISELY-AS IN TAKING SOME ACTING LESSONS."
5,Wonderful,"I bought one of these last year for my g. daughter, worked great outside, it was everyone's favorite Christmas present. Liked it so much I bought one for myself this year, have not stopped except to charge it, eat and sleep...(almost) Very simple to operate, you can't steer it, but it tends to move in diff. directions, so you keep on your toes w/ the hover. Just takes 10 min. to recharge, runs non-stop about 10 mins. Charge it all the way first(in other words, read the directions). Be careful about banging it into concrete, etc., it's basically styrofoam and will break if stepped on. It's lo tech (hooray), cheap, and a ton of fun, flies about 30-50 ft straight up (got it stuck in a tree) outside, need a little room to use indoors, just be careful, let mom or dad familiarize w/ it before turning loose on your kid. For cost and fun, challenge, I would rate this gizmo a def. 5 stars. Going to check into their other products."
4,Great Gift,"It's a great gift. Another great gift idea from Amazon. I haven't actually seen the product, but have been told that it was fantastic. Delivery was fast, and the sister liked it, what else can I say?"
2,"Good for ideas, bad to run","Very little information provided on NPC's and monsters. You have to look up EVERYTHING! Which makes game time real slow. Also, Gather information checks are HIGH, bring your bards! Rather tough battles, HIGHLY confusing for characters to run through. Mine kept looking for a missing town guard, which was a complete waste of gametime. My main gripe was the complate lack of information on monsters/NPC's, and no place provided in the book to write in what you need when you game."
5,Beautiful in Every WAy,"This is a beautiful story: beautifully told, beautifully written, beautifully felt. It deals with hardship, separation, and reaching out to another. And gardening. And frowns. And smiles. Most importantly, it's about love."
3,seems not work for me,"As different kinds of ance caused by different reasons, no drugs or anything else could be useful for every people. It could make face feel cool, but seems not work for me."
5,Absolutely Stunning Album,"Crypt of... is a compilation of out of print 12""singles and brings Mortiis at his best. this time more varied stuff than the usual Dark ambient monotonous material of his earlier works.There is more emphasis on drum patterns.The music is Stunning if you`re not familiar with his work . I suggestt you get this one first ,then i`m sure you`ll be seduced by the atmospheres conjured by this Dark Lord. HAIL MORTIIS"
4,cant go wrong,"At the time of this writing, there was no photo for the item. I took a chance. It was the least expensive. Its fine. It came quickly, and was exactly what I expected. 24mm with a 1/2"" (fits the largest of my 3 handles of my Craftsman set) You can't go wrong."
5,A new approach to emerging concepts in autoimmunity,"This textbook, edited by Robert Lahita MD of Lupus textbook fame is a different approach to autoimmune diseases. The first part of the book offers an overview of the main aspects of immune response in basic science, while part 2 deals with the clinical aspects of autoimmunity.After that he dedicates 12 chapters to approaching the autoimmune diseases by the organ that they act upon. The rest of the book deals with autoimmunity in the old-fashioned way, that is, by specific pathological entities. Lahita ando co-editors deal with autoimmunity in a modern fashion, eliminating ancestral concepts such as self and non-self and establishing the terms antigen, epitope and response as the words that will guide research into these disease throughout this new century. In all, a defininitive, new approach to these emerging concepts, so important in modern medicine."
4,"Lovely Wayne,","""Music is a drop of water, in the ocean of life."" When Wayne Shorter makes a statement like that - it says something to me, as a musician and as a human being. This is a fab story of a difficult but rewarding life. All ends well. Wayne is an enigma. Highly enjoyable."
4,Great reception but lack Noise reduction,"I have this product for about 6 months now and I am impressed by the sound quality and battery life. The battery on average last you 2-3 days if you used it to talk for 3-4 hours per day. The only complain I have is winds noise. If you use this headset outdoor with just a small breeze, it would sound like you are in a wind tunnel. You can't walk and talk outdoor due to winds noise. Aside from that, this is a good product. The rubber earpiece will fall off, but Tekkeon is kindly enough to send you a replacement for free (Thank you Anna!!!)."
5,Perfect complement for a cell phone.,"I bought this only after reading several reviews about its great reception. Reception is fantastic with my Motorola RAZR, and people don't even know when I move from my house to my noisy pickup.With the right earpiece adapter, I can hardly feel it on my ear. Man, I thought the Motorola's speakerphone was cool - my sweetie can't tell when I'm on speaker or on Bluetooth.It's light weight undoubtedly indicates fragility. And I could live without the blue indicator light blinking when I wear it in public. But overall, this was a great investment, doubling the usefullness of my cell phone."
4,Trapped under the Doobie spell,"This is an excellent dvd. At first, it went a little more towards their new stuff, than it ended up finishing with that good ole Doobie style. It is a must see!!!!!!!"
4,Good Tunes!,Classic Doobies. Fun to watch. You'll miss Michael McDonald. His absence is noticed. It's still great music. Terrific quality.
2,"Great for fruit chutneys, jams, and jellies","This was a disappointment for me, as I was hoping to learn about canning the harvest of my garden. It has very little to do with vegetables. It is primarily focused on fruit-based products. I think it would be a great book if that's what you're interested in. But, please choose another book if you're looking for tomato, bean, and basic vegetable recipes."
2,damaged,"at least 4 of the episodes stick and freeze while watching them, not very happy about that! what shiould i do"
4,The book of Prophecy??,"If you believe in Nostradamus or just like to read about this subject, you will find the book interesting."
1,the worst...,not a good Beethoven one at all. Purchased because Cesar Milan was supposed to be in it and he has one or two lines that look so stilted and one that looks like he is talking to himself with a green screen so the other actor can be put in later. a real disappointment for a film in any case.
4,All but the cost of film,I own this camera and I love it. The only problem is the cost of the film which makes this great little camera almost useless because I can hardly justify paying 50 dollars for 10 pictures. Bummer
3,Beeview,"Its not that bad, but he is clearly a beginner himself. IF your just getting started its worth a look, but if you have already read a few books, your not going to learn a lot. He does have one guest that is very knowledgeable, and basically saves the whole movie for the trash."
1,Don't use it to study for 642-831 exam,This book is totally out of sync with actual CIT exam questions. It is missing two major topics covered in the exam questions: documentation and baseline of network and end-systems.Get Sybex CIT book or Cisco CIT examination guide.
1,I'm back to a bic,I was hoping that the wet/dry functionality would let this razor get a closer shave but I was sorely disappointed. I'm back to using a disposable razor.
1,Power Failed,"Electronics failed in 8 months. No power just a clicking noise from the shaver.Also very hard to clean, not quick or easy to clean.Did not shave very well on the contours of the face or the neck."
2,Dissapointing shave,"I tried using this for about six weeks before giving up. I hope that I can still return it. It just doesn't get nearly as close as a blade. With all the hype, I thought I'd try the Panasonic. I used it wet, in the shower, with shaving gel, as recommended. I'd always come out with stubble on my neck."
4,Ron's review,"This is my third Panasonic wet/dry shaver. I am very pleased with the improvements! It slides so comfortably and shaves real close. I have very sensitive skin and this is the perfect way for me to shave. It charges in less than an hour and works whether my face is wet or dry. A real plus for me since I sweat at the gym and I like to use it there. I would recommend it to all of you whould also want use it for this purpose. The only complaint is that there is no real carrying case, but a velvety string bag that comes with it. That's why it gets a 4 and not a 5 star..."
1,"So, what is on it????","I'd surely be interested in this item if there was an idea or listing of what the songs are! Where in the world is the ""detail"" about this CD, other than, ""12 Songs of Healing, Comfort and Faith""??????????"
4,Herb Alpert,"I listen to Herb Alpert as a ""sweet trip to past time"". I like it, even if the same ""past life"" wasn't ""so good"" at least..."
2,Disappointed,"I had four or five of the Tijuana Brass albums on vinyl and really enjoyed them. I have Alpert's CD Rise, which I love. While I enjoy the jazz of Second Wind, I don't care for the muted trumpet which Alpert plays on most, if not all, of the songs (not all the way through the songs, but on significatnt portions of them). I don't mind a muted trumpet in a big band arrangement, but in a small combo setting when it is essentially a solo instrument, I don't find it very appealing. This is my personal taste, so if you don't mind the muted trumpet, and you like jazz, I think you might really enjoy this album."
5,Ariadne's Thread a Workbook of Goddess Magic,"What a wonderful book for those who want to learn more about the craft, whether solitary or part of a coven, or getting ready to teach. It takes you through the year with lessons, projects, rituals and many other things that keep you on the path. It follows the Dianic tradition, which does not include men in ritual, but provides a solid base for practicing love of the Goddess. I highly recommend it to both Dianic and other practicioners."
1,A waste of time and money,"Despite all of the good reviews about this book, I think that it is just what the title says! If you are looking for a man-hating, wiccan book then go for it! It disturbed me when She was talking about the chalice of your menstrual blood on the altar, and the part about all of the lesbian sex. I have nothing against that kinda stuff, but it wasnt what I was looking for. I do, however, give her a one star because she had the effort to actually put the book in print. You can find better books...I would recommend the book ""Avalon Within"" or almost any other Goddess book. Just be careful with Goddess spiritulity books, alot of them are all the same. This one is no different from any other one!!!!!!"
2,Not Durable,"I was disappointed with this bedding. It was beautiful, but the comforter got dirty very quickly, as it is white, but it is dry clean only which is a pain. Also, the ribbons constantly snag and tear. We also have several places where the seam on the comforter has come apart. This is all just from normal use. This would be great for a guest room or something where it wouldn't get used very often, but for daily use, I don't recommend it."
4,For anyone who is considering moving to Europe,"This is an excellent book written by a gay liberal, of all things. There is a lot of people who think Europe is a paradise but if they read this book they would be very dissapointed. I'm not going to talk about various politically correct crap that Europe is peddling while screaming that they are the only democracy on the planet. Read this book for yourself and you will be appalled."
1,Based On Author's Barroom Debates--So It Must Be True!,"This book will alarm people, but it should be doubted because the author cites as evidence... his conversations in bars with Europeans, and his own bad experiences with Muslims in Europe. He was walking down a dark street in Amsterdam and some teenager tried to mug him? It's bad, but it's not evidence that all of Europe will be turned upside down. Bruce Bawer should relax and have some kebab. It's delicious.No footnotes, no endnotes, no bibliography--moreover, Bawer routinely paints the secular Baathist Saddam Hussein as part of the Islamist movement. Yes, Bawer was one of those clear thinkers who thought that because extremist Egyptians and Saudis attacked NYC, the US had to overthrow a secular government in Iraq.How'd that work out?"
1,Totally irrational,"The book tackles the important and complex issue of the underclass immigrant communities in Europe. Some of these communities (Muslim, Christian, animists, etc..) have serious financial, social, and educational problems that need to be resolved in order for these millions to assimilate well in their respective societies.Instead of tackling the historical background of the problem that dates to colonial times, societal prejudice against immigrants in Europe, or government policies that encourage the ghettoization of these communities, the author chooses to attribute all these problems to the religion of some of these immigrants!This bizzare approach which contradicts every rule of rational analysis exploits the fear and ignorance that the layman have regarding Islam to sell an otherwise ridiculous argument."
5,A must reading for every US citizen,This book is very enlightening as to the current status of Western Europe. Most Americans lack this perspective of excessive dependency and too many want to emulate the European form of government. I appreciate the author's insights and first hand experiences.
3,"I believe the premise of this book is correct, but...","I believe the premise of this book is correct, but... The reviewer Milton Garber is absolutely right. When making a case for so important a subject, you MUST 'do your homework.' By which I mean find facts and figures and avoid using too much anecdotal evidence. Anecdotes are fantasti ways to explain a point, but cannot be used as the basis of a book.I have not heard of the book or author Mr. Garber mentions. I would recommend Bernard Lewis as a starting point for knowledge re Islam and it's relationship with the West."
4,Larry's Cookin!,Great vocals and a nice tribute to Sam Cooke. Larry sounds as if he was really there back in the day singing on the corner with the likes of Cooke.
2,An admirable Attempt,"Larry has a fine voice.But in comparison to theLATE GREAT SAM COOKE? Well,.. go check out theoriginal and YOU be the judge.But all in alla worthy effort in keeping that Soul SingingTradition alive."
5,What a great book!,"I received this book and think it's great! Thanks loads!!Congratulations on a product that's certain to help a lot of government employees succeed where otherwise they might not. Having served on numerous selection panels in the past, I often wondered why so many employees ""missed the boat"" on putting together a ""sellable"" application. Now, that shouldn't happen anymore. R, Don"
1,sent wrong item,"While for the most part, I have received nothing but the best quality of products when ordering from Amazon.com,however, I placed 2 different orders for The Horse Whisperer Original Score by Thomas Newman and both times received The Horse Whisperer: Songs from and Inspired By The Motion Picture (Various Country Artists). I did receive a refund for the purchases but I'm still a little disappointed that I can't seem to get the Original Score that I have wanted for quite some time. While I will still order products from Amazon.com I will always be a little anxious that I will be getting the correct product. Thank you for refunding the money for the the purchase so promptly, that shows good customer relations. Thanks, Michael Farish"
2,"Inspired By The Movie, Perhaps -- But Not From It","While fans of traditional and contemporary country and western music may appreciate the album, the music was a substantial departure from that performed in the movie. The album includes none of the beautiful instrumental -- some would say ""New Age"" -- music featured with Montana as the backdrop. Anyone wishing to acquire this album would do well to head this advice: Find a store that will let you listen before you buy. What you heard isn't what you'll get."
1,Major disappointment,"Goodbye and 10,000 HZ Legend by Air have a lot in common. Both were albums where the artist was in the process of changing their musical styles and both are complete failures. You will find a difficult time listening to the whole album without pressing the next button. If you are curious about this album don't buy it new. There will be plenty of them in the bargain bins. A major disappointment."
5,Great!,"As with all Ulrich Schauss music, this is excellent. But it does not live up to the high quality of Far Away Train Passing By. If you like this type of music however, you should own this album."
2,TOO MANY ADVERBS,"Plot: fairWriting: poorPace: slowLay off the lazy adverbs, its amateur writing. Prose like ""he coldly watched"" is just awful. In a single paragraph, of four sentences, I counted four adverbs. Where was the editor?The storyline was too slow, then he heaped on the blood and guts around page 260. He went for the gross out effect from that point to the end. I almost didn't finish this book, but I pushed ahead. I'm glad it's over."
2,"I love this kind of stuff, but ...","I absolutely love books that deal with devils, Satan, black magic, etc, etc, but ... this certainly wasn't my cup of tea. I struggled getting the last 100 pages read. I hope Michael's next book is MUCH better.-- review from the author of The Shadow God and Spiritual Sorrow."
3,Review,"It felt a little cheap and the clasp I think could have been made better; was hard to get on and off, but overall very cute and very nice. I really liked it and I might buy another one as a gift."
1,junk,"It broke into little bits, stuff from the 99 cent store last longer, I am mad about this is was for my little sis who likes these type of things."
5,The perfect book for starting out.,"I work in a teacher education program and have just used this text in a course on biography. Rollyson's writing is lively and clear. His clarity of expression and the book's modest length make it the perfect introduction for students who cannot remember having read a biography.The book served two purposes. First, it supplemented the biographies that were assigned, giving the students the lay of the land. Second, the chapters do not merely summarize biographies but highlight issues in the theory and practice of the genre; thus, the book was a starting point for many interesting class discussions and encouraged critical thinking.Highly recommended to teachers, students, and others who enjoy reading with eyes wide open."
4,Never knew it existed!,"My son, a true Hardy Boys fanatic, absolutely loved this DVD! It is the only adaptation that works (remember the to-be-forgotten teen-heartthrob's version from the 70's?...then again, don't). The only problem I had was listening to the intro before EVERY episode (I have a bad memory, but I have got that song nailed now). That's why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. A must have for true Hardy Boys accolites."
5,it made me cry,"wow, this dvd sure brought back some old memories to these 62 year old eyes i have not seen these episodes in over 50 years, i watched the mickey mouse club after school nearly every night on our old 19 inch philco black and white tv.it was great to see them again..."
5,To be young again . . . . just for a brief moment!!!,"As I watched these Hardy Boys serial episodes, my mind found me firming planted on the floor behind the living room coffee table, patiently waiting for my Mother and the arrival of my favorite peanut butter and jelly sandwich, a cold glass of milk and hopefully, several delightful Oreo cookies.This was my after-school ritual while I waited in anticipation for the next suspenseful Hardy Boys edition.After 50+ years without, I was as entertained today as I was back then! Walt Disney is to be commended for the quality and timeless efforts featured in this mini-series. A must see for all generations!!!"
2,This stuff is horrible,"the ""clean burst"" on this floss is really little waxy flavored flakes that come off on your hands & teeth. it turns into a slimy mush on the floss as you are trying to floss your teeth, making it unable to get a good grip on the floss. do not recommend.i only gave it 2 stars because it still works as floss if you're in a pinch."
1,Read Customer Reviews before buying,"If I had read even the first two or three reviews I would have known this was not the book for me. The trouble was, I loved the title"" How to do everything in Paint Shop Pro 8.0. It has been suggested that a better title would have been ""How to do a few limited photographic things in PSP8.0. Paint Shop Pro will allow you to place Text on a Path, Convert it to curves, fill with patterns, work in layers, create scripts when dealing with multiple graphics, and lets you build and save your own brushs and Tubes. These are all covered in the manual that comes with PSP. Alas, all this book will teach you is how to get the red out of someone's eye ... which is far too basic for most Paint Shop Pro users."
3,Everything?,"This book is supposed to show you how to do image editing with Paint Shop Pro 8. However, the book lacks because it would have been helpful to have access to the same photos used in the book so you could compare your results. It appears you are to use your own images and hope you get similar results....Plus there is my standard complaint for computer training books/guides...why doesn't someone use a spiral bound system so it can lay flat while working on the computer? Not rocket science here."
4,They opened for Live in 1997,"Luckily found these guys at Hershey Park on a summer evening opening for hometown heroes ""Live"". Ready or Not and Kop Karma are the best from a 'jump around' hip hop perspective -- but the rest plays with electronica, funk, and other themes. Whole album is great..."
2,Not very good,If you want to watch this because hottie Eva Longoria is in it and you are hoping to see her in some kick butt action scenes then dont bother because she doesnt do any of it. She is in the movie for maybe like 15min and her character is unnecessary. Keifer Sutherland is playing Jack Bauer again basically but doesnt get to beat anyone up. Oh and the movie overall is pretty dumb. The President is like this pansy guy who is being targeted but what doesnt make sense is why Douglas's character doesnt just turn himself in in the first 10 min to avoid a lot of people being killed and destruction of public/government property. This is a dumb movie and the action sequences dont make up for it.
4,Better Than Average,"There are so many mediocre movies out there that just aren't that good. I thought this was a cut above that. Sure it's a bit predictable and it's not exactly non-stop action that takes your breath away, but it has an interesting plot and it moves along well. The actors all do a good job and are convincing in their roles. Eva Longoria seems a bit out of her league and her character doesn't develop into that much, but she sure is easy on the eyes. She's okay, but they could have done a bit more with her character. It's not a 5-star movie, but there was never a boring moment for me. Do you want to own it?; perhaps not. Probably better as a one time rental, although it's entertaining enough to watch over again, once in a while."
4,Very good action movie.,"For what it is, this is an intriguing action-packed movie with A+ synergy between Sutherland and Douglas. The soundtrack thumps in perfect pace and keeps it hot right up to the end. Great job!"
2,The Sentinel,"First of all the cast is great and the story line for the first 40 minutes is good. Then it seems the writer/director lost focus and the suspence faded and as if there was no real story anymore and it had to end quickly. I was quite disappointed.If you are really bored and there is nothing on tv, then maybe watch it."
3,What Was The Point?,"A serviceable thriller, but really what was the point? By the numbers, predictable and fairly routine. I expect better from everyone involved. For serious Michael Douglas fans only."
4,Good Solid Entertainment,"Well the critics on both sides of the Atlantic savaged this movie, all I can say is ""Why?"". This is a very good cast with a competent script,well acted and, yes it's Entertaining !! A movie is supposed to entertain isn't it?..well this is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. It may not be Academy Award quality but does that mean it deserves a slating? ..My advice is ...give it a try."
3,Engagement Gift,"I purchased this game for my fiance. It was the only NES game I could find that had a wedding theme. Jykell/Hyde has to get to his wedding without harm. The game play isn't great--boring, not a game that really leaves an impression, but I would recommend it for a wedding/engagement gag gift. He got a kick out of it."
2,not very pleased,"I must admit that I was so excited about this DVD. I had to ship it back to AMAZON because it would not play all of the videos. They shipped me another copy and that one did not play well either. This was so weird beacuse both DVDS had the EXACT problem in the same place. Wow, this was my first time having a problem such as this. I did a little research and was very surprised that AMAZON would even display or sell BOOT-LEGGED (unlegal copies). I was very surprised, but it all makes sense now. I noticed that the DVD that I had ordered, looked different. From now on, I will be very careful about ordering DVDS from AMAZON!!! It also gets a little frustrating having to leave work and make trips to the post office to have these items shipped back."
4,Where did Thomas go?,"This series has provided hours of engaging escape due to Perry's combination of a great mystery accompanied by insights on Victorian England society. I relish Perry's descriptions of dress and interior decoration that place you solidly in the drawing room as a spy of the goings on. This book is a good read, but Thomas was off-stage during most of the action, and I missed his interplay with the upper crust."
3,"Dragged in places, but then redeemed itself","I love this series, so it's hard for me to say anything negative about it. I liked the premise of the murder in a manor house with a bunch of well-to-do people blaming each other. I would have liked to have seen more Charlotte and Thomas interaction. The main problem that I had was that Perry tried to get into the characters' thoughts a bit too much and I couldn't see where she was going with the story. I loved the ending although it seemed rushed. I would have liked to explore the baby selling aspects of the story more."
5,Now thats some good stuff,"wow. this is such a sweet song. the guitar riffs are really soothing, and the bassline is so sweet you can pump it up anywhere! this got some major club play, and being a DJ, i love this song to pump up a crowd."
2,was a nice thought,"I ordered this product before my trip to Cozumel. On the second day there while clearing the mask, the snorkel came out of the holder and sunk. I was unable to find it and had to rent gear the rest of the trip. I've never had that happen before and am not impressed with the clip on this product."
2,OK but cheap construction,This snorkeling kit is OK for newbies or a quick weekend at the beach. Not recommended for serious diving or snorkeling. Materials are cheap.
2,Returned it,"First trip into the water with this set and I knew there was a problem immediately. With the snorkel attached to the strap the left strap would not tighten enough to prevent leakage. Regardless of what I tried to do it just would not stay tight. The nose cup filled with water causing a lot of water up my nose. Cheap for a reason I suppose. Also, the snorkel is not a dry snorkel at all."
5,Very good buy...works well...good quality,"For the price, you can't beat this set. The fins work really well, the mask doesn't leak and the splash guard does a very good job. I bought a set for me, my husband, my mom and my dad, to use snorkeling in the Caribbean. My parents (in their mid 60's) had never snorkeled before, so I had them practice in their above-ground pool, to get used to the equipment. When we actually snorkeled at the reef in St. John, they had the time of their lives, with absolutely NO ISSUES with the mask, fins or snorkel. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!"
4,"Enjoyed the product., You get the quality you pay for.",I snorkeled in Cozumel Mexico for three days with this kit. I was solo and had never snorkeled so I self taught. What a sight I was for the first 30 minutes. I think this is a good starter kit. The mouth piece was good for the first day but stiffened and shaped itself the next two days and irritated my gums. It was pretty easy for a novice to use. I strapped it onto my moped basket with a string and off I went. I even dropped the mouthpiece at about 40 miles an hour and a local chased me down to return it and it was in perfect shape.
2,50% defective!!!!,"I purchased 2 sets (one for me and one for the wife) a couple of weeks before my trip to Hawaii, when I first used it I realized the mask leaks a little, turns out there is a slight rip under the nose. When we got out of the water my wife complaint that the tube leaks on her set which required her to blow water out of the tube every couple of seconds. Don't buy!!!!!!"
3,Rediculous Shipping Charges,"I'll not buy from you again, because of the expensive way you packaged and shipped each item separately when they could have been sent in one box."
3,Poor packaging ruined a good product,"I needed to replace my mask and decided to get this bundled set. Overall, it was a really decent set for the price. The fins were true to size and the snorkel worked well. However, it doesn't get a five from me because of poor packaging. The mask's silicone parts were dented and creased which made it difficult to get a good seal on my face. I had to pull the straps extra tight to prevent water from seeping in, which of course, gave me a horrible red line outline on my face for hours. If the mask arrived unscathed, I would have given this a 5. But given its current state, I will probably replace the mask before my next dive."
5,Great Starter Set,"Got this for my son to introduce him to snorlking. For the price, this set is of very good quality and works very well. After practicing in a pool, we went to the ocean. His mask sealed nicely, keeping the water out and the snorkle design kept him breathing easy. He loved the design of the fins and he was able to keep up with me. Great set for the price."
2,fins were great- the mask was defective,"I ordered two of these US diver fins, masks, and snorkel sets. One set was perfect, the fins, and snorkel was fine with the other set. The mask has a defective mask. The mask had a twisted rubber seal around the face, resulting in a lot of leaking of water while trying to snorkel.Check your mask well before using."
4,A lot of fun...,"It is a very good product and fit every face. It was little hard to adjust it, but I am very satisfied, no water leakage, no annoyance and the fins fitted right on. Very fair and good quality."
1,Major bummer once we finally got it to beach.,"I ordered this for my husband for Christmas when it was a featured ""lightning deal"". We just took it on vacation with us last week & the first time he put the goggles on the pin popped out & now they can't be used. The return window was only until January 31st, so now we are stuck with this broken item."
2,Mask broke on first use,"My mask broke on first use...one of the pieces to hold the strap the mask popped off when adjusting it. Fortunately, my friend, used a small stick to temporarily fix it, and then it lasted the rest of my vacation. The mask gets foggy pretty fast an water gets inside, no matter how I tried to adjust it."
5,snorkel set,hav not used yet... will take on vacation at the end of January and try them out for the 1st time... appear to be great quality and hope they meet my expectations.
3,This product is just ok nothing more,"The maks quality is just ok and it smells like cheap plastic, I guess it is the case of you get as much as you pay for."
3,"fit well, but fog up easily","We decided to purchase our own Snorkel Equipment when we made a trip down to the Great Barrier Reef. We purchased three sets and each member of the family believed they fit very well. Unfortunately there was some fog which was really annoying but we still had a lot of fun. This set is great for those on a budget, just perhaps next time purchase some defogging substance."
5,Excellent!!,"I bought four of these sets for our cruise to the Caribbean. The name of the set is called Cozumel Seabreeze. Oddly enough, we used them in Cozumel! Chankinaab National Park to be exact. The fins, snorkel and mask worked perfectly. We had no trouble adjusting to them or figuring out how to use them. Of course, I did look up some instructions online, which helped, but they are very user friendly and fit well.Trust me, for a basic set, they are more than enough to have a super time snorkeling the Caribbean or whereever. Good luck! Enjoy! :)Steven"
5,Excellent,Just as good as the first if not better! I am a fan and will be reading the third shortly.
3,Unexpected...dont know if its good or bad yet...,"I originally heard ""Party like a Rockstar(So Cal Loco)"" when I was watching ""Dude Where's My Car?"". I didn't know who it was by or anything, but I knew I liked it. Then I was at a used record store and they were giving out free Sprung Monkey stickers. So I downloaded ""What's That You Say?"" and I was hooked. I bought their recent album, ""Get a Taste"" and it's one of my most frequently listened to album. I knew they had two other albums, so based on GAT, I bought ""Mr. Funny Face"". It wasn't what I expected at all. It's so much harder than GAT. I can't decide if I like it or not. I like hard rock more than anyone, but I just can't get past that it's Sprung Monkey playing those hard riffs. I reccomend ""Get a Taste"" to everyone...but as far as ""Mr. Funny Face""...well...the jury's still out on this one..."
3,Rare doesn't always mean awesome.,"I love the band Stone Fox, I really do, and finally had to have more than the other two albums. I opted to pay a steep price for this rare, hard to find, nobody even knows exists, album Dirty Pillows.I was excited about finding this rare gem, but in the end I was generally disappointed, it is not nearly on the level with the albums 'Stone Fox' or 'Totally Burnt', both of which are EXCELLENT and HIGHLY recommended.Don't pay too much for this album, spend your money on their other albums.Just my opinion.Try to check out the INSAINTS and DEVIL DOLL too, great music."
2,Bitten by the Bite Shield,"I actually bought the whole box and dice: the Bite Shield and the Refill cartridges. It seemed like a wonderful idea.First the little fan inside wouldn't work. So I called the manufacturer, who said that I would most likely not be able to hear it if it was working...I took it along on our holiday anyway.In the middle of the night, after being switched on for several hours, it lurched into life as the tiny fan apparently banged against the chassis of the Bite Shield.Noone could sleep with the noise, so we turned it off and turned the mosquitoes on...I've since called the manufacturer, who said they couldn't help, that I should call Amazon. Lovely.I emailed Amazon who were terrific, who are sending me a replacement and a document for returning the defective product.5 points for Amazon, 2 points for the Bite Shield."
5,UNIDEN CORDLESS PHONE DCT7585-3,THE UNIDEN CORDLESS PHONE DCT7585-3 ARRIVED TO ME AS SAID IT WOULD BY THIS SELLER.PHONE WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION.I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER TO ANYONE.
1,Not a good buy for your buck,"We bought this set 2 1/2 years ago. Within the first year (warranty period), the on button stopped working on one phone, so we sent it in to get it fixed. Within the next year, either the on or off buttons stopped working on all 3 phones, rendering them useless. Other than that, they were great phones - easy to use and convenient. The small size didn't bother us, and we never had problems with clarity inside the house, although we couldn't take them outside to use. However, whether these are just bad phones or we happened to get 3 lemons, I can't tell you, but I wouldn't buy them again."
1,"Dangerously innacurate,","Just got this item, showed my son wasn't feverish, temp read 98, but he was burning up, used a neighbors thermometer, reading was 103.1, wow, so uoser at such a lousy product that assures medically approved readings, dangerous."
1,Totally Worthless,Save your money. I spent $50 on this thermometer at right aid after are old one stopped working. It NEVER worked right. I already threw away the packaging so I can't take it back. My son had a very high fever according to my mother thermometer and mine kept saying his temperature was only 97 degrees. He was hot to the touch and hers said he was 102.7. This thermometer can be dangerous. DO NOT BUT THIS!!!!!
2,"Fast, consistent, wrong","I purchased this because I was tired of long waits to get temperatures in the mouth or under the arm. Reading the packaging made this thermometer seem the fastest and most dependable.Although the readings were consistent and fast, they constantly fell short of accurate. My wife, myself, and our daughter all had readings of 93 degrees. My wife and I both read the directions and both tried multiple ways (angles and depths) of taking our temperatures. We cleaned out our ears, and we always got low temperatures."
5,diablo on the tabletop,"The book is great, I remember the release of the box set when ad&d was being phased out for 3.0, I picked this up to supplement my micro lite 20 games."
2,Blank Minds,I found them contradicting themselves. There were no cited sources in book.. They try to imply that the know everything.
5,GREAT FOR GUYS WITH BEARDS...,"Its small size and inline trimmer lets you maneuver around in small spaces. You can lay it flat against your beard and trim all the errant ""stick up"" hairs. I searched em high and low and tried all kinds of em but most of them have too big of a head or a weird pop-up trimmer or something else that gets in the way. But this one, this one works real good. Lets you trim your neck of a five day stubble in two passes; one pass using the leading trimmer edge and then finish up with the foil side. Great Value. Good buy."
5,A Difficult Translation but a Riveting Story,"Holander's is the standard translation of the Poetic (or Elder) Edda. It is stirring and poetic but somtimes difficultly archaic (unless you already know that ""hight"" means called or named). Any difficulties, though, are swept away by the power and grandeur of the Norse originals. Though imperfectly preserved, they remain he poinant testament to a proud and strong civilization."
5,One of the finest Conversion stories ever written.,"As a convert from the ""imploding"" Anglican church (Episcopalian), I found this conversion story by Dr. Scott Hahn one of the finest I've ever read. All of my earlier anti-Catholic bias paralleled Dr. Hahn's. His search for the One, True Church founded by Jesus Christ is a fascinating journey. Dr. Hahn, a former Protestant minister, has become one of the greatest Catholic apologists of the 20th Century. For those sitting on the fence as to ""Coming Home,"" read this book. The truth he found in the Roman Catholic Church is the same Truth that has existed for Two Thousand years."
1,No Epiphany,"I found this book to be a wonderful telling of the trials and tribulations of Mr. Hahn's and his wife's journey to the Catholic faith. What I did not find is why he gave up the faith he was raised in and became a minister in to become Catholic.He gives a number of examples in the book where he argued Catholic vs Protestant with an expert voicing the Protestant stance. In each and every case, Catholic either won the day or, at least, the contest ended in stalemate, but he never once shares the winning arguement.The main positive I take from his story, is that Catholicism is not the bugaboo that most Protestant churches denounce it as being.However, his all too quick, it seems, embracing of Catholicism shows not so much the truth (and it may well be) of the Catholic church, but rather it showed me a man who was not as strong in his faith as he believed."
5,Perfect for fallen away Catholics,"There's so much I could say about Rome Sweet Home. My husband and I have decided to buy ten copies for family members who have left the Church like we did. We will probably end up giving many more away. This is perfect for fallen away Catholics, especially if you ended up in a charismatic fellowship (Assembly of God), which is where we were for several years."
4,"Beware Bogus ""Reviews""","Substantively, this is an excellent conversion tale well-told, which explains why some people are willing to go to such great lengths to discredit it. My only beef with it is the Hahns' unqualified endorsement of the teachings of Dr. Mark Miravalle. Miravalle's Marian theology shows both ""maximalist"" tendencies and a determination to sidestep the cautionary language of the Second Vatican Council"
4,Answers Questions,"This book answered many questions I had about cathology, while making a very strong argument. An enjoyable read as well."
5,Inspirational,"By reading this book you can clearly see the Lord working in the lives of the Hahn family. The book is easy to read (I read it in a day) and gives good views of what the Catholic faith is all about. However, this book does not go into much detail. It merely explains what the beliefs are and some Bible references to back it up. It is definitely not a book that will explain all the answers, yet it certainly does make you think and want to read and discover more. I have had the great opportunity to meet Mr. Hahn and I must say that that I was even more impressed with him than I expected to be. The book clearly shows his personality and the love that he and his wife have for the Lord. A definite read for all Catholics and non-Catholics."
1,Cool Review,This is a ok book but I don't think that it is very realistic and it is kind of stupid. Thank You
4,The book of many journeys,"I bought this book because in illuminati myth, the wizard of oz series is a mind control slaves worst nightmare. The books are all exactly like they were when first published, except the pictures are not included. The art in the 15 book series is very important from am ind control stand point. Overall, the book is wonderful."
1,Not for kids,This is not an edition for kids. The writing is small and there are no pictures. Each page has 2 columns of writing.The price was very good though compared to others advertised.Strictly for adults
2,Watch out for 600+ pages of small print!,"I like the idea of having all 15 books in one combined book. It seemed like it would make for some fun bed time story reading. However, the small print stopped me in my tracks. I don't feel the book is necessarily of poor quality, however, it is a paper back book, something that seems odd for such a weighty novel. My advice, consider whether or not you feel capable of reading 600+ pages (with no illustrations) of 2-column small font print before making this purchase."
5,Hardback makes a nice gift,"So, what do you get? (This is a description of the hardcover edition)It's a nice solid book, well bound, quite thick (700 plus pages) that makes a good gift. The cover is colorful, and it looks like it'll last for years, even with a bit of mishandling from kids.You get all of the L. Frank Baum ""Oz"" stories, except for a few really obscure short stories that were published in the newspapers, where the Wogglebug from ""Oz"" visits the USA.The text is printed in two columns, but it's not hard to read - from looking at 'search-inside-the-book', it looks like the hardback is a bit easier to read than the paperback. There aren't any illustrations though.For a kid who liked the first Oz book and wants to read the others, it's a lot cheaper than buying them all separately!On balance, recommended, but it looks like it's worth getting the hardcover rather than the paperback."
4,"Okay packaging, but looks used","Everything was really good, except that the packaging is a little torn up. They should have mentioned that in the description, other than that everything thing else looks good."
3,"Toto Today, Not Yesterday 's Toto Monkees(JohnnyG.)","If your looking for toto past. Well you won't find it on this CD. But a good mix of music. As i can see toto still can rock. But if you are looking for the old ToTo. This is not the one. If you like change, then this cd will be good for you. If any one who is just getting in to ToTo, Then buy their old CDs."
3,In between Kansas and Oz,Unabashedly upbeat power pop circumvents some of the cheese factor with crafty bells and whistles hearkening back to the progressive influences.
5,What a supprise,"I'm a big TOTO fan.I have all their albums.This one is fantastic.This best in a long time.All song are great, exept one.The song ""let it go"" is worth the whole album.It's also great the band wrote coments on every song.Just buy it."
1,no button for zero stars?,"I love all of the old great Herb Alpert songs. I bought this CD thinking I would get an updated version of the same. I was wrong. This CD is total crap. I guess you would like it if you listen to ""lite jazz"", ""smooth jazz"", or any radio station that calls its' programming ""the quiet storm"". I hate all of that pseudo jazz music, I would rather listen to muzak in an elevator than this stuff. What's disappointing is knowing what kind of music Herb is capable of producing and playing, and getting this instead. What a letdown. I played this CD exactly one time and that's the last time I'm ever gonna play it."
5,Trick Daddy/ Trina music videos on DVD,"YES, 2 music videos in 1--1st up TRCK DADDY, track listings: boy, bout a lotta thangs, change my life, gone with your bad self, let's go, nann, play no games, round here, sweatin' me, they don't live long, & trick daddy.2nd up TRINA, track listings:faith, family & music, nann, that's cool, what'd you come here for, & where is the love.I rated this dvd a 5 (EXCELLENT) (see track listings above)"
3,Nice read if your also a single gay man wanting to adopt.,"If your are not, then the book lacks interest. This is his story of adoption. Didn't find any information I wouldn't have found on the net, but good to read the order he did things in."
5,This book is a readable summary of a technical issue.,The authors of this book have taken what is surely a very complex issue and made it both readable and informative. They cover all or most of the issues concerning both tap and bottled water and allow the reader to make up his or her mind about which course to follow. I particularly appreciated the history of drinking water going back to Biblical and Talmudic times. I think anyone who drinks water would benefit from this book.
3,A good read....,"I'll admit the first story about ""Juicy Brown"" was so hard to finish, because of it I almost didn't even want to read the other two stories in the book.It lost all the taste to me she was just plain old ghetto,wasn't very interesting and at times just down right sheisty...I took away two stars just because of that story...-But on the other hand the second two stories were definately page turners...Especially ""Who's got Game"" about Lyric by La Jill Hunt she's starting to become one of my favorites.I couldn't put the book down when it came to that story.I think around the way girls 1 was better,but 2 could have easily passed 1 if it wasn't for that juicy brown story,because juicy and her kids was just a hot mess...."
1,Not Accurate,"This thermometer is not accurate. In consecutive readings it can vary by as much as a degree and a half. It is also not clear if you have to add a degree to the reading to get the oral equivalent (Vicks says on the thermometer that armpit readings are generally 1 degree lower than oral and 2 degrees lower than anal readings, but when we tested our son's armpit reading with this termomether against an anal reading they were the same. So go figure.)All in all I would not rely on this product. We're going to toss it and buy an ear thermometer."
2,what the?,"I really didn't care for this book overall. I will say that ""...Shawshank Redemption"" is a very tight and well-written story, but it's really the only one which kept my attention. The first half of ""Apt Pupil"" is both engaging and disturbing (in a good way), but it soon drifts into an out-of-control rambling mess and loses its novelty. The final two didn't make much of an impression, and overall, the 4 stories really don't work very well under the same cover. Check it out from the library, read the first story, and turn it back in."
3,Stephen King,"Stephen King is a great writer my class we read his book but we only cover two part of his and they were SHAWSHANK, THE BODY both of the part where great storys to read. I would go around and tell people to go out and the get the book and read it. i wish we had finish the whole book but we did not. but to sum up everything go and get the book and support stephen king."
5,Wife loved it,"I don't read long fiction so I personally don't know anything about the work however, the wife is a fan of Mr. King and says the book is great. She says she would recommend this work to anyone to read and enjoy."
4,Seasons,"""Redemption"" is the best and ""Pupil"" is dark, and good too. The Body is OK. I liked the characters and club who told the last story, ""Breathing Method"" but the story itself was just an average short story."
1,"Garbage, Do not buy.","Basically all of our family can use this thermometer and get 3 different temperatures that range in over 5 degrees. The first reading is the most accurate, then it will start reading 92 degrees for people clearly with a fever.It could be making random temperatures for all I know. I was buying this to replace another digital that always read too low. This one is worse."
1,Stopped working after 2 months,"I thought this would be great with the colored readout, but it seemed like the battery was low from the first use. I only used it 3 times within the first week and when I went to use it a couple months later, the battery was dead. I took it back to the store and the manager let me get the same one to replace it. I was happy since this one seemed to have a stronger battery. I only used it about 4 times the day I purchased it. When I went to use it about 4 months later, it was dead. I assume the battery drains even when not in use. Other BD digital thermometers I have had in the past have lasted years, not weeks or months."
2,"accurate, but hard to use:","If you're an adult, have a large mouth, and are patient, this is the thermometer for you. However, this instrument is difficult to hold in your mouth because of the wedge design of the probe and it takes the full minute to register. I'm purchasing an ear thermometer."
1,Don't bother,"I bought the Alpinestars Reflex Knee Guards for riding motorcycle, and have been using them for several months now. They suck. Are too way too bulky in order to use them inside any pants, jeans or trousers. Extremely uncomfortable. The velcro straps get stuck between themselves causing a mess and everything come unravel. Besides, it slides around all the time, just by walking. I don't want to imagine what would happen in a fall. Already buying a different brand."
1,Hard Disk Problems,"I love the AV480 when it works.However, I've gone through 3 units already. Each one has had its hard disk break within 1 week of use. Unfortunately that was enough time for me to record about 60GB of ripped DVDs (now all lost).Has anyone had this device work for more than a week?I was extremely careful with it and it still broke. On the other hand, I've purchased one of those Microsoft Portable Media Centers. That has withstood much harsher handling. Unfortunately it is only 20GB. I like the AV480 more, but I wish it would work for more than a week."
1,The hard disk problem,"After few months of use the hard disc crashed.I had this unit for 2 months and listened in the average of 10 hours a week, which is nothing compare to the Discman 50 hours a week. And the worst thing that I downloaded 2,000 songs out of 500 I got from I tunes and they all will be erased, because Archos don't guarantee the song recovery. They told me that I should have backed them up. I would if I knew that the unit would go badly just after 2 months.I did not even use for video, pathetic."
4,Great Product - Battery life concerns,"I've had mine 3 months (since March 2005) and it's worked great. I've had no hard drive problems. The software has worked great. BUT, my battery life is now suspect. It appears that the 18 hours of battery life has shortened to about 2 1/2 minutes. I'm now attempting to completely recharge and also to update the firmware, but I'm afraid that I may have to send it off to have the battery replaced. Other than that, I love this thing. Beyond the multiple gigabytes of music, I have a fine collection of movies and cartoons for my kids on road trips. Very handy."
1,Some units MAY work,"Obviously there is something wrong with quality control on this product. The unit I received never worked. For the price, I'm not willing to risk a short term performance and got a refund instead of a replacement. Good luck at getting a functioning unit if you order the av480. I'm waiting for a reliable product."
1,Garbage!,I ordered 2 of these and they both came broken so I had to return them! Way too fragile! Super cute but they're complete garbage! Don't waste your time ordering as I'm sure they'll come to you broken!
2,Schizophrenic Album,"The two disks in this set are quite distinct. The first is vintage Jim Kweskin jug band music, but it is only 33 minutes long. Stingy. The second consists of 10 mostly well-known mostly sentimental songs sung soggily.My rating is based on four stars for the first disk and zero stars for the second. I find it hard to relate the two glowing views posted above to the album that I heard."
5,Hidden Falls,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It is a very good explaination of the landscape and culture of Norway and its people. I like to read books that lead up to the different people in the story that are involved, and really keeps you wondering ""Who done it"".I just loved the book and I am sure you will also. I would also love to read more books by Carla."
4,Another cute stuffed animal for baby...,"I originally bought this as a baby gift. It's very soft, cute features, and seems to be sewn together well. If you're familiar with other TY Beanie Babies, this one is no different. I purchased this particular one on clearance...for its size, I wouldn't pay more than $3 for it."
1,Blame It On Bad Remastering,"At long last these two great albums see the light of day on CD -- only to be botched by Sony/BMG/Collectibles. I have to disagree with the previous reviewer who raved about the ""pristine remastered sound."" It is harsh, compressed, nearly unlistenable! This is truly one of the worst-sounding CDs I have ever heard. Absolutely brutal! The first album, And Then He Kissed Me, is by far the worst; Blame It On Love fairing a little better. To top it off, the inserts are skimpy and don't reproduce any of the original artwork. No (re)mastering credits, or blame, are given. This whole production is a real shame and a disappointment. Here's hoping a reissue label out there (that actually cares about the music) gives these albums the proper treatment."
5,Rachel Revisited-- BETTER THAN EVER!,"If you are a fan of Rachel Sweet, you will be thrilled to hear Rachel's final two original LPs at long last digitally remastered on CD! The sound is crisp, clear, and truly exceptional!Each time I hear this amazing talent, I am both shocked and confused as to why she never really made it ""big,"" and also as to why no other current rockers have evered covered any of her highly poetic, original songs?If you are new to Rachel's music, this is perhaps the BEST CD to buy, as it highlights a wide range of this wonderfully versatile performer's endlessly creative talent.Five Stars from beginning to end!"
4,Buy this!,"I paid two dollars and it worked better than the one originally came to purchase. This is now my ""#!"" and the other is its backup!"
2,lousy earbuds,"the sound is fine, but my earholes aren't perfect dime-sized circles, therefore these earbuds don't really fit. they hurt and they fall out.the price came to only 8 or 10 bucks including the shipping, so i guess it was worth a try, but i've got to find something better. any suggestions?"
2,.58 cents shipping,"I found this item on sale, what a great deal. Name brand, perfect condition, a little difficult to keep in the ears. I was charged over $5 for shipping and handling. When the package arrived it had only cost .58 cents to ship! An item is not on sale when they over charge somewhere else. They are still getting the money. I felt ripped off, won't buy from them again."
3,Samsung Mistake,Samsung cornered the market by making certain phones not compatible with Regular Head Phones. The design could have been better. The physical product is pretty shabby but the sound is greatYes you have to buy them but treat it with TLC contrary to what others wrote it will fit into the average person ear perhaps not for a heavy jog but definitely for a walkPerhaps Samsung should switch back to regular head phones so that a consumer is free to buy anyOne cute feature is the ability to talk to someone and having them heard through both ears
4,They work just fine,"I bought these despite the negative reviews:Facts:1.They're cheap2.They're an alternative for those of us who don't want to use bluetooth headsets.3.They can be used to listen to music from the phone in stereo.4.The sound quality is fine. People can hear me better when I use these as opposed to talking into the phone itself.I got everything I wanted; a hands free alternative so I can drive that works and is cheap.Yes, the cords are long but they can be tied if you can take 5 mins to do so. And yes, the ear buds are a bit big but they still work for me."
1,Not for Blackjack II,Just know this product does not fit the blackjack II. I ended up sending it back. The price was so good but i ended up paying in the end because of the shipping cost and then the cost to return it.
3,Canticle for Liebowitz meets Lord of the Rings,"Story outline is well-hashed here. It's an OK book, but not nearly the quality I'd grown accustomed to after reading this book having just finished ""On the Beach"", ""Alas, Babylon"", ""Lucifer's Hammer"", ""The Road"" and a couple others. The writing was fine, but characters just...die...and I never got much emotion out of it. They were here, then not."
4,An Entertaining Read...,"McDevitt's story is meant to entertain you. This book, like his others, is a fun and light read (as I recall, it doesn't have a stamp on the front cover that says ""Compare to Homer's works!""); for those expecting a fun adventure from the comfort of your couch, it'll be worth the time."
3,"Good plot, decent writing","The book kept my attention with an interesting plot that kept moving forward. I didn't like the writing at some points, but with the plot going onward, I was able to keep on going with the story."
1,This book sucked!,We had to read this book for Engish class and I hated reading every last word. I enjoyed reading Julius Ceaser or Homer or William Shakespere better than this book. I was totally lost around the part from page 1 to page 400 something. I couldn't even stay awake for 5 minutes while reading this book. It had a good summary on the back off the book. That's why i bought the stupid thing!
2,Disappointing relative to his prior works,"I had expected more after reading The Hercules Text and Engines of God. It seemed like a standard post-apocalypse story, with very few surprises, not particularly interesting characters, a romance which is tepid at best, and an ending which is so dull as to be unexpected in a science-fiction story. I can only hope the next book is up to his usually high standards."
4,What will the future look like?,"I liked this book, although I had several problems with it. The book proposes that all books had not survived the 1000 years time after a plague wiped out almost all of humanity. Yet the dead sea scrolls and egyptian papyrus have survived far longer into our time. The characters show some modern attitudes and handle situations that a ""primate"" post-apocalyptic society would, I believe, react to differently. The ending is a bit of a let down, and the mysterious Ksrik Endine's reaction, destroying all those books!!! was insane, and the boatmen just watching him destroy them is nonsense. Other than that, the book does present an interesting future and interesting characters."
3,Works great,"I have no problems with it yet. Computer even runs faster and I have twice the memory I had before, so I'll recommend this product."
1,Beeping too loud too many,"It was difficult taking temperature while waking my husband up every morning with this unnecessarily loud beeps that goes on for too long. It was taking toll on our lives with this Vicks Ovitrack. Once the battery is gone, replacing would not help. It just give you error message. There is no back light, no memory for previous temp. I switch to Terumo C-531 from Japan. It costs $18 to $24, but it has back light to show when it is ready to take the temp, reads after 20 seconds with quiet 3 beeps with memory. It is smaller and water proof, so you can wash it each time. I wish I had this all along."
2,Roy's Simplicity has the worst packaging EVER!,"When I first got this disc in the mail, I thought of was a bootleg. The ""book"" was what appears to be a sloppy hand-cut picture that doesn't fit inside the CD case, the picture is grainy and probably done on a horrible 200 dpi color bubble jet printer, and it looms completely unprofessional. I was shocked that the disc itself was actually pressed. Thankfully, there is more care in the music than the artwork! It's the worst ""professional"" packaging of an album I've ever seen."
5,Great Espresso Cup Set for the Money,"I am very satisfied with this purchase. They have a high quality look and feel, and the cups and saucers all stack quite nicely. Great price, too."
4,Nice cups but short,The coffee tastes different in these low profile cups. They're ok but I like taller ones.
5,American McGee is a genius,"Hands down, the best video game I've ever played. It's become something of a cult classic, and rightfully so; it's delightfully creepy, complex (to the reviewers who claimed it was ""linear"" - are you insane?), and the graphics are awesome. I've beat it several times now, and I just keep going back for more."
5,"If you know what you're doing, you'll love it","I've heard a lot of people say that this really isn't needed. Most of these people intend to use it for their PSP. This is not the only use for this card. If you have a Sony camera that supports high speed shooting, this card is a must. With that said, if you own a PSP, and you know what you're doing, this card is a must as well. Reason is, the slower Memory Stick Pro Duo, has a write speed at 15Mbps. The high speed card clocks in at about 80 Mbps. Yeah. Grab your USB 2.0 / Firewire Card reader for this one, it makes a HUGE difference.The average user, however, will not care. They're probably using the 5 pin USB cable to transfer files, which comes in at about 10 Mbps. There is NO point in buying this card if this is the case for you. On the other hand, if you're like me, and crave the capacity of 1 gb for your psp, odds are you'll be using all 1000 mb of it. You have to go high speed."
3,Please Consider the 2006 Edition of This Book,"I freely admit that this book has seen better days. Please note that I have written an entirely new edition (2006) of this book, which is full of practical tools. The 1998 edition is out of print and should not be offered on Amazon anymore. Please give the 2006 edition a try. It has all ""high level"" material of the original but is MUCH more practical. Alexandra R. Lajoux"
1,Lacking in practical advise for IT managers,"In reading the title and on-line reviews of this book, I thought it would be a great resource for me as I have been charged with establishing an IT strategic direction for a post-merger, $1.8 Billion venture. Although I am sure that the writer is knowledgeable on the broader issues facing mergers, I found no practical advise in the 5 pages dedicated to Information Systems. I found the prime considerations facing an IT manager who is faced with replacing systems to be trivial and off the mark.I plan to return this book."
2,Many good questions - few useful answers,"This book provides a decent list of questions about integrations, but the answers were very high level and offered few insights into the real nitty-gritty of getting it done.Perhaps it could be a reasonable introduction to the topic, but it is not a practical or useful execution guide."
1,Not the Japanese Version! Horrible!,"For any true Sailor Moon fans, you know that the Japanese subtitled versions are the way to go. This DVD is advertised as Japanese/English with English subtitles. The DVD menu even has the options to choose Japanese language and English subtitles, but neither are truly available.The voice actors are terrible compared to the original Japanese ones, there are many cut scenes or delete episodes, so it is not truly the ""Special Uncut Version.""However, if you have watched the dubbed English versions from the beginning and can stand the horrible voice acting, I'm sure you'll find this just lovely.I know nothing of the plot yet, so I can't comment on that, but I have already purchased the original Japanese version to watch."
5,PLEASE SOMEBODY ANSWER MY QUESTION!!!,"THE AUDIO IS IN JAPANESE OR ONLY IN ENGLISH??? AND THE SUBTITLES OF THIS BOXSET ARE IN ENGLISH TOO??' PLEASE SOMEONE HAS BOUGHT THIS BOXSET TELL ME ABOUT IT, THANK YOU !!!!"
1,The Homing,"I'm reading these reviews and I'm trying to figure out anyone could have actually enjoyed this book. This is without a doubt the worst book I have ever read. I had read Saul's book Black Lightning and found that one rather interesting so I decided to give The Homing a shot. I figured it was a bestselling novel so it has to be pretty decent. Wrong. The only reason I kept reading was because I just kept telling myself that it had to get better. Unfortunately, it just kept getting worse. The ending of this book was beyond ridiculous. I guess this book is considered to be in the horror genre. The only horror to be found in this book is that John Saul could conceive of something so absurd and that anyone could actually find this an enjoyable read. I'm writing this review to warn everyone out there that it's not worth your time to read this book. Trust me."
4,Freaky!,"While a bit far fetched I enjoyed listening to this tale from John Saul. The story drew me in from the very beginning and I was anxious to see what happens twoards the end. I have to confess I did like the ending. Some parts of this book were really creepy and this kept me glued to my stereo. It was a tad disturbing to see that the majority of victims were teen agers but it gave the book that extyra thrill and horrific jolt. All the characters were engaging and played their parts nicely. I also liked all the underlining sexual themes in the book; anybody else catch those? The reader did a good job, though at times her mid western accents got a bit too much. She did portray the drama of the book well occasionally going over the top in some of the more vilent scenes. This version contains two audio cassettes and is narrated by a single reader."
3,"Engrossing, but ultimately disappointing","This book is extremely captivating. You'll be hooked from the first chapter, trying to find out exactly what's happening to the main characters, and why they are acting so oddly. However, I only gave it three stars because of the ending-- it seemed like way too much of a cop-out, not to mention it really depressed me for the rest of the day. Also, the plot was original and interesting but nevertheless very implausible. Sometimes this doesn't matter, but in this book it really took away from the enjoyability factor. I'd probably recommend it anyway, though, just for a quick read that will at least hold your attention."
3,The Homing,I loved the begining of the book. The plot was awesome. It wasn't as good as Second Child which was one of the greatest books I have ever read. The ending was really horrible and I was extremly dissapointed. I don't think anyone liked the ending.
2,"The Shield, 5th Season","This is very, very sad (quality, content). The majority of the CD component is reruns from previous seasons. All they added was a very brief 1 minute segment where Danny is in the hospital with the baby and talks to Vic. Next the only other thing that is new is a minuscule segment of a poorly attended funeral for Lem with Vic opening the casket lid to put in the arm wrestling award. I wouldn't call this a ""season"" at all, just a review. A very poor ending for all of the drama in the previous series. Would not recommend buying.There is a very lengthy tribute for the deceased executive producer which shows that he was well liked and respected."
5,"Gorgeous Paintings, Important Story","Gorgeous paintings and an important story are why I have rated this book so highly. It's rare to come across a children's book with such wonderful art that also has an important message to communicate -- that children are an essential voice to the community, and that communities working together can solve problems and make life better for everyone. The paintings also add nuances to the story that children love to pick up on -- the paintings in this book are especially well-integrated into the story, and vice versa. I look forward to seeing more work from this new author, as he is one of the most original story-tellers and artists I have come across. As for the sweet roll, it's so delicious looking I can almost taste it!"
2,"Oster Home Pet Grooming Kit, 16-Piece Deluxe",I had purchased this same exact model of clippers almost 5 years ago and they worked perfect so I bought them again expecting the same quality. The first one that I received had less power then the one I purchased years ago which is a major factor especially when trying to use them to trim dogs hair. I returned them for a new pair thinking that the first one was just defective but when I received the replacement it had the same amount of weak power as the first. I'm really upset with Oster for changing the power of this product over the years.
5,A Must Read for Fantasy Lovers,"Straight and to the point. This is an excellent book, as is its sequel ""War of Mists"" and Im just dying for the next one!!"
2,Why no support,"This looks like it would be a great product BUT it is incompatible with HP products which you have to dig to find out on the joke of a support system they have installed since HP/Compaq is one of the largest computer companies in the country seem like they could have add this tidbit of info somewhere on the packaging or at least on the web site in plain view, so now I have an expensive door stop in my office."
4,Zboard gaming,"This is a very worth while product. Very slick key sets. The paint is startinting to wear on some of the well used keys but the unit itself works flawlessly. I also bought a Razor Copper Head mouse that did not play well with this keyboard. I suspect a driver issue, but removed the mouse and everything works normally now. The mouse went to another machine. Go to the web site and download the latest drivers and you'll be just fine. Good investment, if you play shooters you'll love this keyboard."
1,Disappointed,"The keyboard worked well for a couple of months, then it QUIT!!I was VERY disappointed."
1,Attention Windows 98 Users,This keyboard is not compatable with Windows 98.This information is missing from the product discription.
4,imagine that u play your favorite game without this keyboard,helloas i said this keyboard made my play a lot easier with the shortcute that it have on it and i can change the keys as i like from game to game but i hope they expande the coverage of the games that they have there keys it worth to try it
2,zboard is simply awesomage.,"I like it, the keys are very pleasant and very comfortable compared to my 3 year old keyboard that came with my old vpr matrix computer. I recommend it, i dont think i will be using the 2nd keyset ....but who knows that might change in the future but for now. I am very pleased i bought this. This is a true gamers keyboard PLUS everyone who likes to type, its pleasant to do as well."
2,"Great concept, but Quirky","I LOVED the IDEA of this keyboard, and being able to switch keysets, cause in addition to gaming on my computer, I also do video editing in PREMIERE and AFTER EFFECTS, and also work in Photoshop. I loved the Photoshop keyset and the gaming keysets- HOWEVER- the actual hardware had ISSSUUUUEEES!!!! Like for example I'd be working away and all of the sudden a key I HADNT PUSHED would be going ENDLESSLY and in order to make it stop I had to remove the whole Keyset!! This started happening more and more frequently and cost me alot of time and effort when I had projects ruined or crashed by this keyboard. I contacted the manufacturer, got no response- downloaded the latest drivers and all that junk- but it never got any better- in fact it got worse! Finally I removed the whole thing and went back to my old keyboard- not nearly as fun, but it WORKS RIGHT!"
1,Worked for less than a day!,"I bought this as a birthday present for my husband. It caused him more of a headache than anything. After taking the time to get it installed (had problems with installation) he finally got it going, and it seemed great. Then after about 4 or 5 hours of use it completely quit working."
1,Good idea - bad product,"After eleven months, the ""N"" key stopped working. Reinstalling the software never solved the problem. Tech Support is limited to EMAIL ONLY, which was super poor quality and totally useless. Even though the keyboard is under warranty, I could never get Tech Support to agree to a RMA. At this point I've switched to a wireless keyboard and mouse. I wish I had done this earlier because I would have saved money and not lost hours corresponding to a company that just wants your money. :-("
1,Controlling the Game - Phil Laak,"I returned this product. My first clue that I was in for a disappointment was when I attempted to open the case and the printed cover came off with the removal of the seal. The video itself had the sound quality of a poorly made home video. During card playing sequences, to hear Phil, I had to turn the volume to max, then I could barely hear Phil over the din in the background, making me thankful that the video was extremely short...surely Mr. Laak, with all of his money and talent, could have produced a better product."
5,Round Round - Sugababes,"UK CD Maxi Single Track Listing for -""ROUND ROUND"" - SUGABABES1) Album Version2) Craigie & Crichton Remix3) Soulwax Remix4) Seani B Remix (featuring Zaguzaar)2002includes 4 exclusive postcards."
5,The best rock & roll cd the 70's,I bought Black Stone Cherry and was totaly blown away. This is definitively the best rock & roll CD since Led Zeppelin. Come quick to France guies and put the fire on.
4,Black Stone Cherry,"Drums & guitars are poundin' in this one! While none of the songs have the power of voice and lyrics that 'Lonely Train' has, there are a number of cuts that I keep coming back to. Rain Wizard... the rock is good...mostly I like the name... 'Hell and High Water' is a great modern-day love song...powerful without being mushy. I keep hearing the ghost of Southern Rock echoing through 'Tired of the Rain' and that's fine by me. I can't wait to hear more from this band and see where they take it all."
3,bait of satan student book,I ordered the student book not knowing it is more like an answer booklet.I had to than order the actual book to read than use the student book to write the answers to the study questions in.I have not finished it yet.
1,Something to Think About,"The other reviews I see here are extremely varied in the way folks interpreted this book. There are lots of answers that I don't know to the questions the other reviews raised, but one thing I would encourage everyone to do is look up and read Matthew 6:15. As Jesus Himself taught us how to pray, He also explained forgiveness (SEE at the end): ""After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. FOR IF YE FORGIVE MEN THEIR TRESPASSES, YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER WILL ALSO FORGIVE YOU: BUT IF YE FORGIVE NOT MEN THEIR TRESPASSES, NEITHER WILL YOUR FATHER FORGIVE YOUR TRESPASSES.""(Matt. 6:9-15, KJV) Just something to remember . . ."
5,Best Modern Tarot Interpretation for your daily 'Carte du Jour'.,"I think these tarot cards are perhaps the best recent ones around.A basic book is included.And I absolutly enjoyed the classical ones of medieval Europe and the more modern ones by Oswald Wirth and Arthur Waite.Yet, Farber and Zerner's current beautiful design is the best for thesedays.They're artistically done as a collage for each card.The cartomancy graduands at the beginner's level , may still want to procure a set of these Tarot cards anyhow.All the nidifugous fledglings of Tarot will continue to enjoy the artist plummage of this unique modernist style.Including myself !"
5,I love this knife!,"I have had this same knife for about 3-4 years now & abused it through culinary school & working at a high end kitchen & it still cuts like new.I bought another one for my Dad because he hasn't had a decent knife in years & I knew he needed something very low maintenance. This knife is perfect & he can even put it in the dishwasher (which is highly discouraged by me).This is a really versatile knife as well & can be used for it's traditional use of slicing bread, but if you want perfect tomato slices-this is your knife! Cutting almost every kind of fruit or veggies is ideal with this knife.I would absolutely recommend this knife to anyone, professional or not!"
3,Weird science describes super weapons,This book is presented as a set of presentation slides that describe a tremendous weapons capability developed by the Russians based on a solution to the grand unification of forces. Supposedly the weapons use the theories to create gravitational beams which penetrate armor and then convert into electromagnetic beams frying the insides of tanks and missiles. A lot of doubtful assumptions go into making the theory work and the supporting evidence is questionable. I have to rate the book as neutral. It is definately bad science but I'm not sure yet that its goal was to be good science
1,Save your Money...,"The information contained in this book is all available in the tutorials which come with the program. What's more, it is laid out in such a confusing way that it is next to useless. I'm going to check out Macromedia's *Dreamweaver from the Source* -- I was very impressed with their Freehand guide. As for this book, all I can say is ""read the title ... and save your money."""
5,Find a way,thank you for this wonderful gift. This will make a great and wonderful gift family/ friend enjoyed and will enjoy lowering cholesterol
2,A entertaining episode,"Ok. This episode was purely a chance to highlight Diana Muldar's character Dr. Pulaski. Its standard scifi, certainly not an outstanding episode but fairly entertaining. If your looking for standard scifi, then this episode is for you."
3,Eric's Burden,"Eric Burdon is justly regarded as one of the finest R&B singers to emerge in the 60's, never mind the pointless distinction between white/black. It's also fair to say that, since his departure from War, his recordings have been erratic. This reissue of the 1982 soundtrack for ""Comeback,' in which he also starred, avoids the excesses of which Burdon is sometimes guilty. The first two songs, which would have made a great 45 (remember them?) are alone worth the price of the album. I've seen Eric a number of times through the years, starting with his front man duties with the Animals, and in fact attended one of my favorite shows when he premiered the songs on this album. Burdon always delivers live and in person, and this album is a reminder that he can do it in the studio too."
4,It worths your money.,"I bought this book at a half-price book store. Usually I don't like any books in the ""How-To"" series, because they are written in a fix format, I mean for every issue or problem -- no metter you like or not. It just seems to add some letters to assemble a book! I feel it likt that there is little bit meat in a big wok of water soup! But this book is good, after I read a couple of chapters. It worths what it costs me -- half price!"
5,"Good Context for, Presentation of an Exemplary Speech","Great presentation of MLK's incredible speech. Newsreel footage of ""The Big March"" provides context and takes you back in time.A young Peter Jennings narrates the beginning of the first selection on the DVD."
3,Krussell phone cover Cingular 3125,"This cover works OK. Manufacturer packaging says use for Qtek 8500 & Dopod 710, not Cingular 3125. I think all of those phones are supposed to be the same, but on my Cingular 3125 the slot for the sync cable/charger is partially obstructed by the case. Also, there is a plastic cover over the exterior display as well as the keys. The inside main display is not covered. The case does make the phone ""thicker"" but it still fits comfortably in my pocket. This cover is a workable option since no Cingular specific designed cover has been made yet."
1,still havent even RECIEVED IT!!!,terriblei havent even recieved my book i should've goten like 3 weeks ago!!!
3,Good enough for me,"Quite a heavy stand. The patterns are not as 'delicate' and 'fine' as I would have wanted them to be, but the stand is good enough for me."
3,Harmless cuteness,"This movie is just cute enough to pass the Chick-lit test. I do wish however that there was a stronger male lead. James Marsden wasn't hitting any of my romantic buttons. Heigl continues to show that she is the new Julia Roberts of romantic comedies and often times come off like the girlfriend everyone knows. Malin Akerman's acting was distractingly bad, but I did love the ending with all the 27 dresses."
4,27 dresses,It took a little longer than others to arrive at my house. But DVD is in good condition and has nothing wrong with it.
4,Great condition,This product arrived very fast! In great condition and ready to be wrapped as a Xmas gift!
3,Love Kathryn Heigl,"So..after a long evening in West Hollywood sharing drinks with this beautiful unkown star, I have been a fan from the beginning. The camera loves this woman. But, most importantly, this is a sweet, popcorn movie....put on your pajamas, make yourself some popcorn an enjoy this lovely story of a lonely friend who does everything to help her friends make memories....until she realizes she deserves to be loved as well..... and that is the secret of the movie.... Don't be afraid to love and to be loved in return...And, damn she looks fine. Congratulations Katherine!!!! You've come a long way from Utah and from those early days in West Hollywood."
3,"Not great, but not bad.","I don't normally watch this kind of thing, so I'm not even sure how to review this. It was totally predictable, of course, but it wasn't horrible.Katherine Heigl is the best thing in it--a bit of a modern Thelma Todd. She _does_ seem like a doormat, though, whatever reviewer Mr. Keogh thought, but she's cute and she's more interesting than were the heroines of the handful of other chick flicks I've actually seen (all, like, three of them). The rest of the characters are pretty flat, though.I did sort of like that all four of them get their own bit of comeuppance at the end: Jane for being a pushover; Tess for being selfish; Kevin for being a pessimist; and George for being oblivious."
4,a fun movie,I had seen it before but purchased as a fun movie to watch on flight to Hawaii. It is really cute!
4,Better than I ever expected!,"I sat down to watch this very skeptically. I had heard bad reviews from critics- whom I'm convinced are all crabby old men. This was a delightful comedy about Jane, a hopeful romantic who is timid and kind. She goes thru a life-changing transition thru meeting Kevin, a journalist at a local paper. He shines light on the fact that she's been in 27 weddings- yet never as a bride. This is a pretty clean film too- not a lot of cussing, sex, etc. (I even loved the fact that they made Jane's boss- whom she is secretly in love with- a truly nice guy. He is a good guy till the end.) I can't wait to watch it again!"
2,Nice,reasonably priced.Good gift for work colleagues and church friends and even for family.for somewone who is sick or recoveing
2,"Good guide, but DESPERATELY needs updating!","There are precious few books available which deal with the writing and production of shorts, which is odd considering the grown explosion the form has gone through the last few years, so I almost hate to be critical of what information is available. That said, this 1994 guide is in desperate need of updating, as it does not deal with short films in the digital medium. Now that digital video has made it even easier to produce a short--not to mention that it's opened up the possibilities of what can be accomplished on film on a budget--the process of making a short needs to be addressed in the current context. In addition, with the number of internet sites specializing in shorts, and the practice of most film festivals of accepting digital submissions, the possibilities of making and distributing a short have far outgrown what this book covers. Please, Mr. Levy--give us a new edition of this fine guide!"
2,Disappointing,"I was hoping for some great Pumpkins covers. What I received, on the other hand, is an incredible cover by Pig and not much else."
4,Inferno review,This book is good for the class that we needed it for. It did However take longer than expected to get to us.
4,the basic canonical Inferno translation into english,"with very enjoyable poetics such as Ciardi's formalist rhythms & a great ear otherwise, & a dynamic pattern of rhyming the 1st & 3rd lines of each tercet instead of Dante's original terza rima. Also good notes put at the end of each canto. I think apparently this was the first really successful Inferno translation into english, & successful it definitely is, but I do think that other more recent translators, such as Robert Pinsky, have done work with it which to me is more likeable."
3,Decent,"This book was nearly as described, with slightly more damage than I had expected. Overall, it was a decent purchase."
4,The Master of Disgusting!,"Dante is truely ""The Master"" when it comes to some of the digusting torments found in the various layers of hell throughout his Inferno. I must say that this book was interesting to read and the torments were creative. One deffinatly creative torment I thought was the Wood of the Suicides! As I got deeper into the book I noticed many similarities between torments of different classifications of sins, which leads you to understand the similarities of these sins. I do admire Dante's ability to describe the horror of The Inferno, as well as his enlightenment as to what the worst sins are according to Aristotle and other analytical thinkers."
4,good,"this movie is not as good as i thought,the new version is cooler,more action of course,this movie is a bit boring the car chase of eleanor lasts for 40 minutes,i couldnt really stand it,the best scene in the movie is the scene when they check the cars they stole,a bunch of classic hot rods and muscle cars.."
4,Yes this is the original with the original sound,Yes this is the original movie before they made the crappy remastered version with the cap music and fake car sounds.
4,best seventies car chase movie made,"This movie should be re-released on video so it can be enjoyed again. I was my sons age when i watched it and knew I'd be driving a Mach 1 someday, despite being raised on Chevy's. I found it on Video at a Gastown in 1989. I shouldn't have returned it. The plot and acting were a little on the amature side but action and suspense is what this movie is about."
1,Avoid it,"Avoid this album. Every track is medicore at best. Spend your money on something else, as there are far more talented artists out there. 1 album wonder? No wonder why..."
1,Mr Lester told me!,"My brother gave me a 4gb flash drive after Thanks Giving of 2008. It fried couple months ago and kept asking to format everytime I pluged it into different system. I called Imation Technical Support (open at 9am PST) and talked to a rep named Lester. I was hoping I could get a replacement but from the noisy background Mr. Lester told me: ""I have a bad news, we can't replace your flash drive because you don't have a receipt proving where I made the purchase from."" He also suggested me having it fixed when I can buy a new one for less than 10USD. US economy was in crisis but I don't think fixing the USB flash drive is that cheap! Really dissappointed! If you don't believe me, read their warranty statement on their website!"
4,"Pretty Good, but the number of questions is incorrect","This book is a decent book. It gives you 3 practice tests, lots of practice sets, and teaches you too. However, they do mention that they don't know the question amount because the college board didn't release it. I know that the writing section had 49 questions, but they only put 38 in this book. Also, there were a few errors, but overall I'm satisfied with this book."
3,mystery monsters,I think that it is a good book because it is funny and because it is short and fun. You can laugh while you read it. The stories all have Monsters in them. I love Monsters. I like the book because it is a mystery.
2,Kajol fan,Hello every one...I am a fan of Kajol.I was happy to order another of her movies.This one I do not reccommend if you are not a Native Hindi speaker.The subtitles are horrorable...they come late and worse of all the songs are not translated...as you know if you are a fan of Bollywood Films the songs are everything!Video quality is low with this movie as well...I wish I had better review for this movie since I really like Kajol.
4,A Good Evocation of 19th Century New York,"A treat for those who like well crafted historical fiction. We get an aroma of rough and tumble New York of 1893. The squalor, disease, poverty, corruption, cynicism, poll-stuffing. Nothing like our New York, of course, where such things have been banished forevermore.While reading this, I could not help comparing the atmosphere it evoked with that in the time travel classic ""Time and Again"" by Jack Finney. That was set in 1870s New York. But close enough, perhaps, from our perspective. The Dakota building figures in both, as do other landmarks. The difference is that Soos's book gives a more in-depth study of the warts and the underbelly."
2,Still waiting,Ordered on 3-17-10. After not receiving mag I followed-up. I received a letter stating that subscription doesn't start until 6-10.
2,Good fruit cake,"Claxton is great fruitcake, and unfortunately around Northwest Ohio, difficult to come by at times. We purchase this brick when it looked like the local stores would not be carrying the product this year. The Fruitcake itself was up to standard, the issue was the price. Turns out, our local stores did get Claxton in. I could buy 4 bars (the weight equivalent of this purchase) for less than $8, which makes the price I paid for this crazy high."
4,Great all around shaver,I found this to be a great electric razor. It provided a close shave and I haven't had any problems with it. Great battery life. Recommended.
5,Great item!,This was the first time I have purchased printer ink over the internet and the first time I haven't bought the Lexmark brand. The ink was shipped quickly and has worked great. The color is good and it seems to be lasting just as long as the name brand. I will definitely be purchasing from them again. Great product and a great deal!
1,No item...,"No item. Yo no he pedido este item y no he recibido nada, alguien me puede explicar por que tengo que calificarlo? Al menos envienlo para devolverlo si no lo quiero."
4,These guys are talking my language....,"No other reviews? This book must be new.These guys come from the same background as I do (traditional Internet development with PERL, CGI, etc.) so the book is real comfortable for me.We have migrated from to traditional stuff to 'All Things Microsoft' for the sake of staying as mainstream as we can. This has meant moving to Interdev, ASP, and VBScript for our backend developers and FrontPage for our frontend folks.It has been a real challenge to work with version 1.0 (Read: BETA) of the Microsoft products and it was very refreshing to come across this book that actually points out the bugs, tricks, work arounds and ways to make this stuff sing.This book, like the Microsoft products, appears to be in the first release so it has some growing to do before it earns a ten. This is the future of Internet development however so I'm willing to put up with a the little frustrations.John Glock<a href=""mailto:amazon@webport.com"">-email-</a>"
4,Swell!,"Well, this is certainly a refreshing book. The tone is conversational, but the content is technical. However, the book is easy to use as a way to learn ASP. One thing that is a bit of a bother is the reliance on the .DLLs that ship with the book. I didn't have the time to fool around with installing examples and stuff that I can't see myself using or needing. But, you can just skip over these without losing understanding, if you want."
4,"Truly ""enlightening""","Truly well written making the reader realize how ""easy"" it could be to have a life that is happy and peaceful and that it all depends very simply on HOW we THINK. Great for anyone who wants a simple book. In its utter simplicity it has shown you that it is not difficult to have a better life."
5,Owning this book is owning a part of history...,"Poetry doesn't receive much attention these days, but once in awhile, someone makes their mark. Not only did the editor Sam Hamill, make his mark in history, but these poets did as well.The collection is a marvelous array of styles, voices and energy all moving in one direction. This should be on the shelf of every poetry lover, every historian, and every person who appreciates peace and the right to free speech.Wonderful poems to be read and to be a part of."
4,Not bad.,This was for my 8 year old step daughter. It works fine and she wanted a non pink tooth brush!
5,Great book on the pizza man.,"This book has lots of good information for any Piazza fan and i highly reccomend it to all who like him or the Mets(by the way i wrote this on october 13, so i hope he stays a Met).This book is a must for Piazza fans."
5,As good as I remembered,Really enjoyed revisiting this series. Been a long time since it was on TV and it's still as enjoyable as ever with all it's quirky characters.
5,still thought provoking,"Every episode of Picket Fences entertains me. Every episode makes me think. The plots address a wide-ranging mix of issues with a dazzling mix of quirky comedy and heartfelt drama. The questions that they raise remain as relevant as ever, in part because the writing still slices to the heart of the matter with a razor sharpness. Watch it for the comedy, the drama, the mind-bending plot twists, the social inquiry or the psychological truths. Just watch it, and enjoy!"
5,Great show...a classic,"I loved this show when it was in its original run on TV, and I'm finding I am enjoying it even more now that it's out on DVD. It's quirky sometimes, funny sometimes, serious sometimes...overall it's well worth the price. I'd recommend ""Picket Fences"" to anyone who wants to watch something a little different from the boring norm of most of today's TV shows."
4,thumbs up & out,"i've been listening to 'Hitchhiker' like crazy...what a great, great album!... the artwork is fantastic too... i'm especially liking 'Carey Ann'... i'm drawn to the voices-they have this longing emotive quality thatreels me in...highly recommended!"
4,Generalized but included good ideas,"This book gives hints and advice for any type of federal job applicant. If you're seeking information specific to an agency, you will NOT find it here. However, this book has outstanding sample interview questions- I would have never thought of them but can see them asked in any interview. Also, there are about 15 different resume formats with tips on information that federal resumes require that you would never list on a private sector resume. All in all, this book was helpful in creating a great federal resume and preparation for general interview questions. Again, don't count on it for specific agency information."
3,Works Great Dipped in Chocolate !,"I purchased this to use with my LG VX-8500. So far so good. Audio quality is good, Volume could be louder and the range is around 40 ft inside and up to 100 ft outside with no obstructions. Does tend to flop around on face a bit but i use a small piece of surgical tape on the back side to secure in place. Easy to set up and use. ""Even a cave man could use it"""

4,Inspiring,"I don't normally read a lot of running books. I have bought a couple, but never read them. I picked this up on a whim, and enjoyed it. Better than that, it got me inspired to get back outside and run. The cynic in me has to point out that there are places where Dean seems to take artistic license and other times he just seems to be bragging. In both cases my grip is minor. Overall the book was a good overview of running ultra's and a glimpse into the mind of a super endurance athlete.If you enjoy distance running or are curious about ultra marathons, this is worth the read. After this I am considering Dean's other two books."
4,Confessions of a very tough narcissist?,"There is no doubt that Dean Karnazes is one tough cat. He's plowed through all weathers, multiple continents, over innumerable mountain passes, all in search of that ineffable, ever-receding goal of the release from all pain, psychic and physical, that comes from the kind of exertion he's experienced.But, but, but. It's hard at times to get past the schmaltz. If the cheesy factor gets under your skin, don't bother. If you're addicted to narratives of addiction to extreme physical expressions, you'll be able to blast through the 'wall' of cheesiness.Overall, one gets the sense that although he's a bit self-aggrandizig, Dean is to be respected, and he is probably doing some good in the world."
2,Military Manners,"This book may be entertaining for those that don't run ultras, but for those that do, the stories just don't seem right. One in particular is the story of the two guys in the military who acted like rude mindless robots. As someone who has served in the Army for the last 22 years, I have never met anyone act like the two described in Mr. Karnazes book. I have worked with all of military services - with the exception of the Coast Guard - and also quite a few Special OPS guys. No one that I've ever met in my 22 years of service, went out of their way to be rude to civilians nor did they act like they were brain washed by the military. If the two in the book were in a ""Special Unit"", then they did a poor job of keeping it a secret since everyone already knew. Either they were posers pretending to be someone they were not, or Mr. Karnazes exaggerated.A much better book for ultrarunners is ""A Quest for Adventure"" by Dr. David Horton."
4,Great motivational book.,"Dean is definitely an amazing athlete. At times the book does make him come across as egotistical. However I enjoyed reading it and did not put the book down until it was completed and then I went for a jog. It helps the reader realize that most of us spend too much time on the couch when they're countless adventures just outside our front door. I would recommend the book to everyone, including non runners."
5,"Great book, very inspirational",This book was recommended to me by a friend. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. It made me want to run longer and harder.
5,WOW READ THIS AND BE INSPIRED: MOTIVATIONAL!!!!,"WOW WOW WOW WOW!!!Dean Karnazes has become a hero for me. I read this book, laughing and crying... THIS MAN IS AMAZING.Don't get me wrong -- I HAVE ZERO interest in doing what he does... but when I'm tired or feel like quitting or lose focus... I think of Dean running nearly 200 miles for over 2 days straight... or running through death valley so hot that his shoes melted, bread toasted, and he needed a full body suit... or running so hard he goes blind -- then keeps going!!This man is a testament to the power of the human spirit. I HIGHLY recommend it for motivation."
2,Ultrainflation,"Concur with some of the other reviews. There are sections of this book that are real page turners. Problem is, the self absorption of the author gets in the way.Karno is in love wih himself and uses running as a means of self worship."
3,just buy 1,"Nice, but average, racing car toy. unique in the character line. Big problem is that I bought all 3 (donkey, mario and luigi) and the remotes are NOT keyed differently, so they cannot race together. big disappointment for my 3 boys. overall OK toy."
4,"Excellent, BUT....","WHERE THE HELL ARE ""SOMEBODY TO LOVE"" AND ""JUMPIN' JACK FLASH""? If these made the soundtrack, this would definitely be a five-star release, and one of the best soundtracks ever (right up there with Pulp Fiction and Almost Famous). Personally, I also would rather have Frank Sinatra's wonderful take on ""You're Getting to Be a Habit with Me"", since it's infinitely better than whatever that Perry Como song is.But beyond that, the music in this movie is perfectly used. Several reviewers have noted the anachronism of the DK's excellent rewrite of ""Viva Las Vegas"". The fact that it was recorded 8 or so years after the movie takes place is irrelevant- it's used during the credits. Also, to me it was quite an apt choice, since the feel and lyrics of the song suggest a frenzied, drug-addled Vegas traveller. Hmmm... sound like anything in 'Fear and Loathing...""?P.S. After seeing this movie, you will never hear ""White Rabbit"" the same way again."
4,Favorite Things,"For everyone who searched it like me: the song at the beginning of the film is ""My Favorite Things"" from ""The Lennon Sisters"".- greetz necropolis"
5,Reach woven is the floss to use,Good stuff for flossing teeth. Easy to use and not cumbersome or plastic or waxy. Tried others and don't like waxy finish on teeth from waxy tape products or plastic picks.
3,MIXED REVIEW,"THIS CD GETS A MIXED REVIEW BECAUSE HALF OF SIDE ONE (ON THE ALBUM) CONSISTS OF SONGS THAT WERE LIFTED FROM OTHER MOI ALBUMS (TEARS BEGAN TO FALL, MY GUITAR WANTS TO KILL YOUR MAMA, ETC). BUT THE REST OF IT IS RARE CONCERT AND STUDIO RECORDINGS, AND THAT PART GETS FIVE STARS (FOR ANY FAN OF ZAPPA). ORIGINALLY RELEASED AS A BOOTLEG I GUESS IT IS NOW AVAILABLE COMMERCIALLY."
2,What the hell is this??,"As both a Punk fan and a Metal fan, I must say that this CD really sucks, especially the feeble remake of Jump In The Fire. I'd hate to hear how they would've ruined The Thing That Should Not Be. What were these people thinking when they covered these songs."
3,"Decent, but why the graphics?","These tool holders are good, but note that the '12"" MAGNETIC TOOL HOLDER' text is permanently mounted on the unit, and its somewhat difficult to remove. I thought it was just packaging. Why do they think I'd want my toolholder to loudly proclaim itself a toolholder?Another quibble is that the mounting holes are at the end of the unit, instead of above as on other toolholders I've had (the Master Magnetics Magnetic Tool Bar). That means you can't easily place these end to end. In fact the mounting bracket has so much dead space that I may cut the bracket in half and make a new hole.A much more serious criticism is that its less magnetic than the Master Magnetics Magnetic Tool Bar, and some of my tools won't reliably stick to this, but will to my Master Magnetics bar."
2,Slow going,"I made myself finish this because I had bought it. I bought it because I had previously bought and enjoyed ""While I was Gone"" but this book just didn't gel. It could have done with a lot of editing out of excess words and adding in of character development. Neither the characters nor action ever seemed to be wholly developed. I also felt that the jumps back in forth in time and the use of the present tense were done awkwardly - they came acoss as a creative writing experiment which really didn't help the story to move."
2,Hated most of the characters...,"All the characters in this book were shallow, selfish and boring. The writing was good but I could not relate to nor sympathize with any of the characters."
2,Sue Miller channels Jodi Picoult,"Sue Miller can write, and has proven that in many other books. This one, though, was excruciatingly bad. It felt like she wanted to be Jodi Picoult. The minutiae, the contrived personalities, the over-the-top characters disguised under a thin veneer of normalcy... This is my least favorite books of hers. It is light reading, but it has certainly left me wishing for more."
2,"Began well, then fizzled out.","This was truly one of the most uninteresting books I have read.It started out well but by the middle of the book I was skimming through as much as possible; I no longer cared about any of the characters.When you write page after page containing not much more than the mundane activities of daily life, and rather boring memories from childhood, you at least have to have intriguing characters and excellent writing to keep the reader interested.The background ""mystery"" was predictable and not very believable, right out of a Lifetime movie. Of course the ending didn't surprise me, contrived and downright stupid."
5,My Thoughts About Rubik's Cube,This was a gift to my son (who is now 41 years old) but when he was in his pre-teens I bought him his first Rubik's Cube and he would spend hours playing with it. So after his kidney transplant I decided to purchase another one for him and he has really enjoyed playing with it plus enjoying old memories. Thank you.
2,Piece of crap.,"Piece of crap. Much worst than what they made years ago. Dont buy. Very bad. Need to turn, twist very hard. Not for pros to play"
5,It's works,"It's works fine, when I turn the cube, it is very smooth and feels durable. What else can I say about rubik's cube?"
3,Annoyingly hard to turn.,"The stickers on this cube have lasted the year and a half I've had it, it's just the stiffness of the cube that really, really irritates me. I keep reading that it needs time to break in. Well, how much time do I need after over a year and a half of constantly playing with it? The problem comes in when I have a certain sequence of turns in mind and have it all visualized in my head, only to have that interrupted by having to reverse the cube-mid-thought-in order to place it the way I want. I certainly didn't expect one of the cubes the pros use, but I've seen other non-professional cubes turn more easily. Still, at this price, it is a good buy; however, definitely not for the speedcuber."
4,Rubik's Cube review,"I bought this as a gift for someone and they loved it! It's fun, refreshing, and a surprise gift. It still hasn't been mastered, but we're working on it. I would recommend this item."
3,Not built to last.,"My mother bought a rubik's cube back when it first came out. She still has it, and, despite being older than I am, it is still intact. It's a little bit stiff, but that is to be expected for a toy over 25 years old. THAT is how well these things used to be made.This one, however. is a piece of junk. If you're a beginner to rubik's cubes, you'll probably have no problems with it (and, in all likelihood, you'll give up long before the thing starts to show signs of wear) because you'll be doing slow moves. However, if you're more experienced (and thus making much faster and vigorous moves/turns), then the stickers will come off very quickly. I have also experienced the internal mechanism becoming too loose and having the external cubes pop off.I've owned about five of these because they're the only brand I can find locally, and they've all worn out pretty quickly."
5,Rubik's Cube-Only the REAL THING will do.,"I originally purchased an imitation cube (did not realize Amazon sold it). The imitation was cheaply made, smaller than normal, did not turn and fell apart in a matter of days.The Rubiks Cube purchased from Amazon was/is terrific. It cost as much as the cheap imitation I bought on E-bay (that was shipped from China,) thus taking 3-4 WEEKS to get here. If you want a quality item, I have found Amazon to offer exceptional products and service, both on this purchase and all the other purchases made over the years."
3,Color lables come off easily,I was disappointed with this version of the Rubik's cube. The manufacturer has glued colored papers that started to come off the second day of use. I think they should had used paint at minimum to make it long lasting.
3,tote,"Slightly disappointed, the back is not as deep or as big as I would like. However I do use it for my intended purpose. I received the item days before I expected it."
1,cheap flimsy and not worth the price to ship,"picture makes it look sturdy and quality canvas. Not the deal, cheap stitching, low quality, I would return but not worth the effort.....will use it for something....but not too much will fit inside."
3,Canvas Tote with braided handle,"This is a nice useful bag for the price, and I like its clean informal look. The pocket for water & phone are great. I've used it as a beach bag. The bad news is that the handle starts to wear out immediately, with little threads sticking out. I suppose you could make another one with ribbon, or macrame - but not everyone wants to do that!"
5,Want to know what your baby needs?,"Do you become frustrated when your baby cries and you have no idea why? Try using American Sign Language with your hearing baby to help! I started using American Sign Lanugage in my work with children and adults with disabilities in 1989, and have found it to be one of the best tools for helping those who are non-verbal communicate their needs effectively. I currently use the Sign with your Baby program professionally in my work with babies and parents as well as personally with my 7-month old baby. Joseph Garcia has compiled a very user-friendly program that will meet the needs of many new parents."
3,Poor quality,"The only thing that I like about this pot is the size. I needed a pot with these exact dimensions. Everything else is below expectations. The sides are very thin and tin-like. After the first use, the inside was covered with multi-colored stains, which do not come out. Very cheap looking and disappointing."
1,Black spots at the bottom of the pan.,It has been a month that i have started using this cookware. Though it cooks well and is of perfect size I have noticed that the cookware has several black spots in the bottom after I have washed it. It is getting more an more visible with each wash an is annoying me that Cuisinart could make such a cheap quality product.
1,"stainless steel stained in 1st use, returned for refund","We didn't even get to use this pot. We began to boil water to make rice, and rust spots began to appear on the bottom, as though there were some kind of hot spots (but why did it rust, and right away?). Sad, we loved the design and the fact that it is light weight. Not sure if we'll try again."
3,"Okay, but a little over the kids' heads","I love Helen Lester books, but this was a little over my kids' heads. Too much trying to explain and too little enjoying the story."
1,Cheap and flimsy and broken,"I bought this in July 2007. It's somewhat good looking but it's just cheaply put together. The spray limiter is near useless, the spray adjuster doesn't widen the spray enough, and last week it started leaking at the hose connection. My next nozzle will be an el cheapo no frills metal one."
2,"Misplaced Mix, Carte Blance style...","I do like the Carte Blance series. Yet I didn't care for Volume #3. Although better than the disastrous Volume #2 mix, which was only a time well spent on blah.Vol #3 is left needing a theme. The thing with the Carte Blance series, Naked Music's arraingement of lower and slower leftovers, has some keen diamonds in it. Stateless' 'Fall into You' is deep and very good. Central Living (Love that name) 'Inside' is all too hot. Kimra's 'Essential Things' is a unique but very effective cut. Very nice!The rest of the CD remains a leftover bin. I wish Naked Music would have compiled a better CD for the #3 series. The artists look out of synch in this offering - and it's not their fault.-Steve"
3,"Nice, but unnecessary.","So it's no secret that having a GM screen is important both for hiding your die rolls and having quick reference information on the other side. I you GM frequently, you should probably have one of these.I, however, have simply taken a folder and photocopied the information I know I frequently refer to from the Core Rulebook. I've even drawn a cool scene on the outer side. The screen I've made works better for me than the screen from Wizards does.However, the GM screen doesn't exactly cost a fortune. If you'd rather buy one than go through the work to make one, I wouldn't call it unwise."
4,Could Hitleer have won?,"Could Hitler have conquered Britain in 1940? How close was that country to sharing the fate of Occupied Europe?The common belief is that Hitler's failure to invade Great Britain in 1940 is inexplicable, and that the Battle of Britain was narrowly won, against overwhelming odds, by a very few British pilots.In Summer, 1940, Roger Parkinson, a leading military historian, has drawn on extensive contemporary accounts and on hitherto unpublished documentation, up to the War Cabinet level, for a new view of these controversial events of World War II, in a telling and atmospheric recreation of those four tense months of 1940.Other elements of special interest in Summer, 1940: Parkinson's account of the decision-making processes of the British and German High Commands; his descriptions of the actual battles for air supremacy; and new information on the air tactics of the Royal Air Force and the Luftwaffe."
5,A treat to read the original novel!,"I just finished Richard Tyler Jordan's delightful, illuminating and photo-filled new (2004) paperback original, BUT DARLING, I'M YOUR AUNTIE MAME: THE AMAZING HISTORY OF THE WORLD'S FAVORITE MADCAP AUNT and I learned so much about how the Auntie Mame character was created by Patrick Dennis (a.k.a. Edward Tanner) and how she evolved from the novel to a Broadway play, smash hit movie with Rosalind Russell, Tony Award-winning Broadway musical starring Angela Lansbury and finally a movie musical starring Lucille Ball. That book sent me back to the original material and I'm glad it did, because both AUNTIE MAME and AROUND THE WORLD WITH AUNTIE MAME are gems worth reading."
2,"Great Print Quality, Worst Customer Service, Won't Print CDs","The photo print quality is very good. It exceded my expectations.But... I couldn't get it to print CDs. ( Still can't using my replacement R-800 ).After over an hour with customer service, on my dime, they determined it was broken. Why this took an hour, I don't know. The transferred me to customer service and I spoke with the rudest customer support person I have ever dealt with. The print quality is great, just hope you never have a problem. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!"
1,"Great printer, but dies easily","Great photo quality printer, but ink cartridges are tiny and run about $14 apiece for the 8 cartridges needed. HOWEVER, at some point in its life one gets an error message that says ""your printer has reached the end of its service life."" At that point it locks up completely and cannot be resurrected. There's nothing really wrong with the printer; Epson has obviously got a line in its software that limits its use to so many thousand copies, and then it self-locks. I now own a piece of junk, not because it couldn't work just fine, but because it has been stopped from working ... presumably so tat one MUST go buy another Epson printer, and then repeat the process. WRONG! I will never, ever buy another Epson ... ever."
2,Printer Pain,This is my second R800 from Epson and I like the high quality prints but I am forever cleaning the print heads and buying more ink cartridges; very simply the printer should be free for you will buy it many times over in ink!
1,Paper Won't Load! VERY FUSTRATING,"I don't know how I missed the numerous reviews complaining about how this expensive printer won't load paper but I did. And now I have the same problem. The first few prints were beautiful but all of a sudden I cannot print a thing, regardless of the size or type of paper. I keep getting the same, stupid ""Media Loaded Incorrectly"" message -- no matter what I do.I'm through with Epson. I am going to purchase a Canon."
1,Don't waste your money,"Poor little Missy. Even the title is distorted: don't you actually have to PASS training in order to BE a fighter pilot? As for making history, she made it, and all of it bad for women in the military. This story didn't play in the Department of Defense (or Congress) and I guess everyone was in on the conspiracy. Now she's peddling her story to the public. Funny that plenty of women are fighter pilots today and were before Ms. Cummings, so why not Missy? Could it be lack of skill? Since she slams the investigation by the Inspector General, get the true story and ask the Navy IG for the Cummings investigation under the freedom of information act open to all Americans. You decide what's true."
1,Shisha Glass Embroidery,"I recently purchased this book because I have become interested in Shisha embroidery. I was looking for a book that would show various techniques for shisha embroidery.I was extremely dissapponited with this book. It is very glossy, with lots of colour pictures and some very very basic projects to try. The title says 'techniques and designs'. I could not find any techniques. I have not been able to find a book that shows you how to do shisha embroidery, so I can not make a another recommendation. I would recommend you save your money rather then buy this book."
3,Music Streaming Complaint,"Overall, I agree with most of the comments already posted indicating that the BlackJack is nice.Unfortunately, I came across one unpleasant surprise that you won't hear about until after you buy the phone.You can not stream XM via the browser using your existing XM account.In order to stream music via XM, you have to open a XM mobile account for an additional ~$9 a month. This is a disappointing as I was attracted to the blackjack with the expectation that I would be able to stream music with my existing account.Called customer service to make sure that I was not just missing something and they indicated that they were getting a lot of complaints regarding this..."
3,4 day trial...decided to return,"I'm a long-time BB user, but my new company doesn't support it so I tried out the Blackjack. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either and I returned it after 4 days.ProsAfter reading the manual and messing around with the phone, I was able to become pretty familiar with it in about a dayAll the functions worked wellConsShort battery life - the small one lasted about half a day and the larger one made it to about 8PM. I usually go a full day or day and a half on the BBScreen washed out in the sun...had to block out the sun w/my other hand to see the screenThe hard buttons didn't feel right and the end button next to the main 4-way control meant i kept pushing it and exiting out of programsAs I said, it wasn't bad, but it didn't wow me either. I think I'll try the Q next."
4,Great exotic read,"Good book that I actually finished (I don't waste precious time forcing myself to finish books I'm not crazy about) I love the locale of Egypt and England and the historical era. The characters were complex and emotions and history were essential to the conflicts in this book. The love scenes were wonderful and satisfying after all the suspense about it. (I hate books that build you up and say nothing.)All the characters were intriguing and I especially loved Badra. No, she wasn't a mixed breed (with a European) or noble or wealthy or anything. She was a poor regular egyptian woman with brown hair and eyes (a rarity in romance novel although it is how most people look)and was sold as a concubine. This is one of the few times I've actually read about a regular human being like myself (I'm not egyptian but I still related to her)overcoming her fears and finding love with a good man (I love that he is English and light-eyed, good contrast). I definitely recommend this book."
3,I am disappointed,"I was hoping that when I bought this lens that I would be able to get sharp vivid close-up of the moon. However, when I tried to take these pictures during the last full moon, the pictures were not that sharp and unless I am doing something wrong, I am disappointed with the performance of this lens."
1,"Wrong Adaptor, Unwillingness to Send Right One","This was my first attempt to purchase a 500mm mirror lens for my Nikon. It arrived quickly, but instead of a Nikon adaptor, it came with a Canon adaptor, even though the ad said it was for Nikon. I called the seller, who basically told me that they couldn't or wouldn't correct the problem. So I sent it back. Then I tried to buy a Rokinon 500mm Mirror. That one didn't even have an adaptor despite the fact that it was sold as being for Nikons. I am about to give up on Amazon. Certainly if I need something fast -- I purchased these lens shortly before my planned vacation -- I will not purchase where I cannot check to make sure that I am getting what I ordered. As you can tell, I am very unhappy about this experience."
3,Worth the money,"As most other have said this is not a top of the line lens and its light gathering capability leaves something to be desired. All in all I am satisfied with the cost/quality ratio.You can actually shoot this camera hand-held(if you have a steady hand) by increasing your shutter speed to minimize camera shake. My rule of thumb with a new lens uses the focal length as a guide. In this case 500MM lens I start at 1/500 shutter speed. Add the 2x converter, shoot at 1/1000. Play with the shutter speed until you find one that works for you. If you have a steady hand you can achieve ACCEPTABLE results. I don't shoot hummingbirds and flowers, I use mine mainly for surveillance and as long as I can identify the subject I'm happy.On a different note, an old Crown Royal bag filled with dried beans or rice can make a fairly stable platform if you don't have a tripod. It won't scratch your car hood either"
1,Achtung!,"A joke of ""kosmische"" proportions by the Spalax label. This is not the ""best"" of Amon Duul, either I or II, and in fact is not even the ""best"" version of either band. The music on this CD is a collection from the early-'80's version of Amon Duul which featured none of the principals from earlier incarnations (it included Dave Anderson from Hawkwind). The sound ranges from lame synthpop to meandering jams which display nowhere near the adventurousness or intrigue of the vintage Duul style(s). Further evidence of label trickery: the copyright year on the back of the CD is listed as 1972, although none of these tracks were recorded until at least eight years later. Avoid this like the plague."
3,Danze Tub Spout,"Easy to install. Flow from spout has a bit too much spray. Diverter works very well, no leakage. Not a great Oil Rubbed Bronze color as it has too much of a copper tint. While not a perfect match its close enough given the price."
1,Was sent the wrong item; Was sent an item that is almost half the cost of what I ordered,"I ordered the Eucerin Original Moisturizing Creme, price is $18.99 for one 16oz container. I DID NOT order the Eucerin Original Healing Soothing Repair Creme, price is $19.94 for TWO 16oz containers. But what I received was one 16oz Eucerin Original Healing Soothing Repair Creme. I WANT the 16oz Eucerin ORIGINAL MOISTURIZING CREME. But since this is a third party, Amazon can only refund my money and have me return the item. They can not have the item replaced. I'm afraid to order again because I'm concerned that they will again just send me the cheaper item even though I ordered the more expensive item. The item arrived timely, but what good is it for the wrong item to timely arrive?"
3,Foghorn,I received this video very fast for a Christmas gift for my husband. The only thing I did not like is that it only had two clips of the 28 made of Foghorn.
1,Disappointing.,Don't waste your money on this product. It never worked right to begin with and fell apart within the first 30 minutes.
3,Skeptic pleaser.,"Finally, a film for the skeptics! UFO's have been a focal point for skeptics for years, and, this film helps them prove their point. Even believers may doubt their own opinions after the testimony and various photos to disprove the existence of unidentified fly objects."
4,Yep...I've still got it.,"As a women over...ahem...50, I don't have the bikini-ready body I enjoyed when I was younger. It's bothered me for years...until now. In this book, Sam shows me that I can look pretty darn terrific now matter how my body is shaped. I find it remarkable that shifting my style choices...even subtly...can make a big difference in the way I look. I still won't be making any scantily clad beach appearances this summer, but I'm sporting a new confidence that suits me just fine. Thank you, Sam, for making over 50 look...and feel...this good."
4,"You won't find it in a Christian bookstore, but . . .","BARTENDER'S GUIDE ON HOW TO PICK UP WOMEN should be read by every teen-age male before he starts dating. Not that I want my son being promiscuous or even having sex outside of marriage - it is the principles author Bryan Redfield's book emphasizes that make it a must-read. BARTENDERS'S GUIDE ON HOW TO PICK UP WOMEN stresses male dignity. Too many men are too anxious to please the pretty faces, and some ladies take advantage of them. A gorgeous girl asks you to buy her a drink? Save a few dollars (and some self-respect) by politely refusing. She just wants to see if you will be foolish enough to spend money on her. You won't find BARTENDER'S GUIDE ON HOW TO PICK UP WOMEN in a Christian bookstore, but Bryan Redfield's wisdom is almost biblical."
5,Just keeps getting better !,"The developing storylines, and relationships make this the most enjoyable and thought provoking series for a long time.... and then there are the laughs. Amazing combination !"
2,"Terrible service and condition not exactly "" Like new""","I already knew what Boston Legal was. No surprise there. This was a piece to complete the series.The big surprise was the "" Like new"" listing with the discs having obvious scratches and scuffs and the box looks like someone sat on it. So far they have been playable. If not I will have them resurfaced at my local disc exchange. But like new is far from it. More like "" play with caution"".Add to that the not so speedy 3 week ship time and I would not choose RTS Media ever again!"
5,EXCELLENT,WHY IS NO ONE MENTIONING THE CHARACTER BETHANY? THE EPISODES THAT COVER THE DENNY AND BETHANY RELATIONSHIP ARE HYSTERICAL AND AS FOR ONE OF THE REVIEWERS SAYING THIS IS A WEAK SEASON I DISAGREE THE SHOW EACH YEAR KEEPS DEVELOPING AND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SEASONS. OVERALL I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF BOSTON LEGAL GET THESES DVD'S YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED
4,A gift.,I am sure it was as expected although it was a gift -- I have not heard any complaints from the recipient.
1,Truly Awful,"Could this be the worst album ever released? Perhaps not, but it's certainly the worst Hawkwind album ever made. The sound quality on this live release is atrocious, the song selection poor, and the performance quality subpar, even by the somewhat 'loose' standards of space rock. Avoid at all costs, unless you're the hardcore fan who really NEEDS to have every single release. And, if you're some poor soul for whom this album was your introduction to Hawkwind, *please* don't be prejudiced against the band's other albums because of this abomination. None of the others are anywhere near this bad-- and quite a few are downright excellent (Warrior at the Edge of Time, Hall of the Mountain Grill, In Search of Space, Quark Strangeness & Charm, etc.)"
1,What's that smell?!!!,"well, what can I say?..... WHAT A STINKER! Dave Anderson's a wanker!!! sound quality is very poor.... if ya buy it, it'll only collect dust! This is not an official release, and it sounds like someone stuffed a two dollar tape recorder down their trowsers!!!"
5,This Is His Definite Collection,"Once in a while there comes a definite collection worth of it's name , and this is one of them . Talented singer , guitar player , songwriter . You can hear he's best in this cd . Worth the wait ... Love It ..."
3,WARNING!!,This is nice to get the lint pills off of my sweaters but careful because clothes will get caught in the spinning blades making holes in clothing!!
3,Good Concept- But Many Errors,"Going through the book before recommending its use by my students, I found two serious errors in the first 25 pages (out of 290). In a math workbook, this makes the book unusable until I check every question and answer! The students must be able to rely on valid questions and correct answers.p.13, bottom: in the example for 'number picking', answers (D),(E) are identical (and correct).p.25, problem 5: no answer is correct for the problem as written (1.04*sqrt(0.079)). In the ""Answer and Explanation"" (p.27), it references a division problem.I want to use the book, but I will have to introduce it much slower than I had hoped!"
2,it doesnt teach any math!!,As a peer i wouldnt recommend this book to those that are studying by themselves. this book is a great book to go over with a private tutor or at a SAT academy but it will do you no good if you study this book by yourself. personally i had a private tutor and my score rose 480 to 680 by the time i finished this book. if you want a good book to help you study for the sat try Barron or Rocket review.
5,500 to 670 on math,"i used this book (previous edition) to get my score up.The pluses are...1) Many practice problems, and good tests2) Good explanations3) Focus on key conceptsIt is worth your time to practice.It worked (also I didn't didn't leave any blank)!!!I still have it in my shelf now that I am a senior in college ; I don't use it now, but it brings back fond memories :)The best thing is to sleep early the night b4 the test."
5,What now?,"When I first watched this series at TV I found myself so insignificant that I started admiring the tiny site we occupy in the non-imaginable universe. Some years later, after new findings, I could see the updates, with always amazing information. Nowadays, my feelings about this collection are not easily said. By now I can only say: Mankind will evolve into different shapes in the coming millions of years, if we are able to leave aside our autodestructive instinct, and will see with new eyes, day after day, the discovery of those unexplored corners. Cosmos is a Classic! What now?"
5,"Educative and funny,","It's the best television series, i'd ever seen, and can't believe it's going to come out, thank you Druyan!"
1,poor quality,"the cosmos set purchased was defective and unusable.most of the discs could not even be read by my player and thse that did were of very inferior quaity.they were made in japan,probably a product of piracy.i would avoid purchasing any similar product from this source."
5,The Best There Ever Was,"As a child I watched the original series on PBS. From there I went on to model rocketry, which my father hated with a passion. I graduated with a computer engineering degree and went on to work in the missile defense arena. Carl Sagan made science fun and made the unknown a thing of wonder rather than fear. He was gift to the human race. This series was his brightest moment in a long and distinguished career. Every home should have a copy. What a joy."
3,Great Series (Bad Copy),I enjoyed Carl Segan and the Cosmos Series when it first played in the 80's so naturally I jumped at the chance of get my own copy. I checked the specs and was reasured by the Re-mastered statement that it would be high quality video. Boy was I disappointed upon playing the DVD's. It was a major disappointment to find that this set looked like a very poor reproduction cheapo copy.Cosmos how could you defraud us fans like this.Bruce in Kansas City
5,cosmos,"the best that ever was or possibly ever will be! i have never seen one program that put it all in perspective just as only carl sagan could! delightful,informative series that really makes you look at ""the big picture"".a must for every family."
5,Maravilloso!!!!,"Simplemente maravilloso, tenía años deseando ver la serie de nuevo. Gracias a Cosmos y al Dr. Sagan me enganché de la astronomía y en general de la ciencia... hoy disfruto en mi tiempo libre con mi telescopio descubriendo las maravillas que puede ofrecer el cielo nocturno.Cosmos marcó a una generación, a mí generación y estoy profundamente agradecida por lo que aprendí de esta serie y que ahora puedo disfrutar nuevamente y cuando quiera!"
5,Good book on selling,"As Cassidy points out, there are a lot of books on buying stocks, but few on selling them. This book deals strictly with selling. The chapter ""Understand How Bad the Bad News Is"" is excellent."
2,News!!! This is the level-1 course; level-2 is not out yet!,"I was thinking about buying this course, but wanted to know what it included. The publisher also offers ""MASTERING FRENCH - Level 1"" and ""MASTERING FRENCH - Level 2"". Both are in cassette format. From the box and product description of this CD edition, you can't tell what you're getting. The answer is LEVEL 1, apparantly revised. My impression is that this is a pretty good course. But the text book has a MAJOR FLAW : no index. This means you can't look-up anything easily. My advice: stick with the cassette version. You can get both LEVELS 1 and 2. After all, you haven't really had a chance to master French until you complete both levels!"
4,"No problems, just different","We purchased and received this product with no problems and the only reason it is 4 out of 5 stars is personal preference. It's not a product flaw, it does what it's meant to do. It is simply different and as a first time user of this product it would take time to get used to. I bought these for my husband and he's not a fan just because of the wet feel, and it is at times chilly and startling. Why not try it, it will last a while, and won't break the bank. If you love it, and even if you don't it's worth trying out."
2,a little disappointing,"I was hoping for more on the actual device used as opposed to the environmntal challeenges which were ignored by our government. Not what I was hoping for. If you wish to read about our govenments ignorance, buy this book. Othewise, leave it on the shelf."
1,Don't buy this book,"I have no expirence with MS Exchange Server 5.5 and I'm trying to pass exam 70-081. I have failed to do 2 times now. Don't messure yourself againts the questions in the book and the sample test on the CD because a 100% means 50% in the real test. This book is NOT a training guide! It tells you the facts but it dosn't tell you why it's the fact. This book is more like a Fast Track book or so.This is the last exam before I will become an MCSE and almost all my other books was Training Guides from Newriders. They were good but this really sucks! IF YOU ARE A NOVICE ON EXCHANGE LIKE ME, DON'T BUY IT!!!"
5,Good introduction to Advanced Calculus / Real analysis,"This book contains most of the material you need to know, and is very detailed and ""Friendly"" !"
4,Unique Flashy Style,This is a brilliant work as a piece of art. This film is about a man involved in horrible combat when he was younger. The man explores his memories and tries to uncover what really happened. The artwork is very unique and stylish. If you are interested in art then you will be entertained. But the story itself is pretty random. If this film was live action it would be terrible. The one bad thing I need to mention is that this film is kind of a downer. It looks at war in all its horrific insanity. And the film ends showing the viewer live action of real war scenes and bloody carnage. So be ready to feel depressed.
5,The Wu saga continues....,"Excellent read!The Rza gives an indepth look inside the minds of the Wu-tang Clan and the lives they live. If you are a fan of the Wu-tang than this book is a must read. There are many good photos of the group and the Rza gets very personal with his words. Pick it up, you will enjoy it."
5,Must Have,"If you're a Wu-Tang fan, you must buy this book. I think they could go deeper in few subjects, but it is good enough for the first book."
3,Full Season Please and the Real box for it,"I have to say, fun season, with some funny episodes but I agree, don't split the seasons in half put the whole season in. My other complaint is, I ordered this actual box, not the large flat limited one with the story boards. It looks ridiculous in my DVD shelf."
5,"AWESOME, Absolutely hilarious season","Family guy Season Five is the absolutely most hilarous and cutting edge writing. Cannot say enough about this collection w/ several of my personal all time favorite Family Guide episodes coming from this season. My two favorites 1) Saving Private Brian. Brian and Stewie join the Army and go to Iraq. Hilarious and current day struggle. 2) Stewie in the tanning bed...it's not a color, but a lifesyle. Classic, as I nearly fake baked to my own grave.you will laugh for hours w/ this series. Buy it!"
3,It's good but it sucks,"It's Family Guy, It's really cool. But man, 13 episodes? Are you kidding me? They can't do that to people. They should wait a couple of weeks more and get more episodes in there. What's wrong with you, I have the whole Family Guy collection, if the next one is like this one i'm not buying it."
3,Please bring back the good Family Guy,"I am a huge Family Guy fan so it kills me to say that this season just isnt that funny. Im not saying that there arent classic moments like the chicken fight, but alot of the jokes are really becoming hit or miss with alot more misses. Do your self a favor and get a DVR instead and record the reruns. You can keep the ones you like and plus you have a DVR. Do not give them anymore money for this desacration of a wonderful show."
1,It just isn't logical...,"All issues of money aside, it just doesn't make sense to split a complete season of episodes right down the middle. What's the point? Would they rather call it a volume rather than a season? No problem--just give the consumer the entire season and call it Volume 5. I would love to hear a valid reason (other than money) to justify splitting up a complete season and the purpose that it serves. It just goes against all logic."
5,Why is everyone complaining?,"First off...13 episodes for $25 (sale price) is NOT a bad price. Have any of you looked at the prices of anime boxsets for 13 or 26 episodes? Heck, most anime dvds cost $29.95 for only 4 episodes. So please, just stop complaining, because it could be a lot worse...Second off, I'm giving this 5 stars, because, like someone else said in an earlier review, this has some of the BEST episodes Family Guy has to offer. Definitely buying!"
2,Not a work from himself,"I'll agree that Bob Dylan has never had an amazing singing voice, and if anything it has gotten worse over the years. But what Dylan did have was a knowledge of music that no one could contest, originality, and pure substance. Dylan's music was HIS music. It had meaning, color, emotions that were vivid and beautifully expressed and, singing voice or not, no one could sing his songs with the same feeling that he could.Everything that Bob Dylan was is lacking in this album. The style that was his own has been replaced with traditional Louisiana corner blues, and the meaningful lyrics that always struck the hearts of his fans have been replaced with cliche's and emotions that don't seem to belong to him. For these reasons, this album was disappointing to me and will never mean as much to me as his past albums or as Ray Charles' or Beethoven's works have meant to me."
5,Excellent album,"As a fan from the time of the ""Bob Dylan"" album, I have experienced all of the transitions Dylan has made in his long career. Some of them I liked more than others, but the changes were always intriguing and well-crafted. This latest recording is terrific, with echoes of the past, his sense of humor and his love of wordplay all in evidence. I've listened to this record many times since I bought it."
3,Not sure I get all the hype....,"I'm a huge Dylan fan, and I have every CD and record that he has released. This one is good (and better than most that he has put out recently). But, I don't think it is his finest. If you're new to Dylan, check out his ""B"" albums (Bringing it all back home, Blonde on Blonde, Blood on the Tracks, and of course, Bob Dyaln. If you're familiar with Bob, then you know what to expect with this..."
2,lame,Of his last three albums (which for some reason have been labelled a trilogy) this is by far the weakest. The other two are great.This is a bunch of blues songs and a few cowboy swing. \All kind of listless.
2,Why is this so overrated?,"I'm a HUGE Dylan fan and really just don't get this and all the hype. ""Time out of Mind"" was a mood, songs were generally good...same with ""Love and Theft"". On Modern Times it just seems that there are re-worked blues songs. Bob Dylan KNOWS what he's doing...he has songcraft ability. He can do much better. He can even sing much better...he just doesn't choose to. Dylan himself said never to give the public your full 100% effort. On this album he's giving about 25%. Of course, I bought the deluxe edition....that just means he has my ear (and my wallet). Honestly it just isn't that great."
2,mediocre dylan,"One user review says ""If you don't like it, you just don't get it.""I guess the 'it' referred to here is the notion that everything Dylan does is genius, and if you think otherwise you don't understand genius.You could just as well turn this around and say ""If you like it [Modern Times], you don't get it"". In this world view, not everything Dylan does is genius.Main problem with this album, as I see it, is that the music lacks teeth. Is it the absence of Charlie Sexton? Could very well explain the mild arrangements, but it doesn't excuse the warmed-over lyrics.Mind you I'm glad Dylan is still releasing albums rather than fading into obscurity. I'm hoping--no I'm betting--he's got at least one good album left in him. This isn't it.Best to buy the enhanced DVD package as the best stuff is in the videos, which are apparently pre-Modern Times performances. The 'Cold Iron Bound' video has more intensity and substance than all of the songs on the CD put together."
4,Best since Blood on the Tracks,"Dylan has not put out a really good album since Blood on the Tracks, he has had a few good songs on a select few albums but generally speaking his music was uncreative, dull and sophomoric.Dylan has spent most of his long career recreating himself, morphing from one person into the next and into the next, etc. Well, he has finally morphed into a sound that is more than just palatable, it is truly enjoyable. The rich lyrics linger somewhere between joy and despair, the mood is bluesy sometimes haunting. He has lost some of his voice but he does not over extend it, and his gravely nasal voice actually works relatively well with the music.I have one complaint about this album, the price is higher because of so-called bonus material. What a bunch of BS, it is not bonus anything it is a friggin ad for previous albums. Seems like Dylan fits right into the times, disrespect for the consumer...get them to pay more for nothing but another sales pitch."
5,Oh come on now,"Let's drop the pretense. It won't change the world, it's not ""deep"". This is just an excellent album by an excellent musician, backed by excellent musicians. No Hollywood production, voice under control, backup band hitting all the right notes, everything in excellent taste. If you don't like it, you just don't get it."
4,Really good album,"I prefer my Dylan <= 1966 (with some STRONG exceptions like Blood on the Tracks and Nashville Skyline), but I'd like to say that this album really rocks. His voice sorta of bugs me these days, but I think he really found a way to make the best use of its limitations on this album. I would say that this album has a roots-rock sound, so if you don't like that kind of stuff don't bother with it. But, if you do like that kind of stuff AND you like Dylan you'll definitely appreciate this effort. Worth buying just to decide for yourself!"
2,What happoned,"I'm 15 and just resently started listening to Dylan since I discovered my moms old record colection, and I realy enjoyed all his stuff. But when I picked up this ablum I was realy disapointed. It sounds like stuff my grandparents listened to. The lyrics are bad and not at all deep and the music, though played with good techneque, is just compleatly uninteresting. I find it hard to not dose off wile listening. At this point he can play anything and his record will sell but I wish he would try just a little harder."
3,(Modern) Times Are Good,"Probably the best of Dylan's latter-day albums, Modern Times sees him in fine voice (or, rather, his voice has found a comfortable niche for its diminishing range). It's a low-key effort, laid back, bluesy, and rootsy, and it's quite an achievement: I'd give this 3 1/2 stars if I could."
1,Junk,"These ""locks"" were anything but. Some would not lock. Some were locked but came open and fell off my suitcase.They are light and flimsy. I'll spend a little more and get good locks next time."
4,Great Locks!,"They're great, the feature that one key opens the whole set is the most convenient one, and it saves you a lot of trouble when you have to open your bags for the TSA people to check on them."
3,"price - good, quality - moderate","slightly disappointed with this product. i've already found replacement locks for my travel bags. this product comes with 4 small locks that are the perfect size for suitcase zippers. however, only 3 of the locks worked as advertised, as the 4th was defective from the get-go by failing to lock (it would pop open at the slightest of tugs without the key in it). i would have rated this product much higher had i not encountered the defect. maybe you will have better luck than i did."
2,A cr*p shoot,"Some of them work, some of them don't work. I used them on a trip to LA, and obviously TA went through my luggage. The lock did not break then. However, I found that only one key would work with a certain lock so I had to find a lock it would work with. Not so great, but the airlines want this, otherwise they will just pop your lock anyway. So this is a better alternative, at least you have 4 you can play around with."
3,don't stay locked!,"Out of the 4 locks I made it home with one of them! The locks don't hold up and end up opening by themselves. Three ended up coming unlocked and falling off in transport at different times, only one made it back but barely in tact! I expected more from the company but it seems very useless, I could even open them with another lock's key!"
3,Average but not great,"While these locks were indeed TSA certified, the quality is very lacking. After two uses of the four locks, only two are functional. My gun cases take two locks per case. After the first trip with the locks, one lock disappeared in transit. I was left with three locks. After a second use of the locks, one lock will no longer lock properly.These are cheap, but required by the TSA. Don't expect them to last."
3,Consistent with other reviews! 1 of 4 is DOA,"I wont spend much time on my review, since most of the other reviwers have reviewed it all.The only thing I want to mention here is their consistency in quality. Like all others have griped, only 3 of 4 units function and the fourth one is DOA. Its amazing how these people are able to maintain this 75% quality standard in all their packages! Otherwise, the product must be priced for 3 and they throw in the fourth one for free, not very useful but just to please with the number and to make up for the weight?3 stars for 3 'fairly' working units!"
3,Price is good.,"I saw many people complain about their locks are broken or disappeared after they got their luggages, so I decide to buy this product. It's cheap, and I won't feel bad if the lock is broken or gone. At least it protected my luggage. It's a tinny lock, really small. When I got the product and tested it, I found two of the locks are hard to re-lock after I unlock them (but they can still work). I guess the quality is based on how much you paid so I won't feel too bad about it."
3,Not very good description,I was looking for a TSA 007 keys! and they have this.They send everything in time and it was perfect but the description was not accurate.
3,Not the highest quality.,I bought these and locked them onto my backpack and just left them there. When I actually needed them one of them wouldn't re-lock after I took it off.
5,Really like this lock,This is an extremely nice lock works very well is not as fancy as some of the other locks but it works better. I bought both this and the other blue ones and this one i am happier with.
4,Good Value for Price,"I bought these little locks for a recent vacation and they worked fine. All four locks can be opened by the same, TSA approved key, which makes digging through luggage a breeze. The only reason I didn't give this item 5 stars was because the locks are so puny, I have a feeling they can be busted easily. But for extra peace of mind they're great!"
5,The Unit,"Love this series. Definitely worth buying. So sad they cancelled the program. Your in luck though, you need the complete series and you can get it at amazon"
4,Exactly what we expected,"Ordering from Amazon has always been a good experience for us. We ordered a used tv series that we enjoy, received it promptly and will pass it on to our kids when we are done."
3,good book for older cars,I purchased this book expecting it to be a basic electric book on modern cars It's not. It does however have a great chapter on explaining basic auto electric in everyday terms. This book is geared mostly to the antique/collector area as most of the examples are from old cars.
2,Over-production? Gimme a break!,"I don't understand what the other reviewer means by ""over-production."" This album is one of the worst produced I've had a chance to listen to in my life: the sound is like is was recorded in a garage. The only song worth listening is ""Twenty Four of Twenty Five,"" which has a very Jeff Buckley feel to it. Other than this, there's nothing else in this album..."
4,A Small Gem,"I've read just about every book written (that I can find) about paramedics, emergency rooms, and the like. Some are much better than others. This one is very short, but I really enjoyed it. It seems a bit more honest than most. Bingham doesn't try to paint himself as a hero; he simply reports on what he experienced and how he felt about it. I would rate it right up there with Peter Canning's books."
5,"Tasty, easy to follow recipes. Readily available ingredients","I have several low-fat mexican cookbooks and find myself using this one the most. Their recipes for corn bread, beans and soup are great."
1,Pesimo,"I have listened ""Rezo"", (supposed to be the best one), and I don't want to listen the rest of it, 'cause I don't want to waste my time. This CD really SUCKS!!!!Solo he escuchado ""Rezo"", y no quiero escuchar el resto, no quiero perder tiempo. Solo porque el tipo es pinta ya cree que puede cantar? Lo siento, pero no le salio la jugada"
1,This book sucks!,"There is only one book (out of thousands books I have read) I felt sick only read into a few chapters. This is it! A selfish, self-centered, narrow-minded, low-wit, and pityful heroine. I can't believe the author could even write a book about her.Writing review is normally out of my character. I believe in the philosophy that every reader should have his/her own take. But the feeling of being wasted my time of reading something totally worthless makes me take all the trouble of setting up an Amazon review account."
4,A Good Introduction to the Subject,"Cyrus Gordon goes over the main rediscoveries of various lost languages and writing systems through 1968, when the book was first published. He has some useful information that I haven't found elsewhere. I'd recommend reading this in conjunction with THE STORY OF DECIPHERMENT by Maurice Pope, which has more recent material, but it stands on its own. The speculations on Linear A are especially interesting, and not available in any other books on this subject that I've read."
2,Skip this one,"I love Alan Dean Foster's stories, so I really wonder what the heck happened here. There's a vaguely 9/11-inspired subplot that goes nowhere. The Teacher gets called into action, but then never figures into the plot. It's one thing to suspend disbelief for the hoary old plot device of the series protagonist losing his memory, but it's too much when that memory snaps completely back in place at just the right time. I guess the perfect vacation is to truly forget everything, but this book felt unfinished and pointless.The events in this book are referenced by later stories, but it's not at all important to read them first-hand here. And for heaven's sake, don't let any friends choose this as their first Flinx book; they might never want to read another."
4,It was good with a bad character and Ending,"The ending was so poor. Aswell as that I didn't have any sympothy for Link. He put himself out on the street, and made everyone feel sorry for him other than that it was an excilent book."
3,a good book with a bad ending,"Stone cold was a good book, but it had a very abrupt ending. I think that Robert should have spent more time on this part of the book. All in all I thought it was a pretty good book with quite graphic descriptions."
2,"I loved it, NOT!!","This book was a bit boring. The switch between the two narrators was not at all confusing. Using bad language was a good writing technique because it emphasize that Shelter (the murderer) was mad. It includes big words like; scrounger, circumstances and distinctions. This may cause difficulty for the younger generation and may also be disturbing.The author writes the book in a style that I've never met. He changes narrators often. This helps the reader to understand how both characters feel about the situation.To conclude I feel that this book was relatively boring, but I have learned how hard it is to live on the streets."
5,King for a day... masters of a lifetime,"you know that funny feeling when you listen to something that rings like a loud reminder of creativity, musicianship and dedication? yeah, that funny feeling is called faith no more!!"
3,What happened?,"I've had 5 years to think about this follow up to the brilliant ""angel dust"". Only 2 words come to me and they are ""what happened?"" The thing that made ""angel dust"" great was the ""live"" feel that it had. This album is too well produce and takes away a lot of the edge of fnm. It's also apparant that the band seems distracted, that's probably got something to do with Roddy Bottom being in Imperial teen, Mike Patton being in Mr. Bungle, a new guitarist(Trey Spruance, who left after recording in the studio) who was quickly replaced by Dean Menta. My point? How are you supposed to make a good album when no one is on the same page? The answer is: you can't and this album proves it. There are some stong tracks: the gentle art of making enemies, digging the grave, ugly in the morning, cuckoo for caca, and king for a day."
1,Worst Album I Ever Bought,"Faith No More was one of the first hardcore bands I got into. ""The Real Thing"" was a different sound that I had not known before. I loved it. ""Introduce Yourself"" wasn't up to par, but it was an earlier album and I liked it in its own way. ""Angel Dust"" showed progression, and although different from the others, still really, really good. FNM had a unique sound. When King For a Day was released, I bought it without hesitation. Should've hesitated. I have never been able to listen to it for more than two minutes at a time, no matter how hard I try. Blame it on the old guitarist leaving, but now they sound like absolute crap. No talent on this album whatsoever."
1,What Happened?,"Can someone tell me what happened to Roddy Bottum's keyboards on this album? It sounds like Roddy left the band rather than Jim Martin. The strong keyboard lines were a key part of the earlier albums and without them they sound too much like other bands. Maybe his keyboard parts were mixed out in post-production, does anyone know?If you want the real Faith No More get 'The Real Thing' for their more commercial sound or 'Angel Dust' for their darker sound. The latter is their masterpiece."
2,"Misleading title, but story interesting in the beginning","The title of the book is probably the most misleading one I have come across for a while, as it has nothing to do with the books contents. The cover would have you think this is a book about how to make money and give you the strategies promised on the back cover. It isn't. It is a storyline about a CEO and some friends who get caught up in some financial tricks and end up blowing the whistle in a financial thinktank called CECAR. It is designed to be a lesson in macro and micro economics. The problem is that the story is interesting at the start, but drags on and on with the unplausible existence of the thinktank (as no-one would fund such a thing) that grows in size, profile and importance to the point where there is a meeting with the US President. Get the drift ? I read all but the last 40 or so pages. My recommendation is not to buy this unless you want a few pages of an interesting story on how financial cover-ups can work."
2,For Christians Only,"I wish I'd had a recent copy of Parachute so that I could have seen this as an appendice before deciding to purchase it as a gift. This would be perfect for you, or as a gift, only if you are a Christian and don't mind having God thrust in your face and in every single sentence in the book. I wish this Christian bent had been indicated in the editorial or reader reviews. Not being a Christian, I found the book to be tiresome in that aspect and now am stuck with a book I cannot use and find annoying."
1,Not Very Useful,"Unfortunately, I cannot say that the book is worth the amount paid for it since almost half of the 67 pages are just pictures. Bolle tries to excuses himself for his Christian slant saying that it can be universally applied. However, by citing numerous passages from the Bible, he comes off as being ""preachy"" about doing this and that for God. The only thing I took from this book was that you need to take 3 steps to find and achieve your mission in life...but this only works if you believe in his version of God."
5,Read this book and you don't need to read all of the others,"It really speaks to you. To answer the criticism of some, if you aren't a Christian, sub any other higher power."
3,Eh,I would have liked to read about their time together and how she was handling things. I don't want to give spoilers but I was a little disappointed
3,Great Story,This is a great short story if you are a Were-Hunter/ Dark Hunter fan. It is to bad she didn't make this one a whole book. It is easily read in a few hours. I thought it was somewhat over priced for the 86 pages of enjoyment.
3,Interesting,"I have read most of Sherrilyn Kenyon books, especially the Dark Hunter series. I found this book intersting, but did not see as much character development as I am used to in her books. It was quick and enjoyable for a joy read, but not as good as most of her books. Still one that I am passing around to everyone in my book trading group. Happy reading."
2,Not something you'd rush out and get,"I'm totally a SK and DH fan but seriously i agree with the other reviewers that this book is best read with the other books in the anthology. Reading it on its own was rather confusing and looking as the 'thickness' of the story, SK had to skip all the interesting bits and to the story summary.sad to say, this is not worth your time as its a letdown due to its ' shortness ' creating a rather rushed story"
1,Don`t buy this!,"I want a book to last more than 45 minutes.This is not a book but a pamphlet.I love this authors books but don't buy this one, specially if you live in Europe and it cost a fortune in shipping and handling.Don't publish if you can't do better than this."
3,Average teacher guide,I didn't find this teacher guide very helpful. I was able to produce a better vocabulary list and questions from each chapter by reading the book. It just wasn't very helpful to me at all.
4,Dogsong,"Russle needs some advise and goes to oogruks house to get some from oogruk.He talks to oogruk then he finds that everyone used to have a song.Russle goes off to try and find his song.He found his song and tried to get everyone to have a song.I liked the book because it was a good book in a way, but if you like weird books you would like this one.I hated it because i thought it was stupid and had no mening to it unless you like stupid books.I liked the book.My favorite part wass when Russle rroght deer heads to oogruks house then he took out the eyes and put then in a pan, held it over a flame and when they were warm oogruk put them in his mouth and ate them, it waas the coolest part of the book.I wouldn't rcommend this book to anyone because i didn't enjoy it, but if you like pointless books then i would recommend it to you to read."
5,Dogsong,"Out of the scale frome 1 to 5, I pick 5 because the book really drew me in to the pages. Thinking about the next moment Russul could be hanging of a cliff or be face to face with an walrus. I really liked this book and encourage you to read it."
5,Great Book,"Dogsong was a great book.I think that people of all ages would enjoy this book.I could not put it down i loved reading of the hunting, and adventures.It was full of hunting, adventure, and friendship.My favorite parts were of the hunting though.I thought that it was really cool of how the boy and the dogs got to know each other so well that the dogs basicly knew where he wanted to go.I didn't have any flaws in it that really made it a bad book.It was a great book and i sugjest that you read it because you will really enjoy it.It is a great book!"
3,Dog Song By Gary Paulsen,this book is about a yong teenage boy named Russel. Russel goes to a Native of the vilage named Oograuk to seek gudence. Oograuk shows him the ways of the old and Russel learns how to survive in the wild. I think it's a great book.
2,Dogsong is not for 6th graders,I am not recommending this book to 6th graders. The story is too gloomy for my daughter to enjoy it. It also has some situations that I don't think are suitable for 6th graders.
2,GROSS!!!,This book was disgusting! It was also boring. A very large portion was desciibing killing and eating animals. Eating eyes? YUCK!!!! It was also confusing at times. A definate thumbs-down for Dogsong.
1,Book Review,The book is about a boy named Russell. Russell likes to run with his dogs somewhere in Canada. Russel had a friend named Oogruk and he died. After Oogruk died he keeps having dreams and thinking of Oogruk. He finds these snowmobile track and starts following them and finds a pregnant woman that is almost dead. In a couple of days Russell revives her and she has a dead baby.I think Dogsong is hard to understand and I really didn't like it. I suggest that people who don't have anything better to do will read this book.
5,Cute book with a good theme!,"At some time, all children want their first pet. Reading this book helps show children that pets are work and that having one is not just fun. As always, good illustrations and a nice theme that is consistent with Franklin books."
4,Very Good Overview of Zep's Best Album,"There's no doubt in my mind that PG was Zep's finest hour - 4 sides [vinyl junkies] of out and out sonic head music - incorporating funk, folk, blues and rock n ' roll. This dvd goes through every track included on the record and breaks down the structures, the stories bewhind the songs, includes behind the scenes footage and tells the story of the album's production with the engineer / co-producer at Headley Grange, Ron Nevison. A really neat film and some beautiful digi style packaging to boot.Recommended"
3,Brit-cult double feature - not bad,"A couple of OK British occult thrillers here. DEVILS pits American tourist William Sylvester against the ancient French satanist ""Count Sinestre"" (Hubert Noel) in for possession of the latter's magical talisman, which has fallen into Sylvester's hands. Despite the dark trappings, the whole affair has the Eastmancolor punch of one of the better AIP Beach Party Movies. Reds aren't just red, baby, they're RED! This finds a superior companion in WITCHCRAFT, an atmospheric black & white shocker about an centuries-old rivalry between two British families renewed when one family plans a major redevelopment of the village and razes the other family's ancient graveyard as one of their first priorities, causing its long-dead matriarch (an impressive Yvette Rees) to rise from her grave for payback alongside her devil-worshipping descendants, led by Lon Chaney Jr. Great stuff."
2,"low production as I expected, but it is hollywood's fault for not producing this kind of material...","I expected this to be uneven acting and low production values, but eventually churned out an engaging story about implications of the dl lifestyle. Like the realness of the out gay character."
2,Not for me,"I started reading this and I am not sure all the spiritual references appeal to me, so I stopped after chapter 2 I think.This may be a fantastic book, I wouldn't know, it's just not for me."
3,Not quite what I was expecting.,"This book does delve deep into the plumbing of ADO.Net 2.0, but I must admit that when I read the ""Advanced Topics"" part of the title, I thought that it would actually cover more complicated versions of some scenarios that might be found in ""beginners"" ADO.Net books such as handling many-to-many data relationships with bound controls and possibly designing and building a data access layer. While data access layers were covered to some degree, the described methods involved intensive interaction with SQL Server system tables - something I don't tend to make a practice of.The information in the book is good, just not what I was hoping to find."
5,Bobby and his Airplanes,"My husband's mother read ""Bobby and his Airplanes"" to him every night. Today he is a flight instructor and aircraft salesman. This book has a special place in his heart."
2,Too much revivalist material,"There are a lot of good songs on here but I was disappointed that so much of the album is made up of Folk Revival era covers rather than ""roots"" versions. I cannot imagine that there weren't enough Carter Family, Jimmie Rodgers, and older songs about trains for them to fill this out without resorting to pop-type groups like the New Lost City Ramblers.There are other CD's in this series, though, that are very good."
3,One simple question,"Will someone please explain why a paperback book costs $95.00?Who is censoring this product?By the way, I have not read this book. I gave it three stars because Amazon obliges you to rate it and I figured three stars was the most equitable."
1,Ignorance is evident on the cover,"The very cover of the book yells out ""ignoramus""! As anyone who has learned classical Jewish texts (ie Talmud, Midrash etc. or any text for that matter) will tell you - context is everything. From the very cover and throughout the book the author misquotes, misinterprets and distorts classic texts as he tries to pull together the weakest of threads in order to make a case to malign Judaism and its adherents."
3,Rancho Grande.,"One of mexicos early movies, the birth of mexican movies, this movie has some great senes, but somewere in the story, it got a little boring. it picks up some but overall the story was fair.if you like the to watch the birth of early cinama. then you lill like this movie."
1,wrong product!,"They sent me a measuring tape not hem tape. Read a review that the same thing happened to them, but choose to ignore it. I did not bother trying to send back since I only spent 5 bucks, and kind of wanted the measuring tape, but still not what is advertised!!"
1,Got a Flimsy Measuring Tape,I sure wish I had read this first. I got a flimsy measuring tape held together by a tiny rubber band in a plastic baggy too. What the heck?! How are they allowed to continue to do this? What a scam. I shouldn't have to give it any stars since its not even remotely close to what I ordered.
4,Good - needs more concrete exercises,"I was bullied as a child, and learned quickly that my parents' admonitions to ""ignore"" didn't work very well. So when my 5-year-old was the target of some mean-spirited verbal taunting, I decided to find out what WOULD work. The theory behind this book is excellent. Lots of good information. It was also very well-written, and easy to read. But what I didn't find, was a lot of solid, easy-to-follow exercises. It talks about role-playing ethical situations, but doesn't provide scenarios. The more concrete ideas that it does have are much more suited to older kids. So, I definitely recommend this book as a starting point, perhaps even THE starting point if you've got a bullying situation on your hands (either your child is being bullied, or is bullying, or is a bystander). But it's likely to not be the only book you'll need to read."
1,If you love this show you will boycott these DVDs,Justice League is possibly the best superhero cartoon on television and this season is probably the best. I can't believe in 2006 we are getting a non-anamorphic release. Anamorphic is everything. For those with widescreen televisions the picture is absolutly awful. Fuzzy and grainy. Bruce Timm apparently likes this better. He is either unbelievably technologically ignorant or a liar. I have lost all respect for him. Hopefully we will soon get an anamorphic release (even better would be a high def release) but this current set isn't worth your money.
2,5 Stars if not for the Aspect Ratio Debacle,"I love this series and Season 2 was amazingly well done, but I cannot purchase this product. It is just not HDTV friendly. Someone should let WB know what the future will look like. It will be, and is, HDTV. Forcing a large majority of users to zoom in and degrade the presentaion just to view it properly is silly to say the least.If WB thinks that their demographics for this product are people who don't care about widescreen and are 10 - 16 years old, then they are quite wrong.Fix the aspect ratio issue, or release a widescreen version, and I will scoop this up immediately."
4,Even better than the first season,"I've ventured along side some of my favorite DC characters steadily since the beginning of Bruce Timm's amazing run of animation. As good as the first season of the Justice League was Season Two simply outshines it in every single category.Like always, the animation itself is beautifully done and the voice work is spot on. Whereas Season 1 struggled to balance a cast of such incredible power and range, Season 2 has all of the bugs worked out. The set ends with the Starcrossed trilogy which somehow manages to upstage the Origins alien invasion (from season 1) and even ends on a cliffhanger with regards to one of the member's loyalties.Best of all, this entire cast transitions beautifully from the Justice League into the equally impressive Unlimited seasons which followed. Highly, highly recommended."
5,Awsome!!,"Finally season two of Justice League on blu-ray!! And in Widescreen!!! Thank you Warner's Bros. the picture quality is stunning!When do we get Justice League Unlimited on Bluray, please don't make us wait another 4 years."
3,As good as part 1,"This is also a great episode from a great series, however the quality of the video is somewhat lacking. I found it washed out and somewhat messy, I had adjusted my display settings for part one so they helped to make this one watchable. I reiterate my opinion that these are still worth the price per episode."
4,Awesome stories,The best thing about season two are the incredible stories that are established. In fact many of the stories that are completed by the end of the JLU run are established here in Season Two.Waiting for Time/Warner to collect the sets was definitely worth it!Due to some intense scenes I wouldn't recommend letting your little ones watch each episode.
2,costume gloves,I wear cotton gloves at night with a good lotion to cure me of my dry hands and hang nails. These gloves are for astetic purposes only as they are too thin to provide any kind of warmth or protection. They shrunk up when washed and lost any structure they might have provided. If you need a pair of gloves to wear once for costume purposes then these are about the only thing they are good for.
2,If only it was more about the elephants themselves.,"As other reviewers have pointed out, most of this book is not about the elephants themselves. I knew this going in, but as I enjoyed looking at history from the perspective of salt (Mark Kurlansky, ""Salt""), I was hoping I would enjoy ""Elephant Destiny"" more than I did. The chapters on the elephants are toward the end (chapters 18-22), and are fascinating: it would be hard for them not to be, the social life of elephants is so interesting. For those of you who are not going to read this book, or parts of it, the two main researchers into elephant behavior are apparently Cynthia Moss and Joyce Poole, and Katy Payne has a book on elephant communication. Meredith mentions elephants swimming across rivers. Fossils of pygmy elephants have been found on some Asian islands, and it is speculated their ancestors actually swam to the islands."
5,Reaffirms my Catholic faith,"This book helps me understand how important all the things we have been taught as Catholics to do...daily mass, fasting, rosary and constant prayer."
5,Princess Mirror,Products by Melissa & Doug are always worth purchasing. The Princess Mirror is fun to do. It is a creative and fun time with your child or in my case granddaughter!
4,Prefect Gift,Bought this as a gift for a girl around 7 years old. It's very cute and looks fun to craft. I plan to order more in the future as gifts because the price is affordable; especially around Christmas time.
5,purchased for my daughters,This is a great activity for little ones and they really enjoy the little magical mirror! would definately recommend this if you are looking for a fun little activity for little ones.
5,"Lucid, & by far the simplest way for better understanding",""".....it clearly shows the easiest path to the perplexed medical student, for better understanding of the basic mechanisms of pathology as well as the advanced. The various illustrations virtually pull the readers to the microscopic level of pathology....the root of disease itself. For those who seek simplicity in every aspect of learning, this book is a must-buy!"""
1,Reget the purchase,"If it were not for the the expensive in shipping the product back and that I need to transport my bikes next week, I would return the device. The supplied bolt that secures the rack to the hitch for a 2 inch hitch will only extend half way into base. In other words it goes through the hole on one side of the hitch frame and into the Thule base part way. It does not extend all the way through the base and through the other side of the hitch frame. That is unless you want to want to spend an additional 50 dollars for the locking base bolt that gives you ""extra stabilty."" This part extends all the way through."
4,Kill the demons.,"I think this one was just as great as the first book CARPE DEMON.I really enjoyed havign another demon hunting adventure and with the ending the way it was, there just has to be third in this series. If there isn't, I'll be disappointed.I do recommend that you read the first before this to get a better understanding of what's going on."
1,Outer casing cracks or Leaks too much,"I've installed 4 of these plastic units as per the directions - only HAND TIGHTEN - do NOT use tools to tighten. I assure you the casing WILL BREAK if tools are used to tighten the unit.Even with Teflon tape, careful hand tightening and proper washers, I had problems with each one. Either they leak, or tighten a little more - hand tightened - and the housing cracks around the largest diameter of the unit. Please keep in mind, this is only my experience with the product. I have since installed a brass chrome plated backflow preventer (same size) and no problems endcountered."
5,Wonderful,"To see The Shadows perform again together, and relive their younger days is quite wonderful. Their skills in their guitars and drums have not faded beyond the years. I am looking forward to buying a DVD of their show reunited with Sir Cliff."
5,Shadows-Final Tour,Wonderful cd. I love seeing the group making the music I love and hearing how the Shadows got started.
4,Useful and look cool,"But they run small! I suspect most latex-type gloves do. I wear a medium in most gloves but definitely should have purchased a large in this case. If you're unsure, buy larger. Cool gloves otherwise. Definitely suited for the tattoo artist, clean freak or spy ;)If you buy too small they stretch pretty well.. but tear at the palm after a while.. buy a size up if you aren't sure."
5,Oates Rules,"I agree with the other Oates fan, that the Hall-friendly media focused too much on the non-Oates work. Go listen to ""Mano-o-Mano"" and you will see what I mean. I thought that this album was incredibly good and the nay-sayers should take a second listen to ""Lemon Road"" and ""Deep River Blues."" Keep rockin' John and that other guy too."
3,pam,this is a cute toy. dolls are cute and once dressed they are sweet looking. but the clothes for these dolls are hard to get on. so be prepared to help younger children get all their clothes on!!
1,Disappointed Mom with Disappointed Girls,"My two preschoolers initially loved these mini princess dolls. Yes, the rubber clothes are durable and don't rip, though the long sleeved dresses are nearly impossible to fit on the Ariel or Sleeping Beauty dolls (long hair gets in the way). But my girls have already managed to pull the heads of 4 dolls off, as well as one leg and one are off of another of the dolls. I've spent a fortune replacing each broken doll. The girls were merely trying to put the dresses on, when the heads broke off. And once off, the heads can't be reattached. Then all you have on your hands are sad little girls, wondering how quickly mom or dad will get them new ones. Good idea, but very poor construction."
4,Grand-daughter loves it!,"My grand-daughter just turned 4 and I sent this to her for her Birthday Party - which was a tea party for little girls!! The present was definitely a hit! I would only suggest a small clear container to hold all the small pieces, be included. I live 10 hours from my grand-children and Amazon is quick and dependable and makes my life much easier."
2,hard to dress up,My 3 year old loves the dolls but she can not dress them by herself and I have to do it all the time. It is very hard to put the dresses on.
1,Big let down,"Just the fun and cute set my 3 year old was looking for, but after only 2 hours of play, half of the princesses have lost heads! Reading the inconsistent reviews, I'm totally confused. I wonder if it depends where/when these are bought and/or manufactured. I will be contacting Mattel directly to see what they suggest. I'm also frustrated that they haven't come up with a way to make the shoes stay on better, but that also seems inconsistent for reviewers. As a major toy producer, Mattel should have higher production standards, for sure."
2,As a fan of the Muppets I was disappointed,"I have tried to collect most of the standard Muppet shows on video where possible. This was terrible. Now a lot of it is because I'm an adult, and this one was aimed at children. However, the original Muppet Show was a mix of stuff aimed at the family and some adult humor as well. This had none of the adult humor, and was very disappointing. I gave it to a friend who has children, and they apparently love it, but it makes him crazy."
1,BAD JUDGEMENT BY DIRECTOR.,My wife and I picked the DVD version up for our almost two year old son. We liked the trailers shown on the Bear in the Big Blue House series we have and thought our son would enjoy Kermit. BIG mistake. Near the end of the movie one of Kermit's frog pals is strapped down on a table for disection and has a near rabid Biology teacher holding a razor sharp scalpel to it's throat while it squirms in horror. I all but yanked the power cord on the TV to prevent my son from seeing anything further. I am very glad we monitor what our son watches. Who would have expected such a stupid move on the part of the Henson group? Parents beware. I like many Henson products. This one is banned from our library.Andy's Dad
2,Not very good,"I didn't really care for this movie at all. I guess it's worth watching just to give it a chance, but it doesn't have a spot in the line of Muppet movies. I couldn't believe they actually used CG shots in this movie!"
