3,Listenable Les,"Les Brown's music is as American as mom's apple pie; and always listenable. His sound is mainstream without being too commercial. The Les Brown band is a more modern version of Larry Clinton's band - who Les arranged for in his early years. Les always used high caliber musicians. He really made a mark with his 1953 Coral recordings: ""Les Brown: Concert At The Palladium"", volumes 1 and 2. The CD title ""Best Of..."" is misleading. It is the best that the Les Brown band offered in that year (not given) but not a genuine retrospective. Worth buying anyway. He's playing some good tunes."
4,Very Convincing,"While the theories of his other books of this genre (namely that Jesus and Moses were Pharoahs) are far-fetched in my opinion, this theory of Joseph and Yuya being the same person appears spot-on. The details fit together almost as perfectly as one could expect considering the language and culture barrier between Hebrew and Egyptian. I am convinced.My only complaint about this book is that the author makes a few unwarranted assumptions, most notably about the nature of Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac, which seem designed to promote the entirety of his theories about the origins of Israel and Judaism.If read as a stand-alone theory concerning Joseph, this book is very convincing."
3,Fading fast,"I love the design of this bed. I have a very large dog and it suited her size perfectly. However, after only 1 wash and a little use the fabric is coming apart and the material is faded. Also, the stuffing mats very easily. Not a bad bed for the price but wanted it to last longer!"
1,Such a disappointment after all the positive reviews!,"I had high hopes after reading the reviews.She may have talent but it is hard to tell, she never seemed to reach very deep, leaving me feeling like this CD was phoned in.Nothing stands out moving from one song to the next."
1,Watch Out For Ulcers or Internal Bleeding,"This is what aspirin is made from. It does what is says it will do (it really helps with pain and stiffness), BUT it can also cause internal bleeding or ulcers. I would recommend using SOMETHING ELSE for aches and pains that doesn't have those potential side effects, such as T U R M E R I C. Turmeric does the same thing but has few side effects. Turmeric can thin the blood a bit, so you want to be careful if you are already taking blood thinners or if you are pregnant, but otherwise Turmeric does the same thing as this without the worries.If you take White Willow Bark and you get abdominal pain: STOP! If you start getting TIRED: STOP! You may have internal bleeding and not even KNOW it, which is WHY you are so tired! AVOID."
1,Blue Cold Bell Peppers,"This band must be marketing geniuses and/or appeal to an ignorant audience, because they have been nothing but a supreme disappointment for years now. This latest offering is just terrible. I'm embarrassed for them when I hear one of their songs on the radio. My 4-year-old son tells me what a bore they are. And it's true. The songs are inept, lack any substance and Anthony's voice is weak and pathetic.At least their very early music (backed up with exciting stage shows at the Rainbow Room, Whiskey, Madam Wong's, etc.) had some teeth and excitement to it."
1,Two boring hours,"I really can't believe so many people are totally blown away by this album. Is it cos for all of them the name RHCP means so much? Or cos of the inability to distinguish something outstanding from mediocre? I suppose both. I wish the band hadnt released anything at all and remained one of the greatest bands in the history of rock than realeased this album. It's too secondary in comparison with the previous 4 albums. Absolutely nothing new, the same melodies, the same harmonies. Yes, the sound is great, but no creativity whatever. A huge disappointment..."
2,I Just Don't Get It!,"Why was this CD, with monotanous lyric cadences and rhymes with the same sounding uninteresting beat throughout, in the running for a Grammy?? Beats the heck outta me."
5,"Yes they have finaly brung back ""Red Hot"" in the chili's!","Blood Sugar Sex Magik, is with out doubt probably one of the best albums ever produced. So what do you expect? To see them make a copy of it?No the Red Hot Chili Peppers aren't like that, every album is differant (Its Is!).BSSM - Pure Funk, and the odd nice slow track.OHM - Mmmmmm, not to good, I can't really tell what genre this is, some good atempts.Californacation - More slow, I would not say Pop, but I would not say rock (well its more rock then pop.)BTW - Pop, Melancholy.SA - Melancholy, Pop, Funk, Acoustic.See, SA has got loads of differant genres, so its not like Californacation or BTW.This album is like, abit from BSSM, abit from OHM (SA has got a couple bad songs.) abit from Californacation, abit form By The Way.And do not tell me, this album is only filled with BTW because its not, its alot differant, you just need to listen, maybe that would help.This is my second favourite RHCP album, and may climb.Buy It!"
4,"Better than By the Way, but Californication is still better. (4.3 stars)","The Red Hot Chili Peppers have always been an enjoyable band and a good source of musical stability. Stadium Arcadium just didnt quite live up to my expectation.This album is mostly slower more mellow songs. Which is fine, and very relaxing. I would have just liked them to have changed it up a little bit speed wise. Thats the only thing that really hindered it for me. All in all this is a very solid, enjoyable, and relaxing album (also very good for makeout sessions lol), but just not their best. Im very pleased though, and it was worth the money."
4,wow,"I'll keep it sweet and short...This is how a double album should be. It's Californication and By the Way smashed together but more mature, a little funkier (as RHCP should always be,) and just plain better."
2,"Heeey Yooo, This is what I Sayooo?","Your kidding me, right? I thought I would never NOT like the Peppers music, but I'm there! Has Anthony been taking voice lessons in a room with scented candles, an area rug and herbal tea? They need to visit that house that they recorded BSSM in or go back Under the Bridge. I am not inducing past habits so please don't attack me. It's a euphemism folks. It's almost sitting in the doctor's office' music. What happened to Flea's bass? Did he suffer 'Kirk Hammett'ism? I actually heard the entire cd from my brother who's also dissapointed in wasting 14 bucks. Let's Resurrect Hilal! Keep John, he's still a great guitarist but they need that fire under their tails again. They can keep this crap!FISHBONE STILL RULES!BROOKLYN,S T A N D U P!"
3,Average,"I have been a big rhcp fan for years now, everyone seems to have different favorite stages of the band. The way I approached this album was starting at Blood Sugar, Californication, and By the Way. In relation to those, this album is probably the worst. Thats not to say it doesnt have some decent songs, but the overprocessed mixing and trite funk licks barely posess the same raw energy the band once had. Albeit, there are 28 tracks and I'm sure everyone is bound to find a handful of favorites. I would recommend it to any fan, but it is defenitely no masterpiece"
2,Red Hot Chilis go cold.,"The Red Hot Chili Peppers are juet getting too old to pull off the ""young punks"" act anymore. Unfortunately when you slow down punk to make it ""adult sounding"", it just soulds flaccid and dull.The RHCP need to face reality: they need to retire gracefully or face an mbarassing and tortuous slide -- like a lot of over-aged 1960's and 1970's burnout bands that are still around.The CHILI PEPPERS had their run, but on this, the heat is gone. This reminds me a lot of the 1980's albums that The Stones and other bands put out: one or two good songs, mainly a lot of dull filler."
5,muy buen disco,yo no soy muy fan del rock pero este cd es muy bueno hasta los rhcp dijeron que lo mejor que hanecho el nvo sinlge tell me baby esta muy suave vale la pena comprarlo digan no a la pirateria
5,amazing,"every song is amazing, i can't even name a favoritebecause they are all my favoriteeverything about it is good"
4,Good Stuff,"I'm not really a rock fan in particular...I choose hip hop first. However, I'm a RHCP fan ever since Blood Sugar Sex Magic. They did a great job with this LP, and I always am relaxed when I play it. The lead single and Hey are my favorite tracks. I think they didn't stray from their sound in this album, so loyal fans should be alright with it. The bass licks are unbelievable...I only wish I could do that."
3,Mainstream fare and overrated,"I tried my best to love this album. I really did. But, I just couldn't bring myself to do it. ""Dani California"" and ""Snow"" are phenomenal pieces of work, fusing together rock and roll and other genres together; however, as a unit, this album is really the epitome of unremarkable. No, it's not bad. By any means, but it simply does not give a pleasurable listening experience, unlikeCalifornication (Bonus Tracks)which as an album was much preferable.To be honest, the best way I gauge an album is the play counts in iTunes. Right now, excluding ""Dani California"" and ""Snow"", which can both be bought separately, I've listened to each song maybe two times. That's not for lack of wanting to try them, but more out of sheer displeasure at them. Compare this to Californication, which I've heard all the way through dozens of time, and you can see just how this album was far too overhyped.It's not unpleasant, but it certainly isn't anywhere near as good as I had expected."
2,Calicrustication,If Kiedis mentions California whether in a song or a song title one more goddamn time I'm gonna force feed him fish tacos until his motherfcuking stomach bursts and spills toxic effluvia throughout his chest cavity. On top of that the music is lame with nary a hint of the old sweatsocked Chili Peppers energy in evidence. I'm glad I stole this cd from my girlfriend's baby daddy cause my job at the All American Burger just doesn't pay enough money for me to waste it on these bolillos.
3,"Easy to listen to, but not particularly memorable","Lots of enjoyable tunes, but not many really ""stick"" with me. This album has a fairly pop music feel to it. While you can't really point to anything wrong with the songs, they don't really speak to you either.It's worth the money but don't expect to be blown away."
2,Sad/Are you oblivious?,"Well, if you like uninspired, recycled Chili Peppers in overabundance...YOU'LL LOVE THIS ALBUM! I mean, really...this is gruel. I urge you to rise above the wretched haze of american pop-culture, and relocate/re-establish a natural identity. For the record, I thought the large of their work previous to this was good music! Anthony Kiedis is a brilliant person, there's no excuse for this album. Just as there's no excuse for ignoring that little voice of wisdom that says move on. ...but they are indeed now richer from having made it! Yes. Monetarily."
3,A great band betrayed by nonsensical lyrics,"Stadium Arcadium frustrated me. I really wanted to like it, despite the good case made by Flea, John Frusciante, and the underrated Chad Smith. But, my ultimate opinion of Stadium Arcadium is due to Anthony Kiedis, the band's singer. Don't get me wrong, Kiedis is great live and his vocal delivery is energetic and passionate. But the songs don't mean anything. The lyrics are a pastiche of nonsense, and the act wears quickly. Take ""Charlie,"" the third song on the first disc: ""You could do at the hippodrome/slide back, trombone/ anybody got a tv tome?/ That's right, unknown."" I have no idea what this means, and I don't think Kiedis really cares to know, either. The RHCPs have a great album in them, but until they start focusing a bit more on their lyrics, their promise will always be just that."
3,Fun toy but stuffing comes out of legs,"My daughter likes this toy and I bought it to play with in her car seat, since it doesn't have any hard parts. The problem is that the stuffing is coming out of the legs. I'm not sure if others have noticed this, but I regularly have to check her hands to see that she's not eating the long strands of nylon. Otherwise I'm happy with this toy."
3,Does the Job for the Price,"Overall, just what I expected for the price I paid. The unit keeps an adequately cold, even tempurature, and the freezer section doesn't require defrosting very frequently (I went a whole year without a problem). Storage on the door and inside is adequate, and the construction's not too bad.The downside is that it does get noisy when it kicks on - it sounds kind of like a flock of pigeons. I had this in my office and when it would start people would ask if I had a coffeepot under my desk or my stomach was rumbling...it's that sort of sound.Again...for the price, it delivers, but the noise is a lot to deal with."
3,Works OK...for awhile,"We bought this refrigerator about 2.5 years ago to keep cold drinks in the basement. It worked fine for that but after a short while, the freezer condensation would leak and I would often have to mop up water in the bottom of the fridge. Tried defrosting and starting over but the leaking persisted, it got warmer and finally died. So if you plan on buying another in about 3 years, this is acceptable. I'm searching for a better brand even if it cost more."
1,A NIGHTMARE!,"AVOID THIS COMPANY!! My Freezer arrived broken. Haier customer service was rude & obnoxious. They were completely unapologetic & seemed to go out of their way to be UNHELPFUL. When I finally bullied them into action, they wanted a full week to send out a service man who may or may not have been able to fix it. I spoke to both customer service and corporate, both were extremely rude and entirely useless. What's more, neither one had the decency to so much as apologize. NEVER AGAIN.This was every internet buyer's nightmare!"
4,Hoagy Carmichael Sings Stardust and His other great compositions,It was precisely what I was looking for. I have heard Stardust thousands of times but never as the composer had meant it to be.
1,the meter stay in 7,i am not sure if the meter is working always stay on 7 most of the time. what is the issue? is it not workinghow is the reading is it correct?
1,Always a 7,I used this pH tester on my garden soil and always got a result of 7. Since I work in a laboratory I borrowed a few drops of pH standards (pH 4 and pH 7) and tested with this pH Meter. Both came up as 7. Hmmm! Don't waste your money!
3,could be better,"When the PH falls between the numbers it's hard to be anywhere near accurate. It works if the PH range for your plant is broad but if it is a narrow range, then it's a guessing game as to what the meter is actually showing. Is the hash mark between whole numbers supposed to represent 1/2. 1/4 or what?"
1,Rapitest PH Meter review,"Could not get this meter to work properly.Checked with 4.01 calibration solution that I use with my Hanna digital ph meter (which works quite well but not on soil) and it wouldn't move off the 7. Cleaned probe as mentioned in other reviews (I used emory cloth) and I did get it to move but only to 6.5 in the 4.01 solution. My opinion on this product is that it is junk, if you have a ph dependant plant as most are this meter could kill it!"
4,"straightforward, solid","Mike Reeves is an inspiring figure. He demonstrates the Bo well (several angles) and threw in a Sai form. The Bo forms are not flashy but performed right at you, no dancing around. He speaks English (no dubbing or text). The only complaint I have is a few times the camera doesn't catch his feet (stance) as he works."
5,Worth the price,"Recently skated them with Bones Red bearings. It was a nice smooth ride. I usually skate 52mm and with these i could feel a lot faster. Soft, high quality wheels."
5,One of the best of 2000.,"This is a fantastic album, by a fantastic singer. Much more melodic than Archers of Loaf, the Crooked Fingers album takes you to emotional depths that are rarely round in any music. If you have even the faintest curiousity of what the former lead singer of Archers is doing now, or enjoy fine music, don't hesitate to get this album."
2,Not that great....,"Only one really caught my attention in this series, the Antietam bit and the Gettysburg address. It was quite interesting, the pictures were good and the voice overs were spot on to what I would expect. The rest of the mini series had me scratching my head and turning off the show before it was over. It made no sense to me, totally off from what I was expecting. You wouldn't even see anything from what they were talking about, just the before and after. Like the Evlis bit, they talked about rock n roll before Elvis then after but they didn't show the moment that he changed tv and rock n roll. Everything seemed pointless, a waste of time.Some of the topics make sense when it comes to changing the world and the people in it but the director and writers did such a piss poor job getting it through to us, it was like getting a tooth pulled just to watch it. If they want people to be interested in different things History related, make it a little more interesting, please!"
2,This is one ring only!,"I expected 3 rings as described (""Flower Pot RingS) and as shown on the picture but received only 1. I did not return it because the ring is OK."
1,Disappointing,"i had low expectations for this book right off the bat when i received it as a gift. Unfortunately, my expectations were met. There's nothing particularly new or interesting in this book, just a dreary rehash of what many others have already said better. There are other better and better written and cheaper books on hemp out there."
3,No English,The directions for these tests didn't have a word of English on them. They don't seem to be any different than an aquarium test kit. The only reason I could figure out what to do was because I have messed with dozens of different aquarium water test kits. They do seem to work though.
3,It is what I had expected,"It was exactly what I paid for so I'm happy, nothing more nothing less.Six more words required oh well I'll keep typing, the weather is going to get cold - 20 degrees by Monday!"
4,It Works,It seems to work Great care must be taken in opening the capsules as they contain a very loose powder and the aim is to put them in a very small hole. I recommend doing it over a plate so spillage can be recovered.
1,Don't Take a Chance!,"If there were a zero star option it would have gotten it. I have to say, I am more than disappointed with the quality that came with this toner. Not only is this a terrible and useless cartridge, but it's the second one that I have received being that I already returned the first one that had the same issues. As the first reviewer says, there are black marks on both sides of the page and when you hold the pages you get toner all over your hands. Any type of picture or photo has giant gobs of toner and the roller on the toner cartridge is covered in toner. Do yourself a favor, spend a few more bucks and get a toner cartridge that will work. If the company would like to try and rectify itself again, I am open to it, and I will rescind my review, or at least reconsider, but I have to say I have my doubts as this is the second time that I have tried to get a cartridge that works."
5,Gabby shoe the best!,"It's a real challenge to find hot, sexy shoes that feel good for lengthy wearings. However, this shoe offers both comfort and good looks for me! I like them so much that I've bought this style in four colors. They go as well with jeans as they do with dress-up attire, and I can't say enough good about them. The one warning: don't wear them when traversing cobblestone streets (as I did by accident in London's Covent Garden area) because the kitten heel gets stuck. But on normal pavement, I can walk and walk and walk, and they still feel great."
2,Classical Guitar,"Alright, I'm 17 years of age. I play better than the skill heard in this album. Odd..."
5,quality paint,Great finger paint---buy all the colors---great contrast for mixing or on their own as primary colors.
2,The Author Begs to be Pilloried,"When I picked up A Crooked Man, I figured it would have to be well done, since it is written by a literary critic. I agree with the one editorial reviewer who advises Mr. Lehmann-Haupt to keep his day job. The plot is interesting enough, the politics of strange bedfellows, personal tragedy of the Senator's daughter's suicide/murder? leading to the Senator's interest in the war on drugs. However, the author seems to employ every cliche possible on the long rambling trail to the obvious conclusion. Even when the evil doer is exposed in a diary, the Senator doesn't seem to grasp the identity. He is not the brightest bulb and in that sense, perhaps the senator does mirror our current politicians. I believe the author tried to reach beyond his current abilities. His characters seem one-dimensional and scattered. Something less ambitious may be better until he gets the hang of creating it, rather than tearing it apart."
3,Come on Guys there were some funny parts,the chipmonks had me on the floor and the singing and battle dancing was funny. We watch these movies to laugh and they are MEANT TO BE STUPID and FUNNY. That it was. If Im drunk lol I would watch it again. lol just remembered I dont drink.
1,Are you serious? Why was this made,I didn't laugh once! This movie sucks! Like what the heck were those morons thinking making this crap. It's not funny having random celebs and movie characters pop out of nowhere and say something stupid. people who enjoy this s#%* A. Have no taste in film and B. are like 12 years old. That's why these movies keep on getting made because the 12-14 year olds keep paying to see them at the box office! worst movie ever! I'm applaud that people on amazon gave this a 5 star rating... What the hell?
1,"""Stupid"" does not equal ""Funny""","""Farce"" is outrageous and over the top humor that can make for an incredibly funny spoof or satire. This movie is just plain stupid, and the director can't seem to tell the difference.I'm usually stubborn enough to force myself to watch any movie I've gone to the effort of getting. However, this one was such a dog I could only force myself to watch 20 minutes of it before ripping it out of the DVD player."
3,"Yes, there was funny parts","Disaster Movie looked like a box office dud from the trailer. I'm sick of all these spoof movies and I didn't think we needed one so soon. Diaster Movie, like Meet The Spartans, is saved my former MadTv alums. Namely Nicole Parker as the Princess, Crista Flanagan who stole the movie as Juney and Hannah Montana, and Ike Barinholtz who played a slew of roles. Most of the parts without these stars were pretty dull. I watched the film for free but it was worth watching once. The song at the end was a parody of I'm Fu&() Matt Damon and that was funny. However, don't waste money buying it for more then three dollars. Give this movie sometime and it'll be down to a penny in no time."
1,A list of things that are better than this movie:,"1.) Root canals2.) Rectal exams3a.) Paying taxes3b.) Getting audited4.) Rush hour traffic5.) 18-hour work days6.) Benign tumours7.) The ex-wife's lawyerI could go on. My 8-year-old nephew was watching this movie, and halfway through he turned to be with a wrinkled face and said, ""This movie sucks."" No kidding. Even an 8-year-old can understand the difference between good parody and bad pardody. I told him when he got older we would watch some Zucker Brothers movies together. That's the only reason why I saw this movie, in case you're wondering...because of the kid. I was in the room. I took a peak. I was going to tell my sister what her son was watching, but the boy didn't seem all that interested in pursuing this pile of tripe till the end. Besides, I figured it was a good life lesson for him: sometimes, experiences are painful."
1,Self-descriptive,"The title of this film, ""Disaster Movie,"" is truly a self-description. The makers did spend a lot of money on this flick, which means there is a tiny fraction of quality to the production, but they forgot the rule that ""crude and raunchy"" does not equal ""comedy."" There were no memorable lines or jokes, like the one from ""Airplane"".""I am serious...and stop calling me Shirley/surely.""If you are a low-brow Neanderthal, young American male, you make like this movie. Everyone else...don't throw away your money on this flop."
1,Worst Movie EVER!,"I like most movies I watch, and try to find a good side of them all. Sometimes I think that they are overrated; and sometimes under appreciated. But this film was the WORST!!The jokes were badThe humor was simply grotesque (women lactose jokes, water breaking jokes - not funny)The parodies were badA weak and poor storyline.I am quite a fan of some satire films, particularly the Scary Movies. I'm all for slapstick humor, like Naked Gun or Hot Shots. But this film is horrible. At least it is only about 80 minutes long - but it was the worst 80 minutes of film to ever be released."
5,So Good!,"We bought this as a gift for a nephew. At the low price, I was worried it wouldn't be well-made or sturdy enough to last. I was wrong. After assembling this (which was quite easy, took about 20 minutes), the final product came out strong, sturdy, and great-looking. Everyone that saw it was impressed with its appearance. It will take wear and tear, the hair is surprisingly high quality, and our nephew loved it! Hard to find a long-term heirloom for under $100, but this qualifies for sure."
5,Beautiful Horse,I absolutely love this rocking horse. It made me and my daughter smile ear to ear on Christmas morning. It is very good quality and looks really nice. The only thing is that the handles connect in the middle with a screw. They don't really stay tight so they have easily stripped the wood. I haven't figured out how to fix it yet.Definitely a classic playroom toy. My 5 year old even loves it!
5,Does what it needs to.,I use this for illuminating my turntable; it is well-built and attractive. Do note: You need to buy the base separately from the rest of the lamp; the listing on Amazon does not make this as clear as it might.
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this Biography DVD. It is an old show, and it shows in the ebb & flow of the program. My husband is a Earp Brothers fan and turned it off after the first 20 min's."
1,Harsh on Sensitive Skin,"Unfortunately, this fade cream broke my face out. I have sensitive skin so I knew when purchasing I was taking a risk."
5,BEST ALL AROUND KNIFE BOOK!!!!,"This text is the only one I know of that takes the reader through all aspects of knife selection, usage, and maintainence.Everyone who uses blades on a regular basis will profit from the info contained. Even if you do not use all of the techniques that Paul reveals, the expanded knowledge of what your knives can do for you makes the book well worth the purchasing price. As far a discussing brands, Paul is smart enough to avoid jumping into the fray, as the market is so crowded and companies and styles come and go frequently. He merely discusses features to look for depending on what you are mainly going to be using the blade for."
5,The Definitive Guide,"If you're considering a backcountry trip to Isle Royale, this is the book to have. It covers everything you need to know to plan a trip to IR: how to get there, campgrounds, trails, lakes, portages. Plan your trip with this book, and carry it along in your pack!"
4,"The album is incredible, but GO FIND THE LIVE STUFF!","A couple years ago, I heard various recordings my brother had found of Howie's shows. I became addicted before I even knew there was an album. Though Austrailia, is a good starting point, it doesn't even begin to show off Howie's full potential. While on stage, he literally orchestrates an improvisational song, creating his own beats, and guitar riffs. It just all melts together and gets inside your head. I'm not sure why John Mayer has taken off, and some folks are in the dark about Howie... but just put down the Mayer cd, and go find out what Howie is all about.I would suggest going to furthurnet.com and downloading some of Howie's shows. It's easy & free."
1,A fine example of an author taking on too much.,"By page 35 (the point at which I abandoned the book) it was evident that there was no sorting out the slew of characters, agencies, acronyms, bad guys, missions - just no sorting out the book, in sum. It should have its own companion guidebook to assist the poor readers who try to slog through it."
5,Lovely perfume,"I absolutely adore this perfume. My sister-in-law was using it at her last visit and I immediately needed to have it for myself! The price is very fair for the amount of perfume you get, and it is just a very lovely and complimenting scent. It's not too heavy or sweet, but also manages to make a statement."
5,Great.,"This is the easiest to use product ever...You don't even need all of it. If you mix a little bit, instead of all of it, you can make one box / bottle last you 4-5 colorings..I use dixie cups in the bathroom, and I put a little bit from each bottle, and then mix it with my finger. Dump it on your head, in the shower, work it in...and you are done. I have Blonde hair , and this is a happy medium, between blonde and light brown."
5,HAVE USED THIS FOR YEARS.,THIS IS THE BEST MEN'S HAIRCOLOR. I HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS. IT LOOKS VERY NATURAL. I USE IT EVERY 6 WEEKS
3,Works great,"This is a great product to cover up mens gray hair, however guys usually don't have a ton of hair and therefore the amount of product they put in one bottle is a waste. I think I used like a 1/8 of a bottle and since you can only use it once, I had to throw the rest away. I'm trying to figure out how I can use this product twice to get more use out of it. Overall, it is a great product and works wonders to hid those grays. It makes it look very natural!"
3,Probably Should Buy in Person,"It's tough to know if you've got a color match with the small pictures on this site. It's easier to hold the box up to your head & have someone else be the judge. Also, a little more to it than just shampooing it in. You may want to have a professional do this for you to get the roots, tips, etc."
4,Just like I was there,"For any one who is really interested in Africa this is a good read. It is not the usual safari book written about the glorious hunts of a ""Great White Hunter."" This is a book by a man who literally made a large part of his life in the wilds of Africa hunting and collecting all forms of wildlife. The sheer humility of Kalman's writing makes you fell as if you were setting around a campfire after the hunt discussing it leisurely. There is nothing overblown or braggert about the man. I did get a little bored with some of the detail he went into on the smaller animals and birds, however it is just this attention to detail that makes him so worthwhile to read. Overall I found this book to be both entertaining and informative."
2,Adljustable storage system.,"Really felt the unit is kind of cheesy. Not exactly what I was thinking. I wanted to hang rakes, shovels, etc as well as some other assorted things and don't feel it is really up to that task. Will use it for some smaller items. The plastic pegs are in my mind kind of useless. Think I would have been better off spending some more, putting a 2X4 cross piece and screw in holders for my tools."
5,DYNAMIC DIANA,"Diana Ross excels in her dramatic silver screen debut playing thelegendary jazz and blues singer Billie Holliday in a sometimes true,sometimes fictionalised adaptation of Billie holidays novel of the same name. The soundtrack is magic as Ross sings this admitedley in her own special style but does it so much justice you can't complain. Billy Dee Williams and Richard Pryor are also excellent as the supporting cast. The atmosphere is tense and gripping throughout and Ross plays the singers physical decline into heroin addiction with such realsim you can't help but question why she never received the oscar she was nominated for. On the whole thoroughly excellent and a classic well worth having whether being a Diana ross fan or not."
1,Do NOT watch this one,I just think this movie s....BIllie WAS one of a kind and Diana Ross does not match her in any way and definitely not in interpretation her way of singing.Save your money or rent it - if possible.
4,Very Entertaining,"The music is excellant, and the story is poignant. Diana Ross had never done a better showing. Watchers should keep in mind, however, that this movie is not entirely factual."
1,Bought and paid for scientist,"I wonder how much the YEC's (young-earth craetionists) paid Faid to write this creationist crap. Well, on other matters so much DNA studies proving man and apes (and all other mammals) are related have come to light since this garbage came out in 1993 that Faid's bullbook is certainly good for laughs now. God knows it isn't good for anything else."
5,Wierd... but good...,This is another good one of Caroline Cooney's. It's a kind of a murder mystery with a love story twisted together. SCENARIO:Teenager Mary Lee gets sent off to a bording school with no clear reason why. She has always wished for Madrigal's (her sister's) life. She gets her wish... but she soon learns that you should be careful about what you wish for. ...This is a must-read- you won't be let down!
4,Twins by Caroline B Cooney,this is a vey inchanting book and it has lots of different twists and turns to the story line. with the two twins first living 17 years of there lives as one and getting separated at 17 by thier parents one moving to bording school and the other staying at highschool they turn out to be 2 completely different people with different personalities. one of the twins has it all popularity and personality yet the other is so plain and boring with no frinds at her bording school as she tells everyone that she has a twin sister yet no one believes (the popular twin) yet its only mary who than takes on the role her until she visits for a long weekend and then dies on a skiing trip but everyone thinks that it is madrigalof madrigal and lives a completely differnet life its all perfect when all of a sudden everythink goes wrong and mary is haunted by her false past living the life of madrigal.i really enjoned this book and recommend it for anybody that enjoys horror books.
1,Worst book I've ever read,"I really loved Caroline B. Cooney's other books, but this one was incredibly awful. The plot was totally implausible: if this girl was so close to her twin, how could she not know the truth about her? It's repetitive, going on and on about how much Mary Lee misses Madrigal, and Mary Lee's feelings about John Pear, Madrigal's boyfriend. And some of the lines are really overdone. For example: ""John Pear's laugh flipped in wild peals like a Frisbee."" I would definitely recommend reading the other books she's written, but not this one."
2,Doesn't Work,"We bought this to use for the sliding closet doors in our kids rooms. They don't work. The adhesive on the back doesn't stick well enough to make it work. If it stuck, the product would work (as long as the gap isn't too big between your doors). It was a good idea. I'm disappointed it didn't work."
1,Very disapointing,"At best this movie is predictable. The caracters are stereotyped and unidimentionnal, the actors are totally unconvincing perhaps because they are limited by the simplistic senario and possibbly because they are ''overdirected''. What you see in this movie you have seen before. The buildup of the relationship between the two lovers is shallow and weak and does not exactly sweep you off your feet. The obstacles prsented by the fact that they are from different cultural and/or racial backgrounds has been exploited much more brilliantly in numerous films some that date back a few decades like ''Guess who's coming to dinner?'' and more recently ''The Notebook'' Avoid this movie unless you are studying acting, directing or screenwriting and want to learn what not to do."
2,Couldn't get into it,"I chose this rating because i couldn't get into the book. it was boring, was difficult to read, and i ended up skimming it."
2,I have been taking this for years!!!,"I love the coral calcium I have been taking it for years, but this is the first time I bought it away from Bob's site. When I received my shipment from Phillips Natural Health I noticed that there were no exp. dates stamped on the bottom of these bottles. I called for an explanation, but have yet to hear back from these people. Now I am worried about the authenticity of the Bob's Barefoot Coral Calcium."
1,Disappointing,I bought these for my 2 year old daugter. I thought they would be a fun addition to bathtime. Instead they were a big disappointment. You can't color with them unless you press really hard. Then when you press hard they crumble and break apart. I remember having bathtime color crayons when I was a child and these were definatly not it. They were more of a hassle then fun.
3,OK but not worth the price,"It is good, but not as good as I would have expected. smells like artificial flavors. it does say artificial flavoring added."
2,"AM/PM Workout, not so good",I was disappointed in the length of each workout...Too long for me and Lee moves too fast in teaching the moves needed to benefit. More spirit is also needed.
5,TDD in FL,This program I saw on PBS by accident and it got me started buying Sarah Brightman's recordings. I have not been disappointed yet. An exellant buy for the price if you like Sarah.
5,Symphony Live in Vienna,"As expected Sarah Brightman is amazing, and always bring with hersuper stars like Alessandro Safina"
1,Sarah Brightman/Live in Vienna,"We were very disappointed in this DVD & CD, purchase Order #X0008EB20L. We thought we were ordering a Christmas DVD of Sarah Brightman in Vienna, but there were only about 4 -6 songs on the DVD, and they were not good quality. The CD did have a few Christmas songs on it, but it was damaged and not completely playable. We feel we did not get what we ordered, and would like to have our money refunded. We usually have no complaints about our orders with Amazon, but this was an exception.Please credit our Visa with $14.80. Sincerely, Priscilla Stratton"
4,"A Historically Informed ""What If"" Book for a Change","In contrast to many books in this genre that go off on wild tangents from small branches of history, this book features prominent historians considering what might really have happened ""if..."" One thing is clear: hindsight is not the 20/20 instrument that the cliche claims. There are areas of disagrement as the contributors approach the events from different points of view.A very interesting (and refreshing) conclusion of many of the essays is that not much would have changed. It is very difficult to alter the course of something as big as World War II. If one side or the other had been smarter or dumber at ""critical"" points, the war would have been shortened or lengthened by a few months or a year. Perhaps the post-war situation would have been a bit different. But very few choices would have resulted in an Axis victory--and in most of those the ""victory"" would have been a negotiated peace rather than a military triumph."
5,what if?,"An excellant and well thought out on the what if options that might have been during the second world war. This is real alternate history.I peticularly enjoyed the ones on Pearl Harbor.I suppose some of it might best be termed what if Hitler had not been Hitler, since it is most of his mistakes that lead to our current situation.I regret one of the what ifs not in this book is What If the Germans had not launched the Holocaust.But this is an excellant work none the less.Most enjoyable reading."
2,Egypt: Child Of Atlantis,"The book presents an interesting concept, one that does, and should, require some consideration. However, the book itself is difficult to follow, at times not cohesive. The final chapters made the most sense and followed a coherent outline and train of thought."
3,Good Product / Smelly hair,"I bought this curling iron because it was tourmaline and ceramic, and...all black to match all my other hair styling products.It's a good curling iron, it does what it is supposed to do. It heats up evenly and fast and curls perfectly everytime.The only complaint about this curling iron (which is why it only gets 3 stars) is that it leaves your hair smelling weird... I don't know what it is. The tourmaline, maybe it heats up to fast and is burned hair (but I don't think it's burned hair!). I usually have to rinse my hair as soon as the day is over so it doesn't leave a weird smell on my pillows when I sleep."
1,Broke after one use.,"The first time I used this product it was fabulous. My hair turned out beautifully. When I tried another day to get the same results, the curling iron wouldn't heat up."
5,Soul Cries - A Wonderful Journey,"To read the words of Lastmanout, is for me to look within my own Soul. When i read the musings of Lastmanout I feel he knows my Soul... it's joys, sadness, trials and tribulations. In a way, i feel i have been offered a guiding hand to understanding myself. In his most recent writing, Disturbance in the Force, of the tragic events of the attack on our country, he was able to put into words the vast emotions running through many of us and somehow brought me comfort knowing i am not alone. I would highly recommend his book Soul Cries to anyone interested in seeing our world and ourselves from a different perspective."
5,Author fights and wins against the Saudis,"Stupid lies versus raw facts, check this:http://counterterror.typepad.com/the_counterterrorism_blog/2005/05/no_solace_likel.html"
5,An excellent book!,"Scorpion's Sting combines elements of clever detective work, compelling personal narrative, and Southwestern life and politics to create an intreguing tale that any reader will love. When McKenzie's unlikely hero, Hal Taylor, adds part-time detective work to his credentials as a high school history teacher and father, he quickly finds himself involved in one of the biggest cases in Arizona history. McKenzie adds vibrant character depth to an excellently developed story, and the result is a terrific novel."
4,Chet Baker with NDR Big Band,"I think that at the end of his career, Chet Baker played with such distilled economy and sparseness, that for me there was almost a spititual, silent stillness that seemed to imbue the music he played. I think its true even of his vocals. Its a quality I particularly love about the music he created at that time. Was hoping Legacy 1 had this quality at the center of it. It does - on the very last cut of this album: All Blues. And I prefer Mr. Baker's version of this tune to even Miles Davis on Kind of blue. Chet Baker and the NDR Big Band play wonderfully together, and most of the rest of this album swings. It a bit busy, musically, for me. Wish there were more of the quiet, intimate, subtlety of All Blues. I think Chet Baker was at his best with small combos, for example Embraceable You, in which his trumpet and vocals are accompanied by simply guitar and bass. If you like big band and, of course, Chet Baker, I think you'll enjoy this album."
1,Vanessa Egyptian Cotton,"Extremely poor quality. With first washing, color faded, quality of Sateen finish was gone. Poor sewing quality too. I took them off my bed within 3 days. I wasted my money on these."
1,Shoddy Research,"I was dissapointed by this book---a few of the research subjects were previously familiar to me but when I reread them in this book I found the author had clearly performed only a perfunctory search into the topic missing many of the tie-ins, connections, players, and so-on. The treatment is very superficial and leaves you know more satisfied then reading an article in the newspaper on many topics. I would not waste your time on this book, there are plenty of better ones on this subject."
3,Love the product but..,"I love the product, I bought both this size and the dinner plate size, but it's very hard to get the stickers off. I had to take them off every plate (I ordered 24 of each size) and they wouldn't come off all the way, so it makes it look like the plate is dirty, which isn't good for what I intended them for; having company. I'm sure eventually they'll come off but it was just kind of a pet peeve."
3,A guy who needed this,My girlfriend but this for us and it's been fun to do something like this together. I was thinking it might have been too feminine until I tried it but it sure helped me get the knots out of my shoulders. Very easy
4,A very nice coffeetable book to describe Aikido and O Sensei,"The book is basically a big collection of photos taken by Walther V. Krenner with John Stevens' ""Art of Peace"" included at the end.Unlike other collection of photos of O Sensei, these are connected and are telling a story. Kinda like 'A day in the life of O sensei'.The only thing I didn't like about it was John Stevens' way of describing O Sensei though Indian mysticism and Yoga.I regard it as a very nice coffee table book and a very nice way to describe Aikido and O sensei to people."
5,"Excellent, Well Researched","This is a very captivating book that was well researched. It introduced thought provoking questions as well as reveiling facts about organizations that people today beleive as being just good but are really evil. You don't find many books that give the Gospel of Jesus Christ like this one, most christian books give you just a watered down version or none at all. Very well written. With the guidence of the Holy Spirit and the scriture verses to go back to and compare, you are able to come to the same conclusions as Matthew did also with the guide of the Holy Spirit. Well done, easy to read and picture from the begining to the end. Can't wait to the next one in the series comes out."
2,Needs improvement,"We received this as a Christmas present and my son was thrilled! After the 30 minutes it took to get it out of the box and put the batteries in he was having fun making the robot dance.But, it only took one transformation into car mode to dash the fun. After transforuming into the car it simply made a clicking noise as if a gear was stuck. It wouldn't do anything else. Since then, I have read other reviews at other sites and it seems that there are many people returning this product for the exact same reason.We are very disappointed because it is a very cool idea. After reading other reviews I think we will pass on getting another one."
5,Wonderful romance novel...,"This book is a true romance book. Loved chandos. Trying to find more books like this.if you do not enjoy this book, then you are crazy. Five star quality."
5,Fun read,"I loved the hero in this one. I thought the book was a fun and fast read. I can't say I liked the heroine so much, but the hero was a strong, ruthless, mean, and at the same time a most intriguing guyHighly recommend!"
1,Not worth buying,Not sure why this is getting so many stars on this site there definitely need to be more thorough reviews. Do yourself a favor and see if you can make it through more than three episodes of this anime before considering purchasing. I had a hard time but forced myself through part one (with it on mute after a while) just to see if at any point it was worth it. This has some painfully repetitive points and episodes with no progress at all. Don't get this expecting any good action sequences or amazingly drawn anime.
3,Really nice,Great plant hangers at a super price but one arrived without screws. I will get them at hardware store but was disappointd.
4,Fits my needs,This was sturdier than I expected. I purchased it to hang a mexican star light that I purchased in Cabo recently. I am hanging it inside so I probably could have gone with something flimsier. Mine came with the screws for the walls and it works just fine.
3,Easy and Nice,This is good but was really hoping for more of Glen music as it is his vocal and spirit that makes the prior albums of this nature. Still nice background worship album.
3,"Interesting, But Lacked Something","Though reading about Brooke's psychosis was interesting, the chapters towards the end of the book seemed to be lacking something. This may be from her being on antipsychotics or it may have been something else, but towards the end of the book, the book got less interesting than it had been at the beginning. If you have psychosis, you might want to check this out, though it might be a bit triggering for self-injurers as there are some descriptions of how she cut herself."
1,Poor translation.,"This review is directed towards this, apparently anonymous, translation. It is written in ""poetry,"" so that every two lines rhyme, but it is almost impossible to make sense of because of the archaic sentence structure. I am a Latin major who has read most of the Aeneid in Latin. In my opinion, it will be easier for potential buyers to learn Latin than to read this particular translation."
5,Excellent breakfast cereal,"It is a bit pricey but certainly worth it. I like the fact that there are no rock hard raisins in it requiring a 30 minute soak in milk to be able to eat it. It is very tasty, not too sweet, and just a great blend of ingredients. Never see it in grocery store in my area."
3,"Author a fan, but not too accurate","Rich Cohen's heart is in the right place here, but he needs to get some facts straight, e.g., the band is J. Geils, not Jay Geils. I liked his previous effort, ""Cooler by the Lake"", but this needs some serious editing."
3,I doubt that this is actually leather,"I bought this product for the cost and to prevent the accidental crushing of a couple of cigars when I'm away from the house. For these purposes, it serves me well. However, I must note that I do not believe that it is made from leather. It does not smell, look or feel like leather. It behaves like rigid vinyl, and the material sticks to itself making it difficult to separate at times."
4,Made for a Purpose,"I love this book. I read it to my PreSchool Children's Church Class ages 3-5 and they were captivated by the story. The story had real life hard issues that kids are faced with with a happy ending. I wish the story would have brought the out the idea of ""Purpose"" clearer. There are questions in the back of the book that help."
4,Duets,"I had the chance to ""live "" with TATA during a percussion week, and it was a great moment in my musician life ! In this record, Anga meets Tata, it's the same school and it's a pleasure for our ears..."
4,Good Read (But written for a Woman),"I found the book ""Turning Pro"" to be a good read. When I purchased the book I thought it might be for both man and woman looking to get into the Adult Business, but upon the first couple of pages you will find that its mainly written for a woman. But that aside, its a great book. It never really gets too indepth on some subjects and that leaves you with questions. In the Chapter about STD's it has some really great info that in itself make this book worth reading. If your looking for a indepth book about the Adult Business then this is not your book, but if your looking for a book that covers a wide range of work that gives you a starting point on research and/or work this is a great book to read. I found it very informative."
4,Very Entertaing,"Thorn and Sugarman have been friends since childhood. In this adventure they are faced with a truly evil character named Butler Jack. Together they must stop him from completing his to-do list of evil deeds. Battling incompetence and deception from the people in charge, and challenged by the genius of Butler Jack, they make some startling discoveries which will drastically alter their perceptions of themselves. The premise is wildly improbable but there were wonderful little pockets of sparkling prose scattered throughout which surprised me in a book of this nature. It kept me interested to the end and wanting to get to know Thorn and Sugarman better in future books"
1,Buzz Cut,"The book jacket says that this is one of the best thrillers written by James W. Hall. If this is the best, then don't read any of them!"
5,Beautiful Durable Watch,"I bought this watch because I needed something durable and strong...and the reviews from other nurses helped out a lot too!The face is a deep azure with easy to read hands and hour markings. It's smaller than I expected, but I am used to my old watch.The fastener is a bit strange with several additional folding parts that I wasn't expecting, but it assures that you won't be losing this watch easily!The bezel *is* hard to turn, but I assume that this will loosen up with time and use.Overall a beautiful, durable watch that I'm very happy with."
5,Music,For all who enjoy listening to Al Bano and Romina Power. Been working on completing my collection of their wonderful work together.
2,"well, at least it wasn't as bad as Dragon in Fury starring Dragon Shek","Now I am not going to go over the story in detail becasue it is VERY boring. Like the recently released Chen Zhen story movie 'Dragon In Fury', this feels a lot like a TV show. Fortunately this movie at least has some decent kung fu.These are not 2 of the finer performances by Yuen Biao and Billy Chow but they do make for an enjoyable final fight. And also Chen Zhen was tough as a 13 year old!The version from Tai Seng has poor sound and picture quality. Tai Seng-you either need to put out good movies with good picture and sound or DON'T COME OUT WITH THEM AT ALL."
5,SUPERB!!!,"It covers all the info a car design entusiast would like to know and much more! Profesional comments, history, processes, skentching techniques...A must have for anyone who loves car design... Hey! you won't ""design cars like a pro"" just by reading this book, but it's a great guide!"
4,tip of the iceberg,"over all this is a good book for most people that do notknow to much about car design. I just wish that it would,have went into the drawing part more. like what type of pen,paper markers and what size the art work is ect."
3,Still carrying on!,"Marc Cary is always a great show. Although there are a few familiar tunes on this live recording, they well done with a bit of updating. If you are into Marc Cary you will enjoy this live recording."
5,Holy Land Video,"This excellent video comprehensively covers the predominant archeological sites throughout Israel, and even the ancient city of Petra of Jordan, while correctly focusing on Jerusalem. The quality of the pictures is excellent as is the commentary. We spent two weeks there in January and February, the highlight of our travels around the world. We took many pictures while there, but the video provided a much better display of our visit to show family and friends."
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"This is a very dry read. Given the Web's visual elements, it's surprising there weren't illustrations to demonstrate what the author is talking about.If you've got even a modicum of media-writing experience, this book is pointless. It'll probably sit on my bookshelf as a reference."
3,These guys rock!,Prozaq Nation is by far the best band in the region! Their talent is beyond words!This CD is definately worth your time & money...HI DOUG!
1,Run the other way!,"We purchased this product as a gift. We have never been able to get it to work. It does not recognize ink cartridges as installed when they are. The point of purchase (not Amazon) refuses to take it back because (on their recommendation) we removed the UPC code and sent it in for a mail-in rebate. Back to the point, this machine is utterly useless in the literal sense. It does not function at all, let alone ""multi-function."" If you do decide to buy this worthless item, be advised that the machine requires individual ink cartridges for black, cyan, magenta and yellow, and it will not print if even ONE of the cartridges is empty. Ah, yes. Very useful."
2,Don't expect a USB cable!,The previous reviewers complain about the lack of a USB cable included in the box. Printers are NOT SOLD with cables any more. Customers are expected to provide their own.
3,"Mushroom Kit Works, but...",I ordered the kit and followed the instructions provided in the kit. I thought they where a little strange and nothing grew after several weeks. I decided to try my own method and within two days something started growing. If i hadn't read up on mushroom growing from another source I wouldn't have been able to grow anything. Luckily I knew what I was doing and ignored the instructions.
3,attend not yet known on quality,I haven't had my son using the product long enough now to know if this product is working or not. That's why I gave it a mid rating
5,Stick with it!,"This was my last hope for my son before I turned to prescription drugs.... I stuck with it it for 2-3 months before seeing results and beleive me I wasn't hopeful, but it really did work. Even his teacher noticed the difference in his classroom behavior. We had tried numerous things in the past feingold, other supplements, etc. Nothing worked now we are on Attend and stay away from excessive sugars, caffiene (including chocolate) and foods that I have found give him reactions (including any artificial colors and preservatives)."
3,So far so good.,"My son (10) has ADHD inattentive. He is not hyperactive, but has a lot of trouble staying on task. We've tried some other things and so I thought we could give this a try. We are taking 1 in the AM and 1 in the afternoon.I am happy to report no adverse side affects besides getting him to swallow the thing:) His grades seem to be improving and I've noticed his attitude is slightly improved overall. He just seems in a better mood than before.I cannot say anything specific the pill has done so I'm trying it for another couple of months to see if the trend continues to improve."
5,Wonderful Product,"We purchased this first at a local store as an alternative to Concerta, which my child refused to take because of side effects. It made him feel flushed and affected his sleep and appetite. We happened upon this his senior year in high school, and he now swears by this stuff. Our only regret is that we did not find it earlier.I tried it myself one day when I was too tired to focus at my job as a bookkeeper and the difference was noticable. My son and I both take it for work now. I would highly recomend trying it."
5,Attend makes a huge difference,"I can always tell if we skip a day or two. My son and daughter both get moody and forgetful and highly distracted. If it is going to work you should be able to tell within a few days. It doesn't make the problem go away completely, because some if it has to be dealt with on a behavior level, but it does seem to calm things down a lot, and makes focusing possible instead of impossible."
2,Attend does not help.,This product initially helped my son but after some time it didn't seem to make a difference. We eventually had to try something else. I do not recommend this product as a main solution for serious attention problems.
1,didn't fit,Garmin carrying case did not fit the golflogix. It was way too small. Was a double whammy since the golflogix I purchased from Amazon was not in working condition either. Disappointing father's day.
5,excellent,"Garmin 200W. Used between South Carolina and in and around Washington, DC. Absolutely excellent - easy to use and uncanilly accurate!"
5,PERFECT for my Nuvi 760,"Great service from Amazon. The carrying case perfectly fits my nuvi 760. There is no flap to close the top, but I don't consider this a drawback as the case fits snugly and dirt can't slip around the edges. I couldn't be happier with the product, the order and ontime delivery."
4,"It's a case, but that's about it.","I purchased this case for the Garmin Nuvi 765T that I got over black friday. It's a good case, in the sense that it protects the overall product. However it isn't exactly what I imagined. The case is a bit tight for the 765T, and it's extremely hard to remove the GPS. It's very easy to accidentally turn the GPS on while taking it out (although PR will probably spin this off as a feature, ""Automatically turns your GPS on!"") I imagine that over time by taking this in and out, it'll loosen the grip a little bit, and make it a little easier to take out and put back in.It's simply a case for protection. As a case, it does it's job very well, but I would expect maybe a little more features. The little pocket in front can hold MAYBE an SD card, and there's no top loop that prevents the GPS from falling out. It would have been better if Garmin included this with the purchase of the GPS. Overall a decent purchase, but don't expect too much."
4,Nice Addition,"The leather carrying case for the garmin is a nice addition. When leaving the car, we usually take it with us and the case makes it much easier to carry."
4,A little tight,Nice case but it is a little tight at first for the 650 model....seems to stretch after a little while but it is difficult to get in and out at first
2,"it works, barely","Convenient slip case until the elastic bands began to lose strength, after about 20 uses, and my Garmin unit began to fly out the end whenever I picked it up wrong or when I was in a hurry. Slip case indeed. Consider a case with a more positive latching mechanism if you want to toss your Garmin in briefcases and luggage. If all you do is hide your gps in the glove box, then this slip case will be fine.You need some kind of case to protect the screen when not in use unless you want to leave it attached to your windshield. That'll work until someone smashes your windshield in order to steal the gps. It won't be long."
2,Be aware,"When Putting my garmin in case it is almost impossible not to turn the unit on, as the on/off switch is directly in line with the side of pouch ."
5,Great case,A must. We never leave it in the car because people in our area burgle them. With the case it can go into my wife's purse and not get scratched up.
4,Good protection,"This case is useful for protecting the screen of the GPS. It is a very snug fit, but is good for its purpose. Unless your screen is exactly 4.3"", go with a larger case."
4,Garmin Case,"The case was bought as a present for my husband as well, he doesn't use it much, but I got it just in case."
5,Does Just What I Want,The Garmin GPS does exactly what I want. It gets me there with a minimum of trouble. The blue tooth phone works great and the MP 3 is good also.
3,GOOD CASE FOR JUST THE GPS UNIT,"THIS CASE PROVIDES GOOD PROTECTION FOR THE NUVI UNIT BUT... DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF STORAGE FOR THE SUPPORT AND CABLE, NEXT TIME I WILL BUY A CAMERA CASE THAT HOLDS THE WHOLE WORKS"
1,THIS DOES NOT FIT THE 650!!!,"This was part of a ""special offer"" when I purchased my 650 -- ""include this carrying case for a few dollars more"" -- BE CAREFUL! The 650 will NOT fit into this case! I'm returning it, along with a nasty-gram to the marketing department!"
3,Leather Case for Garmin Nuvi,"The case was nice for the price. It is certainly nice to have something with which to transport the Garmin around. The only subtle problem is that it is such a snug fit that if you slide the Garmin in the wrong direction, it sometimes inadvertantly turns on."
3,Not a Garmin quality,"As stated in the headline, this item is below Garmin quality. I've received one as part of the 660 bundle, and after using it for a couple of months, the screen cracked because of the not-so-strong pressure in my gloves compartment, even though the device was in the case. Therefore, this cheap plastic couldn't protect my screen. Since my kids lost the case, I've bought the new one which is a little bit smaller, so it's not so easy to fit 660 in. Would by a hard case if I'd known there is one."
4,Just Basic,This is just a basic case that your Garmin fits in. Since the Garmin I purchased had a wider screen I didn't know what other cases might fit. The Garmin does fit well in the case so you can store.
1,Not compatable with Nuvi 855,"I ordered this product for use with my Nuvi 855, however this model hardly fits inside. Putting the GPS in isn't nearly as complicated as taking it out. The sides have little give so if your GPS is large enough for a snug, secure fit, it will likely be too large to easily remove. I have stretched mine out as much as possible to make it useable, but it is still a bit of a challenge to remove and I managed to accidentally tear a thread or two, so I'm not expecting this case to last me very long."
5,A Nice Leather Holster for my Garmin Nuvi 360,This leather holster was made to hold the Garmin Nuvi 360 navigational device. It protects it from dust and keeps the unit clean.
4,Great-fitting case,"I bought this to fit a Nuvi 760 and it fits perfectly. Not too loose, not too tight. It would be nice to have perhaps a little strap that snaps in place to ensure the GPS doesn't slip out but it's snug enough so that I'm not really that worried about it. Decent product and I'd recommend it for your GPS to help protect the screen."
5,Great product,"I bought a Nuvi 650 to replace my Nuvi 350, excellent price but it did not include the leather case. This is the genuine Garmin case, fits perfectly and protects the Nuvi screen from damage. There is another model with a flap, but I had this type for my Nuvi 350 and it was more than adequate."
4,A good one,"Now this is one snugly fitting carrying case. I bought it for my 265T.It protects the GPS very well but is a little clumsy to handle.Pros are-Protects the screen from scratchesIt fits nicely, accidentally drop the case and the GPS is protected.The feel and finish is fairly good.Cons-One side open....could use a zipper or somethingThere's no clip or strap to carry it(u have to put it in your pocket or bag)"
3,not a clear picture,"would have liked an enclosed case with a zipper going around it. the picture was hard to tell for sure. also when you put in the unit, the switch will sometimes turn on because the fit is tight."
4,Garmin Carrying case,"A nice and simply carrying case. Although it is open at one end, it is tight enough to hold the piece securely."
1,DOES NOT FIT,THE 660 GPS WOULD NOT FIT IN CASE. VERY CHEAP CASE FOR THAT PRICE.I WOULD SEND IT BACK BUT I HAD TO OPEN IT TO FIND OUT IT DIDN'T FIT.NO RETURNS IF YOU OPEN IT.BE CAREFUL ABOUT THIS ONE.
2,Garmin 010-10823-01 Case for Nuvi 650,I would not recommend this one;go for the case logic hard case it's a little bigger and better.
2,not happy in Boston,"I just received the Garmin 010-10823-01 case for my Garmin 200.Its too large so it sticks out about one inch. I would return it but, once you open the package wrap you have to pay 30% restocking charge plus shipping back and insurance the dam thing cost $12.99 pls 2.00 shipping so to send it back it will cost me about $7.00 not worth it. In Boston is a electronics store that carries everyting I wish I went their first. No happy in Boston"
3,Not so perfect for my intended purpose,"I am using this Garmin 4.3 case with a nuvi 1390. I just needed a case to protect the screen and finish of the GPS itself when stowing it in the glove box, carrying in a purse or with cell phone and keys in hand. If you, like me, leave the rest of the power cable and mounting base in the glove box then it is perfect.7/26/10 - I did what I shouldn't have, walked out of the car with the GPS in the case while carrying other things at the same time. The GPS slid out of the case and landed on the street. The device while still functional suffered scratches. This is certainly not the case to use if you intend to take the GPS out of the car.I have lowered the score to three given the lack of usability and availability of better alternatives at the price point."
4,Nice but dont really use it,"It's a nice cover but I dont take the garmin out of the car. This is more for ppl that want to throw it in their purse/bag. The usb port is in the back of the item so u have to unplug it to use it. If the port was on the side I could leave it plugged in ,slip it in the case then hide it in my glove compartment, etc. It was still worth the $10 as opposed to $20 that Target sells it for."
2,Tighten Up!,"I was so happy with my new Garmin GPS and wanted to protect it while carrying in my handbag between journeys. This case -- with Garmin printed on the side -- was not produced well. It slips right off the GPS. Now my screen has a deep scratch. I am VERY unhappy about this. Why didn't they just make it a more snug fit? Like put stretchy sides on? Overall, the size is good, slides right in no problem... only it also slides right out again: BIG PROBLEM if it's in your handbag with keys, and other bits which will easily scratch your precious GPS screen. I am very disappointed and have to now buy another case. in the meanwhile I am securing this with a rubberband. Not what I wanted."
3,too skimpy,"these are great original recordings, but ""20 Greatest Hits"" on the Capitol/EMI label is a much better value...anyone who ever wanted to purchase a Merle Haggard CD will probably not be satisfied with this"
2,Seam sealant to manually apply after purchase!!,"Be careful when buying this item, the bad surprise comes after reading the instructions: you have to apply a seam sealant if you do not want to camp in a sub-marine! This tent is priced at $200 and yet you have to apply a seam sealant and let it dry for 24 hours after application! The other tent I have from Kelty is cheaper and the sealant was pre-applied in factory. I have never been impressed by Coleman products, this will be my last one."
1,Wrong discriprion,"Waste of money they don't fit on my imapala 96 LT1 engine,When I placed my order I did checked the cometibility which showed forImpala ss 96 LT1.Since I got them they are still useless for me and still in the box.Please be honest."
2,Video Content,Should have read the description more clearly. Thought this was with old Johnny Carson shows not a documentary of who Johnny was by various entertainers.
3,A Great Unrealistic Story,"Sparrow Hawk Red is a good book. It is about a foolishly brave boy. I liked his adventures but they're unrealistic. I liked the very end because it was very exciting and suspensefuul. I liked the part when Ricky poisons the guards. That was the best part except for the last few sentences of the book. I really like the story, even if it's unrealistic."
4,Great Buy!,"My boyfriend and I have both used this product and enjoy it. I'm female and 5'4"" with a medium frame (31"" where strap is worn: over-heart/under-chest). I use the strap on the tightest setting and feel that it fits snuggly.The watch is WAY too big and bulky, but I don't need to wear it anyway. (I strap it to the elliptical - so I can cover the elliptical display with a book and still be able to glance down at my heart rate.) The elliptical at the gym picks up the reading from the strap great, so the watch isn't necessary.The boyfriend wets the strap before use. I don't. We both get good results.I had hoped that there would be a touch option on the watch to get a heart rate reading without the strap, but for the price it's fine without it.The desire for a watch that fits and a touch heart rate option are the primary reasons I would purchase a different product if I were buying again."
4,Heart Rate Monitor,"Great product. Works as advertised, nice side effect was that the chest strap also transmitted to the treadmills I use at my gym."
4,Cheap basic HR monitor,"I am no ""techie"" but I did succeed in getting this monitor to work for me with very little fiddling (although I did not set the alarms - I just want to know my heart rate). I am a small boned female and wish the watch strap had more adjustments. I also wish the chest strap were smaller. But all told, I have adjusted the strap and let the excess hang in the back. I have worn the monitor to the health club and the machines read it and display my HR on their display, so I really do not need the watch with me.( I get a more continuous reading than if I use the grips on the machines and wait for a response). The monitor seems to be accurate when compared to other results I get. I cannot say how long the battery will work as I have only had the product for a month.I recommend this HR monitor if you want a cheap basic HR monitor. A small female might want to look into a women sized product."
5,easy to use and accurate,"This heart rate monitor is just as it is supposed to be: easy to use and very accurate.I had lots of problems with other heart rate monitors. The display would fluctuate like hell. could be due to my untrained heart, strange rhythm or the somewhat unique shape of my chest.No problem with this one, at all."
1,Broke after 1 day,"Can't recommend it. Just like other reviewers, the battery was dead after a day. After replacing battery, the item still never worked right.Ended up throwing away since I was past my return date for Amazon (I didn't open it for a while after getting it)"
1,Don't waste your money,I am very disappointed in the Omron HR-100C HRM; it lasted only two weeks and 8 workouts! and the monitor has stopped displaying my HR.
4,heart monitor,"This is a basic monitor , which is all I want. It works. Jack fifteeen, sixteen, seventeen, eiththeen , ninteen, twenty.."
4,Works Fine,"The heart rate monitor works well. The set-up was a little tedious, especially with instruction booklet that has tiny print."
4,omronHR100C,"Good monitor for my needs. Samefrequency as Polar but significantlycheaper. Ability to replace batteryis a big plus. Saves wait, replacementand shipping costs.Still new, so long term experience notdetermined. I'm hoping for the best."
1,Absolutely unreliable,"This meter worked for a week after it arrived. Now it rarely works. Water is always required, but sometimes even with lots of water there is no reading. Trying to use the meter to take a resting pulse before getting up in the morning is impossible for a couple reasons. Not only does Rega have to keep water near the bed, but also by the time, she has made several attempts adding more water each time, the pulse has gone up.Contacting Omron during the warranty period, she was told that(1) we would have to pay to return the item.(2) Manufacturer might decide that the product was in perfect condition.(3) We would have to reimburse Omron for its shipping costs if it elected to replace the item.Condition (3) was revealed only after her third call to Omron. It prompted us to return the item instead to Amazon."
5,used for exercise,Purchased after recent heart attack. Used during aerobic exercising and kept me on track within the limits set by my doctor. Currently in need of batteries!
4,A Cheap and Good Choice,"This heart rate monitor is a very basic unit. It works, most of the time, for what it says it will do. There are some drawbacks. There is no feature to estimate calories burned which is only a guess but a nice feature. There is a back-light on the watch which is nice if you wear this as a watch also, which I do. It has a stopwatch, an alarm clock and you can adjust the watch to international time (military time) or regular American time. It also does a good job keeping track of the date. My biggest pet peeve with this unit is that if you so much as bump a wall with it, it scratches the paint right onto it and it doesn't want to come off. Other than that, this unit is great but be aware of what your getting yourself into."
2,unreliable,"had I reviewed this after the first time I used it, I would've given it glowing marks, but it has not read my heart rate correctly since the first time I used it. I'm using it for interval training, and I haven't seen it budge when my heart rate is noticeably higher (after a sprint, etc). I guess that's why it was only $35...should've splurged for the $100 Nike. My sister hasn't had a problem with hers. What a bummer."
3,doesn't work with every person,"I got this heart rate monitor (my first) just to see what my pulse was while using my elliptical trainer. As a novice, I thought the watch had a sensor in addition or instead of the chest strap. Not true, guess I just have to use the sweaty chest strap. I also was not aware that you have to set ""target zones"" that are for people training in a specific heart rate range, so that function really only works for training in one zone. I wanted to use it for meditation and with my biofeedback unit in addition to cardio excercise, but I would need a seperate monitor or else reprogram it everyday.But the real kicker-it works well on me but does not pick up a reading on my husband-and I am pretty sure he is alive."
4,Works well,"It does what it's suppose to. Sometimes it doesn't get your heart beat, I need to take it off and put it back and it works.cons : I haven't test it a lot while running, but the strap that you put around the chest has to be tight it you want it to stay"
1,does not measure up to other heart monitors,I am a long-time user of heart monitors. When I lost the receiver part of my current monitor a cardio sport-- I bought this Omron. I had been very happy with other omron products. They have the best pedometer and an excellent blood pressure monitor. I bought the Omron because the price was low for what i THOUGHT WAS A HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT. i RETURNED THE FIRST ONE BECAUSE IT DIDN'T PICK UP THE HEART RATE EVEN WHEN IT WAS VERY CLOSE TO THE BELT. i GOT A SECOND ONE AND THOUGH A BIT BETTER IT DID NOT PICK UP THE HEART RATE WHEN i WAS MORE THAN A FOOT AWAY. This performance is very disappointing. The second one will also be returned and I will buy an inexpensive Polar without all the bells and whistles but one I can rely on.
1,Impossible to set,"I have spent two hours trying to program this heart monitor according to the directions. I have finally concluded that the machine is defective rather than the instructions being unintelligible (which they almost are). It may be that I am simply unable to intuit the correct procedure. I ordered this monitor because I have been very happy with their blood pressure monitor and the pedometer, but this is ridiculous! I definitely would not recommend it."
4,Understanding my heart rate,"I bought this device to help me understand/measure when my heart rate is in the ""fat burning"" aerobic zone and then maintaining it there for 10 to 20 minutes. This is quite important to those of us who want to gain significantly from exercise while also losing weight. This device is very popular with joggers and runners but that is never going to happen for me. I found the Omron Heart Rate monitor very low priced and easy to use. I also bought it because Omron is an exceptional manufacturer of medical equipments and it was recommended by my trainer and my chiropractor.I am quite happy with my purchase."
4,Simple to use and EZ to read,"The heart rate monitor was EZ to set up, EZ to use and has big numbers, so it's EZ to read for me. The chest band if very comfortable. The only improvement I would suggest would be to change the material of the wrist band. It's a little to rigid for me and I sweet too much underneath it.Otherwise, it's great to have something as simple as this when I work out to monitor my heart rate. Good investment !"
3,erratic,"Positives:easily readable, easy to use and set up, waterproofNegatives:Reads erratically. Heart rate bounces from 40 to 180 within a few seconds.I sent it back a few days ago after calling their service dept. I'll wait and see what happens."
1,Works intermitently,"This is my second HR-100C.First one I bought was 3 yrs back,it was pretty good deal and made use of it very well,it died after discontinuing to use for a year.So,I decided to buy another one.But this one works intermittently.I am too lazy to return it.I am surprised and not-satisfied."
4,Heart Rate Monitor - Omron,"Product is exactly what I wanted, basically a heart rate monitor. Numerals are large. Simple set up. It arrived with one defect, the backlight does not work. The price is right compared to Polar."
4,Good Basic Watch,"It is a good basic watch. It is easy to read and has a backlight. The first one sent to me had a dead battery, but they sent a new one quickly."
3,"Went bad after a year, new one is acting funny",I bought my first monitor last year and it worked great. I have a heart condition and I've been strapped with 24 hour holsters before and the monitor was pretty close. It went bad all of a sudden last month and I thought it was the battery. So I paid $17 to have the watch portion's battery changed (the whole unit cost me $35 last year) and changed the strap's battery. It didn't help. So I bought a new one. Heck they are only $35. But that one seems to be working weird. It takes a long time to pick up the signal. I'll keep an eye on it but I'm still bummed that I had to spend $17 and then $35 to get one working. I guess you get what you paid for.
5,OMRON HR-100C HEART RATE MONITOR,"This is my second purchase of this model. It works well. The last set failed, by separating in the plastic chest band. The plastic watch strap failed one week later. They both operated properly for about three years, with moderate to hard daily use. I replaced the watch wrist band. I am now using it with the new chest strap. The transmitted signal can also be picked up by some exercise equipment's digital display. It is easy to use, and the chest band is comfortable."
4,Good product,It has worked well for me - no problems at all. This is a necessity if you do aerobic exercise.
3,"Worked for 20 months, then I went swimming....","I was really happy with the HR-100C, especially for the price. I even bought one for a friend. I work out every day, weights, running, bike, eliptical. I was thrilled with it until I needed to change the battery. It seemed to be more involved than I wanted to get into--it wasn't clear to me how to extract the battery after I opened the back. I took it to a jeweler and it worked fine for several months after he changed the battery, but I just wore it snorkeling and it leaked. I didn't snorkel for more than 10 minutes with it on, or dive below 3 feet. It's still working a few hours later, but I doubt it will survive the salt water dunk, and I can't see the time, anyway, because the crystal is so fogged up. So much for waterproof. I guess for $30 bucks I can just buy a new one every time the battery dies so I don't have to worry."
1,Throw this one ion the garbage,I have been a POLAR user for 10 years in spinning classes. I'm very familiar with the operation of the unit. This Omron system isn't worth the cost of return postage. It is garbage. The pulse reading stays constant no matter how much I exercise. It is simply not accurate. I have A-fibb which makes my heart go up and down like a yo-yo with other pulse meters so wide fluctuation in pulse is normal for me. Get a POLAR! They are worth the extra money believe me.
1,You get what you pay for,"The watch doesn't read a signal at arms length. I put the chest strap on before driving to the gym and periodically checked my HR. As I was driving and had my hand on the steering wheel at arms length, the watch wouldn't read. Only when I bring the watch a few inches closer will it work. Watch isn't nearly as water resistant. Mine got some water due to humidity in the dry sauna and it broke.Product is cheap. Don't buy if you need quality. Value is subpar, but it works only under certain conditions."
4,Very nice . . .,"After about five years of regular use my Polar heart rate monitor gave out. I don't need anything fancy so I decided to go with the Omron after reading the many positive reviews. I'm glad I did and, honestly, it's a better device than my old Polar in just about every way. It's easy to set the time and heart rate parameters. It has a stopwatch feature and the battery in the chest strap is replaceable (not a feature of the Polar as the photo above indicates). Plus, it's just more stylish and makes for a nice general use digital watch. I have one small reservation: the unit does not record average heart rate over the course of a workout. This is a nice feature of more expensive units but not essential. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase."
1,Garbage,"This monitor is packaged nicely and the chest strap is decent, but the accolades end there. Upon first use, the digital readout on the watch was not showing completely (some of the digital lines that make up the numbers are too faint to see; e.g., 1 and 7 look exactly the same). After about a week of use, the watch starts beeping uncontrollably sitting on the table and won't respond to pushing any of the buttons. I expected the limited functionality at this price but not complete dysfunctionality!Omron Customer Service is only open during business hours and it is not worth the hassle of returning such a cheap piece of garbage. Lesson Learned.Bottom Line: Buy a different and spend the extra $20 for something a little better."
4,"Acurate, Durable, and Affordable","You know I was pretty surprised how well it worked. I pretty much took a leap of faith due to the fact that I am on a budget (trying to get ready for the fire academy, wish me luck!)What comes with your purchase is a heart monitor strap that goes around your chest. You do feel it, but when your running and in the zone, it doesn't really bother you. A watch that teleports the heart rate from the heart monitor strap to the watch. You also get a rubber mound on which you can place your watch on an exercise machine, and a convenient pouch to store everything.What I also like about it is that I can just put on just the chest strap, and it would transmit my heart rate onto a treadmill or an oplitical machine without the watch.Overall I am happy. I wanted to go with Polar, but you get all this for a fraction. And it really works. Overall, I would recommend this to my friends and other gym ""rats""."
4,A Simplistic HR monitor,"Like most reviews, you get what you pay for with this HR Monitor. Going from timex(which included features such as avg./max/minimum HR and a couple other features) to the Omron's simplistic display of just your heart rate wasn't to big a deal. To be honest, the only feature that I missed upon first purchase was the average HR within an elapsed time, but that can be made up for if using the ""zone"" features on this model to keep you within a desired average during a workout.The most helpful pro of the Omron is that it's more accurate than my previous and more pricey Timex models. In my opinion, if you're looking for a HR monitor, you want it to be accurate and without fluctuating readings in the middle of workouts.A big con is that the watch doesn't include ""timing split"" feature, just a ""start/stop"" and ""erase"" of your workout time.Overall, it serves the most primary purpose of being a heart rate monitor, and that's displaying an accurate heart rate consistently."
2,"poor transmission, small digits","I found it impossible to get a reliable signal from the beltto the monitor. Despite belt adjustments and wetting the padsdata was intermitant, with zero being the most frequent reading.Also the display digits were small and I found them hard todiscern while exercizing."
1,Worked for 2 workouts,Maybe I got a bad one? This worked for a couple of workouts so I threw out the box. Then it stopped working so I got a new battery...it made no difference. Then I bought the electrode lube and it only worked for one more workout. I got this on a recommendation but I'm extremely dissappointed and now I'm out all that money. I'm looking into consumer reports for a recommendation on a new one.
3,"Does what its supposed to do, interference sucks","Why pay $50, $60 or over $100 dollars for a heart rate monitor? I have to say most of the extra features on more expensive models such as "" fat loss calculator "" are inaccurate and use very outdated formulas that are laughable and flat out inaccurate, Knowing these facts I decided I would go for a model that just measures my heart rate, that's all I need and for some reason I had a hard time finding just that until I ran into the Omron HR-100C.I don't usually go to the gym when its crowded, so I had no problems with electronic interference , but I can notice that when someone happens to jump on the cycle or treadmill next to me, his machine is reading my heart rate too, I'm sure if someone wearing another heart rate monitor comes next to me I wouldn't like this model so much. I guess I just have to keep reminding myself "" hey its less than $40 ;-)"""
1,wouldn't do that again,This product doesn't really do what it is supposed to do. Half the time it couldn't pick up a reading and when it did was grossly inaccurate. I don't really see the point of selling a product that doesn't at all do what it is intended to do.
4,Didn't work,"I tried several different positions, my sister did, and my father did. It didn't work for any of us. Changed the battery just in case; still no dice. 2 stars because the watch is at least decent.EDIT: Returned old one, got a new one quickly, and it works now... My luck I'd get a defective unit first try. Four stars since I had to go through the process of returning..., but other than that this new one works fine so far."
4,Happy with purchase,Item functions well and is easy to program & read. Only disappointment is the wrist band is a little large for a petite person.
2,Inconsistent,"Worked OK at first, then would give inconsistent readings. Heart rate would freeze and then jump wildly up or down. This would be OK if it happened once in awhile, but it happen so often that I could not rely on the rate having any degree of accuracy. I replaced both batteries to make sure the problem was not related to a weak signal. I also made sure that the watch and transmitter were well within the specified distance range. I also made sure the connection was not dry at the start, and even after an hour of heavy perspiration the reading was not consistent, so it was not a conductivity issue between the transmitter and skin. I returned the unit."
1,DOA and Omron is no help,"Don't bother with this unit, apparently many are being shipped out with dead batteries and Omron is absolutely no help. They actually told me that if I sent it in for diagnosis they would charge me to replace the battery if it needed replacement. So, back to Amazon it goes."
2,"Works well, but poorly made","I only wanted a basic HR monitor, since the fancier ones can be quite expensive, and reviews directed me towards the Omron as a no frills but solidly made product.I agree on the no frills part, and it certainly worked well for the 2 months that I've had it. The downfall of this is the plastic strap part (made of some sort of rubberized plastic) that connects to the sensor module. After two months of normal use, one side of the strap (the rubber part) broke off, leaving it quite useless. Hopefully I can repair it, but for $50 I was expecting it to last a little longer.Maybe Omron can replace the joint with a metal pin instead of just having rubber."
5,Read this review,"I purchased this product for one reason only.. That is... to avoid passing out during an extreme workout. My zone (bpm) is from 166-177 bpm, I normally go pass that and go up to 210bpm which could result to heart failure. I don't have time to stop and count my pulse the old fashion way just to get a reading, thanks to this product I could finally stay in my zone and burn fat effectively.Price is very reasonable. The strap might be a lil too big for those of you who are skinny, petite or slimmer than 130 lb, 5 foot guy.Other than that, I highly recommend this especially for those of you who are doing P90X!!!"
1,Didn't Work ... Don't waste your time ... Buy a different brand,"I read the enclosed product booklet that came w/ the Omron heart monitor and I followed all of the set-up instrucions, but the heart monitor just didn't do anything. It registered the time, but it never displayed anything else durring my treadmill workout. I pressed the correct button, the correct number of times and ... no change. I don't need another watch, I need a heart monitor."
4,Works for what I need it,"I use this heart rate monitor for working out. The strap is comfortable and seems durable. The treadmill tries to pick up the signal, but it sometimes gives a different reading from the wrist watch, so I always use the latter. I wish the wrist watch were smaller, sleeker, and more stylish, but it serves its purpose."
1,Did not work at all - Please read...,"The wrist unit worked fine. So I strapped the chest unit on, and .... nothing. The wrist unit simply was not picking up anything from the chest unit, or the chest unit wasnt working. It might be due to my chest hair. Who knows?"
5,great gift purchase,This was a great gift at a low cost. Omron is a great name that stands behind their product. Nice looking and easy to use.
5,Works as advertised.,"Works as advertised, accurate when compared to pulse. I use it at night, so I was confused at first. When you turn on the light, it freezes the heart rate and beat indicator, so for a while I thought it was busted until I checked under a street light."
4,Good Value but not Perfect,"It is a great value if you only looking for the heart rate, time and a few functions. Compare to my other similar product, Sportline 1060, the display is smaller and difficult to read in weak lighting conditions but much easy to set up and cost about half for me. The heart rate reading is comparable."
4,Fun chasing bad guys,"I wish this had unique in-car views to give each car a flavor beyond the performance. Also, an option for realistic damage modeling would be nice. The physics need some work. Overall, though, a beautiful simulation. Fun!"
2,Not upto standard,I have played the Need for speed games both on Pc and on playstation and really enjoyed Need for speed 4.But NFS 5 wasnt as eays to control or as fun to play.Only Porshes being available was a drawback and the gameplay was boring.I would recomend F1 2oo1 or Nfs 4 high stakes.
1,DISCO PARA COMUNISTAS - DISKUS FOR THE COMMUNISTS,"Todo aquel o aquella q' compre este disco apoya al Tirano De Cuba; Al Caligula De America - Phidel Kastro. Yo soy D-E-M-O-C-R-A-T-I-C-O y me opongo a que bendan estos discos en los estados unidos de la america ya que aqui tenemos los dolares y ellos pesos devaluados que no sirven para nada. grabacion de un concierto en Cuba esclavizada para la Radio-TV cubana que destruyo a la perla del caribe. No lo compren!!!INGLISHNo bye this record becuase it is communist record and against God! Phidel kastro is communist and a bad man and this is why the cuba is eslave contry and piero y pablo milanes they love castro but sell their protest musiq for dollars that the people of cuba no have and they have no freedom and one day el tirano will die and then this record will be communist again, so dont bye it plis. I am democratical, I love america plis americans dont bye this thank you"
5,Amazingly Comprehensive,"Everyone knows Angel didn't hit its creative stride until season three (enter Amy Acker, rev up the Cordy/Angel romantic subplot, and begin the engaging multi episode baby arc), but this book does a great job of detailing the first two seasons. Get it. Great pictures, tons of facts. A must have for any Angel fan."
2,broke in less than a few hours,"I am a Family Therapist who works with a lot of kids and teens, I thought this would be fun to have in my office. It didn't get past me and my fiance playing with it on Christmas day. Two pieces broke in the first 24 hrs. we are thirty years old, how can this stand the test of kids or teens??? I am really disappointed because it is such a cool toy and very creative."
2,a real life nightmare !!!!!!!!!!!!!,THE BOOK WAS HORRIBLE AND I BROUGHT IT FOR A FRIEND . SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW THIS MADE ME LOOK WHEN I TOOK IT OUT OF THIS NICE BROWN PACKING. THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN IN AND HIGHLIGHTED EVERY WERE I WANTED TO SENT IT BACK BUT MY FRIEND REALLY NEEDED IT . THE WORSE WAS THAT IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE IT GOOD CONDITION .. JUST KEEP IT REAL ...
4,nice even bake,"These pans bake even , but I had to use parchment paper or butter and flour the pans. But I love these pans. Cleaning them is easy. Buy em, you will luv em!"
5,cake pans,arrive on time and in new condition . i just used them again reminding me how easy the cake layers come out and how simple to clean.
2,Camera Management is the design center,"I bought Medieval and played Shogun's demo, and got the same strong impression: the game is too reliant on control of the camera as the action is too fast to both get the right perspective and issue orders. I played 4 scenarios and uninstalled it as I wanted to think about command troops in the field, not fly some camera about a battle.While there is clearly some value here that is not found elsewhere (I'm sure you'll find it in the positive reviews), I found better choices for the thrill of real time grand tactical sim in the Myth series (particularly The Fallen Lords... fewer units used to accomplish the same depth of tactical richness, combined with better camera interface) and in Sid Meier's Gettysburg! and SM's Antietam!Have fun whichever you choose.tone"
3,"Great quality, nice noise reduction, hurts my ears","I bought these headphones hoping for a comfortable listening and gaming experience... I wasn't entirely dissappointed. The bass is true and clear as is the higher tones. However, after using it for a few months, the padding really starts to deteriorate. It gets to the point that after listening for about a half hour, my ears start to hurt. I have to take them off for about five minutes so that they don't go numb, and NO I don't have the volume on absolute max ;)Overall a good set of headphones, but a bit overpriced for the discomfort."
2,Not the noise reduction you are looking for,"These headphones were a bad decision on my part. They advertise Noise Reduction, but I think the NR creates more noise than it attenuates. If there is any breeze or wind, you get this maddening low frequency sound. If there is no breeze or wind, the music is louder but I didn't notice any active noise reduction. With the noise reduction turned off, the headphones are decent, but a bit boomy for my tastes."
1,5 Stars? I think not!,"There are very few books that deserve 5 stars because that implies that the book is perfect and can not be improved upon. Conversely there are few books that warrant 1 star because that implies that the book has no redeeming value. However in light of the overwhelmingly excessive perfect reviews this book received, for balance I will only give it one star. Let's face it: Baby Momma Drama isn't exactly intellectual stimulation. You're not going to become enlightened and it's hardly thought provoking. It's not going to stand besides the works of Morrison, Joyce, Orwell, and Baldwin as a literary masterpiece. In essence it's a light, fluffy, readable book that can be enjoyed for it's rapid pace and ever popular (if somewhat overdone) subject matter."
4,this book was the bomb,"this book was the bomb it was tru in many ways but it made me mad in many ways like why did jazz take so much flat out b.s from dude and i would not have watch that ... wendy child but hey maybe she was blinded by as her sister put it his ""johnson"" or whatever i just hope theres a second baby momma drama cause if you think about it there would be so much more drama to come from the choices that was made in the first like if wendy or derrick got out and went after jazz or malik came back droped the hoe and got back with steph or tried to or maybe travis came back or whayever but kudos to carl for a great book really want it to be a second"
4,Suprising hit!!,"When I picked up this book, I had never read anything by Carl Weber. The beginning started a little slow but one I got going, I couldn't put it down. Following the 2 main characters was like listening to stories from my homegirls. I read this one in about 2 days ---work got in the way---. Definite page turner."
4,Hott and Steamy,This book is really good. I like Carl Weber and his stories. The sisters Jasmine and Stephanie are different in their own way but find out that they reallly need each other. I'm happy that the ending wasn't some fairy tale ending and he kind of switched it up. It was a really page turning. I reconmend the book.
3,not 2 much moma drama,"The book was alright. I exspected much more baby moma drama than what the book had ,frankly i'm wondering why he gave that tittle. Carl should've named the book something else,cause with the drama i was disapointed. None the less he had me turning the pages."
3,Funny and Pathetic All In One,"Well I realize this review is 5 or more years after this book was written. To be honest, I generally avoid books in this catagory, but I thought I would try something a little different, this time around. Quite interesting little tale, the characters seem to have some of the a- typical attributes of those in society today. I kind of thought that Sabrina would be a problem but Stephanie should really be ashamed of herself. And just like real life situations Malik, seemed to have conveniently reappeared in her life just when she's got someone else.Her sister Jasmine on the other hand should have dropped Derek as soon as he got locked up and experience the mama drama.Entertaining but not overtly."
5,Excellent and comprehensive book of soil analysis,"This book is a comprehensive manual of soil physical, chemical and biological analysis, particularly if you are dealing with carbon sequestration. Methods are up to date and include limitations. I highly recommend this book to grad students, postdocs and faculty members."
2,DEBRA EISENSTADT IS WRETCHEDLY BAD,"I'm not going to add my voice to the conversation about what Mamet wanted to convey, one way or the other. I just wanted to make very clear my very strong opinion--Debra Eisenstadt is an ATROCIOUS actress. I know Mamet directed the movie (and I love THINGS CHANGE and HOUSE OF GAMES) but why he cast Eisenstadt is a bigger mystery than the one at the center of THE SPANISH PRISONER. She is so inept, devoid of any kind of ability to be natural--which is how Mamet writes; naturalistically. STYLISHLY naturalistic, but still--it's supposed to flow like real speech. And she is stiff and has no sense of the rhythm of the dialogue. She is flat and affectless...simply put, she SUCKS. By the end of the movie, no matter what side of the argument you fall on, you want to beat the SH-T out of her just because she CAN'T ACT."
3,Cyan,"How can ""Singer Man"", ""Play Children Play"", and ""Storybook Feeling"", not be included in a ""Best Of"" Three Dog Night Album??? They are great songs and very popular every place I was in 1973!! I have all of their Greatest Hits and had to get this CD for these three songs; thankfully they are all on one album. S. W. Toledo, Ohio"
1,Not Like the Comedy Central Special,"Wow what a step backwards. Not at all like the Comedy Central Special. If you like foul language, drugs, and screaming then this is for you. This DVD contains jokes about SIDS, Coat Hanger Abortions, and Catholic Priest Sex Offensenses. Topics that are never funny. I regret buying this DVD. I watched it once and threw it away. He could be so much better if he cleaned up his act."
2,Wished it had worked,"Got item fast, and in good condition, but was not compatible with my canopy for my 1990 Jeep Wrangler.Mine may have been an after-market canopy.I would buy from again."
3,car and driver back issue,I was not satisfied with the transaction. Vendor was in the process of a move and forgot to send I had to write twice to find out where my order was. They were apologetic and did get the package out they said it was going out overnight priority but I didn't receive it until 4 days later. Then when I got it it had the wrong front cover on it. I was really upset. They said they would take the return but I would be out the shipping . Would not buy from this vendor again.
3,Okay,It was good for first few months...now it has got stains on it which dont go. i think its okay for the price
5,Hawaii Anyone?,"Aww...what a great show. The Brady Bunch is finally getting the respect it so rightly deserved for so many years. Growing up in the '80's, I grew up with the Brady's. Re-runs were on every evening and I simply enjoyed every moment and memory that they provided. This 4th Season probably contains some of my favorite episodes including: The Hawaii vacation (3 episodes), The Subject Was Noses, & Today, I Am a Freshman. I just love The Brady Bunch - they made me feel happy and safe as a kid, now being older, I love being able to reminisce and savor that happiness and comfort all over again. Cheers to The Brady's!!"
4,Respond to Visual Stimuli,"This is a great, small book of images. They are compiled in a systematic arrangement that causes some questioning. I can offer no interpretation of the selection of images, because the experience is so individual. This is an excellent buy for anyone interested in challenging thier visual experiences and expanding thier ideas of non-lyrical viewing."
1,Maudlin,"I bought it because I am one of them. I regret it, and have often thought about throwing it into the dustbin, although I do not normally throw away my books. I find it effusively and tearfully sentimental. It is superficial ad nauseam. I should recommend A Country Doctor's Notebook by Mikhail Bulgakov instead."
3,Beautiful but....,This watch is beautiful and came in beautiful packaging. After a week the pin in the wrist ban had came out. Not wanting to have to ship it back and do without my watch I took it to my jeweler. In a few days it was out again. I had to end up supergluing the pin back in. That has held so far.
4,B.O.B reviw,This movie is such a great depiction and illustration of the Battle of Britain. This takes you through an in depth look at the Battle of Britain and the last straw for the free world of Western Europe as we know it. The director amazingly put this piece of art together helping me to understand the real and intriguing and herpoic story of the Battle of Britain and the tyranny behind the R.A.F and the fallacious Communist Nazi Germany coming to its end.
3,"Good Sampler, But It Makes Me Wanna Holla...","...it has MPG's masterworks, ""What's Goin' On"", ""Trouble Man"", ""Let's Get It On"", ""I Want You"" and a treat in the Marvin & Diana cut ""You're A Special Part of Me"", but they were done in a compilation somewheres already and done better. Good for the 1st time Marv fan, but other than that stick to the Original albums produced by Motown and Columbia records."
5,Forces sweethearts:heart throbs of wwII,I was born during the early stages of the war and grew up listening to the music I hear when this CD is being played. This is a good selection of the tunes I heard when I was a child. On top of that the Living Era collections have been always among the best compilations there are in the market. I really enjoy listening to this music.
2,"Are ""new recordings"" ever good?","Buyer beware: the track list above is WRONG. This Cd has 14 songs and they are ""New"" (meaning crappy) versions of these songs. I wanted to ear the original ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" and boy was I disappointed. I am going to send my CD back to Amazon because they have given bad info here. I thought I was getting 27 songs, instead I get 14 re-treads.Not my scene at all."
2,Sore neck,"Can't tell whether it was a good practice or not because I was always looking at the TV to see what they were doing. Kinda hurts the neck to look backwards at times. He doesn't say forward bend or triangle pose like my other dvd's do. On them I never look at the TV because I hear what they are doing. I don't really care if he touches the girls or says things to them, I just want to know what the heck we are supposed to do."
5,Great for Marketing,I will never look at being told No in the same way....easy quick read and huge impact on my life
5,Refreshing,"Go For No was a selection for a book club I facilitate at the credit union I work for. Since introducing the book last year, all new members of our lending and executive management team are required to read as part of their orientation."
2,Save yourself the time,"I can't really understand the ratings given here. This book came across as something that was thrown together to provide the author a way to promote his speaking business. The story as it's told is not at all interesting and the lesson is a thin one.Anyone who has ever sold will tell you the more no's you hear, the more likely you are to be successful. That is what this book so painfully tells you in far too many pages. Nothing new or interesting here.If you want to learn to sell, I would look at SPIN Selling, Common Sense Selling, or Solution Selling. All of these books are far more informative."
4,Very good.,I fully enjoyed this book. I thought it was just a sample since it so thinbut it turned out to pack a big punch.
4,True Family Fare,"At Jesus Side is true family fare! We had a 4-year old, an 80-year old, and everything in between. It's a fast paced, funny, touching story of a gang of misfit animals learning the power and joy of forgiveness and redemption. We laughed and cried during the show, and at the end, you feel great! I highly recommend it."
3,not a bad harddrive,"My harddrive died within two weeks of getting it; I wasn't using it often, and it died while I wasn't using it. WD did mail me a replacement within two days though, and since then I've had no complaints. It's size is convenient and handy and it looks cool."
5,Great Little Hard Drive,"I wanted a portable 120 GB USB HD to store video files, mostly as a backup, and also for movies. As you know, video files are large files, and this little hard drive handled them just fine.I have a PC, not a Mac, so no power shortage issues. It's a very attractive drive with a sturdy case, and really a steal of a deal around $100. Then you add the WD reputation for durability, and how can you resist it ?This drive is working beautifully. I don't think you will be disappointed."
1,Very Costly Paperweight,"I am having the same issue as the former reviewer using this drive with an aluminum Powerbook (Mac).... well, not using it is more accurate. I purchased the thing this afternoon because I needed to transfer work to my laptop for tomorrow... it's now 2:40 in the morning and I can't get the info off of the drive, so I will be up the rest of the night burning DVDs instead. Ugh. They really need to provide better documentation and note that it is too low powered for (certain?) laptops."
3,Just don't drop it !!!,"Worked fine until this morning, when I dropped it on a tiled floor from about chest high. Now it makes that wonderful clicking sound, my computer no longer recognizes it, and I've irrevocably lost 80GB of data. You cannot depend on these hard drives 100%. If you're backing up files, then at least you have 2 copies of your data. However, if you're like me and you decided to put important data on the drive and not have a copy of it anywhere else, then you're going to be in for some serious disappointment."
4,write error failure,"freak!!! it won't let me change my star rating. I rewrote my review ofr this product. google ""write error failure wd passport."" You'll get a lot of hits on this one. I've had it for several months now, and this thing was always a bit of a worry. When I tried to safey remove the hd, it wouldn't allow me to safely remove even after 10-20 minutes of retrying and closing all my programs. So of course I removed it unsafely. So this kept on going for a while and then one day it gave me a write error failure, and I lost everything. Yeah not fun people...not fun. So I've been talking to WD tech, and went through all sorts of diagnostic tests and such, and yes surprise, there's an error. If you do purchase this, I would go to the WD website, look up the DLG software and run it for errors. If there are errors, I would contact tech support right away."
5,Good backup unit,"I bought this last September for $91.34 with shipping, and its been a life saver ever since, the only thing you have to be careful with is that when you go to plug it use the Motherboards USB slots (The ones in the back plate), don't use the front ports on your case because the front ports don't give enough power to the HD and can kill it in the long run. All laptop ports are good though."
4,Western Digital WDXMS1200TN 120 GB Passport USB 2.0 Hard Drive,"the only problem is the cable. is really short and you can't use USB extension because it doesn't supply electricity. otherwise the product is really great, small, fast and cute."
2,Watch out for insufficient power,"As other reviewers have noted, you may need a USB Y cable for this drive to work reliably. It droves me nuts until I figured it out today (I knew it wasn't a problem with my USB ports because I have a full size USB drive with its own power supply that works reliably every single day).The real lesson: if you can afford it, go with Firewire for portable drives. That is the only interface that has enough power to reliably power a portable drive. But USB is usually cheaper...you get what you pay for."
4,"Sleek & effective, if you can figure out how to use it","The USB 2.0 Passport is sleek, slim and light. It fits into a little pocket inside my PC briefcase. Works well but it comes with no user manual -- only a quick installation guide. And the support portal only provides the quick installation guide. A little advice to the user on the variety of ways to use the Passport would be helpful."
2,Not worth it,"I started having problems with the drive almost from the beginning. I'm a student and I wanted the drive to keep all my work in one place as I moved from one computer to another in the various labs. First thing I noticed is that some computers wouldn't even recognize the drive. That seemed to be a power issue, their USB interfaces weren't pushing enough juice to spin up the drive. I simply learned which machines it worked with and which it didn't. Then I had some corruption issues which forced a reformat of the drive. Now, I'm back to the problem of the drive not being recognized. I've got an RMA from Western Digital and am returning it under warranty for replacement. However, I would return it for refund if I could. I don't need the full 120 GB and would opt for an ArcDisk if I had it to do over again."
2,It was fine.. WHEN IT WORKED!,"This drive was ok when it worked, now it is not recognized by my computers. Just google this. wd hdd not recognized and you will find a lot of forums! I have spent two days trying to make this thing work! and I have a lot of information in this disk. I just wish I had not bought this drive."
1,"Purchased - Faulty, Replaced - Faulty, Replaced Again - FAULTY AGAIN =(","I purchased this product from Amazon. Received it in the mail, was so excited when I plugged it in, and all I heard was ""click...click...click...click"". No response from my computer. After researching the forums, I learned my drive was faulty and had to be sent in to be replaced. Fine, no problem. Sent it in, got it again 1 week later. ""Click...click...click...click."" Same issue. Had to package myself and pay for shipping once again. Got the replacement today. I thought, this couldn't happen 3 times, could it? Third time is the charm, right? nope. SAME EXACT PROBLEM AS THE LAST TWO DRIVES. I received no apology letters or emails, no expressions of concerns for my troubles, or even offers to pay for shipping. I'm through with Western Digital, at least with this product. Don't go through the same trouble I did."
2,Hard drive is good but the software it comes with sucks!!,"The hard drive itself is OK but the software that comes with it to sync your data sucks big time!! The interface looks like it's from Windows 3.1 and not user-friendly. Also, it doesn't automatically backup new folders created on your hard drive!! Of course I found out about this in a very painful way! I lost some files then I told myself I was safe because I backed up the day before but the files weren't there. What a horrible software from the stone age!!"
1,Broke after 2 weeks,"I bought the 80 gig version and it failed after 2 weeks. I performed the test to find the problem and the drive was unable to complete the test, probably because it sounded like the hard drive was spinning very sloppy and possibly contacting something else. I e-mailed WD the results of my test (failed to complete test) and they obviously didn't read the E-mail because they answered me telling me to take the same test I had attempted several times. They do not repair disks, only replace them and the hassle to replace it was a real pain, I refuse to put ANY important information on this drive because it is terrible quality."
2,Subtitltes...,I did not finish watching this. My hubby does not like subtitled movies. No where does the description mention subtitles.
5,Amazing movie.,"I am a guy, and this movie is one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen, it even put me in tears. It's really touching, but it really shows how serious Cyber bullying really is."
4,Junior Brown Brings Fun Back to Country and Western,"Junior Brown brings a style to country that's been missing for a long time. ""12 Shades of Brown is Junior at his best... tongue and cheek lyrics and witticisms linked with a distinctive and superior level of guitar playing. Seeing Junior live is an extraordinary experience (he does for country what Louis Prima did for swing on stage). This album's a delight!"
4,Great Drivin' music CD...Brown's second and second best still!,"Junior Brown has turned on New Agers, hippies,Country fans and even the Anti-Country crowd!Now that's appeal. He's done a few guest shotson shows awhile back and had some lipton teacommercials, too! The boy has just got it!"
1,Didn't work out so well.,I bought these made by another company 3 years ago and they are awesome. I found this brand on Amazon and decided to order them. Big mistake.I bought them in June of 2011 for use early in 2012. I took them new out of the package about 7 weeks ago and put 5 of them around tomato plants just as I did the other brand.Three have already failed due to the seam between the tubes splitting. Sorry piece of junk that didn't even last 1 season. Guess I won't be buying these again.
2,The quality may be slipping.,I just bought a new set fo wall o water.The first one was great and held the water.This new set I purchased has had difficulty holding water. One of the three held water in all of its tubes. The other two have 3 or 4 tubes that keep getting empty the day after filling.I am sorry to see that the are empting... maybe its there way of have the wall of water... water your plants
1,JUNK!,"I bought this to get a better ride quality. Now, my tires are cupping (a lot of vibration) and it is too late to return it. My 10-year-old shocks had no tire wear issues what so ever. I have exact same problem with tire cupping in my car after changing Monroe strut. These cheap Monroe shocks are going to cost me $1000 for new tires, which still had 3-year tread life on it. ALL MONROE PRODUCTS ARE JUNK! I will NEVER buy another MONROE PRODUCT AGAIN!"
5,Very educational and heartwarming,"Mike Holmes is amazing. He takes people's construction problems and not only solves them, but fixes other problems he sees while he is doing his original fix-up. Only if all constractors were like him..."
5,Amazing debut,"Considering the circumstances regarding this recording, this is a miracleof the jazz vocalist's art"
3,Interesting Topic but Short on Details,"I was fascinated by the topic of entanglement -- the quantum reality that particles separated by a distance can ""communicate"" with each other. Strange indeed, but the book provides experimental evidence supporting this unusual concept. I enjoyed the physicist's personal profiles that play a role in the history of entanglement, sometimes finding it a bit distracting from the scientific finding though. The diagrams of the experiments are a bit difficult to follow, the explanations too brief, and the attempts, occasionally to write ""math equations"" frustrating. I understand the need to write for the lay person, but the book falls short of those of us with some math background and physics knowledge. If only the book had illustrations equal say, to Scientific American, with equally good explantions, we would have a scientific bestseller. I enjoyed the book but it falls short of being really scientific."
3,Shameful !!!,"I enjoyed watching ""The Life of Verdi"" when it was on Television. I like it so much I bought the series when it came out on VHS tapes. When it came out with the DVD version, I bought it without reading the reviews, thinking it would be even better in video quality. It was the biggest mistake I ever done. The quality of the DVD was so bad it is shocking. With its many visual flaws, it is actually worse than my video tape version.I will never have the confidence to buy from this company again. Never in my life have I bought a DVD with such regret.They should be ashamed for ruining such a enchanting mini series.As much as I enjoy the series, I would not recommend it to anyone until they can do a proper transfer from the original source. The company should not be rewarded for such scandalous effort."
4,Nice,"This controller is a nice addition to any halo fans collection, but unless you really want the figure there is a rush to get one. Aside from aesthetic changes its identical to the regular controllers. The image resists scratching reasonably well. Also, the black battery pack matches this controller but unfortunately isnt included."
1,DESIGN FLAW - Battery Pack does not stay connected!,"i have no idea how they messed up the best looking halo controller with an awesome bonus. unfortunately the other bonus is the battery pack refusing to stay in contact with the controller and it turning on/off at the slightest movement. I have one for a week and had to play perfectly still; not common or easy for halo.WHEN WILL THEY ISSUE A RECALL?I wanted it to work and to keep it, but it is unusable.Well done microsoft."
2,Not great.,"Works almost as well as a standard 4"" long handle scraper. Almost, but not quite. Blade not sharp enough."
1,Don't get fooled by the looks...the knob looks like a scoring tool...,Don't get fooled by the looks...the knob looks like a scoring tool...but it's not...it's a scam...they advertise this as Wallpaper Remover and Wall Scraper Tool...wanting to make you believe that it has a scoring tool built in...but when you open the package all you really get is a wall scraper...I'm never going to buy any Zinsser product...their DIF product is also another fine example of a useless product...using DIF and this scraper tool was quite a horrid experience...I wasn't able to get the wallpaper border completely out in spite of scraping really hard...and even with two coats of paint the residual wall paper is still visible in some areas.
5,Works as Advertised,This is a handy tool to use in conjunction with the wallpaper removal gel. It stays flat on the wall to remove any residual wallpaper without gouging the wall. The blade can be removed for easily cleaning or replacement.
1,useless product - extremely inaccurate,"Never buy this product. This is a useless ear thermometer. If I did not use a regular digital thermometer to double check than I would assume that this ear thermometer is accurate ( when regular digital was reading 101 & this ear thermometer was reading 98.6). I am very upset with this ear thermometer, I am now just use regular digital thermometer."
5,Omron MC 514 Ear Thermometer ......,"This is an easy-to-use, ear-friendly ear thermometer that can be used by the entire family. It's lightweight and easy to handle, and the temperature scanning is great."
1,Unreliable,"Gives huge difference in readings within 10 minutes, I've had this for 2 years now and never felt that the readings were accurate."
1,POOR ACCURACY,"I bought this from Amazon and I don't like it - I need to take 5 or 7 measures to be sure about the values, The diferent from the firt measures to the 7 measure is 3 degrees, I have a baby 6 months old and for me is a problem to take a lot of measure. In conclusion IS TO BIG INACCURATE."
2,Ear Thermometer,Save your money! This is a very confusing piece of work.....still have not figured it out....
5,Comfortable shoe,"Great sneakers, but can't find them anywhere and my pair are nearing retirement. Look good, very comfortable. Would buy them again if I could find a pair."
4,Chelsea is that you???,Chelsea is very hot and I love her cozie!!!!how ever what happened with those pants ugh- not chelslove how you can store things in her bagBIGGEST MY SCENE FAN EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Interesting Premise, Sci-Fi Soap Opera","I enjoyed exploring the science, I enjoyed Czerneda's new ideas and engaging plotlines, but where are the interesting people with consistent personalities? Where is the natural-feeling interaction and reaction? Why did the entire book seem so socially amateurish? I felt like there was a disturbing lack of thought regarding character development and character interaction. I was simply unable to feel resonance of any kind with any of the characters, and thus it was almost a chore to finish."
1,Pointless and boring,"After an exciting beginning, the majority of the plot finds the heroine languishing in her quarters on an alien spaceship, seemingly forgotten by her ""hosts."" This pointless delay contributes nothing to the plot. It's as if the author had more pages to fill without any good ideas. At the end (Finally! The end!) the climax is so sudden and so unsatisfying that it made reading this book (and hoping for something great to happen) a complete waste of time."
3,Pretty but pointless,"I found this one to be the equivalent of a literary painting. Pretty, but in the end pointless. The world building is great, the characters seem real but in the end I still don't know what the book was supposed to be about."
3,NOT up to the Webshifter standard,"It's odd when all the best clues to a mystery are unnoticed by the protagonist even AFTER it's solved. A biologist who samples biota should recognize the same behaviour in others, and she should easily recognize the dangers of an intelligent species that grows too fast and recklessly destroys the environment. Mac's job is the study and protection of salmon populations, for pity's sake.Czerneda's writing is generally very adept, so it may be an editor's fault that italicized passages intended to be a character's thoughts are not treated like dialogue, as they should be. For instance, Maybe she was learning to deal with repeated shocks should have been Maybe I'm learning to deal with repeated shocks! -- or else it shouldn't have been italicized at all. I may be the only one annoyed by this, but I was VERY annoyed.I give the Webshifter books 10 stars (out of 5), the Trade Pact series 4 and a half, and this book? Barely 3."
5,Absolute elegance,"This salute to songs associated with Fred Astaire with a few asides to Cole Porter is exactly what a tribute to Fred and Cole should be, ellegant. The piano playing by Mr. Ross with an assist from Bruno David Casolari is shear perfection, totally matched to the style of these wonderful wonderful songs. Mr. Ross also gets a backup group of four singers, who sing in a tight harmony 40's and early 50's style, when more of these songs belong to the 30's and very early 40's, but they are still very much within the style. All in all this CD is great fun and a completel joy."
2,Good info...but painful to read....,"This book contains a lot of useful information, but it is poorly written. Take pages 28 and 29 for example. How many boxes containing ""It should be noted....blah, blah, blah"", saying the exact same thing, do we really need? I felt like I was a fourth grader reading this book. I'm not certain who the target audience is, but I struggled through this book and often felt like it wasn't worth the time trying to find the useful information buried in all of the redundant fluff. I want to take the book seriously, but it just isn't written in a way that I am able to do that. I think the author could easily take the important stuff, streamline it, and make a more practical (and much shorter) guide for someone older than 16."
3,good resource,"A traditional and standard text for those considering job and career changes. A little dated,even though it is ""updated"" regularly. Lots of good reference information, though."
5,need a job? you need this book!,"i hadn't heard of this book until someone suggested i look into it. boy am i glad they did! it's the best resource i've found!this book is _full_ of extremely useful advice in how to find and get the job you're looking for. each page is full of information that may seem like common sense but is often overlooked and not taught to job seekers. the sections on how to interview and discuss salaries are especially helpful. it takes you through step-by-step and prepares you for anything and everything that might come up. covers everything you need to know about finding and getting the job in clear examples, charts, worksheets, etc.a must have for any college graduate or those looking to start a new career!"
5,"A Must for all Job hunters, College seniors and Career switchers","There parachute legacy continues, this is the most complete career-guide. I used this book as a college senior and it has worked wonders for me. The best thing about this book is probably the Dick Bolles's stright forward advice about job hunting. If you you are in college; you really should have this one in your bookshelf."
4,Good!,"I am only 15, when I read this book, I was confused by it. I kept reading it and finally I finished the book. It came to a point where I had to write a critical analysis for it in my English class. My teacher had so many questions about the book that I didn't quite know for sure what the answers were myself. I couldn't figure out why Larry Watson wrote this book, what was the theme? I came to many ideas, but settled on one; maybe he wants to tell us that we should open our eyes and see the great things that are right in front of us that we didn't even know they're there. I figured Paul based his life around Laura and he couldn't see how much his girlfriends, mother, father, sister, wife, or kids meant to him, until he lost his wife and kids for a while. He couldn't see that he had this wonderful life because his obssesion with Laura blocked everything else out, but Laura. I'm not quite sure that I'm right about it but, I really enjoyed reading this book as my second novel."
5,AWSOME MUSIC,"This is a WONDERFUL CD and I recommend it to anyone. The sound appeals to people who are into any kind of music since it combines an element of pop, rock, punk, and funk! Cann't wait for MELEE to come out with a full length CD!!! :) They put on a great live show too!"
4,The Inspirational Guide Book,Joe Vitale guides the reader through many of life's milestones with his powerful advice and insight. This short read is very inspiring and would be an excellent gift for anyone open to the power of The Secret.
5,Miraculous Canals of Venice,"This is an intriguing video of how the city of Venice was formed through innovation and hard work. You'll be wanting to visit after viewing the scenes of ancient times as well as modern-day Venice -- beautifully filmed and interestingly narrated. One of the best ""travelogues"" ever!"
5,Amazing Norwegians,"This band has done everything. Including being a huge band in their own country, they have also been a profiled band in the rest of Europe. In their earlier years they have experimented with a little bit harder rock, but on this album they show that they can handle many music catogories. They have been proclaimed geniuses, and that title suits them. This album is butter smoothe, and just sends shivers down your spine, and shows the world that Norway has more than Lene from Aqua to brag about. These guys know how to make music. Nuff said."
4,The Head Review,"This book was really exciting.I like how there really into video games because i like them too. Then a lady comes to the door. She was a friend of his aunts. She had something for him, a shrunken head, that was cool. The next thing you know he see's it glowing. That's pretty freaky. Then he get's invited to come visit his aunt. His aunt's name is aunt Benna. he flies to the jungle. I like on page 71 he is sinking into sand just like in his video games, if they sunk into sand they lost. Anyway, he goes in the jungle and to a lab. There are many people there. They all work there. First there nice but then they get a little strange. then he finds out he has powers. The shrunken gives him these powers.It is scary in the most of the book. In one scene he thinks he hears his aunt right behind him but I won't tell you. I think I've told you enough of this book. If someone asked if I could rate this book one through ten I would give it a eight."
3,A o.k book,This was the first bok i read in englisk(i am an Norwegian girl) I thing it was a wery god bok but my favorit part var det vit the svamp
2,Very poor effort by EA sports,"This game looks cool and had potential. The graphics look like Super Nintendo quality. Every single pass is a completion, whether you throw it 5 yards or 50 yards. Every now and then there will be an interception, the ball NEVER hits the ground. It all comes down to who has the ball last. Really not what I expected, this game is nothing special, and there is a reason its only $30."
2,Don't Do It,Worst Game I have ever played. Period. Felt like i was playing Madden 1998 the only thing that was missing was Eddie George. Horrible. Don't waste your time.
2,Pure drivel,"This book is the worst, trashiest book I have ever read. It was about topics that trashy people like to read and I wish I would have realized that sooner than when I actually started reading. Just nasty, dirty, messages which didn't lead out to one thing. Be smart, and get a different book instead. The only reason that I gave this book 2 stars was because I felt so dang sorry for it!! It's just one of those trashy teen novels people label literature. Try some REAL books instead."
3,A good book,"This book I'm writing a review for is Pretty good. It told some great ghost stories. First of all it was very orginized,for example it had chapter introductions. Also this book has a lot of great tales. Some of them might even take place in your state. In this book thier are 48 tales that incude The ghost with flaming fingers,Ghost on the beach and The white pidgeon.But befor you go and buy this book I would like to say that I would'nt recomend this book for young chilodren. For some of the story's are very disturbing and others were very gory,some even made my stomach turn. I mean I was ten when I read this book and it gave me nightmare's. I would without a doubt recomend this book for age's 11 and up. But all around that the book was fine. Sadly I took two stars off for that gory and down right sick contents that lie in those pages. I hope this review was helpful,Thankyou."
5,Dermatologists love this book!,"This is an incredibly valuable book! Congratulations, from one dermatologist to another, on finally making sense of acne for patients and for doctors! I learned a great deal that will enhance my practice and I will recommend all of my acne patients buy this book. Thank you for such a well written, easy to follow reference guide to acne! Ellen Marmur, MD"
5,I dig this story,"This is a good Spider-man back story about Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy, and MJ. Peter hasn't got over Gwen's death and he's retelling the story of their meeting, and him meeting MJ."
5,RE-PUBLISH THIS BOOK!!!,"This book needs to be published again. Sergei Kourdakov was the persecuter like Paul in the Bible, but then Jesus saves him. It's amazing what God does through anyone He chooses. After reading this, I'm reminded that through my daily vocation, God uses me as His tool to preach the Gospel to all nations, by simply doing what is set directly before me with my whole heart.PLEASE PUBLISH IT AGAIN- I want my children's children to read this story!"
3,"Doc is good, the matches... not so much.","The documentary on Disc 1 is really good. Obviously, they couldn't cover the whole thing in 3 hours, but for the most part, they did a great job with the time they were given.The matches on Disc 2, range from ""OK"" (RVD/Lynn, their match from the previous PPV is better) to mind-numbingly dull (Sabu-Scorpio, which seemed to last for eons). Paul E often had problems booking straight up matches and had 100 people doing run-ins, plus a lot of the guys couldn't actually wrestle."
3,Good book not the beset of this writter,"The book overall is good. However, the begging and some motivation on the actors are not believable. At the end it books gets better."
5,David Morrell's best novel,"Though his more recent novels have been an enormous disappointment, ""Covenant of the Flame,"" is, in my opinion, David Morrell's greatest novel. It is everything a thriller should be: intense, exciting, interesting and intelligently written. I, literally, could not put this book down. If ever a page turner was penned, this book is certainly it. I usually don't re-read novels, but ""Covenant..."" is, without doubt, the exception. I highly recommend not only this book but also all the pre-""Assumed Identity"" ones which are also excellent. ""Assumed Identity"" signaled, as far as I'm concerned, the beginning of the end. As a once die-hard Morrell fan, I am more than a little saddened by the turn his writing has taken these past few years."
3,Average for Morrell,"The book was enjoyable, but doesn't compare to the gripping success of Morrell's finest (i.e. ""Brotherhood Of The Rose"", ""Fraternity Of The Stone"", and ""The League Of Night And Fog"", with the three being somewhat of a trilogy). Morrell is an exceptional author, but he seems less than inspired on this one...still, Morrell at his mediocre best is still much better than majority of writers on the scene today"
4,Terrific Program,"I'm not into detective programs but recently I've found that the forensics program, with all the scientific methods available to determine how a crime has actually been committed, is fascinating. Gary Sinise is really good in this and the rest of the cast contribute to the show to make for episodes that are well-paced and keep you paying attention to find out what ""ground truth"" is. The special effects help to explain what we're seeing and the writing makes the suspension of disbelief that much easier. I do wonder exactly how resources are allocated in real-life to solve some of these crimes. Just because you CAN spend 80 man-hours running down every fiber used in jeans from 1989 to 1992 doesn't mean you WILL..."
4,SEXY!,"Love this piece! I have had this piece for 2 years now and have had only minor problems. Yes, the moon does catch on the jeans once in a while, but nothing too bothersome. I will order another one as the one I have is just now starting to loosen up. I have had it drop off once, only because I didn't check it for tightness. Because I have cynched it up too much,the threads are too loose. It wants to tighten too much. My fault. All in all, I may order 2 just to have for a looooooong time! :)"
5,"Comprehensive, detailed coverage of material.","I highly recommend this book for anyone considering either or both of these construction methods. The author's experience shows in breath and depth of the subjects addressed in this book. I enjoyed the knowledgable way he writes of determining scantings, deck-to-hull details, and the laminating process itself. The detailed text is accompanied by excellent drawings and illustrations of the author's points. The author's Continental orientation is evident from the boats selected for illustration. The author goes into all facets of building using these methods, including mold building and backbone setup. If you wish to learn about the details and practical issues of using these methods, this is an excellent addition to your library."
3,"nice and heavy, but finish already having problems","I've had these for a few weeks now and they are nice and heavy, but we forgot one time and used a metal spoon and it scratched the finish already. The finish on the back/outside of the pan is already deteriorating as well, and we only handwash them. It is nonstick, but the instructions say to follow recipe directions and use nonstick spray or shortening or whatever if that's what the recipe says to do. I am not sure why because nothing seems to stick, but using the nonstick spray is starting to stain the pan already, and of course you can't use anything abrasive to get the stains off. Also, they certainly let the bottoms of some rolls burn, and some cookies got quite over done as well, so they sure don't stop that. I'm glad they were on sale and I bought them to replace the cheap crap I've always bought that is black and warped, so hopefully they will last."
2,Winds down to a flat conclusion,"Not really a romance, not much of an historical novel, because there is not enough made clear about the history. We don't get any depth of characters or even any sensuality. By the time we get to the last part of the book we don't get any interaction with the characters at all, just broad sweeping narrative. Tulip the eunuch as the narrator is just not exciting enough. By the end of the book there is so little detail it is like it was in note form. Don't let the sexy looking cover fool you into thinking you are going to learn about her in any depth. A biography gone wrong, with no real narrative drive. She had hoped to find stuff to support hr research, didn't so passed it off as a novel.Even the fact that she was a cousin of Josephine, Napoleon's first wife, is not very exciting (and a lot more could have been made out of it). She has no depth and is far too haughty and self-centred to be interesting."
5,Great Magazine,This magazine is full of interesting dog facts and great because it is also a magazine that will benefit my dogs future well being. I recommend this magazine to any dog lover out there!
4,Nikon sun-shade / 3x9-40mm only,It states 40 mm sunshade but it will not fit the 4.5 x 14-40mm A/O Nikon scopes only the 3 x 9-40 mm Nikon.
1,Every Good Author Entitled to one bad book...,"The story wasn't quite as involved from an historical standpoint as others by this author, but that was only one problem. Anna was a fabulous heroine, and she didn't deserve to have a man like Morvan, who was penniless, condescending, arrogantly unfair, and thought the world should have been his simply for the asking. I don't think there's ever been a hero who disgusted me, but this one did."
1,Morvan Not Even Close To Being A Good Hero,"There isn't a book by this author that I dislike, except for this one. I don't know what happened here. Morvan is not likable, not really very nice, and wanted wealth handed to him through a woman, no less. I just didn't like this guy, he was nothing like this great author's other heros."
1,Disappointing in the Extreme...,"I didn't read the series in order, and I loved Morvan in Lord of A Thousand Nights, although not so much in By Arrangement, and I must say he is the only hero in the series I do not like. He started out as a jerk and remained that way throughout the entire story!"
1,DO NOT READ THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the most horrible books I have ever read! Morvan was a sexist and controlling person and took away all of Anna's rights. He gave her a gift that she was overjoyed about, but it was something he had taken away from her in the first place. Anyone who values herself as a woman should stay away from this book. I was so disgusted halfway through that I only skimmed the second half. I also would suggest that no men read this in case they get any bad ideas. This book is a waste of time and money. Stay away!"
1,The Horses Did Him In,"The hero of this book, Morvan Fitzwaryn was conceited enough without adding more faults to his character, but somehow the author succeeded in doing just that. But the fact that this unimpressive man was pleased with himself for giving his wife Anna back her own horses and the fact that Anna profusely thanked him totally turned me off to this book. It was hard enough to take Morvan throughout the story, but that was outside of enough."
1,Morvan the Moron,"Could someone please tell me what Anna de Leon saw in this guy? He was not hero material, the storyline was not interesting because most of the book dealt with Anna's unhappiness-her depressed life ever since HE came into the picture. Unlike most heros, he had nothing going for him except possibly his handsomeness. Even that couldn't save his boorish personality, though."
3,Below standard,Expected much more for this kit!! i build it in 2 days!!!! Didn't have any fun!!! and the cockpit part is awful!!
4,Colorfully Illustrated,"Written for young children, this story could be a good one for initiating discussion about using our words to build others up. The brightly colored illustrations attract children's attention, and the moral of the story is clear and appropriate for young children.The story itself, however, is rather mediocre, and the many hurled insults, if read over and over as children often do, could have the negative effect of being picked up by the children.This might be a good book for one-time readings by teachers or guidance counselors, when a carefully guided discussion can follow."
3,Not interesting,I was bored reading the book so I started skimming the pages. I will give it away and maybe that person will find it more interesting.
2,You get what you pay for!!,"Purchased this for my wife, who is somewhat computer-inept. Decided to preview it myself, so I could offer her help with it later on; however, it was I who needed the help! Very difficult interface,with No ""undo"" feature, or ""back"" button for duffers to erase the inevitable mistakes.This is an extremely maddening bit of software, which I am going to send back ASAP, and trade for something a bit more expensive, but hopefully, with a shorter leaning curve....Did I mention that in addition to no printed docs (a real pet peeve of mine) there is no OPTION of printing the docs yourself; only an extremely unhelpful ""help"" file.My advice? Forget this one!"
2,history,interesting for anyone doing research on history of the United Statesdetails are there. not a LONG book to review
4,"Kelsey is very funny; sadly, her situations are true","Having lived in small South Dakota towns, I recognize some of the characters and situations Kelsey relates in 'Bitch Unleashed'. The editing, however, left a lot to be desired -there were lots of typos and incorrect word usage. If you can get past those, you'll find great humor."
4,Excelent book. Essential for begginers.,"This is an excelent book, looking over all the major aspects of Qbasic, teaching you step-by-step how to create a sucessful Qbasic program. This book is great for begginers, but not for experienced programers who want to learn more about QBasic. I have been programing in QBasic for nearly 5 years and I only used it for my first year. But without it I could have never been such a good programer. Highly recommended for beginners."
3,OK for a Foreign Film,"This movie did have a good story to tell but it was slow in telling. However, acting was fine and it was another movie for telling the family a story. This covered a man coming out into the big world and took a big chance. All of the public was involved and so were the reactions of his family members, especially a son. Overall, as I said it was OK. Acting was good and the story line was fine for a beginner to see."
2,Not as good as it could have been,"The anime reminded me of Noir but with fillers and a lot less fun. Good presentation, excellent music, good idea but not well use for entertaining. The problem is that half of each episode feel like fillers. In all the anime, there are maybe 3 episodes that were good from the first to the last minutes. All of the other begin like fillers and take half the running time before turning toward the real story. I Rated it 2 stars because of the music, without it, it would have been only one star.Not recommended. Buy Noir instead :)"
3,Meh....,"Guess I had high hopes for this one....Pros:Heavy-duty feelNon-stickDidn't melt in my ovenCons:Leaks - poured in my batter and lifted up the entire setup and saw I had a good 50mL of it all over the counter... For the price I can't complain.To remedy leaking initially in the oven, I place the pan on a cookie sheet that has parchment to catch any of the leaking batter.However, I haven't found a good remedy for the initial leaking when filling the unit. Maybe just plan to make a little extra batter each time.Could always use it as a hat in the rain to keep your head wet... but oh wait, it leaks. Ho hum."
3,Leaked the first time I used it!,"I bought this specifically for a recipe I wanted to try. It leaked the very first time. I like how heavy it is, which is why I am giving it 3 stars instead of 1, but having to wrap it in foil every time is going to be a pain."
5,Doesn't stick or leak!!,"I have baked two cheesecakes so far. After baking and eating the first, I filled th espringform with water prior to cleaning. There was no leakage. Even after lifting it and moving it to the countertop, there was no leakage from the springform. The clapse on the side is easy to move and holds firm. No foreseeable problems at this time."
5,Spring form pan,I purchased this for my daughter who loves to cook. She is very pleased with the great quality. Shipped quickly and safely.
2,Not good for a water bath,"I didn't have any trouble with batter leaking OUT of this springform pan, but while baking my cheesecake in a water bath, water leaked in. Makes for a mushy crust. If you're just using it as a pan for regular round cakes, I have no complaint with this. But even when I wrapped it in aluminum foil, water found its way in."
1,"Only used a few times, now it leaks.","I was happy at first with the quality of this pan: it has a nice weight and beautiful non-stick coating. But I have only used it a handful of times over 6 months and now it leaks badly. Apparently the clasp has already weakened and no longer pulls the pan closed tightly enough to form a complete seal. It has a ""lifetime"" guarantee, but you have to send $7 for return shipping and handling to Cuisinart. Together with what it will cost to mail, it's hardly worthwhile, since I purchased it for $12.95."
2,Cuisinart Springform Pan Fails,"I ordered two pans. After the first baking, one pan no longer closed securely. Now there is a gap between the inside plate and the outside springform. I have no idea why this happened. The other pan seems to be fine."
3,A good overview,"This book accomplishes what it sets out to do, synthesize existing material into a simplified text. If you are looking for a good overview, this is a good book. If you are looking for mathmatical detail and methods, this may not be the book for you."
2,A little TOO basic; unless you're a KID!,"I bought three different titles similar to this one.Of those three, THIS one is NEVER used.Oh well!I meant well."
3,"Not bad, but deffinately not their best!","My husband and I purchased this dvd with hopes that it would be as good as most other wiggles shows. However we were slightly disapointed. This particular movie is not quite for the real young viewers. Our daughter did not like the ""villan"" Wally was a bit of a creepy character for small viewers. Think twice about this one if your little one is under 4. I would rent it first..."
5,Beautiful pan,"Non stick, easy to clean (some loaf pans have the angular corner or ""foldings"" that can be difficult to clean, but not this one), evenly distributing heat. It's a great product."
2,No Handles,I wish I had bought a bread pan with handles. It is very difficult to flip this while wearing gloves. That's my only complaint. But that is a biggie.
2,WARNING!! Flaky Non-Stick coating,"After only six months occasional use, the non-stick coating started to flake off of one of my two loaf pans. I will be contacting Cuisinart about it. It is very unfortunate, because these have been my go-to loaf pans when baking bread, and I would give them 4 stars otherwise as they have a nice weight to them and bake evenly. The only other major drawback to these pans is that the outsides are quite slippery which makes it impossible to grab a pan from a hot oven with only one hand.Both pans have been used and cleaned in the same way: bread baking and hand-washed, sometimes with a 30-min pre-soak."
5,A Perfect 10 !!!,"Robert Shaw delivers on his last recording before his untimely death. The recording flows smoothly from start to finish, and the choir follows Shaw's every move. Other recordings haven't delivered the inspired performance that this recording conveys. The NPR interview was also a nice touch as a lasting tribute.THIS IS A MUST HAVE--RECOMMENDED!!!!!"
4,Very nice for the basics,I have planned many trips to various parts of the country and next summmer it is to RMNP. I bought this book along with the Falcon guide to compliment eachother. This book offers what looks to be some great and more popular hikes. It has many full color beautiful pictures. If you are seeking more of an adventure though in terms of climbing some mountains like mt meekers or you would like to see more hikes in general if you were to choose one book i would choose the falcon guide. But i would reccomend buying both books as compliments to eachother. As a combination i would rate them 5 stars
3,"Backboard Destroyed, but Ball is Great","All I can say is that I love the ball. I love hitting my son w/ it. But the cardboard backboard is so damaged that I have to use tape to totally fix it. Rim and net is still perfect. hahaha. I still had this since 2006 in Japan. Just hang it anywhere you want. I still play w/ the messed up, jacked up, tape recovering backboard.I recommend to get it still. Its still a classic like what everyone else says, and the ball is nice, compared to that Glow in the dark. Now that ball is hella hard w/ batteries. Sorry for my language."
3,Doesn't quite work for me,The songs aren't as good as many of Abou-Kalil's and the instrumentation doesn't work for me. If you are a fan of Howard Levy (as you can probably guess- I'm not) this may be an excellent recording for you.
3,Buckcherry hasn't grown up....,"Which could be a good thing or a bad thing. Most bands change their sound at least a slightly from album to album, try to add something to the lyrics, tweak the arrangements, complicate the song structures, but Buckcherry managed to make _Time Bomb_ sound just like an extension of their first album. If you liked their first album, then you will like this one. The song writing and playing are of the same caliber, though I don't think either album has a track which can stand up to ""Lit Up."" I'm just glad that with all the crap on the radio, there's a band that can rock this hard in a classic, yet up-to-date style. I'd give this album 3-1/2 stars for being a solid effort, but not four because without growth, it sounds a little stale."
2,Looks good if you can get it installed,I guess I'm not the target audience as I had some trouble deciphering the install instructions (this was my 2nd screen protector after my BoxWave was about a year old) so maybe I was led astray by that experience. Anyway when using the squeegy to remove the bubbles... it ended up scratching the surface. I guess I should have had 2 protective films on mine but there was only one and that may have been the problem. Fit is almost perfect. Clarity (when not including the scratches) is actually better than the BoxWave. So it's possible I have a defective one.
4,No good recent production,"Neblett's voice isn't particularly attractive but even Tebaldi has problems with this role - and her Card Scene ends up being the best. Domingo is his usual, stalwart self, singing in his generic way that leaves you wondering what role he's doing now and what emotion is he supposed to be feeling... I don't know if Destinn & Caruso could have pulled this off but it didn't last long even with them. You REALLY want to like this opera, but in trying to write a ""modern"" very orchestra-rich piece it just doesn't have the right feel for the material. There's never been a satisfactory recording (whatever medium) of this thing and most likely never will be! I find, of the visual ones, this one does it best - which is why the 4 stars... I could go on picking the various parts of it, and performances, to pieces, but that wouldn't be fair. It's still ok once in awhile if only to say ""...but what if..."""
1,The worst game I played,I play with this game once and a while. All the games are boring. The only game I like is checkers.
5,"Bold, Funny, Audacious, Amazing Class of Comedians","Well, the humour and jokes performed by these five comedians are simply in a class of its own. There doesn't seem to be any school to learn from these comedians because they do it so naturally. Being from the UK, I find it unbelieveable to find how I can co-relate to what they were saying. They are not alone, because equally they are just a small section of American comedians, from a vast amount of even greater ones since past, that can tell humour in a way that leaves you gasping for air. I'm glad I bought this DVD"
4,Shaq & Ced's All Star Comedy,"This was the best show ever! I don't care how often I watch it, I still crack my side! I think Tommy Davidson was funny as always. I could have done without DeRay Davis...he wasn't funny at all to me and bordered on being a bit on having issues with women. ARIES SPEARS WAS HILARIOUS!!!! Can he do an impression...OMG!!! He was awesome, outstanding, off 'da chain! His impression of Charles Barkley and Shaq doubles me over in laughter every time I see it. And lets not leave out KEVIN HART---HE IS SO FUNNY, OMG!! He kept us in stitches especially talking about his family at Chuck E. Cheese's and about double dating....too funny to miss!!! I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS and watched for it to come out on DVD."
1,couldn't even finish it,"I can't even remember what the bit of the book I could make myself read was about, though the description of it sounds just as worthy now as when I gave into it before. All I do know is that I was terribly disappointed in this book to the point where I couldn't make it past a few chapters and sold it as fast as humanly possible to someone whom, I'm sure, simply adored it. It always strikes me as amazing (and frustrating) how so many seemingly intelligent people can read the same book and react so differently to it, because this book, my friend, promises a lot, but delivers NOTHING."
3,It was SO GOOD until the END!!!!!! WTF?!!!,"...................... The book was thoroughly a delightful read and had me laughing out loud occasionally throughout the book and also had my heart racing with anxiety at points... You really feel part of the story and of the family in the story and Gabriel's both good and bad endurances. For me, the character of Gabriel is very relatable.... Until the end of the book after a shocking major twist, there's no wrap up. It just leaves you hanging with your jaw slightly open.... (possibly because of the aftershocks of the twist or that the fact that the book ends there..?) I was livid and very, very disappointed. Such a great twist and no great resolution... ????Damian McNicholl, you better hurry up with the second novel, seriously!!!!"
4,Good Fridge Magnet,"Good ceramic magnet. Will hold several pieces of paper on the refrigerator. Not as strong as rare earth magnets, but much more affordable. Hard to beat this price."
1,Order canceled by seller,I never received my cook book. I don't know for what reason other than the seller said that they could not ship the item. The seller made no other offer.
5,remember the warmth,"These songs came from the time when I first began to really listen to music. Of course I had heard music and enjoyed it, but that was on my parents radio, and they chose the programs. Then, in the early sixties, came the greatest invention of the twentieth century-- the transistor radio. Suddenly kids could carry their own music with them everywhere they went and choose the stations they wanted. At the same time came the great television show, American Bandstand, which had to be the first show aimed directly at the teenager. and this was the time that Bobby Vee began recording, So naturally, his songs were some of the highlights of my happiest years.this CD brings back those memories back full strength. Any child of the sixties should love this album. I do!!These songs don't deserve the term ""oldies"". They are classics that hold up against anything being produced today."
1,Cologne gone bad,"As always, Amazon service outstanding. Have ordered every thing from books & DVDs to toys to blenders to exercise equipment lol, so expected to be thrilled with this product as well. Don't know what happened but the cologne had definitely gone bad. I don't mean as in was not as I remembered ... I mean it was actually foul. Was so disappointed... Would definitely order perfumes again from Amazon though ... obviously this was a fluke. LOVE AMAZON!"
2,Not what i expected,"The book is filled with black and white pictures of interviewed people. The book mainly consists of interviews with many people and their views on body modification, let it bee tattooing, piercing etc. Nothing about body art but more so about people that have practiced/played a large role in body art. Interesting if you are interested in ""famous"" people and their opinions about body modification but utterly useless if you want to know facts and information about it."
1,And still I wait...,"I'm not even entirely sure what I should put in this review, aside from sharing my complete and utter disappointment with this seller. I have yet to receive my book, I have yet to hear back from the seller after multiple attempts at contact... I would steer clear."
1,portable electric guitar amplifier,"I really was very disappointed in this product. It produces so much static noise I find it unusable. Only when the volume is turned nearly off will it produce sound without static... and it fits very loosely into both my guitars' jacks - so I think the plug is not quite in proper specifications (size) and may be the cause of the static - for me, it was just like throwing money away, and I would not recommend this to anyone. Buy a small amplifier that will at least be usable instead of this thing - even if it isn't as convenient to take with you.It also seems cheaply made - very light and fragile, and I think it is a product that was made where there is no quality control."
2,"Gets the job done, but swivels in the guitar","Title says it. It amplifies the sound, but swivels down once plugged into the guitar. There's no real way to make it point forward unless you prop it against a table or something."
1,Awful,I didnt like the book actually I just took it in my course but I think they should have teach us better book because it is really nothing interesting or beneficial
2,Frustrating load times,"I'm a huge fan of the metal slug series and hadn't until getting this been able to play both 5 and 6. The first thing I noticed is the INCREDIBLY long load times - we're talking at least 60 seconds from XMB to menu screen here. Once in the menu screen, expect another 40+ second load to get into character select for each game. Performance is adequate and playable, but there are lots of framerate drops making the experience much less enjoyable than it should be. Overall, a bunch of great games ruined by terrible porting."
1,"How to ruin your family, church and life!","Jack Hyles, untill his death in Febraury 2001 was nothing more than a cult leader. His sermons were nothing more than exercises in his immense ego and pride. As a former student at Hyles-Anderson College, who was taught out of this book. I saw first-hand the hero worship that was heaped upon this man by mindless followers (myself included). Luckily I realized how misguided this way of thinking was and left the college/cult.If you really want a taste of the Hyles Cult, order some of his old sermons tapes from Frist Baptist Chruch of Hammond, IN and count the number of times he uses the word I or uses himself or his life as an example. You'll be surprised at the results.I welcome anyone to e-mail me to dicusss this further."
5,ALSO LOVE CASRLES,VERY INTERESTING TO ME. OF ALL THE PLACES THEY ARE. THE PEOPLE THAT LIVED IN THEM. THE LAND SCAPE IS BEAUTFUL.
2,Disapointed,"Well I expected a lot more from this book due to the big write up it got. Maybe I was looking in the wrong place, but I just found it way too clinical. I suppose for some it is a good reference tool. For me however, I felt that I could have gotten all this info and more off the internet."
5,the best pregnancy book on the market,This book answered any question I ever had while pregnant. I bought other books and was disappointed. This is the only book you need.
5,Easy Informative Read,I am really enjoying this book. The illustrations are great and the information very helpful. It is written in a quick easy to follow format. It is easy to go back and find information you want to read again.
5,"Excellent book, extremely informative!","This book is great. It is very easy to read and provides a comprehensive week by week overview of your pregnancy. Provides detailed information on what to expect before, during and after pregnancy. I highly recommend this book to anyone trying to get pregnant or currently expecting."
5,Good book,I am pregnant with my first baby and I wanted a book to explain me all the transformations that are going on. This book is very helpfull and it does not scare you at all. I think it is a very good choice.
5,Best Pregnancy Book,"This is the best pregancy guide! I bought it when I first found out I was pregnant, mostly to follow along with baby's development, which is well explained, informative and well organized. In addition to explaining what happens with baby week by week, it also covers what happens in your body, when to call the doctor and what to expect.Now I'm 7 months along and still amazed how comprehensively this book covers what seems like any and all topics you might want to educate yourself for pregnancy, birth and post partum: information on birth positions, medical/pain relief options, natural pain relief options during labor, breast feeding, bottle feeding etcetc - it's all there, well explained and presented in a completely balanced way. Truly a great resource no matter how many other books you might be reading (like I have).PS: I also have ""What to Expect"", and never went back to look at it again after I got this one... They don't even compare."
4,Great for the first timer!,"We felt this one was the best step by step, week by week guide. It assisted us in our planning at a level that we can understand. I highly recommend this manual. We did purchase other and we liked this one the best."
4,Very informative-not my favorite though,"I really liked this book and I think it is a wonderful reference tool. I am glad I had the book on hand. However, my favorite book during pregnancy was ""Pregnancy Week By Week"". I think it went more into detail as each week passed. And being a first time mom, I wanted to know every detail that was going on developmentally with my baby."
5,Excellent book!,"This book is worth it! I'd buy used since it's the same material. Very helpful, without making you over worry about things."
5,Excellent Resource,"If you know nothing about financial statements, this resource is for you. This text does an excellent job explaining financial statements and ratios. You'll learn the meaning of each statement and each ratio and how to use these together to monitor the health of your business in general and in comparison to others in your industry."
5,Best Erhu,"Having become attached to Erhu music while living in Korea, I've purchased several CDs of Erhu music. This one is my favorite."
5,Outstanding,"More than I expected, if you enjoy chinese instrumental music, this is thecd to buy. Relaxing and soothing music makes you forget about the stressesin your daily routine."
4,Cool story not scary,"My first grade son likes this story. It is about a 1st grade student who was told a lie by the 2nd grader that Mrs. Watsons wants well all her student's teeth. She is scared first, but then she finds out the truth and knows that it was only a rumor. My son could relate to this story because he hears story about teachers in his school which are not true most of the time. This story started a great conversation with my child about rumors what to believe and what not to regarding what he hears from other kids in the school or in the bus."
3,Gruesome tale of body horror,"The TARDIS deposits the Doctor and Peri on a windswept island where they encounter in rapid succession a strangely taciturn man and a funeral cortège. Both these are clues to the strange happenings that are starting to engulf the small fishing village on the island...The Sixth Doctor's era is rightly remembered as the most gruesome of the TV series, and this book fits right in. Taking a lead from movies like 'Night of the Living Dead', the Doctor, Peri and newly acquired friends from the village progress slowly through a story that, at points, literally drips blood. Some of the occurrences are not for the squeamish. And you may find yourself shouting at characters who do things you know they shouldn't from what you've seeing various horror movies.Justin Richards ties the whole thing together with a suitably Who-style explanation, showing yet again the highly flexible nature of the series which can fit a horror gore-fest within its milieu without any problems."
5,VC gets its due,"Variable contrast paper has long been looked down upon by photographers. That has been changing over the last few years and this book should finally convince everyone of VC's role in the printer's toolbox. Everything is covered--from printing techniques to currently available paper brands and VC enlarging heads. The text is informative, accurate and readable. A winning combination."
3,"Useful, but not great.","The book is not as nicely produced and printed as other books on the market, such as Tim Rudman's ""Master printing course,"" (which is so pretty that I use it as a coffee-table book!). Anchell gives only a few examples of his prints, and the prints are very poorly reproduced. I did learn a few useful things from this book, though I could probably summarize them in a few pages."
2,Pace too slow for me,"I watched this DVD the other day and found it to be painfully slow. The host attempts to make the lessons easy to understand for very beginner players, but the result is that the lessons progress at a painfully slow pace; this even reflected in the slow method of speaking to the audience. While this may be a matter of personal taste, and other may disagree with me, I am sure there must be better instructional DVDs out there."
1,Not impressed,"I was not terribly impressed with this CD. Fortunately, I decided to get it from the library to see if it was good before deciding whether or not to buy it.Although the orchestration of the songs is well done, most of them simply were not meant to be performed by a chorus; and they sound terrible in that form. If you want some of the songs on this CD, I suggest you look at one of Disney's compilation CDs in the Classic Disney Vol. 1-5 series or the actual soundtracks of the movies."
2,This Bomb was a Dud,"Coppel's attempt to develop some suspense around the ticking of the Russian bomb planted in Canada fell short of the explosion that was planned. Very few of the book's characters (with the exception of the leading man and woman John Morgan and Anna Neville) had any depth or created any connection with the reader. The majority of the plot was predictable, and the wordy descriptions of unrelated events and happenings only dragged out the process of getting to the end. On top of clumsy dialogue and unneccessary quotations starting each chapter, Coppel has written a very uninteresting post-Cold War US/Russia thriller. The only thrill I had was finishing it."
4,The story the movie did not tell,"After watching the movie 'White Squall' I was fasinated by the concept that a sailing provided. It sounded like the best of all worlds. That to explore the world, life and attempt the music and rythum of the sea.Mr. Langford writes about a ship that spoke of all that with a lively narrative of places that we call ports of call. Quite frankly I wish it had been a longer book. For 8 months of sailing he leaves so much out. In my mind I already knew the sad out come but I wanted more. Even the mundane.I recommend this book for those who watched the movie or even those who did not. It adds depth. I would hope at some point that Captain Sheldon would also write one."
3,Fast Service,"I received the book within 5 days 2 days before classes started, great timing. Thanks to Amazon"
5,Love that man at work!,"This positive, heartfelt CD is just what the doctor ordered. The compilation of songs from Colin Hay's other CDs as well as a couple of new songs are relaxing and the lyrics so easy to identify with. I love this CD, I could (and do!) listen to it over and over again."
5,New Music Can be Fun,"The two-year-old review by Mr. Hamilton describes the contents of this disk very amply and cogently. No two pieces resemble each other in any but technical matters of harmony. Ades is at times as spiritual as Arvo Part, at times as whimsical as Ives or Couperin, whose ""Mysterious Barricades"" he recomposes. These little pieces are, for me, more enjoyable than the larger compositions of Ades that I've heard. Perhaps there is room in contemporary music for a brilliant miniaturist. I rather hope so."
4,The Grassy Knoll of Election 2000,"Unprecedented factually and dramatically tells the story of how the Bush Republicans disenfranchised thousands of Florida voters, effectively stealing the Presidential election."
3,Low key one sided documentary still interesting.,"This documentary goes into detail and at least lets the viewer understand the case against the Republicans who supposedely stole the Florida 2000 election for George Bush. It's one sided, but at least it's not sensationalistic and really does give one pause for thought. Definitely worth a look."
2,not for christams,i wish that amazon and all other sellers would idenitfy if the cd has ?? language. Children under ten love the hip hop and rap beat and rythm but as a parent i cant give my son a gift with language i dont want any one using around him - please some one compile clean hip hop on one cd - there are artist's out there who do one or two with out questionable language cant we get them all together
1,"if there was an option for zero stars, this cd gets it","if there was one point in my life where i feel i've wasted the most time, it was when i listened to this worthless garbage. If you knew what was good for you, you'd trash it if you've got it! Don't buy this! I found one on the ground and it was STILL a rip off! I wouldn't want anyone to hurl like I did after listening to Christina Aguilera's ""Dirrrty"" which is exactly what it is, and it belongs where all dirrrty things go... in the dump. About the only thing this cd is good for, is using as a frisbee, coaster, or trading in for a pathetic AOL disk"
3,Pretty good but not the best,This book was interesting but not that scary. It consists of accounts experienced by the author. Mny are wierd and some seem to be slightly scary while others tend to be unrealistic or over dramatic but I found this book to be an enjoyable light read.
1,~Extremely disappointed~,"I searched for organizing books, I read the positive online reviews - and purchased this book. It is the worst organizing book I have ever read. I was so disappointed. I did not glean one practical, useful, new idea from the entire book.If your goal is very basic organizing without regard for clutter or ease of cleaning.... maybe this book would work for you. If you like lazy susans and pegboards, maybe this book is for you.My focus in my home is streamlining storage, minimizing clutter, and making life easier and more efficient. This book didn't help with that.I am sending this one back, something I never have had to do!Sorry, author :("
4,Upgrading & Repairing PC's A+ Certification Study Guide,Extremely well written and to the point. Good cram sessions and review questions. All in all I would recommend this book for any A+ exam candidate.
4,Try it out!,"I have used it a few times since I bought it --and let me just say--it does the job! I haven't made the beef jerky as of yet. However, my son made banana chips, and they came out so good. If you want your banana chips crunchy -slice them thinly. If you want them a little crunchy on the outside, and soft on the inside, cut them about an inch thick....I also dehydrated some apples, and they came out good as well. I will go ahead and try to make the beef jerky this coming weekend, and experiment with other fruits and vegetables.The only thing is --there is no power button. You have to disconnect when you are done, and plug it in when you want to use it. But other than that, no complains."
5,great product,this kit is great. the jerky gun does a good job just dont force it.. the dehydrator does a great job in drying my deer jerky with out moveing any trays in 4 hours. you cant beat this system!!!!
4,Easy peasy!,"Having never done any dehydrating i choose an inexpensive way to get started. The packaging is easy, the shipping was fast, and the instructions are pretty clear.What's missing is the time needed for each type of dehydrating. This is probably left out because there are to many variables for each item that can be dehydrated. Thickness and sizes of the pieces being the major variable. My advice, fruit takes a long time 10 hours or more and still ends up gummy...probably because i am a beginner but it does take longer than expected. Jerky can be done in 4 hours for a good result."
4,"All Pieces There, Product Works Great","I ordered this product less than two weeks ago, and just got it a couple days ago. I was nervous that it wouldn't have all the parts, but when I opened it, I found everything there. So far, it works great. It's quiet, with a low hum that you barely notice. It fills the air with the scent of whatever you're drying, which I love. The instructions are easy, on the lid has a convenient temperature control and time-line for vegetables, fruits, and other food items."
4,haven't used it yet but commenting on service...,"Purchased this through Amazon and received it very quickly. It was missing the jerky gun kit (which was the main reason I selected this model). I was instructed to contact the company, who sent me the replacement part although it took several weeks. I haven't used it yet but am looking forward to it!"
4,Good for beginners,"This model is a good one for beginners. It works well, is easy to clean, and relatively light weight. I find that recipes which I follow typically take longer to dehydrate in this machine, but with time, I get very good results. It's a nice feature that this machine has an adjustable thermostat. I definetly recommend it for people interested in starting to experiment with dehydrating."
5,Works perfectly,"I've never used a dehydrator before, so have no comparisons, but I'm very happy with this purchase. It's well-made, works perfectly, and is easy to clean. I've dehydrated apples (super-simple and yummy!), cantaloupe, bananas, and mushrooms so far and they've all come out great. It does make a bit of noise, loud enough that I can hear the droning down the hall, but it's not horrible. It comes with grids for delicate items or herbs, plus two sheets for fruit roll-ups (which I haven't tried yet), a very helpful instruction book (especially for a newbie), and a squeeze ""gun"" to make jerky (which I will probably never use). I'm very satisfied and recommend this dehydrator."
5,Malcolm Holcombe,Have you heard the name...are you curious. Know that Hundred Lies is his hidden Masterpiece and if you are a songwriter this album will change you forever. 'Nuff said.
2,This book stretches the realm of the ridiculous,"Reading the synopsis I expected something a little far-fetched. Blonde american girl is swept away by mysterious desert sheikh and all that. But this book is beyond ridiculous. I could accept the rather absurd circumstances of the plot, but the characters' reasoning and motivation that attempt to move the plot along are so silly and vapid, I was very tempted to put the book down. On top of that, the heroine is just annoying. Why do people assume that ""old fashioned values"" has to be synonomous with stupid and naieve. The heroine expresses surprise and confusion when an obstetrician reccommended to her is a ""woman doctor""! Women in medical school? I didn't know I could do that. And here I have been chained to the stove all these years."
4,Very enjoyable,"I really liked this book. I thought the story line was well thought-out and I loved how strong the heroine was. I thought, however, that some of the writing was stilted and there were some places that she was explaining translations of words that didn't really have much bearing on the story, which took me out of the story slightly. On the other hand, she does an excellent job of describing surroundings and at times I felt like I was actually in the desert with these people."
2,I found it pretty shallow,"I got this book based on reviews here at amazon. I found the plot contrived, the characters not very believable, and the writing only so-so. I finished it, so it isn't in the ""I can't stomach it"" category, but I found several of the twists and turns unlikely, even given the characters as presented. It is not in the same category as books by Susan Elizabeth Phillips, Linda Howard, Elizabeth Lowell, Suzanne Brockman, to name other authors amazon readers have recommended whose work I found riveting, well-written, and fun."
5,Beautiful book,"I'm a Diana Palmer's fan, I like her style, and this story, she adds all ingredients to do a very beautiful book. The characters are strong, well defined, you can't stop to read. You share the emotions, Diana maintains me very entertained since the first pages."
4,Escape to the Middle East: A romance,"At first I thought this would be totally fluff and just like the usual romance novels, but I was quite impressed with the book itself. While it is quite unbelieveable, (afterall it is a book), I found myself transported. I actually finished the book in one day. I would highly reccomend it to anyone who enjoys a good romance novel."
3,Not on XBOX 360,"I bought this game for my nephew for Christmas. He has an XBOX360 and this game won't play on the XBOX360 without some ""stuff you have to do"" to get it to work...even though it's listed on the XBOX website as one of the games that will work. If you don't have extensive knowledge on how to re-work the system, don't buy this one for the 360."
5,The Hogfather,"Very Terry Pratchett. Almost word for word from the book. If the viewer is unfamiliar with the book, and the characters, then they may have trouble following the story and understanding some of the normal visual jokes. For example, the viewer may not recognize ""The Death of Rats"".The actors playing Susanne,Mr. Teatime and Albert were excellent in their portrayals. I found it very enjoyable."
5,The movie that saved Christmas,"I have been tiring of Christmas, no actually dreading it, until I saw this movie. It clearly captured the essence of celebrating a seasonal holiday, from it's pagan roots to it's well intentioned if commercially skewed modern incarnation. Now instead of dreading Christmas I can look forward to Hogswatch. Christopher Lee as Death was wonderful, and Michelle Dockery was a captivating Susan, and I loved Teatimes creepiness in spite of his many detractors in other reviews. Thank you Terry for saving the Holidays for me!"
1,Terry Pratchet is probably crying,"I read the book and it was great. There is so much they didn't put in the movie. I loaned the movie to my a friend, who hadn't read the book, and he was lost. If you haven't read the book you won't understand large pieces of the movie. There are scenes that will be lost to the viewer since they left so much explanation out. If you have read the book you will enjoy some of the movie but, I believe, will be disappointed. Considering it takes up two full dvd's I think they should have put in more of the need to know information."
2,HOGFATHER,"I HAVE TO ADMIT WAS A DIFFERANT KIND OF CHRISTMAS MOVIE, AND I DO LOVE THEM. EVEN THOUGH I WON'T THROW THIS AWAY , I MAY NOT WATCH THIS FORA YEAR OR SO. I CAN NOT SAY I WOULD RECOMEND ANYONE BUYING THIS MOVIE,UNLESS YOU ARE A COLLECTER OF CHRISTMAS MOVIES. I HAVE 6 BOOKS OF CHRISTMAS MOVIES AND THE MOVIE'S I LIKE BEST ARE IN BOOK 1 & 2 AND THISWILL GO INTO BOOK 6. SORRY I DID NOT NLIKE THIS EVEN THOUGH THE REVIEWOF IT ON TV LOOK GOOD."
5,Best christmas movie ever,"Such a weird movie, you can't beat that british humor. Definitely a fun one for the whole family. Does run a little long though, so be aware."
4,Fun twist on Christmas and the Grim Reaper,An amusing twist on the origin of Christmas and the mythical powers behind the things we believe in. Lots of humor and great background effects. How much fun it was to have the Grim Reaper in a Christmas story. A++++
4,What a joke,I am writing in the hopes that others will agree with me that Prue (Shannen Doherty) never really died in the last episode because if everyone saw the episode on the dvd set they would have seen the demonic assassin attack prue and piper and thats where it ended. And when I saw the season finale on TV it showed that part and then some. It showed prue die in the last episode or actually i belive it was a 2 part season finale. and then coming to the 4th season it does'nt even recap on how she died (Even though most of us know) I just feel it's wrong for them to cut the BEST season finale of the series. and that if we are going to buy the series set then we should be able so see EVERY episode.
3,What happened to Prue??,"Im from England so maybe they just didn't air her final episode for one reason or another, but i would like to know, what happened to Prue? At the end of one episode, the wind like demon had knocked prue and piper through a wall and they were unconcious whilst pheobe was in the underground with Cole. Please can someone tell me? I can buy the boxset til November and would love to know! Please email me (...)Thank you so much!!"
3,Brand new as advertised.,"dont really know what to say on a review for a dvd other than it came new as said, un-scratcted. seem like everything is fine."
4,Shannen's last season,"Great image quality, not the same for the audio, it's too low!Besides I was hoping for subtitles in english (close caption) but it does not bring those, only audio options for english or french.The rest is cool."
4,The Charmed ones continue to deepen their skills and our interest,"I've been hooked on this series since I realized it existed, although i do admit to some initial doubt. This is a nice blend of the fantastic, and the interesting as the Halliwell sisters come to terms with their ""gifts"" and the responsibilities of the gifts. The fact that they are good witches is a nice change, and the cleverness both of the demons and issues they have to vanquish, and their own ways of dealing with demons, their lives, and the problems of sisters, relationships and family is fun to watch, always. The third season deepens their skills, and will further reel you into their world, if you are not there already."
4,"If you like George, than you'll like this one!!",My kids (ages 2 & 4) and I really enjoy watching Curious George. I think it is very educational and fun way to learn.
1,"Where is my review on this book, seems to have gone funny that??????","I was really hoping for better with the female lead starting off with her being strong, then she ended up being so simpering licking of the boot bad. Letting him get away with having a mistress and him caressing the mistress in front of the whole castle, and the mistress walking around as if she owns the castle. Then finally he realises that if she had a lover he would feel really bad, and she thanks him, what!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I really need to read a book where the female lead doesn't take crap from the male lead, so many books, start good, the whole book contains stuff he does to her to make her miserable, and in the last couple of pages he says sorry/mostly not even that, she just says it's okay and that's it. So if you want a wimpy story this is for you, if not don't read, it just gets the angst going."
1,it sucked,i thought this cd was really disappointing it songs played so slow i started to cry i could believe i bought such a piece of crap it didn't even sound like the same songs i loved for years you should tell people that it sounds like shit before they get stuck with it cause it's cheaper to keep it then send it back i just ordered another one and was very pleased with it
4,Family life situation,Jesse Landow's heart attack changes all the family members and their relationships with each other.
2,High-Price for an Unreliable Product,"Crashes unrecoverably during approximately 40% of the attempts to record two hour movies. This happens on both my XP and ME systems. Pinnacle has been unable to fix this, and their bulletin board confirms that this is a common problem. Good features available when it works."
4,A Very Interesting Book,"Not only did I read this book to satisfy my thirst for trivia, but also, to be enlightened on the more strange and mysterious rituals and practices of different religions. Although the cover says '..of the World's Religions', I personally think that this book focuses more on Christianity. But still, this book is very, very interesting -for me- because the author describes in colorful detail every information he has about a subject.Even though I really like this book, I rate it 4 stars only because sometimes, the explanations are long and somewhat irrelevant. I still recommend it to others, though!"
4,Another one to add to the collection,I've always enjoyed Charles Panati books and this one is no exception.
4,Fun!,"This is a great and fun toy. Note to parents....kind of tough to store, only because tent doesn't stay folded to well. I suppose you could use lots of paper clips or something, but kind of a pain. My son loves it though!"
4,strong documentary,"Too many documentaries about pre-colonial empires cover the same superficial topics. I found this work refreshing and recommend it for individual viewers as well as classrooms.The work avoids implying that the Inca were all-powerful. It stated that their reign was slightly a century. It includes that Incas took ideas from people who lived in Peru before them. The work speaks of peoples called the Nazca and Mache too.Although the work concludes with the decimation of the Inca by Pissarro, this is not the focus of the work as it is with many pre-colonial documentaries. The work spoke about crop circles and terraces and irrigation and many other issues.Too many documentaries have cheesy reenactments. This work presents modern Inca performing ancient rituals. It admits to taking clips from a Hollywood film called ""Royal Hunt of the Sun."" The outfits were so colorful and different from modern garb that it is visually pleasing.Again, thumbs up and well done1"
4,Family Fun,"Our family really likes this game. It helps your kids see another side of their parents!! It makes you laugh, and the songs are good."
5,I seriously want this!!!!,"I love this, and I seriously want this !!!!It's educational, and I, of course will have fun with her!!!She is so pretty!!And she looks so sweet!!!Of course a 6 month old swallowed it....it says 'Not for children under 3' Let alone 6 MONTHS!Thats why the instructions are there.You can't exactly blame Mattel for this can't you? She is the GREATEST toy I've ever seen!!Even though don't have it, I know buy heart little girls will spend loads of hours with it!!Hope this Helpes!!Barbie Fan"
1,"A very poor kit, not worth the money.","To start with, the description of this kit is false. There are NOT 75 pieces... only 11. The detail is VERY, VERY poor... large soft-edged raised blocks with only the vaguest resemblance to the Death Star as seen in the films. You'd honestly be better off starting with a smooth plastic ball & making a Death Star from scratch, rather than buying this kit."
2,Not As Good As In The Movies,"I bought this model while on vacation once and when I started working on it after I got home I realized I kind of wasted my money; that this was a bad impulse buy. The problem is that while the Death Star looks soooooo impresive on the screen, even on TV, but as a model it's just a big round ball. Big whoop...Okay, it might be nice for somebody just starting out in modelling as it has few parts, but for an advanced modeller or even someone with moderate modelling skills, this is a waste of time and money. 'Sorry.'Ron"
5,"Works great, and was easy to find.","This battery works great, was easy to find through Amazon, and ended up being cheaper than what I'd pay at some specialty shops in town. What more could be reasonably asked for?"
4,Stop The Canibus Hate,"Why do people hate on Canibus? Why do people say LL ate him in the battle? I don't know why. Canbius is one of the best MC's to touch the mic. Canibus offers his fifth LP, Rip the Jacker. The album takes a while to get into just like his other LPs. The production is done by Stoupe of Jedi Mind Tricks. The beats have a Latin/Egyptian feel to it. Canibus just spits hard all over him. Tracks that are good are ""Poet Lauerete II"", ""M Sea Cresy"", ""Cinematics"", ""Psych Evaluation"", ""No Return"", & ""Genabius"". The other tracks to me are average or just plain boring. But it's Bis's lyrics that keep the album from being a huge let down. The man is intelligent. The album is 11 tracks long (short and sweet). Let's hope this is not his last one."
5,Amazing...,"The amazing lyrical display listeners of Canibus have come to know and love coupled with some fine production make this Cani's best release to date. Without a doubt this man is on the right track. It seems once Canibus decided to forgo his battle style and completely disregarded the urge to make commercially acceptable music, he suddenly rose to the the top of his game. Get this and Mic Club, they are both masterpieces."
4,His best!,"By far his best album ever. I have never really liked his older cd's, but after hearing this one, I am glad I spent tha money on it. I gave it a 4 only because on a few tracks, he doesnt do the best job rapping to the beats, but the songs are still great. I have learned either you love his voice, or can't stand it. His style differs so much from everyone else that adds alot to his skills. Defently a buy, and with the guy ( whats his name? ) from Jedi Mind making the beats, wow, a must buy!"
4,across a moonlit sea,"enjoyed the book, was glad the lady finally tried to act like a lady instead of a man sailor. all in all I rally liked the book"
5,Reader,"This is a book of high adventure and romance. I loved every word of it. I could envision the ships at sea, the battles and the wonderful rich characters written into this story. It was not lacking in any way. The only problem was my impatience to see what was going to happen next. This author writes a story to appease the romantic readers interest, but yet there is a story being told that would would stand alone without the romance."
1,Look for something else,Product came with no instructions and no help files. I was able to convert 1 DVD successfully. Another one had problems with the audio/video sync. All of the other DVDs I tried encountered errors during the load and the application crashed. Don't waste your money on this!
1,Don't waste your money,"This software claims to do amazing things and have great customer support. The fact is the software is slow, doesn't work on DVD's longer than 2 hours and the customer support doesn't exist. I have sent multiple emails to their support team, which claims 24 hour turnaround, and to this day have received no help. Stay far away from these guys."
2,It's okay...,"So I thought this was the savior for my issues. Yes it works, but doesn't break up the video on your iPod as tracks. The sound on some of the videos come out a bit distorted but u gotta change the settings till u get it right. Bad thing is that u won't know until the job gets done, a couple a hours later. They don't even send u a manual or somm to help you set the thing up properly.It's aight."
3,Dark Horse Stationary,I love skulls so this vamp theme stationary works for my personality. Paper is a little too dark and hard to read writting on though
4,"Good, not great.","I have owned this cd for many years and I enjoy a lot of the tracks on here.Its flow is a little bit ackward, 93 returning mix is amazing when used correctly however to start with it, seemed a bit, well bad. It just doesn't flow well to use as an intro track. I will say its the only real downfall to this CD. It has some good track selection and the live feeling makes it that much better.Ferry knows how to make a place enjoy his mixing, this CD will do its best to bring you to that experience without actually going."
5,One of the better Live CDs for Ferry Corsten,"Great Live recording of Ferry Corsten at Club Giant in Los Angeles. Some of the tracks are great and you can hear the energy of the people and place. Also highly recommended is Tall Paul Live @ Giant, another great one."
5,One word: OUTSTANDING,"This is a great CD, and a really great follow up to their s/t release, this band is going places. My favorite tracks are: ""Choose Life"", ""What's New"", ""Why"", ""Skungle"", ""Legal Shot Pam Pam"" (That's right, the old Toasters song), and ""My Time Now"". Actually, I'd put every song on the CD up there if I could do that, but I can't. If you want typical ska/punk/hardcore, don't buy this CD, if you want good music, buy it, and listen to it everyday like I do.And if you think their CD is good, you have to see them live, they are the GREATEST thing to ever hit the stage."
5,Evolution of western music,"How many times do you wish you could get the music or sound track from programs? Well here, it is all the music from Howard Goodall's Big Bang's.He made a great selection and it all fits the theme he is putting forward in the TV program of the purpose is to explore five turning-points in the history of western classical music, and his book ""Big Bangs: Five Musical Revolutions."" There are nineteen tracks in all."
5,More Gripping than Titanic!,"Snappy, riveting and well-written. Really pulls you in to the saga of the survivors on the open water. A great sea tale."
5,very pleased,i have used this commercially in a childs gym and play center for about 3 years. they have bags but i do not use one and don't have a problem. the filter twists off and i have gently banged it clean and put it back on. i do need a new filter which brought me to this listing. we vac a lot of dust and dust bunnies. nothing ever gets clogged and the capacity is very large. it is easy empty and has very good suction. it works on carpet but i wouldnt suggest it if you have a lot of carpet. we use a dyson for our carpeted areas. i would buy another one when this one is done.
4,A great book for die-hard Bundy fans and newbies alike.,"A splendid collection including some of the greatest one-liners from the show's eleven years. There's a good sense of completeness, and all the major characters and situations are featured. Topped-off with a couple of serious series quotes, it is an enjoyable book and a great tribute to ""Married... with Children""."
5,"Great Product, Delayed Shipping","I bought the complete collection of Yes Minister from MovieMars for my brother's birthday. While the show itself is amazing, it took over two weeks for the package to arrive. Luckily, I ordered early. I believe the problem was that it was originally shipped from DHL, and then it was delayed when it transferred to USPS. The packing was great, but the timing was poor. I do not recommend buying from MovieMars; just choose another seller."
3,Milage may vary,"My beard hairs are thick and dull razors quickly, and I sometimes get a lot of ingrown hairs, which leave bumps and then darken my skin(white/easily tanned) for a while, so I thought I'd give this a shot. I followed all directions. A test patch worked ok, but when using for real it hurt my face, giving me a little rash for a couple of days, and only removed a small portion of stubble. It worked great for a test patch of body hair and didn't hurt my ears either. It might be really good for swimmers and bikers during race prep, but be cautious!"
4,Selling and buying property that we never owned,"This book coupled with American Nations gives a real good look at how the American continent, our politics and trade practices were formed."
5,Measuring America,A very nice read. Well organized and historically great. Anyone who deals with measurements (I'm a surveyor) should read this book.
5,So comfortable,"The color, the fit, everything in short, was exactly what was promised. Grasshoppers are the most comfortable shoes I have found in a very long time. They were shipped as promised, also."
1,rival 5 quart crock pot,"The crock pot cooked two roasts in 4 hours on low! When you lift the lid whatever you're cooking is boiling rapidly. To make matters worse, the lid is too small for the pot. I tried it two more times and all you can hear is the lid rattling. I wanted to talk to someone at Rivel but there isn't any phone number on the box."
1,Way too hot!!!,"I bought this a couple years ago for $12 at a Black Friday sale at Lowes. I thought it seemed like a good deal, well you get what you pay for I guess! You cannot put any meat in this and set it to low for all day cooking, if you do you will get something that resembles shoe leather! It is just too darn hot! I am going to try cooking on the warm setting, if that doesn't work this thing is going into the dumpster!"
1,"Burns Food, Even on Low","You put a lot of work into preparing the food. You put it in the Crock-Pot and come back and the sides are burned and the food dried out. ON LOW!!)My guess: someone sued, saying their food made them sick. The company's answer: burn the food, so we can testify that it's not possible.DON'T BUY A CROCKPOT."
1,Chronicly burns food,"It cooks way to fast and way to hot, even on the low setting it scortches food. It would only be OK if you were going to be right there standing over it watching it."
2,Bought a replacement at Goodwill.,"This slow cooker cooks too fast--it's almost like a big electric skillet. I thought I needed a new crock pot, so bought this and got rid of my old one. This cooks so fast, I wouldn't consider putting food in it and leaving it all day while I'm at work. It works ok if I'm planning to be home for 2-4 hours, but not for 8-12 hours at all. My Mom bought another brand of slow cooker and it did the same thing, so maybe it's a new device to protect us from food poisoning if the food cooks too low or something.I ended up going to Goodwill and buying an old one to replace it. The good news is that at Goodwill the replacement was only $5."
3,"Good, however","This is a large sized pot. It works well for heating soups, stews and the like, but I think it could get a little hotter."
2,6.5 Quart slow cooker,This is a nice slow cooker but it is rather awkward to handle for a small person. It is quite heavy and the handle on the crockery part is too short to get a good grip. It also gets very hot on the outside. A child could get burned...so could an adult. The little dipper was a nice bonus but it doesn't have a temperature control. The little dipper crockery does not separate from the outside and it is tricky to wash. I'm surprised that Rival put their name on this set. Their products are usually of higher quality.
1,Horrible,"I bought this for my daughter (age 11) and she likes it, but this is ridiculously bad. The acting, the writing, sets, you name it.Just terrible. Save your money."
2,Rock Review-,They were quiet a bit smaller than I thought and I also was hoping for bigger more smoother river rock looking as the advertisment 'implied'.
5,What a delightful surprise!,"We read this book merely as an ""easy-reader"" for homeschool. What a delightful book! As my young daughter read aloud, the rest of us became distracted with amusement. Her stiltedness as a new reader gave the same effect as a ""Dragnet"" voice...a must for future reading of Nate stories. I am so impressed with the author's skill at using so few words to generate so much humor and mystery. It just hits the bullseye by captivating the kids and tickling the funny bone of the parents, as well.The storyline is a young child detective who loves pancakes. His observations of the obvious are the source of most laughs and his observation of the not-so-obvious (at least to the young reader) are the source of the mystery.A+ in Reading!"
3,Hazel fails to clean again,She is painful to watch - but the DVD is great!!! A classic tv show - but give me ALICE!
5,A WONDERFUL BOOK,"Relatively few works are likely to concretely impact the quality of our everyday life. According to my opinion, and based on the experiment which I made of the practical tools described in this book, this one is one of them.Do not mislead you there, this work has nothing to do with the majority of the ""doubtful"" works devoted to breathing.In short, this remarkable book is a great classic, you will understand quickly why. I sincerely wish you to discover it soon."
5,Very cool and very useful,"We bought one of these as a birthday present for my mom, and one to keep for ourselves. With an appropriate-shaped teapot (we found one at Cost Plus World Market for ten bucks, although it's probably 20% smaller than optimal), one can keep tea drinkably warm for a couple of hours. It's always a conversation-starter when we have friends over.Highly recommended!"
2,Don't answer the bell in Round 3,"I own all three Fight Nights and they almost seem to digress. I loved the first one, but I hated the announcer, so having a fairly sophisticated announcer in the Round 2 was a welcomed change.All of the ""upgrades"" in Round 3 are disappointing. Sometimes you swing and miss, and your boxer is just frozen there to be punched for 3 seconds (I don't know what is with that). Before some of the fights you have to ""weigh in"". Fights break out but you can not punch, so it just becomes a chance to block while your opponent drills you. The announcer says the same thing every fight.When it comes down to it, Round 3 is still a good game but it is not quite as good as the first two fight nights. The graphics for Round 3 on 360 are incredible, but they are no better than Round 2. If you do not have a 360, save your money until you do."
5,Great Movie,Norman Mailer's genius shines through with every scene. Very entertaining and plenty of black humour.
2,This should be called electric variable speed drive,"This should be called electric variable speed drive because it has a very poor coverage for the mechanical variable speed drives.I guess it is the author's own background is limited to the electric field otherwise he won't be so innocent of rich field of the mechanical variable speed drives:the epicyclic gearsets, the differentials, the linkages, the geneva mechanism, and so on.You should know what you don't know!"
1,Worst Programming Book of the Past Two Centuries,"The previous reviewer, Mr. Chapel, sounds like he was in the same class that I also dropped for the same reason. This book appears to have been tossed together by someone who had an unreasonably short deadline to meet so that the publisher could have something with the right title on the market quickly.It is absolutely the worst programming/engineering book that I have ever had foisted on me, and I've read or seen thousands. In addition to being disorganized and unclear, it had some obvious errors in it. Even the instructor stated that he could not do one of the problems he gave the class as a homework assignment as shown in the book. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. I found alternative sources to learn material in this book, e.g, Deitel, Troelsen, and Otey.I've seen a number of Thomson software books, and have never been particularly impressed by them. But this book hovers between undecipherable and fraudulent."
5,One of the great Spanish Hebrew poets,A leading poet of the medieval Spanish Hebrew poets he was also a theoretician. Born in Granada he for over forty years wandered a poor exile. T.Carmi the foremost expert on Hebrew poetry in our generation says that his 'shorter meditative pieces and sensual love poems are compact and beautiful'.I have found some of his short poems striking and memorable.
3,works half the time,"I want to like this record. The music is great, and I probably prefer this to the over-praised New Forms. However, I can't shake the feeling that I would have liked it better if there were no vocals at all. I'll give Leonie Laws credit -- these are some of the least cheesy drum & bass vocals I've heard (she seems to be aiming for a portishead/ruby/garbage type attitude), but they still don't always work. A lot of times she goes for a staccato sing. a. long. with. the. bass. line. style that gets old very quickly. I wish someone would put out a solid drum & bass project like this with RAPPING instead of singing..."
4,An enjoyable read,"This book is great. Break out the magnifying glass, some of the printing is really small. My only complaint is the house plans are from people mostly on the east coast, so they don't quite fit what people from the west coast would call ""Bungalows"". There's really only 1 plan in there that looks like a California bungalow. But, the book is full of creative plans that would be very comfortable small homes."
3,Slightly difficult to read,"The sketches and floor plans are a little hard to read by modern standards, as all are hand-lettered, and the designs are a little light on bathrooms, to say nothing of garages, compared to contemporary homes. But the homes are very Picturesque nonetheless, featuring plenty of faux thatched roofs, chimneys, eyebrow dormers, arched entryways, porches and so forth."
1,Don't waste your money,"Wish I had believed the other poor reviews of this hammock and kept looking.I wanted a one-person replacement hammock, to fit my metal hammock stand.This does fit, which is the only positive I can give it.This hammock is VERY cheaply made--the cotton rope it's made of is flimsy and thin. I seriously doubt it would hold up for even one season.And, even worse, this thin rope stretches like crazy. So no matter how tightly I hung the hammock on the stand, it sagged so badly that it was difficult to get out of.My old cotton hammock was of much better quality cotton rope. Maybe I'll just buy some lengths of clothesline and re-string it. Anything would be better than this Padre Island Hammock."
3,He was HOW OLD?,"I liked this book. Like the previous reviewer said, it was a fast fun read - at times unbelievable - but interesting. OK, here is my issue. In the book she has a friend Hamp. Hamp dies shortly after looking at the photograph someone took of him with balls of light forming the year 1967 above his head, which turns out to be his year of birth according to the author. Per the timeline she purchased the house in 1980, and Hamp passed the second year she lived there. SO - do the math - Hamp was 15 years OLD? Understand that in the book this character is detailed as an imposing but gentle giant of a MAN that is a very close friend and spiritual advisor to her, but based on her dates he was a kid. Anyway. This and a few other seeming falsehoods in the book do stand out, but overall it is well written and entertaining. I feel very sorry for all she had to endure at the hands of her husband though. Such a jerk!"
3,Disappointing Ending,This book was really good until about three quarters of the way through when it just seemed to get very unrealistically dramatic. Its almost like the ending wasn't written by the same person. I was very disappointed as the beginning was very believable.
5,I loved it,"Lyke the first review said about them not being the Owners, weather or not they have in the past I dunno.. But wot I do know is that this bbook was awsome... Kermeen wrote it with such beautiful detail, making the reader feel part of the story... reading it made Me feel as if I was there seeing, hearing, and feeling all that she spoke of... I loved it and would recomend it to anyone that loves ""Ghost Stories""...."
1,A Meaty Haunting Narrative,"Ms. Kermeen has delivered a very well-written book and if you take her experiences at the Myrtles plantation seriously, they are very scary indeed. But I must confess, when I got to about page 200 I had to set this book aside because that's about where it turns plainly ridiculous. I am not debunking the paranormal occurrences that have made Myrtles famous, but before you buy this book check out Troy Taylor's, ""Legends, Lore and Lies of the Myrtles Plantation,"" available for free through a Google search. That ""meaty"" taste that haunts you after reading books like this? It's pure baloney."
5,A perfect kitchen appliance,"Guess I was lucky; many reviewers are dissatisfied with this Sharp microwave, but I have not had a hitch. I have had mine for close to six months and I have not had a single mishap. The oven is easy to use and program. And it's a cinch to clean. That second reason is very important to me. And, given the price, it's a hat trick!"
1,Loved it BUT .... only for a few months,Originally I owned a Sharp Carousel Microwave and loved it. It went south after several years and was going to replace w/ another Sharp unit BUT was warned off due to reading reviews on-line. Bought a Panasonic and hated it! Poor functionally (burned food and uneven heating) and lack of programming (ease and number of options). Gave to Goodwill.Purchased this unit and LOVED it but it blew a circuit breaker day before yesterday while cooking (unit is only 3 mos. old) and noticed an electrical smell yesterday before hearing popping and crackling sounds. Have contacted Sharp and they heave recommended a repair shop. Is it worth taking it in? May keep as a spare and purchase a Kenmore and keep fingers crossed.I feel that I should not have to do a ton of research on a product one uses daily.
1,"Wonderful Vocals, Poor Video","The quality of the vocals on these discs is superb, probably the greatest recording i've heard of this opera, and one of the best Handel recordings ever. Unfortunately the staging by David McVicars is absured in places and frequently embarassing. The greatest flaw is the poor quality of the video. I have returned two sets so I am assuming they all are of poor quality. I saw this opera in the theater recently and the filming was clear and crisp. The dvd's have poor lighting, vibrating diagonal lines and frequently snowy images."
4,It's Been (Sur)Real!,"This collection of short stories turns a lot of conventions on its head by ignoring them. The Doctor from the two movies staring Peter Cushing is just as real as the others. The Ninth Doctor has a history. The Fourth Doctor and Romana have a thing going on. The Doctor can be presented as a parody of himself. The wildly separated stories present views not only of the Doctor from television, but the Doctor from the future and parallel Doctors. There are enough views of all the different Doctors that not every story will be equally enjoyable to all people. (Thus four rather than five stars.) However, every long-term fan of Doctor Who will find enough in this book to hold their attention and keep them coming back for more. It's worth getting. Just bear in mind that you'll be disappointed a few times."
2,Another ghost-written Johnstone of poor quality,"I like the real william Johnstone books for escapist action fiction; this is one published after his death presumably written by him with J.A. Johnstone. It is ghost-written, nowhere near Johnstone's work and is a rip-off by his estate trying to maximize his 'brand name' and selling what I view as counterfeits. overall--it is ho-hum, more of the s.o.s. without the quality or stamp of the real Johnstone. Not sure if he'd turn over in his grave or chuckle at the suckers buying it and contributing to his estate."
3,flaps are too small and difficult to open,"the flaps in this book are small and difficult to open at first. Once I opened them for my son he can flap them open now too, but they are so small and there are so many on a page that it is a bit overwhelming and he doesn't really care too much for it. The only thing that draws him to it is the fact that it is thomas the train. Otherwise, he doesn't really use the flaps too much."
5,3 yr old boy loves this Thomas Book,"I purchased this book a few weeks ago for my son's 3rd birthday. He really likes it. He's always liked the books with flaps. I've seen him pick up this book on multiple occasions and start ""reading"" it himself. Plus he's a big fan of trains. I'm happy with this purchase."
5,Lots of flaps = Lots of fun,"My husband bought this for our son when he was 19 mos or so. He is going to turn 2 soon and he still loves that book. He loves to look under the flaps, and has actually learned a lot from it. He never knew what a kangaroo was until he got this book. I was amazed at his ability to recall what flap the kangaroo was under! It's a bright, colorful book that any toddler will enjoy, especially if they are Thomas fans.The only downside I would say about this book is that some of the flaps are not as strong as others. My toddler has ripped off a few of them, but mostly because he is so enthusiastic about the book!"
3,interpersonal living,"This introduction to a group-centred training program emphasizes systematic learning of basic interpersonal skills, as well as skills needed to become an effective communicator and group member. Contains topics on the basic concepts of the human-relation-training laboratory, the skill of self-disclosure, the skills of listening and responding, the skills of challenging, and, the skills of effective group participation among others.Tony, Irags"
5,ASCENSION 4-2000,THIS ALBUM MADE ME LAUGH OUT LOUD AND CRY AND SMILE. I THINK THAT THIS ALBUM IS SOMETHING THAT A PERSON THAT IS GOING THOUGH ALOT OF DRAMA CAN RELATE TO THIS ALBUM. HE HAS MANY DIFFRENT STYLE AND I LIKE THAT BECAUSE ALOT OF ALBUMS ALL THE SONGS SOUND THE SAME AND THEY DON'T CHANGE THEIR VOICE. THE ASCENSION 4-2000 IS ONE OF REALEST ALBUM'S I HAVE HEARD IN A LONG TIME CHECK IT OUT.
4,A GOOD BUY FOR THE MONEY,"I am very satisfied with the phone and answer machine. It was simple to program and functions well. The contemporary style is eye catching. All in all, I believe it is a good deal considering the low cost for a phone/answer machine combo."
1,Disappointed,I have had to exchange this item on three different occasions and it still doesn't work. I finally decided to just forget it and take the loss.
1,Not a Victory,"I bought this CD based on the info provided stating that it was the sound track from the video. I missed the fact that is ""selection"" of tracks and that some have new arrangements. If you want the entire, unmodified Victory At Sea sound track, do not buy this CD."
3,A few good pieces missing,"I have a 2-audiotape set with 3 additional pieces that are sadly missing here. Magnetic North so well portrays the cold and harsh war in the Aleutian Islands as it was presented in the TV series. It always raises goose bumps at its haunting conclusion with strings emulating the artic winds. Mediterranean Mosaic and Mare Nostrum are 2 others that I would have preferred over the Symphonic Suite, which I have never heard on 2 different audio tape versions or a 33 1/3 vinyl set."
2,"I love Diana Rigg and George C. Scott as actors, but...","This is not a really good film. Funny in parts, and really shows stuff of the late 60's and early 70's that I can relate to, but a real weak plot. I watched the whole thing and it was just not a very good movie from beginning to end."
4,Want to be a doctor? Want to be a Nurse? Watch this movie!,"Ahead of its time in 1971 and even more appropriate today, this movie is a must see for any wide eyed angle a mercy thinking of going into medicine. Brave also, it forsaw the shallowness of 60's culture that we are paying for now. Scott gives a great performance as an administrator/doctor, but it is Dianna Rigg's monologue that foreshadows today's ""poor rich kids"" and what money and no love will do. That is why you don't see THIS counter-culture film on college campuses."
5,"Surprised, great movie.",I really really enjoyed this movie. I was so impressed by Mariah's acting...and the story was really touching and moving. I definitely shed a number of tears... The filming is really lovely...and I just love the Tennessee landscape. Just beautiful! It's worth a watch...I'm very happy I stumbled across this movie unexpectedly.
2,Jesus Only Churches,"This book was mainly a deceptive one. It's main point was to condemn others, while failing to use Scriptural methods to justify these critical attacks. Instead they relied on traditions (much like they accuse the Catholics of) instead of truth, especially in the baptism issues. It's recycled rhetoric and not much else. Not recommended at all."
1,Booklet fails in this purpose,"The back cover of Beisner's booklet promises to vide ""essential and liable information and fights"" on Oneness Pentecostalism. Unfortunatethe booklet fails in this purpose and actually cres significant obstacles for understanding and communication. The antagonistice prejudicial tone does not foster dialogue, much of the inforation is simply wrong, the presentation of Oneness Pentecostal doctrinal views is seriously flawed, and the presentation of historic, ""orthodox understanding"" is surprisingly narrow and controversial. What I find too strange is how can a respectful publisher like Zondervan allow a very poor work like this to be published under its name. For a complete response and refutation to this booklet go to http://www.altupc.com/articles/chresp.htm"
1,Confused,"What can you do with a piece of latex that is 5 inches by five point five inches? Look at this presentation page. More than half the references to size say 5"" x 5.5"". Anyone proof read anymore?"
3,a little bit short,Everything is great about this product except one thing. It is shorter than what I used to work with. I can not do some of my workouts because of its shortness. If you want to buy this product just make sure that the length is enough for you.
1,Snapped on 1st use,I have been using Thera ands in PT for a while. The yellow band broke on first use. I have not taken the other colors out of the package yet. I do not believe that the product was of the quality used in therapy.
3,whoops,"While the music and presentation is wonderful, the quality of what looks like a transfer from VCR is horrible.I've seen bootlegs with much better visual quality."
3,No SSE,"Not a bad book for an introduction to linux assemly. However if you are looking for floating point or SSE and SSE2 related material then I recommend going to Intels web site and downloading the material. All in all not a bad book, but it was kinda skimpy. Not enough meat to satisfy the taste buds."
3,Missing Liner Notes,"Beautiful performance and recording of the Saint-Saens. Amazon's stock of this is missing the liner notes however (it has an insert explaining what an sacd is, but that's it). After explaining the problem to their customer service, Amazon was quick to send me a replacement, and it too was missing the documentation. Worth getting, but get it from somewhere else."
4,Presuming you have the time...,"As a book on reading, I find it ironic how un-reader friendly the layout and structure of the text is; the second chapter alone is 70 pages and laid out terribly. That said, I've never seen an educator so seamlessly connect literary theory, educational philosophy and classroom practice: if you're willing to invest the time to slough through the chapters, you'll find brilliant and extremely usable activities to use in the literature classroom, done in the ideological context we all want to manifest You will not be able to skim this book (the layout makes it impossible), but you will be enlightened when reading it--just know that it will take days to do so. If you're a pre-service teacher like myself, I would actually suggest you take a look through it after your student teaching but before you begin your first job...you'll want to be asking the sort of questions the text demands, just not when you're trying to keep your life in order."
2,"junk, but fun if it stays working","bought for my 3 year old son. he absolutely loved it, but toy quickly broke. not durable at all. bought second considering that 1st could be fluke, but NO, 2nd broke also just after days of use, changed batteries in both trains in front and back, also remote--did nothing. very disappointed, as well as my son :(. not worth the money!!!!!"
1,Much Better ADD Books Than This One,This is a very basic book that doesn't really provide enough detail on anything to offer effective solutions for overcoming chronic distractions. There are many other books that are quick to read with more valuable insight in them.
5,Uncluttered solutions - perfect for an ADD'er,"As a woman with ADD, with two sons who have ADD, I can use all of the help I can get. The book was very straightforward. I liked it because there was not a lot of extra material to wade through mentally. ADD'ers need quick, succinct, solid solutions. This is a great book for newly diagnosed for Adults with ADD who have a lot on their plate.."
5,I was impressed,"I will start by saying this is a very Dark sci-fi Anime I strongly think is was done very well The animation was done in away that just about takes your breath away. The Action is very Violent and very Enjoyable yes there is some blood/gore and yes there is some ""Fan Service"" but all that plays well into the series if your like me you may get confused in the first two to three episodes as to who the Protagonist is but as the series moves it dose go deep into each of the main Hero's story and back story and ties them all together for a showdown in the end that is rather shocking.I do strongly recommend this to all Action Anime and Sci-fi Anime fans you wont be disappointed."
4,A MUST READ FOR ALL TEACHER CANDIDATES AND NEW TEACHERS!,"At under $15(CAN), this is 176 pages of gold. It is a short but invaluable read! It is by far the most useful book I read on why and how students behave or misbehave in the classroom. The lessons taught by Rubenstein's experience will spare you many headaches. Having read it after my first placement as a student teacher I could see many of the mistakes I had made within its pages. Rubenstein comes off as very old school and hard to accept at first. That is until you hit page 81 where the goal of using his modus operandi becomes clear and palatable. I wish I had read it before my first practicum placement. There is no single book that can teach you everything you need to know to succeed in the classroom but this one should be part of your library. Its advice will serve you well."
5,Great book on classroom management!,"This book is one of the few I've seen that is specifically targeted at middle school teachers and their unique classroom management challenges. I bought this book because the author is, like me, a middle school math teacher, but his suggestions are good for any secondary teacher. His suggestions are concrete, and practical - even in a school without ideal students or ideal administrators. Rather than vague suggestions like, ""Have a positive attitude,"" this book talks about specific situations that are likely to arise and how to handle them. Buy this book!"
4,A must-read for any teacher struggling with classroom management!,"To all you teachers who feel like throwing in the towel because of those unruly and seemingly unmanageable students, do NOT despair! There is still hope! In his book, Gary Rubinstein writes candidly about his somewhat disastrous first year of teaching. His hilarious tales of his personal struggles to become an efficient classroom manager took me back to my own difficult first year and gave me new insights into behavior management and discipline in the classroom. This is a quick and engaging read, and I highly recommend it to any classroom teacher who is on the verge of shredding that teaching certificate and heading for the hills! Don't give up! Read this book. It will give you back your courage--and, if nothing else, it will restore your much-needed good sense of humor!"
3,"Fun read, but not a ""disciplinarian ideas"" book.","This book was a good read, but didn't really tell me anything new. The author is very funny and talked about things I definitely related to as a teacher. It just wasn't what I wanted as far as strong ideas for being a good disciplinarian."
3,Kinda disappointed,"I bought this book because I too am a softie disciplinarian. See, I'm not exactly trained in the areas I'm teaching, thus my classroom management skills for the subjects I am teaching are kinda... undesirable. So I bought this book hoping for suggestions as to how to improve, and while this book was very humorous and entertaining, I also saw how much I am not a softie. This guy was really bad. I also don't agree with the whole not smiling thing. That is not a part of my personality, thus the kids would see right through me and it would still create problems, not solve them. I didn't really get any good ideas as to how to improve. I would have been better served checking this book out at the library and reading it just for some positive thinking about my own teaching methods. I like the book, but it wasn't what I expected."
4,A great gift to give for anyone approaching that magic age,"From experience I can say that as a 22 year old, uncertainty is your only certainty especially in today's manic reality. But this book did help bring out the fact that even your failures can play a part in your success. Although it would have been nice of the author to condense his list a bit (how about only 22 for the age)it was interesting to learn facts about well known figures. I was most impressed with the decisions of Johnny Cash, Dr. Seuss & heck even Pam Anderson. A few choices felt stretched but overall I would recommend this book to the twenty-something crowed in need of a moral boost and those in their post twenties as a way to reflect."
2,"interesting title, but..","there's really not much that you can say about 100 people at 22, especially when some of the 100 are NOT at the turning point in their lives at 22. At least that is the impression I got after reading this book."
5,Spade Cooley lovers love it,"If you are a Spade Cooley fan, this one's for you! Sound is very good; several of his best songs are on it."
3,it looks like a home made video,It looks like a cheap home made video and probably it is. There are no teaching methods aplied to the making of the video. My son is really into hip-hop but he didn't like it. Now I need to find a better product. Any recomendations?
5,My daughter's new love <3,My 5-year-old daughter gives this video 5 stars!! I think she would watch it 10 times a day if I let her. It is pretty basic so it seems appropriate for elementary school aged children. It provides exercise AND it's really fun so it seems like the whole package. I am very impressed!
3,"Lyle Lovett, Keb' Mo, Nick Lowe, Billy Bragg and Wilco...","Some very good songs by Lyle Lovett, Keb' Mo, Nick Lowe, Billy Bragg and Wilco. The rest is typical movie music by James Newton Howard. Songs - * * * ; instrumental - *"
4,I want Tony's job !,"Easy read. Interesting, humorous at times and gives a good look at the ""Land Down Under"". Makes me want to book a flight and take off for Australia. This book is another example of why Tony's books are all winners. ""THUMBS UP""."
3,Good but not Horwitz' best,"After reading all Hortwitz' books, I can say that his first is far from his best. Frankly, the Australian outback doesn't offer him enough to go on. It's a whole lotta nothing, although he does his best with what he has. The book would be helped by an amusing sidekick, or at least a more interesting part of the world to visit. That said, it's still a pretty good -- and short -- travelogue of Australia and its people."
3,"Interesting, but have read better","This was an interesting book, but nowhere near as good as the reviews I've read here seemed to indicate. For all of his travels, Horwitz doesn't say much, literally and figuratively. In my opinion, a much better book was Greater Nowhere (1988), by Dave Finkelstein and Jack London. It also is the story of Americans setting out to explore ""the other"" Australia, but its written in a more engaging and informative style, and covers more of the country. If you are interested in the off beat Oz, read it."
2,:-|,Una producción muy mediocre me pareció este disco...pues le falta el ímpetu que los otros discos anteriores tienen. No existe nada en este disco que yo recomendaría y eso desafortunadamente justifica que el grupo ya no exista más. Que desperdicio de talento...
1,Don't Even Buy This Garbage!!!!!!!!!,"This Device that is Supposed to be WIRELESS """" G """" It Is GARBAGE. I own one and I want People to Understand that they Work for about 5 Hookups in the """" G """" Mode. They then Stop Hooking up in the """" G """" Mode.

1,Hard to follow,"I am a secondary education mathematic major and found this book to be horrible. I enjoy math and this book really made me question what I thought I knew. Of course, the prof I had wasn't that great either. If considering this book....pleae reconsider and go with one by Larson. If you're a student, you have no choice.....I'd get Precalculus Demystified by Rhonda Huettenmueller to supplement this. If you have to use it.....good luck!"
2,Not really necessary,"If you've ever held a conversation with another human, you don't need this book."
2,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this book. I thought it would be a fresh perspective on the Asian immigration, but I found the characters and stories to be uninteresting and pretty dull all around. It felt like an attempt at a Canadian version of ""Joy Luck Club"",which I also did not like. Each story felt sloppy and incomplete. I didn't get a sense of life in Canada aside from the fact that it is cold and filled with Caucasians. I much prefer ""Troublemakers and other Saints"" by Christina Chiu for Asian themed short stories."
3,Not Nearly as Good as Perdido,"Perdido Street Station was incredible, so I went into this book with high hopes. Unfortunately, they were to fall.The main character spends a great deal of time not really doing anything, which was frustrating and boring. Though Mieville continues to incorporate some cool fantasy - sci fi stuff into his world, it is not nearly as interesting as that in Perdido Street Station. The end was a real disappointment - I won't ruin it if you decide to read it - and really turned me off to this book.Overall, The Scar did not seem as original, interesting, or dynamic as Perdido Street Station. There is not nearly as much action, and no clear antagonist. Read Perdido Street Station, but I wouldn't bother with this one."
2,Don't mind me. Everyone else seems to love this book.,"I really debated between 1 and 2 stars. However, if you read this book, you'll probably give it a 4 or 5 star. So pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. I think my biggest problem with this novel is my age. (I'm too old and lack the imagination of a 12 year old.) If my main form of entertainment still came in the form of Saturday morning cartoons, I think I would have liked this book. However, when I discovered that one of the characters (actually several of them) had tank treads in the place of legs and feet, I gave up. If you can imagine a world (somewhat industrial and post-apocalyptic) where people have machine parts assembled into their natural corps, well, this may be the best book you ever read.Don't listen to me. I'm just one person. I love fantasy. And I love world building. I just couldn't make this work.Ciao."
4,Transported,"Mieville really transports me when I read his stuff. What a great writer. Very dark, but equally enjoyable."
2,Pulpable fiction,"The problem with Mielville is that he is overmuch in love with EVERY ONE of his ideas and proceeds to stick them all into the same book.In Perdido Street Station he introduced the strange city of New Crobuzon in the world Bas-Lag. Not satisfied with that, Mieville throws in a bird-man (a Garuda), alien Kephri (insectile heads on human bodies), the alien Spider who can violate the laws of time and space, Cactaciae (humanoid cacti), Remade (humans punished by having unhuman biological or mechanical portions joined to them), the evil Slake Moths, and the list goes ever on and on and on.The Scar is similarly fatally marred (scarred!) by Mieville's excesses and self-love. Someday Mieville may find a good and ruthless editor that will raise his work beyond eminently forgettable pulp. For now, he is a disappointment and huge one."
3,"Good, but not as good as Perdido Street Station","While I enjoyed The Scar, I cannot recommend it as heartily as many here have.Yes, China Mieville has a way with words.But I feel he stretched in this outing. The style that lent such depth and texture to Perdido Street Station seems overloaded in The Scar.Yes, he can tell a story.But the ending was flat, and contained what could be considered either a gaping plot hole or just a rather inconsequential end to an interesting character (for those who have read and are wondering, remember the reason why Armada needed its rather unique ""engine"", and the lack of any such engine on a certain character's boat in the end)Anyone who enjoyed Perdido Street Station will enjoy The Scar. Bas Lag is a fabulous world, and one that I hope China Mieville will give us more of. The Scar was good, but after tasting Perdido Street Station, I find this meal vaguely unsatisfying."
2,no sympathy for characters; obscure plot,"the author's ability to describe still remains incredible; but the characters are people that, in the real world, you wouldn't hang around them anyway for even an hour. the main protagonist is a sour individual who gave me a stomachache after a few pages. i found perdido street station much more enjoyable. when i finished the book i was left wondering..""what now?"""
1,stodgy new age gothic...,"Givvus a break, China.I was smothered under your sour and sodden blanket of words.Anyone fancy hardcore gothic then look to the real masters: Jean Genet and Mervyn Peake.That's offbeat..."
4,Limits to Growth reviewed,The book is a very good background to think about key aspects of Earth's future
2,limits to growth CD,I hoped the CD would contain more material but it didn't give me more than reading the book.
1,CRIPS ARE THE HARDEST!,THIS CD IS WEAK. IF YOU WANT TO HEAR REAL GANGSTA MUZICC LISTEN TO THE CRIPS. 187 ON ALL SLOBS CUZZ.
4,Afghanistan,I opened the book on the page that described Afghanistan as having sea ports. Hmmm...since when did land-locked Afghanistan touch the sea?Someone needs to proof-read!
5,A great buy!,I love all the tracks on the cd! Tessa's voice is captivating and exhilarating. I am waiting for the next one!
5,absoloutely wonderfu;,i loved the whole Diadem series so much when i was 10 and i started rereading it again and i still definately adore it even though im now 15. i was so mad when i found that this book was his last book in the series. i really want him to make at least one other book i mean he has to the cover picture still isnt complete. i love these books so much.
1,Don`t buy,"This just doesn`t work, it irritates skin. If you need a similar product, buy a powder and mix with water to make a cream, its much less irritating and much more efficient. I use it all the time, again buy the powder not a cream."
2,Most hair removed but smells bad.,"I tried this product because I have sensitive skin and razors tend to leave bumps on my face and neck. The first time I tried it most of my facial hair was not removed. Plus, it smells like burnt hair after removing the cream. I have tried it three times with similar results. You can not even wash your face hours after using the product because it will burn."
3,Rugby 06,"I like rugby 06 alot. the offloding and the new moves are really good. Butthe players with the stars is what spoils it, because they make it completely unrealistic. For example: Tana Umanga breakes 8 tackles, no player can do that. Well I hope this revieuw helped"
1,Not what I hoped for. . .,"Unfortunately the bike is the perfect size for my son but it does not peddle well, because it has no chain it is very slow to start and difficult for him to manage, he does not like riding it. I wish it came with a push-bar attached to the back because it would work nice as a beginners bike with the option of mom/dad giving a helping push. I don't think I would recommend this to anyone."
3,"Good stand, great price",I have been using thes stand for a month and they very nice stands with very useful feature like the mic lock. They are not heavy duty stand by any stretch. These Stands will last a long time if handle with care and don't over tighten the mic stand clutches. I recommend this product at a $100 it's a great deal.
2,Disappointing,"I was drawn to purchase this CD by hearing one song from it on the radio. Unfortunately many of the ""melodies"" are derivative and remind me of bits and pieces of other things I've heard and I find this distracting. Trio ought to concentate on establishing a more unique sound and either doing standards in a new & refreshing way or coming up with more sparkling new material."
2,One of the first shooters on 3DO,Very touchy control as you just touch it a little and go flying in one direction of another. If you can get a handle on the control the gave is still below average.
1,"What A Horrible, Horrible Movie","Don't bother. I like bad movies but this was just terrible. The acting is a joke. Joyce Hyser in particular hammed it up as a girl pretending to be a guy in order to be a reporter. The movie is riddled with poorly executed cliches and ridiculously improbable behaviors/situations. Sounds good, I know. I normally love 80's movies, but this was just bad. If you really feel a need to watch this, make sure you aren't paying much for it. I regret the $4 I spent on this atrocious film."
4,Just an all-around fun movie,"This is a lighthearted movie that is fun and silly. There are too many ""reality"" movies out there with too much drama these days, especially when they involve teens. This one is cute and just plain relaxing to watch. You can't beat the price for a few hours of entertainment. It brings me back to the days when high school wasn't life-threatening, just involved everyday teen antics. Get the movie (DVD), you won't regret it."
4,Joyce Hyser what a fox,"Just One Of the Guys, is a great 80's movie, no doubt. It has everything, to comedy to being serious. Joyse Hyser should of gotten more lead roles, cause she is a wonderful actress, and very beutiful esp. in the scene were she is wearing the bikini by the pool. I seen the other movies she stared in, and with her talent, Joyce is the one that lights the scene. If you happen to read this review Joyce, I hope you take it to heart, cause you are a great actress, and we should see more of you, in leading roles. Take Care."
2,Too raunchy to be funny,"I bought this movie because I remembered it as being funny when I first saw it as a teenager. Well, it may still be funny to a teen, though highly inappropriate, but as an adult, I found the jokes too disgusting to laugh at. The only redeeming factor is that the actress who pretends to be a boy, actually does a decent job of it. In many other similar movies and TV shows, you sit there thinking, ""Nobody would buy that person as a boy (or girl as the case may be)"". In this movie, she actually looks, acts and sounds like a boy. Otherwise, the movie has no real redeeming value. You can getter better entertainment with much less disgusting content from She's the Man."
2,A so-so Movie,I bought this w/out having ever seen it and now I regret it. I will never watch it again due to the fact that is was BORING to say the least! I love 80's movies but this is no Weird Science/16 Candles/Pretty in Pink. I did not laugh not one time or even smile! And the little horny brother got on my last nerve. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
1,Just One of the Worst,"This was a horribly, cheesy 80's movie. It wasn't funny. There was nothing memorable about it. The dialogue will make you cringe. If you did not grow up in the 80's, just skip this movie. This movie is not worth your time. I forced myself to watch this movie only because Clayton Rohner was in it. He was the only good actor out of the entire movie. He looked hot in a tuxedo. His acting alone wasn't enough to save the movie. Everybody else sounded so fake including Joyce Hyser who made up 90% of the movie. I could not stand Joyce Hyser. It was very hard to empathize with her. She's just a mediocre actress. After a while, I got so sick of her deep boy impersonation voice. So if you don't like her, you won't enjoy the movie. She was only there for eye candy. Save yourself from the horror of bad 80's movies and just go watch Modern Girls or Dirty Dancing instead."
2,Cute movie. Cute girl.,"This is a cute teen movie from the past. I remember really having the hots for Joyce Hyser back in the day. She looks totally hot in her bikini at the beginning and has a great body. I thought she was really good in the part and carries the movie. He brother, who looked like he could be her brother in real life was annoying as hell. The evil blond haired heel from Karate Kid is great as usual as the jock/jerk of the school. And the guy that plays Joyces love interest was always good. It was a cute little film with a cute story and a cute girl. Wish she would have done more."
3,LITTLE KNOWN TEEN MOVIE 4 STARS NEEDS BETTER DVD TREATMENT 2 STARS = 3 STARS,"This is one of the better teen comedies from the 80's. The movie deserves 4 stars, but the fullscreen release makes me give it 3 stars. Joyce Hyser gives an excellent performance in this funny Toosie reversal ""Teen High School"" flick. The entire cast is very good with many familar faces from the times. Hopefully someone will do this film justice with a widescreen special edition."
4,It works,Took longer than I'd hoped (over a month).But it worked and was completely painless... the flat wart on my finger is no more.Will use it again if I get another.
5,MIRACLE PRODUCT!,"I was amazed. It stated that it could take weeks to remove the wart. I had a wart on my finger for 6 years, and just lived with it. Finally I saw this product and said let me try it. Instead of weeks, I used it for 3 days, twice a day, and the wart peeled right off on the third day. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to rid of a wart fast!"
4,compound w maximum strength wart remover gel,Plantar's warts can be incredibly tenacious and hard to get rid of. We've been treating my son's cluster of 13 plantar's warts for 8 weeks- and they are finally pain free and basically just callouses without active wart at this point. This is a good product; but there are really no guarantees with plantar's warts. You have to keep using this product religiously for good results. We used this route because the methods recommended by the podiatrist would have required my son to miss out on season's end of baseball.
3,Leaves a permanent burnt mark on the skin,Leaves a permanent burnt mark on the skin..now i am trying to find a way to remove that burnt mark..damn!!
1,Awful made my warts worse,"This stuff comes in little tube, the cream is clear and sticky. I applied it on my affected area, it burned a little, so I figured it was working, what it was actually doing was irritating my warts which made them bigger, I now have scabs from trying to get rid of what it did. I would suggest using some type of acne cream on your warts instead of this, it may take a long time to to work but it's way better."
3,I enjoyed it but not a keeper,"This one wasn't nearly as good as I'd hoped; I was a little bored at times. I liked the relationship between the protagonists but some of the political/battle stuff went on too long and was boring to me. I think my main criticism of Ms. Hunter's books that I have read is that they tend to be a little overlong, and of course some are just better than others or more appealing to me. I think the best of her books are By Arrangement and The Seducer; check them out."
5,Yoga strap,I use this strap for yoga exercises I learned from Rodney Yee's Daily Yoga CD. This strap is an integral part of some of the exercises.
2,Some Video Restoration Would've Been Nice,"If you've seen previous World Series VHS tapes, then you're not missing anything if you pass up the older Series DVD's because they are merely the tapes put onto DVD. It sure would have been nice if they had ""cleaned up"" footage somehow because I see the same rough spots and ticks, etc that I saw in the VHS tapes when they first came out. Some new or different footage would've been a treat to those of us who have seen the VHS tapes before. Each World Series shows WAY too much fan reaction and crowd shots and the sort while not concentrating on the action afield enough - this must be MLB's way of showing they care about fans (rolling eyes); the 1989 Series film was the worst by far. So if you already have the VHS tapes of your team's World Series appearances, DO NOT get this."
4,You can see me in this DVD,"A&E did a nice job with this DVD. The extra attention given to the 89 series during the quake copies most of the 1989 World Series VHS version. Anyone who rooted for the A's in the last 40 years would enjoy this colllection. The fact that the SF Giants were unable to win any titles during their 50 years in the Bay Area makes it that more special. However my view of this collection does include the fact that I myself can be seen on it. During the 1989 portion, I am standing behind the ""Welcome Back Ricky"" banner clapping my hands. this is the same video from the 1989 World Series Vhs version.I am wesring black sunglasses and have my hat turned around backwards."
5,"A great time watching ""There Goes My Baby""!","What a GREAT movie! I was taken back to an earlier time when we were the future of America. Acting is OK, music is even better. Worth the purchase for the wonderful music alone! A 5 star adventure in my book!"
2,Painful.,The acting is bad and the both the adults and kids in the film are stereotypes and two dimensional. The film aches to be American Graffiti but the plot developments are contrived and the result is just plain awful. I gave it two stars because I like the music and it is fun to look at the period costumes and haircuts.
5,Great Movie,"Fantastic movie. Shared it with my kids. Teaches a little 1960's history, tons of great 1930-1950 old cars, tons of great 50s and 60s music, brings backs lots of memories of old style hamburger joints, cruising, what it was like to be a kid in the 60s and 70s! Last days of High school, and so on. A true story to boot!"
3,Good but..............,"Don't get me wrong this is a good CD with music in the Merseybeat style but to compare it to the Beatles is carrying it way too far. This music is on par with the music of the third tier Merseybeat bands such as the Escorts and the Undertakers. The Merseybeat bands were in three tiers, the first tier was the Beatles and no one else, the second tier was bands like the Searchers, Gerry and the Pacemakers, the Swingin' Blue Jeans, and the Nashville Teens. The third tier consisted of bands such as those I mentioned earlier. Again that does not mean that this is bad but it is what it is. I have and enjoy recordings by the Escorts and the Undertakers but I realize that they never were or could never hope to be the Beatles, as hard as they tried, and this CD is in that category."
2,Duplication,"This book and computer copy are not very useful. The computer pages are exact copies of the book and, in my estimation, waste a lot of paper with blank space. They are not well-designed and are rather boring."
5,Quietly powerful,This is a quietly told love story that is tender and powerful.Set in the mining world of Australia the scenery is beautiful.I recommend watching it.The actors do a fabulous job.Very well delivered.
4,A combination of an IT's tools,"Pros: with O2 Atom Pure, you have Wifi, 2.0 mp camera, WM5, Bluetooth, tri-band network.You can purchase a bluethooth GPS receiver to make the phone become a GPS navigator (with Tomtom 6).the phone can be charged with a usb cable throught a computer.sound is pretty clear.Size is about the size of a Nokia N70.a clear and bright screen.Cons: no speaker phone. it is a hassle to make a phone call (when you are driving...hehe). you have to punch the screen. i dont like doing it.battery life is short. standby time is about 2 days. talking time is not more than 3 hours.2.5mm audio jack. (they should make it 3.5mm)the audio jack is a trash although it is made with FM reception device."
2,Looks good but thats it,"I think boxing would be more funner to do then to play on a game.I did not like.But thats just me, Bc i lent to a friend of mine who really enjoyed it"
2,EA low blows the fans,"If your a fan of Fight Night 1 & 2 then get ready to be disappointed. The game is much easyer then before and you hit ""legendary"" status alot sooner.Also companys like Burger King, a car company and a few others have their logo's all over the game. Infact you can evan have ""The King"" play as your trainer. ESPN has known to use companys ads before but this is ridiculous.Fight Night Round 3 is more of a game you would want to rent."
3,Reliable But Some Problems,"I've owned this for 5 years.Good:Still working. Good black and white prints/copies/faxes. Compact size.Bad:LCD display is hard to read.Color ink heads clogged within the first year so I've used it as a black and white printer ever since. Tried cleaning but it didn't work.Colors aren't good enough for high quality photos. (hence use as B&W;)Printer keeps telling me it is out of ink when it has ink. Have to hit ""resume"" button to continue.No double sided printing."
3,Funny but disappopinting,"This is actually kind of a funny film but as a sequel to the classic series ""Get Smart"" it is really disappointing. I prefer to think of it as a dream and recommend you rent or buy the much better TV movie sequel ""Get Smart Again"" from 1989. This one is missing most of the original cast and it really hurts the film. By contrast, the 1989 TV movie has most of the cast and is a great and worthy sequel. FOX aired a 7 new episodes of Get Smart in 1995 with the original cast also, but these were not as good as the 1989 movie. I wush they would release them on video anyway. If you like Get Smart, see this but definately get ""Get Smart Again!"""
2,"The first few shows were good, then into the comode.","The first 4 or 5 shows were good, but something went away after that. It never really got the edge back. And Amy Sedaris is a one track pony. And she gets old after a while. This just wasn't for me. I returned it."
4,Too Many Best Hits Collections,"That's right! There's Too Many ""Best Hits Collections"" of these guys. Though this one would be my personal favorite if pressed to say so. At last count there were more collections of Hooter songs than original albums issued. That's just plain WAKED. I suggest buying ""zig zag"", ""Nervous Night"" and ""One Way Home"" via the used venue here on amazon. This way you own ALL of the great music & YOU decide what their best hits are for yourself, don't let some record industry suit do it for you."
4,My kids like this,My 3 year old loves Bear in the Big Blue House so this was a welcome book for her. My 7 year old read it (without the LeapPad) and liked it as well.My only problem with it is that LeapStart books are a little flimsy. The spiral part doesn't hold well with frequent use.
2,knockout kings is dissapointing!,"So many people gave this 5 stars. why? the graphics are subpar, and the playability is not very good. If you don't have a playstation 2 yet, don't worry because there is only 1 really 5 star game out for it being SSX. If you have a playstation 2 and are thinking about this game, don't or you'll be sorry."
1,Zero Stars!!! I had to give one star in order to publish this!!!,"My title also says it all. Don't even bother me with this stupidity!!!I never even bought this. The title of their book is deceiving. I thought it was the book in digital form but reading the description saved me from wasting my money and valuable time. I AM A CHRISTIAN and because I know that this is just a story and it doesn't stop me from reading it. This is just a story that was brilliantly thought up. I am an animator and I can tell you that thinking up stories is the hardest thing to do and then to do it in such a way that the description is lively is brilliant.If you want to know what I'm talking about, just buy a Harry Potter book. If you love Sci-Fi/Fantasy, or are an animation major like myself but are too squeamish, just get the first one at the library, you won't be disappointed.I say this because there are too many crazies out their banking on Christians' belief and thinking that true Christians are gullible, we're not!"
2,Doesn't follow the book closely,"I showed this DVD to my 7th grade students after we finished reading the book by Jacqueline Woodson. We took some time to talk about the differences between the book and the mini-series. Many of the students were surprised at some of the key elements from the book that were either left out or changed significantly in the making of the mini-series. For example, the issue of blame for the death of the boys' mother is such a strong feature in the novel but is completely left out of the mini-series. Another example is how the character of Aaron (Charlie's friend) is a bad influence in the book but appears to be a good, helpful friend in the mini-series. It was entertaining but the kids found some of the acting performances to be amateurish. The clothing, slang, and music seemed out-dated despite the fact that the mini-series is only a few years old. Overall, it was useful for a few comparison activities but not much else. Definitely not Spike Lee's best work."
4,Two Elimination Chambers!,The selling point to me was the two elimination chambers I knew the raw one would be good but the smackdown turned out better than I thought. Undertaker winning the smackdown one was kind of a let down to me but I think Him and Edge put on way better matches than Batista and Edge to me anyway. The Randy Orten vs John Cena Match was a classic to me just because Orten was up to his heal tricks The way the match ended got lots of heat. Then the Edge vs Ray was ok considered Ray was hurt but all in all I would recomend it I thought it was a pretty Good Show and a Great way to determine who would wrestle at mania for the Gold
4,2 Chambers was overkill,"I enjoyed the PPV, however, the SmackDown / ECW Chamber match was unnecessary and inferior to the RAW one. Otherwise a good PPV.Also, I was hoping this would be in Anamorphic Widescreen, now that WWE is all HD now."
2,LOUSY,R. L. Stine should improve this story.Not scary at all.I hope there are better stories than this.The scariest I read was'Welcome To The Dead House'.1000 times better than 'Bad Hare Day'.
3,Three Words: Decent but Average,"I think a lot of these Goosebumps plots would have worked better as short stories instead of being padded and stretched into full-length books. Bad Hare Day is a rather overlooked entry in the series, which is kind of unfortunate because the writing here is quality and the characters get some pretty good lines which border on being (dare I say it?) witty. Sadly, the story doesn't live up to its writing and would have benefited immensely from being trimmed down to half the page count. However, its still a decent, predictable romp with ""You Can't Scare Me!-style"" humor/sarcasm. I'd still recommend it, just after you've read some of the more standout books of the series."
3,This hare is no Easter bunny,"Tim loves magic. He wants to be a magician and he loves to entertain his friends with his tricks. Unfortunately his little sister Ginny loves exposing his tricks in front of his friends. His hero is Amaz-O. One day the owner of the magic shop gives him a free ticket to an Amaz-O show. It's late at night so he sneaks out to go. After the show Tim stops by Amaz-O's dressing room. To his big disappointment all the magician says is ""Beat it, punk."" In anger Tim steals Amaz-O's magic kit and makes a run for it.At home he finds that not all magic is trickery. The kit has many surprises for him and his sister.This is an okay story. The plot is okay. Far from being a favourite."
4,"Excellent service, semi-excellent stand!","I love this stand! I have very heavy keyboards that need this kind of support. I ran into a number of issues setting it up, however. The stand was somewhat crooked, the second tier especially. I contacted the company and they sent me a new second tier for free. I was very pleased about that! However, this didn't help the problem. I broke out several protractors and levels but still had an unpleasantly crooked second tier. Eventually I gave up and just took the rubber support band off one side of the tier and that fixed it. It will probably end up eventually scratching my keyboard, though.If this stand was properly aligned then it would have been one of the best purchases of my life. That is the only reason I am giving this 4 stars.The customer service was amazing, however. My complaint was replied to same-day and the replacement part was shipped the next day!"
2,"Good character narration, but a strange story!",I'm surprised that this short novel got such glowing reviews from other customers. I found the story very hard to believe (the girl fathered by Jeru's dad just happening to be in his class in school? ). The voice was good in the novel but I just read as quickly as possible to get through the book.
3,"Not really ""jerky""","I expected the consistency of this product to be more like meat leather, ""jerky"" the way it's made for humans. But it was not.Basically, this is exactly the same product as a regular Yummy Chummie, except a bit more dry. I'll just get regular chummies from now on and leave the bag open to dry them out a bit."
5,SUPERB SERIES -- COULDN'T PUT DOWN EACH BOOK!,"This is an unusually well-written series, with unique characters and a fascinating story line. Isobelle Carmody is a gifted writer. I have read a lot of fantasy/scifi, and often the plots or aspects of the plot are similar from one book to another (find a portal, travel to another world/time, etc). This series is not only creatively different, it is thought-provoking. I could not put down each book in the series, reading late into the night (which I usually avoid doing). I will not recapitulate the plot here, because so many others have done so. I do want to contradict one of the reviewers that was cited on the cover of the second book of the series (Farseekers), who stated that the book was likely more appropriate for adolescent females. I am 45, and I have found this series to be one of my all-time favorites. Order your copy of Obernewtyn today, and set some time aside!"
4,Pretty good game for the price,"This is worth picking up if you're looking for a good cheap boxing game. Just a warning, it does get repetitive, but the gameplay is awesome and the graphics are stunning."
3,A must own for boxing fans.,This is game that is a must own for boxing fans! Its the best around. It has its tough moments but overall its just a good game. Its one of EA's best titles on the market.
3,It is only OK,"I really was excited about getting this toy for my son and as soon as he opened it, we started putting it together. It was relatively easy to put together but the problems started almost immediately thereafter.1) One of the slots had lots of dead spots and the car just wouldn't run more than a few feet at a time.2) The other slot seemed OK, but it still took several attempts before the car would go all the way around the track.3) The wires for the controllers are very short and we had some issues tripping over them and having them interfere with the cars.4) After playing with it for an hour, we were both fed up - it just was too difficult to make it work right.I have put it back in the box and am frustrated!"
4,LeapPad cd's,"I purchased this program for my granddaughter. She acquired a LeapPad a couple of years ago with only one CD. As she is now in kindergarten, I felt this would be a great tool for her education. I searched Amazon.com for the product as this version of the LeapPad software is now obsolete. I was extremely happy to find three different products that met my needs and I purchased all three."
5,"I like to read cookbooks, but this is the one I actually USE!","I have been a vegetarian for many years, and I eat mainly Asian style food. My cooking skill are about average. I don't normally cook from a book or follow exact recipes. However, I fell in love with this book at first glance. I had no difficulties with any of the recipes (and I have tried them all). All the recipes are well-written and clear, most are easy to follow even for beginners, and the results will please even non-vegetarians because they taste so good. If you are a beginner, the lists of ingredients and shopping advice will be very helpful, and not complicated or overwhelming. A great user-friendly introduction to a world of delightful vegetarian cooking."
2,Disappointed with this camera,"Baught this camera thinking that it would be identical to the photo provided on amazon.Later on i found out that unlike the camera that my friend had this camera was smaller and a cheap reproduction from china,didn't look durable at all.Since the return policy highlighted the importence of keeping the product sealed,i didn't get a chance to open it and try it.To be quiet honest i was disappointed by this product.I urge you to take a good look at the picture of the FE-170 versus the product you receive."
2,Good For Outdoor Only,"My husband and I decided to upgrade from a 2mp to a 6mp digital camera this year for Christmas. Our old camera was an olympus that we had bought simply because the price was right. After 4 years, it had survived much abuse so we decided to go with olympus again. We purchased the fe-170 with high expectations. The camera took great outdoor pictures in bright sunlight. But indoor pictures had a blue haze to them and when we took the same pic with our 2 mp and compared them, the 2 mp was amazingly better. Conctacted olympus to find out if we just had a bad camera and their reply was to tell us to use the flash indoors, like we had never used a camera before! Took it back to circuit city and exchanged it for Nikon coolpix L1 which we are much happier with!"
1,Junk,"We bought this system over 1 year ago. Horrible echo, no matter what you do with the volumes, and the annoying beep happened with long-distance calls only (my clients really loved that!). Don't get this system. The display on the extra handset is now scrambled - replaced the cheapo battery and it's still scrambled and completely worthless if you have caller ID and numbers stored. Customer support is nonexistent. Good features if you can use the phone - such as intercom and answering machine, which is hard to understand. Stay away from this phone, even if you think it has all the features you want!"
4,"hmm, not bad... not bad at all.","I just finished listening to this disc and i must say, i'm rather pleased with it. The melodies are really simple, and quite beautiful. Being a big fan of groups like Combustible Edison, and 'exotica' pioneers like Martin Denny, naturally i love the arrangement of vibes, bass, percussion and wordless female vocals. But, as stated by the other reviewer, the real draw here is the fantastic classical-style guitar work from Mr. Ribot - quite stunning. This is certainly not to say that the other musicians don't shine throughout the disc as well.My only complaint (although this is something one must come to expect with 'exotica' music) is that just about all of the songs tend to have the same tempo and groove. That really isn't a big deal though.All in all, a pretty solid recording - if 'Masada meets Martin Denny' sounds like an interesting combination to you, definately consider adding this to your list of next purchases."
5,get your practice going,"This DVD from accomplished yoga teacher Barbara Benagh is just the thing to get you going with your yoga practice. I started using Barbara's series of yoga sessions awhile ago now and have enjoyed them tremendously. She seems to set just the right pace, taking time to explore the positions, and also pushing you to new awarenesses. There is so much variety on this DVD that you never seem to be repeating the same sequence over and over as you do on tapes that have only one or two classes. I recommend this DVD for athletes as well as yoga students for a new appreciation of asana from this encouraging teacher."
2,High Hopes,"I had really high hopes for this DVD, especially after seeing that the submenus take you to over 20 different workouts. However, after playing the video, I was not impressed. Now, I am an intermediate yoga practicer, but find that I prefer Vinyasa flow. This has no flow, infact, after each pose, it goes to a break with a screen telling you the name of the pose. There is no flow what so ever. Also, this is very basic. I flipped through some of the sections for each sport and found that they were all very similiar, so even when I thought I would be getting lots of workouts, they are not so different. This may be ok for a true beginner who wants to take their time to get into a pose, and not worry about how one pose flows into another, but for everyone else, just pass on this one. I wish i had."
1,Don't waste your money,"I can't believe how bad this video is! Don't buy it! This isn't a dvd for athletes, it's a dvd for someone who is spastic and mentally impaired. Black screens divide every single pose which takes forever to get to each one, and then you have to stand there through this ridiculous monstrosity of a dvd to get to the next pose. Not only does it NOT provide a workout but it's more like YOGA FOR DUMMIES.THIS DVD IS AN INSULT TO MARKET IT TOWARDS ATHLETES."
4,Realistic contemporary fantasy.,"Not so much a book about lycanthropy as Luciferianism, the bonds of friendship, and family history. Ms Klausner's review below gives all you need to know about the plot. As for my opinion, I think what impressed me most is the way the book remained entirely credible all the way through. Too many modern day horror/fantasy stories fall into the trap of an over-the-top, unbelievable climax (if not before). This one doesn't; everything works. And it has a *perfect* ending."
5,W.E.,"Wow what an incredible movie. Well written and directed by Madonna, of course. Great period piece Arianne Phillips nailed the costuming for this breathtaking movie. It's actually two stories entrtwined together. Absolutely brilliant movie about true love and what someone will do for that love."
3,It's Great To Have But....,"I've been hoping that MGM would release the 2nd season, ever since Season 1 came out in 2002. I was ecstatic when I found out that it was being released. Unfortunately, the package completely turned me off because of the placing of the two episodes of The Inheritors on two different sides of the same disk. What makes this even worse was that there was room on side 2 to keep the two episodes together. I wa shoping to get rid of the VHS copy of the Inheritors that I have, but now that won't happen."
4,Helps you Remember,"I recommend this book as more of a reference than a comprehensive guide. Though aspiring designers may get a lot of ideas from this book, I found it more mix-and-match or quick-fix, complementing what I already know about design. To me, it shouldn't be treated even as a short design course.I use this book to help me as a refresher, and it's very effective that way.(I wish, though, that I had waited for the smaller paperback to come out. The size of the hardcover isn't space-friendly. The smaller one would have been perfect.)"
2,very difficult to use,"Considering what this book cost it is not worth it. The CD has no descriptions and you need to go from book notating what the number is making it very time consuming. The Graphic work is very simplistic and has nothing to offer that is outstanding. Again, useful stuff, but way too much money for what is being given."
3,A quick education in polygamy,"This book was a quick, easy read. I thought it did a good job interleaving the history of polygamy in the U.S. with recent events in that area. It offered an interesting look into the lifestyle.One problem I saw with the book was that it did repeat itself several times throughout the book. Also, it had the feel of an anti-polygamy slant, rather than perhaps a more neutral tone."
3,Nice Bra,"This is the nicest bra I have owned so far. But the description says that you will not know you are wearing a bra, and I still have to take mine off as soon as I get home because I can feel that it is on me. I hate wearing a bra, so I am just a little disappointed that it still feels like I am wearing one."
4,Comfort/Supportive,This bra is very comfortable and also supportive. It doesn't ride up and will buy more in the future.
1,Rambling and DULL,"I read the book cover to cover and doubt that I took anything away at all. It seemed to me to be very disjointed and unorganized in the writing style, flying from one topic to the next without ever fully explaining anything. I'm using the book now to set under my plant so it can get more sun. At-least its getting enlightened by this book."
5,A very good book,"The book gets its objective: to inform managers, academics, students, consultants, about supply chain management (SCM) key success factors. The book is very clear and uses the tipical management language with focus on logistics and supply management terms. Because of the readers segment focus (managers, consultants), the book doesn't use mathematical models but shows many examples of supply chain management good practices, all obtained from firms operating in diferent countries.The introduction gives an overview of the SCM, the following chapters devolop the concepts and methodologies, about the SC integration (pull-push approach), network planning, customer value, global issues, among others."
4,Very nice stand,I use this stand with my ham radio mic. I would recommend it for anyone requiring an adjustable desk top mic stand.
3,I Guess.....,I got it but never used it yet but so far by looking at it it's too short and I don't know if I can work with these.
2,MIC CLIP SOLD SEPERATELY,"The stand is fine... it is quite sturdy with a heavy base. But it DOES NOT come with a mic clip... Meaning: You cannot use this stand unless you buy a compatible mic clip (the plastic mechanism that grasps the microphone & attaches to the stand) - SEPERATELY. ""Fine"" + ""I can't use this"" = Mediocre at best."
5,Work great,I haven't had any issues with these disks and have purchased many of them and will continue to do so
3,A PRACTICAL PURCHASE: Transport all the Gameboy stuff needed,"For his birthday, my son received this case along with his gameboy from Pat McNally, and I'm very appreciative of this accessory. It holds several games, the Gameboy and extra batteries, too. It's easy to open and close (velcro), is a practical color (black), and is well-padded to keep everything inside from breaking - even on the schoolbus. It's a good idea to teach children to value their toys by being organized and keeping them safe."
2,So corny,"Good for a laugh, but not an engaging workout. Also fails to even get my heart rate up at all."
2,Workout DVD,I purchased this DVD for fun exercise but got frustrated and am not able to keep up with the movements. It is probably fine for young people but 50s or above it is not good. The movements are too hard to follow. Too many changes too quickly. I have been very disappointed in it. I have always loved to dance and wanted to learn line dancing but it is too hard to keep up with. I have several other DVDs for workouts and do fine with them but this one just has too many changes too often.
2,country line dance review,"I tried this country dance dvd with my spouse. We both have back and knee problems. All the jumps and knee twists in this dvd where hard to do. If you have bad knees then this is not your dvd. However, just the basic steps (if you leave out all the jumps and knee twisting parts of the line dance) was okay."
3,Country Line Dance,"I have only done this once so far. It was entertaining, not exhausting, but energizing. If you just want to get moving and burn some calories without being really sore the next day, then this is for you. If you are looking for a real intense workout, this is not for you. I like country music, but the songs on this are just some generic beats, not actual country music. Good, not great."
1,Not what expected,I thought since is said country line dance it would have a few line dances in it but it doesn't. They took a few country steps and created a work out from it but not really any line dancing. Would not get this again.
3,"Caution, be careful!","Product ws in excellent shape. Be careful if you have never done yoga, this was for my husband, he hurt himsel and relized yoga is not for him, he will stick to other workouts that have been helpful. The most important thing is to stay active."
2,TOO MUCH MOVING AROUND,"Had to have too many items to do the moves and had to keep moving chairs and mats, etc around."
4,My first yoga cd.,"Because I am fifty and begining with yoga for the first time, I thought this would be a great CD. However, I am not as happy with it as I would of liked. The wspoken dirrections and the model do not seem to be working together. Often the person watching moves before the instructions are givin and for some psese this makes it hard. Also, because it is for inflexible people, it often requires blocks, belts and/or chairs. To use the video correctly, I had to purchase these things. This would have been nice to know in advance, I would of boughten a yoga kit instead. OVerall I give the video about a c plus. (By the way, nearly every video I have watched since this one gives ideas for modifying positions, so I didn't need a specific video to begin with.)"
4,True to the title!,"I've had issues with flexibility since childhood, and I've always been intimidated by yoga for this reason. The title of this DVD appealed, and I had to try it. The Iyengar yoga techniques, which focus on alignment and precision, include modifications for beginner students using props like belts, blocks, and blankets. The instruction can seem repetitious, but since the teacher isn't really there to correct errors, this ends up being helpful in understanding the poses. Even if you end up switching to a different technique later, this provides a good background in the poses. My review would be five stars, but the instruction on breathing wasn't always clear, and there were some errors in the recording. However, there's an impressive variety of workouts from beginner to moving towards more advanced work, and true to the spirit of Iyengar yoga, I've found these techniques to really help in promoting a clearer, less stressed mind."
5,Great beginner DVD,"I purchased this DVD because I am interested in learning yoga for flexibility and strength, but I am very unflexible. The DVD is a great way to start yoga, increasing the exercises as your flexibility improves."
5,A darkly moving effort,"I was very impressed by this first effort from Lonesome Bob. Unlike much of the popular country music, Lonesome Bob's songs are well-crafted, thought provoking and darkly comic. I especially enjoyed the harmonies provided by Bob's back up singer. I look forward to more music from Lonesome Bob in the future. Thanks for offering this CD on amazon!"
3,not in condition supposed to be in,"It is a great book, but not worth the price for this particular copy. Jacket was totally ripped and trashed so I thought overpriced for sure."
2,Agree with bad quality printing,"I am one of Nick's guides in East Africa, and he's shown me the Artist's Edition book of On This Earth, A Shadow Falls. The quality of the printing in On This Earth sadly doesn't capture the quality of his work. His Artist's Edition is so much better and like some other reviewers wrote, his new work is better."
4,Absolutely breathtaking,"Absolutely breathtaking photos of african wildlife. The pictures seem more like portraits and are very unlike any other wildlife photography I have seen before. Only 4 stars for over-Photoshopping (vignette, frame and blurring). Very recommended."
3,"Good product, well supported under Linux, still works in Vista.","Good card, hasn't let me down since I bought it over 2 years ago. Madwifi support is great under Linux. Patched drivers work great for monitor mode, as well as the latest release for stability. Windows drivers on the included disc work under Vista but the wifi manager has problems. Over the past year as my knowledge of wifi products has increased I have come to appreciate the value and usability of this product. To bad the company went under."
4,Fun for All agaes,This is a great series of episodes. It keeps both myself and my kids entertained! The writes are sure to slip in some adult humor that the kids just don't notice. It is smart and fun just like a Pixar movie.
4,My kids really enjoy,"My children, aged 9 and almost 7 thoroughly enjoy this show. It has humor, sometimes a bit adult-edgy, throughout most of the program. It also has clever dialogue where the characters show some respect for one another. Last, there isn't as much slapstick violence as many programs I've seen from Cartoon Net/Nick.I give it 4 stars as it does have a ""too quick"" pace about it much of the time, and there is still some questionable humor that I'd rather not have my 2 kids emulate."
2,I sold mine immediately,"I got this book as a gift and turned right around and sold it. Not one pattern I wanted to make or idea to work with. Others have already mentioned the poor layout of the book and that the designs aren't actually shown on people.The designs are boxy and dated (like a lot of Lily's designs--although she didn't design the work here, it has her stamp on it), and some are entirely impractical (knitted dress anyone?). If you like her work, you may like this book. If you're not nostalgic for the 80's, keep looking."
5,Pink Topaz Ring,This ring was ordered for a little girl. It is a VERY nice ring.It came in a pretty heart box with a bow. We were pleased withthe ring and the speed of delivery.
2,my review,this book is very basic so if you are new and just getting into the tuners then it's something that you might what to buy. However if you already have an understanding of honda cars or if you are looking for information on the k engine I would look to other books.
1,Get the second edition,"This book has good content, but it is: 1. overpriced, 2. dated, 3. peppered with errors here and there, 4. containing a CD that barely merits the cost of pressing.I just used the 2nd Edition to pass the exam and found that it is: 1. $60 cheaper, 2. updated, 3. corrected, 4. having a CD that is as good as any I have seen with a test prep guide.See my review on the second edition to see my story."
2,Thumbs Down,"I found the writing to be less than concise, tending to be both stuffy and rambling. Many of the graphics were amateurish. The question sets could do with explanations of why certain answers are correct. After my first experience with this series, Dan York's fine ""Network Essentials,"" I was expecting a lot more from this book. Especially for the price."
4,Everyone should read or listen,"Everyone in America should read or listen to Derrick Jensen. A voice of sanity, an imperfect man, a sense of humor, and so much to say. My daughter told me about him and I have passed on his books and ideas to all my friends. There can't be enough people aware of his works. By the way, I reserve a 5 star for absolute perfection, if it exists."
4,Neat Little Camera,"It's a neat little camera, and it takes pretty good pictures. Don't expect super high quality photos, but it's worth the money if you have fun with photography and want a little fisheye camera to play with. However, I did have to return it once because the flash broke on mine the first time, but the return was easy, and my new one works just fine!"
4,pretty good camrea,well i have to say this camera is great it has its and good and bad but beside that it a pretty neat camera to mess around with wish it came with a usb connector but buying film isn't bad
4,great for advanced programmers,"Gives a fairly detailed overview of the SAS macro language. Great for users with a little bit of background. The book is not supplemented with an CD, it falls upon the reader to experiment."
1,Not a womens watch,"I'm a woman who really likes bigger watches, but this is definitely a full size mens watch. It also looks very cheap, the picture is misleading. Usually Fossil has great quality and great looking watches but this one just wasn't up to their usual standards."
1,Not for audiophiles,"My wife got me a set of these for Christmas, and I can tell you they will be going back to the store. The sound that comes out of these headphones sounds like it's being piped through two tin cans connected with string. I tried classical music, rock, games, messing with the equalizer, but I could not get the sound to come out to my liking. The sound was crisp, but just didn't sound natural at all, no matter how hard I tried.And then there's the comfort. For a set of headphones with the padding large enough to fit around my ears, I expect the padding to be thick enough to keep the main headphone speakers from touching my ears, but that is not the case here.Between the audio quality and the comfort, I couldn't stand to wear these for more than about 10 minutes. For the price, there's got to be a better headset out there."
3,"Good product, if you don't use 64-bit Vista","They claim on their website that it works with Vista. They don't says that they don't have any Vista drivers ready (after 7 months of Vista being launched) and they only have a BETA Vista 32-bit driver out.I did install XP to try it out and it does work well for 5.1 headset. However, as others have noted in countless reviews, Tritton headphones do not do a good job at reproducing high quality sound and this is no exception (the AX360 product from them is also not that good at producing crisp high-end sounds).I would recommend getting a real sound card or just using the built in 5.1 sound that most PC's come with now and a headset that has true 5.1 sound. I don't think this product is really worth it."
1,not this one!,Bought these over a year and a half ago. Save yourself the trouble and go by a Turtle beach headset instead! These annoying headphones require a driver to use which is incompatable with 90% of computers even with the updates and it WILL NEVER WORK! The mic blew out after about 6 months and the ear pillows squish your ears. I felt more like an air traffic controller then a gamer.
5,Suited for 5-8 yrs olds. Nice book on spiders,"The Spider Makes a WebThe previous reviewer was correct. This book is not for babies or preschoolers as listed in the Product details. It is incorrectly catagorized. It is great for 5-8 yrs.The book goes through the life cycle of a shamrock spider starting and ending with baby spiders hatching and taking to the air with a line of silk trailing from them. It's a nice example of nonfiction children's literature. The spider spins a a daily web and catches a fly, grasshopper and a wasp get stuck in the web and escapes. Simple story line perfect for primary aged children with pleasing illustrations to learn from."
2,green,"it's kinda plain, not nearly as shiny as the pic shows. and the star looked funny, kinda lop-sided."
3,"If the Entry Page Worked, It'd Be Great","This is one of those where I hate to review the entire disc based on the start page, but the producers obviously went to a lot of trouble to make the start page an interactive experience: it's a spy breaking into a high tech office building with voiceover instructions.It'd be really neat if it actually worked. I have an LG Blu-Ray player that was a birthday gift a month ago--and every time I push play at the proper spot, the opening sequence starts over again.As for the series itself, family members say it's great. Maybe at some point I'll get a region 2 DVD player and get this from amazon.co.uk. I hear their discs work."
4,the only way to watch the full series uncut,"These are not cut down episodes shown on A AND E. They are the full bbc broadcasts and run to 59 mins. A AND E cut whole scenes and plotlines to bring he running time down to 45 mins. Forget the agency, enter a very dark world and see into the shadows. Gripping tv"
4,Puzzles that are easy to crack.,"I watch very little TV as I do not find most of it interesting. The puzzles on this show are a little too easy to solve, but all in all, I still like the show."
3,It's OK but a little too formulaic,"I only watched the first episode, so they may still have been trying to find their sea legs, but it was more formulaic--and shallower--than some of the best British shows in this genre (for example, Tinker, Tailor, with Alec Guiness, or The Sandbaggers with Roy Marsden). Maybe I'll give it another try."
3,MI-5 vol. 1,"It is a good program, but my package had 2 #2 discs. So I didn't get the whole years program."
2,Marred by dubious acting and uneven direction,"I wanted to enjoy this series, but was let down by the contrivances in the writing and direction, and some very average acting. Unlike, say, the superb productions of Le Carre's George Smiley novels, the show adopts a kind of Mission Impossible, technology-ridden, slick attitude....but it doesn't have the production values to pull it off, so it always feels kind of cheesy. I enjoyed the contemporary plots and the moral ambivalence, but somehow it crossed a line of implausibility that, say, Law & Order, doesn't.Not without merit, but I really can't give it more than 2 stars."
1,MI-5 season one,"I cannot get the DVD to play on my blue ray and this is the only player I have. My daughter gave me another copy for Christmas and it had the same problem. Perhaps there is a solution to my problem. If so, please help me. I really want to see the program and would be interested in purchasing more of the series if I can get them to play."
5,Criminal Drama at Its Best,"I caught the very first American showing of this on A&E and was hooked. It's smart, serious, and edgy. It pulls no punches, and always has you wondering what will happen next. There's no standard formula like so many of the American shows. ... This drama, about Britain's much more established version of the U.S.'s Dept. of Homeland Security, makes ABC's the Threat Matrix seem like show for Nickelodeon. It stays fresh, smart, and isn't affraid to show the viewer the good with the bad. And it gives glimpses into how other countries, namely Britain, view America's government."
4,Craft and Art,"A good introduction to the techniques and craft of poetry by a renowned poet. It is a short book, but it is enough to get someone started. I read it when I first started writing poetry, and now I'd like to reread it. It's about craft, but also about sensibility--the art of writing a poem."
4,Awesome weight loss tool.,"This is a great book. It illustrates the fundamental theories of health and excercise in a rational straight foward way. Also all the scientific proof is written in the book for the cynics. The point system may not be a favourite for everyone but once you get the gist of the program and start analysing food labels for yourself it is really easy to add in a few more exotic foods. It is very simple to keep track of what you have eaten and how much energy you have expended without having to anlalyse everything you do during the day. One point that may be relevant to note is the ratio that foods should be consumed in. Like all books, it is biased towards the authors background. Body builders like weider and bill phillips recommend far larger meat intakes than this book. This book also focusses on having a greater complex carbohydrate intake than some newer books."
5,An indepth program to achieve your own level of fitness,I have known Dr. Brown for some time now but for the past two years he has been helping me train for the Portland Marathon. The training program he used with me was based on the principles in his book. My first marathon time was 3:11:07 and this year improved to 2:58:16. I guess you can say I'm living proof of the effectiveness of this program.It is a very indepth technique of achieving any level of fitness one may desire. Dr. Brown takes a very conservative approach so as to avoid injury and/or burn-out by including not just hard physical exercise to achieve goals but also everyday activities like gardening(and even sex!)This book is great for those who find it impossible to have their own personal trainer but still have the dedication to want to achieve a more healthier lifestyle
3,Returned this pogo stick.,My 10 yr old son (70 lbs) got this for Christmas and he liked it but it was too short for his heighth so I returned it to Amazon and was charged a $6.14 restocking fee which makes me mad! I had to pay for return shipping which wasn't cheap either due to size of box. So make sure this is what you want so you don't have to return it & pay the restocking fee.
5,tons of fun!!,My kids still play with this after 2 years of getting it. They love it and they get excercise too.
3,Fun Foam Maverick Pogo Stick (Amazon),"A review about this Pogo Stick appeared with my name as the writer. I did not write the review and want it removed. The review was written during the time period thar my computer account had been hacked.I frequently shop with Amazon and have been satisfied with my purchases, including this item. The review that appeared with my name is completely inaccurate. Please remove it. Thank you, Lynda Maenius"
5,So much fun!,"Sturdy, well constructed, and a lot of fun for the child in your life and/or the child in you. Would buy again and recommend."
1,Weld broke after 2 jumps,"Our 40 lb daughter used it twice and then the weld broke, causing the foot piece to slide down. She wasn't hurt, just very sad since it was her favorite Christmas present. Hopefully, the replacement will not be defective."
4,excelente juguete,Gran juguete para los niños. lo recomiendo para darle actividad y q aprendan a tener equilibrio y darles retos .
5,Well-made pogo stick,"I ordered this for my 9-year old daughter for Christmas and was a bit apprehensive about how durable it would be. But, it turned out to be very solid and she has gotten hours of entertainment out of it already. Overall this was a great value."
1,Weld broke at footing after 3000 hops,"This has been my son's favorite Xmas present and has been using it for about 2 weeks now. He is a 5 year old who weights about 45 pounds. He has really enjoyed this pogo stick and has been keeping track of his hops every day. Then on his 3000th something hop ( I added up all his hops) the footing became loose, causing the foot piece to slide down on the shaft. Seems like the welding gave out. I'm exchanging it and will update my rating if the second one is better. Hopefully the manufacturer is taking note since my son is on the lighter end of users and I lubed it as the owners manual stated. This shouldn't happen on such a nice toy:("
5,color,The toy is a great toy and I know a lot of children want them but the colors aren't as attractive to boys as girls. You need to find a more neutral color.
1,Not a good first pogo stick,"This is a total waste of money. My daughter received one for her 5th birthday and can't get it to bounce at all. She is 44 lbs, my 6 year old son couldn't get it to go either. I even had a hard time pushing it up and down trying to loosen it up a bit.I guess it seems well built enough but not designed for smaller kids very well."
2,"Book should be called ""trout vision""","This book was mostly about how trout see the ""outside world"". Although an indepth and interesting read, I was a little disappointed that the book spent so much time on this topic."
4,Good stuff,"I have one of these, and also the more expensive metal version. Both are superior instruments; I rate the metal one as slightly better as one can measure bearings with slightly more precision. These are not cheap, but if you want a really good compass, either this one or the metal KB-14 is the way to go."
4,Great Overview of Ancient Christian Beliefs,"This book was a fine addition to my library!I believe that any student of Christianity should give serious attention to the beliefs and practices of the early Church, and this book gives one a brief but good introduction to those things.It does not have a very good binding, and with use it will crack and break. Care should be used with this book or it will not hold up well.It should be noted that this is an introduction, citing only brief references, and is not an exhaustive study of the Ante-Nicene Fathers. I have a set of the Writings of the Fathers, but often find this book to be a good starting place when I want to study a particular topic.It would also be very easy to fall into the trap of ""proof texting"" with this book. The author warns against this in his preface.With all this in mind, I highly recommend A Dictionary of Early Christian Beliefs to anyone who wants to discover and learn more about their Christian roots."
1,Huh?,"The previous reviewer is absolutely correct. I should have made my purchase @ Amazon so that I could have been warned. ""must read"", maybe for employees of the publishing company.I can't even say that its too technical. What I can say is that it lacks structure."
3,AC & romance don't go hand in hand,"I now know why Agatha Christie's romance novels weren't as popular as her detective fiction. People always like to read romance which has a happy ending i.e the 2 lovers marrying. But in Ac's novels, the 2 lovers invariably seperate. She dvelves deep into human nature, a produces a story.Giant's bread is a touching novel of a genius, Vernon Deyre. He is a genius in music, & thi leads him to break the hearts of the 2 womenen, Nell & Jane who love him. He is wildly infatuated with Nell, a childhood friend,whom he marries, but its only in the end that he realises that he isn't in love with anybody except Jane. He hurts Jane like hell & ina drowning ship, saves Nell instead of Jane, but only after she dies that he realises that he didn't love anybody except Jane. It is a very touching story, especially in the last few pages. But its not recomended for people who like happy endings."
4,"A new approach, not for MOS fans, but I like it","I must say, this is not your typical MOS release. The usual happy house CD1 accompanied by a hard trance CD2 is what every MOS fan expects especially lately from Judge Jules. If you're looking for that, look somewhere else. This complication shocked me when I first heard it, I never thought they would let jimmy do his thing freely on this release. To be honest I only listened to CD 2 by Jimmy Van M, this was the reason I got this CD, and I wasn't disappointed at all. The first 20 minutes or so are his usual slow, dark startup followed by great tracks ranging from Jericho to dark palace. If your looking for something from the Sasha, Digweed expeditions era, this is a good choice."
1,Should've researched it more...,"After much much excitement and almost 20 bucks layed out I was extremely disappointed. The music was really slow, boring and rather dull. The songs start to seem like they're the same as the lack ones. Maybe I'm just too used to other trance but I couldnt' find any trance in this cd!"
1,Lame.,"Godhead is nothing without Marilyn Manson. This is just another attempt by this band to become the next Static X and they fail miserably. Jason Miller has lost his mojo, and IMO, this band will never do anything amazing again. 2000 Years Of Human Error was the last good album by this band, and every album since has been watered down and pathetic."
2,Disappointing,"This GBA game is quite challenging, but that's not my problem with it. The problem is the graphics is low-quality and the levels very repetitive. There's very little to do other than shooting your way around, and all the soldier enemies look the same. The tiny dots that make up the enemies make it difficult to aim and shoot, so the challenge frequently turns into frustration. All this is not helped by rather poor sound effects. I do not recommend this FPS, at least not for purchase at the current high price. I hate myself for falling for the James Bond license and wasting $30."
3,Philsophy on gambling,"Interesting philosophies on life and gambling. But he doesn't have a firm grasp of zen, good marketing though to add Zen into the title to draw people in."
2,Horrible Book,"I bought the book based on many of the reviews. I wish now that I hadn't. Although I did find a few ideas in the book about taking risks interesting, hence two stars instead of one, overall it was pretty bad. At one point I almost stopped reading, but felt compelled to finsih in the hopes that it got better.A lot of the ideas presented are laughable. For example, ignore the advice of experts (which the author presumably qualifies as) or do the opposite. So basically, you should do nothing the author himself suggests.I did find the authors advice on keeping fit and healthy interesting, but at the same time takes it too far into the land of junk science. I wholly expected him to begin touting about homeopathic medicine and aromatherapy.A waste of money."
4,The original of Blade Runner is the best.,"I prefer the original version of Blade Runner, the directors cut is confusing for new Sci Fi fans. It takes away one of the most important aspects of the movie, the Harrison Ford voice over which explains Dekkers thoughts and main plot details."
4,Useful tool to new fathers!,"My wife bought me this book a few weeks after we found out she was pregnant. I didn't have a clue about anything and this book really gave me so much useful information that it made the pregnancy and birth of our son so easy for me to handle.We took a parenting class and so much in the class that we leaned I was already familiar with because of this book. I didn't freak out about certain things because I knew what to expect. This book helped me understand the different phases my wife would go through and it allowed me to have a more understanding and patience with things. The delivery was a snap because of what this book prepared me for, along with class.This book is well worth it and I highly recommend it. Don't panic, get the book!"
3,"Not of of the better known Shakespeare works, but very good anyway.","Entertaining and a great example of Shakespeare's incredible strong female characters. An example of the times and includes just a little bit of history.The play isn't usually on the high school reading list, but I liked it anyway. There are some strong stereotypes, but it's probably more of a reflection of the time, rather than the author. I found it to be one of Shakespeare's more straightforward plays, but the No Fear version always helps a great deal."
2,Not Good Enough,"I purchased the first volume of this book, which was written by Prof. Platzer. It was a great book. This book is the 3rd volume and covers the neuroscience, but it is not enough for your anatomy exam if you are a med student. In other words, studying from this book is a waste of time. However, it is a relatively well-written book and if you have the time, you can review some stuff that you have already learned from your main source."
4,not bad at all....,this product does help with curing ringworm. not great for scalp ringworm but great to use on your body!!! cures it within days =) i give it four stars because of the scalp issue. otherwise works great!!
1,"Only good for history, poor for collectors","The author of the book is the President of Rochard, a major producer of Limoges Boxes. If you want to learn about the history of the porcelein and painting techniques - read on. However, I wanted to learn more about the different artists and manufacturers. Mr. Sonking features only his ""Rochard"" boxes. Too slanted for my taste."
3,Esta coleccion es un resumen de la novela,"El servicio de este vendedor es bueno, bastante rapido el envio, pero acerca del contenido no es muy bueno, se encuentra en calidad estandar, no abarca toda la pantalla en caso de que tengas una television hdtv, ademas de ser solo un resumen muy corto de la serie, solo pone un poco de lo mas esencial para comprender la trama y ya esta en poco mas de 3 horas ya viste todo, en fin, en tanto mi mujer este contenta con lo que vio, no hay problema."
5,Good overview,"This DVD is a great overview of general flash usage and the features of the 580/580II and 430 Canon flashes. If you are beginning to shoot flash or controlled situations, after shooting natural light, this will be a helpful introduction."
4,Chill and Thrill!!!,I think it was scary at the end of each chapter if you like goosebumps you will like this!!
3,its been done before,"ive heard of june for a while now and i was anticipating a great release. i bought the cd and i was kinda letdown. the vocals sound very similar to that of patrick stump(sp?) from fall out boy. and that just didnt impress me. i know a singer sing's the way they do and cant help it, but its just been done before. dont hate me for this review. there's some good things about the album. these guys have some stellar musicianship going on. the songs are catchy, dont get me wrong. and they recorded with an amazing producer...brian mctiernan(thrice, strike anywhere, the movielife). so anyway, i would definitely recommend this album if youre into the the new school punk rock.check this out if youre into spitalfield, (old) starting line, and fall out boy. ill give the cd a few more spins. maybe my view will change."
3,vintage,"vintage, classic, nostalgic. all words sum this box set up. very good set to have for the avid fan. i saved it for a rainy day. only wished the coverage of some of the old games were a bit longer, as you dont get the whole game, just key moments... and the more recent seasons, i already had from another box set, so was a little disappointed with that, but that was my own doing. and not every world series is covered... i think only 17 out of the 26. overall, a great buy to have all the yankee classic moments preserved on dvd. go yankees!"
4,"Good marker, but it has a strong odor.","I purchased two of these markers a few months ago. I love how huge the markers are and they work/write well, but I cannot stand the strong odor that they have. In order to fully use this marker, one must use it in a very well ventilated area, so that he or she does not become light-headed from the odor that the marker has. If anyone out there is thinking of purchasing this marker, please think carefully about purchasing it."
3,bob dyland sounding,"I did not enyoy this record as much as the other reviewers did .Yes it comes out as a member of the alarm the guitar player but it sonds nothing like the alarm ,its sounds like bob dyland.It has good guitar playing and songwritting but the singer sounds just like bob dyland and it has female singer in the back ground on a few songs just like bob dyland .If you are looking like i was for the alarm sounding stuff try mike peters ,if you like bob dyland try this cd if you dont stay away .I hope this review was helpful to you"
1,pop psychology gone bad,"This was such a waste; I didn't even finish it (and I'm a real book lover). It was clearly written for a female audience, but that's not obvious when you buy it! Also, she seems to be neo-Freudian with her wanting to go back to our childhood to see why we made up the ""stories"" that still govern our lives. This, of course, is in contrast to today's generally accepted psychotherapy of CBT.She provides 3 (or 4?) lame questionnaires that are supposed to tell you what your personality type is, but each questionnaire is only 20 questions. You can get a more accurate picture of yourself online for free.Some of her analyses of patients seem contradictory, and although the anecdotes are somewhat interesting I could find *none* that came close to my situation. I still don't know what my ""stories"" are, and even if I did, I'd have no clue how to rewrite them.Don't waste your money."
4,My aunt's favorite,"I used to use this coffee after we visited Costa Rica and gave some to my aunt. She thinks it is the best coffee there is, so I gave her some for Christmas. It is excellent."
5,Coffee from Amazon.com,"This coffee is the smoothest dark roast coffee I have ever tasted,and it was a pleasure to sip this full bodied coffee before breakfast and after dinner."
1,Poetry In Slow Motion,"This one started out bad, got a tiny bit better around three quarters of the way through and then crashed and burned with the conclusion. Stilted, dull and mind numbingly bad with a ""twist"" ending so infuriating that I wanted to toss the book through the window. Actually, two twist endings but whose counting. I have read everything I can get my hands on from Black Lizard and this is the first one that really let me down. If I hadn't been on a weekend vacation with only this book as company, I wouldn't have read it. Robert Browning should have been the big tip off. Historical literary figures don't solve crimes. Not Edgar Poe or Jane Austen or, God help us, Robert Browning. And every book I have come across that tried to paint them in this light have been unanimously bad. Add to this, a narrator that is both pedantic and duplicitous and you have a book that treats the reader very badly. Skip it. Seriously."
3,Got it to work,Took a little research to make the XM work in my 2004 Mustang Mach 1 but it now works. I had to move the location of one of the wires in the harness. Apparently Terk had a batch that their vendor messed up but after calling terk I received no help because my car wasn't supported. I pointed out that the 2004 Mustang was their installation vehicle so there was no reason why it wouldn't work. Mine said NO SAT until I moved the wire. I have posted pictures on the Mach 1 registry if anybody needs to see what wire to move. It's nice having the controls in the stereo although it is somewhat quieter than normal radio so I have to turn up the volume a bit. All in all I'm satisfied but some help would have been appreciated.
5,Daughter still plays after 5 years.,My daughter got this when she was 2. She turning 7 this year. She still plays with it. I give this toy 2 thumbs up.
1,Worked only 1 month,"Started out great, then by the time we had to change the batteries, it never worked right again. Replaced batteries thinking it was that, but the motor just didn't want to work right. Am looking to return it or throw it in the trash!"
3,Take a little more time.,"He teaches all of the poses at once. It would be nice if the positions were grouped. For example if you learned 3 or 4 then went back and started the sequence at 1, learned the next four and went back and started from 1 etc...It would also be nice if he took a little more time on the footwork and hand motions."
2,left right left,"I liked everything about the video except I could not overcome the left right confusion or so-called ""mirror"" technique. For example, I would look at the video as the instructor verbally describes moving weight to the right leg and he is clearly shifting to his left leg. Apparently some people don't have a problem with this, but I found it difficult to follow."
3,Too many camera angles,"Leave it to hollywood to have 97 cameras for a simple instructional video, looks nice but's hard to follow the instructor when you jump from a frontal view to a camera on crane or a jib when your in the middle of leaning a series of moves. I watched and learned on a old cheap video from the library that was better than this because the use one camera angle. The production value of this video is way overblown resulting in a nice looking but hard to follow instructional video. You will be watching this guy, tying to mirror his moves in opposite side of the body then they do a 360 around the guy and your left trying to listen to what he is saying and it gets confusing. Poorly thought out, should have tested it on beginners."
1,terrible instruction,"This video could have been good, if the instructor knew his right from left, unfortunately it is total confusion if you listen to him while trying to do these moves.I suggest, one, get another dvd, two watch the dvd but turn off the instructor as his right and left instructions are totally contrary to what is shown in the action.And also number three, if you get this thing and have ordered it, do not open it, just return it to avoid confusion and monetary loss."
2,not what I thought,"I used a beginners tai chi with Scott Cole a few years ago. I loved it and it helped with balance issues and felt like a workout. This DVD is so disappointing. Too many small steps. They ask you to inhale and 6 steps later to exhale. That's not going to happen. After 30 min. I felt like I accomplished nothing. Too much detail took the joy that I remember out of Tai Chi. There is nothing in these tai chi moves that will be of help for my balance. I got so annoyed I turned off the DVD. The rest may be better, but I wasn't going to use another 30 minutes to see."
2,Betrayal in Blood,"Very seldom give a negative review, however, this author's cast of characters is oftentimes confusing. Too much dull repetition. Story could have been told in a lot less pages. Sorry, but honest assessment. Jeanne K."
3,"Better than the 3rd, but not as good as the 1st","I thought this was better than the third one but I did not care for the characters as well as I did Bailey and Cade. Sometimes Jack seemed a little too cold, and M.J. seemed kind of witchy-with-a-B. I didn't like how ticked off he got when she started to cry. Some people have emotions, it's not a character flaw. And I thought the lovemaking scene at the mountain house was out of character for him, not to mention VERY corny. But at least it didn't have the STUPID ending of the third book. And I didn't find it believeable that M.J. would be a fifth-degree blackbelt, or that she could fall in love with someone who once handcuffed her to a cheap motel room bed. Unless she's in to that kind of thing. But don't get too excited... it's not what you think. But if she's a fifth-degree black belt? Why does she run from the bad guys? Why doesn't she just beat the snot out of them?... Oh, and one more thing... EW! She wears Grace's clothes without any underwear???"
2,This Book Is Outdated!,"I purchased this book to use as a guide for my first big block hot rod build up. What I have is a huge disappointment. This book is very old and outdated, and most of the points do not make any sense. It continually says that aftermarket parts are inferior to GM parts. Plain and simply put, a lot of steps have been taken in the automotive aftermarket world that this book does not talk about nor should it, since it was written so long ago that Jegs, and Summit did not even exist.Save your money instead of buying this book, unless you are a very unskilled, and you plan on using junk yard parts to build your engine."
2,flimsy and plasticky,"This blanket looks nice and its case is convenient. But it's so light that it blows away when you try to lay it out on the grass, and flaps up around you when you sit on it--or worse, when you put your baby on it. It's also slippery, so if you try to have a picnic on a slope you (and your child) will either slide off it or you will slide down the hill--or both!"
4,Nice product. Easy to clean. Worked well on beach.,Nice product. Easy to clean. Worked well on beach. Is very light weight so the wind picked it up a few times. Plan to keep in my truck for the park or picnics.Nice design too.
3,Good blanket for price,This blanket is easy to fold in the carry pouch. I recommend washing it first because it is not soft when you first get it. I do NOT recommend for hills - the nylon bottom will act as a bobsled on anything other than a flat surface. Stitching is strong and the colors didn't fade at all when I washed it.
5,Perfect Size,This blanket is the perfect size and very long. Only wish it was a bit softer but it serves it's purpose to be able to lay on damp grass at outdoor concerts.
4,"Love,Friends,Compassion in the Wild West.","If you watched the 7+ years of the tv series this is a must see, if only because Dr.Quinn, Sully, and the gang are present."
4,#1 Dr. Quinn fan!,"I am Dr. Quinn's #1 fan. I loved these movies. Revelations was the better of the two to me because it was set out west like the actual Dr. Quinn series, and The Heart Within was set entirely in Boston. I'm only giving Amazon 4 out of 5 stars because part of the DVD case was broken upon arrival. It doesn't hold the DVD in place properly, but it wasn't worth sending back."
5,Great movies,I was delighted to see what happened to the gang on Dr. Quinn. I wish the show could have gone on as it is really good. I love watching the reruns when I can.
4,Good stuff,The movies are an excellent addition to the Dr. Quinn franchise. I received the product sooner than expected and exactly as described. I thought that both movies stayed true to what the tv series was all about and was not disappointed!
3,Dr Quinn Medicine Woman - The Movies,Loved the television show. The movies weren't one of my favorites.
4,"Fun, Frisky, and Inviting...","Unlike a few we've read, this book was written from a more hetero- friendly point of view. Although there are scenarios described between alternative couples, they are tastleful and much less anecdotal in nature than some that seem to be more of a BDSM gay's memoirs. We enjoyed the scene suggestions and perspectives offered into a bottom's head space. This revised book is written assuming one is not just a 'curious beginner', so it didn't overdo the often present common-sense ""safety"" section, and it's definitely not a 'how-to'...instead I found it an insightful and pleasant read for the novice bottom."
5,Good information,"After reading this book, Being a bottomer doesn't feel as bad anymore. I always felt a little degrading but this books shows a different side of that perspective. It doesn't only explain the feeling of a bottomer but also a little bit about the dom as well."
3,it was ok,"This product arrived quickly, but the king size seemed to be too big for the comforter, and the brown micro suede attracts dirt, dust, etc. and looks dirty quickly is you used it regularly. I do think it is soft, and will be using it this summer with out the comforter inside to be a cool lightweight ""summer blanket""."
3,Mistitled?,"This is really an album of modern guitar music with one classic jazz piece, Blue Rondo a la Turk, added at the end. No criticism of the music or the playing, but I found the title misleading. The last piece I enjoyed very much, the rest of the album somewhat less."
1,"Poorly argued, poorly filmed, poorly made","This is little more than a badly made infomercial for a particular viewpoint. The arguments in it are specious at best. It doesn't come across as something that anyone would pay a moment's attention to, were this not an election year. Once this film's 15 minutes are up, it will be forgotten forever."
2,"Tight Draft, Loose Final","When Jordan Orlando completed the initial draft of this story at the University of Chicago, it was a tight little story of roughly 200 pages. Add a New York publisher and several hundred pages of padding, and the story is somewhat less satisfying."
4,"Great, Yet Amusing, Memories","What a great book! Most of the tests were very thorough, yet it is rather amusing to see how well they thought the cars handled back then. I guess they thought it was great that the tires didn't pop off the rims; that meant it was a great-handling ride! Very good pictues showing excellent details for those looking to do a home restoration/ resto-mod job to their classic musclecar. I enjoyed reading some of the ""modern technology"" that either faded off into oblivion - the donut spare that you filled with freon & also console/floor-mounted tachs, to stuff that we now take for granted - disc brakes & fast-ratio steering. This book has no added modern fluff or editing done to it; it's all original articles from when the cars were brand new. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to relive those days, and to those who were born too late to 'survive' the experience."
1,Garfield Sucks,"...What was once a mildly amusing comic suitable for children and those with small intellects is now an overhyped piece of consumerist mass-market drivel. It's not enough for Jim Davis to just do what he presumably loves (making comics, I mean--not making money by the bucketful), he can't simply retire on his laurels, instead he has to push it always further with yet another bit of Garfield pollution. Car-window decorations, yearly calendars, posters, plush toys, and even a motion picture!What's funny about Garfield? He's a fat cat with an ...owner who eats lasagna. Big deal. Get over it.Garfield is a tumor in the colon of popular culture. He's a plague that must be exterminated..."
2,Douglas Chase Border Collie,Adorable and very realistic. I bought this puppy to displaywith a larger life-sized Border Collie. They look so real and match perfectly. I could not be more pleased.
4,"Finally, a real Hanukkah toy!!!",Just adorable. Very hard to find!! I have never seen a REAL toy for Hanukkah and this one was so nice.
5,So Helpful,"This book is so hard to find, can not buy it new ever again. Loaded with fantastic information that has helped me tons. I recommend it highly. God Bless, Danna from Horse Country USA!"
4,It's a Jungle in Here! (and an ocean... and the Jurassic period!),"This tube comes with an assortment of dinosaurs, ocean themed animals and a few safari critters. Since its called a *safari* tube, I expected more animals in that style and was a bit disappointed that less than half the figures are not safari themed.However my kids did not mind at all and actually have played with the ocean ones more! A few of the animals included are a dolphin, lion, zebra, sharks, penguin, crocodile and a bunch of dinosaurs, plus many more. It's a nice assortment and they are not too small but aren't huge either. They are a nice size to line up and play with or take on the go. A good buy overall."
3,"Blaze looks great, the rest not so much","Blaze gives a performance straight from his dark and twisted heart in this DVD. The rest of the band is definitely not show-stopping, but the camera mainly focuses on Blaze and his antics, which sometimes left my brother and I laughing hysterically.It was cool to see some Maiden songs on here but then again it wasn't Murray, Gers, McBrain and Harris playing them.I don't pull this DVD out too often, but as I don't have any DVD's of Blaze singing for Maiden, I have to settle for this."
3,One Great Track,"It boggles my mind to see how many versions of Guest are available. I finally found the right one to review. Anway, on with the review. Besides the teen summer anthem ""California"" which you get sick of quickly, the fun but too-short Beatles-sounding ""Hey Girl,"" and the very good ""Always On My Mind,"" the only suberb track on this album is Track seven: ""Turn, Smile, Shift, Repeat."" The words, singing, and electronic mixing are musical genius.Tracks three, four, and five, ""Lonely Day,"" ""One Ray of Sunlight,"" and ""Anthem"" are ultra-Disneyfied. Listening to these tracks, you feel as if you accidentally ingested too much sugar. With all that is going on in the world today, and the harder-edged, alternative groups that are popular today, how did Phantom Planet come up with such Pollyana lyrics in these three tracks?If you pop this CD into your PC, you can access the ""Hey Girl"" music video, ""California"" with commentary, and Phantom Planet's website."
5,Great!,"This is unbelievably good. Phantom Planet is awesome! This is one of their best albums, too. I love all the tracks on here. Some of there songs are so upbeat and fun, but some of them are slower. I mean, I love like Pink Floyd and the Ramones and Black Sabbath and stuff, but this album totally caught my ear. It is great! It varies my music also. Variation can be good!"
4,Good pop album!,"In agreeance with the review by Kim, I'd say there isnt anything extremely mind-blowing about the CD other than its strategically written melodies and production, which isnt all bad. In fact, probably one of the best pop albums of 2003. In response to the last post:Califonia is a great pop track that deserves its due diligence as one of the most well-written pop songs of the last few years. Just because it was bastardized by the O.C. doesnt mean its a bad song nor a bad album. Do a little listening before you bash numb nuts."
4,Despise and Like,"This band is way to easy to dismiss, they have a former model as a lead singer and Rushmore boy as a drummer. It sounds ludricuous, but even more ludricrous is that they are good. I heard ""California"" on MTV2, and found myself humming and singing along at the most random moments in my life. It was maddening, and I was furious at PP for making such a catchy song. But I soon relented and downloaded the rest of the album, which are equally catchy, and now I have the album proper. Sunny Rock is a valuable commodity these days, too many people are mad and lonely, its nice to have some happy stuff. I personally think Happy stuff is infinitely harder to write, but thats me. Just buy the bloody album and succomb to the pure unabashed beauty of melodic happy rock."
4,Has Its Moments.,"Well i picked this one up the other day. So i listened to it and some of the better songs came to mind. Heres a review of the cd:California: Great intro from the piano. Gets annoying after a while so dont overplay like I did. ( 4.0 )Always On My Mind: REALLY GOOD. Never gets old obviously one of the better songs of the cd. ( 4.9)Lonely Day: Awesome.

2,Read this before buying.,"I recently saw an Incubus concert and Phantom Planet opened for them. I had heard the song California and thought that Phanton Planet might be pretty good. When I heard their other stuff, I was suprised how bad it was. The played about 6-7 songs and California was the only good one. I agree with gokudragon3, please listen to more of their songs before buying their CD. Hope this helps."
3,It's a Classic,"It's the pocket book every designer has to have it in their studio.Anyway, I think the larger edition is better."
1,Don't bother,I'm usually a fan of dummies books and have several on my bookshelf. I'm also a huge fan of LEGO's. I have to say that this book is dissapointing on so many levels. There is nothing new in here that hasn't been covered in one of the many unofficial guides that dummies is shamefully trying to compete with. In fact the robots described come straight from the Constructopedia that LEGO gives away free in every Mindstorms box. Other than having a CD of some useful utilities don't bother. Everything on the CD you can get for free on the net. You should have no problem finding them. In fact if you don't know how to find LEGO related websites on your own you shouldn't be fooling around with robots in the first place. But I drift away from the intent of this review. Don't bother with this book. If you have a Mindstorms kit you have a computer. If you're reading this you're on the net. Spend the $20 on some more LEGO's or one of the unofficial books. You'll get more out of it.
4,Its good,I like it becuase it is easy to use and has a website that goes along with it so that if you buy the book you gain access to the website for more information.
1,Two Problems,"This item has two problems: 1. There is no RCA cable in the package, 2. The insulation on the power and ground cables is much thicker than is necessary, and I am afraid that I am not going to get the full effect of 1/0GA and 4GA size cables. Unpleased with my purchase. Amazon's help was no help at all, even though the item was sold directly from Amazon at the time I bought it(not sold from a seller using Amazon)."
1,Warped,"I used this baking sheet about 5 times at 375 degrees or less. I was baking chicken at 375 degrees and heard a bang. I looked in the oven and sure enough, it had warped."
1,Warps!,Maybe I got a lemon at BB&B but the finish yellowed quickly and the pan sounds like a gunshot when I put it in the oven over 350 degrees. Sucks! I got a 2 pack and they both warp at higher temperatures. I have never put them in a dishwasher or dinged these pans in any way. Very disappointing.
2,Cannon User,"This product has a known defect that the company is keeping quiet. The defect is the ""laser shutter"" a little bracket that apparently is not strong enough to do its job. Repair people say they are getting many calls on this ""known problem."" In fact they say they know what is wrong when they get the call for a won't print repair. Cannon should offer to fix this problem as part of a campaign and not wait for a breakdown on a machine that may be past its one year on site warranty.Canon MF6550 Duplex Copier Laser Printer"
2,3X recording a liability,"Recording on the RQ-L31 precludes playback on other equipment. Quality transcribers don't have three-times playback, so you are relegated to using this recording device for playback and transcribing."
1,What do these other reviews have to do with this product??,"The item I just clicked here and bought and downloaded and opened was NOT ""The Works: Alfred Lord Tennyson,"" but, on opening the item with that title in my Kindle, turned out to be ""Becket and Other Plays."" No poems. Whatever. Also no search function (""not yet indexed"")."
5,Outstanding Survivor's Manual,"This remarkable story of one survivor, and her struggle to find herself, is not just a story of sexual abuse, as important as that is, but is a manual for those in authority to be able to recognize and deal with abuse of all kinds when it shows itself in any community of followers of Baha'u'llah. This book enables the reader to delve into their own lives, and root out the cause of fears which prevent them from becoming their true selves. It focus's on violence and abuse and makes one mindful of the effects of the old world order. ""How can we help others"" is the main thrust of this wonderful book. I recommend its reading to all members of the family of the Most Great Name."
1,Review for lomolitos,Terrible product. DO NOT BUY! The flimsy red filter is the whole reason for a substantial markup over a disposable camera...Just cut out some red see-through plastic...that's what Lomography has done.
4,exactly as discribed,this little stuffie is cuter than a bug and exactly as discribed in the ad. only complaint is that i had to purchase more stuffing to stuff it as that which came with it was not enough.
2,Madden 2001 vs gameday 2001,There is no comparison between these two. It looks like Sony did not put any effort into the gameday release. I have played the Gameday series for the past three years and have finally switched to Madden Madden 2001 graphically/gameplay is leaps and bounds ahead of gameday. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON GAMEDAY 2001. RENT BEFORE YOU BUY.
1,DONT BUY ME!!!!,"this games graphics,limited options,stupid plays,kindegardenly made,etc.(and i am not joking when i say,etc.)are so incredibaly, horrificly ,dreadful!!!dont waste time thinking about the low offer, go out and buy madden 2003,2004,because any maddens are worth it unlike any gamedays.the same customer who wrote a reiview on killswitch who is 13 for your cocern!!!SO DON'T BUY THIS SUCKY THING THEY CALL A GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"OK, but no Cigar","I've been buying football games since the NES days. As the gaming revolution brought us more and more graphics, the difference between today's games evolves around gameplay. GameDay 2001 is an average game at best. In the two times that I've played this game, I notices several errors. First, my St. Louis Rams' roster is a complete mess. They had my defensive ends lined up in the defensive tackle position and vice versa. They have the wrong personel returning kickoffs (Phroel) and punts (bruce). The QB, when he steps back and throws the ball to the right, his arm slings left. It seems clear to me that 989 rushed to finish the game and they over looked many of the small details that are important to the ""hard-core"" gamers like myself."
1,poor poor poor,"this is possibly one of the worst football games ive ever played!!if you are going to spend 50 bucks get madden 2001. the game play is horrible, but the graphics are nice."
3,Convection Oven,I really like this counter top oven....Im still trying out different foods and trying to get used to it. It really does a great job on chicken breasts. Im still working on the vegetables. Fish is great too!
3,like the size,"I really like the size of the oven, not too big. However I did not know that it has to preheat for 6 min @ 475 degrees. I probably would not have purchased it. Also the comparison cooking guide is very vague, not stating whether food (ie meat) is frozen or thawed or fresh. I think I should've forked out the extra cash for the oven!"
5,great teaching resource,This book is excellent for planning a comprehensive spelling programme. It is full of ideas and theory to help teachers understand the best ways to structure spelling all the way up to 14 year olds. It is easily the best resource I have come across in my 20 + years of teaching spelling to 10-14 yr olds.
3,If you buy..,If you buy this pie pan don't ever use a metal implement on it. I used a pie serving spatula to cut and serve the pie and it took off the coating. Once the coating is cut into the pan rusts.
5,Looks just great!,"I have not used this pan yet, but intend to soon. It is exactly what I wanted and could not find in stores! Deep dish, metal, nice weight."
1,Not for prebake pie shells,"I bought these to make my Mom's recipe Chocolate Cream Pie. I had plenty of crust to shape around the edges, and put plenty of fork holes throughout. After baking for 12 minutes, the crust slid halfway down the steep sides of the pan and the upper edges burned, while the bottom center puffed up and didn't bake all the way through. They would probably work fine for fill and bake pies, but I am returning them."
3,Scoby Doo Costume,"Head was too large and was hard to keep up, had too much stuffing in it. Otherwise it was adorable. He wanted the costume real bad and was disappointed."
2,Size runs VERY small,I am so disappointed. I ordered a medium based on the size chart provided. I expected the costume to be big on my son and that was okay because I knew he would want to wear it for monthes after Halloween. Instead the costume is EXTREMLY small. It only came down to just below my sons knees. There is no way he can wear this costume.
1,Uhh the games not out yet,"With all this chatter about the guide providing all the wonderous help, i wonder how it can be helpful if the game HAS YET TO BE RELEASED? I mean when it comes out in APRIL it may be helpful to some, but parents dont waste money on this for your kids until the game is out. Look for HL2 in april, before then buy them some shakespear or something. Just an attempt by whoever made the book to get some quick XMAS cash from some unsuspecting customers."
2,The Reviews Are Right!,"Everything that I read about this device was right on the money. Product is very difficult to remove once you have it on and the whinning sound is terrible. But it does charge your Zune....YIPPY! Even at the price I paid for it, this item is not worth the money."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I will chime in with my own negative review. Sold my Kensington which sounded fine, in order to have this one that charges too. Big Mistake, sound quality is awful, with lots of background noise. There is no reason I should have to listen to the hard drive, and the noise from going through my songs."
2,"Does what I wanted, but it is as bad as they say (see comment for workaround)","First, I have to say that this does exactly what I wanted--I bought the device for the cable (maybe I'll toy with the transmitter for some kind of project). The cable provides audio out from the Zune, obviously, and powers the device--exactly what I wanted for a cheap, DIY Zune dock.I did happen to test it as an FM transmitter, and found the sound to be as bad as everyone said. Trying to listen to one Beatles song via FM transmission was noisy and headache inducing. I'm not sure if this thing needs some shielding or what, but you might be better served by running a wire straight to your antenna and bypassing the transmitter. You can't just to that and expect it to work, but it might give you silence or static, which is better than this transmitter can do."
3,not bad,"The transmitter works well. Every now and then you get static and it's not as loud as your normal stereo, for the price I paid it does the job."
1,"The Big Valley, Season 1","I don't usually comment on items I purchase however I must let you know how disgusted I am with this purchase. You may have disclosed that there were three disk in the package, I don't remember. However, it does no good to tell the buyer there are three disk if you fail to first tell the buyer that there should be five (5) disk to complete the season. You represented this purchase as 'season one' complete unless you say otherwise. I will make a notation of your name so that I'm sure not to purchase from you again. BTW, the condition of the disk was no more than ""fair"". Not happy with this purchase. I feel as though I've been taken advantage of.Barbara"
5,The Big Valley Dvd season 1,"I received the dvds earlier then expected! Not only was I happy with how early they arrived, but I was also very happy with the quality!"
5,Great Nostalgia Trip,"All the episodes I have seen so far are in very good condition, as advertised. Disc play perfectly. Great memories."
3,MISLEADING PRODUCT,"The title stats "" The Complete Series One"" DVD is only the 1st season. At $159 this is a total RIPOFF!!!"
5,I HOPE THEY GET ALL FOUR SEASONS OUT!!!!,"Primarily because of Barbara Stanwyck, this has and will always be my favorite television Western. The Bonanza boys had nothing on the Barkleys. This family was ""real"". They had real disagreements, great conflicts, dangerous situations and the series was intelligently written, produced and directed and brilliantly acted by its distinguished cast led by the incomparable Barbara Stanwyck. I simply cannot wait for this to come out and I hope they get the rest of the seasons out. This series has never been out of syndication and has remained consistently popular over the years. It is an excellent program!!"
5,Great viewing,"I would like to thank you for making this very old series available in DVD. I really liked this show and liked seeing Barbara Stanwych, as well as a young Linda Evans and Lee Majors before they went on to star in their own shows. The western genre in those times was interesting as well as entertaining so thanks again for giving us added pleasure in reliving those old shows without the blood and gory and violence of today. It's nice to sit and watch a show with the family without wondering what will appear to scare young ones. Thanks again."
1,not happy with it.,"i know this book is use but, when i got it, it's to many writing on it...this is the reason i don't buy use one this is my first and i was dissapointed...sorry..."
4,Beautifully written and photographed book - inspiring,This book is beautiful! It's written in a concise manner and the recipes are some that I haven't seen in any other soap book. The pictures in it are awesome as well. I haven't tried any of the recipes YET - but I sure do plan to try some soon. I kept rereading it and rereading it! Just lovely!
1,"maybe for beginner, but not so great for experienced soapmak","I returned this book. As an experienced soapmaker, I found that this book just repeated a lot of the same information from other books I have read. There are better books out here and this one is pretty mediocre. I would recommend ""Essentially Soap"" over this book."
3,Good Source of Information but Caution on Recipes,"I like the way the book is organized and written, and the photos are inspiring. The writer does a good job of organizing the topics. I found the lists of additives, essential oils, and fillers especially interesting and informative, and I return to this section often. However, after plugging in a few of her recipes in a lye calculator, I was disappointed in the lye heavy recipes. I felt this was very lazy editing and a potential danger to new soap makers who do not know how to design their own recipes. I checked some of her sap values and they are correct, but, out of a sampling of 5 recipes, 2 recipes are lye heavy: ""Grapefruit Slice"" is -1.6% lye heavy; ""Fresh as a Cucumber"" is also -8% lye heavy. However, ""Blackberry Smoothy"", ""Peach Melba"", and ""Strawberry Soap"" are all okay. If you already know how to design your own recipes, this is a good book for inspiration."
2,Not satisfying,"Though unrated, it would not be worse than PG-13. There are stories of 3 children who want to leave their countries to go another. Each encounters serious problems, and learn that ""the other side"" is not necessarily a good place to go. Three different accents: Mexico, Cuba, Spain. There is no real culmination, or tying together of the three stories, so in that way you are left hanging, but it could be used in an AP class as a springboard for discussion."
4,The Future Is Now,"I was just as impressed by the music and soundtrack of MEET THE ROBINSONS as I was by the visual images from the film and, therefore, decided to get the soundtrack. Like the characters in the movie, the songs on the cd fit into a wide range of genres. Rufus Wainwright, Rob Thomas, The All-American Rejects, They Might Be Giants, Jamie Cullen, and Jonas Brothers all contribute to songs on the MEET THE ROBINSONS SOUNDTRACK. The score is by Danny Elfman and is a pretty good one. The songs from the score that I especially enjoy are, ""Goob's Story"" and ""A Family United."" The lyrical songs that I enjoy most from the album are:""Little Wonders""--Rob Thomas""The Future Has Arrived""--The All-American Rejects""There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow""--They Might Be Giants.If you really enjoyed the movie or are a fan of Danny Elfman's music, then this is a cd that you will probably enjoy."
3,"So close, and yet so far....","I love Ash, and ive listened to 1977 millions of times, but Nu-Clear sounds was not the wonderful album i'd hoped for. It's got some great songs, like projects and wild surf, but as a whole it's a huge step down from 1977. It seems like Ash is trying to be harder and grungier, but they cant quite get it. If you've got some extra cash, I think you should buy it, but don't expect another 1977."
4,Morbidly Humorous...,"...And if you can't stomach it, then why waste your time here? Those who read these kinds of things should not be mistaken with those of slap-stick 'low-humor' denizens... we appreciate the darker side of life. Only problem I can find with these books is, the interest rate drops after several reads. I lost this gem in some forsaken abyss in the depths of my pandemoniac room... Man, I could cry right about now :-("
2,unpleasant way to spend money,"I found very little of this book to be amusing. Several pages of this collection attempts to entertain with racist sterotypes, especially portraying South Asians/Indians/Middle Easterners. Borrow this book if you must know what it contains (and don't trust a review, if you so choose...I made that mistake when I purchased this). Some parts are ok, but definitely, nothing fantastic."
1,Horifically Unfunny,"This book is for retarded children. Don't buy it. There were like 2 or 3 funny ones, but otherwise its a complete rip off."
5,really the best,"I've been cooking forever, and still learned so much from this book. I now buy it for all the bridal showers I go to - and this summer that is quite a lot."
3,"Entertaining to read, but recipes are too onerous","Entertaining to read because of the meticulous research that chefs put into each recipe.But recipes are too onerous for me to use. Three page recipe? Come on! I want to enjoy the weekend, not slave away in the kitchen.Still, the recipes make me understand there is a world of difference between Rachel Ray / real working people's cooking versus gourmet cooking.When things taste really good, it is because someone slaved away at it. No pain, no gain."
4,its pretty good......,"this book is a good cook book. it has so many recipes in it... you can find anything. i have made about 10 recipes from this book and they were just okay. i expected them to be WONDERFUl, just because the book says that they have been tested again and again, but they were just so-so. but this book does have a TON of cool and useful information in it, and im in culinary school, and it has helped me to write so many papers."
4,A Must in Everyone's Cookbook Library,"I totally agree with most of the reviewers, this is a very good cookbook! The background for each recipe is very helpful and informative (tells you what WON'T work), the actual instructions are clear and simple, and so far every recipe I've tried has been delicious! Some of my favorites are the french onion soup, corn chowder, and apple crumble. Plus since I'm just starting to cook, I also appreciated the side tips (e.g. best brands for knives, etc.).With all those praises, why 4 instead of a 5? I would have really appreciated pictures! This book only has illustrations and is closer to an encylopedia in terms of format :p"
4,Great Tasting Food,"I had to have this book after eating a fabulous Boston Cream Pie my sister-in-law made, following a recipe from this book. I immediately bought it and made the pie myself. The instructions are very specific and detailed, which is a little frustrating, but I have to say it made for a fabulous Boston Cream Pie! There aren't a whole lot of pictures and there's a lot of writing, but it explains how and why some recipes don't work and others do-which I found interesting. Overall, I am very happy with the book and highly recommend it."
4,Similar and Yet Different,"It seems that books of completely unrelated facts are the new trend in reference books. Like Schott's Miscellany, The Uncyclopedia is a compendium of irreverent facts that any trivia hound will love. However, a lot of the facts found in one can be found in the other. While the similarities are many (such as an incredibly long list of the numbers of ""pi"" and lists of prizes and geographical features), The Uncyclopedia offers readers many unique and intresting facts. A very fun read and very informative."
1,A Final Fantasy FREAK that didn't like this movie at all!,"I'm a HUGE and I mean HUGE Fan of the Final Fantasy Series! As much as I looked forward to this movie, I could almost say I hated it. I wish Square gave it a good story. The movie had no originality and was plain and long........It didn't have the feeling that all the other Final Fantasy games had............"
4,Good but you should buy a wireless one,"This is a great controller if you are one who sits really close to the TV. If you sit far away from the TV, everyone in your house will probably trip over it. It's happened to me many times. If you got this controller with the PS2, keep it as a backup but you should invest in a wireless controller. It will prevent ""catastrofic accidents"". It is, however, easier to use than a wireless controller because sometimes on the wireless ones, the buttons are harder and dont work as well."
2,Used to be good,"I don't know what's the deal with PS2 controllers, the one that came with my old fat model lasted me for a few years and it served me well.But the one that came with my slim model lasted less than a year of use before the left stick got really stiff and squeeky and the directional pad became very loose and moves around.The brand new one I bought earlier this year has already started to get very unresponsive in the pad and the X button both of which I now have to press hard to get them to register.Both of these newer controllers have a crappy start button that only works half the time. I think that Sony started using poor cheap parts in its controllers recently or something."
4,PS 2 Dualshock Controller,This is a must for the PS2 if you don't have it already. It's great for games that involve shock because it gets you more involved with the game. I also like to use the two joysticks for several games which help with certain stimulated moves or events with characters. I think you'll never look at another controller the same for the PS2 when you use this.
1,Frustrated,"I ordered a PS2 Controller a few months ago. When I received it, the ""up arrow"" button on it did not work. When I asked for a replacement controller to be sent it took over 6 weeks to get a reply! Today I just received a box from GadgetGear that contained 2 PS2 Controllers, and iPhone 3G case, a iPod radio transmitter, and a gray cable. Did he ship someone else's order to me? Did he not know what I was asking a replacement for? I'm not happy with the service that I received and I definitely will not be ordering from this guy again. I would recommend the same to you."
1,Sony is equal lousy quality,"Sorry Sony die & blind hards. This is the 3rd controllers we have replaced in a period of 2 years. It just died as if Sony has a deadwish timer chip embedded on it (conspiracy joke OK). Within the same period, probably longer since Halo 1 time, we have all 4 Xbox controllers still working abeit the children uses the Xbox more than the PS2, much more. My personal limited samples of Sony PS2 station and PS controller yield the unshakable verdict within our limited environment between friends & relatives -> Sony sucks in term of quality. Is Deng Xiao Peng CEO of Sony Corp now?"
1,Dose not work,"Delivery was before the time which was good.And the controller was just ""Like new"" .. exept that it (( did'nt work ..!!))What a shock .. "" LIKE NEW "" and "" DOSE NOT WORK "" !!!!"
4,Great quality. Just a bit too small...,"I wish this were the same size as Microsoft's Xbox controller or even some of the 3rd-party PS2 controllers, many of which I've tried and like the way it feels in my hands better, but they just don't hold up to the quality of this Sony model.Perhaps Sony will introduce a slightly larger controller so our hands don't cramp up after way too many hours of gameplaying..."
1,"BEFORE YOU BUY IT, READ THIS!","ok, I got a ps2 for christmas (2003) and i really love it, but thats not why im here. It comes with this controller so i know that it........well sucks, sucks big time, if you love racing games.it has pressure sensetivity, so like playing a racing game its just like a gas peadal, but then again is not. Because if u want to go fast u have to push the button really really hard and i almost broke mine because of it. so if you want somore good advice, go to the ps1 section and buy a ps1 controller, its cheaper and duznt have that gay pressure sensetivity."
5,excellent ps2 controller,bought this controller for my sons ps2. works great. is just like the original one it came with. thank you.
2,button does not work,"I ordered this for my friend and even though it cost a total of about $11 with S&H;, after a week of using it or so, the button stopped working...lol but aside from that, he really liked how it was packaged.. lmao"
3,"Good pan, wrong size","This is an extremely high quality, solid pan. However, there is one problem. It's advertised as being a 9"" tube pan. It is actually 9.5"" (as are almost all the ""10-inch"" tube pans on the market) with the same capacity as my supposed 10"" pan. If you're trying to replace your 10 cup 9"" tube pan for your 1970s recipes, this pan is not the right one."
5,Our first Angel Food cake,"My daughter is learning to cook and was dying to make an angel food cake but we needed a 2-piece pan. After reading all the reviews of various pans available on Amazon, this one seemed to be suitable, of good quality, and with generally good reviews.The pan performed very well. It did not leak or burn and cooked the cake perfectly. We had no problem releasing a perfectly formed cake from the pan.Baking the cake with my daughter was a learning experience. She learned:a) you should not pick up a 2-piece pan from the bottom or the batter will leak all over the floorb) that she really does not like the taste of angel food cake. Even with lots of whipped cream and fresh strawberries.I guess we'll move on to bundt cakes."
5,The Title Says It All!,"Those of us who have spent years struggling with the 'outside fixes' of self-denial, punishing exercise, dieting trying to attain an ""ideal"" image now have the opportunity to learn from the author's experience on her journey within---finding a place of acceptance, love and ultimate healing. PR Huber, Massage Therapist and Certified Personal Trainer, specializing in women and girls with eating dysfunction and body-image issues."
2,Puppy Pads Quality,Have been ordering these pads for the last 6 months from various Amazon vendors but this last purchase the Pads were not of the same quality. The Polymer backing is missing from this batch of pads. Seems like they are totally different than the same pads purchased before. Don't know if the manufacturer changed the pad or someone switched the pad to an inferior one.
4,A Excellent Album Problems Or Not,"I read over the reviews that its not a good mix, or its not really original, whatever the complaint the album is still excellent. I do think that the only flaw is the bonus tracks. I think that most of the tracks are really ordinary & can be found on the 5 CD set Time Traveller or Prelude, and the BBC stuff was available on somewhat questionable collector records, nothing new really. They could have used the track ""Noches De Seda"" (Nights In White Satin) which I have listed on my site on a CD called ""Artifacts"",as a bonus track. Anyhow, people will complain even if the mix was good on the first CD but adding single A & B sides, big deal. So I give it a 4 star due to the fact the bonus CD could have been better.Search ""Judemac Forever"" on msn"
5,Awesome in 5.1 Surround Sound.,"Personally I think the remastering to 5.1 surround sound for this 1967 recording is awesome. You can hear everything clear, and clean, down to the most minute sound. The seperation with vocals, orchestration and instruments is incredible. The 2nd CD is very nicely remastered as well. If you don't have an SACD player, play it in 5 or 7 channel stereo, whatever your receiver will play. It's still awesome to listen to especially if you're a Moody Blues fan."
3,me.turner,I was happy with this at first. Because I downloaded it to my kindle so my son could watch it anywhere. Even if we were not in wi-fi. It worked once and now he can't watch it unless we are in wi-fi range. Sooooo IDK !!
3,Not watched often,"The video was purchased for a five year old who is addicted to Cat Woman. I believe he has watched this through the Kindle Fire less than three times, not the best purchase made."
2,There are no holes in the pan,"I realize the price is exceptional, however, I do expect to get the item that is pictured. There are no holes in the pan I received. It is not dishwasher safe. It does not state that it is but it should tell you that you have to wash it by hand. I am very disappointed and would not have purchased the pan I received had I known what it was beforehand."
5,pure jelly,"What can I say, its pure petroleum jelly, exactly the way you would expect it to be. And vaseline is a trusted brand, so its worth the buy."
4,Nice,"Here's an HP laptop PC that meets minimum standards needed by college-bound high school students.One child in particular hounded me for months; I finally broke down last month and acquired a re-manufactured one of these Compaq Presario's--with the AMD Sempron processor, albeit a smaller 40 megabyte hard drive, and therefore roughly $460.So far, it's been a great, and it will go to college with the kid in a little more than a year. At most, it might need a memory upgrade. But memory cards are so inexpensive these days. It pays to buy the cheaper model with 512mb of memory, buy a new gigabyte card or two, and upgrade manually. It's a cinch."
2,NOT impressed,"I bought this, and HATED IT!!! I LOVE Pilates, but this one sucked. I ended up just going to the class at the YMCA and had the instructor modify for pregnancy. I was hoping to have a video that I could do at home, but this was a giant dissapointment. It is now collecting dust in the back of my DVD collection."
2,rewind and fast forward -not my idea of a workout,"I spent more time stoping to do the excercise after instruction because they don't do the repetition with you. So they explain (some seemingly scary for prenatal)exercise, then go to the transition for the next excercise instead of doing the repeition. Along with not being very up beat or interesting instructors I can't say that it was very motivating. Denise Austin - please put out a DVD for Pilates!"
5,Back In Action,"I love this workout - After having my baby, I was unsure of how i would ever get back in shape - it's so difficult to find time to do anything, let alone exercise..but, Prenatal Pilates did it for me. I am back in shape and feel great...thank you for designing this workout!Lauri Strober"
2,unsatisfied,"This DVD was very disappointing to me. I didn't realize when I purchased it all the things you need to work out with and all the space you need. They require 2 soup cans, blankets and pillows. The worse of all is the space situation. They do most of the exercises against a wall that you need lots of space for. I actually hang pictures and such on my walls and couldn't find a big enough section of my wall with nothing on it or nothing infront of it. Also they don't tell you this but you need to do the floor exercises leaning up against a hard surface like a couch. I have a coffee table infront of my couch and being 7 months pregnant it is solid wood and too heavy to move on my own. And just to add to everything else, the pace of the workouts are very fast. When you are starting out and are not familiar with the exercises it is very hard to keep up with them. They go so quickly from one work out to the next."
5,Absolutely amazing!,"I decided to buy this DVD as soon as I found out that I was pregnant with my third child. I had never done pilates before but am now addicted to it thanks to this video. I had more energy this time around, and I gained 12 pounds less than I did with my first 2 pregnancies--- I attribute completely to doing this exercise program. It was easy to follow and the results were amazing!!!! I am getting ready to start the follow- up DVD, Post-Natal Pilates. I can't wait!"
5,THE BEST!!,Thank you to the creators of Prenatal Pilates! This video helped to keep me motivated and fit during my pregnancy. My body maintained strength and energy when I needed it most! I love it so much it has become my favorite gift to give mothers-to-be.
5,Cleans great for my ruger 10/22.,I like how well it cleans and how quicky and easily it does it. Just drop the little brass weight in and pull it out from the other side. My main reason to get the boresnake is because people say the boresnake is a safer way to clean your gun because you are much less likely to scratch the inside or damage the muzzle from using those popular aluminum connectable cleaning rods. Some people say that the .22 version doesn't work but that is wrong. It definitely fits and works but it takes a little effort to pull it out so use the puller.
1,Stacking Chairs Toy,"I am very disappointed that I have never received the product and received a notice by email that the product was lost in shipping or sent to the wrong address. No one ever called to find out what the right address might be. This product was bought for a birthday and ordered far ahead of time so that it would be here before the birthday. Unfortunately, it was not here in time.I received the notice two weeks after the order saying it was lost and would refund my credit card, not even asking if I still wanted the order. I think that if you state on your delivery service to be 5-7 days that you would call or notify me, as a customer service, if I received my item, which I responded ""no"", but never heard back for another week. Need better response time and better follow up with your customer and shipping service. Amazon should have their outside suppliers or vendors be more responsible."
3,"dont' be fooled, it's still a toy","It looks very nice and shiny. Some keys however fall in and don't pop out well. It also doesn't sound anything like a real piano, still it's just a toy."
2,"a good writer, but does she have enough experience?","When I first saw this book and read the reviews I felt that no publisher would spend this much and produce a book that looked this good unless it was either written by someone who knew what she was writing about, or made it clear that her ideas were only opinions, not based firmly on real hard earned experience. A three year sailing experience limited to one boat does not seem to make this woman an expert - especially on the matter of real seamanship, heavy weather, and such. I'd say this is a good look at a really easy voyage using the trade winds, not too much happened to test the people or boat. But it definitely is not a handbook and people looking for real serious seamanship advise should look elsewere. I did agree with many of the ideas presented here, just wish the author had stuck to what she really knew, not tried to write the complete handbook. voyage."
4,Worth reading,"This author has copped criticism for being an inexperienced ""yuppie"" whose early lifestyle - a lifestyle she now decries as meanginless - helped pay for some easy cruising. This opinion is small minded. The simple fact the book is written by an honest woman gives it a rare and compelling resonance. Any man trying to honestly sell the cruising dream and any woman seeking a fair appraisal of what to expect from that dream will benefit from Bluewater Cruising. Does this book cover its topic exhaustively leaving no stone unturned? Not always - but none truly do. Does the book present our favourite subject in a different and useful way? Yes, I believe it does."
4,I couldn't give it five stars because...,"HER HAIR!!! Madison is always so pretty and in this one I love her outfits and everything she comes with, but her hair is so weird! I mean what's with the baby bangs? They should've given her hair sorta like Dressed to Impress. That's my oppinion.P.S. Madison is NOT Italian! She's totally African-American! Even My Scene.com would say that!Thanx for reading#1 My Scene fan"
5,"Great novel, very much a book of the nineties.","This book is very well written. I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for a good novel. It has a mysterious appeal to it. From the first page, to the last page, this book will definately keep you interested. It has a action filled plot with many twists and turns that make you have to keep reading. David Thiele is the up and coming John Grisham of the next century."
5,Finding Your True Love In Yourself,"A simple but deeply provoking book on the nature of self-love, self-esteem, and making peace with our past and our inherited patterns from our biological family of origin. Written by Hoffman Process teachers, Journey into Love explains the origins of psychic pain and a path to healing that cuts to the core emotional wounds that drive compulsive negative patterns to sabotage our happiness. A great guidebook for Hoffman Process graduates and those who are currently committed to truly healing very old childhood wounds once and for all. Healing is something only YOU can do for YOURSELF. No one else. Facilitators come along to grant support and help teach you tools and bring blind spots to your attention. But in the end ... only you can make yourself happy, whole, and complete ...NOT perfect. Everyone is a work in progress either to evolution or devolution. A Journey into Love is a choice that demands courage to evolve and love yourself 100%."
5,You need this book!,"This is one of the few books which I regard as a bible in the world of sewing and fashion design. I was a clothing designer in the garment industry for 15 years and am now a professor of fashion design. I tell my students that they need to own this book if they are at all interested in continuing in the business of making clothes. This answers all those questions about how to handle, construct, and use different materials and fabrics."
2,"Worth a look, but nothing shocking","This was a very fast, easy read, but not too thrilling or suspensefull. The first half was way too slow, but the ending was interesting, although predictable. A good book to read for fun and relaxation, but nothing very stimulating here."
2,have seen better,I was interested in these gloves because the image shows them to have a much longer cuff than they really do.the cuff on these just covers your wrist bone I was expecting another couple inches. the gloves seem to be of usable quality the material feels sticky compaired to other black nitrile gloves I have reviewed.the sizing runs about average.
5,The Best There Is,"If this lady is not the ""Patsy Cline of Bluegrass"" I don't know who is. While Alison Krauss and Rhonda Vincent may be considered the ""standards"" for today's Progressive Bluegrass sound, nobody, and I mean nobody, can do more with a voice than Claire Lynch. She is amazing with her range flexibility and the tonal quality of her voice is haunting. Practically every cut on this new CD is great, although I'm not particularly drawn to ""Western Swing"", which she has included in the last couple of CD's .... the track on this one is ""Fallin in Love"". The rest are fantastic .... ""Be Ready to Sail"", the driving ""White Train"" and my favorite ""I Believe in Forever"". She's actually topped herself on this one. Buy it ... you'll see."
1,This book sucks,The author rambles on and on about things that have nothing to do with the subject of that chapter. It's written horribly!
5,GREAT STORAGE PIECE,"I really like how this has cleaned up my laundry room! Although relatively easy to assemble, I thought the doors were a bit difficult to get on. The top piece seemed to be a little 'caved in', but after a little struggle, I was able to get the pieces to fit together. I also like how the doors have slides at the top and bottom to keep the doors closed. Roomy interior...I was able to organize my everyday items well, and still have room to add things as they are needed. Overall, very happy with this unit."
1,DON'T FALL FOR IT!,"Zero-out-of-Five stars... (Actualy, more like negative-seven-out-of-five) Do not be misled into thinking this is a book. Far from it. This is an eight page spiral bound pamphlet, along with a few more pages of ads and jokes. And eight pages is a lot more then this stuff deserves. Please let me save you a little money...HOW TO HELP A WOMAN HAVE AN ORGASM: ....Tell her to have an orgasm.HOW TO GIVE A SWEDISH BREAST MASSAGE: ....Use a lot of oil. Rub her breasts a lot. Save the nipples for last.p>You now know as much about women as Phil Gur.Good luck."
3,Barely okay,"The first problem I have is that the Emergency Alarm for personal protection should not be on a unit for animal control. The very first thing that happened? My wife hit the wrong button and scared all of us half to death. The other, bigger, problem is the unit isnt powerful enough. It barely works on our dogs and to keep it effective for ""barely"" we have to use it way more sparingly than we could have imagined thus making it useless most of the time in trying to train our dogs into not barking so much at random sounds. Given the knowledge, based on experience now, I would have tried one of their other products, hoping it was more powerful."
3,"Good rides, crummy book.","I have to say this book is packed with a bunch of great rides, for day trippers from Chicago or folks who live in the area and want some new rides this is a great resource. Some pretty cool spots are called out too.Here are my gripes... The book is just really poor quality and would not survive a handful of trips in my saddle bags. All the travel books I have bought are built tough with a nice sturdy cover and thick pages so it would take a beating, this book feels like it was made at Kinkos or by someone who took a night school class on book binding. The pages are thin and the spiral binding is plastic junk. Really not trying to be mean, but I've spent half as much on nicer quality map books. Also, being a man who appreciates a book that was designed by someone who understands typography I can say the person who did this book does not. They used Comic Sans for the introduction...It's a Mickey Mouse quality book, but the rides are fun."
4,Great guide,I bought this book (for about half of retail) when I bought a Garmin GPS that is programmable using map source.(Re-manufactured from a different web site) Sunday Rides are great and the author's (Barber Barber)knowledge of the area make the rides more enjoyable.The combination of both items has made motorcycling even better.Thanks Barbara
2,Nice but Pricey,"Very heavy duty, I installed this on my friends wall and it is HARDCORE!! You could mount any TV you wanted on this thing, but it is over kill for most TV's. My buddy was mounting a 58"" and for that it was great for."
2,Well um ..............,"Took it out of the box .... and was not impressed. Well let me explain a little more .... my TV is a 58 inch plasma, and quite frankly I do not care what they say this TV will hold, I was NOT risking my new TV with this product ......... no way.I sent it backBUT hey maybe it is good for a small TV, but nothing too big IMO"
3,Seems Fine,Decided not to wall mount in my apartment as I am moving soon. Product arrived on time and seems to be in perfect working condition.
4,Well worth the cost...,"The product is well-constructed and fits the bill with our Element 32"" LCD HDTV. Installation was easy and well-documented. The addition of the locking bar (on the model we received) was an added value that insures your HDTV doesn't walk away. All hardware was included and ready to install on studs. Recommended!"
4,butterfly screws recommended.,"I am most please with this item. Very nice. Ultra slim, not too bulky. Only problem I found that I had to add some butterfly screws to make sure it was well secured to the wall. Otherwise It was worth the price."
2,Translation is disappointing,"I'm Russian myself, and I wanted to find a good translation so that my husband could read the stories I was telling him about for himself. Boy, was it disappointing. I guess I thought if the translator had a Russian name, she'd know what she was talking about. I actually had to comment on every passage, so it would make sense to an English-speaking reader while it still preserved the essence of the story. I could probably do it better myself.As far as Gogol is concerned - these Ukrainian stories stories are magical. Great reading on a December night, when the snow is falling, and you're curled up with a cup of hot tea on a couch, while the rest of the house is dark..."
3,A Legands Short Stories,This book contains the short works of a legendary Russian writer. I was disapointed by these works. They were not entertaining or worth the time to read them.
4,Planetarium visit (but way better) via your bluray player,"This was great fun for us planetarium geeks who enjoy watching dvds about the unuverse, galaxies, planets, stars, etc. Format is a journey you take outwards from Earth. Interesting facts, beautiful video and computerized images too. Very pleasant and relaxing video. Alec Baldwin has a pleasant voice for narration. Overall...enjoyed the video very much! Looking forward to watching it again.This would be a great educational tool as well. Plenty of useful facts and thoughtful comments to work with."
4,Disc Won't Play on my Oppo BDP-93,"I enjoyed what I could view of the ""Journey"", but the picture kept breaking up as if it were scratched or something? This is the first Blu-Ray title my Oppo BDP-93 could not play without issue; I tried 3 different copies!Visuals were otherwise very nice as was Alec Baldwin's narration. This journey is not intended as a fluff piece, but aimed to give you nonstop content along the way."
5,takes you there,"A wonderful combination of actual pictures coming from a myriad of real sources and realistic animation based on real science obtained from the locations. The landscape zooms actually take you there (to the sun, planets and asteroids, and more). The deep space shots are beautiful."
2,Alec Baldwin - Don't give up your day job,I was so looking forward to this BluRay. It should have been a spectacular production in line with most of National Geographic's work but the commentary by Alec Baldwin just completely ruins the production. The production itself is a mixture of science and conjecture but the commentary - well the Attenboroughs and Dimbelbys have nothing to worry about -. Baldwin can't hold a candle to them. The narrative is incredulous and completely spoils what should have been a very good production.
3,Good but not great,The computer graphics were outstanding and made the HD images come alive however the disk was hampered by the dumbed down narrative which was directed toward someone with a fourth grade education. Baldwin was simply bad--you could see he did not understand what he was reading and probably did not care. There are so many outstanding men and women in the field who live this journey that to put someone from Hollywood to do the part was a crying shame.
2,Not very informative and Alec Baldwin sucks.,"This video has nice computer generated special effects. That's the good part. There is not really any useful info or actual scientific data. It's a story for a child. I also really cant stand Alec ""The Ego"" Baldwin. I think national Geographic dropped the ball on the narration and really should of made this video much more informative about the universe. Thanks."
1,"Scientifically, the content WAS accurate at one time . . .","National Geographic sells this video as ""the first accurate non-stop voyage from Earth to the edge of the Universe."" This is bad science and hucksterism at their worst. While their voyage scenarios are initially based on Hubble images of space over millions of years ago, keep in mind that National Geographic revised them to whatever THEY DECIDED what the current actual reality should be. Since nothing in space and time are static, a real voyage from Earth to the edge of the Universe would be nothing like the fantasy existence National Geographic is trying to sell in this video. Of course no one would buy any of these videos if National Geographic provided the disclaimer they are merely guessing as to what the voyage to the edge of the Universe would be like. This is worse than bad science, it is fake science. Buyer Beware!"
1,Alec Baldwin? please...,"I would really like to buy/view this DVD as I'm sure the scientific and visual content is superb. But, the prospect of listening to a ""character"" like narrator Alec Baldwin for an hour is too much to stomach. Attention National Geographic: there are lots of great science and nature narrators out there. Why choose Alec Baldwin? He is divisive and lacks credibility with at least 48% of the populace. Bad move National Geographic. I'll buy it used, and watch it on mute."
3,Do you believe in shame? cd single,"I think i've figured out the flaw on The Singles 86-04: (Disc 06) Do You Believe In Shame? (Cd Single) track 2 The Krush Brothers LSD Edit. it is actually the songs from the big thing cd tracks 11 & 12 ""the edge of america"" (cd track length 2:37) & ""lake shore driving"" (cd track length 3:03) combined was an edit. the track on the singles is 3:30. so, i've entered the song in my music collection database as this ""The Edge Of America / Lake Shore Driving (The Krush Brothers LSD Edit)"". I think that's the closest to the actual title as i can get. just an fyi."
3,good but not great,i have lost so much memory with these memory card. lost files and when lost the memory will say corrupt you will not be able to delete believe me i tried. other then that they are good.
2,TEST YOUR PRODUCTS!!!,"To all that purchase pre-owned products. Please make sure you know the item works, so you do not have to return it. This memory card that I just bought does not even work. I just had to go buy another one that actually does. I would advise that you purchase through a Amazon fulfilled vendor and not anyone else. My kid was so upset at the fact that this item didnt work."
2,Overpriced!!!,"I am not the first ( and probably not the last) to say this but this is expensive. Sony sells 8Mb memory sticks for a fraction of the price( infact you can get 32Mb memory sticks for the same price and they must be harder to make because their smaller about 1/6 the size) what sony should have done is what they do for every other computer device they make and put a memory stick slot(of course they need the memory card slot for the backwards compatablility and all but make new memory cards and try and sell them for that much that's a ...!!! and anybody with a PS2 has to put up with it, or not save their game."
4,memory card,"The PS2 memory card isn't bad, it as stated before lacks the ability to save PS1 titles and vice versa but that is ok i guess. i've never had any problems with these memory cards myself(and i own and have used alot of these cards).The PS1 cards however, i've had some corruptions for no aparent reason(i don't pull the memory cards out while the system is on or anything). Glad it was fixed in the newer cards though."
3,PS2 Memory Card,I gave this as a gift...not sure how it works but have received no negative feedback so far.
3,agradecido,me llego el producto en buen estado todo gracias por confiar en ustedes lo estoy usando no me ha dado ningun problema espero comprarles algo pronto
2,"cake sticks, the surface peels, and the pan rusts","The first couple of times the pan was nice and the cake came out fine and pretty, but then the surface started to peel, and the cake started to stick to the pan, and it is very hard to get out, which leads to even more scratches, and I was using nylon spatula to get it out. Also, it rusts where the scratches are. I replaced it with Nordicware pan which is cast aluminum, and at least I am not in danger of it rusting. Cakes just pop out of that pan, and I am so happy."
2,"Nice pan, crazy instructions for care and handling","I bet no one reads the instructions that come with this thing, but I did, and they make no sense. For example, ""We recommend that you hand wash your bakeware...however it can be cleaned in the dishwasher if necessary...DO NOT IMMERSE OR SOAK your insulated bakeware.Nice work guys...I am pretty sure a dishwasher is going to immerse it in water and probably soak it to some degree.Another example, You may use spray oils with your bakeware...However, DO NOT USE SPRAY OILS TO COOK IN ANY CUISINART COOKWARE ITEMS.Idiots."
5,Lb BAck,"Wow this is a masterpeace.First i heard of tha lost boys by listening to wanna get paid by ll cool j.I loved that song.then, one year later i bought the kid capri album with the song ""loud and clear"" wich was the best song i've ever heard. i bought both of da lost boyz albums and they were great.But the new album is not as good as the last two because without freaky tah the lb sounds totally different."
5,Great cd phat beats,R.I.P TAH this was a great cd with awesome beats and alot of heart. This was a great tribute to Freaky Tah
1,GARBAGE,"DO NOT BUY. This is GARBAGE carelessly and thoughtlessly made in China. There is NO Quality Control involved. The amber cone described is nowhere to be seen. The 4-in-1 emergency light has only three functions. In fact, the emergency light worked for less than one (1) minute before it shorted out. The air gauge does NOT work. The compressor is so underpowered that it will have NO effect on an automobile tire. Shame on this so-called ""American Company"" for selling such garbage. Shame on Amazon."
2,boo this camera... BOOO,"i bought this camera because i was told that for a 'first timer' this is one to have. the quality of pictures if you zoom is horrible. its unbelievably slow, you tend to miss the shot or people get tired of waiting. and if you dont have the rechargeable battery, its impossible to find the disposable version. save up your money, buy one that will give you the quality that you really want. big time thumbs down."
4,"Very Good Budget 27""","Panablack tube is really very good. Very bright picture and the tube has very little curve or bubble out. Reds are a bit on the hot side, but this could be due to my new Time Warner Digital Cable. Color Temp. feature is very helpful. Nice layout and really a good looking TV set. Excellent value. DVD's look fantastic on this set."
1,This book belongs in the dustbin,This book falls into the category of the worst purchases I have ever made. Most of the information is 'cut and paste' accompanied by obsolete photos. Jon Lake's credibility has taken a hit as far as I am concerned with this publication.
5,Very Cute Rain Gauge,"My husband works for John Deere Landscapes. We are avid gardeners and this rain gauge looks really cute in our butterfly garden. It's bright, sturdy and well-made."
2,Did not work correctly,Device would not remain synced for more than 2 minutes. It would setup then it would lose the link and I would have to remove the batteries to reset. The sending unit was only 2 feet from the receiver so distance was not the issue. I purchased for thanksgiving so I just used my trusty meat thermometer instead. I would not recommend this as the first choice for reliability.
1,Extremely POOR QUALITY,"This thermometer worked great two times. On the third time I used it the device ceased to receive the temperature on the digital read-out. The warranty expired 30 days prior to the thing dying. It's made in China, and seems to be a p.o.s. quality-wise. Thanks, Oregon Scientific!"
3,"Nice construction, but inaccurate after 3 uses","Beautifully built, solid, great range, but on third use the temperature was at least 40 degrees away from two other traditional thermometers. Probe fails early. I wonder if the probe is unable to tolerate the high heat phase of grilling and smoking?"
2,Taz,"Oregon Scientific AW131 Grill Right Wireless Talking BBQ/Oven ThermometerPurchased this unit as a christmas gift and the unit didn't work correctly out of the package.emailed Oeregon Scientific for help and as of today NO Response from them.Tells me they don't care about their customers after the purchase.Sensor probe doesn't work correctly, does not read remote temperatures.Wouldn't recommend on because of this issue and the lack of customer service from Oregon Sciantific."
1,Did not work,"I got this as a gift for my Mom. Bottom line, three competent adults could not get it to function properly. We used both reset buttons, tried fresh batteries, even took it outside to see if some other electronics were interferring with the signal. The thermometer readings are consistently up in the 200-500 degree range while at room temperature. We're terribly dissappointed and looking for a different brand."
1,Terrible waste of money,"What can I say, this product never worked properly. The unit would turn on, but despite my best efforts, thorough reading of the manual, etc, would not register temeratures (at all, ever)......but here's the kicker; I REPEATEDLY attempted to contact Oregon Scientific....NO RESPONSES. NONE. As far as I'm concerned, this unit should be considered warranty-less, as there is simply NO CUSTOMER SERVICE TO BE FOUND from Oregon Scientific. I hate to tell people not to buy based on a solitary defective unit, but coupled with Oregon Scientific's baffling refusal to even respond to customer inquiries, I'd have to suggest steering clear of this unit, or being prepared to live with the consequences if you get one of the defective units."
3,Synchin transmitter and base unit,"Same problem as others, but did reset both units at same time and it now works. Tried calling the 800 number, but apparently not a working number....they don't want to hear about the problems?"
2,Do not buy if you want some to work consistently,A number of post out there mentioning these do not sync consistently. Manual has no troubleshooting guidelines. Had to read through a number of reviews to find the solution. Only used my AW131 twice and now I need to remove batties every time to sync unit. I am amazed by how many people gave this a 5 star rating. Issue seems pretty consistent. Will sent OS a message letting them know my dissatisfaction.
5,Works better than I thought,"I live in a 3 level 4 plex on a military base. The wireless transmitter works beautifully, two levels down and the receiver has no problem getting the signal anywhere in the house. It comes with presets temps, or you can set it to a temp you want. Like set it to 182 degrees for a brisket. Gives you a warning when the food is ""almost done"" that I found very nice. I recommend it to anyone."
1,Not very good,"Thanksgiving a.m. and I tried to use this and it didn't work. I read the instructions 20 times but couldn't get it to work. Went to the OS web site but nothing helpful. I finally read comments on Amazon.com about resetting both units at the same time, which got it to work, finally. Amazing that there is nothing about it in the instructions. I went about 30 feet from the kitchen and sometimes the connection failed and I had to go back and wait for it to reconnect. When it works it's fine, but if I had the option I'd buy something easier to use."
3,wireless thermometer,"Not very happy with the product. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't! The last one I had , lasted about a year and a half. It would show the temp as 170 degrees before I even put it in the meat."
1,Junk. Don't waste your money.,"This item never worked from day 1. The instructions are insufficient, and contain no troubleshooting assistance whatsoever. Seriously, this thermometer doesn't do a thing. Unfortunately because I gave this as a gift, it is now no longer eligible for a full refund, and not worth the hassle for a partial one."
2,Is there a quality remote digital thermometer produced today?,"Apparently not. After reading horror stories about other models, I chose this one. This has it's issues like the rest. When starting the receiver can not find the signal. This requires you to reset the receiver and transmitter. Even then, it loses the signal once in a while from 15ft away (and through 1 wall).The trasmitter send a signal for only one probe, unlike some models. The one sensor it came with crapped out after only one month. This was only after four uses at temperatures well under the rated maximum of 392F. There is no excuse for this. I had to buy another on Oregon's website, and pay them $10 shipping. They probably made $9 profit right there."
1,Failed giving way wrong temperatures,"Great idea, but unit kept giving me the wrong temperatures what I tried to cook so meat never came out right.Could not easily return as I live outside the US. Bought a replacement probe but this made no difference.Finally replaced w/ a simple instant thermometer.dumped this thermometer"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"Don't buy this or any other wireless unit. Get a wired unit or just a regular meat therm. This piece of crap worked twice and then I couldn't get the two units to talk to each other. Did the battery thing, the reset thing and finally after 9 or 10 tries, the transmitter and receiver started talking to each other. That was only half the problem. When I plugged the probe into the base unit inside my 70 degree house, it immediately read 175 degrees F. Nothing I did would change that. My feeling is that the probe is shot. After only two uses, the probe is shot? Are you kidding me? I use my thermometers for low and slow, so the probe could not and should not burn out after two uses. No freakin way I am sending this company any more money to replace the probe. Yea, it's probably under warranty still but I have no idea where my receipt is. Read the 1,2 and 3 star reviews here BEFORE you hit the ORDER CONFIRMATION button. I can almost guarantee you won't buy this."
2,icookalot,"Product worked properly for about 3 weeks, and now is unusable and terribly incorrect in temperature accuracy.The product requires a total reboot (removal of batteries and multi reset button) each time you try to sync it with the remote.Still searching for one that works."
5,Recomended,This is my third wireless thermometer. I use them on my grill which can easily destroy regular kitchen types. This one has held up great and is much more durable in its construction.
4,Great!,"I purchased this unit this summer (08) to use with my new Holland grill. The unit works great. I have not had a bad meal with it yet. Have used it about 20 times on Turkey, Chicken, Fish, and Steak. Read other reviews before I purchased it, and was a little concerned about some of them that said they could not get the units to ""talk to each other"". I have not had any problems. One improvement to recommend though. The timer function should have a quick reset button so you dont have to push multiple buttons to get back to zero. Otherwise, I am completely happy."
4,reset,The product works fine when you figure out how operate it. After a lot of frustration trying to activate the thing it occured to me to push the reset button on the receiver and the sender at the same time. Worked like a charm.
1,Is This a Toy?,"We rec'd this in August, and set it aside to start using later, as our present thermometer was about to be retired. Tried to start using the new one around Thanksgiving time. It has never worked. There are at least three of us who have tried to figure it out, but no luck! Not sure if we can reach the mfgr at this point, but I want to try. Money down the drain. . . . ."
5,Awesome product!!,"I am someone that really enjoys cooking. I do however like to multitask, with this thermometer I don't have to stand around keeping any eye on my food. The wireless unit enables me to go about doing other things while giving me an accurate temperature reading of my food. I would highly recommend this product to anyone from novice to expert cooks alike."
2,Not consistent,"If only the thermometer performed as good as it looks. Cooking temps seem to be anywhere from 20-30 degrees off. I've used mine several times and it's only been accurate once. I've come to accept the only feature that I'll use while grilling is the stop watch, or get into the hockey puck business with my well done steaks/burgers!"
1,good idea; terrible execution,"I have two of these, and they are both junk. I bought the first in 2010 because the idea of wireless grilling thermometers is brilliant. But the unit would crash periodically, requiring manually resetting of both the sender and receiver and lots of prayer that their wireless would reconnect. Finally the probe stopped working so i bought another a couple months ago. The new receiver unit won't turn on unless you push the tiny reset button in the battery compartment; that reset, in turn, requires resetting the transmitting unit as well. What's so hard about making a product that works?"
2,Unexpected Features make this Player a Loser,"I've had this CD player for over a year now, and it works OK, but I am pretty sick of a few of its unexpected ""features"", namely: (1) You have the volume on 3 while you listen to a CD. Then, you turn the player off. Then, you turn the player back on, but when it plays again, it plays at volume 13 for no apparent reason. Meanwhile, your ears get an unexpected blast. (2) You insert a new CD into the player and hit the play button. For no apparent reason, the player starts playing track #7 instead of track #1. (3) You play a CD with the bass-boost ""off"". Then, you turn the player off. Then, you turn the player back on again. You guessed it -- for no apparent reason, the bass-boost is now on."
3,Very nice non-progressive DVD player. Nice feature set.,"Overall, I am quite happy with my DVD-RV32. Very nice feature set, component outputs, etc. Even though I do not have an HD monitor, and therefore do not require progressive outputs, it still does a great job.I do not understand a previous reviewer who returned it because it was not progressive. Well, duh. It was not advertised as such, and unless he has an HD monitor, it is pointless to have a progressive player. And considering the prices dropping on progressive players, by the time an HD monitor is gotten a better progressive DVD player can be had for very little. There is no need to ""buy ahead"" now with DVD players.So, if you still have a standard 4:3 interlaced set and want a nice DVD player to go with it, check this one out. It can be found quite inexpensively."
2,Just notice I got the same problems,My dvdplayer die after two year of use. It got the same problem as others mentioned. Thanks for the tips.The dvd player works well when it works. I will never buy panasonic again because of this HO7 problem.
1,First my Panasonic TV and now my DVD player....Another ho7!!!!!!!!!!!,"I've had it for almost 3 years and was very happy with it until it died today, but even my old crappy RCA DVD player lasted almost this long.I would've expected a Panasonic player to last at least 5 years. Nope. Stupid motor is crapping out. Could pay $35 for a new motor on their site but it would most likely die with the same problem. Tried the WD40 fix, but it only worked for 10 minutes before displaying the ""HO7"" error again. I'll try one more time, then I'll be forced to buy a quality player(meaning not from Panasonic.)And now my Panasonic TV is having issues with the RCA inputs.Thanks Panasonic!"
3,Unfortified,"Amazon has since removed its description of this dried milk as an ""excellent"" source of vitamin D, but alas vitamins A+D are still lacking. Unless you take a multi-vitamin I suggest the Saco brand, which is properly fortified and in my opinion tastes better."
3,Perfect gift for anyone!,"I gave this to my girlfriend for her present and she loves it. Not only is it huge, but it keeps her quite warm because its so furry. The (price) for the gift wrap is definately worth it cause its so huge and its no paper, but vinyl material and anyone recieving it would be very impressed. The price is very good campared to toy stores like FAO and the quality is flawless, and (limited promotion)free shipping!!"
4,Excellent system--except for one point,"This is an excellent system, incredible sound, easy setup. But there is a glaring omission. No digital audio input for digital cable or satellite. Just analog. That means you cannot experience full 5.1 surround on digital cable or satellite, just DVD."
1,avoid this system,"i bought one of these (not from amazon.com), i should add) and a week out of warranty, it stopped playing DVDs. a few months later it stopped playing even CDs, rendering it completely useless. it's now nothing more than the most expensive radio i've ever bought. i've also found out that this is a common problem, so i'd avoid this system altogether if i were you."
3,Good but Dry,"This book gives information on British calvery and artilllery units from about 1740 to 1790. It deals with troops in the seven years war, India, American revolotion, and Jacobite rebelions. The pictures and illustrations are good. The info is good and accurate. One problem is the writing is very dry. I've read many Osprey books but this is the dullest. I also wish the author had given information on Loyalists units in America."
4,Computer Clean Up,"It is a great gadget to keep the tower off the floor, allowing for easy moving and cleaning without sticking to carpet or scratching a wood floor. And it is lightweight and looks especially fashionable with a black tower (think Dell)."
5,"Simple, Cheap and Functional","A simple no bell and whistles keyboard that has a good price and replaces the mini fisher price keyboards that dell included in some of it's packaged computers. They keys are where they are supposed to be and a simple turning it upside down releases all the food, muck and other ""things"" that end up in keyboards. Trouble free and good feel on the fingertips."
4,Beautiful patterns...,"A very nice book of art nouveau patterns...many of the patterns are large/complicated, but it does have some patterns that are doable for less experienced crafters. The only flaw in the book is that it doesn't have black/white images to accompany the full-color images, which means you'll have to scan it into Photoshop and fuss with it a bit to get a simple/crisp printable pattern."
2,"Not user friendly, there are better choices","I bought this player at Costco under the CV-37 model number. It immediately aggravated me with an extremely poor user interface. The remote is difficult to use, and there are virtually no buttons on the unit. It takes 5 seconds for the unit to ""boot up"" to where it will take a command (like ""disc skip"" or ""open tray""). I was also amazed at how difficult it was to play a CD on random play. It requires an arcane sequence of button pushes on the remote that you will surely forget between uses (and I am an electrical engineer).I just took mine back to Costco and am now shopping for a new player that handles CD's better since this is how I use it 80% of the time. Oh, I almost forgot. The last straw was I rented a movie with some minor scratches and it wouldn't play it! I take the movie back to the store, they put it into their machine, and it played fine!"
2,not much there...even for die hard Met fans,"An uneven collection of small articles about Met history compiled as a book. This book will only appeal to die-hard Mets fans who will read anything with a Met logo on it. It covers the Mets entire history, but is heavily biased toward the early years with almost nothing after 2000. The 2000 World Series is hardly mentioned. Most serious fans will already know most of what is in this book.Several Mets favorites, like Howie Rose and Gary Carter were interviewed for the book. They are mentioned constantly and always in a positive light. Other Mets like Mike Piazza, and Daryl Strawberry, who was not interviewed for the book, are barely a footnote. I was able to get through the book in about two hours. While there was a few interesting facts, there was nothing that was Amazin."
3,Not Enough,"This book had some good stories and was a quick read, but to barely mention Mike Piazza doesn't make any sense. He was the face of the franchise and led them to the subway series in 2000. The book mentions him in passing and basically notes that he wasn't a good fielder. Strawberry is hardly mentioned as well. It makes no sense."
4,Exceptional Shipping - Great Shoe,"Shoe is exactly like the picture. Amazons Shipping was Excellent, brought on 25/07 received on 30/07.It was a gamble getting size 11 as that's my normal shoe size. Shoes fits good would possibly be better a half size down.Packaging was good, only minor tear in the shoe box itself.Will be definitely be getting more."
5,Like walking on a cloud,"Never owned but always wanted a pair of Wallabees, got turned off when Wu Tang Clan was painting them to match their outfits, finally got a pair and wish I had a long time ago.I did have to buy a half size smaller, but because I did, the fit is perfect, I don't wear them (or any shoe) everyday so I expect to have these the rest of my life.I am very happy with the shoes, the seller and my purchase overall."
4,Great shoes but color was off of pic,These shoes came in great shape and quickly. The color was not as dark brown as shown in pic on line. I bought 2different pair before I had to go to a shoe store near me to view the colors in person. I returned them both and bought at store.
5,"A Must Have, light, easy to read, and very helpful.","This book is definately a must have for anyone who cross dresses or is interested or seeking the subject. I wish I'd had this book years ago when I was struggling. I found so much of the book to be true (things I learned the hard way and had to nod my head to), and yet still found many many things to be helpful that I never knew. There's a great resource listing at the end as well. Charles (Julia), without getting into psycho-babble, presents the reader with thought provoking questions concerning the subject that I found not only helpful in understanding myself, but also helpful in understanding what aspects of cross dressing are most important to me. This is an easy to read, fun, humorous, ""no rules"" book. I highly recommend it."
4,Interesting and relevant,"More appropriate title could have been... ""How to crossdress in 10 Minutes..."" or so..!!!This book actually is like Memoirs of the author and his own techniques and tools to crossdress without much of fuss and hassle.The book does provide few good tips and in certain places it becomes a guide telling you the options you have to do a specific thing.Overall, interesting and good to read.. while the title could have been more relevant.. I feel any crossdresser given an opportunity is most active and happy to dressup instead of feeling lazy about it..Recommended but not to be taken very seriously."
3,"Good, but not good enough","Not a bad book for those interested in the work ethic of cross-dressers. My own preference would be to find out what makes a hard-working person tick: ambition? greed? peer pressure? Those who really like this book may also enjoy ""Torpid Transvestism"""
3,IT's Not a comic,"This book is actually the screen play for the film. It is not a comic book. If you are looking for the actual comic, look elsewhere."
5,John's best release yet!,"I have every CD John has released, and love the rest, but feel this one rises above them. John's voice sounds even richer and fuller than in the past. From song 1 to song 11, WILDEST DREAMS is full of songs with real meaning and the emotion that John is know for putting into his music. Just really listen to SALVATION, RESCUED ME or RIVERS IN THE CLOUDS and you'll see how moving this CD really is."
5,THE SONGS IN THIS ALBUM SHOW JOHN'S GREAT VOCAL RANGE!!!!!,"I DISAGREE THAT THIS ALBUM IS BAD....I HAVE LISTENED TO MY TAPE OVER AND OVER AND HAVE FOUND ALSOLUTELY NOTHING MISSING. JOHN HAS SUCH VOCAL RANGE THAT HE CAN TACKLE SUCH SONGS WITH EASE. IT ALSO PROVES THAT JOHN COULD EASILY, IF HE CHOSE TO, MAKE THE CROSSOVER TO THE POP CHARTS. I AM NOT SAYING THAT HE SHOULD, BECAUSE I LOVE HIM AS A COUNTRY ARTIST. WE SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT HE CHOSES TO SHARE HIS VOCAL TALENT WITH ALL OF US. EACH SONG HAS A SPECIAL MEANING, AT LEAST FOR THIS FAN IT DOES. GIVE THE MAN A CHANCE TO FULFIL HIS ""WILDEST DREAMS""!!!!"
1,"Berry, Berry disappointing!!","I've enjoyed all of John Berry's past records, but he lost me on this one. The musical sound is very different from his others -- it's not an improvement, either! I hope he thinks about what he wants to do with his career. He hasn't had a hit record in a long time; this type of album won't change that!"
1,Choose a different product,Maybe I was a bit rough on it but the tap broke on the first hole in soft aluminum only 4mm deep. I think it needs to be made of a stronger material for such a thin tap. I have ordered a replacement from a different supplier.
3,"Good, but not great.","The headphones and the car charger seem to work about average, but the leather cover is almost useless. It doesn't quite fit the phone, you have to force it in and it covers the lens, so you have to take it off to take pictures, kind of an annoyance. But if you really want to keep your phone covered up, it's pretty much the only one that you can buy. At least from what I can tell from the searches I've done."
2,Not the best,"The size is nice and it is fairly simple to use.Although it's not exactly a dinosaur camera, it did not deliver the quality I anticipated. It's a Samsung so I was expecting great performance. A little disappointed."
2,Samsung Digimax A402,I have been very disappointed with the quality of pictures that camera has taken. They are consistently blurry. I had another Samsung Digimax product previously that I loved which was why I purchased another Samsung product. This new Samsung Camera is very inferior to the previous one.
5,The clearest book written about Zen and Buddhism.,"Zen Master Seung Sahn is one of the clearest zen teachers of our time. The Compass of Zen guides the reader from the beginning of Buddhism to Hinayana, Mahayana, and finally Zen. Understanding the path of each vehicle is easy after reading this book! Zen Master Seung Sahn gives the reader the tools necessary to start their own zen practice. Once you have read the book it is your choice. What are you going to do?"
2,"poor tutorial, but good overview of cocoa and carbon","This book starts with a short primer on RealBasic. The second section is a tutorial. The tutorial is poorly explained, however. As a complete beginner, I found complex code with no explanation and often ""magic code."" Magic code appears in the project without ever being introduced in the tutorial. There are multiple errors in the tutorial as well. I guess it is good practice to be able to debug on your own.Finally, the tutorial uses very few of the techniques available to RealBasic. The tutorial that comes with RealBasic is much better.The last few chapters talk about Cocoa and Carbon and give a very good overview, but this space could have been used to make the tutorial much better."
4,Baking,"Purchased this because baking is becoming a new hobby, and I've been collecting and reading cookbooks. Messed up the chocolate layer cake by tying to use artificial sweetener. The cookies are awesome. Planning on trying the bread in the near future."
5,best baking ever,"Amazing illustrated baking techniques. First time i baked a batch of cookies that were perfect in every sense of the word. And to boot, the recipe was easy and delicious! Bye Bye over cooked, dry, burnt cookies. This is now my go to book for all that is baking.Baking Illustrated"
5,Excellent recipes and explanations,"I have been baking recipes from this book for over a year and I am still in love with this book. The recipes are so clearly explained and everything I have made turned out delicious. I now refer to this book as ""the book I trust."" I can't imagine my baking hobby without it!"
5,Chem Lab Cooking at Its Finest,"Baking Illustrated covers 350 recipes, most of which were my favorites from among books already rated five stars. So in fairness it deserves to be ranked with the excellent baking manuals by Nick Malgieri and Rose Levy Beranbaum. This volume is not as well photographed as the other two, and its recipes aren't as concise. If you reliably obtain perfect results in your baking, you might try Malgieri for good looks and Beranbaum for comments on the molecular gastronomy of perfect productions.On the other hand, I don't bake very often, and I'm a little casual about following the rules in recipes. Baking Illustrated gives me exactly what I need: descriptions of what happens when you stray off the path, and explanation of which mistakes lead to disappointing results and why.Of the three best baking books I've read, Baking Illustrated best suits those with an interest in experimenting to perfect their cooking. If I was restricted to one book on baking, this would be it."
4,probably the best in the class,"I was looking for a small stereo system for my study room and after several weeks' online research decided to go for this one. I had reservations initially with this model because by specifications it does not stand very high in the class, although its appearance is quite attractive. Its major drawback is that it does not read MP3 disks as majority of new systems by Philips do; and also the speakers do not seem to be powerful enough. However, It turned out to be quite user friendly, unpretentious and sufficiently powered for my demands. No regrets for this purchase so far, except that I feel that the basses could be more stable (speakers are unshielded) as they sometimes outperform the vocals on the recordings with mixed instrumental effects."
1,Painfull,I made it about 1 hour before I had to turn this off. I found the title character to be so unlikeable.
4,Bronson,Tom Hardy is great in this movie. If you like Tom you will enjoy him being naked. Great body! This movie is intense but with humor. Definitely a good addition to my movie collection.
1,crap,"What a total crap show. This could have been some high school kids senior project, and if it were, they wouldhave never gotten in to college."
3,Freaky,Well done by Tom Hardy. He is a big time up and coming actor. His toughness and psychological ferocity bleeds out in this movie.
1,Just one bullet in the back of his head,They should just give him one in the back of the head. Take him out of his bloody misery as well that of the society.This movie sucks.
2,all songs ok but sound of track 7-11 are bad,in track 7-11 sometime lounder and sometime light if i am in usa i will return this cd [ i am in bangkok and my system are nad viso 2 and nht abs zero]PRAKARN CHANTARASOMBOON BANGKOK THAILAND
5,Super beautiful table.,"This table is beautiful for the cost.The color is deep & it looks like an expensive piece of furniture with out the cost.Seller was quick to deliver, was well packed. I give the seller A+++++ rating.Yes I would recommend to a friend."
4,Does the trick,"We were looking for a small table to match our bedroom furniture and to place a lamp on that wouldn't protrude much from the wall. This was perfect. Although made with inexpensive materials, it doesn't look cheap. The small draw is a nice touch. You can't lose for 50 bucks wh shipping. The finish could have been a bit more glossy."
2,Okay,"I found that the heroine was so needy until she found out about the barter, which was 65% through. She then was angry, with a real reason to be, but the hero seemed like he was trying to blame her for her feelings and saying she was happy now so why does it matter. I think that is a cop out because a woman who is cheated on can be happy until they find out, it still does not excuse the man. I did not feel a connection with the hero and heroine until they were getting married at his grandfather's and I do not see why the heroine fell in love unless it was based on her daydreams alone."
1,Horrible!,"I thought this cover was horrible. It doesn't cover enough area of the cart. It's difficult to put on because of all the ties. I couldn't even get the harness to fit right. Try one of the other seat covers instead that have elastic, you can put them on the cart with one hand, and it completely covers the cart, even the big ones at Costco."
2,"Good ideas, poor execution",Pros: (The reason why I gave this product 2 stars)Shoulder strapsBuilt in bagRings for hooking toysCons: (Why this product really is only worth 1 star)To small for many cartsDoesn't provide full coverageMy daughter began using the rings to pull the front cover upConsensus: The day my daughter decided to pull the cover up and use the shopping cart for teething purposes while I was distracted choosing which soup to buy was the day I called my mother begging her to make me a cart cover. She gladly obliged. The items I listed as pros are the only things I wish I could add to my new cart cover. The Eddie Bauer cover now sits on my garage sale pile.
4,It does what it is supposed to do,I don't agree with the reviews that say it doesn't cover the cart. I used it at both Target and Babies R Us while shopping with my 10 month old today and it worked. You just have to place it in the cart and tie the little ties on the side. I like the way it collapses into the little bag. Look at the picture of the child in it to see exactly what it covers. If thats not enough coverage for you don't buy it.
2,Poorly designed,"The concept of a shopping cart cover is a good one, keeping little hands and mouths from direct contact with germy shopping cart handles and seats. This particular cart cover leaves a lot to be desired.The good: The padding on the portion that goes along the back part of the seat and over the handlebar is adequate; It is turns inside out to become its own storage bag; It has some small loopholes sewn into the padding on the handlebar so that toys can be attached.The bad: The ties on the side and the general design of the back make it difficult to install on a cart one-handed; It will not fit over-sized carts; It has a safety harness, but as it attaches to the back of the seat with elastic, the feature is fairly useless--if my child were to attempt to stand up while strapped in, the cover would easily slip off the back, too. (The solution is very close adult supervision!)Overall, I wouldn't recommend this for the simple fact that it lacks ease-of-use."
2,External Devices Don't work,"I purchased this system several years ago and have enjoyed viewing DVD's on this system. Until recently I never bothered to run my cable box (HDTV) through it, mostly due to the fact that I thought I was doing something wrong when trying configure the system. I could never get it to work. I have now learned that my sytem will not play ANY external devices. Now, I'm going to have to pay for service on this system that probably never worked correctly out of the box."
1,It was worth 2 years only,"I never expected panasonic products to work just for 2 years. It broke down exactly in 2 years. The main carousel changer started malfunctioning. The DVD player used to get stuck...Overall...bad product...bad investment,...Dont buy it!"
5,Best Book on Java for Programmers,"Peter Van Der Linden authored a great book on Java. This book can be benificial for beginners as well as programmers who were exposed to C. If you were exposed to C++, you definetely have your OOP cables messed up. This book will fix them for you.The book is not really jam-packed with tons of applicable examples. It rather requires the reader to do a little bit of tuning to the examples he provides. However, the words the author gives are worth the book's price and more. This book really requires a marker handy. Whenever you're stuck you will always find a sentence which will prevent you from a falling down. Make sure to highlight what you find interesting! This book is excellent."
2,MP3 sounds like a vinyl transfer,"Musically this is a really fine performance, but there are pops and clicks in the MP3 download. I don't know if this is the same if you buy the CD.The last piano flurry on track 11 is cut off and appears on track 12. It's not that the songs run together.If this is not a vinyl transfer then the recording was taken from a deteriorated master but to me, it sounds like vinyl pops and clicks."
1,coffee pot,The lid to the coffee pot arrived dented and with the enamel allcracked and broken. I was very unhappy with this purchase.
4,good read,I don't think I spent more than 10 minutes playing Perfect Dark on my roommate's N64. This book stands on its own.
5,Plenty of Picking,"Just put it on and enjoy. Lots of good Doc out there, but a great place to start. If you don't know much about him, his guitar playing is without equal. His voice is passionate and this collection is a lot of fun."
4,the chateau meroux,"Wonderful...fun...romantic...comedy, great girls night only movie or fun loving for a date night as Well shows what can be accomplished if your. Heart and soul are into"
3,Bashir,"I read this book as I saw the Deep Space Nine, episode ""Inquisition"".Good read, though predictable in places. I like Bashir being more darker and mature because of his conflict with Section 31. Asks questions about ethics and who gets to live."
1,DO NOT BUY PUTCO PRODUCTS!!!!!!!!,"Putco products are expensive garbage! They look amazing at first but give it a little bit they fall apart. I bought this tailgate handle and the door handles and in 6 months the chrome plateing peeled off and rusted. The lifetime warranty in a joke also. Putco does not honor it and relies on the place you purchase it from to honor it. In most cases, like Amazon also, they only honor their store warranty which is usually only 30 days. What a joke! DO NOT waste your money on their products!"
2,Juiceman Pro JM503,"I was disappointed with this juicer which was recommended by a Juice woman & nutritionist when I attended a raw food party at her house. I wanted to buy it for a while but was watching by budget. I finally bought it on sale at Amazon. ...but was disappointed: it is loud, I prefer a quieter juicer & the juice shoots out too fast. It is not as easy to clean as the Juice woman said. I used to own a single gear juicer Samson & was pleased with it as it is quiet & never get stuck. It got old & I had to got rid of it. I will stick to the single gear juicer."
3,one time use,I only got one use out of this camera. After the first roll the camera broke. It takes great pictures but it is very easily broken. If you do buy it be very careful.
1,"Great Idea, But Flimsy & Broken from the Start","Being a lover of photography, and looking for something fun to fill the void left by no longer being able to find film for my polaroid camera, I discovered this camera and decided to give it a shot. After looking at plenty of awesome example photos in the Flickr group, and seeing the sample shots listed here I was jazzed. However I'd been warned that these cameras are not made to be very durable and that the pull cord is often an issue. I seem to have received a camera that was plagued by this. My film never advanced, either. Unfortunately missed the return window for a full refund, but I plan to submit for a partial refund anyway, because I was unable to take even one picture with this product. Disappointed, but still willing to look into other models of unique lomography cameras in the future."
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED - RUST AFTER LESS THAN 1 MONTH,"I was extremely excited to purchase this Le Creuset product, as I swear by me enamel coated dutch ovens and pans. However, this product is a piece of JUNK. After less than one month of daily use, the product began to rust. I first noticed the rust when I was re-filling the kettle. I saw a large rust spot that was flaky and discoloring the water. This is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. The product has been well taken care of, but clearly there is a manufacturing and/ design issue here. Le Creuset will be receiving a letter asking for a refund for this one!"
1,The tea kettle as dribble glass,"You'd think a little more thought would have gone into the design for a tea kettle from a company that makes such fine ovenware and who charges so much for a tea kettle. This little unit really sucks, mainly because it dribbles boiling hot water all over the place every time you pour it (watch out if you're barefoot!). I have tried pouring slowly, fast, medium-speed--at least it's consistent in that it dribbles water every single time, no matter how you pour. Also if you fill it up too a certain level, it sprays hot water all over the stove once it's boiling.I had a Chantal stainless steel kettle before...and boy, do I miss it."
2,Not Made Like They Used To Be,"I should frame this review by saying I've always loved Le Creuset. Back when they were all made in France (not China, as they are now) this was about as high quality as you could buy. When I compare my old Le Creuset to my new pieces, it's almost laughable. And this kettle is not exception. Like other reviewers, I experienced SEVERE rusting in the kettle. In fact, the entire bottom of the kettle was covered in rust. I'm a tea drinker and use my kettle easily ten times a day. I care for it carefully per Le Creuset's instructions and can't fathom why this would rust. Worst of all, Le Creuset's customer service is practically non existent. It also merits mentioning that the color of your enamel will crackle, change and degrade from normal exposure to heat on the stove."
3,"Pretty good, but...","...for $60.00 I expected more. It looks nice, but the finish is not very durable. A light bump against the edge of my sink and a chunk of enamel about an inch long spalled off, exposing the black metal underneath. Not only that, but I've had mine less than a year, using it twice a week, and the whistle has already ceased to function. For this much money this kettle should be better."
4,Great fun!,"A ton of movies, most of which are bad-but really fun to watch. A true spaghetti western fan will love this for his collection."
2,Study purposes only,"Richard Thompson, Warrandyte, Australia. This is a useful collection of Italian versions of the genre--for study purposes only. It has two major limitations:1. When selected from the menu, four of the titles refuse to play.2. Image quality of the transfers is uneven but generally not good. Fuzzy focus for a start, but more irritating are the wrong or wandering aspect ratios/image cropping. Sometimes the aspect ratio varies from shot to shot in the same sequence. So, not much use for visual or stylistic analysis. Still, at the price..."
2,spaghetti western movie pack,"this product was ok, because I was missing a cd!suppose to be 5 cds I got 4.Not good!!!"
4,just as i remember,"Dear All,As good a piece of nostalgia as you could wish for. As violent as a cowboy film could be. The goodies and baddies are easily recognised.Kind regards"
4,Good time party rock 'n roll,"Hmm...what to say about the band that stole their name from the canadian band that was known as Pretty Boy Floyd before this band existed?Otherwise, I'd say this is a decent album for any glam fan out there. Nothing spectacular, but good stuff nonetheless."
2,Disappointing,I was expecting a longer historical view on sugar and was utterly disappointed that the role slavery played in sugar production and commodification is just glossed over in passing.
2,Clever but gimpy,"Clever deveice easy to use; bought it for purpose of ""taping"" lectures at University, at 15 min mode sound play back wasgood(standard speed)...however i was mislead, at 105 min sound quality was garbled garbage...old 8 track tape sound better with mold on it!Format size excellent...ease of use was also excellent, however if taping more than 15 min. ( standard speed) look else where.The product needs more memory to sustain 120 min's, plus ofmemory to sustain quality of recording.However to be useful, this product needs replaceable memory cards..one doesn't have the time to download to a computer with appropriate software to make this device useful."
1,Don't Buy It!!,Panasonic should be embarrased for boasting 105 minutes in LP(long play) mode. The quality of the recording is beyond terrible. In HQ (high quality)the recording is terrific but you only have 15 minutes in total for all 4 folders. I am returning this after owning it for only 20 minutes.
1,I don't like this book,I like math & from the other reviews I thought this would be fun. I just could not get into this book. I don't know what the others saw in what they were reading.
1,Multiple breakdowns,"I purchased our unit in September 2001, and in that time it has broken down 3 times. First the DVD player died, but it was still under warranty so it was eventually repaired by Panasonic.Now, both the VCR and DVD players have stopped working. I expect the cost to repair the unit simply won't be worth it, and I won't be buying anything from Panasonic again."
1,Don't buy this product,"I was weary in purchasing a combo unit, however due to space constraints I decided to take a chance. Boy was it a mistake. The DVD on the unit was not working right off the bat. Took it to the Panasonic Authorized Repair Center and it's been in the shop for the last 5 weeks waiting for a replacement part. By the time I get this piece of junk back from the Service Center the warranty will have expired. Stay away from combo units......"
1,Feels like potato sack,"I bought this set by trusting other reviewers' opinion, and I thought the price is very reasonable for 600 count sheets. This set of sheets feel like 100 counts. I washed them with cold water following the directions; they came out wrinkled after drying on low heat. We have had 350 count sheet set that feels softer than this set. It feels like sleeping in a potato sack :( Don't recommend this set at all!!!!"
2,Compatibility with your Computer,This product will not HotSync with Windows 7...64You need an older version of Windows to use this Palm.I tried every thing that support told me to do but in the endI had to return this item.

5,A Brilliant Read!,"This book falls way out of the genre that I am used to reading (sci-fi, fantasy, horror, & true crime), but this book impressed me greatly. It's very down-to-earth, filled with tales of a small Southern town and its people. Being originally south of the Mason-Dixon, it actually made me miss the little town I was born and raised in - no small feat indeed! The characters are incredibly well defined, the story itself is very compelling, and by the end (which came too early in my opinion), you're considering knocking on the author's door, asking for the rest of the story. This is one book you cannot put down once you start reading.In short, this is one hell of a read and worth far more than the $14.95 list price. You really can't put a price on nostalgia, and this book should bring back memories for young and old from all parts of this great nation.And there's some great recipes sprinkled throughout the book. Chocolate lovers will kick themselves if they don't check this out!"
5,Madhatter's Guide to Chocolate,"The Madhatter's Guide to Chocolate is a ""must read"" book if you want to experience almost every emotion you can think of when you read it cover to cover.I grew up in this very town and the book brought back so many memories. Although the names had been changed and some events had been fictionalized, I recognized many of the characters and the situations they got into. Rhett DeVane's style of writing is very amusing and so descriptive, I felt like I had gone back in time and relived many of the events. I loved the way she sprinkled chocolate recipes and excerpts from the Madhatter's journal throughout the book. I'm going to add some of those recipes to my recipe book.Once I started reading the book, I couldn't put it down and when I finished it, I wanted to read more. I can't wait to read her next book."
5,great and cheap,"Nicely padded strap, for those heavy bassesI use two of them, with some Schaller straplocks...Okay it might not look like the posh leather straps, but I prefer my comfort first !"
4,Near to the best,"I am very pleased with this player. I have found that I must stay away from Kenwood & Sony, they gave me nothing but trouble. This item, however, has been a dream. The only problem I face is the automatic resume function. Even after I have removed a CD and turned the unit off, it wants to resume at the last track played (even with a different CD.) I wish I could turn that function off. Otherwise, it has been a dream. It is nice and sturdy with lots of functions the newer models don't have. I found my unit at a usually overpriced Sam Goody type store really discounted due to it's production date (some 3 years ago). I snatched it up since it has everything I have been looking for. I would recommend this unit to anyone."
1,Texas Saturday Night,"I have to agree with Ronnie's review pretty much of April 21, 2005. I just recieved my copy and was expecting Smokey Wilson the Bluesman not what I'd received! I've listened to Texas Saturday Night and don't hate it, but I wouldn't have ordered it had I known it wasn't the ""Real Smokey"". I've recently discovered Smokey Wilson the Bluesman and want to add as much of him to my Blues collection as I can."
4,Which way to the beginning?,"Avi tells a tale of two unusual friends. Avon, the snail and Edward Ant who become best friends and adventuring partners. You see, after Avon read many books he realized he was sad that he had never been on an adventure. He quickly decides that he is going to go on an adventure to help himself become happy once again. Edward and Avon, though they don't truly travel as far as they think, find adventure in the simplist of things. Together they learn a few lessons and help new friends along the way.This story is good for sharing with young readers. It is very simple to understand with short chapters. Pictures by Tusa help to give the adventure a little more fun. In truth, I enjoyed the Secret School House by Avi better, but a good story over all.By Kerri J. BusteedAuthor of Will's First HuntWill's First Hunt"
5,"The End of the Beginning: a great, fun read!","In The End of the Beginning by Avi, Avon, a snail, is depressed for the lack of adventure in his life. With the encouragement of his friend the newt, he decides he must have an adventure. A new acquaintance, Edward the ant, promises to give Avon the answers to all his questions, ""even if they're the wrong answers,"" and they're off! At turns charming and ponderous, the adventurers have experiences that will be enjoyed at one level by children, and at another level entirely by older readers and adults. Wordplay and humor feature heavily, but not in a pun-driven manner; rather in a style that delights and really escorts the reader into the realm of philosophy. What is an adventure, and what may be the charms of home when seen through a fresh perspective? A delightful read for advanced elementary readers through adults."
1,Waste of money,This book was a great disappointment. I bought it sight unseen and discovered that it has old boring exercises that can be found for free on the Internet. It is geared for Japanese students. It is simplistic and a real waste of money.
3,Good but watch out there is no Copal 3 wrench!,Does what it says on the tin but watch out there is no Copal 3 wrench. So if you need it for that then look elsewhere!
5,THE BEST ONE !!!!,"I HAVE VOL.1.2 AND NOW 3 THIS IS THE BEST ONE CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT ,PLUS THE NEW FREESTYLE MIX IS VERY GOOD ,GO OUT AND GET MORE THAN ONE COPY !"
2,"Great material, bad reissue","I hate to give Clarence only 2 stars here, but this review must be for the CD as a whole. It can be summed up in 2 words: Artificial Reverb. Oh yeah, and 2 more words: Too Much. First used in the 1950s by RCA to try and make classic recordings sound more ""modern"", it was largely abandoned by the early 1960s because it made the recordings sound distant, muddy and indistinct. That is the problem here. Most of this stuff is very well recorded, albeit old and prone to a bit of natural noise. But if the records are cleaned up right (and the technology is certainly out there, as we have seen from Archeophone's products) we often hear the natural ambience of the recording itself, not someone else's opinion of what they think it might have sounded like in a large, empty hall. The reverby production value was abandoned for a reason: it sounds artificial. This is kind of like listening to a reissue from the 1950s; a period famous for bad reissues."
4,"Excellent sound and quality, non-standard power jack","I just bought this unit. Its sound quality with the S-XBS (extra base) feature is very good, especially if you use decent headphones. I listened to it playing a music CD while shaking it a lot and jumping up and down: the anti-skip system works flawlessly! FM reception is good. I have not tried to use it with CD-RW.Cons:- A non-standard power connector on the player. I cannot find a power adaptor that has a plug that fits the connector. Even the most versatile and expensive ones I could find at a Radio Shack or Target do not fit.- No clip or belt. Unless you buy some sort of carrying case or hold it in your hand, there is no way to exercise while listening to it."
5,The New King Of Californian Cool,"After the shut down of his previous label Permanent Press Walter Clevenger forms his own label Brewery and ends four years of silence with ""Full Tilt & Swing"". Imagine a world where The Raspberries, Buck Owens' Buckaroos , The Clarence White era Byrds and Brinsley Schwarz jam nightly and you're getting warm to ""Full Tilt & Swing"". Dominated by Clevenger's Nick Lowe-esque vocals and often witty songwriting and a band that loves to twang and thunder this is a CD for those who thought The Eagles eventual slickness gave L.A music a bad name. Hey, what's not to like? Non-dopey lyrics about love, guitars that take no prisoners and a front man who has real imagination...we have lift off. Just buy!!"
5,RR-XR320 digital voice recorder.,"There is little I can add to the previous reviews. This recorder is exceptional. I love the one I have had for about 3+ years.One thing that has not been mentioned is that the recorder will not work with an SD card that has greater than 256MB of memory. I guess the manufacturer figured that was big enough.I could not be more pleased with my XR320. It does appear as though the recorder has been dis-continued, but that is the way of things. Perhaps this might allow you to get one at a lower price than MSRP.Rick"
1,Loads of Info- Horrible Organization,"Learning to play guitar from this book is like reading stereo instructions. This book is obviously written by a true guitar lover- it has interesting drawings, a piece on the history of string instruments and loads of diagrams... BUT this book is rendered to near-incoherent status by its poor organization. The book is organized in chapters, with big headings and loads of diagrams, but when you read the book, you begin to notice that the writing is attrocious. I have read and re-read chapters a half a dozen times and still find myself confused as to what the heck he's trying to say. I was so enthusiastic when I first bought this book because it looked so thorough. I'd get so frustrated, however, my girlfriend finally resorted to hiding the book from me. Finding a good guitar instruction book is SO hard- I feel your pain- but take it from me that this is not the sort of book any beginner would want to own."
