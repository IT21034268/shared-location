4,It wasn't all Greek to me.,"Was this novel typically Binchy - no! Was it enjoyable nevertheless - yes. The only thing I really missed was the Irish Binchy humor so prevalent in her other books all of whichI've read and loved. The lives of the four main characters, all from ""other places"" were interesting and involving. The descriptions of Aghia Anna and Kalatriades were detailed, perhaps, too much since they were very small with not much to them. By the end of this story I could only wish Thomas, Elsa, Fiona and David God speed and for Andreas much happiness with the long awaited Adonis."
3,Mediocre Camera,"I bought this camera thinking that I would be able to take really good Night Shots, The Anti-Shake Does not work at Night and its as good as my Sony DSC-P52 Cybershot(3.2MP) at taking night shots, Its an alright camera for the price and 10MP but I wouldnt recommend it for serouis photographers, this is the camera you wanna take to your vacation or such but not if your a serious shooter, the lens is pretty small and there arent any Wide Angle/Fish eye Lens add ons. I kind of wish I didnt waste my money on it and got an SLR but its good for what it is and nothing more"
2,Not as good as the 7.2 Exilim,"I purchased this camera after my son broke my Casio Exilim 7.2. Unfortunately, most of the stores don't carry the 7.2 models anymore. I bought the latest model EX-Z1000 instead assuming that it'll be just as good, if not, better.I was disappointed to find out that when I took pictures, it had these vertical lines on the LCD screens. Looks defective, but I'm not sure if that is normal with this model. I just returned it anyways. Another thing was that the fact that it's higher in resolution, it fills up my memory card so much quicker. But I don't notice it being any more clearer than my older one. The more I use this, the more my I miss my old camera."
4,Excellent with bad default settings,"Ok so i have owned this camera for about two years maybe three, i been kind of upset for purchasing this unit i been getting very poor quality pictures. But just recently i started messing with the settings and finally i'm beginning to appreciate it's attributes. Here's what i did to improve the quality.quality Fine, ISO 100, Flash intensity +2, sharpness +2, saturation +1, contrast +2, Digital zoom off, try all or maybe at least the following quality fine, ISO 100, digital zoom off.By the way i also own a previous model EX-S600 that unit does not require special attention just point and shoot, i think Casio mess up in the EX-z1000 default settings, give it a try you may learn to love the unit. you may want to recheck your new settings every time you restart the unit it goes back to default settings when turned off."
5,"again...I find it difficult to ""love"" an inanimate object but...",for my purpose it works great. I sand out clear coats using 1000-1200-1500 grit hook and loop sandpaper. I just wish a tool company would fabricate a plastic gizmo that directs the cold blast of air away from your arm. Other than that Im happy with my purchase.
2,"Pro Pad Sead Pad Sheepskin XLG, 6404","Took the item out of the box and noticed that I would have to remove the seat to install the pad. Once I installed the pad it was not as comfortable as I had anticipated. I embarked on a trip thinking the pad would relieve my 'Monkey Butt' experience but the pad was uncomfortable at times. The gel in the pad would shift to one side causing the uncomfortable ride. After 4500 miles of traveling on a day to day trip of 14,200 miles in total. I removed the Pad and discarded it. The remaining trip was not as uncomfortable as I thought it would be since the MC seat was comfortable in itself. I would probably recommend this for short trips but not for long trips as it was intended."
2,Good... for a single,"Most of this album is O.K. at best, with the exception of ""Basement Apartment"" and ""The Hideout"". I would skip the rest of the record and nab it from MP3 if I could. But, some of my now favorite albums started out this way... who knows?"
5,Excellent!!!,"great acting, beautiful stages, good action, what more could u want from a classic old school flick? u wont be disappointed if your a fan of the genre..."
4,Very nice overall but some problems with pieces separating,"My 9-yo has had all this furniture for about 15 months. It's beautiful, she is loves it and she is very careful with everything.In the last month, two of the kitchen items (the fridge and the stove) have started to come apart. It is definitely not from 'wear and tear' as they are not handled very much. The top slab of the fridge is warping upwards and separating from its walls, so the hanging doors keep coming off. Because of the warpage it's difficult to fix without risk of breaking it (don't have a small/gentle enough clamp to use trying to glue it down). The stove is at an earlier stage of the same thing - you can see cracks around the front and side of the stovetop where it's starting to warp and separate too.We have not seen any problems with any of the other rooms' furniture, just the kitchen."
1,Good idea -- poor execution!,"I really wanted this to work....but it didn't! I purchased this at our local grocery store, because the Rubbermaid containers I wanted were out of stock. I am so sorry I did not wait to get the other brand. The lids of the EZ Store, which are supposed to fit each container, fit snugly only on the middle-sized containers. They lifted right off of the large and small containers -- they are neither air- nor water-tight -- they can barely hold food!I took the food out of the two large containers I was going to use, filled the containers with soapy water, set them on the counter, and 10 minutes later my counter was covered with water! The containers were leaking through the bottoms.This product seems like a great idea, but in practice they simply do not work. They are very poorly manufactured."
2,Not what I expected,"The book is teenie tiny, and the ideas are nothing new. It makes an okay coffee table book, but if you are legitimately looking for photographic inspiration, this is not the book for you."
4,An Excellent Way To Begin the Morning,"This smoky falvoured black tea expertly blends the essential spices of Keemun, Darjeeling, Ceylon, and Assam to create a powerful brew. Unlike the numerous herbal teas that I frequently indulge in, the flavour of this brew is more akin to the traditional teas in that the flavour and aroma is heady and tends more toward bitterness. Due to this aspect, I found that cream was conducive to this brew and that for those who prefer a more mild tea, brewing is best at three minutes. Although I usually do not indulge in such strong tea, I found this to be the quintessential compliment to the breakfast atmosphere in that its invigorating taste and potent tinge helped to bring me more fully awake. Each element of the tea interwove to create a complimentary and elegant taste that no true tea connoisseur should miss. Overall, this having been my first venture into the Numi tea brand, I can envision myself returning to this particular brand in future.- Ravenova"
3,Low budget disjointed scare movie w/twists & unsure ending,"This movies starts off slow and I was unsure why I rented a SCARY movie. I choose it by the cover and the list of stars and thought it would have more humor, if it was there I missed it. The big scare & comedy never came and there were to many lose ends. Not asking what disease the girl had, what happened to the body, where was the bad cop that hated him, the foreshadowing of the tree house fire that ended up being the ""answer to many questions"". This movie had some actors of note and they played their parts well but the ""bee"" at the end ruined the movie for me. This could be rated 3 1/2 stars but that was not an option and wearing the wire was used to get the HERO quickly OFF the hook...I guess. I did enjoy it and ended up watching it again with my wife so it was OK+."
1,Sub-standard,It's not possible for me to properly review this product because I reaally didn't get a chance to use it. During installation the sub-standard screws broke causing the unit to fall and break on my desk. Even after drilling pilot holes the screws were so soft they fell apart. The manufacturer should find a supplier to provide screws that will go through something harder than balsa. Light ended up in the landfill unfortunately.
2,where are the good photos?,"i didn't like this book because defining in some pictures weren't that good i expected them to be from some other pictures of eric kroll and cover of the book. inside the expressions of the girls weren't so ""happy and joyful"" they didn't fit in the mood that pictures tried to express."
4,A must own for Iron Maiden fans,"After finally hearing Angel Witch's debut, its no wonder that Iron Maiden fans speak of this album highly! This is a classic NWOBHM disc that has all the tradmark NWOBHM sounds. My only regret was not trying the band soon as I was turned off by their rather silly band name. The music is great and the lyrics are catchy. Don't let their name and ""satanic"" image fool you, this is a great band and its a shame they weren't able to achieve the success as Iron Maiden. Some say this disc is even better than Maiden's debut. I can't decide but there's no denying the greatness of this disc. Make sure to pick up a remastered copy with bonus tracks as it makes the listening experience that much better."
3,Title is a little miss leading,"I was excited by the cover words, no wheat, no gluten, no dairy, no eggs. It seems miss leading when you look up the recipes and they have eggs or dairy in them. The substitutes are provided at the bottom of the page, but when you are already substituting several items it can be frustrating at times. Although, I do believe most all the recipes are gluten and wheat free. I have found some recipes but have not had the chance to try them. I guess if you are only avoiding gluten and wheat it will be benifical."
1,Shield Your Eyes and Run!,"This book is absolutely dreadful. It made me want to cry. You cannot sit down and read this book. It is so horribly written that the reader loses all interest, even during the interesting parts of history, such as world war two. Pick something else to read."
4,Canon Powershot Neck Strap,Excellent well made product. Just a tad too bulky but it looks like it will last forever.
4,Nice construction,Nice mirror. Good magnification. Solid construction. My only change would allow vertical adjustability to allow flexibility in positioning on the wall. I had to move a picture to position it at the correct height.
3,Small,"I bought this during an Amazon jewelry sale for under $25. The 18"" length is great so it sits nicely when wearing. I give this 3 stars because the pendant itself is very small, similar circumference to a dime. I was anticipating larger. The diamond/sapphire idea is nice, but the stones are so small and squished together that is sort of looks like a wreath. The gold chain is exactly as appears in picture, very average. The stone setting is tight, I'd be amazed if a ""chip"" ever fell out. It does sparkle a little bit. Not a bad buy for a small pendant that's on super sale. The back is a solid gold circle that says ""China"" on it. If it wasn't so small, it could be a really great piece of jewelry."
4,Just right!,"Fujifilm SC-FXA03 Soft Case for FujiFlim Digital Cameras is a perfect Fit for Fujiflim A900 Digital Camera that I have, I researched Fujiflim's website to confirm before I bought this item.When they mean ""compatible"" it **just** fits, Fits a bit **too** tight with the first few go arounds. As this material is strechy I feel eventually it will be just perfect. Also some portions of the camera is still exposed for that reason I am giving it 4 stars.Oh! By the way, You will not get the same Item as pictured on Amazon, Checkout Adorama's Website, you will get the Black color case. I personally prefer the Black case as it looks good than the ribbed blue on pictured here which apparently is the Fujifilm SC-FXA04 Soft Case for Fujiflim based Digital Cameras.So far from my understanding SC-FXA04 is Blue, SC-FXA03 is Black, The picture on Amazon's website is wrong"
4,One of most exciting thing i own...,"I am so excited about this digital dictionary. So handy, and convenient.I carry this wherever I go, especially if i have a book with me to read.I no longer have to wonder what a word means, unless the word is not in this dictionary,which is why I'm only giving this a four star - because of limited word content, only 250,000.Another thing that would have been very nice - a case or a pouch to protect this gadget while in my purse.I had to buy a case/pouch for it because I'm afraid it would break while i lug it around.There really isn't a case/pouch for it out there that perfectly fit.I had to settle for something that's a bit big - a pouch for a Kindle Reader which cost me $15.And i didn't like that!"
3,the display died after year of using,"the display died after year of usingnot bad dictionary, but for that money I like it work much longer"
2,LCD screen deteriorated,I had this for a few years and all of a sudden the screen went kaflooie. I was going to buy another but now recall the price I paid for it. No way. I'll get something cheaper.
4,Needs update,"This product is far superior to it's competition. It needs updating because it is over 10 years old and needs cyber language added as it has none. It also needs better quality electronics as it does not seem to last. Mine quit after a couple of years. My replacement, an 'advanced' model from a competitor, has been reported to last for 20 years, but so what, if the dictionary is lacking and difficult to read and you don't like it. Still this one is the way to go if you need one. I am considering buying another one, but am hoping for an update."
5,It is worth it,One of the most useful purchases I've ever made. I bought this item almost four years ago and since then I use it everyday. I'm thinking to get another one as a back up unit. Couldn't live without it.
5,Excellent Electronic Dictionary,"If you are going to purchase an electronic dictionary, this is the best, most complete and most applicable to all kinds of reading material. I bought a second one for my son."
1,disappointed,I previously had a Sharp Pw E300. This was the best dict/crossword aid I have ever had.So much contained in so small a body. When it died(broke down) I immediately looked for another Sharp and purchased one through you. This dict/crossword aid seems to contain about 10% of my previous one .Really disappointing
2,Think Twice,"Loved it when it worked. Return twice, in one year, to SHARP rep for replacement. Third one is now dead and I can't be bothered to pursue getting it repaired or replaced."
4,Had to try it ...,"This is a good sized product, with a convenient pump.Smells like sweet milk. But not too sweet. Just a hint.I'll give it 4 stars because it does not absorb quicklyand takes a good amount to really moisturize my hands (that I constantly wash).I've just ordered the skinMilk hand cream.Hopefully, that one will be better for the cold winter days thatdry my skin.I will compare and post a review."
2,"My least favorite Deliverance release, but still not too bad.","Back in the 90's I got the cassette of this album new & used music store. It was mainly for the sake of collecting. I played it a couple times to play music critic & filed it away. It's more experimental seeming to delve into ""alternative"", but still keeps a metal edge. It's a case of a band trying to 'update' their sound, and it turns around to bite them. The re-issue CD is on my to get list, mainly because I'm a collector. Rather I like this album or not, Deliverance has a done a great deal to the development of the Christian metal genre as we know it. Also, they were never shy about proclaiming their faith. You'll get 101 reasons why you need Jesus along with heavy riffs."
4,Just like in a 5 star hotel bathroom,Recently had the use of one of these mirrors in a wonderful hotel and found this one through Amazon. Just as good a product and I can see things that you usually don't want to!!!!
5,So handy!,"Having looked through all of the stores, I finally found exactly what I needed here at Amazon; a simple wall mounted adjustable mirror to put my hair up in back using both hands and still see what I was doing. The design is elegant and simple and I discovered how necessary a good magnifying mirror is, which is on the reverse side. It easily moves around so you can view the whole back of the head. Just make sure the mirror is screwed into the wall at the height you require. The assembly and mounting was very simple and easy to understand, and the mirror is sturdily made and doesn't wobble. I am very happy with my purchase and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product. It is even better than I expected."
4,Good Quality,Nice mirror lacks ability to move vertically. Easy install and compact.Great for make-upNickle finish looks great in any bathroom
4,Item was re-packed - not new,Item was re-packed - it must have been returned by another customer. Item was as described.I am a frequent Amazon customer. This is the first time an obviously returned item was sold as new.I did not want to bother with shipping the item back. Amazon needs better quality control.
2,Piece of junk,"I've had this mirror for 6 months now and I hate it. It does the job, but the hinges were poorly designed so the mirror is difficult to move. At my last place I bought the ""Wall Mount Scissors Extension Arm 5X Magnifying Mirror"" which I liked MUCH better."
1,Not plumb,"I finally got around to mounting this. I am not happy. First the wall anchors that come with it. I've never seen any like it. They spin in the wall. I finally got it up and it was crooked. I even had plumbed it with a level but it was way off. took it down to plumb it more carefully, but made the hole to close to the other one and drywall failed. I moved it over a bit. Now I have 2 holes to patch. Mounted it again with the level and it still came out crooked. Then I noticed the holes in the mounting plate are crooked. It is pretty obvious. Check to see if your holes are level before you mount it. I took to long to get around to installing it. Now my window for complete refund has expired. Can Amazon or Jerdon please send me a good one?"
5,Just what I was hoping for,"Lightweight, warm and cozy, covers the knee, nice an roomy. The charcoal grey is also a very nice color. Bought it for my husband for Christmas and he loves it."
2,Works fine except for the video,"I tried this docking station because my Gateway laptop with Vista does not come with a docking station as an accessory. As many other reviewers have noted, this product, as well as a similar item from Targus I also tried, will not support Vista properly. For one thing it disabled the Aero feature. I downloaded the Vista drivers but no help there. Ended up returning it.I think a generic docking station will not support Vista properly. Probably because all the data has to transmit via the USB connection. Buyer beware, before you order any of them, call the manufacturer first and check."
2,Not quite what I expected,"I was looking for something to keep my wrapping paper organized, and thought this would work well for the half-dozen rolls I usually have around. While it did work fine for some of the rolls, many were either too short, too long or too thick. The metal prongs that hold each roll into place don't allow for much size adjustment. I've found that the rolls which didn't fit are the ones bought through those mail-order fundraisers (you know the ones - kids' parents are always selling these), and the ones from Costco (the wide, short ones). I do love the hanging feature, but agree with other reviewers that once all the rolls are in place, you can't roll up the organizer and use the buckles without smashing all the paper. If I had room to keep this hanging all the time, it would be perfect. But I bought it because I thought it could be rolled up nicely and unfortunately, it just doesn't."
3,50 dollar magazine,"This book is smaller than a cosmo magazine. Can't say much else other than I've used it once and now it's midterm, I dislike being required to spend 50 dollars on a magazine I'll maybe put practical classwork to once or twice. Good info but not 50 dollar good for a starving college student."
5,Abuse Of Power,"A fine, if somewhat dry, account of one of American journalisms finest hours.I'm rather shocked by some of the other reviews of this book which claim that it ""proves"" Woodward & Bernstein were ""wrong,"" implying that Nixon et al were innocent. The episode those reviewers seem to be referring to was not an example of a reporter getting it wrong but rather being intentionally being misled by sources. There is a difference.And the fact is that they got it RIGHT. Of all the co-conspirators, Nixon was the only one who never could bring himself to admit his own guilt.This is why I become a news reporter."
5,book,Great book Arrrived on time and in was as per the description. jjjj jjjjj jjjjj jjjjj jjjjj jjjjj jjjjj ddddd
2,The Longest Newspaper article I have ever read,This book was written like a newspaper article. Straight to the point with no explanations and no emotional feel. It gave me no background and therefore only those who lived during Watergate could understand. I don't care if you talked to so-and-so's secretary and didn't get any good leads. I agreed to read this book with the thought that I would gain more information about what Watergate was really about. Well I know a little more but now I care less. Sad but true.
5,Investigative Report,"This book is the investigative account of Watergate and the cover up that followed more than it is about Watergate itself, in my opinion. It also does a great job talking about the decisions of Tom Bradlee to hold on stories or run with them. Ms. Graham is featured in this book and her role and support of these unknown reporters. This book not only educates us about the story of Watergate but the inner workings of the newpaper business. Once you understand the characters and who worked for whom, you won't be able to put the book down."
4,All the President's Men,"I picked this to read for an American History book report. It happened in my childhood, so I thought it would be good to find out more of the detail. It reads well and keeps you interested in finding out who gives in next and how the story unfolds. These two writer/reporters are privvy to great bunches of information and sources. They pick and pick until the dam breaks loose. During a few points, they fear for their lives and careers and have to make quick decisions to save themselves. Much better than I thought it would be!"
2,Very poor McGee,"I'm sorry, but I completely disagree with the other reviewers. I found this book to be shockingly bad. While other McGee books sparkle with Travis' commentaries on social trends and peripheral characters, and possess intricate plots, this book was a straightforward revenge story, with McGee and his sidekick Meyer confidently and flawlessly triumphing over the evildoers. There is no suspense, and the book is written in a rather haughty style, glorifying the abilities and righteousness of McGee. I was nauseated by the final third, just trying to finish it up, shaking my head at the lack of suspense and the wooden tone. I think one has to have a simplistic devotion to the series and/or character to see this installment as among the best of the series, because it comes off as sort of a love letter from MacDonald to McGee. Try ""Long Lavender Look"" for a McGee with all this series has to offer, and don't read this one until you're thoroughly immersed in the series."
4,What a BEAST!,This thing is HUGE! I had no idea the links were so massive. Don't get fooled like I did in thinking they are standard chain links. I read all the reviews and was still shocked by the sheer mass of this thing.Locking mechanism works well. It's pretty short. You aren't going to lock it around a thick pole and still get through your downtube and front tire.Very happy with it. Took my bike to the store today and was completely relaxed shopping. No way will it get taken.I took a point off because the lighted key didn't work. I took the cover off and there are two batteries and a very flimsy couple of wires for contact points. It's not worth buying two new batteries for me or writing the company for another key. I noticed another reviewer said the same thing about the lighted key. It must be hard to keep them on the shelf for a long time and have them still work. Oh well.Definitely recommend this product but be CERTAIN you know how big this is!
4,"Terrific LaPlantz, poor editing","This is a must-have for anyone who loves bookbindinding and/or is a fan of Shereen LaPlantz' terrific work. There are some excellent structures and lots of great information. It's too bad that such a terrific book had to be marred by poor editing, but it is still very much worth owning. It is extremely relevant to this review to note that corrections to the book are available at http://www.laplantz.com. The book and website taken together deserve FIVE stars."
2,I thought it would be better,"I remember watching this movie on the TV when I was younger; it was really funny and clean. That's because I probably saw it on Disney or something like that, and the cussing was taken out. There is quite a bit of cussing in this movie, as well as a couple unnecessary scenes when he is walking around in his whitey-tighties, which some might find a bit awkward when showing to the family.IF you could find the TV rated version, it'd be a pretty decent movie. But if you are looking at this with strict standards, I wouldn't recommend it."
4,It's A Cute Movie But The Ending is Very Sad!,Turner and Hootch is a cute movie about a cop played by Tom Hanks who has to look after a dog named Hootch and Tom Hank's character is a neat freak and the dog is very messy and This is movie is cute but the ending was very sad!
2,sad ending,All the humor and amusing antics of the script go completely out the window when Hooch dies at the end. Bah! Kill Hanks but not the dog!
1,this is a joke,"this is a joke. just another DIY video showing someone how easy it is for an amatuer to do a job that it takes professionals years to perfect.if you think you're going to buy this video and produce professional quality results, THINK AGAIN. take the $80 and put it towards a professional application.if you think you're going to buy this video and be able to open your own shop over the weekend, THINK AGAIN.window tinting is an art, not just anyone can do it, no matter how long you try. and no video will ever be able to show you how to properly apply film. only hands on experience, AND LOTS OF IT, will ever get you to produce an acceptable tint application.and even if you are a ""natural"", you'll never be able to get your hands on professional grade film. (despite what is written on the box) so in a years time, you'll still end up with a purple mess that will cost you double to have a professional remove it and tint it right.take my advice, this is a job best left to the professionals."
1,Where's the beef?,"I found the book poorly written and researched. The title is ADO.NET Database programming. What is offered is 5 chapters on DB design, 2 on ADO access and a couple more on XML. The author states he uses an older version of MSDE ( version 7) and discounts MSDE 2000 and Access databases. The latter being non-enterprise or desk top databasing. The meat of chapters 6 and 7 for ADO failed to explain the internals of use of the ADO objects. I returned the book and deemed it a failure. I've since bought Microsoft's ADO.NET Core Reference and found that it answers my questions."
4,Utterly Infectious&#65533;,"Cheers to the hometown heroes who crafted this album. Songs like ""Tangerine Speedo"" make it almost impossible to sit still. Like all the songs on the album, it's the perfect combination of witty lyrics and serious musical talent. This band is certainly one to watch. Like Smashing Pumpkins and Liz Phair - Chicago has churned out another winner."
5,Great Deal!,"Super purchase, we are very impressed with it. We bought this for Sunday morning pancakes, so we could all sit together and have hot pancakes...works great. Super easy to clean, looks nice. Well worth the money. :)"
3,Robust until busted,"My wife and I were very pleased with this unit during the time it worked, which was roughly two weeks. On the grill's last day we heard a cracking sound and found the control knob shattered and displaced, after hearing a ""noise"". It was easy to find a replacement controller on Amazon, right up there with the intact units that were being sold. Strange, because there were no other ""replacement parts"" on the page, just appliances in the whole. Does somebody know something, but isn't telling? I'm ordering the replacement controller (once) rather than trying to get them to replace the unit for free, but am suspicious at this point that they may have a known design flaw in the control unit, and are in the business of selling replacement controls. Time will tell.February 5th, four months later.Well, time has told. The second controller has failed. Ordering one more, and the unit goes into the trash."
1,Dead On Arrival! Do Not Buy!!!,Based on the other reviews I purchased this product. Unfortunately the product did not work out of the box. I initially tried to work with Cuisinart Customer Service but have found them to be incredibly RUDE. Cuisinart wanted me to pay shipping and handling (as well as a ten dollar processing fee) in order to replace a defective unit that never even worked out of the box. The turn around time to replace the unit was over three weeks. I would stay away from this product!!!
3,"Very nice to cook with, but very heavy","We love cooking on this, especially the grill side. Since we can't grill outside (city living), this is the perfect way to grill up some veggies or hamburgers.Pros:Cooks evenlyindoor grillinghigh quality, sturdyOptions: one side is griddle and the other is grilleverything comes apart to make cleaning a little easierCons:HEAVY! Wifey won't use it unless I get it out off the shelf for her. This means we grill less.Cleaning isn't easy, and requires a lot of scraping with the provided plastic tool.Also large, complicating cleaningSo if you have the storage space, strong arms, and don't mind taking the time to clean, this is a great choice for indoor grilling."
5,A Philosophical Approach,"If you have been looking for a more academic approach to the history of computing then this is the book for you.The book is divided into three parts. Part One contains a very comprehensive taxonomy/chronology showing the evolution of human number systems.Part Two is where you will find the core ""History of Computing"" bit: tables, logarithms, analogue/digital, mechanical calculators, automatic calculation, electronic machines etc. It also includes an interleaved, and detailed, explanation of how computing has evolved from basic number crunching into abstract information processing.Part Three reads like a long philosophical conclusion and contains some excellent material on ethics and artificial intelligence."
5,Great gate!,Love the flexibility for a difficult space - we have it at an odd angle and it works well. Can't attach to a stairwell though but we tied the end bar to the bannister with some strong plastic zip ties and it's very sturdy. Would recommend this gate - love the door feature as well - easy to use with one hand.
3,Okay if you want a permanent structure,"It is a sturdy bugger and the expandability allowed me to block off my living room from the rest of the house. The main drawback I have with the item is that it has no portability what-so-ever (unless you buy a second unit and attach them together to create a giant playpen). To make this work, screw it into the wall. There's one set of wall mounts so it's not like you can even swing it around to another location. If you want to use this, keep in mind, you are putting 8 screws into your walls and/or woodwork to do it. Other than that, it keeps my powerhouse 1-year-old contained and she even does pull-ups on it (she weighs 22.2 lbs. and is 31.5"" tall) w/o a problem."
1,"We bought ours from Amazon/Buzmart, Inc.","I ordered this gate from BabyAge but they never processed my Amazon transaction. Amazon contacted them and so did I in an effort to complete the purchase. I only got a reply from BabyAge after I told Amazon and BabyAge to cancel my purchase since I no longer wanted to do business with them.If you want this product then I recommend purchasing through Amazon but not BabyAge.We finally got the gate from Buzmart, Inc. since BabyAge failed miserably in order processing and customer support.I'm unable to change my 1 star rating to 4 stars but this is a pretty good gate. You'll really need to try to find a wood stud to secure the gate. Sheet rock just doesn't take the abuse of adults climbing over (to prevent the kids from seeing how the gate opens) and kids hanging or leaning on the gate.The gate was easy to adjust and install. We had to take a panel out and that was relatively easy."
3,Looks great and is sturdy but with some issues...,"I purchased two of these to make a large playpen, and it looks great, is sturdy and having gates is great. However, the space between the metal bars is too wide. My 9 month old reaches his arms out all of the time and I can just imagine that when he starts standing he may fall down and break his arm in between the bars. Another issue is that the gates are metal (which helps to make it sturdy) and my son fell down and hit his head on the bottom bar (his first bruise). I think the company could have padded the metal on the bottom a lot better. So, playpen time is monitored...at least the larger size of the pen allows an adult to sit in it comfortably.One more thing...I found some great mats to put in the playpen.They are called Softtiles and they don't have a strange scent, are cute and are high quality.[...]"
5,Fits anywhere!,"Love the gates!! I purchased two for large spaces, set them up with ease, and had used them as an enclosure at first. Now, set up as gates, they move with ease around funiture and spaces that gates would normally not enclose. They basically fit anywhere. I would difinitly recommend them! They keep my twins out of trouble!!!"
1,This company has horrible customer service!!,"I ordered this gate over 2 months ago and am still not able to install it in my den. I have made 4+ phone calls to this company to try to receive the right parts for installation, but still do not have them. They say they are sending them and don't. Or the next call they say they are sending them, and send the wrong thing. Then they send only one piece of what I need! I called back today after waiting another week for the parts and they said that they would be mailing them today. It is never ending and I am so tired of them promising results but not following through. I would seriously consider buying from another company because this one does not back up their products when push comes to shove! My daughter has gotten 2 months older and I still do not have a gate to protect her because of this company's sloppy customer service!"
2,A short term item...,"We had this gate for almost a year before it broke beyond repair. The hardware that comes with the gate is not sturdy enough to mount it securely; my son has ripped it out of the wall a number of times. Luckily, he never caught on to the velcro panel, but he did realize it was easy to move. If you've got the gate on a wood floor the feet next to the door will slide very easily and the plastic joints will break. Today he finally managed to shake it enough to break the joints on both sides of the door, so we're off to look for another gate. On the plus side, the material panels are durable and never ripped despite repeated climbing attempts."
1,Not compatible with the old version!,"We purchased a gate by Summer Infant about 3 years ago and liked it. So when we decided to buy another one to extend the old one we found out, that the new one is totally incompatible with the old one. Now we have to return it and lose a lot of money on the shipping since it's not sold ny Amazon and not qualifies for free returns. The new one is made of thinner tubes and looks like has a poorer quality."
2,3 Broken Gates,"We received three broken gates before we were able to piece together one functional gate. The unbroken finished product is great and the customer service was excellent. Although they did say they would ""rush"" the replacement gates, both replacement gates took about 7 days to come in. But, they sent them with no hassle. These gates are poorly packaged, which may be the reason they arrive with broken hinges."
3,would get for older kids,I bought this baby gate when my son was a baby to keep him from getting to the computer and my treadmill. Well when he turn about a year and a half he figured that he can climb on the pieces that connect the gate together. Now he can climb over it and get to the other side. I still use it (hes 2 now) but I can't Leave him alone because he climbs over it with in seconds. I also have 3 sets that I use out in the yard as a play area and he also does the same thing out side. I paid about $400 for all 4 sets and I don't think I should have wasted my money on them since he can get over them so easy. Save your money.
4,Great Extended Gate System,"This gate works great to keep my 10 month old daughter in her play area. You need to get use to operating the door, especially when you only have one hand to do it with and need to get use to stepping over the bottom piece on the door because I tripped over it a couple of times. Otherwise, it really does the trick. We tried the gate that uses the compression but it did not hold very well and my daughter was actually able to push it over a couple of times. Needless to say it went back. I saw this extra wide gate on line and purchased it. We need the gate to extend an area of 10 feet. This fit very well and was easy for my husband to install. We are very grateful to have it. I would highly recommend this product."
4,Very true,"In this book you find why some event always happen to you ,because you are not confident enough to deal with them .I find this very useful in terms of categorizing the confidence ,and the method you use to evalute yourself and find current position of yours in confidence ruler ."
4,Excellent Classical Education book,"Finally, a book on classical education that gets it right. I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 only because I thought a few points could have been fleshed out a bit more. The author makes many important points that need to be understood by classical educators in a way that is refreshing and easy to comprehend. Latin is important. ""Multum non multa""-Not many things, but much! Go deeply into a limited number of great books. Every homeschooler should at least borrow this book in order to understand where many of our great minds came from and how not to be overwhelmed with loads of curriculum. There are a few minor bugs in the book in relation to recommendations, but to the author's credit he acknowledges that the parent must be flexible in using the material and schedules that are suggested in the book. Lots of good stuff in this one."
2,Died too soon,"The air activation button (under the palm grip lever) jammed down so that it's now always on. Not repairable since the body is a block of cast resin. It lasted me 18 months of light use, maybe a total of 3-5 hours use. Not what I'd expect from an IR tool."
1,Died in 6 Months,Owned this orbital sander for 6 months and only used it to sand one car hood during that time. Kept it as clean as you can a sander and oiled it before each use. Set the regulator to the proper air pressure each time I used it. Went to use it again and it has died; will not do anything. Calling ingersoll rand tomorrow to see if they will cover under warranty. Took the covers off to see if there was something I was missing when I cleaned it after each use (wipe off and blow with compressed air) - there was not. Very disappointed.
3,Political Statement or Reference Book?,"While this book did tell me most of what I wanted to know about ""gentle birth"", it did so in such a biased manner that I had to double check any of the information in the book that I wanted validated. The book hides its information in a political statement about birth and many historical birth facts aimed at discrediting doctors and hospitals. While that was interesting, it was not what I was looking for. This book is a good read, but I would not go so far as to call it a guide, and ""informed"" is only from one (very biased) position."
3,Slouching Toward Insipidity,"I have the original of this album, so I can't comment on the bonus tracks. However Al seems to be stretching for weighty words fraught with mystical allusions and it doesn't quite work as it has in the past. Historical references, too, are wearing thin. That being said, there are some real gems on this album. We all know someone like the person described in ""Paint By Numbers"", and the guitar work is superb. ""Optical Illusion"" is haunting both lyrically and musically. There is nothing terrible on the album and contrary to the hack reviewer, I find ""Merlin's Time"" very listenable. The problem with the album is the increasing insipidity of some of Stewart's lyrics as shown on ""Constantinople"". Hard-core Stewart fans will find much to enjoy here but we know also that Al can do better."
4,skylark fan,I also wanted to read the next book. I had forgotten part of this book. May have to reread it.
3,Free SF Reader,"A get into space opera, if you like, with some of your standard Smith elements, good good guys, sneaky bad guys, and lots of blowing stuff up. It is not too bad, but certainly isn't the Lensman series, by any stretch, and the fact that it is an earlier work probably shows. Still, pioneering sort of stuff for the time, but shows a bit more of the late 19th century type influences, I think."
3,not exactly as pictured...,"While these beads are quick to change color in the sunight, don't believe for a minute that the colors you see in the picture are the hues you will get. Light pastels would be a better description, there are no vibrant blues and magentas as pictured, more like aqua and lavender, along with yellows and oranges. The pack says there are 170 beads, and while I didn't actually count them, we made 6 or 7 bracelets with 9-10 beads to the bracelet with a dozen or so left over. A lot of money for very little beads, but I have been unable to find locally at any of the local craft stores (Michael's or Jo-Ann) or bead shops, so I guess if you really want them,then you pay the price."
4,UV Beads,"I just brought the UV beads for my science fair project. It worked great. The beads really changed color when they hit the sun, but the color was light and it was mostly purple or pink.However,it was fun to play with especially with little kids. Hope you would like it too!"
4,Boing! I wasn't expecting this...,"Hey, these are a nice quality and do all that I'd expect them to do... except close. When not in use, they spring apart with no latch or other restraint. To close them up for storage, I have to put a rubberband around the handles. If this was explained in the product description, I missed it. Maybe I would have ordered them anyway had I known in advance, because they *are* comfortable."
2,same problem other people are having,"Mine didn't hold up either. For what I paid for it, I expected more. One I picked up for around twenty is doing a much better job and lasted through more than four uses."
1,No words can describe,"...how awful this remake is...I'm not even against remakes, really. This one is just so bad, I can't believe it made the album. Mallrats probably love it...how sad. Everyone else has covered the details. Please, buy or find a copy of Who's Next."
1,bad battery,This battery was worse than the one I was replacing! It would not take a charge. Ended up buying another at a local battery store.
2,No Definitions,"The editors' introductory essay does everything but define visual rhetorics. They define some major semiotic concepts from Roland Barthes and C.S. Peirce and, for some reason, the concept of intertextuality. But nowhere in the introduction, or in their own chapters, do they provide a definition for visual rhetorics.For that, the reader must skip to Chapter 3,""The Rhetoric of Visual Arguments"" by J Anthony Blair. However, Blair has a very specific focus--argument--so his definition comes with its own limitations. The rest of the essays offer a decent sense of how to apply visual rhetoric, and Sonya K Foss in the final chapter also attempts a definition. Four stars for these essays.Two stars for the book as a whole. The editors ruined the chapters with their odd subheadings, and I just cannot get over their confusing writing in the introduction and their complete failure to fulfill the promise made in the title of the book. As a student with a limited budget, I feel totally misled."
5,a great book,This diverse collection of scholarly essays on the emerging field of visual rhetoric is a must-have for your library.
3,Cooking with Kids,"This is a fun book, the recipes are easy and they are organized by what the kids do and what the adults do. It's nice that the kids do most of the cooking, the adults work with the hot stove or oven, and things like cutting meats, but the kids do just about all of the cooking. The only downside is that there aren't really any seasonings in the recipes, they tend to be a bit on the bland side, and we LOVE flavor!! However, it is a great book to teaach kids cooking, and, as a bonus, if you have a family member on a restricted diet, chances are there's something in here for them!!"
1,Skip through it,"Simon is tall. Joshua broods. Now you can skip about 400 pages. I thought the series was picking up after Stone of Farewell, which was pretty decent. I was the more deceived. The author is simply killing trees here. I would almost recommend just skipping to Part 2 and reading the synopsis of Part 1. You won't miss anything."
3,If you've read every other PKD book...,"If you're like me, and you've read every other Philip K. Dick book cover to cover twice, Clans of the Alphane Moon may not be a breath of fresh air, but it is a new plot. Although I found it kind of slow, who knows psychoses better than Dick? There are better ones out there, but you need it for your collection to be complete"
3,a rush to the end,"This novel starts so promisingly. Its created world of clans of people each with a specific mental illness, and yet 'cooperating' with each other, is very interesting. Its counterworld with the marriage guidance counsellor whose marriage fails, and her husband the CIA writer who scripts and operates remote simulacra (who could resist that!) and who refuses to take up the more lucrative job of a TV comedian's script writer (just one of a team), opens all sorts of intriguing possibilities. Including when these worlds come together.And yet the end of the novel is such a disappointing 'space opera' with a romantic ending that seems unlikely coming from the pen of Philip Dick. Perhaps he was rushed to the end to earn a few extra dollars. And I guess it was practice for the more mature novels that followed."
5,Indispensable Reference.,"This volume, number 8 in the series, is an absolute necessity in anyone's library who studies the Native Americans of California. Edited by the late Dr. Robert Heizer, a student of Alfred Kroeber who authored ""Handbook of the Indians of California."""
3,"Wrong information here, be aware!","I ordered what I supposed was the translation by MirandaI (I had never heard about it, I have to say) and what did I receive? The translation by MacIntyre. I have other translations of course, and Mitchel translation first of all, but I would like to see the Miranda translation. Be aware that the information with different prices in the square below the information on Miranda's translation refer to other translations without even mentioning it... My 3 stars are not about MacIntyre translation (I didn't have the time to look at it yet) but about this misunderstanding."
3,Not bad. . .,"The Beauty of the Earth seemed more poignant. But maybe I just haven't listened long enough to have it speak to my spirit. On the other hand, like a new pair of shoes, they should feel good right off the bat. : )"
4,good,"its a good pendant...nice chain but not as shiny as the picture leads you to believe nor is the sapphire as radiant, it's darker and the pendant may seem to be cheaply made. However, for $30 it's worth it as a nice birthday gift for a good friend or family member, but if you're looking for something more high end at a cheaper cost...look elsewhere"
3,Good album,"Another good LTJ Bukem Earth series album. Not quiet as good as Volume 2 of the series, but it adds to the overall series with a few good tracks o nthe album."
4,A new direction for the Earth series,"Hey, I'll admit it, I'm an EARTH junkie. And when i saw this album, i just had to get it. I didn't even realize it was volume 4 of the earth series until I was perusing amazon (no, i'm not an idiot, the beautiful case is very different from Vol's 1,2, and 3, and LTJ's name is nowhwere on the case anywhere).I also didn't think this was an earth series album because it is quite a departure. a great departure. While i love vol's 1 and 2, 3 is pretty weak (the reviewer who said 1 and 3 were good, while 2 lagged, just got them confused. i'm sure.) This is a great album - a nice infusion of Latin jazz that perks up the sometimes cold drum'n'bass backbeat. get it. you will love it."
1,Disappointed,"When reading and then reviewing references McFeely used, many assumptions were made and facts were left out. Too many errors and assumptions. Historical writing must be as accurate as possible."
1,Bad purchase,"I bought this as a gag gift for my husband, but the joke was on me. The box didn't have the seeds or the peat needed to grow a bonsai, so it looks like I'll be making a trip to a nursery to buy him a little plant he can turn into a bonsai. It isn't even worth returning since the post office is closed for the holiday and I work extremely long hours a fair distance away from the post office."
1,Rip off,"My son bought this from a Scool book club. It was perfectly sealed,but was missing the Peat Pellet needed for fermintation.A couple of kids in his class bought it. The 6.00 I paid for kit will now become 10.00 when I buy the missing part."
2,Not really a bronzer,"This product is mostly golden, not really bronze/tan in color. Mostly makes my face shiny-looking, not tanned. It does apply very smoothly and easily. I would not recommend it for someone looking to add a bit of color."
4,"Good, basic tongs",These are pretty standard metal tongs. I've been doing more grilling lately and needed some that are reasonably priced. They work well.
4,!,Book arrived in stated condition and prior to est. arrival date. Questions at end of each reading are not always congruent.
4,Good purchase,I purchased two for my son and my husband. They recently used them for the first time on our trip to the Dominican Republic for my son's wedding. The bag performed with no issues at all. There was plenty of extra storage room so we could add shoes etc that didn't fit in our suitcases. We were on different flights and different airlines and neither bag was damaged. It was so easy to get through the airports with the wheels. We recommend it.
5,A unique CD you'll love immediately and share with others.,"John Morgan's first release ""The Journey"" has lots of different moods. This one has many different styles...and simply spun my head around at times. The sparing addition of some additional musicians on certain compositions really took things up a notch in my opinion. I've already given this album to a few of my friends."
2,lost the edge,"i have seen this band live about 5 times back during the ""Something to Crow About"" days. i must say they rocked the house like no other each time. In my opinion Something to Crow About is a five star album. on stage Mike Weibe used to make fun of Good Charlotte. On To the confusion of our enemies the riverboat gamblers sound more like good charlotte than themselves. wasted my money. maybe it's the new lineup changes. all three previous albums are better than this one."
5,In Beth Bruno's Garden,"Beth Bruno's ""Wild Tulips"" takes us through the seasons in the garden of life, taking clippings from her experiences as a child, young adult, wife, parent, educator, psychologist and writer. ""Wild Tulips"" is sprinkled with anecdotes from her own, her family's, friends'and clients' lives that show how precious this garden is though it may be occasionally invaded by pests. It is cultivated with wit and Bruno's common-sense philosophy of life. Readers, no matter what their stage in the garden, will harvest a greater appreciation of the wonders of life."
1,Why dont Amazon do something???,"Totally agree with other reviews- this is a rubbish reproduction, an insult to a great movie. SO why dont Amazon act and a) stop allowing it to be peddled and b) help customers get refunds. Has anyone got their money back?"
1,Terrible transfer quality on English subtitle version,"The original Italian version is the one that has been digitally remastered. The other language versions on the disk are faded almost to white in some scenes, grainy - one of the worst, if not THE worst, transfers I've ever seen. De Sica and the stars deserve better."
5,FANTASTICO,This is such a great movie lots of laughs tugs at your heartstrings and teaches to never mess with a woman scorned but also shows strength in a woman who really loves and doesnt want anyone to take advantage of her. Sophia Loren is just a huge favorite of mine and she embraces every role and makes you feel like you experience things with her on film. She is unforgettable.
3,The Inetto and Unruly Woman,"It's hard not to like this Neapolitan trio! Mastroianni is delightful as a womanizer, yet once again unmanned by the indomitable Loren. Pure comedy, Italian style."
4,Nice bag but not the same as pictured,Nice bag well made and lots of pockets. The expanding top creates a lot more room. This bag does not come with panniers sides or the bottle holder as shown. The Model shown is the DXP
2,Didn't like the mix,I only liked the raspberry lemonade flavor so it was a waste of money for me since you have to buy so many at a time. I wish I could get the original lemon flavored ones but I guess they don't make them anymore. That was my favorite flavor.
5,An Unforgettable Spiritual Classic!,"John Donne's poetic words pierce the heart and ignite the imagination. He speaks food for the soul, not just the heart. I have read and re-read his books for many years and cannot tell how deeply they have moved me and inspired me to be a better Christian. He was a profound writer, almost mystical and yet so very down to earth. A beautiful book that should not be missed by anyone interested in the life of faith."
1,misleading title,My family bought this book at the same time as our Russian tortoise. The book is an in general book on several tortoise species. I am very disappointed in the lake of information this book has.
1,diappointing,"This is a book for the real beginner, however it is written in a very distracting and abstract way that even a beginner would find very little substance in this book.it has repetitive and often incorrect information, very disappointing."
4,"""audience for all types of good music""","Few artists can not only survive the test of time, but flourish with the passing of years, longevity, great singer with extraordinary songs, Steve Wariner is one of those rare gems.Stand outs: ""All Roads Lead To You"" (1981), went number one on country charts, ""Some Fools Never Learn"",(1985) a John Sherrill tune, ""Small Town Girl"" (1986), great tune from Don Cook and John Jarvis, also went number one on country charts.This collection is proof, from a ballad ""What I Didn't Do"", to the lively ""Lynda"", they are the foundation of a body of work, from this talented artist.Total Time: 75:58 on 21 Tracks/ Hip-O Records - 314 560 139 2 (2000)"
3,"Jesse ""the mind"" Ventura",This video is a great documentation of Jesse's exciting wrestling career. It includes many highlights of his matches as well as comments from his peers. The video is excellent for the hardcore wrestling fan.
3,ok so-so,It was ok but but it didn't focus too much on his tag-teams like when he taged up with The Rock last year at fully loaded...
4,Topeak's stuff is functional and durable--for nylon,"I use this bag/pannier for grocery shopping and carrying my commuting gear, and it works fine. The best part about Topeak's stuff is the Quick Track system that allows the bag to connect to a Topeak rack easily. No mucking about with Velcro---just slide it into place and click it down. Is the bag perfect? No. The trunk gets compressed when the pannier's elastic straps are hooked to the rack. The nylon fades badly in sunlight, and it isn't really waterproof at all. But it's cheap enough, and works well."
3,Not what I expected,This bag is a high quality product and may be a great option for you if it fits your needs. But it is not as big as I thought. I was swayed by some of the reviews I read here where I thought I could pack a complete change of clothes for commuting purposes. This is simply not the case. This bag is advertised as about 1000ci and I have determined that I'll need at least 1300ci bag for my purposes. The shipping and RMA process by Amazon is great.
4,Nice tool.,"The tool is great. Pricey but very good quality. I own other JessEm tools and while they are very high quality I must state: God be with you if you ever need customer support from JessEm. The name JessEm and the words customer support are mutually exclusive. Too bad Amazon doesn't have a deal with Veritas for wood working tools. The quality of their tools is excellent and their customer service is the best on the planet. Ironically, I believe JessEm and Veritas are both Canadian based companies."
2,quality is not great,"I purchased this for my daily use, since I need a place to put my keys (a big bunch) and my wallet.The layout is good - a front pocket and a main pocket, however, I hope it will have one more small pocket on the back. The size is a little large for everyday carry on.The main complaint is that the quality is not good. The binder ring for the belt became so loose after few days and the belt would dangle around your waist easily. I will return this to Amazon for sure.I had a eagle creek waist pack and it lasted for three years - much better quality control."
2,Smaller than the photo or its dimension suggested,This item is very small. Not large enough for what I intended to use it for. It's dimensions are misleading.
3,Mediocre hip-hop,"After the enormous air-play that ""Enjoy Yourself"" got, this album was sure to end up in a few shelves. Unfortunetly, for all the people suckered into buying this CD, this album holds nothing fresh, and even worse than that: the same-old, same-old is mind-numbing. The producing by Kedar Massenberg is pure garbage. I'd call the music bad R&B, rather than hip-hop. The beats are more often off, than on. Not to say, that A+ doesn't have talent. He can rhyme, but he needed somekind of guidance rather than making a run for the money. With a good producer, this kid could've rocked big time. Too bad it went down like that. Although, check out the song with Canibus, ""Boyz To Men"", it's a positive exception on the album. Download it, do not spend your money on this album."
1,bitter not...,"It makes some sense for Cher to record an album of standards. She hit on a few that worked back on her TV show, and there are hints of the right sound in some songs like ""The Way of Love."" But to really sing the standards, you either have to invest your life in them, like a Rosemary Clooney, or -- like Linda Ronstadt -- study like a monk and train like a triathlete. Cher did none of the above in putting most of these disasterous recordings together. Add the tricked-up arrangements and you've got the worst collection of standards I've ever heard. I love Cher, but this is the least successful combination of singer and genre since ""Merman sings Disco."" Nice cover photo."
2,A pretentious collection of allusions to great writers.,"I finally forced myself to attend to Bellow! I listened to the tapes!!! I had a difficult time trying to determine whether Bellow was pulling our legs or whether he meant this work to be taken seriously. He mentions every person who wrote something that would fit into the ""great books,"" but never clarifies any meaningful concept that would be found in any of those works. Bellow had to be kidding us when he describes his sexual fantasies. These are the fantasies of a 50+ character who is supposed to be a great intellectual?? No wonder they have come up with Viagra!!! And what is all that stuff about communicating with spirits??? Is that supposed to be serious, as well. No -- Bellow was trying to do for novels what Stravinsky and Picasso did for music and painting.... One big put on!!! It must be!!!"
1,Pretentious Nonsense,"Charlie Citrine was such an incredibly tedious character that about three quarters of the way through the novel I just started skipping over his pseudo-philosophical detours. Like another reviewer mentioned, I often times would be unable to determine whether such deviations were written in a sardonic or serious tone. I came to really dislike Citrine's character by the end of the novel; sure, the guy has read a lot, but it doesn't seem like he's actually digested any of it. His thoughts and dialogue are nothing more than pretentious, name-dropping and theory-dropping gobbledygook. This man approaches problems both philosophical and practical without an ounce of logic or any attempt at coherence."
3,Overrated and unmemorable Novel,Clearly Bellow wrote beautiful prose and some of his passages in this are excellent. My problem with the novel is that I felt that I was wading through endless digressions and pretentious ruminations of the main character Charlie Citrine to get to the hidden gems. I struggled to finish this and frankly wouldn't recommend it. Citrine in the end is neither a believable or sympathetic character and his inner dialogue becomes a study in boredom. Since at one point he goes into great detail to discuss boredom in modern life maybe that was the point. I almost felt like the author was intentionally testing the readers ability to endure the pacing of this book.
1,Most disappointing!!!!!,"I expected much better from a tool carrying the ""Legendary"" Ingersoll Rand name. It has a voracious appetite for air, runs too loud and vibrates too much to be used for any appreciable time. Honestly, I really hate this tool, especially for the money that was spent on it. I bought much cheaper brands that work very well. After having this for so long its still boxed up and cuss every time I look at it. By the way it is ""Made in China"" so maybe that has something to do with the lack of quality."
3,NIce,"I love the Supremes material with Diana Ross. But this collection is worth buying for the material from the latter day Supremes. ""Bill, When Are You Coming Back"" is a wonderful sweet song about a girl missing her guy who has gone off to war. ""The Day Will Come Between Sunday and Monday"" is typical Motown fare (a good thing). The title refers to the day when she'll stop loving her man. Which is never since there is no day between Sudnay and Monday. As for some of the other material ""Popcorn Guy"" sounds really dated in a bad way. Does not have a Motown sound at all. But nice to have for collectors. As I said..it's worth it for the above mentioned '70's Supremes songs which have not seen the light of day on CD and for people like me who were to young to recall those albums make them all the more sweet. Also check out the '70's Anthology. Real nice collection."
4,Supremes Post- Ross,"Especially like the cd WITHOUT La Ross. Voices seem to blend together more naturally. Give me 'He's my man', 'I guess I'll miss the man' & 'I'am gonna let my heart do the walking' anytime. The last cd alone makes puchasing this box totally worth it. Am hoping & wishing all Supremes albums (Post- Ross)will be released on cd. It's about time!"
5,One of my favorite books,"Reading the reviews, I can understand why a non-knitter would not be charmed by this book. This book is by, for and about knitters. Whenever I'm bogged down with my knitting, I pick this book up again, seeking inspiration from 200 years of American knitters. The book is delightfully written, with lots of original source quotations, and allows us to peek into the day-to-day lives of colonial knitters, revolutionary war knitters, civil war knitters, depression era knitters, etc. It gives one a strong sense of women's role in American society at different times, reminds us (often amusingly) about fads and trends, and shows how wars shape lives beyond the battlefields. It's a wonderful book. My only regret is that it doesn't have more photographs of knitters and old knit garments."
3,An okay cover,"We bought this cover for our daughter's pool. It was what we were looking for in the sense that it wouldn't be blown off the pool by a slight breeze BUT....it did rip along 2 sides after only being on the pool for 10 days. I did do the return policy through amazon.com and the company emailed me saying they were sorry and they were sending us a new cover. We loved the fact that the rope goes down under the corners of the pool to help secure it. It does hold heat in the pool though. Even if you don't use the pool daily, you still have to remove the cover to allow the heat to escape otherwise the water will get slimy. But overall, I did like this cover just for the fact that it stays on the pool during a storm. They should figure out a way to make a screened vent in the middle to allow the hot air to escape though."
4,Very helpful and understandable with a few exceptions,"The concrete parts of the book (where the author reports historical events and quotes other people) are very helpful and very readable. However when the author launches into the abstracts (as he does in the first and last chapters) I had great difficulty trying to figure out what he was saying. It was as if someone else took over the writing and strung together a bunch English words in a way that made no sense. All in all an excellent book which gives hope for unification of the Church. I highly recommend it for the concrete parts, which make up most of the book. Just don't be too hard on yourself if your eyes glaze over during the first and last chapters."
1,Absolute Garbage!,"I dont know how they make these belts look so nice in the pics but trust me, these belts are cheap pieces of garbage. SAVE YOUR MONEY!I wouldnt pay more then $5.00 for these! The pocket is SMALL. I would like to see them fit 18-30 bills inside!No way! Again SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,REMINDER,"this doesnt come with the communicator part that goes in the controller, this is just the headset...and it sucks...you'd be better off buying one of the cheap ones, with the headset that wraps around your head, this one always falls out of my ear...in my opinion, a waste of 25 bucks...-Chris-"
3,It is way too small,"It is very small. It good for kids maybe. The earrings are very very tiny, the necklace is a littler bigger."
5,Swell sequel!,"Rachel reminds me of Stacey McGill from the BSC with a touch of Mary Anne(also from the BSC). Rachel is a math whiz like Stacey and has trouble relaxing like Mary Anne. She's dealing with her loud, obnoxious brother being back home from boarding school and her mother Nell is worried sick about him. Rachel ends up worrying about her mother. I liked how her friends Stephanie and Alison stood by her. Like Mary Anne, Rachel's friends tease her about being nervous. Also Rachel often feels self-conscious about her high grades and being a math whiz around kids who often ridicule ""nerds."" This book ranks up there with ""Just as Long as We're Together."""
5,PAYDAY CANDYBARS,IF YOU LOVE AN ABUNDANCE OF PEANUTS AND CARAMEL THEN THIS IS THE BAR FOR YOU. I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THIS LISTING ON AMAZON TO BE HONEST. I JUST HAD TO PURCHASE FOR MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT. PEACE.
4,Nice Product.,This product is pretty good. It arrived in a timely manner. It was easy to install and took me just a few moments to get everything organized. I drive a Chevrolet Avalanche and it fit perfectly across the bed. My only complaints are the cargo net is smaller than I I would have liked but I managed to get all of stuff in it.My biggest complaint while it isn't major is the release mechanism. It does not release or shorten the bar as easily as it seems on the directions. I'm thinking it would be a two person job. If it wasn't for that this would have been a 5 star review.
4,Fiction based on the real thing.,Very interesting and compelling. Much of it is based on the notes of a lady who actually lived through this experience and happened to run into Steinbeck and shared her notes with him. Her own book was not published until 2002 a year before she passed away.
5,fine piece of literature,"Amid so many people disliking this book, I love it. The length can throw off a few people, but when I decided to read it, it only ended up taking a few days. Steinbeck is brilliant and shines once again"
5,grapes of wrath - a book to make you remember,"I am no literary expert, but this book has to be one of the best I have read. Its depiction of suffering and the (sometimes losing) battle against adversity is something which should always be remembered in a country which likes to highlight that its ""American Dream"" is open to all. It is important not to forget what happened to real people in the past - how can we improve the present if we don't learn our lessons from the past?"
4,20th Century classic indeed,"The first John Steinbeck book i read, but absolutely not the last. The authors vivid descriptive language draws one into the world as it looked like in USA at the time. Being non-american it really helped me understand a lot of the time being - and in addition to the history-lessons ;) I also felt that i had spend a great time with a great book. Certainly a 20th century classic. I love it. Now you go read it."
5,The best preparation for the SAT verbal,"Forget about SAT success, SAT key and other useless stuff -This is the real thing. I raised my verbal by 160 points just after reading it (note that I didn't use any other prep material - just the book!) Considering the fact that I'm an international applicant, and English is not my first language - I guess any IVY-caliber kid should definitely buy it and make sure he memorizes every unknown word he comes across."
3,Not as good as OF MICE AND MEN...,"I read OF MICE AND MEN in high school and still remember the book fondly. I couldn't believe that I had never read more than bits and pieces of THE GRAPES OF WRATH and decided recently that I wanted to read this classic book. I must say that although I enjoyed the book and liked the characters much of the book seemed preachy and heavy-handed. The pages also seemed to drag on and on and on... Finally, I don't want to spoil the book for those of you who haven't read it yet, but the closing scene completely through me for a loop and will give me the ""heebie-jibbies"" for the rest of my life."
5,Grapes of Wrath,It arrived in new condition. There was nothing written in it and the cover was not bent of wrinkled. We were happy.
2,"although not the worst book i read, it is up there","ok so im a teenager so my thoughts are probably a little different than adults out there. I had to read the grapes of wrath for my junior year and i absolutely hated it..stienbeck did not keep me enticed and the plot was the same throughout the story..the story line waS pointless and although it was closely related to real life, the point of the story was hard to get at. the same things were repeated over and over and my mother literally had to sit me down and force me to read the book..i opted for the cliff notes..for all u teenagers out there...pick a different book to read and for all u adluts out there i dont know you probably would like it."
2,Immoral Preachers,Although Steinbeck is an accomplished writer I can't stand many of his books. The Grapes of Wrath might of had a powerful message but there were many things about it I didn't like. I have often heard The Grapes of Wrath called an analogy with Christ's life and the preacher portrayed as Christ. I think this is a ludacris analogy because the preacher was an immoral hypocrite. The sexual content and such took away the power of the message that Steinbeck was attempting to convey to his readers. So while The Grapes of Wrath is considered a classic I would personally choose to never pick it up again.
4,Where is the rest of it?,"This is a great book. I could hardly put it down.I was supposed to read it in college but somehow couldn't get into it back then. I was looking through some boxes and found the book. I read it every free moment I had. It was hard to get into it at first but after the third chapter I started to get it, then I was hooked. I felt very connected to the Joad family.I was pleased with the book up until the last page. I understood the message but was disapointed in lack of closure with the characters. I truly wanted to know what happened to them.Although it was long I would have been more than happy to read another 600 pages if I thought there would be character closure.I guess the author felt that if people during that time would lose track of their own family members we could sit back and wonder what happened to this family."
5,A Great Political Story Without Any Politicians.,"I read this one long summer after having read Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged. Both are marvelous stories, that interweave the author's political bent so well, that they each could be text books for a political theory class. After reading both, I found myself questioning everthing I thought I knew. If you really want to challange your mind, read both then try to decide which theory you believe."
1,The book was boring,"There are some historical novels that are so interesting and tell the details of the past in a creative interesting way. NOT the Grapes of Wrath. This is book was boring, and the story became very unimportant, and it made me not want to finish the book. This is one of Steinbeck's worst books, and i hope no more high school classes will be forced to read this garbage."
1,A terror to any high school student,"I had to read this book this summer, and I am lucky that I got through it. It has no climax and no plot twists. Nothing to keep the reader intrested in the book. It just goes on and on. I know it has historical inportance, but how can anyone get though this book without falling asleep. I take comfort in knowing I will never be forced to read it agian. A school can only torture you once."
1,"I agree, but...","I was forced to read this novel for freshman English, and although in general I think it had an important message and theme, but, man, was it ever boring! I really liked certain passages and the theme, but much of it was told in such an obtuse way and focused on such minute details that I could hardly stand it. I've read books on genetics, i.e. no plot, no characters, that held my attention far better and used words more economically than The Grapes of Wrath. Perhaps if the novel had ended 400 pages or so before it actually did, I could have stomached it better."
2,True American Garbage,"I'll give you good advice when deciding to buy this book : DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. The sole reason i purchased this book was for my honors english class, and i cannot see why this book would be used. This book would have a better purpose as a paperweight, it is so incredibly long, boring, and pointless. Well you still might have a desire to purchase this book. That is if you have become tired with the excitement staring at the wall gives you."
1,Cheaper Format is NO Bargain!,"I ordered this version for my new Kindle instead of the $9.99 edition because I didn't understand how file size could affect reading quality. There were so many typos that I had to quit after slogging through five chapters. I'm usually a fast reader, but this was miserable! Amazon was understanding and refunded my purchase price, so I plan to reorder the book in the larger file size. Steinbeck is a great writer and I really love the convenience of my Kindle. I only post a critical review to spare other newbies the bother of downloading the ""bargain"" edition. Spend the extra $2.00 and enjoy a wonderful piece of literature!"
4,A 20th Century American Classic,"The Grapes of Wrath is John Steinbeck's classic novel about the Joad family of Oklahoma and their journey to California in search of a new life. The Joads are forced from their family farm due to the Dust Bowl crisis of the 1930s. Once their farm becomes unproductive, it is foreclosed on by the bank and the Joads are left homeless. Steinbeck's classic is a depressingly honest look at the poorest socioeconomic class of the Depression. As the Joads move West to California and then try to assimilate themselves into a land where their kind is unwelcome, Steinbeck often pauses to observe the larger picture of the desperate circumstances of life for the common American of that era. The Grapes of Wrath is a beautifully written novel about an ugly side of life. While it is heart-breakingly sad, readers will appreciate it as a classic because it is so vividly real. I think most will come away from this story with a deep appreciation of where the United States has come from."
5,"This book is a perfect blend of drama, history, and emotions","This book is an amazing piece of literature which has made millions of people both think about and discuss this book, as you can see on this webpage. All those who gave this book under a four-star rating do not truly understand good literature and should stick to ""The Baby-Sitter's Club"" series."
2,"A good book, but Tedious read!!","I have to disagree with most of the reviews on this page. The book is no great American novel but it is not piece of sh*t either. I had to read this book for my 11th grade AP English class and in general I like the book. It has strong themes, great characters and lots of symbolism. The Grapes of Wrath is more important as a political work that gives an overview of the Great Depression than as a literary one. The details do get very tedious. I had to read some chapters twice because I kept forgeting who the characters were. Once the Joads start their journey all the characters tend to blend together, especially the male characters. Steinbeck also tried to throw a few to many symbols in. It got so bad that I got a headache trying to find the deeper meaning in Tom using his own urine to heal a cut. In the end though all you can do is get through it. I doubt very much theres an American highschool student who hasn't read this book>"
4,John Steinbeck: The Grapes of Wrath,"Hello!I'm Betti from hungary, I need for a help. I'Ve read the novel, The grapes of wrath by John Steinbeck and I need a very good title or idea about which I can write a 30 pages long essay connected to this novel. If somebody has a good idea please send it to my email address: rothbetti1@freemail.huThank you very much!"
5,grapes of wrath,"This book demonstrated the cruelty that we, as human beings, can demonstrate on one another. But, it also shows the perseverance of a strong family to maintain the family life. Steinbeck brought out the reality of life in this book that we can still find going on today. This book could easily be held up as a major reason for the downfall of the human race."
3,Important but dull,"First it goes w/out saying that yes, I am a high school student who was required by her teacher to read this book. And although that put s me at a somewhat biased opinion I am still entitled to it and it is a valid one regardless of what some of the older generations who like to lable all teenagers as having ADD. The book has many flaws but one saving grace. It's important in the sense that it gives a great insight to a period in history that many prefer to ignore or forget. But that's it. The story line is as dull, unengaging, and and long as you could possibly imagine. And if anybody has a problem with my opinion, tough. Like I said before, it's mine and I'm entitled to it."
3,Old Tapes,Yes the tapes were used ... old ... even distorted in places (I had to have some one read me the last twelve pages because the cassette was so worn it would not play). None the less ... it was wonderful to be able to hear John Stienbeck's classic read aloud. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
5,brings back memories,my hubby wore this loooooooooooong time ago.we had been unable to purchase it at local stores.so i decided to buy it on line.we received is quickly.Love this cologne on my hubby.Brings back memories just smelling it.
1,Awful,"I got a vial of this as a Xmas gift a few years back. I personally dislike the smell, it makes me nauseous, and I mean that not just saying it to further degrade the product. If you're looking for a men's fragrance by Claiborne, try Mambo instead."
1,Unfortunate Cookies,"I love fortune cookies and was very dissapointed when the case of cookies arrived with about 90% of them broken. They are not individually wrapped and had expiration dates of August 2007, needless to say I returned them. Very stale and crushed. The brand was not Beverly Sakura, It was Wing Hing Noodle Co."
5,Try This!!!,This Cd Rocks!! I Think It Was Overlooked. This Cd Is So Great I would Recommend This Cd To Anyone!! This Cd Starts Out With Trouble And Ends With The Hidden Track Hooker!! Its Great Everyone Should Give This Cd A Chance!!
1,Pat Benatar lite,Pink has found a way to get over with a limited vocal range&play with styles in Her own way.now She is trying to get into Pat Benater territory here&it's not working at all for me.this Album seems by the numbers&Linda Perry is more closer to Diane Warren than cutting edge as it's been lead to believe.
1,SKANK,"WOW PINK is ust another a no talent skank(Avril, britney, Cristina, jessica, ashlee)....who knew...."
2,Over-appreciated tosh,"Annoying, trite, and painfully over-exaggerated.That is all. This short review is about the perfect length the book should be."
1,Why is the Kindle Version More Costly Than Paperback,I cannot understand how a publisher can justify charging more for the Kindle version than paperback. It leads me to believe that as e-readers dominate the market place publishers are opting to gouge us with higher prices. It makes no sense when you consider they do not need to print or transport the books. So why the higher rate? Pure greed that ultimately hurts the authors because readers like myself refuse to buy the book.
2,Garlic and Sapphires,Book was listed as being in good condition; I would have said fair since it has quite a bit of water damage.
2,A bunch of old food reviews,"I LOVE RR in general and have read all of her books, but this one was a big disappointment. A huge part of the book is old food reviews and the rest is the stories of the disguises she wore to restaurants and how she came up with them. This wouldn't have been a bad book if there had been less of the (now very old) restaurant reviews and more of the story telling surrounding them. This just felt like filler between publishing a greatest hits of old articles."
4,Such a fun read,"Reichl's wonderful food descriptions, mixed with recipes and clever disguses is a fun read for foodies. After finishing this one I immediately read ""Tender at the Bone"" her first book about her childhood."
1,Why is the Kindle edition more expensive than soft or hard cover?,"The book might be fabulous but I will never know as I want to purchase the digital edition. However, the digital edition is more expensive than the soft cover version or the hard cover version. That seems ludicrous and unjustified and I will not be purchasing this book. Also, 13$ for a book which is a few years old? Why?"
4,Interesting world of New York restaurants,"I agree with others that the idea of her dressing up and going to a restaurant does get tedious, it needed a little something more. The side stories aren't very involved and don't add much. However, she is a food critic and she writes about the food in such a way that it keeps you captivated in the book. Reichl also places much value in her reviews on the way that people are treated, despite their age or looks, in a restaurant. We find that this is hard to come by in New York. I hope restaurants will learn a little bit about the importance of providing everyone with excellent service. She also includes several recipes in the book that aren't overly complicated, I just bought all the ingredients for a recipe in the book called Aushak that I'm super excited to try!"
2,"Great idea, bad technology","The idea of this flashlight was great, in case of emergency you can get a light without worrying about out of battery, but you will need to shake until your hands off in order to get it charge. Imagine if you are in a car and stuck in snow, and you want to use the flashlight to get some notice for help, you can just forget about it, I mean, if you save up the energy you use to get it charged, maybe you can live even longer to wait for help."
1,did they sift this mix?,I just tried to transplant a bunch of seedlings into this mix. There are A LOT of twigs in here... bigger than should be in a mix designed for starting new seeds. How hard is it to sift mix guys? I would not buy this again.
3,Messy,First a word about the packaging. There are little holes in the bag to prevent moisture build-up. Soil will work it's way out of the holes during shipping. I ordered this with a few other items and they all arrived with soil all over them. I'd suggest you order this item alone... It also seemed to have more sticks and rocks that I would have expected for something that is designed to be used with small seeds.
4,Great headlamp,"I've used this lamp a few times now and so far it's been a great headlamp. I really like the green light for temporary use when walking in twilight. Having the top strap really helps stabilize the lamp. The light is not the brightest, but is plenty sufficient."
1,Not the best description,"Not at all what I expected. I was looking for a light to be worn while riding an all terrain vehicle without head lights. This is not the option. If you only need to see vaguely 20 feet in front of you this may be your thing, but otherwise avoid."
3,A long history of existence to the community....,"_O.K., having been a member of the Society for 16 years now, my only question is this: what does anything in this book REALLY have to do with the current organization? There are a lot of noble ideals expressed here, but I have yet to see how they connect with the reality of the loosely confederated social club currently known as Mensa. This is like the corporate charters of most companies that I've worked for- meaningless boiler plate that nobody ever bothers to read._Like the ""Delta's"" in the movie ""Animal House"", all Mensa can really claim from my experience is ""A long history of EXISTENCE to the community....""_The introduction by Asimov can be misleading. While it is true that he had a life membership, I understand that he had pretty well broken his contacts with the organisation before his death."
5,A Disney Classic,"Purchased as a gift for a 14 year old girl who as it turned out loved the film more than the more up to date copy of it. Comes with 1 and 2 releases 1961 and 1986.The price was right, the delivery fast and damage free and the DVD played well"
5,Exceeded my expectations,"I already knew that the 1961 version was a charming classic, but I hadn't seen the Parent Trap II. It was alright, but I don't think it's destined to be a classic. After watching both of them, I was satisfied with my purchase. But then I got to the special features disc, and was pleasantly surprised: interviews with a much-older Hayley Mills, explanations of the special effects they used in 1961, a few clips of ""Uncle Walt"" (Disney himself), Tommy Sands and Annette Funicello singing the title song, interviews with the female ""double"" used in a few scenes, etc.I'm glad I have the whole package in my collection."
3,The First Is The Best!,"I, like others who reviewed this, didn't like the second version, but loved the first one. I think Hayley MIlls is wonderful, then and now!"
5,Indeed,This is a great older movie duo and certainly an asset to my vast collection. Arrived faster than a speeding bullit too!
3,Parent Trap II is disappointing,"Although we loved the original Parent Trap, Parent Trap II doesn't come close to the quality of the first. Viewing once is tolerable, but it isn't one of those we'd like to watch over and over."
4,Excellent if somewhat dated.,"The calculations are essential, the thinking superb, the objectives truly exciting. Some of the technology noted in this 25 year old classic is somewhat dated, but its easy enough to update that data on your own. In short, a very worthwhile reference manual, and written without the a priori commercial motives found in much of the current literature."
1,do not buy this item does not work,"My dog was diagnosed with kidney failure. The vet swore by this product at $60 a bottle. My dog only continued to get worse, then he suggested a saline flush for $350. He stated this would improve kidney function tremendously. Finally a thousand dollars later my dog dies and he states there was nothing he could do. The bottom line is if your dog has kidney failure keep him or her as comfortable as you can, because once there diagnosed with this terrible disease there is really nothing any of us can really do, not even azodyl."
3,Good Product - Poor Shipping,"The product is fine and the company ships promptly. But the product needs to be kept cold and not enough cold packs or insulation were provided so that, even though I paid for expedited handling, the product arrived warm. Since there is no way to determine its condition just by looking, I am comcerned about quality - or lack thereof."
3,Azodyl Review,"My 11-year old dog was recently diagnosed with kidney disease, unfortunately many older dogs and cats develop this disease in their mature years, but Azodyl is one of the nutritional supplements that is supposed to help the animal's body to better digest and dispose of protein, phospherous and other toxins that may make the liver and kidney work overtime to eliminate.So far, my dog seems to be responding well to a daily regimen of Azodyl, Epakitin and Kidney Diet dog food formula which is made by different brand names including Science Diet and Purina."
1,Azodyl great/Entirely Pets bad,"I had an online chat on Saturday with Entirely Pets so that I was sure the Azodyl would be shipped on Monday. I was assured that it would be and placed my order. After the online order status showed that it wasn't shipped yet on Tuesday, I called. The rep said that it was shipped on Tuesday but the status was not updated online. I kept checking the status and it finally said the Azodyl was shipped on Wednesday, after I made the call. The product arrived in melted ice packs on Friday. Two days is a good ship time, but the fact that I was lied to twice is a little unsettling. I do not recommend Entirely Pets for this reason. However, Azodyl is an amazing product. I've been giving it to my dog for 3 weeks and her BUN dropped 60% and her Creatinine dropped 20%. Of course, other treatment was involved but my vet thinks the Azodyl is a contributing factor in her recovery."
5,Excellent as usual,This is only my second Farberware coffee maker in 20 years...maybe more as I can't remember as the first one is very old. They are very high quality and fast! Consistently make great perked coffee and if lasting 20 years is adequate for you than I highly recommend this product. I have preferred this type of coffee maker to drip machines for the durability and space saving size and everyone always comments how good the coffee tastes. Me I'm just used to it and think everyone elses coffee is inferior.
1,DO NOT BUY,"I have bought this percolator not once, not twice, but three times. It's terrible. It doesn't last more than six months. Don't waste your money."
4,Faberware Stainless Steel 8 cup percolator Model 280,"Over all this is a good pot and does not require nearly the counter space that the Mr. Coffee type coffee machines do. It is faster than those coffee machines, easier to keep clean, and does not require the use of Lime Away to keep operational. This is the second one I have purchased and the reason for that is Faberware does not allow customers to change parts (one nut and 2 screws max to change anything). The earlier version of the Model 280 (4 years ago) had a stem that was 1/4 inch longer which would not allow the stem to tip under the rim (problem if dropping basket in and using a paper filter)and it does not leave alot to grab when pulling the basket out. The older models also did not require a full rolling boil in the pot before it began to perculate. In spite of the repair parts problem I will probably buy another one when the thermostate in this one quits."
2,In Need of Replacement unit,"I went through an extensive review process before choosing this item. Within six months after purchasing the item through this medium, and using the item less than 10 times, I am having problems with it. The unit refuze to work! The electrical cord tested O.K. (tester), thereby leaving the suspicion that the unit is not working.How, on earth, do I get a replacement unit without having the original box to ship it back to the manufacturer. Otherwise, the coffee from the unit was good and the versatility of the unit was adequate to use. I need an answer."
2,Favorite product,"I've been a Farberware user for several decades. Have used other brands but none can compare with the Farberware percolator 4-, 8- and 12-up versions. The problem is they don't last forever....but then what does."
2,very disappointed,The cord is short and the top is extremely hard to come off. When you are finally able to pry the top off there are wet coffee grinds everywhere...
1,Lasted only 2 1/2 months,"We bought this percolator because of its great reviews on amazon. It has been high maintenance from the beginning, but quit working this morning after only 2 1/2 months. We contacted the manufacturer and found out this is not even being sold any longer and they are refunding our money. Kudos to them for good customer service, but this product is terrible."
2,Do not buy one,"I will make this short, Makes great coffee when it works. But this last one only lasted 10 months so that makes 3 of these coffee makers in 5 years.this one is still under warranty but try and get thru to them."
4,New 8 cupper,"Had to replace my 30-year old four-cup machine but found that Farberware is now importing these from (guess who) China. Took a chance with it anyway due to Farberware's reputation. Been using it daily for two months now and so far, so good. It makes a quick, delicious cup of coffee just like my old American-made one. The handle on these bigger ones ought to be mounted on both ends...don't expect it to last very long. I'd recommend but ask me again in a year."
5,Love my new coffee pot,"If you want hot coffee just for a couple of people this is the pot for you. My wife was just tired of having the big Mr Coffee sitting on our counter when she only really needed 10 cups of coffee a couple of times a year. She says ""this percolator is beautiful and makes a nice addition to the kitchen"". One thing to be careful of is the coffee gets really hot. I don't use any cream or milk so I pour mine before making breakfast. My wife uses milk so hers is just right as is."
2,Was good for a couple years...,"Now the maker stops prematurely, leaving the coffee weak. I'm having trouble finding parts to fix it.Also the pour hole is too high. Sometimes it's hard to get the coffee to pour out...almost like the air needs a way in. So you have to tilt it a lot. When you return it to the counter, coffee goes through the grounds again."
1,coffee not hot anymore after 5 months of use,This is the second and last Faberware coffee pot that we buy. The first one we had a year and that one almost caused a fire. My husband plugged it in the wall and it shorted out. We bought this one that we have now at the end of August 2011. The other day my husband who always lets me make his cup of coffee said - hey you aren't making the coffee good anymore. Well it turns out that we think the thermostat is gone. Five months!!! We have only had this for 5 months. The coffee is barely warm even when you let it sit for a while. A couple of years ago we had a GE percolator and it was great - we bought it at Walmart. We can't find any other brands besides Faberware to buy now though. I am going to call the customer service line tomorrow to see what can be done about this. If they send us another one maybe that will buy us some time so I can find a good brand. These percolators should last years! Wish me luck in finding a good brand!
1,Stopped working within a year...,I bought this in April and in November it stopped working... It does not heat up the coffee as it perks any longer. I like to buy perk coffee makers because they are easy to clean and there is no mystery holding tank in the back that you cant see and is probably gross (My mothers bunn coffee maker quit working after many yrs and I took it apart and it was disgusting inside). I will continue on my search for the perfect coffee maker - Farberware is not the way to go.Update - They did honor the warranty - Costs 7.50 for shipping plus you have to send in paperwork and part of the coffee pot. Lets hope this one lasts. UPDATE - The new one they sent me seems to be failing as well... coffee now comes out pale and you have to pour it back through the grounds to make it taste right - VERY disappointed in Farberware's quality.
1,Cuts of brewing too soon. Weak coffee,This was a replacement for a very old Farberware coffee pot -same size and works find.Our new pot does not perk long enough so the coffee is very weak and not very hot. Result is that it is totally useless and it's been more than 30 days so we just lost the $... and I cannot seem to find any e-mail web site for Barberware or even an address/phone number.Richard Duxbury ....
4,The Best Coffee,"I bought my first Farberware Percolator about 3 years ago.That one only lasted one and a half years. I went back to a drip machine but could'nt get used to the flavor. I then purchased another Farberware and I have been very happy since.I love the taste of the coffee. While I realize nothing is made to last anymore, if my current one dies I will soon replace it with another Faberware Percolator."
4,Ditch the drip!,"After years of drinking not very hot and not very strong drip coffee I thought I would try a perc. OMG! Hot rich coffee! Plus its not some cheap plastic machine that is going to have to be replaced ever couple of years and it takes up so little counter space. I love it, get one!Update, after about 8 months the perc is still going strong. Since I make 8 cups every day (leftovers go into an iced coffee pitcher) the unit tends to need cleaning often. I use Brew-Rite about every two weeks. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that it is kind of hard to see the cup markers on the inside of the pot. The lid is hard to remove but I think that might be so it doesn't fly off while perking! Whether this lasts 2 years or 20 I do know it will last longer than the last five drip makers I have had with all their plastic parts and tubes. Since this is a one piece unit I take it with me when I travel and don't have to deal with the crappy drip makers at hotels or family."
4,Always a hit with my parents!,My parents have had many Farberware coffee pots and hope they continue to make them. People rave about their coffee. I have decided my next coffee pot will be a Farberware.
5,Love my new percolator,"This is my first percolator and I must say it makes the best coffee. It's so hot, which I love and also brews the coffee nice and quickly. The taste is great. I am tempted to get the largest Farberware for when I have company over."
5,Great Coffee Percolator,The Farberware Percolator is everything it promises to be. I bought an eight cup percolator and in eight minutes it is ready. I highly recommend this product.
5,Farberware Percolator,"I have had this percolator for about 5 weeks and I LOVE it. I have had no problems at all. I love the fact that it turns off after a certain period of time, not that I really needed this feature as I drink all the coffee in no time!, but it is a good feature to have if you forget it is on. It makes a great cup of coffee, I wish I had purchased one years ago."
5,"Farberware 4-Cup Percolator, Stainless Steel",This is the third Farberware 4-cup stainless steel percolator that I have had over my 50 years of keeping house. It is a great product! I have another expensive Cuisinart coffeemaker but much prefer my handy little Farberware 4-cup. I also own the same percolator in a 8-cup and 12-cup model and much prefer these coffeemakers to other makes. Farberware makes a great product which I highly recommend.
5,"So far, so good.","I've tried many different ways to brew good coffee, but always return to stainless steel and Farberware. Plastic and aluminum give even the best brews that yucky aftertaste. This one not only brews a great cup of coffee, it keeps the remainder at just the right temperature so that it doesn't become bitter in a few hours. Keeping the pot full and ready for company works perfectly for me. Now I need to see how well the pot holds up to daily use. So far, so good."
5,Good Coffee,Very pleased with my Percolator. Just the right size for 1 or 2 people.Went thru alot of different brands of coffee before i realized it wasthe way it was fixed. Perked is best. The way i remember good coffee tobe. Filters make easy cleanup too. Perks quick and stays hot.
1,Bad Product,Last 3 Farber machines stop making hot coffee////ONLY good if you want luke warm coffee after 3 months use OLD Models...with blue logo were good...Since China took over ..terrible...DONT BUY
5,Great Product,"The Farberware 8 cup percolator works great. I use it so much that this is my second. Very fast, easy to clean! You should buy it :-)"
2,Doesn't get hot enough -,"This is my 2nd Farberware - My 1st one lasted about 3 years after replacing the thermostat.The 2nd one lasted about 18 months - the thermostat went - I replaced it,and it worked again,but like the 1st one,the coffee is not piping hot when it is done perking.When it gets down to about 2 cups,the coffee then gets hot,but until then,I have to put my cup of coffee in the microwave to get it the way I like it.No more Farberware for this household !"
3,farberware coffee pot,"This is not your mother's coffee pot! Farberware pots used to be made of a heavier metal, this new pot is much lighter and feels, well, cheap. Although the coffee is made quickly, the pot does not have the same sturdy feel that they did 20 years ago. The lid fits VERY tightly and can be difficult to remove. Be careful, as this pot does not have an auto turn off that many drip pots have. if you have become used to that convenience, just be aware....."
4,So far so good.,We're hoping this percolator lasts longer than the last 12 cup we purchased. After reading the other reviews we chose this one and have been happy with it so far. The coffee's hot and enough for two or three people. It's easy to clean and attractive. No complaints.
1,Poorly Made,I bought this pot for my mother. After three weeks the handle came right off the pot. It's a good thing she wasn't burned. The handle is not screwed on. It cannot be fixed. It is attached in some cheap fashion by a fastener.
1,Bad dripper.,"Coffee pot drips badly from the spout while pouring a cup of coffee. This must be new design, for we have had several older ones that worked fine"
1,Great until it wasn't,Quit working after a few months of infrequent use. Was well taken care of. It worked great while it lasted but I will not order another. I'm tired of appliances that quit after a short use.
2,Not so good,"This is our second Farberware coffee pot. Seems Farberware's quality has taken a dive. I read the review where the lady got shocked from her Farberware 12 cup peculator. Same thing happened to us. Our GFI outlet began to trip intermittently when we would make coffee. At first I thought some water had gotten inside the unit but I disassembled it and found it dry. So I temporally disconnected the ground from the unit and found that the pot was 50 volts AC above ground but only when the unit got hot. Obviously power through the thermostat or heating element is contacting the metal pot. Unfortunately I can't figure out which one is at fault, so I plan to replace the thermostat and see if that fixes the problem. This is our last Farberware anything."
3,"Love this pot in the past, but now made like junk!","Bought this coffee pot over a month ago and already not perking correctly!!!Sending back to company for a new power cord, what a pain!!!"
1,Percolater -Farberware,"Made good coffee for about 10 days and then the base fell apart and all the electrical wires were exposed ... No coffee in the morning ,not fun.."
1,Not Built To Last,Do not buy this product. My wife and I had a Farberware 8-cup percolator for over 30 years. When it stopped working we purchased a this 12-cup percolator. It lasted less than three months before it stopped working. Farberware replaced it with a shipping cost of around $10 to us. But the stipulation was that they would not be responsible for any further problems. The replacement stopped working after six months. Do not trust this product to provide lasting value.
1,disappointed,"I have owned Faberware coffee pots for 30 years and always loved them. So I just ordered a new, Farberware FCP412 stainless steel pot and have they ever cheapened it. Much cheaper stainless steel, they changed the insert, so it does not go down in the pot, it pours extremely slowly, but the topper is, the edge of the lid is so sharp that I actually cut the side of my finger on it. I am very disappointed that they had to make such cuts to be able to sell their pot for 50.00. I think I would rather have paid a little more and had the quality we had years before. This pot is NO bargin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,excellent,first purchase on amazon. excellent choice. prompt delivery. My husband is delighted...Again a DELICIOUS cup of coffee.
2,went kaput in 4 months,"This the the third of this style coffee pot I have had over the past several years. The first lasted a few years, the second maybe a year, our final model started malfunctioning after just 4 months. We replaced it with a hamilton beach model -"
1,Farberware percolator not like they used to be,"My original Faberware percolator dating from the 1980's provided many years of service. When the heating element finally gave out, I purchased what I thought was the same product in 2009. The first percolator I received had a cracked steel basket which was promptly exchanged by Amazon.com. The replacement pot lasted all of 8 months before the plastic housing which holds the prongs for the plug cracked and the prong became buried inside the housing. It can not be used. These new percolators are made in China and they are junk. I am so disappointed that this is not the Farberware product of years ago. Save your money and DO NOT BUY THIS WORTHLESS PIECE OF TRASH!! I'm trying to find a coffeepot made anywhere but China."
1,Farberware: don't lose control of your quality!,"Dear Farberware: YOU have a superior product. I've been using these percolators for decades! Yes, I'm that old! Perfection is what you have always provided. Consistent. Quality. Great coffee. Not bitter. My latest (two weeks ago) four cup that I purchased on Amazon (because a friend put my old one through the dishwasher, imagine!...) went though one pot of coffee, and the bottom of the pot was LOADED with rusty pits! Not one, not two, but twenty five rusty, nasty pits! Exactly how thin is that stainless steel? Or is it? I love you Farberware, but get organized on your perfect percolators! I somehow don't think rusty coffee pots are the healthiest way to brew a good cup of coffee! Do you?"
3,Farberware 2-4 cup Percolator,"I purchased a new Farberware Percolator back in December because my old percolator was no longer functioning properly. I decided to stick with the same name brand because of its quality and how long it lasts. I am very pleased with the new Farberware Coffee Pot that I purchased, mainly because the coffee when brewed is nice and hot. There are however, two little things that I am unable to work out, 1. The lid is on way too tight and almost seems difficult to pull off, especially when you want to remove the filter before pouring a cup, your afraid that the hot coffee is going to come flying out when you are trying to open the lid...and 2. The electrical cord is different, it's now a 3 pronged cord and that is also so tight that I just leave it plugged into the percolator because it's a pain having to tug on the cord constantly to remove it."
2,"Happy at First, but not after 14 months","I love the design and stainless steel (no plastic taste). Enjoyed the coffee for awhile, but after a year we've been experiencing periodic short brew times producing nearly clear coffee. Seems that frequent cleaning, especially where the tube meets the bottom of percolator improves coffee perk. Pouring some coffee back through the top produces more flavor. It's a great piece of hardware, but the increasingly inconsistent perk leads me to give it a low rating. For daily use I'll go back to press coffee and use the farberware for parties."
4,OLD SCHOOL,Works good wife loves percolated coffee just as fast as the mr. coffee style machine keeps the coffeee hot good for abaut 8 cups
4,Older was better,"This new one is not made as well or as good looking inside and out as the previousones. The coffee ground cup top doesn't fit as well as the old one. The spout lookslike a last thought add on. It seems to do the job as well as the old one, which isgood or I wouldn't have bought another!"
1,Not the same quality as before,"Two of my cousins both this brand and in less than a year had to put them in the garbage because they stopped working after a few months of regular usage. I would love to buy a percolator, but will wait until I finish my research on the best quality one. It is my understanding that Farberware is not what it used to be."
1,Poor Packaging,The 1st pot that I received had a broken pour spout. I returned it for a pot with a smashed coffee basket. I think that Farbeware should take a look at the way that they package their products for shipping!
5,Very good,"I've had many Faberware coffee pots. I bought it because I like the way the coffee comes. It does seem to wear out quickly, though."
3,"Hey, Hope You Like Drinking Grounds","Makes good coffee, but you'd better have some kind of backup system in place to catch the grounds that WILL be getting into your coffee. Learn to either not take those last couple sips, or chew them. Ultimately because I did not want to learn to solder mesh onto the spout in some fashion, we switched to a drip maker and the perc has not seen the light of day since."
1,Rotten hearing element,This coffee pot lasted exactly 6 months which seems to be the expectancy . I have had several. Just bought another today. The coffee does not stay hot but while works is very good. It seems to have a rotten heating element.
5,A very luxorious bath!,"Very relaxing and luxurious. It smells like the ocean and turns the bath water a peaceful green color. It may be a little pricey for the bottle, but you only need a small amount for a bath, so it will last a while."
1,Poor,Super cheap thin almost scraps of wood from China. I had ordered 2 and only rec'd 1. Cancelled second before they shipped it out. It is in garage in original box. Totally too unpresentable to even re-sell at a garage sale $13+ wasted here. Never used this company again.
3,cheaply made,ok for a block but not if there would be any force. Like made out of Popsicle sticks but serves its purpose for me
1,not for small pets or children,"I was extremely disappoint on this item. I planned to use it for my cats to prevent them from going downstairs in my apartment complex. The instructions said not for small pets or children. So , I gave it away. If you have a garden maybe you can use it for that hbowever if small pets or not suppose to be near because they will get. hurt then you injured the animal.Also items very flimsy. I did not return it because it cost more to return."
1,too weak,"after one week, the item was broken. the nails connecting woods are too weak to break. it's not useful. I recommend not to order it"
3,Cheap but fragile,"It was Christmas and we had a new puppy. We needed to keep him away from the Christmas tree and out of certain rooms that had not been puppy-proofed. We ordered a whole bunch of these because they were inexpensive. They served the purpose, but they proved to be rather fragile. In particular the end pieces that serve as the stand tend to come off because the screws are too short and the wood they screw into is thin and splinters. A design issue prevents improving on this, since the slats of the fence abut on the end when it's closed. Thus there really isn't enough clearance to put longer screws or any kind of bracing."
3,not everyone's cup of tea,"The expanding fence I bought cost only a fraction of others I had seen in other stores or online. That is because it is very flimsy and not of quality construction. But you know what? It is exactly what I wanted. I wanted an inexpensive fence (barrier) to keep my daughter's pug from wandering into other rooms of the house. The dog has no desire to jump up and push it over. She is kept at bay (the pug, not my daughter) and I didn't have to pay a lot for the fence.P.S. The light material makes it easier to move about. Another plus. I'm thinking about buying 1 or 2 more."
1,expanding wooden fence,When I first received the wooden fence it had a broken foot and the slates were coming out. i had ordered one before this one and it was great i don't know where I got the last one from but i did let them know my disfactationd they credit my account. i can tell you this web site for writing this letter STINKS you type a letter and you have to wait at least 2 secondsbefore it shows also the package came without any partts to put it together with
4,Not so bad,"The fence works great to keep the chickens off of my deck, no more chicken poop ruining the wood deck. Yes, it is flimsy, it's made of thin fir wood or something similar to cheap lattice, but it is functional. I live in somewhat high country where we have constant wind, this week we had exceptionally strong winds, but the fence stood-up to the wind. I did have to build a latch of sorts to hold it on either side, but it is very light, anything this light would blow in the wind."
2,Poor Quality...,It is rather a flimsy produce that sort of gets 'weaker' as you use it...the two ends appear to sag after awhile.
1,Flimsy,"Silly me, I didn't heed the advise of the majority of the reviewers. This gate is so rickety that my 10-pound Maltese was able to knock it over the first hour. What a waste of money."
1,Horrible quality,This is the cheapest product ever. It feels like it's made from balsa wood. You can blow it over. If it hits the ground it'll splinter into pieces. This thing isn't going to keep anything held back. Pets can easily crawl under the gap between the bottom of it and the ground. Doesn't match the description at all. Don't waste your time giving this one a try.
2,Whitening soap review- 1st review ever!,"This is my very first review in Amazon, which I am doing from now on for any products I purchase here at Amazon, because I think it would really help people out :) The reviews helped me so I think mine would do the same for others.This soap works a little bit. During my time using it, I haven't gotten noticeably lighter than me normal skin tone- which is sand beige or medium light -_-Previously, I used likas papaya soap. It's an orange soap and it is a popular item in the Philippines. That now is reallllly GOOD and works wonders so if you want to get lighter, stray away from THIS product and search for the other one I just mentioned.Good luck :)"
1,Don't Upgrade! If your'e happy with your older version,"My new PC came with Money 2004. I was very happy with my old Money 99 but I thought I'd try it. I'm so sorry I upgraded! You can also download an 60 day trial but you'll run into the same problems. Once you upgrade you can never go back. If you're using Quicken or an Older version of Money, Money 2004 makes it extremely difficult for exporting data back to Quicken and there's no way back to older versions of money. On the Money 2004 FAQ, it leads you to believe you can, but you can't and then you find yourself 60 days in and find out you'll either have to buy or spend time reentering all your transactions for the last 60 into your older version. Don't Do it! Also 2004 is a subscription service so expect some features to expire."
3,No Need to upgrade from Money 2003,"I start using Money since 98. I was pretty happy since then. Last month, we upgraded to Money 2004 from Money 2003. After using it about 1 month, I would say it is disappointed. Even with the $40 rebate, I still don't see the reason to upgrade it from 2003. The ""New"" and ""Improved"" features are just too small in the whole application. I can't ""feel"" it when I am using it. Save your rebate postage and the money and wait the next version; if you plan to upgrade it."
4,Great Account of Important American History,"I read this book for a class on the history of Fundamentalism in America. The book was an excellent resource, and it often provided interesting theories about the development of Christian Fundamentalism in America. I found the history parts to be fascinating, and the interpretation of the history to be not as fascinating. Marsden's opinions about the facts were helpful at times, but confusing at other times. As a conservative Christian, this is a history account from an insider's view. Of the three books that I am reading on the subject, this book is the best of the three."
3,Mediocre,"This is one of the worst Buffy analysis books I've read. If you've been to a Buffy posting board or a lj fan community, you've already seen all these arguments hashed and re-hashed to death. No new insights are found in this book. In fact, many essays spend so much time re-telling plot points that arguments of any kind are barely made. There are a couple of interesting essays, but that's not enough to warrant paying full price. Pick it up used if you pick it up at all.This review should be 1 star lower."
2,Bloody hell,"This series of essays may be of interest to the most serious and cerebral Buffy fans. But Buffy was not a serious and cerebral exercise. It was the best of campy cheeky fun. The writers of these essays did not seem to get it.Granted there were life lessons and moral issues. Indeed, ""The Body"" may be argueably the finest 60-minutes ever broadcast on American TV. However the ""musical"", ""Thanksgiving"", and ""Xander's wedding"" were meant to be a hoot.Obviously, I was dissappointed by this book. If someone knows a more enlightened critique of Buffy, I would like to hear about it."
5,OUTSTANDING!,"""I paid particular attention to John Beal's performances of MEN IN BLACK and PREDATOR... I was a little skeptical at first thinking that these tracks might not sound right because I assumed that they were going to be played entirely on synthesizers. I listened to the tracks and was blown away. I thought that these were the best orchestral recreations on synth's I had ever heard.... I'm still amazed as I listen to those tracks right now. OUTSTANDING."""
3,Love is difficult,"Reece (Sam Shepard) loves Carol (Diane Keaton), and Carol loves Reece, but Reece can't commit to Carol until it's too late. Also, Reece's son, Tom (Robert Patrick), loves Katherine (Diane Lane) and, eventually, Katherine loves Tom. But, Reece has to step in and make Tom go after Katherine so that Tom doesn't suffer the same fate as he (Reece) does. On the whole, this little film, which was shot mostly in Lockhart, Texas, and directed by Pete Masterson, ain't too bad. The actors do a good job, and the movie shows us viewers a little more about the joys, sorrows, and complications of life and love. It's an enjoyable film."
2,"Tiny, not compatible with my rack","Firstly, this pack is super small. It claims to be a good camera bag but it's not big enough for an SLR with lens attached. It's not even big enough to hold a standard sized U-lock.Secondly, the product description claims it will mount to non-Topeak racks, but there was no way to mount it to my Blackburn mountain rack. I'll keep looking."
1,This book is not worth the Money,Sorry but I too agree with the previous review. The book sucked. It's so true but I did enjoy the recently published book. But this one was just not believable at all So if your looking for a book to read purchased his latest book.
1,this book should not have been published,"The upside of Terry McMillian's success is that we now have a variety of books about African Americans. The downside is authors such as Van Whitfield get published. I purchased this book because of the overwhelming great reviews that many of the readers gave this book. However, I found the book poorly written and very unsatisfactory. I am glad that I have a variety of black writers to read and I wanted to read a novel from the black man's perspective but that does not mean I want to read or pay for trash."
1,andersons fairy tales,What came under this title was actually J.M. Barries book Better Off Dead. Ihave tried To talk t customer service by phone and email. No service at all. I cant review Fairy Tales until I can actually read it.
2,PRODUCT INFO MISLEADING,"In the description it says the book includes the ""little mermaid"" it does not it also says that there is this great into by this famous Andersen analyst. there is not as it actually refers to a different hardcover than the one for sale here."
3,You can get crunk with this 3 1/2 Mics,"This is some pretty crunk and is kind of differant then there last 2 albums and is more southern influenced and has that definant crunk feel to it but was also more southern as I said. It also includes there favorite song of mine ""Whistle while you twirk"" but surprisingly that was not only good one."
5,Best collection of Bartram's writings.,"This is the best edition of Bartram that is available today.Like all Library of America volumes, it is an attractively designed book with a ribbon marker."
1,Creepy and bizarre. Yikes!,"I would give this 0 stars if I could. It seems to be a sponsored publication - ""Stop smoking, quit drinking, ease pain, depression, anxiety and more. [...]"" appears on the back cover and the URL appears throughout the book. In retrospect, I realize you can't tell from the Amazon info what translation this is. I bought it for class; it's the wrong edition. Mine is translated by the Benedictines of Stanbrook, even though I found this edition by searching on the ISBN number I got from the bookstore. Save your money! Just pay full price at a brick-and-mortar store where you can inspect what you're getting."
3,A Classic,"This classic, written centuries ago by the great Catholic mystic, St. Teresa of Avila, has been given a fresh, new translation by Mirabei Starr, thus making it far more readable for the modern seeker. St. Teresa's writing style can become somewhat difficult to understand; however, Ms. Starr has rendered it as clear as one could hope for."
1,"Translation? No, re-write.","If you want to know what St. Theresa wrote, DON'T GET THIS VERSION. I ended up throwing it away it was that bad.This ""translation"" is horrendous and has a clear agenda - it really represents a re-write rather than a translation. The ""translator"" tries to change what Theresa says by divorcing her writings from her beliefs. It removes concepts that are central to St. Theresa's spirituality - the teachings of the Church, obedience to one's superior, struggles with Satan, sin and evil.DO read a faithful version. I recommend the E. Allison Peers translation (published by Image). It is far superior and points out difference in past translations. The Peers translation is also available on Amazon."
4,PUNCTURED PACKET,"ONE PACKET HAD A PUNCTURE HOLE IN IT AND ONE PACKET HAD BEEN CUT OPENGood & Plenty Licorice Candies, 7-Ounce Packets (Pack of 12)"
1,Disappointing D'Rivera's CD,"I bought Tropicana Nigthts,expecting to hear a follow up album to the beautiful Portraits of Cuba. No dice.Tropicana sounds like warmth-over,dated cuban music.No imaginative charts,solos or material here.Too Bad. Bert Samuels"
1,ROUND NOT SQUARE AS PICTURED! NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS!,I only ordered these because the picture showed the square lollipops. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I love the square and heart shaped. The round are just too large and I could have bought them locally anyway if that was what I wanted. I better be able to cancel the subscription! I DON'T WANT TO RECEIVE THESE UNLESS THEY ARE AS PICTURED.
5,Fantastic work,"Anyone who claims to have any intellectual integrity should read this book. factual and truthful, very well done."
5,scary,"When you realize the agenda behind the radical feminist movement and how much control they have in everything law, government,and politics, it is very scary and certainly does not represent women at all, but a very angry group of women who hate men and have a incredible hunger for power.They just are never satified and they have come a very long way so they should stopall their whinning,it just gets so tiring to hear all the time. I for one consider myself a feminist, but certainly not aligned with this group that claims to represent women thank God!They have done more really to hurt true women then to help them.This book by the way is excellent."
1,*yawn* another Mein Kampf from the Reich Wing,"seems like these days on the reich-wing pundit/media celebrity side of things, you ain't nobody unless you've published your own little hate-filled screed declaring that the Enemy is Teh Gay, Teh Feminist, Teh Liberal, and anyone else who doesn't worship at the altar of Big Brother and King George.70 years ago, she would have been writing about the Jews.So here comes Kate O'Beirne to spread a little more hatred, cuz that's the way we do things in George W. Bush's America.(...)"
1,Don't give the author any more royalties,The author reveals her deficiencies by attacking the women who have made her own success in this society possible. Whattagal!
1,Intellectual Sloth,"Came away thinking Ms. O'Beirne, like millions of Americans, received a larger than anticipated credit card bill this month and needed the pin money. How else to explain an entire book containing nothing but 30 year old re-cycled backlash pap. Disappointingly all sizzle, and no steak - surely in our Internet Age, an author of Ms. O'Beirne's 'experience', could have cut and pasted something more closely resembling some forethought and originality.On whole, this is a self cancelling premise. Ms. O'Beirne and others of her persuasion have spent years and untold keystrokestypifying Radical Feminism as out of touch, fringers, imprisoned by anachronistic mindsets - yet here she is staking her treatise on this marginalized group somehow having vast and fundamental influence on our culture - Which is it Kate ?"
1,"A stunning, superbly insightful work of fiction","This book has an interesting cover with clever characatures of the usual suspects: Hitlery, Babs, Hanoi Jane, etc.What's written inside is crap."
2,As a conservative woman myself,"I really hate to say it, but this book was not all that great. It seemed to me that the author was just making extreme statements to sell a book. There was really nothing of substance in there to keep me interested.Call me picky, but I also found the spelling and grammer mistakes to be quite distracting. It seems that if you're asking people to spend money on a book, you would at least pay someone to edit it... It seemed to be put together on the cheap, and I found that to be Very unprofessional.I'll give her 2 stars for the theme of the book, but overall I felt that this book was a waste of my money. There are definitely better ones out there."
1,5-star example of logical fallacy,"""If even the biological imperative to, ahem, either stand or sit is seen as an example of the repressive `gender division' and a result of `conventional assumptions' about sex differences, it's little wonder that feminists reject the convincing evidence about the less immediately obvious differences in male and female anatomy, beginning with the brain."" (193)The straw man fallacy is a rhetorical technique (also classified as a logical fallacy) based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position; deriving from the use of straw men in combat training. (Wikipedia)"
5,Give it to the Feminazis,I'm so glad I bought this book. Kate O'Beirne gives it to NOW and others like them. Keep on writing.
3,This book makes a great,tool for the times when I need to punish the old lady for misbehaving.Recommended!!!
2,Disappointing,"I love the movie 'A Mighty Wind' and I consider 'Best in Show' to be one of my favorites, but 'For Your Consideration' doesn't come close. Look at other reviews for the plot details, but this movie is not worth watching; even if all you want to do is keep up with Guest's work. It just doesn't come together like his previous efforts."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:For Your Consideration manages to deliver some laughs but becomes so mean-spirited in the end that it leaves a bad taste in the viewer's mouth; unlike Guest's previous ""mockumentaries,"" which ridiculed people but loved them, this is the cinematic equivalent of a misanthrope."
1,Worthless.........,"I am a HUGE Guest fan. I have loved each and every movie so far....this one however SUCKS. If you are an actor in Hollywood, you may understand some of the inside Shtick, but for us regular people it just plain sucks. Instead of spending $20 on this piece of garbage, take that $20 and buy one of Guests earlier movies...Waiting for Guffman, or Best in Show. If you alreayd have these movies, buy yourself a nice lunch, at least you know you will enjoy it while it lasts. In fact, I would rather mow my lawn than watch this movie again. I would give it negative stars if I could."
1,My gosh was I disappointed,I made the mistake of only reading one review of this movie before I saw this and the only thing I took away was that it wasn't very funny. I have known and loved all the other movies Guest has made and so figured that it would grow on me.My wife and I watched with our jaws on the ground. This is not only not funny - it is depressing. The ending felt even more nasty and hateful than the original ending of Guffman (available as a special feature) where the characters were all absolutely miserable chasing their naive dream of celebrity.We were left feeling hollow and depressed after this and we had to throw on Guffman - just to make sure we weren't losing it - we weren't.Every filmmaker has a down moment - this is Guest's. Let's hope that his next film embraces more of the qualities that make his films so unique and fun.alec...
1,A Good Sleep Aid,Bought this movie based on the reviews I read. Probably be the last time I do that. This flick is so boring everyone (5 people)in the room was nodding off. If there was anything at all funny in it we certainly missed it. Was allowed $5 credit for it when sold it back to the store.
4,Great for Guest fans!,"I saw this movie in theaters and had to add it to my collection. It may not be the best of Christopher Guest's movies, but it rings some truth about Hollywood. Catherine O'Hara and Parker Posey make the movie very enjoyable. If you are a fan of Mr. Guest and this ensemble, I would recommend adding it to your collection."
2,Ouch,I had high expectations. I am a huge Christopher Guest fan...his humor is so different but this movie...yipes...I fell asleep.
1,The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen!!!!,I hate this movie big time & it Sucked!I remember when I went to the Movie Theatre with my older sister & her Fiance to see this movie!This movie was a huge disappointeed even my sister & her Fiance told me they hated this movie also.For Your Consideration didn't made no sence what that movie was about!When we saw this movie in the Movie Theatre we completely fell asleep.I'm definetly not going to waste my money to buy this Crap of what they call a movie It's Not Worth It!!!!And I Defintley Give this movie 2 Thumbs Down!!!!!
5,O'Hara Nails It Again,"So gifted and accomplished, Catherine O'Hara gives an Oscar-worthy performance. It's her film. It may be classified as a ""Comedy"", but this is a very moving film."
3,way above Hollywood's usual fare,"I think the people here seriously underestimate this film. True, it's not Spinal Tap, or Guffman, or Best of Show. (A Mighty Wind, however, blew.) But come on ... Hula Balls? Brilliant!The main problem is Guest and Levy didn't have the courage of their convictions. The film should have been titled Home for Purim, and should have been more Jewish. That would have gotten some real buzz, and a real and much deserved Oscar nomination for the extraordinary performance of Catherine O'Hara."
2,Clunker of an app,"Appleworks really needs a thorough overall. In the latest version, the interface under OSX sucks. Why, oh why cannot the document window automatically expand to fill the screen, and let's have a page layout view that makes sense.Word and Excel support is very inferior, I would suggest grabbing NeoOffice J or Open Office if you need to open Word and Excel documents.The good news is that the next version of Mac office will support xml format documents..."
4,Ever creating,"This is a great book thus far, that not only makes you think, but provides a better over-standing of numbers and the infinity of the Universe.... Alvin Johnson"
1,Don't Waste Your Time on this Book,"I bought this book because it was well reviewed. I have read thousands of books in my lifetime and this book is the most useless book of all. I would rate it at zero if this was possible. I tend to save every book I have ever read. I will not save this one. It is the ramblings of a poor soul. Even if you are into the occult, I don't think you will gain any useful knowledge from this book."
1,Cheap imitation,This is not the original group Los Terricolas just another group playing covers. The voices and music are lacking.
1,it won't run on xp,I installed the product. and it won't run on my XP professional!!!don't waste your money.
5,40 Day Mind Fast,"Michael Beckwith is a profoundly spiritual man and reminds us that each of us can benefit in real ways by our awareness that our oneness with God is the source of every conceivable good in our lives. He reminds us that Jesus is not the great exception, but the great example of how to live our lives if we are sincere about spiritual enlightment.I love this book and would highly recommend it."
4,Pretty Good,"Gulag I is okay, but Gulag II seems much better. I had a hard time believing this as a historical work, but (I guess) much of it is supposed to be true. The book is not for the weak of heart, and should be read by fans of the Russian Greats - Gogol, Dostoevsky, Chekov, etc. The book would be good for fans of philosophy and morality."
3,Mixed on Quality,"The card is nice and sturdy, but somewhat translucent. There are two gray lines seen on the front of the card caused by solid black lines on the back. Thes lines make reading the numbers on the front's left side more difficult. The card is the ideal Rosenbaum chart with rulers on the back otherwise."
2,Review,This item is very small for an eye exam. I had expected to have a larger chart for eye exam. I wish I had time to return this item.
3,"It's really, really, really small.","The mini flower press kit was just that, mini. It was part of a gift which included several items for pressed flower arranging so it was ok but again I stress, it is really small."
2,Ok for new players,"If u know how to play don't buy this. it just teaches u how to bet and what the odds are. also, during the betting part of the tape the dealer messes up twice on the pay out. (removing chips that were winners)"
2,Glad I only rented it!!!,"I am a huge Scooby Doo fan (actually watching the first season right now) but I am so very glad I only rented this movie before buying it. It was LAME!!!! The jokes were weak and the plot was well it was okay, just okay. I didnt really like any part of it. I have almost every other movie they have done but will not be adding this one. This movie is the only animated Mystery Inc. I feel this way about. I'm sure younger kids will like this movie but all of us here thought it was awful. I give it two stars just for keeping Scooby sluething!"
2,Feels rushed.,"Julianna Adams finds herself in a definite fix, drifting asea until Captain Nicholas Sidney rescues her. Neither realizes initially that the rescue will be on multiple levels and she will need healing beyond what her body requires to recover from the sunburn and other physical effects resulting from her castaway status. Her father, an American like her, is lost at sea with his ship, her heart has been broken by a suitor who spurned her, and her entire future is up in the air. Fortunately, much to his surprise, Nicholas and the love that she awakens in his heart, are exactly what Julianna needs. Together, they work to solve a mystery and find a new life.** Though this story does have much potential, it falls a bit short of realizing it. The mystery is injected awkwardly into the romance and the end feels rushed. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
4,The best italian song ever?,"I just have to say...Antonello Venditti's song ""Che fantastica storia é la vita"" has for me become the BEST italian song ever -it's amazing.So u think...why does this guy then only give the album 4 stars?Well the album ""only"" contains 9 songs...(incl.2 versions of Che fantastica...) but Im still only have listened to the first one..got it on repeat...Well buy it, and enjoy it: put the last song on repeat (long version)!!""Che fantastica storia é la vita""....U're right Antonello."
3,A straightforward introduction to Spanish fascism.,"A real page-turner until the unfortunate death of José Antonio Primo de Rivera, the playboy fascist whose colorful and violent rhetoric was balanced by good sense, style and charm. Payne's account of fascism in Spain before Franco is matter-of-fact and free of moralizing. The later chapters deal with the Franco regime through WWII, who the historian portrays as more of a capable, moderate opportunist than a dynamic fascist Jefe. Recommended as an introduction to the 20th century Spanish incarnation of fascism."
2,Not right for me,"I found the Streamlight 61052 too heavy for me. All adjustments did nothing to keep the lamp from falling down over my nose, and the weight of the item makes it difficult to use as a reading light. It might be just fine for you, and I hope it is, but I am still looking for the ideal solution to light up my life."
1,Decent headlamp but not durable or dependable.,This is a decent enough headlamp but after only about 10-12 hours of use the switch went out leaving me in the dark for the remainder of my dog walk.
5,Great Headlight!!,I bought this Headlight for my 9 year old nephew for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. My brother said he wears it all the time at night or makes them turn out the lights so he can see. Best gift he got this year!
2,Flawed.,Another Made in China piece of crap. Probably why it's half-price. Why can't the Chinese manufacture stuff that works pretty well. It took a vicegrip to get into the battery compartment. Did they think no one would ever need to open it or didn't they care? Thank goodness I wasn't out camping and needed to change the batteries. It would be dangerous in the woods unless you were carrying pliers as well as batteries.A rubber headband is included but to use it you have to cut off the elastic headband. You can't alternate between them.Amazon needs to put a Made in China warning on a Made in China product. Just so you know it's likely to be poorly made.
5,Great Product,Excellent product - nice illumination. I am a hard rock miner and sticking my head in dark tunnels the chin strap has really come in handy. Highly recommend buying. Fits over head or helmet.
4,Perfect for the gym shower,"I got these for the gym shower and they fit the bill perfectly. I appreciate the styling. Would also wear them to the beach, or in the backyard."
3,OUCH!,These flips were disappointingly ordinary. They were also a bit pricy for this quality. I would not buy more at this price.
4,"Great, odd but great",First time I heard these guys was at Ozzfest. The only thing anyone could say was WOW. The combination of latin and hardcore was mindblowing. The CD is a worth having in any heavy collection.
5,Vital to any CD collection,"This band should be HUGE!! The fact that it is not (they actually are not even currently signed to a record label) is a testament to both bad marketing and the general public's lack of imagination. This band single handedly created a new genre: ""salsacore"". They bring elements of tropical music, hip hop, jazz, and speed metal together to create what I consider a masterpiece. The variety and musicianship in this recording is impeccable. Some songs are so extreme that you don't know whether to dance or headbang. My advice: do both and buy this CD. You will not be dissapointed."
5,AWESOME CD!,"Puya is an outstanding new band that is just starting to get noticed. They have a unique style of music, its heavy metal, but with some groovy latin beats. I first heard of them at the Ozzfest concert and again at locobazooka (WAAF event) and they absolutely rock in concert. I don't usually mosh, but I couldn't help myself with this band, they are absolutely amazing in concert!"
5,one of the most original new bands out there today!,"well, imagine latin/salsa mixed with old school thrash metal meets rap-core with vocals ranging from limp bizkit to old school james hetfield (metallica, ride the lightning era) sung in spanish and english!!! you can't, so just buy the album to find out how good it is!! for fans of soulfly, limp bizkit, and neo-metal in general.... 5 stars!! and make sure to catch them at ozzfest this year on the 2nd stage (get there early)!!A"
2,Not Sproul's best,"I was disappointed since I have enjoyed other books by the same author. I don't disagree with the books doctrines, but it lacks depth and uses some faulty logic to illustrate some concepts, for example it uses a modern western court room scene to interpret the ancient mid-eastern New Testament. Try some of Sproul's other books first."
2,substandard,"Not a lot of clear explanations, not a lot of example problems, the example problems are extremely easy, then the HW problems are very hard. Topics organized in an odd way.A much much better book would be ""Algebra and Trigonometry"" by Stewart, Redlin, Watson. That book is awesome."
3,Advanced Mathematics Precalculus with Discrete Mathematics and Data Analysis,"The book is as advertized. However, the application it is needed for requires a solutions manual. After getting the book I am finding that locating a solutions manual is nearly impossible."
5,Response,"Sorry, Plano, TX, you reviewed the wrong album for the song you are talking about. Not even the same group!"
1,Just plain Sappy..Hill boy...yuk,"This is my first book by Lindsay McKenna and I can't say how much I disliked it.The plot was old and tired, the hero was made to sound like a country bumpkin and the heroine sounded like a earth mother with a college degree in wearing loud clothes.First few pages were promising, then it turned into a book that a teenager could have written, very immature, repetitive and just plain silly . The romance part of this book was so sappy I could hardly stand it. The plot was the overworked Tailhook Scandal reborn .I would suggest..oh never mind. I will never read another one of her books."
4,needs a little help,"I've been using MS Money for my personal accounts for years. I like it, and now after starting my own business, I especially like the price of Money Small Business compared to alternatives.The user from Western North Carolina (mmj...) pointed out correctly that the except for printing, the Invoices are not very professionally looking. He's absolutely correct unless you have the FREE PrimoPDF (from download.com) utility installed.This extremly handy utility (did I mention it is free!) allows you to save your invoice as a PDF file, that looks just the way you layed it out!Just select PrimoPDF as your printer, select the name and location of your desired output file, screen or file quality option and you're ready to rock and roll!This just made my day!!!"
5,Safina better than Bocelli,"The first time I heard Alessandro Safina was in the car on my radio when the soundtrack of Moulin Rouge came out.A movie I particularly detested which is beside the point.I heard Ewan McGregor singing Your Song and within the song an amazing richer,deeper voice was soaring over the top of him.I was so smitten with the voice I HAD To find out who it belonged to.I discovered it was Safina and have been in love with his mystical, Italian style ever since.His voice led me to investigate other more classical singers but they have never moved me the way his voice does.He seems to have a vital essence or timbre that is simply beautiful.I am always amazed when people have not heard of him."
1,Not useful,Information in this book is out-of-date and the techniques used are too simple. Doesn't contain enough information for experienced developers.
2,Replace Inserts Yourself,"The book comes in loose-leaf binder format, and there were numerous apparently revised pages that the purchaser must replace themselves. For a manual of this price, couldn't the publisher have inserted the new pages prior to shipment? I found this added work frustrating and time consuming.While most of the manual reads like much like a legal textbook as opposed to a practical guide (not many examples), the single sample private placement offering and exhibits were useful. But to be consistent with the loose-leaf, template concept, why wouldn't the publishers have included a diskette of the sample agreement to make implementation easier (again, given the price)"
3,"Good flavor, bad texture","These fortune cookies tasted great, but a lot of them were soft and chewy and it was hard to tell before you were already eating a bad one whether or not it would be one of the chewy ones. Not worth the $40 price tag, as I didn't receive $40 worth of cookies that came out okay."
2,A very disturbing twist on Star Wars,"I picked up this book looking to fill in the gaps between episodes. Unfortunately this is the only one between IV and V. At first I had a lot of trouble with the writing style, very bland and boring. Then the author began to throw his own imagination into a plot that was begun by someone else. Luke and Leia act like children and do not show the maturity they did in A New Hope. The authors characters seem to be totally different people. Next with the addition of Luke and Leia's foreplay, I almost couldn't stomach the implications. Even after taking into account that the author did not know where the story was going in later movies, I found his writing style difficult to enjoy due to its simplicity and lack of good character development. If you are looking for a good Star Wars read and not concerned with reading them all, I would suggest skipping over this one because the tone does not fit in with the rest of the saga."
4,better in '78,"There was nothing wrong with this book, except it was written in 1978, before The Empire Strikes Back. How could the auther know if Han Solo would stick around? That Leia loves Han? That Leia and Luke are brother and sister? That Vader can deflect blaster bolts off his hands and Leia can't use a lightsaber? And finally how was he to know that Vader was Luke and Leia's father? he couldn't, there is no way. Read the book, but from the standpoint of someone who has only seen the first movie. Because of a few plot holes I give this book 4 stars instead of 5, but it is still a good book and it is intresting, if you love Star Wars you'll like this book, ifyou don't, what are you doing looking at the reveiws for this book?"
4,"Interesting, funny and pageturner","Although it was written less than a year after A new hope had been released, it still keeps its freshness and attraction.The plot goes around the misfits Luke and Leia must go under while trying to help an old force-sensitive woman (never mentions she was a former Jedi) to get a powerful crystal that could enhance the Force.The story gets a little ""pink"" in my opinion about Luke and Leia, but how could you ever imagine they were brother and sister?And the end makes you chew your nails with the supposed ""first"" encounter between Luke vs Vader (actually it''s the second, the first is the one which appears in Vader's quest) and...Well, you'd better read it by yourself..."
4,Alf is awesome,This DVD includes the ALF Christmas special movie. The story begins when the tanners spend xmas in a log cabin and ALF ends up in the back of a truck going to a hospital. Then comes a touching story about ALF helping a little girl who is going to die in hospital. The reason I give this DVD 4 stars is because it also includes the ALF talk show which is not so hot. But anyway Alf rocks!!!!
4,great stuff,If you can finally get a copy of this album you won't be disapointed! This is the kind of stuff they made cd players for. Great sound quality. Makes you want to get up and boogie.
3,"OK, but with odd features","Agree that sound and reception are good. However, it has two features that affect its utility for me and are odd. First, you can't use it on a daily timer because it requires the press of the on/off button whenever the power is cut and restored. I had hoped to use it while away from home to make the house seem occupied. Second, it requires 12 volts *AC* from its adapter. Had it been designed for 12V DC, it could have also been used in rec vehicles and camping -- without an inverter.Eton Sound 100 AM/FM Radio, Blue"
3,"Good sound, so-so everything else","I got two of these on special for $30 each. The sound is remarkably full for a small table radio. There is a bass reflex port in the back of the radio. The FM radio is sensitive enough to pick up most stations without noise -- even those classical stations which always seem to be of marginal strength in most radios. However, the selectivity and image rejection is terrible. Not a problem for me, but could be for you if you have a weak station in the same spot on the dial as the image of strong station. I didn't try the AM.As a casual table radio, it does very well. If you can get it for $30, it's a good buy. However, some of the higher prices I see are a bit beyond what the radio delivers."
1,I just returned mine.,"The AM reception was awful.I was replacing an old Sony Dream Machine, but the old Sony handled AM much better.So I must give it one star.Also, the backlight was glaringly bright."
2,L.A Look,not that good doesn't stay up just save your self the money and get moca de gorila hair gel or gorila snot funny name but best affordable hair gel on the market
2,The worst flakes ever.,"I will admit this gel gives the best hold for my natural botticelli curls, especially in this humid climate I live in. HOWEVER after the gel has dried it turns into white flakes. The flakes are very obvious and big....it comes across as dandruff! For those people that have black colored hair(mine is jet black and never been any other color), the white flakes are more obvious and can even give the effect of my hair looking gray! I am 30 years old, so no natural gray hair yet. I am now using L.A. Looks Nutra-Curl even though the hold is not as good as this one."
5,Great book,Love Marshall Rosenberg's nonviolent communication skills & classes. This book really helps in understanding how to communicate gracefully and not confrontational
1,Disappointing,"The book was required reading for a class I am taking. Ouch--practically unreadable, and even less useful. I have studied communication for more than a decade. Nothing here makes sense to me--suspend judgement, how do humans do that? It's instinctual for humans to draw ethical lines in the sand, and according to this author, we shouldn't. I kept reading in hopes I'd discover something new or practical to use with my clients. I never did."
5,Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life,"This book has proven invaluable for opening communication with my spouse. Though it was recommended to us as a tool for anger management, I feel that this book is worth its weight in gold. I have been recommending it to everyone I know and have even purchased a few copies as gifts for friends. Wonderful work by Rosenberg!"
4,NVC,"This is a good book, and you get the gist of the material, although I have heard from people who have attended Marshall B Rosenberg's workshops or lectures that he is more convincing in person than on the printed page. It just seems hard to practice in a vacuum. But I'm going to try!"
2,"Useful skills, but poorly written","I didn't really like this book. Although the skills described are useful, the author's style is incredibly condescending and arrogant. I felt like a dumb child at the back of the class all the way through. And some of the examples given of ""real life"" situations are ridiculous. As if you would ever, in a group of people at a function, tell the person talking that you find what they are saying to be unnecessary and uninteresting. Well, not if you don't mind not having any friends or business contacts. Honesty should only go so far in my opinion. I'm sure there are many other better books if you want to learn some good communication skills."
5,Classic pie plate.,"My habit is to make about one pie a week. Of all the plates that have been used, to me this is the classic one that is perfect for the job. My pies are mostly the fruit kind. It is easy to clean and study. And it allows for even baking of the crust."
2,size,"I would like to put these on my rear tail light lenses, what size are these decals? and are they adhesive backed."
4,2 of Puerto Rico's finest,"Wisin Y Yandel are a couple of the most talented artists in Reggaeton today, that being said I had this album for a while and it didn't get a lot of play, then I saw the video for dembow on H-TV and I liked it, I got the cd out again and wow really started getting into it, I still don't like the first 2 tracks, I always skip to track 4 but from then on it's a great cd, a lot better than their solo albums, get this if you like reggaeton and get the party started!!!"
1,A Short Counter-Blurb,"Even I, an extreme enemy of the poetry establishment, was surprised by how poor this edition of the Princeton is. To find out how much it misses concerning what the best poets and poetry critics are doing now, read Richard Kostelanetz's Dictionary of the Avant Gardes. For more particulars of my case against the thing, you'll have to go to my blog. Oh, my recommendation to anyone already owning one of the very mediocre previous editions of the Princeton is not to bother with this one. It covers almost nothing new that is worth covering, and is incompetent to an extreme on the few new things worth covering that it does cover, particularly my own areas of expertise, visual poetry. (P.S., it doesn't know what poetry is, its entry on that finding it undefinable.)Quickly click the ""no"" button next to the question about whether or not this review was helpful to you now. The Princeton needs your help!"
1,not recommended!,"I agree with the review by James McCoy, avoid this one! This set is difficult to understand and not formated in a user friendly manner. My biggest frustration is the multiple lessons on each track of the CD - making it very difficult to go back and repeat just what you need to listen to again rather than all of the lessons in a segment. To follow their lessons as intended you would have to constantly go between the book and the CD, making it very difficult to make much progress while driving. I ultimately purchased another French CD to replace this."
1,Bike was stolen the 2nd time I used this,"The headline says it all. The actual chain is made from heavy duty construction and it's very long and easy to chain up. But the second time I used it, my bike was stolen in a pretty residential area in less than an hour. Both the lock and the bike were gone, so I have to assume they picked the lock."
5,Single and Single is a singularly successful story!,"Despite other readers' comments to the contrary, this newest LeCarre novel was a big hit with me. His best effort since A Perfect Spy (wherein we also examine the complexities of the father-son relationship), LeCarre weaves a magical story with twists and turns that leave the reader breathless. This is not a fast read--the character development and international intrigue are rich with detail and need savoring. LeCarre loves to jump back and forth in time; this device can be confusing at times. Nonetheless, if you loved A Perfect Spy you will enjoy this one too."
2,surprise ending,"Overall the story is an interesting read, but it seems to wander at times and there are a lot of subplots which don't seem to really contribute a whole lot to the main story. That's okay, but in the end you find yourself asking, ""so what happened to....?"" I found the end especially unsatisfying because it ended so abruptly as if Le Carre had just had about had enough of it already. Kinda disappointing."
1,where is this going,"A teacher at school recommended this book to me. I started on my flight home from Istanbul. I began the book over Europe and was ready to flush it down the toilet after the first chapter. The first chapter was full of useless flashbacks and empty words. I, however, continued with the book. The second chapter started better, but by the end of it, I was still confused. I, however, continued with the book. Are you seeing a trend? I read a lot of books and do not consider myself to usually be a tough critic. I also think I am a polished reader. I just didn't see where this book was going. I have stopped reading at page 130 and have started a different book. I will try to finish this one for my teacher's sake, but for no other reason. Mario Puzo is a much better author."
5,Microsoft Money,"I love Microsoft Money. I bought this version to save money. It is compatible with Windows Vista. Easy to use and keeps me organized. I have been a faithful Money user for years. I only use it to track personal finances so the low key, easy to nagivate program is perfect for me."
1,AWFUL PRODUCT!,"If I could give this ""application"" no stars I would.""Features"" within the application are nothing more than a direct link to several of Microsoft's websites. When I inquired about deactivating these ""features"", Microsoft's reply was essentially ""sorry, this is part of the software.""As an avid and loyal user of Money since 2001, I will be switching to another package or trying to find my MS Money 2001 disks.I already owned Money 2001 Standard Edition and expected similar feature sets in Money 2005 Standard....oops. If you want ""retirement accounts"", you need to purchase the 2005 Deluxe. If want the monthly Cash Flow forecast (like in Money 2001), that feature is GONE!This is nothing more than brochure-ware for Microsoft's web sites, YOU have to pay for it, AND M$ has the audacity to actually have pop-up messages built into the product ASKING YOU TO UPGRADE.[...]"
1,BOSSON'S BOOK,"This book was never received, no explanation was given except that the order was canceled; I was quite upset."
4,Not bad for the money,I bought this unit for my office and I find that it does a very good job. Two drawbacks are the angle of the clock (hard to see viewing angle; you need to be almost on top of it) and it does not fit the 2nd generation nano properly (very tight - I was worried that I might bend the pins inside my nano. I used a larger adapter that came with the unit. The radio's stationary so no worries about it falling out)But mostly I'm happy with the performance.
4,Hubby Needed This,"Gifted DH this book due to his persistent back problems, which are totally golf-related. He seemed to enjoy the book...we'll see if it helps."
5,Wish I had this book a long time ago,Contains suggested tip amounts and reasons for them. I will use it often. It includes many areas where most people do not think of giving tips. Such as garbage collectors.
3,may take some time,"I'm a avid baker and finally caved in to purchasing the Paderno World Cuisine silicone mats after stumbling across them at the PB/WS white sale, 2/$24 this past weekend, which is alot cheaper than the Silpats I've been eyeballing and I was tired of using parchment paper because they never tore easily or uniformly from their box. Used them to bake peanut-butter & chocolate chip cookies and noticed a faint burning plastic/rubber smell. The cookie bottoms weren't burnt, but it did set off the smoke alarms in my house, which has never happened with parchment paper.I'll have to give them a few more tries. If they keep making that burning plastic smell and setting off my alarms, I'll have to pass them on to someone else. Hopefully it goes well with making eclairs and macarons, I'd be so sad if they burned."
5,Don't know why I lived without one.,I will never live without a silpat again. Awaiting the purchase of my next one. So great! No regrets!
3,Not very powerful and I expect it to wear out soon,"It works pretty well and I'm glad to have it. However, the next time I buy a bellows I will search for something else.The ""leather"" on this bellows is rather flimsy. I'm not sure that its actually leather. After a month of use, its starting to show some wear. I expect that it will develop a hole soon and the bellows will need to be replaced.As far as power goes, I can blow on the fire just about as effectively as this bellows can. I've used more powerful bellows before."
3,Guadalcanal Diary,I was a little disappointed with this film as I was expecting a better portrail of the epic battles for Guadalcanal. However that said it was a good WWII war epic.
4,True Heroism,"In this video, a battle is depicted in which a marine and an enemy soldier toss a grenade at each other several times. It eventually exploded next to the marine. His name is John Szilagyi and he lived. His son was my best friend and I lived a summer in their house on summer vacation from college while working in their town. He was then and remains a man of distinction. His physical wounds remain but are for him, a badge of honor. I thank him for his gallantry then and for his upstanding decency as a citizen today. The video is worth the viewing."
3,Not worth the money,"This item was returned after one week. The CD player did not work. Bought mainly for the record player, which worked fine. Wanted a duel purpose system. Item showed well and we liked the design. We decided to purchase a different item."
4,Small but nice,This plant stand is nice and it is sturdy but it is very small. It will only hold a plant that is in a small pot and on a short hanger.
4,"Toshiba 3.5"" floppy drive PA3109U-3FDD","Easy automatic USB set-up and functioning as expected. Primary use is to read old 3.5"" photo discs from the 1990's when digital photos on disc were a newly introduced film processing option. This external drive was inexpensive when compared to purchasing and installation of an internal devise. Its compact and easily stored when not in use. As I've only had this for a month or so I can not atest to its durability."
3,Mediocre at best,Ms. Lamb has written some very good books but this is not one of them. The story is predictable and the characters are shallow so it is unconvincing.
1,ghost dog,"I've liked Forest Whitaker since (his bit part as a small-time hustler in) the 'The Color of Money'. But this is not a 'great' film, it's not even a good film. As much as I like Whitaker, he just can't pull it off. A deadpan expression and laconic demeanor is best left for Eastwood. What was that amateurish business with the sword and machete on the roof? Don't even try to hit me with that backhand.Read through the other reviews-- ""existential, quiet, surreal, delicate, understated""...ya mean, like frogs falling from the sky in ""Magnolia""? Yup, if I had to find an excuse for this movie, I'd use those words, too. And it's too bad--in a ""samurai movie""-- no one at least thought to coach Forest in the pronunciation of the word 'samurai'.If you really want 'samurai', watch Nakadai Tatsuya in the movie ""REBELLION"". Sorry, Forest."
1,Put Ghost Dog to Sleep,"This movie was a one of the worst movies that I have seen in a long long time, and I am a person who enjoys going to movies A LOT and I try to find the best in everything I see. My friend got up and left it was so bad. But I like Forest Whitaker and I was sure that it would improve. Boy was I wrong. Without giving away the ending, you don't care who live and dies in this movie but at the end you wish they had all died in the first ten minutes so that you could have used the time more wisely, say for getting your back waxed. How could this have a rating close to 5 is beyond my comprehension. Don't even rent this!"
5,Ghost Dogg,"Recommend to movie buffs and Wu-Tang fans, with great story and soundtrack this film also has great characters and Forest Whitaker is the man"
4,Still Deciding,"This is a neo-noir film that has a certain appeal. The music... the script... I don't know, but when I saw it a the theatre I really didn't like until it was over. But for some reason I would like to see it again. Rent it before you buy it."
4,A Man Movie,"Ghost Dog has it all, and leaves out the unwanted. There is no Ditzy female to contend for the camera with, and plenty of action. The story is based on the writings of the Samurai Code, and implements certain scenes using these edicts. The gangsters are very down to earth, being both flawed and cold hearted. If you love a movie that makes you think, and maybe a need to watch it more than once, this is for you. I have several favorites in this movie, and there is tongue in cheek humor to keep you from taking this too serious. Forrest Whitaker is very underrated in this movie, his character is well played, from the scared youth in the alley, to the defiant man in the final scene. I cannot stress enough how much this movie stirs something inside me, and it is a must have."
4,not your usual samurai movie.,"If ur a Forest Whitacker fan you will enjoy this movie. I love it every time i see it. This guy embodies the philosophies of the ancient text hagakure. This movie is fun to watch not to be taken very seriously, but if you like martial arts movies you should like this too."
4,Surprisingly good,"My boyfriend nicely lured me into watching this, and I loved it.I have seen Forest Whitaker in plenty of movies, but this was one of my favorite performances. I'm surprised it didn't receive more attention in the past."
4,A movie for the individual in all of us!,"Whitaker reads from a ""how-to-become-a-Samurai"" manual. Whitaker also spends a lot of time with pigeons. He further carries on a ""conversation"" with an ice cream vendor that speaks only French. Mobster Cliff Gorman extols the virtues of Flava Flav. Henry Silva and his gang, individually, are obsessed with watching cartoons. Silva's ""daughter"", Tricia Vessey, has prolonged passages of silence that seem to reveal the film's most enigmatic character.This movie is so heavy-laden with symbolism that each viewer will probably interpret something entirely different. Thus, it becomes either a delicacy or travesty, dependent on the observer.I, for one, thought it was delicious. But because of its abstractness, I couldn't quite give it five big ones."
2,long long long...,"This movie is full of clichés: all white people are racists or are being robbed; the gangster pretends to respect a samurai way of life but he's just killing, robbing, and kissing pigeons. There is nothing constructive in his movie, nor there is a real samurai philosophy."
2,Confusing and slow,"I saw this on a movie channel and was very surprised to find out later it was a Jarmusch movie. It's a pale [copy] of ""The Professional"" really, with only limited action and a lot of long sequences where the lead character just drives around. His whole life doesn't make much sense either; a rather overweight black man living by the samurai code with a small-time Italian mafioso as a lord? There are no real relationships to explore here (his best friend doesn't even speak English), and several side sequences that seem just thrown in for effect (a man building a boat on a roof with no way to get it down). The ending just seems to be necessary to terminate the movie. I never could figure out why the mafia guys wanted to hit the Ghost Dog character in the first place, or why they tried to hit his ""retainer"" and then take him back into the inner circle in the next scene. What? They changed their mind?"
2,Pretentious,"This is a pretentious film. It tries too hard to be different. The arty existential sequences try to be east European and fail, and the angst-ridden hit man is difficult to swallow. It's worth seeing once if you are interested in films, but that's it. Not worth buying. Borrow it. And then return it."
1,REALLY?,"I tried to like this but really??? The acting is horrible, the long pauses between action. Many useless scenes and dialogue. I couldn't remember seeing this film and so I watched it again. Will go on my list of never to watch or suggest to anyone."
2,Not very educational!,This book has great images but lacks the helpful information on how to light these difficult parts and pieces. It wasn't working for me.
3,NetObject Fushion,I am currently trying the NetObject Fsuhion version 5.0. This is really very good to learn how to design web pages. It is easy and fast.
4,uplifting music,"Malimba moon is tropical, happy music with an a nice assortment of instramentation. Great for excercising etc."
4,Decent Flavor / Very Easy To Prepare,"These beans have a good flavor and texture: the southwestern spices are subtle, but present. I like to jazz the beans up, but this isn't necessary. Add the product to boiling water and it's ready; I don't think there is a need to let it simmer for five minutes (if you're impatient like me)."
5,Excellent Book,"I loved this story!!! In it, you meet two generations of black women. You laugh and cry with both. The love story in the midst of the main story is beautiful and powerful. I could not put this book down."
4,Sci-fi not Smut,"I first read this book at least ten years ago, and I've read it a number of times since then and enjoyed it every time. This is not a steamy, more sex and violence than story vampire romance. It's science fiction, with well-thought out aliens who happen to be similar to fantasy vampires, and a very nicely done love story. I can definitely see how it might not be Anita Blake fans' cup of tea, but, honestly, comparing this to that is like comparing Anne McCaffrey to Sandra Brown -- so mismatched that any conclusions are meaningless. If you like science fiction, and enjoy a compelling love story, adventure, vampires (the author very neatly weaves vampires and aliens together with all the best parts of vampire tradition included), and characters who have more pressing concerns than falling into bed together, try this book. You won't be disappointed."
4,Curled up in a house in a different country...,"... I read this book. I could have been exploring the different ecology, the different culture, and instead I was exploring the world behind my eyelids.It hooked me."
5,The King of Blue touches the heart,"This is one of the best jazz ballad albums compiled. Davis' trumpet is so sensual and erotic within itself, it is only right to create a album of love and tranquility. The album's standout is without a doubt the live version of ""My Funny Valentine"". Davis' performance was absolutely amazing and completely soul-stirring. The tranquil ,""I Though About You"" is a mellow masterpiece. It is seemingly designed to have you reflecting on the person you love. The beautifully done""Old Folks"",at the albums end, stand as a testament to the long lasted beauty and immortality of love. Miles Davis' Love Songs is indeed a must have."
3,No tan buena como me imagine,"Aunque la historia es buena no se puede comparar con los otros que ella a escrito y en realidad no es mala solo que no es lo que me esperaba de un libro de ella, es una historia muy tipica de la gemela mala y la otra buena, aunque el final me parecio inesperado pero bueno no fue una total perdida de tiempo."
3,"One of the best ""one-sided"" records","Along with Bowie's ""Low"" and a few others I can't think of now, ""Blues for Allah"" has a great side 1; side 2, though worthwhile, never found its way onto my turntable that often. Yes, buy ""One from the Vault"" (vide infra)."
3,One Of Their Best Studio Efforts!!!,"This still remains of the Grateful Dead's best studio recordings. I know that they are the kind of band that are best appreciated live. I saw them live one time and it was after they had released this album. Maybe, that's why after all these years it is still among my favorite Dead CD's. The best songs are Help On The Way/Slip Knot!, Franklin's Tower, The Music Never Stopped, and Crazy Fingers. Only a true ""Dead Head"" will probably appreciate this CD...but, then again they probably already own it!!!"
2,DVDs are working - but the cases all waterdamaged!!,When I got the cases they were all wet. It didn't destroy the DVDs but I can't use the cases it ame with - all of then were destroyed and I had to cut through them to get at the DVDs.
4,Great videos,Just like the trailers show. They are 4 disc in series so 1 of them is only 15-30 minutes..But very pretty model/actress.. Would love to see a follow up dvd
4,Great 2 In 1 Product,I usually take Royal Jelly which you consistently take you fell your energy stays at an all time high. with this product also including bee pollen I get more bang for the buck than purchasing royal jelly alone
5,Great if you have a beard,I love Kiehl's and especially Facial Fuel Moisture Treatement that I have been using for years. In fact I got my Dad hooked on it as well. I have oily to normal skin with a light beard and find that facial fuel helps reduce the itchiness. My face feels more energized and fresh after using it. My skin is a bit sensitive and I especially like that there is no heavy fragrance. Nice to put on in the morning after the shower or before going out in the evening. The only thing that I would like is if it had an SPF. It might seem a little pricey but it's well worth it as you only need a small amount (size of a dime) to apply.
1,Twice the price of Kiehls direct,"I love Kiehls and this is NOTHING about he product, but in fact about the retailer.You can buy the same product direct from Kiehls for $21!! or the larger one for $30DON'T BUY HERE....."
1,More trouble than it was worth,"A few days after the sellers guarantee and the A-Z Guarantee ran out (30 days). The heating element stopped working, unfortunately I had no recourse to anyone. All I can say is keep EVERYTHING relating to the purchase so that you can contact the interested parties IMMEDIATELY should the item fail as mine did. I thought I liked the product, however by the time I located the paperwork I was past the guarantee period and now I have no Hot Air Brush and I am out $30, which included a $10.96 shiping charge. If I was willing to spend another $20 in shipping costs, the seller said they would send me another of the $20 item. My math tells me that the $20 item would end up costing me $50. At that price, I have to say it was not worth it. I'll look for another company's dryer that may be more reliable."
2,Would be a good product but...,"I have had two of these and both motors burned out in a fairly short period of time. The first one lasted longer than the second one but neither made it through a year. I like the concept so I found the same thing in a Revlon product that works just as well and doesn't have the same issue with the motor. If they would fix the problem with the motor overheating, it would be a great product. But as of now, I won't be purchasing any more Hot Tools products."
4,"Should have 5 stars, but.....","I love this brush! It gives me volume and a bit of curl and tames the flyaways. Why not 5 stars? This is my second - I felt the first one burned out too quickly. Still, I like it enough that I ordered a second!!"
2,Broke after 2 months,This product adds volume to short thin hair and dries it quickly. Unfortunately the motor died after on 2 months of use.
2,it's ok,"I've had this for a few months now.. when i first got it I was really impressed with it even though the brush falls off easily.. now I get frustrated because the brush falls off so easily. It's loud but it's the same as a loud blowdryer. I have to hold the brush while i'm using it & it burns my hand sometimes. I hate that i have to do extra work in the morning to use it. If I have time then it's good, it smooths my hair down & looks really good... but since I don't have time to mess around with it in the morning before work it's not that great. I thought it would be a good alternative to the instyler.. but it's not.. it's just ok..for weekend use only!"
5,You absolutely need this book!,"This wondrous work has been at my side, in my car, and on my bedside table since I found it quite by accident about two years ago. I have shared this book with Spanish students, native Hispanics, and English grammarians, all of whom have appreciated it as much as I have. I must agree with the other reviewers that the only thing wrong with it is that there isn't a part two, because in a language so rich with words--and diversity within its speakers--there are so many entries left to cover.The writer is gentlemanly,clever,humorous,and accurate all at the same time. Don't miss this one."
4,good movie,my husband enjoys these older movies and he really enjoyed this set. it was a good set. no problems with the movies. arrived quickly to my home. try these movies out you'll enjoy them too.
4,Wow!,"Ok, well it doesn't a rocket scientist to figure out what a funky album sounds like. Illya kicks the funk through the speakers on this one with some hip-hop and slows it down with a few songs on some ...like tracks. You know, like a Kool Kieth chorus, making you sing along when you know you shouldn't be. This album is in spanish, but good music only has one language. Dope cd none the less.Funky chessy breaks with illuminating vocals. Get it!"
4,Wow!,"Ok, well it doesn't a rocket scientist to figure out what a funky album sounds like. Illya kicks the funk through the speakers on this one with some hip-hop and slows it down with a few songs on some pimp-like tracks.

3,as for other EBTG collections,"As for other EBTG collections, this proves to be a must have just because of the tracks that you can't get from any other album.I also love that this collection includes some of their more poignant songs from the language of love album(my personal fave).A must for collectors and true blue tracey/ben fans. All posers would be clearly satisfied by the HOME MOVIES collection, which shows their more accessible POP side. This is a good collection before they went all dance music crazy on us. :(track listings: 1. Meet Me In The Morning 2. These Early Days 3. Come On Home 4. Downtown Train 5. Living On Honeycomb 6. Each And Every One 7. Night And Day 8. Almost Blue 9. Nativeland 10. Draining The Bar 11. Oxford Street 12. I Dont Want To Talk About 13. Driving 14. Take Me 15. Twin Cities 16.

2,HE WALKED BY NIGHT,"service was good from seller but picture and sound quality of disk was very, very poor ! i was very disappointed in the disk. i had seen the movie several times on tv and it was clear and good. i must have gotten a bad copy."
3,Cleans well but kind of cheapy,"This air purifier cleans the air well, and it's easy to clean the permanent filter. One drawback, though, is that it seems cheapy. After a few days, it makes an annoying rubbing noise. I returned it for a replacement, which still had the same problem. So I put some sewing machine oil at the top and the bottom of the spinning electrostatic cylinder, and that fixed the noise! It makes a typical fan noise when running, though, but that can be expected."
1,...,"Well what can I say about this movie, that does not include curse words. First off Jared Leto, horrable, he was in requime for a dream so you figure he knows how to act like hes high. But he just spits cliched lines and falls into chrismas trees.Cage was even worse because no one kills him, which leads to an even longer set of monologs. If you can put up with Cage trying to be Ben Stien for what feels like a lifetime I suggest you by thi movie.P.S. near the end cage blabs more facts about gunsales that you ever thought existed."
1,Worst film ever.,"I thought that ""The Hotel New Hampshire"" would go down as the ALL TIME worst ever movie. This one gives it a run for it's wasted money."
4,You must Choose Sides,This movie will make you think. This movie will not leave you untouched. Nicholas Cage is awesome as usual in a killer role. Must see; no matter what side you choose.
4,Fantastic Movie,"This is one of my favorites from the past several years. The story moves along steady, even though it isn't an action-packed thriller. The cinematography is excellent, the acting is great and the story is interesting. Nicolas Cage, Jared Leto and Ethan Hawke are excellent in their respective roles. I highly recommend!"
3,Passable pseudo-documentary mixed with deadpan humor,"An interesting but often slow-moving film that chronicles the exploits of a fictitious international arms dealer over a period of two decades. It is supposedly ""based on true events,"" and probably is -- but it's hard to believe all of those events occurred in one man's experience. The ""message"" (international arms trade is bad) is delivered in a fairly heavy-handed manner, but there are occasional moments of dark humor to keep the movie from becoming too preachy.The production is good, if you like deliberately flat and muted photography. Cage does a decent job as the protagonist/narrator, although I found the voice-over narration tiresome after a while. The overall consensus rating of 3.5 stars is about right; I went with three stars because half-star ratings are not allowed on Amazon and I think this is slightly closer to being a 3-star entry than a 4-star."
1,"Thanks for the nihilism, Eastern Europe!","Nothing more than a retelling of the Merry Melodies classic, ""The High and the Flighty."" In the 1956 toon, Daffy Duck sells torture devices to both Barnyard Dog and Foghorn Leghorn who have drawn the lines as if battling over territory -- or perhaps just intentionally aggravating one another -- in the manner of the ""Lord of War""-friendly Israelis and Palestinians (even so direct as Foghorn uttering the line, ""This, I say, this calls for massive retaliation,"" after getting hit in the head with a watermelon). Except that in the cartoon, the two warring parties eventually unite against the ""Lord of War."" Cartoon director Robert McKimson presents a much more optimistic view on humanity. Nicolas Cage should be ashamed that he signed on for such an unoriginal and weak-spirited project. Er, never mind, he's sort of left a guinea-pig turd trail of stinkers: ""Honeymoon in Vegas,"" ""Con Air,"" ""8MM,"" ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" and ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" just to name a few."
5,Loved the movie so much I paid full price on Amazon,Loved the movie so much I paid full price on Amazon. I love this movie for it's realistic and believable look at the irony of weapons dealing. It also points out the hypocrisy of certain democratic African countries. Also showed the hypocrisy of the USA that looks down on those countries. Also shows us there good people can do evil things when they have to.
4,Eye opening and disturbing,"This was more of a disturbing eye opener than an enjoyable movie for pure entertainment's sake. However, it makes a valid point, which may have been Hollywood's goal. The power of greed and the futility and brutal price of war. I would have liked a more hopeful ending, but perhaps the intent was a realistic lesson in political unrest and the hands that feed them weapons of 'mass destruction'.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
1,"Great movie, terrible product.","I enjoyed the film and would rate it 4/5 stars. However, this review is of the product itself - the film's Blu-ray disc edition. I have a Sony receiver, and watched the (Sony!) Blu-ray disc on my Sony PS3.The picture is great, but the sound mix is AWFUL. 50% of the time people are whispering their dialogue and you have to crank up the volume. The other 50% of the time, the soundtrack/explosions/other sound effects are so loud you have to really dial back the sound. It's as if the sound engineer had two buttons on his mixer - ""quiet"" and ""loud"" - with no dynamic range in between.Watching this movie was like watching a television show that only included used car ads.... ""whisper whisper BUY A NEW CAR NOW AT JOE'S CAR PALACE whisper whisper whisper.""Completely inexcusable. DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION."
3,Some of these nonfiction essays,could have been developed into a short story collection and it would have made better reading.
5,Red Oak Tool Chest,"This is a quality product, it is well thought out and easy to use. I like the fact that I can lock my tools when I must leave them, easily and securely. The drawers are a perfect fit for all the small tool used in watchmaking, and it looks very classy."
3,Good enough (if you're not too picky),"Vocally: weak (although this is to be expected; none of these guys can actually sing).Lyrically: kind of interesting in parts.Songwriting: adequate. I didn't hear a lot of variation. Nothing really interesting. The songs do tend to sound a bit alike.Guitar work: dull with brief moments of butt-kicking. There were a couple pretty cool riffs but, overall, pretty mundane.People seem to think that earlier albums are better (this is my first Hatebreed experience) but, based on this recording, I'd say that they don't have much going for them. I feel like I'm being generous giving them 3-stars (but I like the heavy stuff generally). These guys aren't great but there a bands a lot worse out there selling records."
3,"3 stars, gets better with multiple listens","When I first listened to this album all the way through I was disappointed. It sounded very repetitive, the lyrics were bland, and it didn't seem as if Hatebreed had anything new to offer. Since that initial listen I've probably listened to it all the way through ten more times and I've noticed that although there is some filler material on here that it's a lot better than I had originally thought. Still not quite as good as a Perserverance or Rise of Brutality and definitely not in the league of a Satisifaction is the Death of Desire but certainly not bad. Probably their worst effort to date but not bad, just a little too repetitive and plain at times."
3,Not a good fit,They must have listned because the instructions are now detailed as to where the batteries go. Unfortunatley I had bad batteries when it arrived and the trouble shooting details had instructed me to go and buy new ones. It didnt fit into my hatch so I sold it at a discount to a friend who could use it and go get new NiMh batteries. It's a pain to send stuff back!
3,An early Steinbeck,"In Dubious Battle was written before Grapes of Wrath, and when read you can see the later, and better book taking shape. Nevertheless, In Dubious Battle is definitely worth reading. The situation is interesting, the characters are well formed and the story is exciting."
4,The Nature of Cities ~ a Christmas gift,"My son was pleased to receive this book. The only issue I found was a raised nick on the outside binding. He didn't notice when he opened his present. Hopefully, it won't matter if he does notice. The book was shipped in appropriate protection. So, I surmise the nick/tear was there before it was shipped. I appreciate the expedient shipping. Thank you ."
3,Solid .... but rather dull,"This book was actually written not by the famous Leschetizky himself, but by his student Bree, and then later endorsed by the master. In any event, it is solid in the sense that it provides some basic finger exercises that are still useful and presents some basic good advice. The commentary is probably quite correct but generally does not really reveal anything new, neither in content nor in presentation. Perhaps the best part of the book are the illustrations of various hand positions. At the end there is also a perhaps historically interesting article by Paderewski. For finger exercises, I think Hanon is better and more complete, and for a method as such, have a look at Seymour Bernstein's '20 Lessons in Keyboard Choreography'."
3,Good But,"The characters are wonderful but the story drags along. Also, there seems to be a theme of sickness and death. I did read all three books in one setting and found myself wanting to read the last page. It just does not keep you interested."
1,"Flat, Unbelievable, Christianized, Soap Opera","I felt like I was reading a cheesy ""Lifetime"" movie with interjected scripture. Please. The dialogue is flat,unbelievable, and contrived. Why can't Christian book authors write intelligent, well-developed characters with believable dialogue? If I read the word ""tresses"" one more time to describe some girl's hair, I thought I would throw the book across the room!The Amish are romanticized, while the English world is there to give them car rides, deliver their children, and to steal them.Brenda Mailloux-Glidden"
2,"Interesting story, poor dialogue","I agree with the reviewer who longs for Christian fiction that isn't so forced. It doesn't seem like it would be that difficult to take a good story and make the characters (and their words) more believable. I could hardly get into this book...in fact I only made it to page 40 before I gave up. The story drags and the forced dialogue results in characters that seem flat and one-dimensional. People just don't speak to each other in long, drawn-out sentences like this author uses. One character actually refers to her own hair as ""my dark tresses."" Another good example of poor dialogue is the entire conversation that begins on page 28. It never ceases to amaze me how readers can overlook poor writing just because it is a Christian author. I am left feeling disappointed because I had high hopes for this series."
2,Made me sleepy,"This is a great book for people who don't want adventure or romance in their lives. For people who approve of staying home. For people who like to do chores.Do you know, the love affair between Naomi and Caleb was the boringest romance I've ever read? They never even kissed. These two are destined for a life of pious mediocrity.For people who approve of pious mediocrity, this is just the book for you."
4,Researching your wicker collection,We have over 40 pieces of wicker and have had a difficult time verifying the value of some of the pieces. Mr. Scott's book helps a great deal in establishing the authenticity and consequently the value. The photos are very defined and the descriptions adequate to determine the maker and circa of the wicker.
2,Had Potential...,"I really enjoyed the outline of the story as laid out in the book jacket -- it had such potential! But the writing needed editing AND the lead character was so inconsistent I don't think I could keep track! Also, at the very end (no spoiler since this will be vague), I was quite upset that the priest was more upset about this brothers actions than those of children! Disgusting! I don't know who to blame more -- the author or the editor because I think this book could have really been a crazy, wacky story with the right editing!"
4,Life in the 5 Boroughs,"There may be lawyer-client relationship stories that are as good as the Lincoln Lawyer, but there is none better. The characters and the scenes are vivid and the plot keeps you guessing and reading. The story has all the ingredients for an entertaining movie. If you like criminal lawyer stories, you will be delighted with this one."
4,great read,I read the Lincoln lawyer before the movie and after it. Great book realistic more thqn the average person knowsGRINDING IT OUT:How To Create A Six-Figure Law Practice
4,Surprised!,I was really surprised that I liked it so much. I'm not into mystery stories very often but this is a winner.
4,4 1/2 stars Audio,"Of the few audio novels I listen to a year, this one was pure pleasure. Not only was this a good legal thriller, but the reader was smooth. His voices for each character was recognizable and done with a skill few narrators have.A great story that was done well on audio.Highly recommended."
5,Keeps you readin',"This is the first book I have read of Michael Connelly and really enjoyed it. I got it cause I watched the movie a long time ago and remembered that I liked it, but ddidn't remember enough to spoil the book. Anyway, I loved the book. A good book is always better than the movie and this was no exception."
3,"Not Bad, But Not My Favorite","I think my main problem was I didn't like the main character very much. Mickey Haller is kind of an SOB, and that's intentional on the author's part, but I never quite felt engaged with him. I recognize that this is probably personal preference, but I prefer the Bosch books."
2,connelly gets lazy,"Having loved ""The Poet"" and other Connelly novels I was eagerly looking forward to reading this one, especially after the rave reviews I'd read. What a disappointment! It wanders around for the first 90% of the book, the plot obvious and the characters wooden, then picks up in the court sessions but can't sustain it to the end, which is melodramatic in the extreme. There are 2 or 3 pages of insight into lawyers' psyches, but the rest is, uncharacteristically, made up of ponderous dialogue and irrelevant and boring subplots."
3,"Stick a fork in him, he's all done",Micheal Connelly used to be a great writer......just the way Stephen Hunter was and Janet Evanavich and others used to be until the flame just ran out. Hate to say it but the man has no other stories left in him I believe.Of course he will continue to write more stories and they will become more sanctamonious as they go on and the characters will put everyone to sleep even faster. At least I didn't buy the book. I got it from the library after being disappointed by his last few books
4,Cliffhanger,Great story with a who submit you thought you had figured out until the end. I will read more of this author for sure.
3,Talutsa,Probably better than I thought since there is now a movie based on this novel. I found to be a bit tiresome in spots. Only MY opinion.
5,Extremely satisfying legal Thriller,"This book hooked me from page one and I ended up devouring it in 3 days. Smoothly and vividly written with a couple of wicked twists, and a great character in slightly amoral, but likeable, defense attorney Michael Haller. I highly recommend it!"
3,"Not His Best, But Better Than Most","Michael Connelly is a very good writer. His plots flow, he knows how to keep you reading with lots of twists and turns, and his research is impeccable. Unfortunately, while this book is a great look into the life of a not-always-ethical criminal defense lawyer, there are big gaps in the logic of ""The Lincoln Lawyer."" Without giving anything away... our hero is threatened by a bad guy, and the hero then proceeds to do nothing about it, even though it's clear the bad guy could show up again at any time. Also, there are many characters introduced in the first third of the book who have great potential (bike gang, Earl the Driver) but who never go anywhere. I will continue to read Connelly's books because his writing is far better than most of the soggy mess that passes for mystery fiction. But this isn't a 4 1/2 star book (as the current conglomeration of reviews on Amazon shows)."
4,Like Grisham but with more punch,Fairly intense drama based on a defense lawyer's client who turned out to be a serial killer. He forces the Lincoln Lawyer to free him from the charges against him. Arm chair gripping to the end.
2,Not sure why people like this so much.,"I'm not a literature snob, but I thought the characters in this book are flat and that the plot was not very exciting or suspenseful."
4,Lawyer in Love (with self),"This is a well written parable of greed and conceit, basically everything we expect of lawyers. Mr. Connelly fills his book with every rationale and every deceit the lawyers in LA live for and with every day. I liked the book even though I hated the character, despite his obvious intelligence he can't seem to get out of his own way. And as the book stumbles to it's inevitable conclusion wherein the hero brings the villain to ""justice"" he does so with little grace and wit. I hope there is no reprieve for this character."
5,Absolutely love the Cinnamon Altoids!,"I like the peppermint altoids very much, especially the mini-sized ones; not only are they a very good breath mint, but the ""smalls"" fit conveniently in a purse or pocket! The cinnamon flavored Altoids I love even more! The taste is great!"
5,Perfect for gift.,"I love this Cinnamon mint candies because this is the gift I buy for my mother every time I fly back to Indonesia. This product came in time as it said,and it was exactly like how it was described online. I love how it is packaged and sealed tightly so that I don't need to worry about it get spoiled in the bag."
3,So-so.,"We all know what a great singer Nancy's big sister Ann is, and that she (Ann) can blow most other female vocalists from here to kingdom come, but I must admit I'm foremost a Heart fan because of Nancy. It's really such a pity she never sang more of the Heart stuff, as I'm a total nut for her beautiful and soothing voice. (-Couldn't they've split the band material more evenly in the vocal department; 5 songs each, or something ?.) I wish I could've given this solo-album of hers 5 stars, cos' God knows she deserves it, but it's just not a very exciting live-recording. Even the collection of songs she's chosen could've been better, I find. - Hey, Nance; we want that studio album next ! ."
4,Raw and wonderful,"As an avid Heart fan, I couldn't wait to hear this and it didn't disappoint me. I only wish she'd played a little more rocky acoustic guitar... what she does so well."
3,"Nancy Wilson, McCabes","Nancy Wilson is a fantastic performer.This recording is terrible.The performance deserved better, because she is really putting on a great show. It is a shame that there is so much distortion and basically a lifeless recording of what was a wonderful night. Rate it 5 starts for the performance, and 1 star for the recording. Most of that credit probably goes to the mastering guys. Who knows what they had to do to drag a somewhat usable sound from the original tracks."
2,not very complete...,This book focuses only on certain techniques and material (timber). A bit disappointing.
3,"It's A Winner, But To Tell The Truth...","This CD indeed hits the jackpot with the original recordings of many of the most familiar themes from classic television game shows, primarily of 1960s/early '70s vintage. But be forwarned: Two of the tracks contained on this title suffer from significant audible distortion, plaguing the mid-section of the Password theme and the entire Hollywood Squares number with extraneous, muddy noise artifacts (likely that's what another Amazon reviewer was referring to when he described the sound of the Hollywood Squares anthem as being ""a bit washed out""). However, since this CD is the sole commercial release on which these themes can be found, it is, for those who've long sought these musical treasures of an era gone by, the (ahem) only game in town."
5,Great stuff!,"This is a solid, intelligent, heartfelt and rocking album all at the same time. Just to clarify the comment of the Amazon reviewer's mention of a ""nonsensical children's chorus"" on the title track, ""They"" -- if the guy ever listened to anything other than rock albums, he would know the track also contains samples from one of the most famous classical crossover records of all time: ""Going Baroque,"" the Swingle Singers rendition of Bach. Touches like this abound thru Gem's album, making it all the more satisfying.Another note: her song ""24"" is now featured in the just-released trailer for the movie ""Ultraviolet"" over at www.apple.com/trailers"
3,Okay,"I must say that I've been hearing great things about this CD so I recently picked it up. I hate to say I'm a tiny bit dissapointed. I think the beats are very good but I feel like the lyrics are bit too weak (Life, it's ever so strangeIt's so full of change) and her voice never really seems to change throughout the songs to accompany the change in rhythm.It's a well produced album but lyrically it could use improvement. I don't feel the pain in her voice that she sometims seems to want to convey through her music. A good CD but not what I would call 5 stars."
5,My favorite!,"I bought this CD under the ""used"" section and was quite impressed with the quality...no scratches, and the CD does not skip. Great to listen to on the way toschool if you wanna be in ""chill"" mode!"
3,Absolute vanilla,"Amazingly mediocre. Incredibly OK. Super allright. That's how this album strikes me. In places very good -- with ""They"" and ""Falling for You"" being standouts -- but in no way reinventing the wheel here. Most of the tracks here are fairly anonymous (all Dido comparisons aside) or just another case of ""reach exceeding grasp."" A very listenable album, especially for fans of semi-indie-type stuff (um, like Dido), but not anything you'll wear out. Bottom line: Pick it up if you like this sort of stuff, but don't pay full price."
3,Used to be a four but then I played it out,It happens. I think it's because there wasn't a lot of depth behind her music. I can be a sucker for the beat so that's what drew me in but after a while I got bored.
2,I Like The Misfits Better,"Boring. There are one or two good tracks on here but nothing Nelly Furtado couldn't do, or Dido for that matter - and both of them churn out snorefests so what does that say about Jem? Most of the album is pretty cheesy, and it gets surprisingly unbearable on the songs where electric guitars are introduced, forcing you to skip tracks and ruining the album even as background music. Look for this album in the discount bins two years from now."
3,A nice Sunday morning listen,"I have only heard a Jem song before and it is the first song on this album. I enjoy this album and several songs do stand out, but after repetative listening you realize that most of the songs have a ""sameness"" and the tracks blur into each other. She has a good voice, but needs to expand her material. I look forward to her future albums."
4,Groovies At Full Speed,"46 Flamin' Groovies cuts on one handy 2-disc set? Groovies fans gotta love it. Not quite sure why you'd want the 3-disc ""Bust Out at Full Speed"" since it actually has fewer cuts and costs more... maybe the liner notes are more extensive? More photos of the guys in their mid '70s pilot shades? I dunno... At any rate, this one's the bomb (as the kids say), though the sheer number of cuts could be too much for the power pop neophyte. Then again, this is a good place to start shakin' some Groovies if all you're familiar with is ""Shake Some Action""."
3,Escritor Aficionado Anonimo,"NO puedo efectuar evalación mayor por estar en proceso de lectura. Tengo que obtenerlo de nuevo, se extravio mediante un hutto."
5,Sublime,One of the best books that I have read!! The shipping was on time and the quality of the book was good too ... No complains at all!!!! excellent book!! I recomend it!
4,Outstanding,"The time period from the e-mail notification (when they notify me the item was shipped to me) to when I actually got the item was kind of long, but besides that, very good service."
2,Too expensive to treat a large tank,"I have a 55-gallon tank and the whole bottle barely moved the ph. Now I buy pool chemicals pH+ because you get 4 lbs. of powder for <$10 (Utikem) and it only takes 1-2 teaspoons of that to raise the pH of 55-gallons by 0.5. By the way, my pH problem was so severe that fish were dying. I discovered that for soft water like mine, add calcium to act as a buffer to help stablize the pH. The calcium I use is also from the pool supplies aisle at Wa...m..rt. Much cheaper. You just have to make sure to buy enough during pool season."
4,solid collection,"Let's face it, Johnny faded in the first part of his career, but made a miracle recovery with the American Recording series. Tjis gathers great early material and some so-so stuff, but feels less than complete."
5,JOHNNY CASH 16 BIGGEST HITS,"Since I was a child I have heard Johnny and June on the radio, had albums, etc. but had forgotten about them for awhile. Then I watched Walk the Line and was interested in learning more about them. Of course I went to Amazon to see what they had as I had bought from them in the past and was always pleased with the variety to choose from, the price and the quickness of receiving once I had purchased.I am very satisfied with what Amazon had to offer and bought several items. To know of the great love the couple had for one another and to be able to find a recoding of these great hits was very pleasing.I am very happy with all parts of my Amazon experience and rate not only it but the product as well with 5 stars."
4,VERY GOOD,"Good taste,but really small. If they could make them the same as the regulars thatwould be great."
1,Don't eat too many!,"These candies taste a little different than the real thing, but close enough. If you eat more than a couple, you'll be sorry... Unless you're constipated, then your problems will be over!"
3,If you like to HEAR your music,"If you like to really HEAR your music , I would suggest J.B.L or Altec Lansing possibly without any particular model in mind, You may need to take a trip to your local radio shack (sorry amazon)and hear for yourself... or get something a tad bigger and pricier if needed and get your self something that you can really enjoy: just image your favorite piece...not played in at least close to it's glory, and your not even hard of hearing just yet!"
2,Work for One Year,"The battery only goods for approx. 1 year, after that it won't hold charge anymore. I don't recommend to buy this product, add a few more buck to buy a brand name like duracell or sanyo."
2,Input voltage is only 120V for Rechargeable Battery charger,Input voltage range should be upto 220V which is not in case of this Rechargeable Battery charger.
2,Ten mile range or did they say 10 block range?,"I have the Motorola Talkabout 250 and the Motorola T6310 and wanted to get a radio with a greater range so I brought the Midland GXT400. It was advertised as a radio with a range of over ten miles, however, I think it was a misprint and they really meant one mile. I read a few reviews where the reviewers said that they got reception of over ten miles. I wonder who wrote those reviews? HHHHUMMMMM! If you are looking for a handheld two way radio with extended range, do not get the Midland GXT-400! I was definitely no more than one mile from my house when I lost reception with my wife. I tried a different route and still same result. I do not live in a canyon or in an area surrounded by skyscrapers. I live in an area where the houses are no more than two stories high and I could not get reception once I was more than ten blocks from my house. I am going back to my Motorla t-250's. Easy to use, lighter and same range!!"
3,A brief history of Wall Streets greatest Corporate Raiders,"An interesting history lesson describing the sometimes rags-to-riches, but more often riches-to-riches stories of some of the most well-known corporate raiders. You won't confuse any of these men with the character Richard Gere played in the movie ""Pretty Woman"", even though it was supposedly based on one of the men in this book. The author dedicates a chapter each to several men who used their wealth to add to the definition of ""hostile takeover."" The reader gets a good look at how a corporate raider goes about his work, but we never learn too much about the men behind the money.Although it covers a time period between the late'60s to the early '80s, it's still a relevant work considering one of the subjects, Carl Ichan, is still very much in the business today. His recent attempts to acquire Nabisco is just another in a long history of raiding you can learn about in this book."
1,Wormwood Tea,I wish I had known that this tea was so bitter. I added honey but that did not help. Can someone please make a suggestion as to what I can do? I haven't been able to drink it.
3,that morgage hangs like an anvil on a chain around the neck of Amercia?,"This movie is part of the new trend of ray traced animation movies.The ability of computers to make animated human like figures that movehas changed the way we see things in 3d.The plot is a clever ""goose bumps"" type plotout of camp fire stories about the demon souls that take over inanimate bodies.These kids fight the house and forge a bond ofhardship with each other.""Luke, blow that thing and let's get out of here""crossed my mind when the explosive went down the pie hole."
3,Inappropriate for small children,"From the preview I thought it would be a nice lite childrens ""scary movie"" and I got it for my 5 year old. I think it is most inappropriate and hideous movie for the children. It gets really scary and at some point it gets downright ugly.In all fearness my daughter loved it. But my daughter does not get scared very easy.I intend to ""loose"" this moview for a few years."
3,Eh story and good 3D,Story was below par when compared to better animated movies from Pixar and the like. The 3D was pretty good though. I could only watch this once as it really wasn't on an adult level at all and I do generally like most animated movies.
3,Not for the very litle ones,"Monster House uses an animation technique where the faces of the characters are made very ""human"" and this results in a sometimes disturbing feeling, especially when the characters are showing rage or fear. My kids got scared watching it and ran away (7 & 8)although I know some children are a lot tougher and can watch the insect scene in ""King Kong"" without getting the heebie jeebies. (Which I did). Certainly the animation technique creates a more intense experience."
1,Mean spirited,"This could have been a lot of fun, but like so many of the recent kid movies Monster House maintains a crude and extremely mean spirited tone. Awful for adults and kids alike."
4,luv luv luv it!!!,The movie got here faster than i expected & my four year old son loves this movie. Once again...im a satisfied customer!!!
2,Disapointment,"This dvd was full of things not suitable for children. There were kids drinking and asking about getting a beer. Vague refrences about one child's parent having an afair. This could have been a decent movie, instead hollywood needed to make it edgy so people would think it's great. It was a disapointment."
4,my kids loved it-and so did I,"Very well done movie. Not really a scary movie, but definately creeped my 3 year old out at times. My 7 year old didn't find it scary at all. We have had it just over a week now and they have watched it 3 times. Good movie for holloween for kids."
2,messed up,Came fast but was scratched up they cAlled to get feedback and I told them they said they would send another one in the mail that was 3 wks ago still haven't received it
4,good 3d,"This movie has some good 3d moments! really good quality! And the movie is not bad actually. Its not my type of movies but because of the lack of 3d movies i bought it. And i dont regret it. It was good and funny.If you are thinking to buy it, just buy it.:)"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this box to house a knife collection and some other collectables that belonged to my late father. After considerable research, I purchased the Gerstner 530 Red Oak 8 drawer tool chest. While this is a nice box, I was disappointed. The box is made in China out of plywood with a red oak veneer. It looks nice, but when opening the drawers they feel light weight. The drawers do not open smoothly and wobble. I prefer things that are solid and fill heavy, and this is not what I expected for $300. With solid red oak materials, this product could be much better."
2,terrible,"this book tells me1. author did very little research2. does not understand how to create a story / beauty / poetry with the subjects he is writing about3. probably did not interview many, if any, people who were involved in the history of aprilia4. someone needs to write the book that this one purports to be5. author wrote about trivia that was not interesting (to anyone)"
1,Your local SPCA will have a fit!!,"This was Herge's second book. It contains excellent pictures and scenery. However, the following incidents should have been edited out: 1) Killing of several deer. 2) Killing of an elephant, Gorilla and a Rino for feeble reasons Not recommeded for children. Only TinTin collectors need to bother about this book."
5,Forget Entertainment Weakly's Review!,"Brian Chin (who put this set together) is a man of taste. This is a box set not for people nostalgic for a musical fad, but for anyone interested in the history of r&b. There are timeless greats like Gloria Gaynor's Never Can Say Goodbye, or the frequently hip-hop sampled Got to Be Real by Cheryl Lynn, Forget-Me-Nots by Patrice Rushen (also often sampled) or Ain't No Stopping Us Now by McFadden & Whitehead. Anti-disco? It's not about totally irrelevant imitators like the BeeGees (which is why there is no BeeGees here) or John Travolta and Saturday Night Fever. It's ALL about r&b (but Entertainment Weakly wouldn't know about such things). The box is accompanied by excellent liner notes which explain the development of the music."
3,Much of the goodies...but too much esoterica,"I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could.Much of the key disco tracks are here, but the are often bobbing within a sea of sub-prime, esoteric tracks. I would rather of had the fat trimmed off so that we could have had the longer 12"" single versions of some of the better ones (like Chic's ""I want your love"" for example). You could fill one entire CD with the tracks that belong in the ""skip"" category."
5,This author really understands kids and parents!,"""What About Me?"" is a fun book for kids. The simple, vibrant pictures and text appeal to young children. The main character is cute but mischevious, like a real kid! My boys love this book. But what's really impressive about ""What About Me?"" is that it teaches children an important life skill without everlecturing or preaching. At the end of the book there's a ""Note to Parents."" I love the author's comments about 1) dealing with misbehavior by teaching kids positive ways to ask for what they need and 2) helping kids to feel capable by offering them choices rather than rules. ""What About Me? is destined to be aclassic!| | | | | Inbox"
4,Excellent music!,"I must say I had some trouble finding this album in stores. When the movie was starting, I could tell right away that Danny Elfman had composed the score. He has a history of creating haunting melodies as the underscore for films, and this was no exception. Haunting and repetitious (that's a good thing)this is one of those CD's that you will keep in your player for quite some time."
5,AWESOME,"My husband stumbled onto this group and its music on YouTube. We were so impressed (and highly amused) by its take on contemporary music that I had to order several of Gregorian's CDs. The CDs are all ridiculously expensive because they're imports; but if you love the unusual, and--if like my husband and me--you love Gregorian chant, you will find them well worth the money. My only complaint is that they are playable only on CD players--they are not playable on computers. This means I can't listen to them at work, which really bums me out. We sure play the heck out of them at home, though!"
5,Will Never Forget It,"I remember this film well,but in a hazy way....Merle Oberon after she dies, running with Laurence Olivier to gather heather she loved.To me , this is one of the top romantic classics...the cinematography was interesting and very artistic. Each scene seemed to be filmed to capture the feeling of that moment.Either Merle in all her brilliance resting in the sun, or the fading scene of these two lovers wandering off to the heather.I just cannot express rightfully the greatness and depth of this film.Love so strong it lives on after they've died.Highly recommended !"
1,"Wuthering Heights (Import,All Regions)",Bought this one with the white cover thought it loked okay but it was unacceptable because once looking at closely it has been pirated. Surprised to find the language to be mostly Asian on the back which they dont show you. Quality was fair at best if you can deal with the annoying Asian subtitles that cannot be removed. Disk had some scuffs even though it was purported to be new causing the movie to skip and basically unwatchable if you factor in all the negative aspects.
2,Why'd they skip so much of the book?,"Wuthering Heights, as a movie, was very good. Unless, you happened to read the novel. Then, don't even bother to watch the movie. They omit, in my mind, some of the best scenes from the novel. Where are all the children characters like Cathy, Heathcliff, and Hindley had? They played very important roles in the novel. They did an excellent job of remaking the first half of the novel, then they jumped to the end and completely skipped the second half. If you like romantic movies, but prefer not to read the novels, then you will love this movie. However, if you prefer to read the good ol' classics, like myself, don't waste your time on this remake; you will be very disappointed."
2,Wuthering Heights Is A Real tour de force,"As far as I can perceive,Wuthering Heights is honestly a real piece de resistance.Though the end of its major themes,love,passion,hate obssession and revenge is catastrophic, it's still the most enthralling,exciting and fascinitaing novel I have ever read in English literature. Regarding the characters,I think, my favourite one is Edgar Linton who loved his difficult-to-please-wife,Catherine.On the contrary,my most unfavourite character is the ingrateful,vindictive,ruthless Heathcliff. It's true that Catherine had made a mistake by marring Edgar,but she had paid dearly her own life for it.Even if you, Heathcliff want to wreck revenge on someone,it should be Catherine and only Catherine.Not,however,to extend your vengeance to the all family generations as you wickedly and spitefully did. In conclusion, I would like to say that though i have already read the whole novel word by word,I intend to read it again soon.It is worth ."
2,too melodramatic,"i've never read the novel by bronte, but based on this film it's hard to see why it'd be considered a classic. the acting and story are far too melodramatic to be good; i found myself laughing where i think i was supposed to be crying. nevertheless, i'm intrigued enough to check out the book to see what, if anything, was left out."
3,Wuthering HEIGHTS DVD from Amazon contact,"I really shouldn't write a review yet, because I haven't even taken the plastic off the DVD. But just a comment... It states ""Dubbing"" English. It also says, ""Subtitles- English, Korean"". So, I don't know which language the actors will speak; if Korean, it may be good for a laugh, as I don't know one Korean word! But I still want to see Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier act, no matter which language they speak! I may learn some Korean! Anyway, the product was delivered in a timely way."
3,"Good movie, but...",Don't have any razor blades in the house and keep your Prozac handy. What a depressing movie THAT was. The Great Depression wasn't this depressing.
2,I didn't enjoy it,"It was a tragedy, romantic, well acted, and well made. But I didn't get anything out of it. My idea of an intertaining movie of this type is Casablanca. I didn't care about these people. Maybe it's generational; I'm 34. too much overacting and violins(and I like violins)."
1,too small,This bag is too small. You can get as much in a big under-seat bag for far less than this bag and the rack system.
1,Far too small.,"I originally ordered this bag because we had purchased the MTX DXP bag and loved it. Because we don't need such a large bag all the time, we thought that this nice, small, road bag would work for other times, carrying more than the seat wedge, but still a nice small size. We were wrong; it carries about the same amount as the Trek 120 seat wedge and takes up more room. We decided to go for the larger Topeak RX Trunk Bag with Side Pannier -- it's great (and add to that, we found it here on Amazon for half the price!) If you are thinking about ordering this bag -- order the Topeak RX with Pannier instead! You'll be much happier with your choice."
2,Not for me.,"I was initially really excited when I found this cd. It's such a wonderful idea to put great poetry to music, esp. for children, as I think they find it more accessible. I previewed the songs online and wasn't very impressed, but figured with so many positive reviews I might give it another try. I brought it home from the library and listened to it with my nearly 3-year-old daughter. No go. This is just not our thing. My daughter stood up and walked out of the room (very abnormal reaction). And I, for one, simply can't stand the sound of it. I'm no music analyst, but it just seems a little too precious... and flat. Just thought I'd voice a differing opinion. Give it a listen. This cd may not be for you too."
3,okay,this is okay but it is only pellets and no colorful pieces that my guinea pigs love...I couldn't tell that when I ordered it. great price and I would buy it again.
2,Sticking to fruits & Veggies,our guinea pig poops like crazy after she eats this stuff. she doesnt like it more than carrots or apples. we're going to give it to her once a week. it runs right through her. we wont b buying this again
2,Not what it's cracked up to be....,"The plots are OK, but it is not the laugh-romp promised by the cover blurbs. I know it never is, but there was very little comedy about this. It had its moments, but Thraxas will never take a permanent place in the halls of fantasy."
5,A good accademic yet accessible work,"Marija writes as an archaeologist must, to present the data with a minimal personal viewpoint, yet the facts and artifacts she present speak for themselves and the lively, strangely gentle, culture of 'old Europe' is reviewed in this seminal work. Redefining our history and culture - reminding ourselves that humans once lived in a way hat was very if feint host hitch we tke for grated today . Astounding, thought provoking and beautiful. Recommended."
4,I love her CD 'Believe'!,CHER ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love her CD 'Believe'! I think she is a natural superstar!
2,i think it was good but it died down at the end.,hi cher how did you think of this c.d? my dad is a really big fan of yours and he wants to know if he can have a sighned photo of you
3,Believe Remixed,"Cher made a huge comeback in 1998 with her dance hit Believe, which soon became a club anthem with these remixes. This is the cd single, with 10 tracks, 9 of which are remixes. The remixes are done by Club 69, Peter Rauhofer, Phat N Phunky, Brian Higgins and Matt Gray, Marytn Norris, Jon Dixon, Wayne G and Andy Alder and more. The remixes are nice but really some sound quite alike, although I really did like the dub. Nice single to have if you like this song and want to hear its remixes, and by the way 3 stars is considered good."
4,HYPNOTIC!!!!!!,"Man, This song is totally HYPNOTIC. Who would have thought that Cher had it in her to come by or create such a cool song. I cant get over the vocal and electric keyboard work. I play it over and over...and Im not even really a Cher fan.."
1,Unbelievably AWFUL!,"My old Rubbermaid paper towel holder cracked and broke after 20 years, so I bought this as a replacement. What a nightmare! I made my husband take it down after 5 times of reaching to tear a paper towel and having the entire roll come down with it. Two ridiculous side clips retract and release the roll of paper towels when you try to tear at an angle with one hand. This gets a DO NOT BUY warning from me! What was Rubbermaid thinking????"
4,Kind of Dissapointed,This was a pretty good book but I have to say that it just lacked that extra passion that Knighton delivered so perfectly in Fulk The Reluctant now that was a good book. Now back to this book it was good had a pretty good story but it just wasn't passionate enough for me. It would have received five stars if there had been a bit more sex in the book but other than that it was okay.
5,great,this was nicely packaged without any items broken and is going to be a good gift for my mother in law.
5,Hottest CD,"I got this cd a little early (dont tell) and it is the hottest solo album from any of the bone thugs n harmony members. Im one of the biggest fans and I always buy two copies of all their cds one to listen to and the other goes in a collection display. But this is the hotest yet. If youre even remotely thinking about getting this cd, do so it is worth it.The best track is probably if i could go back also can be heard on the mo thugs III album the mothership. GET THIS CD!"
4,Charlie Rich 16 greatest hits,"I am not a big Country fan....but I love this man's voice. I remember when I was much younger hearing his songs, especially America The Beautiful and it stuck with me, it seems like forever. What a shame this man passed on without much hoopla. Truly a great American. Thanks Charlie."
2,Dinosaur Act,"If your intent is to study a comprehensive introduction to the theory of music - this is not the book you're looking for. Although it is adequately thorough, the book's explanations are poorly organized and consistently cluttered with unnecessary & outdated commentary. For example, the book goes so far as to chide electronic instruments as ""gloomy"" and ""hollow,"" insisting they have nothing to offer a serious musician. ABC of Music was published in 1963 and repeatedly shows its age. I've yet to see an adequate music theory companion, however, if you are strictly intent on being snooty about your compositions, Music Fundamentals: Through Pitch Structures and Rhythmic Design by Elvo S. D'Amante is worth the extra expense."
1,"Shame on you, Reiss and Catrow!","As a teacher of third graders, I've watched the increasingly crude humor in children's books with dismay. But it's time to say NO MORE!. This book is inappropriate for children or adults in it's use of ""adult"" humor. My job, educating respectful future leaders, is made so much more difficult as authors and illustrators profit by appealing to the ""lowest common denominator"" in society. David Catrow had been one of my favorite illustrators. No longer. Your purchase would be your vote of approval. As an educator, I ask that you make a statement by NOT PURCHASING this book."
5,Civil Exam,This booklet helped in studying the actual report that the meter maid has to fill out. Without this booklet I would have been lost in the exam
2,Dumb But Lucky writer,"This was not an easy read. The writer is so proud of his status as a maverick, that it invades the whole book, and makes one wonder why he wrote it at all. Compared to the Red Badge of Courage, or All Quiet on the Western Front, Saving Private Ryan, etc. it is an almost silly attempt to describe his experiences as a P51 pilot. He should have been court marshalled."
3,Dumb but lucky,"The author takes poetic license to it's extremes.Flowery descriptions of a pilot wakeing up in a tent are a little too much. Some of the technical facts are not facts, but there are quite a few interesting descriptions of mission events. I could also due without a few of the letters between him and his fiancee about faithful love, after they shacked up before he left the states. The title is accurate; I can't imagine the military letting anyone that dumb fly an airplane."
5,This is a MUST,"I am ipressed by the simple purity of these pieces.They do convince through their clyrity and beauty!No compromise to mainstraem taste, just pure lust of observing and pining down the essence of emotional excitment! wonderful!!"
2,Not terribly useful - Sorry,"I am new to photography and bought a couple of books to improve my skills and learn more about basic concepts, this one did no fit the bill for me. why?The first 64 pages are just a long intro to digital cameras talking even how to choose a camera, photons entering sensors and a lot of stuff that wasnt related to how to shoot better pictures.Pages 64-136 do talk about some concepts to improve your skillsThen the rest of the book is a semi-effort approach into how to digitally alter your images (crop, sharpening and same very fast photoshop examples).this book wasnt for me, didnt feel the flow and feel like in 300 pages there might be 50 that actually help an amateur photograpgher and"
3,Ok!,"I didn't really care for this book, but I am more of a hands on learner with a classroom. I like someone teaching me rather than reading about it."
2,Disappointed,"Where to start...let's begin with the included photographs of bad picture, good picture. For someone who claims to have an outstanding resume, most of these photographs are a joke. Lots of overexposed shots with poor composition. I was astounded. Next, he relies heavily on post-production techniques using Photoshop. While I understand the infatuation with Photoshop, how about we learn how to properly use lighting pre-production first? Also, in one book he attempts to take the reader from the very basic lighting concepts to the most advanced. This should not have been a Dummies book. I have a few others, and none attempts to appeal to all levels of users. Hence the name ""For Dummies."" Lastly, the author, who teaches photography at a university, is sadly not a writer. At all. I will be re-selling this book here and buying a different one."
3,Helpful for a beginner,As a new owner of a Cannon digital SLR camera I found this book was useful in getting started. My photos are definitely better after practising the tips in the book - I found the chapter on composition very helpful.
4,The Return of the Hog,"Another masterpiece in this series of bridge stories featuring all the great characters of the Griffin's Club, particularly, the Hideous Hog and the Rueful Rabbit. The stories are loaded with humorous situations and outcomes.Possibly the best was how the Griffin's became the only club in the world that restricts its membership to men only but is open to women. This in turn leads to the introduction of a great new character ""Molly the Mule"".Highly Recommended."
4,Extensive,"I couldn't believe the depths Ellmann takes the reader in his biography of Oscar Wilde. Everything; every aspect of Wilde's life is thoroughly explored. The best single word review of this book would be just that; thorough.On the other hand, the text is very dry at times, and you may find yourself frusterated. It always seems that, too often, biographies fall victim of the ""dry writer."""
1,Awkward fit,"While the hat looked adorable on the site, in reality it is way to large and awkward to fit a newborn or small baby. The knot and extra material at the top of the hat is too much. In addition, the cotton fabric is certainly not the softest. I gave the hat to my two other girls to use for their baby dolls instead."
1,Watson's CLassic Book on the Play of the HAnd at Bridge,"This is a wonderful reference book and I would have liked to refer to it many times. However, the book arrived in such an aged condition that it has already fallen apart and will soon be totally unusable."
1,Misled,I ordered this product and was told my order was received. Then I received a notice it was mailed to me followed a short while later that I was being refunded minus a short processing fee! If the product is NOT available--don't list it and send a notice it was mailed. I am NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.I only gave it one star because there was no place to recognize they are not worth receiving zilch stars.
5,I'm Loving it!,"I just finished eating this and not only was it super easy,fast to make, gave me a coupon for next time, but it was DELICIOUS,DELICIOSO,DÉLICIEUX,SQUISITO, KÖSTLICH!"
5,This book changed my life,"I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend. I can honestly say that it changed my life. It has everything a woman could need know about running. It got me from the point of not being able to run 5 minutes to running my first 1/2 marathon (and certainly could have gotten me to a marathon if I had any desire to run one). It has fantastic nutritional advice, great training plans, and advice for every situation a woman runner could find herself in.The book is easy to read - I read it in a couple sittings the first time through, as thought it were a novel. The essays and stories are powerful and helpful. It is well edited and organized.If you are a beginning runner, or if you have been running for year and you are looking for a new running guide, this book will be a great purchase. A number of friends have purchased it on my recommendation and they all say that it was a fantastic purchase."
5,Has it all!,"The book title says it all and it delivers the goods.Tons of useful information for new and somewhat experienced runners.I'm a somewhat experienced runner and gotten great insight into injuries, training, nutrition (race versus run), etc."
5,I love it!,"Truly comprehensive, covering all topics. I especially enjoyed reading the sections on weight loss and body image, and PMS. The author has so many good tips. I loved, loved, loved this book. It's worth buying for the extra motivation, and it really helps educate you as a female runner."
5,My Running Bible!,"This book is EXCELLENT, I think I have read it cover to cover probably at least 3 times. It covers EVERYTHING you need to know about running, including nutrition, training, weight concerns, motivation, racing, and special women concerns such as pregnancy and menopause. I ran only a one short race when I recieved this book as a gift, and as I read it I became SO inspired that I decided to do a marathon! Through all my training, I think I referenced back to this book at least every other day, and the answer I was looking for was always there. Never in my life did I think I would EVER run 26 miles, but now thanks to this book and becoming so inspired, I can proudly say for the rest of my life ""Once when I was 24 years old, I ran a marathon . . . """
3,The Facts,"I can not believe this product ever sold for the ""original price"" of $160 dollars!!It is worth the $39.95 it is ""on sale"" for.It is very attractive and seemingly well made. However, be aware of the following.* it is not all silk but a polyester silk combination* The filling is stated to be at least 75% down, leaving 25% of ?* There is not much down in the comforter. It is more of a spring or fall comforter. Certainly, not a winter comforter for anyone in the northern states."
2,One of the odd releases from Japan,"Copyright must have run out on everything the Ventures ever recorded in the Land of the Rising Sun. This release, one of a veritable flood issuing from their many days that island nation recently, is not really tuned for Western ears. At least there is not a drum machine everywhere. Suggest listening carefully to the samples of this and the others of this ilk, I may yet buy another disk of their 90's generation. Beware if no samples!"
4,Excellent!!,"I have allways liked all projects that Snowy Shaw has been inwolved in. But this beats them all... This is hard, scary, Transylvanian metal.Mix Dummu Borgir, The Project Hate, Cradle of Filth and King Diamond and you have it. Outstanding druming as usuall by Snowy...Also buy 'Illwill'!!"
4,Great Product for a Low Price,I needed a radio/IPOD player for the patio. This product was perfect. It can run on batteries or be used with an AC adaptor. Great quality sound for such a low price. The remote is a nice feature.
4,Forget the wife - who are the Riders?,"Forget what happens to the wife. What I want to know is, who are the riders?Scully seems like an ordinary guy, but then how many ordinary guys do you know who keep getting visits from mysterious black-cloaked horsemen who just stand around and then ride off into the night?This novel kept me guessing and guessing, and I'm still perplexed a year after I read it. By the end I felt for Scully and his daughter almost as though they were my own family. But as to what's going on, I've still no clue. Oh...I see...maybe that's the point."
4,Does what it does,"Straight forward install, looks good, all parts necessary are here. Mine came a little bit bent, so it's a bit wonky, but not bad enough that no one notices until i point it out (like a dummy)."
4,Security a must,it was strong; easy to install; and matched the finish of the door so it worked great.Could have been a little thicker metal for added security but O.K.
5,Bill Clinton...The AntiChrist,"The one word I would use to describe this movie is simple...""Disturbing""...and very eerie considering I grew up in Arkansas and I remember most of these murders when they happened. I have talked with people from Mena, Arkansas and they've all said that anyone that went near that air field were shot. The countless people that were shot in the back multiple times, but yet their deaths were ruled suicides. The many people that merely raised questions and whose lifes have never been the same. You need to see this movie if for nothing else...morbid curiousity. This movie is no different than ""Farenheit 9/11"", but with murders, sex, and cover-ups."
3,Lots of pretty pictures. Not much advice.,"If you're a fan of the show, you'll probably love this book. It has lots of large colorful pictures and nice bios of the stars. (Did you know Shannon Freeman is Donna Freeman's daughter? I didn't.)The Pros:* Lots of pretty pictures.* A quick read.* Bios of the Designed to Sell Team* Lots of pretty pictures.The Cons:* Not much in the way of ideas of techniques.* Too many pretty pictures.The bulk of this book is a recap of various shows they've done. Unless your house is similar to one of their shows, you won't find much.Personally, I found ""Buying for Profit"" from the folks at Property Ladder to be chock full of useful ideas for updating your home and preparing a property for sale."
3,Not Quite What I Expected,"Perhaps the subtitle of the book could have been ""Collecting Fabrics From Around the World"", or ""Try Your Hand at Textile Design"". I was looking for more history, pictures of the textiles,and examples of integrating indiginous cloth into decor, rather than craft and sewing how-to's. For my needs, it was a bit too eclectic."
4,Important defence of a maligned epoch,"The manuscript of this book had to be smuggled out of China, where the reactionary government suppressed its publication. Today's Chinese ""Communist"" Party viciously slanders the achievements of collective agriculture in the community Dazhai and the visionary leader Chen Yonggui who helped to make it a success. Yet thousands of people, both Chinese and foreign, saw for themselves the development of this once backward village into a thriving, highly productive agricultural community. It prospered until the early 1980s, when it was forcibly disbanded by the central government. The effects of decollectivisation were dramatic and criminal: in 1987, Dazhai, formerly a prosperous collective, was not able to feed itself.Qin Huailu is to be applauded for having the courage to record this important period of history in the face of oppression by the current counterrevolutionary régime. The accomplishments of Chen Yonggui and Dazhai will not be forgotten."
5,WOW!,"This is an AMAZING book. I couldn't put it down. I laughed, I cried, and I learned about a very special man. You can't go wrong with this book!"
3,All About Fergie,"When an artist sings so much about themselves, it just doesn't always make a good song. For Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas, she is somebody who has tried to make a staple of herself, as a new solo effort with attitude. Although she had a upbeat single before with London Bridge, her second single, Fergaclicious, is about how men think of her as a sex symbol, and what she thinks about it. The song isn't bad, as she adds some element of her group with Will.I.Am joining in the song, but it isn't too much like her own. I just hope that her next single tries to be better than this one.Song: C+"
1,Faulty,"I received one of these and it was faulty. The image on the screen cut in and out and had ""static"" on it. Amazon is accepting the return. Unfortunately, there is no replacement (only a refund) with this item. So, it looks like I'll be trying a different HDMI cable next time."
4,Good Starter,This is a great book to get the reader started into the Public Choice branch of economics and politics. It is a must read for people looking to jump into the much more complicated books on public choice.
1,Very dissapointing product,"When researching new clients, we used to work with the 1998 version. It allowed the sorting of potential clients but it also permitted the printing of labels to send promotional material. This new version limits the ability to export the data or print labels. Also, it will not allow you to purchase only the segment of the country you use most often. Furthermore, their service, technical support and sales team is horrendous. They are so busy selling you labels for 8 cents a piece that forget to customize the service to the clien't needs. Not worth for small businesses who want to target customers other than by phone."
1,I'm skipping this purchase,"I used to love ProCD products, but since InfoUSA bought ProCD the pricing and quality of the products are awful. I really hope another company emerges to compete with InfoUSA."
5,An awesome mystery,This story was a really suspenseful book. Nancy Drew recieves a letter from England about a large sum of money. She relizes that there must be another Nancy Drew. She starts looking for this other Nancy Drew and find out that a man is engaged to merry her and then take her money. Will Nancy find this mysterious Nancy Drew? Will she be able to stop the wedding? All of these questions will be answered in this book.
5,"Wonderful Gift for Girls, ages 8-11","My cousin's daughter just celebrated her 9th birthday, and I plan on giving her this book, along with some other Nancy Drew books, for Christmas. I gave her volumes 1 through 6 for her birthday, and her mom tells me that she is just blazing through each book, because she loves them so much.It warmed my heart to give her these books, as I remember reading them when I was her age. I used to borrow one book a week from the local public library in the 1970s. Nancy Drew was always a great read.I think that we establish a great connection with our children when we share with them something that we also loved as kids. It's a joy for all involved.In my opinion, you can't go wrong. These books are classics, and by encouraging young ones to read them, you help the children in your life to foster a great habit of reading--one that remains with them through their entire life. I think books of this nature also help to make them better critical thinkers and better writers."
3,Very good but not exactly luxury,"The sheets were soft to begin with when first added to the bed but after a few washings they started pilling. Would definitely recommend them for a guest room, and the color was a lot lighter than shown in the picture. Overall they are OK sheets."
2,If you want to sleep on gauze...,"These sheets are very thin. I haven't even slept on them yet, because... I'm not looking forward to it. I washed them twice hoping to soften them and inspire myself to put them on the bed... but so far it's not working. I'm bummed."
1,very disappointing!,"I washed these sheets before placing them on my bed, and they came out of the dryer looking like a wrinkled mess! And the texture was even worse! They feel very rough. My 200 thread count sheets are smoother and nicer than these. Save your $$ for something better."
1,Safah Collection Prima Cotton King Sheet Set,"These sheets are great, very comfortable and the price you can not bet.They fit my oversize mattress great,no pulling up from the sides or the ends of the mattress.I also purchased the regular size sheets in this brand and they are super.You feel like you are sleeping on silk."
2,Wtong Size,"The ""King"" size sheet set contained 1 king top sheet, 2 king pillowcases, and 1 FULL size fitted sheet. Made in Pakistan."
5,never goes to waste,"My husband and I enjoy these cakes very much. If I make an entire cake mix or batch of cupcakes it never fails that 1/4 of it goes to waste since it is just the 2 of us. My husband was watching Ace of Cakes one night and then wanted cake, so I made one of these and in about a minute we were sharing the cake...no waste! I pick them up on sale and keep a couple in the pantry. The lemon cake is excellent too."
2,Just a Powerpoint on DVD,The presentation was a PowerPoint probably used on one of his Webinars. I am planning on trying to watch it again but it was very hard to sit through the first time. After I watch it again I can make a better decision on whether it is informative or not.
2,"Lies, Damn Lies, and Homespun Tab","Unlike some of the other reviews on here, I found the long section on getting proper tone and positioning very useful. I can see how this wouldn't be appropriate for a beginning guitarist, though.But when Homespun tells you ""includes tab,"" what they really mean is ""here's a tiny booklet with some licks, but none of the four included songs are tabbed.""When I phoned Homespun to ask where the alleged tab was for the four songs included, a very nice lady was sad to tell me that they don't exist. When asked how a buyer is supposed to know which of their DVDs that say ""include tab"" actually *don't*, she was at a loss.I really want to support companies like Homespun, I know they struggle against P2P piracy. But they're flat-out lying to customers about what's included when you do the right thing and buy instead of torrent. They certainly won't get any more business from me unless I've checked it out beforehand via alternate methodology."
2,Difficult...,"an obviously talented musician, I am not sure I can say that he is a talented teacher. I own all 3 volumes and really struggle with the tempo. As another reviewer said, the tab is not precise, and Bob moves very quickly through the material. An advanced intermediate guitarist would likely benefit the most.One thing that did catch me off guard was when he began to sing. At first, I thought he was just being funny, and imitating an ""old African-American"" sound and style of singing; like a parody. I was not correct in this; apparently, this was not meant to be humorous.Most everything from Homespun is gold. They seem to choose talented artists who are also gifted teachers. I am not sure that this DVD fits that bill. Bob is an incredible guitarist, but for an instructional DVD, a talent for communicating that skill, like so many others on Homespun, is essential."
2,dissonant...,"I am going to sound a different bell than the other reviewers here: while they rave about this album, I have to say I was rather annoyed. To me, Monk did not integrate with Blakey's band. They are playing in a quite straight up style, and he is in a very broken motifs mood. His style is very percussive here (short abrupt chords, with little continuity) and keeps running against the music the others weave around him. It sounded to me like a kid sabotaging the music. He is silent on the head out of 'evidence', or on the drums solo: those are the best parts.(and don't get me wrong: I love Monk, he's a genius and one of the greatest composers, it just did not fit here)."
1,Dud,This battery worked for 1 WEEK then just gave out. Nothing different was done and I've checked the camera with another battery. No explanation.
1,wrong brand,Your picture shows Nikon brand. The one I received is a Targus brand.I charged once and already is peeling off the black cover.This is not what I paid for.Please send me the original Nikon brand shown in this picture.Thanks.
2,Disappointed,I have purchased two E2c earphones and each time received the covers which were soft and comfortable. These are hard and do not have the same flexibility and comfort in the ear. The do not provide the same noise canceling effect because they do not expand like the softer ones do.
3,"Great item, must have, why they don't sell replacements in stores is beyond me","I have never seen this product in any big box retailer, I don't know why. You must have these if you are going to use this type of headphone. Quality is exactly like the ones that come with the original headphones."
2,Pretty weak,There are only a couple of good songs on here. I don't have this and I'm glad I don't. Don't buy this
2,It's Alright,"I thought this was going to be larger than it is, however, it's cute. I purchased it for my granddaughter and I guess I didn't read the age it was considered appropriate for. One of those things that won't get played it"
2,Disappointing singing in beautiful production,"This Manon looks beautiful and I enjoyed watching the great costumes and scenery, but I was very disappointed with the singers. Marcelo Alvarez has good high notes but this does not seem to be a good role for him. Renee Fleming sings beautifully in places, but her vocal mannerisms are very apparent, there are slurps, swooning, and very fussy delivery. Also, she does not look convincing as a young girl in the first act, and looks very frumpy in the Adieu aria. Her acting is servicable, she seems to be relying on her glamour instead, but I admit I was more impressed by her gowns than her performance. Hopefully there will be a new DVD of Manon, possibly with Vargas and one of the French sopranos like Dessay."
2,These are leather,"The shoe might be a very good shoe, but if you are looking for something non-leather, this shoe is not that. The description makes it sound like it is non-leather, but that is misleading. For some this is a selling point, but as a vegetarian, it is not."
1,Listen before you leap,I was in Paris when i first heard Giovanni.My heart leapt off the Leaning Tower and smashed into the ground. The music was so dull and lifeless and could not hold up my spirt.
5,Perfect,This is the 1M tip that makes the classic cupcake frosting. The picture is a little weird but this is what you are looking for.
3,Bigger is better,"It's a little better than your standard Laser or Optical mouse pad. But what is great about it is the size. Bigger is better, I have not scrolled off the pad yet in any game play, as I have in the past on my standard laser pad.Is it worth 12 plus bucks?If you're looking for pad for your high end laser or optical mouse that will give some running room.Then it is well wroth it."
5,a book for Narnia lovers' younger siblings!,"Eric, Greg and Sara's dramatic entrance into the Avalon is somehow more romantic and believable than C.S. Lewis's wardrobe, yet it is of the same genre of literature. Huon of the Horn and his winged horses draw Eric, Greg and Sara in further, and the reader with them! Steel Magic would be classified as an ""intermediate"" novel, which is between easy reader and young adult. The three children rely on books that Eric and Greg have read for some of their insight into the strange world of Avalon, which incites in Sara the desire to read the tales of King Arthur and Merlin. Avalon has a cherished place in literature; your 3rd through 6th grader will find Steel Magic an enchanting introduction to this world!"
5,Superior puppy pads!,Far superior to the kind you find in the pet store at half the price. Just be careful to keep them right side up.
5,good product,"I have 4 chihuahuas. Puppies refuse to go outside in the wet or cold, which it has been for months. Pads do the job, quilting locks in the wet."
5,Excellent,"Excellent product. I will recommend this product to anybody. I have been using this same product for years, and my dog likes it."
2,not as absorbent as they used to be,I have been using these pads for my mini dachshund since she was a puppy.We live in a condo and she uses the pads for all of her bathroom needs.I have been purchasing the grid lock brand for a year or more and was very happy with their absorbency. However the last two boxes have caused problems of leaking and having to be changed very frequently. I am in the process of looking for a puppy pad that will better meet our needs.
4,Puppy Training Pads,"The Gridlock Puppy Training Pads are very thick and absorbent. They do not have a deodorizer in them to counteract the smell like some other doggy pads do, but they definitely work."
5,Great Product,"If you are looking for a pad that dosen't leak, this is it! This is a much better pad than the one that my pet supply store carries."
3,Ok product,"These wee wee pads were great price wise and not as bulky as the ones that I normally buy which made them great for storage. However, one or two ""pees"" and the pad is somewhat done as any liquid spreads far and wide. As ok as these pads are, I will be returning to my expensive Drs Foster & Smith the next time around."
4,Good Grammy CD,"This 1999 Grammy album is probably my next favorite, because of just 2 songs on in which thank God were back-to-back of the tracking of the CD. ""Ray OF Light"" by Madonna which also has a great video, and ""You're Still The One"" by Shania Twain were the best songs on this CD, of course when you add a Madonna song to any album it gets so much better, just look at the 2001 grammy album, but there are other winners here, ""Wide Open Spaces""(Dixie Chicks), and ""Everybody""(BackStreet Boys), also ""The Boy Is Mine""(Brandy/Monica), but there are others that should not be on here example ""LuLlaby""(Shawn Mullins)"" which is not even to me a song, all it is, is a poem he doesn't even sing in it not to mention it is one of the most nauseaing songs ever. Another is ""Save Tonight""(Eagle Eye One Hit Wonder Cherry"") another annoying song, doesn't it seem like the radio plays the most annoying song too much like the last two mentioned, anyway besides those two duds the CD is a winner."
2,NUTHING NEW HERE,Its been a long time between recordings for this great lady...but for me Im sorry to say her music has not moved forward at all...there are a couple of great moments but as for the rest the voice sounds great but the songs are very forgettable....such a shame because when shes hot the voice is full of fire.Better songs and prodution would have resulted in the must have cd of the year and the most anticipated release of the year but alas I doubt that this one will do it for Anita...nice to have for the fact that its her but as for the repeat button I dont think u will be pushing it.
3,Why is this beautiful cd so short and predictable !,"I really wasn't expecting to like Anita's new cd butthis one really shows she's back in fine form vocallyand the songs are very good. However, typical of herpast efforts, it's quite trunticated. I've read whereAnita is a perfectionist in the studio and I guess that'swhy. When quality control is a top concern, sometimescreativity and spontaniety become somewhat constricted.So much time is spent on polishing what little youcreated, there is almost no time to move forward and getmore ideas added to the plate. As usual everything alwayssounds so meticulous in her material. You almost wish thenext time Anita would find a variety of different producersand musicians to work with to bring out some different sidesto her musical personality besides what she's already givenus time and time again."
2,Dated material,"What a let down this album is. It took 10 years for another great singer to release a new album. An album filled with painfully dated material. Anita does what she does best with her heavy but sultry singing. But the problem here is that she has been stuck in a time capsule since 1994. It's as almost as if nothing has inspired her over the past decade to try something different or experimental for the 21st century. Not that she's required to do so. But sometimes, the best quality of an artist is his or her ability to grow and change into different aspects of thier sound and style. Here, Anita just doesn't do this.Honestly, if you want to hear this new album from Anita, your better off saving your money and just rotate what you already have in your Anita collection."
3,Same Ol Love...but why did it take a DECADE to arrive?!,"I own all of Anita Baker's CDs and bought this one the day it came out without evening hearing it first - like SADE and LUTHER and other singers that have their own instantly memorable ""signature"" sound, this is pure Anita Baker all the way - that's good...and bad. While these songs are surely listenable and pleasant in Anita's patented quiet-storm style, one wonders why it took TEN YEARS for this? The title track (and its jazzy scat reprise!), the Babyface duet, and a few others are strong and earn repeated listens, but much of this is below Anita's high standards such as Sweet Love, Angel, Giving You the Best, Been So Long, etc. But I am glad to know that a singer with as much talent, style, and grace as Anita Baker can take off a decade and then release a new CD that tops the charts - good to know there is still a sizeable audience for QUALITY MUSIC instead of thw empty, throwaway padlum that passes for Top 40 pop music today."
1,Bitterly Disappointed,"I've read the first four in Feintuch's excellent Seafort saga and loved them all. Then I got this one and was bored to tears. It's very different to other's true but the formula of the rest of the series was fine with me.What you basically have is a dull, story full of teenage kids you do not care about, the world is badly described, the story just poor. I put the book down after 100 pages, maybe it gets better but frankly I don't care.Get back to space Feintuch."
3,Lost it's head,"This helmet does its job. After 6 years it's still in the family. The top case plastic did come off, but a little black electrical tape and it's all good."
3,only plays 3inch dvd or cds. Not the standard size dvds.,"Make sure you know this is only to play the 3 inch ""mini"" dvd.Might be good if you have those minidvd camcorder. that's all i can see the use of this thing. also note you'll be paying shipping on ""13"" pounds, althought the line above the weight clearly states this is 1.4 pounds. how lame is that? Unit feels very flimsy."
1,Save your money!,"If you notice the date from the sellers who wrote these revies, they are at least 2 years old. I have ordered at least four of these 'supposed' portable mini dvd players(I say 'supposed' because not one of them has arrived), over the past year and a half, and have yet to recieve one. This is the biggest scam online I have ever seen, if you have the opportunity to buy one of these players do not buy them on amazon. And definetly do not buy from the seller, 'book1998', or 'J&R music and computer world'. As it states in the title of the review, 'SAVE YOUR MONEY!'"
1,Underlining does not help,"I have never read any kind of book that the author felt it necessary to underline words to get her point across. It was so aggravating that I found myself skipping pages to get away from it. Half way through, I threw it out. It started out pretty good and then turned into hodge podge."
5,Actually very good,"I thought I had lost my faith in 20th century writing, but this novel proved just how well a feminist can write. The book isn't even preachy, in fact, it reminds me of a story by Charlotte Gilman Perkins called ""The Yellow Wallpaper"". It's almost like both characters are literally being eaten, or consumed, by male driven society. Rich in metaphors, the novel illustrates how women can regain control of their lives, not necessarily through the bounds of matrimony, but through the rejection of it. Marian does not seem to have a life her own, but follows paths shaped by other's expectations of her as a woman. I really enjoyed the end of the book, it seemed fitting and makes the book a whole metaphor for the moral crisis that Marian goes through, particularly when her mind is rebelling from the society that influences her daily life. In other words, read this book."
3,Pretty Tasty Tidbit,"Most people would agree that Margaret Atwood's later work is much stronger than her earlier, but this book may be an exception. Though not a standout like ""Alias Grace"" or ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" ""The Edible Woman"" is engaging storytelling.The characters are interesting and the story is engrossing. The tension, discontent, and yearning is almost palatable. A good read!"
3,Reading with Tequila,"The Edible Woman was full of deep, meaningful thoughts. It was quite obvious that more was going on than just what was written on the page. Unfortunately, I couldn't quite figure out what the actual message was supposed to be. Women sabotage themselves? They relinquish control to men? They need to fix people? They judge each other? Food issues are a sign of insecurity? Even food has feelings? Something else entirely? I couldn't grasp the point.The story itself was decent, but not very compelling. It took me a long while to finish the book because it was such dry reading. I usually thoroughly enjoy Margaret Atwood's books, but this early novel was not her best."
2,this ain't working,I like His Previous Hits Collection far better.this is way too middle of the road&runs out of gas before it even starts up.Bob Seger has had a decent run but you can't drop a Hits Package with so many lesser known Hits or cuts that are barely worth hearing twice&that is a reach with most of the tracks here.
3,B Seger Rides Again,"Some great songs (Her Strut/Rock & Roll Never Forgets) some lame fillers. Seger's stuff is not on iTunes, so not being able to buy individual songs forces you to buy whole CD's-a strategy that maximizes Bob's net worth-not yours."
5,Has been helpful for my allergies,"Honeywell HFD-130 Germicidal Tower Air Purifier with Permanent IFD FilterI bought this filter in 2006. Until July 2010 I ran it 24/7 most of the time. It has helped me sleep better without as much congestion/sneezing/coughing through the night. The filters are easy to clean and you don't have to keep buying filters which was a huge plus for me. I just wish the base was easier to clean. I attracts dust bunnies that are difficult to vacuum out because of the grills around the bottom.I still use it overnight when I'm sleeping during bad allergy days. However, upon purchasing a new HVAC system for the house I found I didn't need the Honeywell as much. Some days I don't use it at all but that is testimony to the new system and not a problem of the Honeywell."
3,"First Impressions (big, simple and smelly)","Bought this unit for 2 reasons.1. it was priced below $80 and that was in my budget2. it was a ""tower"" style and i was looking for something that would not take up too much floor space.Here is what i think after it arrived:It was bigger than i thought... I was expecting something about the size of a cd tower and this was wider and deeper than i thought. Its not huge, but it's not tiny.There were many comments about noise. The unit runs a fan on the inside, so there is the constant whoooshh of a fan... low is easily ignored...Hope it cleans the air..."
5,WORKS!,"Strongly Recomend for smokers and multiple pet owners....I bought this at Home Depot last year- ALOT Cheaper- Less than half this price!!.....with 5 litter boxes within range (the UV really helps here) and 2 smokers this machine has been tremendous! I have it on an old end table with a crystal wind chime hanging right over it that used to get Cruddy in no time, now it is beautiful as it should be....I do highly reccomend placing a piece of paper or whatever under it as it will leave a Dirty outline around it (will clean off most surfaces -even this old mahogany one)....it is also fairly easy to clean"
5,Good addition to the coin book library,"This book is well organized with 160 monochrome pictures (taken by the author) with physical descriptions and historical background. One major plus is that this book is that even though they are included it does not concentrate on Greek and U.S. coins.Contents:* How coinage Began* Greek Coins* Roman and Byzantine coins* English Coins 1. Ancient Britain to Charles II* English Coins 2. Charles II to Elizabeth II* Britain's Modern Coinage* Error, Freaks and Forgeries* Condition, Rarity and Value* Coins and Metal Detecting* What shall I Collect?* Looking After Your CollectionEmphasis is that if you have a bunch of coins but no plan, that it is an ""accumulation"" and not a ""collection."""
2,Little old fashioned...,"...so if you thought that what's written in the book is what that scoliosis girls have to go throught now- luckily, you're wrong.This book is nice, but I didn't really like it. First, Deenie is overreacting to her Brace (To cut off all your hair? pliz...). Second, none of the characters looks realistic- I found them mostly annoying. I didn't like the writing of the book, which made me so...bored.I don't really recomand this book, but the subject is important- there're a lot of scoliosis girls, and there's allmost no book about it."
3,one of Blume's better books,"The relationships between Deenie and her mother, father, and sister are very well thought-out. I admit I was scandalized when I first read this book in seventh grade at the makeout scene between Deenie and Buddy, but it certainly didn't encourage me to go out and do that myself, and as for masturbation, Blume is VERY VAGUE and merely wishes to point out that this is normal, which it is, as any two-year-old could tell you if two-year-olds could talk well enough. People who want this book banned on a couple of minor details are missing the whole point of the book, which is about a teenager who is trying to do the right thing amidst a whole lot of physical and emotional barriers. A good read."
5,Excellent book that is very accurat,"When I first found out I had scoliosis one of the first things my mother did was give me a copy of this book. The book Deenie is about a thirteen year old girl who was thinking about becoming a model when she learns that she, beautiful Deenie has scoliosis. Judy Blume so accuratly described the feelings and emotions of Deenie that it felt as though she was writing about me. Untill I had read this book I felt as if I was the only one going through this even though doctors had told me there were other girls my age with scoliosis. This was such an excellent book that the only time I could put it down was to wipe the tears from my eyes. This is the perfect book for any girl especially one who has scoliosis."
3,Not Bad for the Price.,"This is the cheap ligature you by the student who doesn't know if they even like the saxophone. It is an improvement over most factory ligatures, but not recommended for intermediate or advanced players. It succeeds in darkening the tone for beginners, but sounds muffled compared to lighter ligatures like the Charles Bay. Good for beginners but not the serious player."
2,Le Nozze di Figaro,"Contrary to Mr Cotton's review of this DVD, I wonder how anyone could NOT notice this this production is in black and white...Perhaps those who are color blind? Note well: this recording is in mono not stero...again a noticeable difference. Although performances are fine I reget purchasing this for my collection. However, if you are deaf and color-blind I urge you to purchase this recording."
3,"3 pretty good Christmas tales, 2 poor.....","I totally agree with Scibarfans review-the first two stories by Allison Lane and Barbara Metzger were very good, I'd give each about 4 stars, but the last three stories quickly go down hill.Surprisingly, even Carla Kelly's-whom I normally enjoy. Her story was OK-though nothing special to endear it to the reader.The last two stories by Elizabeth Fairchild and Edith Layton were unreadable, in my opinion. In fact, I'm quickly finding that Layton and Fairchild are going on my ""do not read"" list as they just don't do it for me.Of the five stories, like Scibarfan, I enjoyed Barbara Metzgers the best but not enough to recommend this Anthology just for that one story. If you must read this, I'd suggest you get it very cheaply.2.5 stars."
4,The history of 20th Century Music goes to the funhouse,"Few artists are motivated or well-equipped to interpret the entire scope of 20th century music in the course of one album. Thank heavens for the unfettered spirit of Lester Bowie and his posse, Brass Fantasy. The Spice Girls' tune ""Two Become One"" is given an utterly captivating reading here. This one song is reason enough to buy this album. Bowie and company also navigate Puccini's aria ""Nessun Dorma"" (in a Nawlins street-carnival spirit), late rapper Notorious B.I.G.'s ""Notorious Thugs"" (complete with vocals by Dean Bowman) and oldies radio staples ""If You Don't Know Me By Now"" and ""In The Still of the Night"". Little brother Joseph Bowie guest-raps on ""Next"" and trombonist Josh Roseman shows true potential to become a jazz star of the next decade. The one downer is a bizarre rendition of Marilyn Manson's ""Beautiful People"" which I still can't bear all the way through. Otherwise Bowie's latest parade of pop music re-assemblages is a keeper."
1,You can't get in trouble over a book?,"!!!March 9, 2006 Rubin's company was charged, and since has settled the charges, that it made deceptive advertising claims about its products: http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2006/03/gardenoflife.htmHaving worked in a health food store for years, I've seen Rubin's skinny bearded photo in many Garden of Life advertisements. The ad claims the supplement cured him of Crohn's Disease. I almost hit the floor when I was channel surfing and saw his picture on the tube. I watched in astonishment as he claimed to be riddled with diseases that apparently went beyond his Garden of Life sell-out cure. Whatever he's claiming, it sounds fishy. The book is on reserve at the library (I'm 37 of 38 requests - that infomercial must be working!) and I can't wait to see what he's up to. The circumstances just don't ring true. Since his run-in with the FTC, maybe he's going into the fiction business?"
3,Rose Petal Sink,"My daughter got the Rose Petal Cottae from Santa...her aunt knew what he was bringing, so she got her the sink to go with it. Later I found the washing machine on clearance at Target. Of the three appliances she now has (stove came with the cottage) this is the one she plays with the least. The other two have doors to open and put things in, she likes that very much. She doesn't get into the pretend washing hands...she'd much rather do it with real water. Maybe when she gets older. I bet she'd love a dishwasher though since she's always helping me put away the dishes."
1,What happened to the Recipe?,"I am so disappointed--Betty Crocker changed the recipe. This is not the product advertised. This new recipe can no longer be made with egg whites, and now it calls for the addition of butter! In the old recipe, I had finally found something I could indulge in without the added fat and cholesterol. The egg whites made it so light I could eat cake as a snack or as a dessert without feeling overly full. This recipe is very 'heavy'. I issued a complaint on [...]and was told that it was changed due to consumer poles (?). If anyone prefers the healthier recipe as I do, please contact them and let them know that Change is NOT ALWAYS GOOD! (Amazon, update your description!)"
2,Hype is the Downfall of Good Music,"While this album does have its high points, how can anyone in his or her right mind say it eclipses the last effort, Perfect From Now On, which, in my mind,would have receinved 5 stars. This recording deserves little more than two stars for selling out."
4,What a surprise!,"Had no idea about this band until they were recommended by a friend. ""Carry the Zero"" is one of the best pop tunes I've heard in a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG time. The album is a very surprising treat."
3,"Balanced Info, Pathetic Copyediting and Proofreading","Time is money. Money is everything. When a book about a hot book is rushed through the development process to hit the stores at the right time, slopiness prevails.I found the wealth of information balanced and interesting. But too many typos and even shredded, repeated lines do not lend credence to an overall book. Shabby editing and copyediting make one feel the research may be shabby too. That's why I've given it a ""C"" rating. It shot itself in the foot."
2,"Love Boynton, but not this book.","Boynton's books are generally bouncy, sing-song, silly books. My kids and I love them! This book is a short compilation of stories that seem to have a song to them that the reader doesn't understand. It would be better as a music cd/book set because the stories by themselves aren't that interesting, cute or funny. Wish I hadn't bought it. I recommend Boynton's ""Philadelphia Chickens"" music cd & book set over this book."
2,Not our favorite by Boynton,"We have a few of her books and my daughter really loves them so I thought a bedtime collection would be great. While the stories are short which is nice, a few of them are kind of boring and just odd. She wasn't a fan. We have maybe read the whole thing 2 times in the 2 years we've owned it."
5,1-year old likes them.,Should hold up to wear and tear through several kids. Wipe clean material. Set is small but easy to read.
2,Disappointing in some ways,"Although we have a history of liking Boynton books, this was not very interesting for my child, age 2.5. This book has seven bedtime stories set up on two pages each. Each page spread is one story, somewhere between 16 and 20 lines of text. That's it, not much of a story. The rhymes are cute, but in two of the stories the rhyme seems very forced. The pictures, as always, are great. But the ""stories"" are more like nursery rhymes, an alternative to Mother Goose.What do we like about it? The tab system that lets my child count as we go through the book. She also recognized a couple of characters from the Going to Bed Book, which I think is a better bedtime Boynton book, in the pajamas page.I think if you've been reading more substantial story books, like Seuss or Sendak, or other classics, this is probably too elementary, unless you are still doing short books at night. Based on the reviews, I thought this was a sure hit; but I didn't realize what the actual content would be."
5,My benchmark for a great toddler book,"This was the first book my busy toddler really loved. Now she's 4 and can read it herself, and she still loves it. And what's more, I'm not even tired of it! The humor, the rhymes, and the dialogue that invites participation are all great. ""Meatier"" than the smaller Boynton board books, but still in just-right bite-sized chunks. In my opinion, the best Boynton's done (unless you count Rhinoceros Tap, which play to a somewhat older audience but is also a huge winner)."
5,Snoozers,"My little 3 year old loves this book. It gives him the option of picking which story he wants read for the evening - although, we do end up having to read the whole book. He loves the night sound story the best and makes the sounds himself and if I even try to do it with him, we end up starting over."
3,Wish there was more of a story,"I love Sandra Boynton books for my toddler. However the ""short"" stories are a page long. So you have 6 pages of of one liners. Not what I was expecting. I should have went with a Boynton classic board book instead like ""Pajama time."""
5,"Snoozy Choosers, Choose Snoozers","This book is awesome! 7 perfectly short (but super fun) bedtime stories that are tabbed for little fingers to turn the pages with ease. This is a favorite of Mom, Dad, And toddler!"
3,"Cute, but not what I expected","This is a very cute little book. Not sure if I would actually consider it a ""bedtime book"". Maybe my 20 month old granddaughter either is too old or too young for this book, but she doesn't care about the pictures in it and she NEVER asks for it to be read again, much less read at all! I pick it up to read to her, and she shakes her head and tells me ""NO"" ! If I open the pages, SHE closes them, and I have to choose a different book!. Maybe another 6 months to a year, she MIGHT enjoy it more. Also, I didn't realize there are ""tabs"" on the pages and she likes to chew on them and then bend or tear them."
2,Loved the show --- the CD is a letdown,"Seeing ""Hedwig"" in the theater was an incredibly exciting evening of entertainment. After listening to the CD, I now realize that the success of the show relied heavily on John Cameron Mitchell's brilliant, heart-stopping performance. (He, alas, left the show in early January). Missing, too, is Mr. Mitchell's text that's filled with humor and poignancy. The CD captures none of the magic, tragedy, or high-spitited lunacy that were so evident on stage. What's left are some mediocre rock songs that would lead one to believe that the show is an over-bearing, pretentious bore. It isn't ! See it if you can (even without Mr. Mitchell) !"
1,Do not buy any Pinnacle product!,"Nothing but problems, as some of the other reviews point out. Even after upgrades, still freezes and cannot burn DVDs. There is no customer ""service"", just words which are unhelpful. They want you to buy more. Just another corrupt greedy company..."
5,A Classic!,"Much music came after this album but this alone is the most distinctive in style and sound. It has stood the test of time and the ""background story"" contained in the liner is as enchanting as the music itself.A must for any serious reggae fan!"
4,"""THE ULTIMATE WEAPON!""","Apart from one of the cheesiest monsters ever invented(except Godzilla in Japan, of course!), this is a vast improvement on Revenge Of The Cybermen and has atmospheric aliens, brilliant dialogue, nice location shooting, great special effects and Geoffrey Holder's music rises high above Dudley Simpson's very un-spectacular music around that time that slowed some of Baker's adventures to a walking pace."
1,knowing stinks!,"packaging not sealed, dark color, smells old! stinks! Coworkers agree! Cannot use!!!! complained to merchant, sent another, not sealed, dark and stinks...sour and old"
5,Signature fragrance,"I wore Estee Lauder's ""White Linen"" for years until my daughter introduced me to ""Knowing"" while I was visiting her in California. It has become my ""signature fragrance"" and I expect it for my birthday and Christmas every year in some form. Whenever I am wearing it, someone ALWAYS comments on its fragrance and asks me what I am wearing. It is a light fragrance but also very distinctive. I doubt that I will ever stop wearing it."
2,"Alright for reference, but useless otherwise.","I found this book to be EXTREEMLY disjointed and outdated. Half the examples I tried both from the book and the CD would not compile. It is worthless as a tutorial, and almost so as a reference. I thought it was a rather cruel joke to put a compilor onto the CD which would not compile independant executables."
1,not really that helpful - incomplete.,This book is overpriced & lacks attention to detail. It has some good ideas on using C++ - but is not as generic as the author claims. The CD that comes with the book DOES NOT contain all the code the book claims and the web site/author cares little to forward any missing parts - no help at all - basically you pay for incomplete work...what a shame.
2,Compiling Dross,"The book, though appearing to be the ultimate guide, falls far short of really being both a learning tool or significant reference guide. A great deal of the examples listed did not compile, the compiler supplied was so limited in it's use that it was almost like an insult to include it. Couple these shortfalls with a bloated price tag, and a pretentious claim to being the only book one should buy to learn and program in C/C++ and you have this monstrosity which i must confess paid money for."
3,Good place to start but it could have been better,"I can't seem to escape Pete Yorn on MTV2. He's either talking with one of the VJ's or his video is playing. Plus he has been receiving loads of critical praise for ""Musicforthe morning after"". I finally broke down today and picked up his album when I actually sat through a showing of his video ""Life On a Chain"" (I think but I can't remember). His music is quite melodic and catchy BUT I honestly was left unimpressed. Pete is talented but his music is just something that didn't live up to all the hype that surrounds it. Just nothing too special I think."
4,mostly solid - a few weak numbers,"a solid and rocking album that reveals many influences while displaying a uniqueness all its own. I hesitate to give it a four instead of a five, but it is truly an enjoyable, shockingly well put together album for someone practically starting out.Some of the songs are ballads and others are powerfully uplifting rockers. Most of the songs are filled with thoughtfulness and commitment on the part of the artist. Others seem more half-hearted and amateurish: understandable for a newbie. He'll move forward quickly.I look forward to future output - and if the live performance is any indication - this guy's gonna be around for quite a while."
5,My Favourite Album,"Well, I picked this album up when it first came out, and I remember it was like 7.99 or some debut price. I invested in it, and kinda skimmed through the album and thought it was alright and moved on to other albums I'd bought. A few months later, I played it, and fell in love with it. Almost every song seemed to relate to things I had felt or was going through, and I began listening to the singles and loved them. Then, I began listening to each song individually and liking them each in their own way. Overall, this has grown to be my favourite album I've ever purchased. I've never grown sick of it, and have sooo overplayed it. He has another album coming out this year supposedly, so I am anxious for that... and for any fan or person who enjoys his music, I'd recommend sampling or purchasing the Spider Man soundtrack for the song ""Undercover"". Perfection!"
5,Yorn's New Americana,"Out of no where comes Mr. Yorn's roots pop. Bob Dylan, the Counting Crows, John Mellancamp, and the Eagles are heard in full effect. He takes accordions, acoustic and electric guitars, and a moody voice (that reminds me of the lead singer from Coldplay) and brews up a wonderful American musical concoction. There's solid riffs in ""For Nancy"" along with a sprinkling of a drum machine. ""Murray"" echoes classic Eagles with a great chorus. Yorn makes serious pop music that makes you feel what he felt in making it."
5,A brilliant rock masterpiece,"I bought this album several years ago, and just sent one to a friend. This is a wonderful album from start to finish- one of those where you never have to press the skip button on your CD player. Every song has its own unique character and melody, but somehow they all tie in together to tell a story. The musicianship is top-notch and there is no evidence of anything overtly electronic to ruin the mood of good old fashioned rock.I haven't bought his subsequent albums for fear that they just won't be as good as ""Music....""- how can they?"
5,You have to buy this wondeful album,"I had heard ""For nancy"" on the radio and MTV and decided to see what the rest of his music was all about. I downloaded some of the songs and liked them so much I went out and bought his album that day. ""Closet"" is a brilliant song as well as ""Just Another"" and ""Black"". This is a CD that i wil never get tired of and find myself singing songs from it throughout the day. If you are a fan of ""For Nancy"", that is just the tip of the iceburg as the rest of his album is a great listening experience as well."
1,Don't believe the hype.,"I have to write this, because I am literally shocked by the number or people supposedly taken in by this thoroughly mediocre singer/songwriter. The saccharine tones of the reviews so far lead me to believe that the people with discriminating taste in music have either not bothered to chime in, or hopefully, not heard the disc at all. First off, the people Yorn's been compared to above -- Elliot Smith, Alex Chilton, even Bruce Springsteen -- are leagues ahead of him. There is no passion whatsoever in the overly slick production of these atonal guitar ditties. Yet, if it weren't for the big money production, you'd have a tough time distinguishing this collection from untold thousands of one-dimensional open-mike sets from your average broken hearted kid at Coffeehouse USA. Thankfully, I didn't pay for this, but if you're into lame, lowest-common-denominator, corporate approved culture, you're welcome to buy my free promo copy for cheap."
5,Listen once and then again and again and again..............,"This collection of songs is truely awesome. It starts strong and ends strong. The funny thing is that the shape of each song is distinct and different enough to keep you listening again and again. The melodies and arrangements are clever but simple and the attention paid to the beginning and ending of each song makes you aware that the guy just knows how to create a good song. Cannot recommend it enough, get it and tell your friends, the guy deserves the credit. Cannot wait for the needle to go back to the beginning again and again..........."
1,"His brother, people...","I don't care much for this guy. This is overproduced, bland pop that sounded old in 1994. If you want the Lemonheads' sound, just go buy a Lemonheads CD - it's that simple. Don't waste your time with this thing.Basically I just want to add to what an earlier negative review had to say: The reason Pete Yorn is getting pushed so hard is because he's connected. His brother is one of the most powerful agents in Hollywood. Now there's nothing wrong with that. You can't fault either of them for being related! But I really feel like his show-biz connection is the only reason Yorn is getting such hype. It kills me to think that talented, original artists are being passed over due to plain old radio-friendly nepotism. This is a wholly unremarkable CD. Check out Jeff Buckley instead - real talent and real music recorded without the assistance of a PR juggernaut."
3,The Horrors,"I like tha concept of the pit and thats why I brought it. It's something different in horror shows and these creepy little things should be looked after better, and fed more with your enemies.Can't spoil the story line and must keep people guessing."
4,"""One Mint Julep"" has been in my head for 14 years!!!","My parents had this cassette that they played all the time when I was a little tyke. Just for kicks I tried to find it with Amazon.com because bits and pieces still would pop into my head every once in a while. Sure enough, I soon wound up humming along with Real Audio clips of ""One Mint Julep"" and ""Westchester Lady,"" even though I hadn't heard the real recording in well over a decade. This music was much cooler back in the 80's, though. Now when I listen to it I feel like I'm walking through some kind of super-funky grocery store."
5,FIRST TIME USER,"I LOVE RASPBERRY AND THESE ARE A PERFECT PICK ME UP DURING THE DAY WHEN I CRAVE SOMETHING SWEET - BUT NOT TOO SWEET. MY FRIENDS LOVE THEM, TOO. JUDY H."
5,Well-named CD!,"This CD is simply excellent from start to finish. You don't want to skip to just one song - this is meant to be played all the way through because there's not a bad song on it and they all just flow so nicely from one to the next, even though they're all good on their own. We call a book that we're glued to a ""page-turner""; this is the CD equivalent of such a book."
3,An Introduction Rather Than A Source,"It is a beautiful book, but I was disappointed that there wasn't more on actual lighting theory."
1,Quite a disappointment,"I love Cyndi, and have enjoyed all that she's done. But this disc is simply dull. She does get to show off her voice, and when in tune she sounds wonderful. But this is candlelight and wine music for people on downers. This might be the long sought after cure for insomnia."
1,5 stars--No way--get the orginal artists versions,"I cannot beleive that so many people rate this album at 5 stars. She is no Eva Cassidy, and I do not think she improved on the originals at all."
1,How could she?,"Honestly, I cannot understand these rave reviews. Half way through it the first time, I pronounced this CD ""unlistenable"" and turned it off. My husband wanted to hear it so I just endured the first few songs again. I was never a big Lauper fan, but I enjoyed her music and her uniqueness. I can't sing at all, but even I would be embarassed to release this CD. A major miscue, in my opinion."
2,Dissapointing,My son asked me what I wanted for Christmas..I told him the new Cyndi Lauper CD. Well..I've listened to it twice and it was worse the second time. I have been a Lauper fan for 20 years and was so looking forward to this CD. Her voice seems too thin and reedy for some of the material.I will take this CD to the resale store this week; hopefully can get something better in its place.
1,Her producer and sound guy should be shot!,"I purchased this CD thinking that Ms. Lauper would have created a lovely rendition of standards adding to it her unique voice and style. Boy was I disappointed.There is no flow, feeling, or point any of the songs. Only extremes in volume. And adventures in pitch-finding.Ms. Lauper's voice is unbelieveably loud and sharp, barely accompanied by faint instrumentals coming through a dampening field. Most songs on the album follow the aforementioned pattern except for one or two where her naked, slightly-hoarse voice competes mightily with annoyingly loud trumpets and drums.If you are looking for up-dated standards, try Diana Krall or Harry Connick Jr.If you're a Cyndi Lauper fan, get some of her older recordings.If you feel compelled to buy this, give it a listen first. Please."
1,George,"I bought this cd after seeing the video for ""At Last"" - thinking this would be a good purchase, boy was I wrong. This is dreadful, she seems to be cashing in on the current trend for remaking classic songs. She should stick to her old style, since this music doesn't fit her voice."
1,Just generally hard on the ears!,"If you just enjoyed a show on Cindi Lauper's recent world tour, which this CD is mistakenly named after, don't expect the same enjoyment from this disc.It has none of the old classics, first off - its solely covers of jazz standards (Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood, At Last, etc).And the quality of these covers is really disappointing. Her voice is simply not good enough for them. The arrangements are so bare, the background music so soft, that her voice is spotlighted - which it doesn't hold up well to. She has a unique voice - she should have stuck with her unique songs... Here, she's just trying to sing like Ella Fitzgerald, Sinatra and Co, and she does not shape up well next to them.To preserve your memory of Cindi Lauper, stick with her own wall of sound classics from the 80's, where her voice was put to good use - or even get the live DVD, which at least has her doing her own songs as well!"
1,Pac Man Fever,"This is one of the worst albums I've ever heard. Pac Man Fever is worse, but, then again, the arcade sounds were at least worth listening to."
2,What a waste,"With a promising ep of new material in 2002, I was expecting a great full-length cd of NEW MATERIAL from her, but we wound up with this. I like a few songs, mostly AT LAST and STAY, but overall am very disappointed. Seems to be jumping on the 'standards' bandwagon hoping to get the sales that Rod Stewart has fro his last 2 cds."
2,"Pleasant song selection, but..","Ms Lauper does not have the vocal range. Her interpretation of these classic songs is clearly handicapped by her rasping voice. She doesn't approach Carly Simon in an earlier album called ""Torch Songs."" Consider Joni Mitchel's wonderful recent album of standards with great orchestrations. Even Rod Stewart's album is more rewarding. I'm a bit surprised that Tony Bennet agreed to accompany Ms Lauper."
4,As Time Goes By,"some artists mature and become more expressive over time even if they record cover tunes or branch out into other/new musical areas. If you like albums like Bryan Ferry's ""As Time Goes By"" or Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach's ""Painted from Memory"", or even Norah Jones, you'll probably like this one as I did. I'm not previously a fan of Cindy Lauper, but this CD really shines. Awesome minimalist recording quality - with subtle details that can really make a ""high-end"" sound system shine. And oh... her voice. Expressive, powerful at times, dainty and delecate at others. Unlike another reviewer here, I REALLY like that Cindy adds her own quite different interpretation/rendition to these old classics. I think it would be boring otherwise. Her renditions make them sound new again."
1,"At Last, Cyndi Lauper","This was not at all what I expected. I liked most of her blues album but every song on ""At Last"" was terrible."
5,A CD for Every Pop and Jazz Enthusiast,"For every fan of Jazz and Pop music. If you want to hear one of the best cover CD's ""At Last"" is it. Cyndi Lauper can make the transition from her kooky pop induced vocals of She Bop we heard back in the 1980's, to a great interpreter of Pop and Jazz classics. She sings a wide range of favorites from Dionne Warwick to Jacques Brel, and her voice never lets the listener down. The arrangements are beautifully sparse, and Cyndi's voice penetrates through the lyrics. She has a really impressive vocal range, and infuses just the right emotion on Unchained Melody and the most gorgeous renditions of Hymn To Love and La Vie En Rose I've heard in a long while. This CD has it all and so does Cyndi Lauper."
1,Very dull CD. Must have been a budget recording...,Don't buy this CD it's a waste of money. First off sound mixing is real bad. I have to keep turning it up to hear at the start of a song then Cindy starts getting too loud and you have to turn it down. Did someone mix this in a garage?Also her voice and the music are very boring. Sounds like a 3-man band playing and Cindy giving a very lack-luster performance. I kept switching through the tracks looking for one good song. All of them are dull and boring..I wish I could get my money back...
2,Horrible!,"What happened to the Cyndi that just wanted to have fun? At Last has a more ""sohpisticated"" sound too it, no longer is she just having fun. When I, for the first time, heard the first few seconds of the first song, it sounded like songs one would hear on the Lady Sings the Blues album, at some moments, Norah Jones popped in my mind (maybe it's just me). I gave the album a two star rating, instead of a one star rating, due to the depth of the songs and the powerful voice singing them. Other than that, this CD is not ""fun"", it's just boring."
2,Mediocre,"I bought this book because the photo of the author, an American Indian, made me think I'd get a different kind of novel from the usual WASP horror cliches. But Goingback is not an elegant stylist, and his plot is hackneyed. The Native American elements were interesting--but not interesting enough to carry this pedestrian story."
2,lacking emotion,"I read this book based on the other reviews here, and I was sadly disappointed. The Characters lacked emotion, they did not react accordingly to any of the onslaught of these little otherworldly creatures...... no buildup, no climax per se. The best part about this book was the Photo of Owl on the inside back cover. Lacks bite."
3,Very confusing,"I agree totally with the reader who wrote that a simple list of characters would have helped. I too, thought the names were very confusing, Dafydd, Dyfrid, the dogs names so close to the men's names...ahhh. The names were also very long. I found myself having to go backwards to read to figure it all out. It was more work than enjoyment. I have read about 5 other Candance Robb books and I enjoyed this one the least. The others were very good."
4,Oh Seth!,"This was one of my favorite books as a kid. Don't remember too much about it, so I think I should buy it and relive it again."
1,laughable,"everything I've heard from hb has been rediculous other than ""I will be heard"".I bought under the knife a year ago,thought it was a ripoff,and gave it away.but a review advertising it brought back the bad memories.I also bought ""preservance""right when it came out thinking maybe it would be heavier and faster (with a guest appearance by kerry king-come on!)and while the song he's on is ok (""nation on fire"" or somthing like that)the rest was just boring and to quote jello biafra ""...like a bad laxative-it just don't move me,ya know?""If you're one of the thousands of slipknot/limp bizkit/korn fans out there you'll undoubtably love this stuff,but for those that know what else is out there and readily available-we'll stick with the REALLY heavy stuff like""cockoo clocks of hell"",any pantera,slayer,cryptopsy,fear factory,sepultura,etc,etc,etc...."
4,"GREAT SONGS, POOR RECORDING","HATEBREED is incredible -- song structure, lyrical themes, breakdowns. The ""Under the Knife"" EP captures the aforementioned components well but retains the all-too-familiar overloaded recording associated with bands on the rise. Pick up HATEBREED's ""Satisfaction is the Death of Desire"" if you don't already have it. If you are a dedicated fan, buy ""Under the Knife."" In either case, you'll end up bruised. Mark my words."
3,Good buy,So far it is a good product. I am still using it to learn Office. The thing I like about it is that the program will not let you move on until you do the right step. Sometimes it is frustrating but it is a good idea. I highly recommend this product to anyone who would like to learn MS Office
4,Solid,"I am a long time King Diamond fan, and am pretty happy with the King's new one. I heard quite a bit of it at the Puppet Master tour stop in Palo Alto before I purchased the album. I could tell hearing the new tunes live that the King returned to the sound and melodies of the late 80s instead of the difficult sounding albums of late. It works well on the album too. Simply put, if you like King, you will like the new one. Trivia- Listen to ""So Sad"" off of the Puppet Master and then listen to the title track of Black Sabbath's 1983 classic Born Again. The similarities are pretty striking. If you do not have Born Again there is something wrong with you."
3,Nothing Really Stuck,"First, the DVD was kind of a really silly gesture. It'a kind of, here's the story, if you're not bright enough to get it based off the lyrics in the music. Withouth knowing what it was, I bought the album because I thought (naively), wow, a DVD of all of King Diamond's music videos (ala, Rob Zombie, Primus, Pantera releases). Not so. The album itself? Owning all but the last two albums before this by King Diamond, the additional of female vocals just didn't work for me. I was used to, and liked, when he stretched for all vocal ranges. They work in ""Blue Eyes,"" but the rest? Eh... and the story? It's okay. He's done better. Listened to the album many times, and nothing really stuck. That's just the way it is..."
2,Not big enough for lunch,I bought this for my husband and he tried it but did not like it. It was not big enough for him (he only takes yogurt and something else small like applesauce or small bag of grapes). It did not keep his lunch cold enough either. And he puts his old lunch bag in his briefcase but this one would not fit. Maybe someone else in my family would use it.
2,Queen of this realm,This book is unlike any of her other books. this one is more dry and hard to read. it never grabbed me and pulled me in. I have loved all of her other books but this is one I wish I had passed on
4,This Book is Sure to Open Your Eyes!,"WOW! This book showed me, for the first time in my life, that I am not alone! If I got nothing else from this book, I discovered that there are other people like me - people who need to learn to live in the ""here and now"" and not wait for the ""glorious afterlife"". The majority of this book I found to be articulate and well thought-out. As another reviewer stated above, the inner child portion of the book was not terribly useful for me, but others may find it helpful. Overall, this is an excellent book and I recommend it highly."
3,Not for me,"I bought this book thinking it was the other book of the same title.It adresses the terrible psycological hurts and healing of the inner child that need to be done when you leave fundamentalism.I myself had no such difficulties. I ceased believing in God with as little trauma as when I ceased believing in Santa.If your deconversion is putting you through the wringer emotionally, then maybe this book is for you. But it was no use to me."
1,This product is not the same as what is pictured!,The colors are different. They are just the regular noodles with the hole down the middle and half of them are flower shaped. If you are looking for solid noodles these are not the ones you want.
3,Misleading ad,"The photo in the ad shows 4 noodles, one in each of four colors. I thought I was going to get four noodles, one in each color. The item description says ""one each...assorted colors..."". Ad should have read, ""one each, choose a color"" or, ""one each, seller will choose a color""."
1,"Not happy, advertised incorrectly","I think the wording for this ad is done very poorly. It reads like you will receive one of each color of the noodles for the price you pay. That is not the case. I would not have purchased this item had I understood that. I will not return this item; that would only cost more money. However, I will not purchase from this seller again."
5,A great book about a great man,"Zeev (meaning wolf, in hebrew) Jabotinsky was one of the greatest leaders ever, and the greatest liberal Zionist leader. His works can not be denied. Because of his many deeds, he was admired by many - and hated by the rest. And he is the subject of this book, like many other books and articles. But this one is special - the auther spent 7 years of his life reserching and writing it, and those seven years have beared fruit. The writing is of a very high quality, and the contence is extensive. Itws like no other book about Jabotinsky I know. After reading, you will enrich not only your mind - but also your spirit, by knowing this great man. Highly recomended, for all people - Zionists, students, and anyone seeking pure knolage and feeding."
4,SUPERB!!,"Just a year or so ago, I borrowed one of Karrin Allyson's previous CDs - ""From Paris to Rio,"" and her voice impressed me so much that I had to include this new one in my collection.This Kansas City gal demonstrates her ability to make a song her own distinctive property, and these blues-tinged offerings are no exception. Here, she tackles classic standards like ""Angel Eyes"" (Sinatra) and ""How Long Has This Been Going On?"", breathes new life into Bobby Troup's ""Meaning of the Blues,"" takes her own personal spin on Oscar Brown's ""Hum Drum Blues"" and ""Long as You're Living,"" Bonnie Raitt's ""Love Me Like a Man,"" and swings her way through ""Moanin'"" and Wes Montgomery's ""West Coast Blues."" There are 13 tracks on this CD...hard to pick one standout.Kudos to the talented musicians who backed Karrin up on this outing. Let's hope that another Grammy nod is in this talented lady's resume!!"
1,HEADLINE: WAYANS' gold movie making ticket REVOKED,You mean to tell me that in all the U.S. In all the wonderful talent and wonderful comedic screenplays that are written every year... this is it?This is the movie that Hollywood decides to make?Did Hollywood learn anything after the completely inept WHITE CHICKS? You know... Pauly Shores career ended after making JURY DUTY. The Wayans' should have been done after White Chicks.
4,"You go, little man","What makes this film fun is the character Calvin, the little man. The special effect is very well done and Marlon Wayans is very effective at being tough and vulnerable in the role. What makes this so much fun is that Calvin is an underdog; he is a tough guy in a small body who learns love by pretending to be a child. He also learns that he can even the playing field for others who need a little help in life. Not quite as creative as ""White Chicks"", but there are genuine laughs and the end is surprisingly satisfying. The Wayans brothers are so creative. Recommended."
4,This movie won't win any Oscars...,"... but that doesn't mean it isn't a funny film. It's not as well-written or cutting-edge as Clerks II, but it still provides the viewer with a lot of laughs, especially if you enjoyed the Wayans Brothers' work on the first two Scary Movies and their woefully short-lived sitcom a few years back.This is the type of comedy film you go to just for an escape. It isn't grounded in reality nor does it present humor that makes you think. It's something you watch, knowing full well it's only there for you to laugh at.Personally, I'd take this raucous yet little-promoted movie over overhyped ""star-studded"" comedies like The Break-Up and You, Me and Dupree any day."
2,Check facts,"I was doing ok with the book. Not exactly drawing me in but then when Chase is working on his ""fifty-seven Camaro"", that was the end for me. I am not a big car buff but thought that sounded way too early for a Camaro. Googled it and in two seconds saw they were first made in sixty-seven.That was the end of the book for me. To me it puts into question any and all facts I expect the author to have checked. Besides again, it just was a bit far fetched."
2,Maybe bother if you can get it for free...,"The book had potential as a good poolside read on a lazy Sunday, and it started off fairly decent. By about 1/3 through, however, it failed miserably. I downloaded it when it was free, which is why I rated it 2-stars, otherwise I would have only given it a 1-star rating.For the most part, I can suspend disbelief in my readings...that is why we read after all, is to get away from our lives for a few hours. However, every character was completely unrealistic, as was every situation. At the end of the day, I felt like I was reading a 16 year-old's diary of what it would be like to lose her virginity and what she would consider porn.Don't waste your money."
2,1957 Camaro??,"I got to the part in the book where the author talks about a 1957 Camaro that doesn't exist, and I couldn't read any further. (The first year of the Camaro was 1967.) The story was already dragging, but when something that blatantly wrong pops up in a book, then I don't see the point in wasting my time to read further. I got about 30% through this book before I gave up.. I tried! Another reviewer had a similar opinion, I saw.I have purchased other ebooks by Rita Herron (when they were free), and I do plan on trying to read those. Maybe they're better!"
2,neutral in this corner,"What can I say? This is a story of a hero in angst and a tender hearted virgin. The brothers were distracting in their overzealous protection of their sister. It has a very small and under developed plot. For me it was formulatic, if I can coin a word, and predictable.Also, in my opinion, the Savannah setting could have been more utilized. Having said that, I confess to a love of fiction where the setting almost becomes a supporting character. The references to bayous and voodoo were a bit confusing for me . But I am not very well traveled so what do I know from low country or bayou?It was free. I consider that to be a generous offer. It appears that many people are enjoying this book. Try it for yourself."
5,Great Science Resource,This is an excellent resource that my family and I take with us when we go out for nature walks. There are lots of pictures that we use to compare what we see along the way. The descriptions and facts help us learn what we never knew before. Great for homeschooling families.
4,Excited About Nature,"We purchased this book for our two little ones and have enjoyed running to get the book when we see unusual and interesting bugs, leaves, etc. outside in our natural wonderland of a back yard! We even keep the book on the bookshelves in the kitchen for fast reference! I have noticed that not everything we have wanted to look up is in the book but not everything can be and we are very pleased with the book as a whole. I do wish there were colored pictures to help me identify certain creatures when I'm not 100% sure ""that is it""."
3,The Hardback Version Is Missing Some Things,"I want to first say that The Handbook of Nature Study is one of my very favorite books. I have loved my paperback copy so much that it eventually fell apart (in half actually) and so my husband ordered the hardback copy this time. I was surprised when it came in that the photos were very faint, as if they were xerox copies of the version I had before. The greatest shock, however, came when I went to look something up in Part IV of the book and found that the hardback version has just left that whole section out!! It stops right where Part IV should begin. I am very disappointed in the hardback version and would suggest to everyone to get the paperback version."
3,Scotch Mailing Tube,mailing tube is OK and good for a single mailing... it is obvious that the tube had been used before...
5,Amazon ships damaged product,"I gave the DVD five stars, as the show is great, there is perhaps nothing I can add to the previous reviews. However, take note that Amazon has been sending me ""new"" DVDs that appear clearly used, with the packaging completely damaged. I recommend the whole series to everyone, just do yourself a favor and buy it elsewhere, or pay half price to get a used item sold as used.The first time (another Seinfeld DVD) the packaging looked only slightly damaged. Perhaps someone dropped it once before packaging, I thought. This time, however, the box that contains the four discs was torn along one of the edges, and all corners of it were damaged. It looks like someone played soccer with it for a while.It is a shame that Amazon sells discs in such condition.Note that once you take the DVDs out of their plastic wrap (I had to before I could see the box is torn), you can get back at most fifty percent of the original price, making it worthless to return."
1,Captures well but thats all,"A nice piece of hardware but that all.There is absolutely no functionality other than capturing the MPG file to the MAC.For those who are not aware mpg2 is virtually not supported on the Mac.The I-life suite offers no mpg editing nor does the Final cut express.For this hardware to claim to be for the Mac one would assume that it would export into I-Movie or offer some sort of mpg editing software.To be fair what it does it does well, but without even the most basic editing functions I had to return my unit. And certainly would warn others off."
1,POS - put your money in a pile and watch it burn,"Here is why I found this toaster to be a POS:Uneven heat - different slots will brown or burn toast before other slots even warm up.Unmarked controls - who can tell what the control switches do as they are unmarked.Wont fit larger bread - bagels, challah, or large slices wont fit.Entire unit gets too hot - will melt nearby plastics.Bad customer service - try contacting Dualit and see what happens.They wont be there for you as they are laughing all the way to the bank.If you are considering spending $300.00 on a toaster this one isn't it.The Dualit toaster has very poor engineering, poor build quality, bad design, and lacking customer service."
1,13 years and my 2nd Dualit just died,"I bought my first Dualit in the 90s. I thought a $350. toaster would last a lifetime. The first one lasted eight years. I thought maybe I got unlucky since I live alone and don't eat that much toast. Because I love the design I bought another. Both were four slice. The first one just stopped working. This one has been sneakier. It has stopped toasting one side on 2 of the slots and stopped entirely on the other 2. Now I'm standing close by and flipping the toast over manually. I don't know if I'm going to buy a third yet. I'm a sucker for this design, but I'm incredibly disappointed in this appliance that should have been a once in a lifetime purchase."
3,"I love mine, but not for everybody","The worst part of this is it does not handle lightly toasted soft breads well. If you like baely toasted Sunbeam or Wonder bread, this is not the toaster for you, as the mechanism that will raise the toast will also likely squish it.But if you like medium to dark toast and use hearty bread, this is a workhorse, excellnt for a large family. It takes a little warming up until it is calibrated to put out toast consistantly, but once it is warm it is non-stop toast for 20. Brunch ahoy!"
3,Lucky Thirteen,"The dialogue in this book is a little stilted and awkward in some places, but otherwise the book's okay. Jean and Pierre live in the Greenview Hotel, where Jean's father is the manager and Pierre's father is the chef. They are allowed to play in the empty rooms on the thirteenth floor and keep their pet, a black cat, there. All is going well for them until a valuable ruby necklace (with thirteen large rubies and thirteen small rubies) that belongs to a prominent guest disappears. The guest first blames the children, saying that they carelessly left her door unlocked. Then, she becomes convinced that Pierre's father is the culprit and demands that he be arrested and that Jean's father resign from his position because of the theft. To save their fathers, Jean and Pierre must find the rubies and discover who the real thief is. Not a bad mystery for kids who are just getting into chapter books."
3,Will stick with bars,Not really what I expected from a nutritional supplement made me sweat more than it gave me energy. Will stick with energy bars.
5,It was the Egret that Started It....,"I haven't read this book in probably 25 years...but I can quote you the first line: It was the egret that started it....who can resist on a glorious day following it high overhead - well not an exact quote anymore but well enough. In other words, this book IMPRINTED on me as a teenager. The mystery, the romance, the foreign location, the beauty, the lushness of the scenery! Notice I didn't even say, the written description of the lushness - you just forget you're reading when you're reading Mary Stewart! It's like a Mary Poppins painting - you step into it and you are there! For her time, one of the best author's alive writing! If you've recently ""re-discovered"" her, have a great time living other lives...."
1,Maranatha review,I wish I could review it for you but I'm still waiting for it to arrive. How long does it take because I received the other items.
3,Nice,I really liked James and Natalie's blending together. That is what good acting is all about. However the story line was just okay.
5,Classic,"Simply a must have for any true hip hop head. This masterpiece contains the groundwork for what we now know as the breakin' bells of RUN DMC's classic, ""peter piper""."
4,A great library addition!,"This is my all-time favorite book. My copy is so worn I have to use a rubber band to keep it together. It is a great story about making the best of things, pretending to be who you are not and ultimately, coming to terms with the truth - and the freedom that that brings! I loved every single character!"
3,"A silly excuse for a movie, really.","I bought this for a friend because one of the actors in the movie (Lee Rhodes) was ""a friend of a friend.""The premise is stupid (a tree coming to life and walking, possessed by the spirit of a wrongly executed person). The possessed tree begins killing those who were responsible for his murder.If you know someone who was IN this movie (as my friend did), I'd recommend getting it."
3,I'd be so disappointed if I paid $69.99 for these...,"I bought them for $5.00 at the baby sale about a year ago and that was fine, but this new price is insane."
2,Good Product for the Price,An ok product for the very low price. DOes nto stay lit for more than a few seconds though but is good for a bckup unit for the trunk of the car.
1,Dremen got hosed,Financial crises finally got Dremen. Dip buying is not without risks. As long as stocks you buy survives then u are good.Last crises dremen was buying fannie freddie and aig as if there was no tomorrow.
4,Contrarian Strategies Backed with Statistical Evidence,"I enjoyed the book & appreciated the fact that Dreman backed most of his assertions with historical & statistical facts. I found the sections on investor psychology & EMT/EMH a bit slow, but conceive the importance of both in the context of understanding, and using contrarian strategies.Overall, I recomend the book because I believe it has something to offer to most anyone who reads it (...)"
2,Simplistic and Naive View of Investing,"Although David Dreman has been known as one of the leading Contrarians on Wall Street, his current views are even more controversial. With this latest endeavor, it seems that his simplisitc opinions on investing still abound. I found the book condescending and trivial at points where the author seemed to prefer trashing his competitors rather than proving an investment point. The chapter that encourages people to steer away from all NASDAQ companies was actually a bit frightening. Where would we be without Microsoft, Intel, and Cisco, just to name a few stellar companies that call the NASDAQ home? It can also be argued that many of the studies shown in his book are either not statistically significant or are ambivalant. The old saying, ""With statistics you can prove any point"" is quite true with this book. While Dreman may have been a succesful investor, I found myself fighting to complete this book before his self-praise became too overwhelming."
3,eh.,"Did not like this one as much as the first in the Frankenstein series.I dislike the O'Connor character. Her whole ""tough guy"" persona is annoying and kind of hacky.O'Connor and Maddison's only communication with each other consists entirely of ""witty banter"" where they swap snappy one-liners back and forth. It's tiresome and unrealistic.By the middle of the book, I didn't care what happened to whom. They can all be killed off as far as I cared."
1,**** DEFECTIVE **** DO NOT BUY **** Missing 7 Chapters,Do not buy this unless you look through it to be sure everything is there. I got to chapter 21 only to find out that after chapter 21 it repeats 8-21 and then goes to 28. I am missing chapters 22-28. Make sure you check to see all the chapters are in order BEFORE you buy.
1,Poor Quality,"I realize I bought a used book but the description was Good Shape. I take this to mean some dog eared pages, binder a little bent, maybe a couple marks. I received it with tremendous water damage, and I know it was shipped this way as the pages were dry. Terrible seller!"
1,Stop at Two,"First let me say that I am an avid fan of Dean Koontz and really enjoy the books he has written BY HIMSELF. However, from the plot, characters, and stytle of this one, it is obvious that he did not write it.The story line (what little there is) is shallow, the characters very predictable, and the little side jokes very juvenile.With no pun intended, Dean, you really need to get yourself a better ghost writer than the character who did this one."
4,Thrilling!,"Koontz's novels are very uneven, some are very good and some are very bad. This is one of the good ones.Very spooky, exciting. A real page turner for me as I kept turning page after page to find out what was happening to each of the characters in the book. All of the characters had great depth, even the new Race ones. Can't wait to see how it all ends. Much better than the first book."
4,don't buy this : i'd give it 0 stars but i put 4 by accident,"most of the tracks on this CD aren't worth it. i mean, it seems as if the majority of them are rappers talking about how they're such pimps...that's not what i call music. and the lyrics can get pretty vulgar, too.don't waste your money. there are better now cds out there.seriously."
3,Now That's What I Call Mediocre,"They just tried too hard to please everyone with this one. So everybody is going to have a handfull of tracks that they love, a bunch that they wish weren't there, and yet more that they think are missing. Next time I'd like to see separate albums like ""Now That's What I Call Pop,"" ""Now That's What I Call Rock,"" ""Now That's What I Call Rap"" etc."

3,A little better...but Now 4/5 still beat it.....,"There have been some real misses in the NOW series as of late. NOW 14 is a little better....but they could have picked a little more wisely. There is just too much r&b here. I was wondering when I was going to get to some rock music! NOW 4 and 5 are the best ones of this series so far....they comprise a good mix of teen pop from 1999/2000....r&b and rock tunes. NOW 14 is okay....but if this one gets you....go back and get the earlier ones I mentioned. Standouts on this compilation are TRAPT, BLACK EYED PEAS, and MURPHY LEE."
5,solo sider,"Wow, who ever thought this up was really thinking about the single person doing the job. This was a life saver and cool tool.Thanks,Tom"
3,satisfied its purpose,"The only reason I bought this book was for a terrible linguistics class, but the book itself isn't bad... Probably the best read for the semester in the class. I just don't think I ever would have picked this up otherwise... Seeing as I'm a math major..."
1,Might as well sleep on the floor,"I purchased this mattress to go with our new bunk beds. The beds turned out better than expected but this piece of foam sold to me as a mattress was ridiculous! Not only is it not safe for a child to sleep on them, it it unacceptable that this could be marketed through Amazon!! Dont let the picture fool you, it is 2 inches in thickness and too short/small for a bunk bed. Shame on both of you (Amazon and YDF)!!"
2,Camera is all over the place,"This movie made my eyes hurt! The camera is all over the place, other then that it's not so bad. I wouldn't buy it."
1,Either it's a ...,"I saw the title and thought that this has got to be a well constructed satire on so-called ""exploitation"" films (a deceptive name to make cheap seem respectable) or it's really a cheaply conceived and produced movie.The old storyline of a dead body suddenly showing up and some innocent people make a series of dumb decisions (so a movie can be made and an audience can say ""Dumb decision!"". Briefly, two sisters, a girlfriend and some religious guy drive around with a dead body in the trunk trying to dispose of the body while avoiding the usual drug gangsta and true killer. His scenes add up to about 5 minutes and thankfully because his acting consists of wearing a hoodie.If you like dumb dialogue, poor acting and lots of scenes of an old car and a couple of rooms then this low budget movie is for you."
4,Timeless wise craft,The book is well presented and informative. Buckland's work is timeless and has stood the test of time. His work is not fluffy and has strong ethics.
3,Another Informative Read from Joyce Meyer,"Joyce Meyer writes a much needed and very pertinent topic for today's Christian. ""How To Hear From God"" spoke directly to what I am seeking in my relationship with God right now - more of Him! She offers Biblical advice on seeking direction for decision-making based on God's will. Filled with thought-provoking discussion questions at the end of each chapter, this would be a wonderful reading group pick for those desiring to hear from God.My only issue with this book is: when are we going to quit buying and reading books such as these and get into the Bible!?! That's where the answers are. These self-help books don't tell you anything that the Bible doesn't already say. There is no quick fix from a self-help book! Get into the Word!"
3,"Love the book, don't love Joyce reading it","Wow was I disappointed... I love to hear Joyce preach! I love to read her books! She is so anointed! And she always speaks to me. However, maybe it's just me, but this audiotape wasn't the same. When she read the book she wrote, I found it to be dry and without life. How to Hear from God is another of her great books! Please don't discount the book if you didn't like the audiotape of it being read. I won't get another tape of her reading her books. I'll just continuing listening to her teaching tapes, reading her books, and watching her programs on tv and online."
5,Grover rules!,"My best friend's daughter just turned 1, and since this is my sons' and husband's favorite bedtime story (i still have to read it to my 11 yr olds sometimes) we got it for her. She loved it! She mostly liked pushing it around on the carpet, but she also liked looking at the pictures and trying to turn the page (always the wrong way). I'm sure as she grows it will be a favorite of hers too."
5,AWESOME,I COULD NOT BELIVE HOW WONDERFUL THIS SERVICE IS..I MAY NEVER GO TO A BOOK STORE AND PAY FULL PRICE AGAIN!!!
5,My favorite book as a child.,This was always my favorite book as a child and I am so happy to be passing it along to my children! My 2 year old LOVES this book:)
5,My daughter LOVES it!,"My MIL recently gave us a few books from my husband's childhood and this book was among them. My daughter is 3 and absolutely LOVES it! She giggles throughout the whole thing and loves it when Mommy and Daddy do their ""Grover"" voice. We've just had it since last week and she already has in memorized and likes to ""read"" it to us. I'm actually considering obtaining another copy just in case something happens to this one! LOL!I HIGHLY recommend it. It's short and sweet and your kids will love it! :)"
5,Great book!,"I read this book to my children, many moons ago. I just purchased a book for each of them so they, in turn could enjoy it with their children. It is truly a classic."
5,Best book ever!,This is the best children's book ever! I have the best memories of my parents reading it to me as a child. I often buy this book as a gift for friends and family.
5,Bringing Back Memories :),I can remember sitting around and having this book read to me as a child. It was so beat up by the time we got through with it. My folks read it so much to me that I had memorized each page pretty much word-for-word. The surprise ending is still AWESOME!! :) even to this day.
4,Doesn't fit top of Uppa Baby Vista correctly,This is very warm and soft but unfortunately the top part of the Bundle Me doesn't have an opening to be able to access the release to tilt the seat up and down. I have the 2009 Vista.
3,Almost great,"I had the infant size BundleMe and it fit in my car seat carrier perfectly. I got the toddler size for my 15 month old and tried to attach it to my stroller...no such luck. The BundleMe does not work with CityMini strollers. I wish someone had mentioned that before I bought it - the design/color and concept are great, I just can't really use it all that well with my stroller."
3,decent,"I really loved this when my baby was a newborn. She is now 4 months old. A few things to note:It's weather-resistant unlike a blanket, which was nice when it was snowing or drizzling.We had a Chicco Keyfit. This does not fit the Chicco very well. It's a little too small so it was always pulling funny and sliding off the car seat. The Chicco is a bit bigger than other car seats so that's not particularly surprisingBy the time she was about 3 months old (average sized 3 month old) it was starting to be a little too small. This might be because it didn't fit the car seat too terribly well to begin with.It says machine washable, but the first time I put it in the washer--gentle cycle, by itself--it completely fell apart. And, it's not really fixable because of the type of fabric."
5,Love it,It's so warm and cozy! He usually gets too hot and I'm never worried about him getting cold. Very happy
4,great bundle,great bundle but doest work great with city baby stroller.id impossible to set it in a way that it want move
5,great product!,"Great for winter use! Works better in carseat than it does in our strollers (Kolcraft-due to straps in strollers), but it did keep our daughter super warm during Christmas in Park outing!"
2,not long enough/ does not work with chicco keyfit!,"Such a great idea, and very soft and warm, however, does not work for our long little girl in her chicco keyfit 30. This is just more trouble than it is worth, fits awkwardly, and I am constantly having to fish the straps out from underneath, so frustrating! I was hoping to use this all winter, but our 7 month olds feet are jammed into the bottom and she looks uncomfortable. So far the biggest waste of money on a baby product, wish i had purchased something else to serve the same purpose, there are many other options out there. Don't claim that this product is universal- it's not!!!"
2,"doesn't fit well on the chicco keyfit, but it does keep her warm","I don't know if it fits better on another brand of car seat, but the fit on the chicco keyfit, is all wonky, it doesn't cover all of the top, and it runs quite short. We were up in Conn. during a snowstorm over Halloween weekend recently, and being from VA, i wanted to make sure she stayed warm, so i got some tight and this to supplement what clothes i had with me to keep her warm. It did keep her warm, but it doesn't even go to the end of the car seat on either end, and my husband hates to try and buckle her in with it as he has a hard time find where straps have gone, its a good thing i don't think we will be using it long as shes over 6 months now. I posted pictures because i wanted to see how they fit before buying one initially, and nowhere did i find pictures of them on different brand seats."
5,Excellent product !!,"This bundleme is wonderful, we had the small one for the carsest, which was great but was far too small for the stroller now that Maggie is older, but the big one is great, she is warm and cozy and it fits my Peg stroller perfectly - couldn't be happier with it- just wish it was availble in Canada or at least Amazon.ca to save on the shopping and handling but still well worth the price"
3,Does not work with Chicco car seat,"This item did not fit on my Chicco Keyfit 22 car seat. It seemed soft and warm, but I had to return it. I'm glad I did since the baby gets very warm in the car seat and probably would have gotten too warm with this. Blankets have been working just fine for running from car to store."
5,A must have!,"This has been definitely one of my favorite products this past winter.I live in New York City and walk everywhere with my daughter. I was worried about the winter, but armed with the Bundle Me we continued walking everywhere most of the winter.It works great with the Uppababy Vista and kept her really warm. I also loved this Soho color.Only suggestion for improvement would be to have a zipper at the bottom, so wet feet/boots can be kept on the outside and not ruin the bundle me.And as others have suggested, buy the toddler. I used the Toddler size with my newborn (3-6 months) and it worked just fine. And I'm happy I won't have to buy another size for next winter."
1,These are not safe,Using this product voids the warranty on your carseat because it interferes with the harness of the seat. Please avoid!
4,Warm and nice looking,"I love this product. It keeps my son warm and looks great, it leaves him plenty of space to move around but covers him up very well. He feels and looks very cozy."
1,Doesn't fit the Peg Perego Primo Viaggio,This cover did not fit my Primo Viaggio at all. The wings for the side impact made it so the back of the cover didn't lay flat against the seat. I imagine this would be a problem for any carseat with a lot of side impact protection.
2,No pictures,Where the hell are the pictures for the book in the Kindle cloud reader???? Am I doing something wrong? Please help me
4,"So Far, So Good","It sounds great. I'll come back and let you know how it works in November, when my next blood test is scheduled."
3,"Good information, bad condition","The book is very good, and has a lot of useful information. But, the condition of the book was not good. It came with a lot of pages falling out."
2,glucose loading diet,The book is just repackage of all the info of carb counting diet. I would keep to the South Beach or the Carbohydrate diet programs.
3,Glycemic Loads listed in the book are all wrong,"I have diabetes and became quite interested in the glycemic load. I have developed a program that calculates the glycemic load from the glycemic index and the amount of carbohydrates in the item. I have a program that I installed on the iPad and have verified EVERY number found using my program. EVERY number for the glycemic load in this book has failed to verify. The information listed in the book appears to be correct, but do not believe any of the glycemic loads listed. I always tell people ""Don't take my word for it, do the calculation yourself."" At first, I thought my program had a problem in it when it kept giving answers WAY lower than those in the book. When I finally checked against other web sites and the data in the database on the iPad, EVERY number from my program was verified indicating ALL the numbers in the book for glycemic load are WRONG."
3,glycemic diet,"This the third book I have read on this subject and found it no different from the others.However, this book is in a more simple language and easier to understand."
5,QUIT DIETING FOREVER!!,"SO happy to have found this book and the safest and easiest way to shed pounds!!It makes sense and is not complicated, like no calorie counting, no weighing food, you CAN eat fruit, fat and meats.....simple!!"
5,"""Principles of Marketing"" is worth to be read!!!!!!!!!","Dear Mr. Kotler I was vey excited while reading your book. My opinion is that this book professionally written and full of interesting facts and examples. Thank you!!! I would be very surprised to receive a catalog of all the books you have published or just going to. Thank you ones again. Alex A. Shevchenko Kiev, Ukraine"
1,Brain Dead,"Looking for life-like characters? Looking for realistic interaction among them? Maybe a little bit of chilling suspense or a tantalizing romantic subplot? Then don't read this book. This is genre writing at its worst -- lacking even the most basic human elements necessary to draw a slightly thoughtful reader into the novel. I found it flat and simply boring. The attempt at integrating a romantic interlude was insultingly stupid. If Cook were not published previously, this work would never had made the book stand."
4,Amazon Purchase - Robin Cook - Brain,"Very interesting story line(s). Actually, it was quite shocking. Quick read, but need to pay attention to Cook's constant switching to his subplots."
3,"Average, but Cook has done better.","Interesting book when it comes to the idea of the medical field experimenting on humans. In this case, it's women who are patients at the GYN clinic. Heavy on the medical terminology, and Cook seemed to lose his focus for the ending which was disappointing. I wouldn't recommend the book to first time readers of Cook, as he's done better."
5,Bolt gave me a jolt.,"I a Francis fan. He took on a hard subject and he did a good job. How can a story fail when it has a three generation family feud, a French villian, a princess, and last but not least, horses?"
4,Revenge Stalks the Stables,"Do not read this sequel until you've read BREAK IN. Francis continues the story of the hate obsessed Maynard Allardeck vendetta against Kit Fielding who destroyed his chances of knighthood. Many readers may not understand the revenge motif that drives the villein without having the background of the earlier book. BOLT and BREAK IN are companions, which can stand alone, but are much more savory together.Kit has more problems as he may lose his new love to a young prince from her own world ""who doesn't have the courtesy to be bad looking.""The killer is always known in this story, but proving who is killing Kit's best rides is another question.Enjoy, Bolt is anything but humane.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and QUALIFYING LAPS."
3,"good hero, bad ""bad guy,"" justice triumphs","Kit Fielding, scion of an old family, thwarts a fiendish Frenchman who seeks to force the proud but ailing husband of a racehorse owner to trade in guns. Along the way, Kit befriends and bests a prince in a civilized competition for the beautiful Danielle, and finally defeats his hereditary rival, Maynard Allardeck."
4,What's not to like?,"I am always pleased after I finish a Dick Francis novel. Kit Fielding is the leading man Francis loves to give us. He's charming, unflappable, and a little out of place in his profession, yet isn't invincible, and isn't the luckiest in love. We have three storylines here that are woven together expertly and in unexpected ways. Kit is asked by his friend that he rides for, Princess Casilia, to help them fend off an over-exuberant business partner who says he'll do anything to get what he wants. As if that weren't enough, a racing rival is out to get him, and he's pretty sure his fiancé is going to leave him for the Princess's nephew. Just when we are sure the story is going one way, everything takes a left turn. This is an author that will always be on my to-read list."
1,An absolutely terrible purchase!,"Joshua Bell is to the violin what Sarah Brightman and Andrea Bocelli are to opera... embarrasing dissappointments!!! I am a violinist, and I can't stand to see my instrument disgraced like this!These are beautiful pieces, and should not be ruined by Bell's mediocre performance standards. I watched him perform ""O mio babbino"" on the Colin O'Brian show with his harp and musical following, and found it very difficult to listen. I would only reccommend this music to those whom have no idea what they're really listening to, and certainly NOT to any serious violinist or opera enthusiast! Don't waste your money."
5,A beautiful cd for ANY collection,"I first got my interest in Joshua Bell by hearing his rendition of ""O Mio Babbino Caro"" and I absolutely loved it, so i just had to buy this cd. Although ""O Mio..."" is a gorgeous song, EVERY song on this cd is absolutely beautiful in every aspect. This is the first classical cd I ever bought, and even though classical music isn't my normal listening music, I am so glad I decided to buy ""Romance..."" For any music fan who appreciates true skill and beautiful music, this cd is for you!"
3,Broken,I bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter. When she ope ned it on Christmas day the mirror was broken.I email the company the same day and was told the replacement part would be sent the next day. We have still not received the mirror and no one will answer my emails.
3,Realize the poor and downtrodden were in years past as they are now.,"The names were a little unfamilar and reading of years past having difficult times reminds us of sometimes the more things change, the more they stay the same. Depressing thought."
2,BRIO 50 Piece natural wooden block set,These blocks are very small and not at all what I was expecting. Maybe I did not read the description closely.
5,Nothing better for the imagination,"With all the high tech toys out there, it's great to get back to the basics. Both of my son and daughter enjoy building houses, forts, 'space castles' and more. This a great item for the kids and fun for Dad too."
2,Hindi masyong maganda,Konti lang ang nagustuhan ko dito sa Heads Album niya. Malalim masyado ang mga selections. Nakaka-antok.
5,Connie,Connie Francis has such a distinctive voice and I remembered it well from my younger years. She had quite a few hits and all of the ones I remember are on this cd. I like the cd a lot and I'm happy I bought it because it brings back a lot of memories...
4,Good Overview of this Industry!,"Shaner takes you inside to the very center of the brothel from the women who work there, to the customers to the mundane but necessary operations that keep the whole thing afloat. She even dares to tackle the subject of systematic racism in this industry, which is something I have NEVER seen done in any other book on this issue. The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because in the beginning, Shaner uses a lot of obvious puns and one-liners that are irritating and distracting to read. Once you get past that,however, this is a very informative book."
4,All marketers are liars,"And this is a marketed book for sure. The book itself is very easy to read, one of the reasons may be that there's not so much in the book itself. Really it's not even a book, more a large booklet, but if you like the kind of ""on my desk - random manual for everyday business life"" - buy it."
1,This has to be the most overated book on amazon.,"Here is the first few lines of the chapter beginning on page 162:Play is tactile... Play is revealing...Play is active... Play is cultural...Play is experimental... Play is knowledge...Play is imaginative... Play is curious...In fact the entire chapter is 2 pages long consisting only of stuff like this. The rest of the book is slightly better.If you like this kind of stuff then buy it. If you prefer something interesting to read and useful, I would recommend spending about the same amount of money on The Power of Simplicity."
4,Out of this world.,Never would I of thought that there would be a book as good as this one. It had duel aliens and war. Would recommend it to all my SciFi geeks
2,Shallow Scifi,"If you like hard science fiction which seems to have any basis in logic, this is not it. The authors aliens are described as large mouthed seals on steroids, a spacefaring race which conquers Earth yet finds the human techology, in some cases, equal to, if not superior. Go figure."
3,Flimsy Paper detracts from experiance,"Both the binding and cover are of very high quality, but I was quite disappointed with the quality of the paper that the journal is actually made of. Though each page is lined on both sides pen ink bleeds through to the back quite dramatically. All and all I would not recommend, and will not buy again."
3,Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward Our Spiritual North Star...,at this time I have not read it. Jury still out. mailing and condition acceptable.
2,Rediscovering Catholicism,Matthew Kelly knows how to motivate people . I enjoyed his style of writing and the story flowed.
1,Rediscovering Catholism: Journying Toward Our Spiritual North Star,"same book as ""Rediscover Catholicism"" just a different addition!do not understand why that wasn't told to me in the discription of the book!!"
3,Concepts are nice but reading it is terse,I think it was a pretty decent writing but certain parts can be hard to follow and i thought a combination of code + graphics would make it an even better read
2,A Valentine to Truman,"Well researched and very readable, McCullough has produced the best biography of Truman yet published. McCullough's narrative is rarely critical of Truman's actions, but he's such a great story teller that you hardly notice. For readable biographies, this book is second only to Robert K. Massie's ""Peter the Great."""
3,History,"Some very critical decisions reviewed. Good insight into Roosevelt's personality. On the negative, far too much exhausting detail to wade through."
5,So clean even out of mud,"It is fascinating---full display of President Truman's character. Let along ""the buck stops here"" he was so clean although out of mud. In KC, as the county judge managing hundreds millions of dollars for construction contracts he could easily pocket millions. When he was sent to DC as the Senator of Missouri by Pendergast (the powerful big Boss) many on the Hill believed he was rich until a aid saw him took an apartment of $5 rent per month and took a loan from a bank to buy furniture. On the campaign road for his second term, he slept in his car because he did not have money to pay a hotel room... hope we can find today's politicians like that. It is a must read for anybody likes history."
5,I Like Harry,"What a wonderful story. You have to love this man. If you like the presidents and history, you will like this story. Once he got his start; he was good. He was great. The almost one thousand pages told some wonderful stories. Hopefully we will have another president like Harry."
5,Truman,"David McCullough writes the best, most throughly researched books I have ever read. I have only read Truman and John Adams. I intend to read all of his works."
5,A level look at a level man!,"I enjoyed this book a great deal! Very hard to put down. While I have questions perhaps about this and that, I sat down at my desk each night and went through the life of President Truman in a few weeks time. I would recommend this to everyone! Mr. McCullough hit another one into the stands! I'm looking into 1776 now! Thank you!"
4,Get it.,"Five stars out of five for the coverage of Truman's early political career and six out of five for his campaign against Dewey. These parts of the book are absolutely gripping.I'd give the book as a whole 4 and a half stars. It can get a little dry at other parts, perhaps because of the superb attention to detail of the author, an acceptable vice, perhaps due to the nature of the subject, an unavoidable obstacle. All in all, a highly entertaining and superbly informative read."
3,Truman- very readable,"Truman, the book I ordered , arrived on time. The dust jacket was a bit tattered, but otherwise it was fine. No markings inside and very clean. I am happy with this purchase,"
3,Interesting - yet too wordy and a bit one sided.,This book could have benefited from the hand of an editor determined to cut out some of the slower moving passages. I skipped paragraphs and sometimes pages without finding I'd missed anything of consequence when I went back to see if I was being too harsh. Over all it is a good read but probably should have been a 750 page book instead of a thousand. It also tends to defend most of Truman's actions while criticizing those of opposite viewpoints. Truman's devotion to the political machine in his home state begs for more in depth analysis than the author gives it. All in all I reccommend this book but also suggest that other authors be read before forming a definitive conclusion on this complex and interesting person.
4,Factual and well written,"I give Truman four stars as the book is factual, well written and full of personal glimpses of Harry Truman the man."
5,Truman,This is a great book. The author brings history to life. Read several of his books and they are all great.
5,2 Druunas for the price of one!!!,"Just like Carnivora before it, and Clone after it, Serpieri has a knack for constructing multiple-Druuna stories, though this is the only one of the three where the two Druunas ever interacted without one trying to kill her, or her needing to enter her previous body! Que ironico, out of all the bisexual woman scenarios Serpieri has lathered this series down with, he has never once dared have the two Druunas do it with each other! Good god, man, I'd pay big money to see that!!! Two Druunas, jaybird to the heels, embracing, kissing, and then taking each other to the very edge of mortal orgiastic Nirvana?!?! I'd buy THAT for a DOLLAR!!! AAAHHHAAA!!!"
1,Book missing 3 chapters,Chapters 22-27 were not in the book. It was missing pages 192-226. The book would be much better with all of the chapters.
2,"It was an interesting book, filed with many twists and turns","This book is a good book if you like stories filled with culture and information. I for one prefer fantsy to science fiction. This story bringgs you into the world of what it is like to live in different cultures, it almost scares me. It was a beliveable book, as though you were walking behind him the whole way through Kumalos journey. If you like science fiction, and to enetr the world of others and thier cultures, then this is the book for you! Ashley"
1,poop,"This is the worst book ever written. im serious. It does not make sense, it is really boring. Nothing happens, there is so much unneccesary writting. The author could have written the same information on just 100 pages. Do not buy this book. you will regret it . I repeat, you will regret it. Do not waste your money this book. Please look at other books instead. The author has written the book in a really stupid way. like right at the beggining, the protagonist recieves a grave letter from johhannesburg. Then his wike asks him what they should do about it. Then the protagonist responds DO ABOUT WHAT? then his wife says the letter of course.When I read this, I thought, Damn this book sucks!DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,A WASTE OF TIME,"CRY BELOVED COUNTRY=BORING Out of a class of 30 students, not one person enjoyed reading it. It's boring topics and pointless characters made readers fall asleep. I am speaking for the majority of the world when I say this book is STUPID."
5,Sensibility and political accuracy,"Whenever we finish a great book we feel a deep sorrow,just as we were leaving behind good friends. When you finishthis specific book, you'll feel like crying, for the lossof friends like Rev. Kumalo is very hard to take.""Cry, the beloved country""is one of the best books I haveever read. You can feel the passion for South Africa thatMr. Paton felt, you will be touched by the Rev. Kumalo'ssearch, and will feel frail, just like he did.But that is not all this book has to offer. It is alsoan accusation agains the prepotent owners of the power andan accurate description of Apartheid long before it hasbecome legal.You will become involved with this story and will not beable to put this book down. If you want to read an excellentbook, pick this one and I can assure you will not be disapointed."
2,Boring,"I love literature and I hate to be politically incorrect. And perhaps I'm being unfair - I did read this a while ago and only because it was required reading in high school. But many classics and important novels are actually good! I'm being sarcastic, but the point is, that I remember this book as being unbearably slow and boring. Yes, boring! It was well writeen, and the dynamics of it were interesting and it did stick in mind for being a great view and exposure into another's life and culture and time. But it was slow and boring and uninvolving. The characters and the ""lyrical"" writing resulted in my feeling removed from it. Boring!"
2,Absolutely Overrated,"I have heard that this book was incredible in how it told the story of the conflict in South Africa, and the destruction the Apartheid brought into South Africa. The book turned out to be a symbolic piece of trash. The plot was so tedious it almost made me want to vomit. I thought character development was decent. You were able to see James Jarvis transform from an indoctrinated white man into an understanding one (much like his son). Overall, if you are really interested about the Apartheid, read an autobiography on Nelson Mandela rather than waste away 4 or 5 hours reading this tedium."
1,"Laborious, tedious, and poorly written!",I've put this book down so many times I can't count them....poorly written about a HUGELY important subject and country....a waste of time.
3,More Like A Field Goal,"An inoffensive and unadventurous offering. Reduces jazz to the level of background music. Pleasant to hear, but you often forget he's there. Consider punting this one out of bounds."
3,By taking 2 pills it gives me nightmares,"I can only take one, took 2 for 3-4 days and started to have nightmares.Also not sure about only one. For the last 3 night I have been waking up at 4:30 am and not being able to go back to sleep."
3,Lily's Crossing,"Lily starts out in the book feeling lonely and sad. The book takes place during world warII. Lily's father has to go to war, her friend Margaret is moving, and she lost her purse with all the money in it she had saved. Lily is afraid it will be a lonely summer until she meets Albert, and they become friends. Lily almost loses Albert's friendship when she tells lies. The book is about the importance of friendship and honesty. I enjoyed the book. It is was fun to read, but it is not one of my favorite books."
4,Good Book,"Lily's Crossing is a book about the effects on people during World War II. It makes you feel sorry for the main characters, as the deal with situations during the story. Lily, the main chatacter has a problem with lying, and a good friend of hers almost looses his life because of it. Then, her friend helps her overcome her problems. Read this book... and I'm sure you will enjoy it."
3,Lily's Crossing,"I would recommend Lily's Crossing to other readers because it is an interesting book, which describes the life of a young girl during World War II. What I liked about the genre of this book was even though it was fiction; it still had true facts about life during the war. Typically, girls would appreciate this book more because it is based on a young girl's life. In some parts of this novel I just could not put down the book because there was a cliffhanger at the end of a chapter. An example of a cliffhanger in this story is,"" She sat there a minute longer, her heart pounding, thinking that this was truly the worst lie she had ever told."" Lily's Crossing would be an educational and interesting book to choose."
4,Lily's Crossing,"The World War II is going on and Lily's life has changed. Her father is now going to the war and her best friend is moving. Lily thought that she was friendless until Albert,a refuge, came to live with her next door neighbor. They join together in a special friendship and has told each other their secrets. They found out that they both have to lies. Lily told one that might cost Albert's life.I enjoyed reading this book, because it was a suspenseful backing to the story. Ms. Patricia Reilly Giff has a gift of bring a fictional girl into the World War II. She makes you feel the sadness of Lily, and the fear Lily has. As you get deeper in the book, you are part of Lily.My favorite part was when Albert moved in. At first, I was deeply hurt when her friend and father went away. When Albert moved in , there was a sudden spring of joy in this darkened story. As Albert said"",It's Lily,it's my best friend,Lily."""
5,Great,"This book is a great book, I loved it. It is a great book for children to read and use for reports, it is a great book."
5,Love In Spite of It All,Lily is a story about a hopeless romantic who loves her man in spite of everything he does to her. Love is truly blind in this novel.
4,Overwhelming for your average liberal arts major,"You need calculus to appreciate this one.But it is still very good. Like a dinner made by a top chef with the finest possible materials, it still may not be to your personal taste, no matter how well made it is. ""Games and Decisions"" is of limited utility for non-mathematicians, especially the attorneys and liberal arts majors that make decisions for nations.The maths are mostly over my head, and I was only really able to follow one out of four pages (on the average) of the book. Nevertheless, from what I could appreciate, I learned a lot about the nature of utility, reiterative games, non-zero sum games, conditions of certainty and uncertainty, etc, as well as a lot of 'special case' games in the appendices.I can see that this is the work of masters, but it is not something I can fully appreciate.E. M. Van Court"
4,Definite Satisfaction from the Boot Camp Clik Founders!!,"This is the album I've been waiting for!! Ha ha!! It's finally here!! And I love it!! Real beats, real rhymes, real skills!! We gotta push this to go gold! Platinum! Represent, true family!!"
3,"Catchy, but without soul","Bob James became the architect of 70s muzak jazz, helping to define the CTI easy-listening style. He did much to commercialise jazz, and his albums always feature technically adept performances.On this album, we have contributions from such leading lights as Steve Khan, Harvey Mason, Patti Austin, Marcus Miller and Randy Brecker. But James's style stifles the personality of his guest artists. The Rolling Stone Jazz Guide awards 'Hands Down' one star (out of a possible five), which is a little unfair.The stand-out tracks are the popcorn-like 'Spunky', and the fourth track 'Janus' (reminiscent of so many TV theme tunes). 'It's Only Me' isn't too bad as an early 80s synth demo, but has little other merit.For me, Bob James flourished in his partnership with Lee Ritenour on the Fourplay albums. Try them out."
1,Dull and flawed,"The message of this book, akin to Dorothy's final words in Oz to Glinda the good witch, is that the wealth you seek is right in your own backyard. This homily could be delivered in a single page and hardly merits even the relatively few pages of this work. The rest of the book is made of anecdotes of people who sold their farms to go seek diamonds or oil or the like, only to have the new owners find the very thing they were looking for, right on the farm they sold. Anecdotes are great for illustrating a point but are hardly firm foundation for making the point. He could just as well have written an alternate book full of anecdotes (of which history provides many) about people who sold their farms and went seeking elsewhere for riches and found them. What a con! It proves that all you have to do is pander to what people want to hear. It's a ""feel good"" book with a foundation of wet sand."
1,Lacking in detail,The book is billed as a guide to building a nature retreat. This is not a fair or accurate characterization of the subject matter of the book. There is almost no substantive information provided with regards to building codes or engineering. This book has some very primitive drawings that would only go so far as to enable an individual to make significant and serious errors in judgement in the design and construction of a cabin. It appears that the authors of this book have little if any experience in actually building or designing a structure.
2,Not what I expected,"Believe me, when I say is very primitive and limits you on what you can do and for what purpose you use it for. No layouts or plans or etc. Did ot help me much."
3,Think Twice ... It's JUST Alright,"I've always considered myself more of a dyed-in-the-wool pre-plugged-in Dylan fan. For instance, disc one of ""1966: Royal Albert Hall"" is probably my favorite CD of all time!Therefore, I was waiting at the door when the UPS guy got there with this CD.To my surprise, I believe it'll take a while for this CD to grow on me. I'm with the guy (see below) who described the Baez/Dylan duets as ""fingernails on a chalkboard."" Ouch!!Still, like the ""Judas"" cry on ""1966,"" certain parts of this set are like an awesome ride on a time machine -- for instance, CD one has [apparently] the first time a live audience ever heard, ""It'a Alright, Ma ..."" ..... he even forgets the words and stammers near the end.Overall, 3 stars. Sorry, Bobby."
5,dylan-5 stars a given,"The liner notes are terrible---cliches about Dylan, a grade school history lesson of 1964, and generally uninspiring, poor writing.Duets with Joan Baez are haunting, with their plaintive harmonies, that the uniitiated might dismiss as ""nails across a chalkboard.""Version of ""One Too Many Mornings"" is mocking and bold, rather than understated as on the studio version.""John Birch"" already included in Vol. 1.""Ma"" and ""Gates of Eden"" sound the same as on the studio album---absolutely mind blowing---yet nonetheless, the same."
3,Who's Joan Baez?,"Come on, enough with Joan Baez!! First on the Bootleg series vol 5 and now again! on 4 tracks??? I liked her, she is talented, but Bob is just on another level. Do you see the market flooded with live albums by Frank and Nancy Sinatra?? Of course not, because what people want to hear is just old blue eyes. Same thing here. Gee, why not releasing another concert where she did not show up? Its not like she was on every bill with Dylan throughout the 60 & 70's. What's next on the bootleg series? Joan secret visit during the basement tapes?"
4,Hidell Rocks....!!!!,"I have listened to this album. I love each tracks on this album. Their music sounds like The Moffatts but still different. Through Hidell debut album, Hidell succed to prove to the world that they're on their way to become a great band ever."
2,This is more of a general information book,This text is NOT for someone who wishes to gain detailed information on producing maple sugar.This text is written on a 6th grade level with basic information.There are more pictures than descriptive information.I do not recommend this book for someone who wants to learn details about maple sugar production.
3,Blowfish Live in the Sea,"Blowfish Live in the Sea was not especially one of the greater books that Paula Fox has written. Although descriptive and interesting, the book didn't really go anywhere... there was a simple plot: Ben's dad was a drunk, but he was still Ben's father. So, Carrie and Ben went all the way to Boston to meet a drunk liar... yet, somehow, they all enjoyed themselves."
5,Amazing concert DVD + the CD,"If you like Sade I so highly recommend this. This concert DVD is awesome, vocals and instruments and soul, and the filming of the concert is so great. Just a while ago saw Pearls and now going through Jezebel, one of my favorites ever, my jaw is on the floor, this is so beautiful from all possible angles, sound and visuals...Needless to say this package is such a great deal having this great concert DVD plus Lovers Rock CD. Highest recommendation possible."
3,Funky Favela,"I ordered this CD because I found it pretty difficult to get my hands on this type of music, whether it is called Favela, Carioca or Baile Funk.This CD is not bad at all and a few tracks on it are extremely good, but it is not a compilation of the best tunes out there, so don't expect to have a Favela-style party with 500 people shaking it up (in reality or just in your head) simply by throwing this CD on.This is a great album from which you can import about 5 to 7 really good songs into your media player and start practicing those derriere-shakin' moves."
4,Replaced with different brand,Company emailed me to say the brand I ordered was out of stock due to high demand. They asked if they could replace with another brand and send 3 cassettes. A bonus since I ordered 2 for my inconvenience. I ok'ed the order.
4,This recorder is exactly what I wanted,I am very pleased with this recorder. It is small enough to carry it in your bag and it records very well. I suggest it to anyone.
2,Received wrong size,"According to their measurements, I was supposed to get size E. They weren't comfortable, so I asked my chiropractor who suggested I get these. He stated that their measurements are wrong & that I should get size J or K. He had extras.I sent them back to the location that was included in the box, but I haven't received them. I'm hoping I get them shortly, but it's now been 3 weeks."
3,WalkFit,They are okay..Not as good as I expected from what I have seen on TV.They slip in my sneakers and when they do they hurt my feet.
5,Great Product,"I use them 2 years ago.Treadmill 5 miles run, play Squash and Soccer.Knee pain is gone. I recommended them to my brother for back pain."
2,get it free on google books,it's a 150 yr old book which can be downloaded for free from google books.
4,Best Xmas Gift 2008,"This was an unexpected, hidden gem of a gift. Great for a kids up to age 10 or so. Non-stop laughs. Before using it, I was worried that my kids would trip over it. No need to worry, it's flexible and durable enough that it stops at the slightest obstacle. Silly sound effects. Only downside is that it is a bit loud with no volume control."
3,"Okay, but way overrated by reviewers","Bought this for my nephew who is 2yrs old. It will not work on carpet very well at all. So unless you have hardwood or tile, don't even bother. It's not all that fun, and got very little use. IT's very basic, the arm spins in a circle, very very slowly. Not our thing, I guess."
5,Hoppin good fun,I just got this for my granddaughter's 4th birthday. What a hoot! Adults and kids alike were playing! This toy is good old fashioned fun! Even the 21 month-old played!
3,Fun for over 3 year olds,"My 2 and 4 year old loved this toy! It was the hit on Christmas morning, and very fun. Loved the activity, the jumping and the laughter. But as other reviewers have said, you need a large, flat, hard surface to play (carpet won't do), and you need to take some care with it. My 2 year old loved it so much that she dragged it with her all over the house and now it's broken. If it were only my 4 year old, I am sure we would still be hopping and ""getting stung by the bee"" every day."
5,What a RIOT!,"I got this for my three nieces, ages 3 - 5 and they went CRAZY over it! My sister really wanted me to get them a gift that didn't require batteries, but it's so fun to watch it's well worth it. It's a very simple game, just jump over the stick when it comes by, which may sound a little stupid, but the kids have so much fun doing it and as it goes around it plays ""Flight of the Bumblebee"". I highly recommend it for any little kids."
5,Fantastic Toy!,"This is one of the best and most played with toys I have ever bought for my kids. I bought it for my two-year old but my six-year old loves it too. I would, and have, recommended this toy to others. If it was made in the U.S.A. it would be perfect!"
4,"hop, chase, jump","My 2 boys (3 and 5) jump over it, chase it, kick it, put action guys on it and use it as a motorcycle. It's all sorts of fun."
3,Good Info salted with liberal bias,It is a good descriptive book on the subject but it is salted with a politically liberal bias. As are all Berne's writings.
3,OK,This book would be better for a psychologist. I didn't feel that it was helpful to me as an average reader.
2,It's alright,"I like the theory of parent, adult, and child...But how do you explain when the adult/parent becomes a child??"
2,Sound is too Tinny--not clear--skip it!!!,"This live 2 cd set of a concert in Winterland in San Francisco 1972 is ok at best!! No linear notes and the picture of the band is not accurate. Misleading. It does not show Papa John (electric Violin) who is on most of the tracks but it does show Marty Balin but he is on only one track. Very misleading when there is no linear notes to explain the band members. What is the Airplane without Marty Balin with his lead vocals and harmonizing with other members including Grace Slick. In addition, the sound is very tinny and not clear most of the time. Airplane fans--there are alot of other live Airplane cds out there that are a hell of a lot better than this one. Skip it!!! The price is too high anyway--I got mine for $10 and I am going to sell mine back."
4,good craft!,"My daughter makes very nice, usable potholders with these loops! These make great gifts! It is a challenging, yet doable craft for her at 9 yrs old."
2,Disappointed in colors and quantity of loops,"I think these ere overpriced for what we got, just enough loops to make two potholders."
4,Consistent Size,"These loops seem to be superior to what I had as a child. As a child, I found some loops in my bag to be too short to fit on my loom, and others I forced on there but worried my plastic loom would break. With these, however, my daughter didn't find any too short. I'd give them 4.5 stars because there were a few loops with strings, and one string seemed to want to unravel the loop when I pulled on it. However, I don't think the strings are going to affect the usefulness of the potholder."
2,not impressed..,the colors are not as bright as the picture. very faded. overpriced considering the flaws..
4,The need for more exciting organ literature,"There is no doubt in my mind that D. Higgs is a very capable organist, however I was expecting a bit more from this CD. This mammoth instrument never fails to satisfy because of its size and versatility. However, one fails to perceive the enormous space in which the instrument is situated. The mixture of substantial organ works with those of the more ""fluffy"" variety did not seem to work. The gradual crescendo to the end of the Bolcom fantasia highlights the vast resources of this instrument all to be crowned by a blare of trumpets with full organ tutti."
1,Don't Trust This Seller,I've worn L'eau D'Issey for Women By Issey Miyake for over 20 years. This product that arrived was NOT L'eau D'Issey. I would never recommend buying this product from this seller ever again.
3,Tony is alsways great but the material is old,"First I should say that I a huge Tony Robbins fan and that naturally that impacts my review.Sadly, the content of the DVD is the same material on keeping your body in neutral pH that was first published in Awaken the Giant Within. If you watch closely there are three very large prompters on the stage level facing Tony and for the most part he keeps staring at the prompters.That would be fine if he weren't teaching this for the last 25 years.I was hoping for new materials and was disappointed.The good side is that I can not afford the 1,000 dollar day seminars to his events so seeing him energize a large crowd was fun."
2,extremely boring,"In my opinion, the read is sooo painfully boring. Honestly, I had to read Riasanovsky's textbook in conjunction with this one and Riasanovsky's is so much easier to read and understand. This textbook, sort of has all kinds of different exerts and all of them boring, almost as if that was Craft's criteria to publish them in this textbook. Every single time I began to read this textbook, I found myself asleep. It became my sleeping pill, as it, sure, does beat insomnia."
5,Five Crowns,Our family loves this game. Even my 6 & 7-year-old nephews like to play. I bought several sets to give as gifts so that we can play at more homes!
5,Gin Rummy lovers will enjoy this game,"This is a great party game. As a gin rummy player, I found it very easy to learn. If having to read a whole book of rules keeps you from buying games, you won't have that problem with this one. I also like the fact that it can be played with 2 or many players. Young and old will enjoy it. Both have a good chance of winning. Great family and friends game. Can be played in a reasonable amount of time."
4,Enjoyable family game,"I just wanted to chime in with all the other positive reviews and say how much our family loves this game! We love card games, in general, and this classic game does not disappoint!As with many card games, there isn't a whole lot of skill involved. You still have to think about your strategy, but it really does come down to the luck of the draw. It can also be quite a long game, so make sure you have plenty of time set aside!It's fun to catch people when they forget which cards are wild (the number changes with each hand). Keeping score is a fun part, too, since the numbers can get ridiculously high in just a few hands!Overall, this game is really fun for the family!"
5,"Great fun and enjoyment,","Thus card is not only fun for the young but also fun for the young at heart. There is a group of senior citizens that play this game at least 5 to 6 times a week. We all enjoy it very much. We also play Euchre, bowl and play bingo.Thanks for a cool game."
4,Fun for feebul mind,Love playing this game! I'm a senior citizen and think playing everyday help keeps mind active! Kind of like taking my brain to the gym!
4,Five Crowns is fun,"A lot of people can join in the fun - I played six handed and everyone seemed to enjoy it and it lasted about an hour or so. The color suits: blue for diamonds; green for clubs - seem to ""make sense"" - very fun and you can play other games with the card decks - it is made up of 2 card decks - it is lacking aces and deuces, but you don't seem to miss them."
4,"A fun game, easy to learn, easy to play, but each game is unique.","This game is very much like Rummy. Each time you play, the game is different. I wish the cards were more durable, like Bicycle cards are. But overall the game is fun with two people or more. Each hand is different and you can never really predict who will win until the end. I like it. Not as much as I love Cribbage but still fun."
5,If You Love Card Games You Will Love This,My husband and I bought this game to take on our holiday trip to see my family. We love this card game and if you are a card game person you should add this to your list!
5,Best card game ever.,We have played this game with adults and children alike. Great for families. Teaches children some math as well when they have to add up their scores.
4,Excellent Game,"We bought this game, because of the company that makes it. While it is not as good as QUIDDLER orSET Gameit is still a great game. We have enjoyed playing this as well as teaching it to our friends that come over. If you have the other two games and like them I would definitely recommend getting this one. If you don't have the other games you should check them out too."
1,Fun,This is a very fun game.I would recommend this game to anyone that likes cards. We play it with the max people or the minimum and have fun either way.
5,Fun & games,"I ordered this game after playing in Florida. My sister and I play every day. It is a great game, and lots of fun!"
3,Love the game BUT,Love this card game BUT after a few games the corners are bent and splitting and then they come off. I expect more for $12.00 a game!I have tried to contact SET Ind but am having a difficult time doing so.
4,fun family game,Easy to learn card game fun for a variety of ages. Similiar to phase 10 but the game goes quicker. My 7 & 9 year olds can play this with their grandparents
1,Disappointed,"Beware for those of you Rumi fans who thought this book was going to be an updated edition of the old one. It's not! It is really a sequel by Michael Brown to the original and after the inspired collaboration of him and Barks produced the first Illumination-there is no way to follow it that could come close to the enlightened selection of poems, set in perfect sequence and illustrated profoundly by Green. Just buy a second copy of the first book and forget about this one. The best intentions perhaps but...forgetaboutit!!"
2,Thought it was new?,"Yeah purchased this cd from you, and when I took the plastic off, everything looked good until I opened the cd and it fell apart. The cd is fine, no scratches, but the case just fell apart and has cracks everywhere, and now I cant open it without it departing into two pieces. poor...won't be buying from VIP MUSIC again!!"
1,Way outdated,"One of the sad truisms about historical writings is that they are constantly in a state of flux. New archeological evidence and increased sources make the most recent editions and writings of a history ESSENTIAL to its most accurate understanding.That being said, this has a foreword by Teddy Roosevelt... I enjoyed this as I was reading it, but as I further researched the Mongols (as I'm obsessed with Ghengis), I came to find that this text was extremely inaccurate. A glaring example is when this text attributes to Ghengis the act of boiling alive over 70 men of his enemy. More recent writings attribute this vile act to Ghengis' ENEMY directed at Ghengis. Kinda important... Please get a more recent text."
3,puh-leese,"I'm no great fan of Bill O'Reilly, although he does manage to get some interesting guests on his show. (If only he'd let them speak!) But this book is one long case of a strawman argument. For example, by saying that O'Reilly is wrong about U.S. foreign aid by citing PER CAPITA giving is a classic case of making statistics say what you want to. Here's a clue: take a large nation and your per capita ANYTHING is going to be small. O'Reilly is right, though, in saying in absolute amounts in both monetary and nonmonetary aid the U.S. is by far No. 1.And O'Reilly makes no secret of the fact that he offers opinioin on his show. Opinion is not spin. Spin is taking the obvious and trying to make it something else.Still, some interesting points here that would be good to help deflate yet another gaseous bubble."
2,BLAH,"They may have thought to win back some fans by tricking them into believing Helldorado was like the old stuff they put out, but I was unimpressed. It is a very weak album and their worst to date. The music is similar to the early years but the singing is not and the lyrics are crap for most of the songs. A large disappointment from a long-time fan."
3,Old W.A.S.P. Not As Fun As It Used To Be.,"I'm a big W.A.S.P. fan and have been for many years, but this CD's a little bit of a let down.I am really happy to see the boys back with a some new material and with Chris Holmes yet!But I really liked the direction they were heading with each album and now they've returned to their so called 'demo' days and have songs on this CD that reflect that.As a advid follower of Blackie's Crimson Idol, and having loved the W.A.S.P. cd The Headless Children, I was really hoping for much more.Good party tunes, but nothing I can sit back and enjoy like those previous CDs."
3,Not as fun as we thought,Our adult friends LOVE this game and encouraged me to buy it for my kids for Christmas. It has been played 2 times and that has been by me and a couple of my children. Our kids do not choose to play this game. It is great and gets you to thinking.
4,Great for younger kids too!,My almost 5 year old daughther has been playing this for the last year and loves it. It takes concentration and a lot of work but she can now entertain herself with the game. She is also starting to see more complicated patterns that I sometimes miss! Really a great game to acquire math skills.
4,card game,"very simple to play, but hard to master. it is a good game for two. up to four. it is much harder than it seems. it is a great game for the competitive, family or friends. cause it is hard to play and talk at the same time. if you are not out for blood then the game works too. but in our family, we play to win. fun game."
5,Fun game for your brain!,I was first introduced to this game about a year ago and I can't get enough of it! It's a great game to play at a party because it's easy to drop in and out of it. It's also a fun game to play solo. Great for all ages! A friend just told me that her school used this game to choose children for the gifted program in her elementary school.
5,Best card game ever.,I recently started bringing Set to my local favorite bar and its a big hit. Random people that come up to order a drink are intrigued and start playing. And the bartender is a natural.
4,good game,"When I first try to play it by myself,I find that it might be difficult for my 5 years old son.But I was wrong.My son loves it and he can quickly find the set,sometimes even more quickly than me.Overall I like this game.I think it is a good game which can make our brain think more and react more."
5,"""SET"" is the best game and enjoyed by my family!","SET is a great game. I am always looking for games that will challenge all players at the same time. With children, it sometimes gets boring to wait for their turn. This does not happen with SET. All players are searching for ""sets of three cards"" at the same time. A friend of mine has an educational game and bookstore. When she was approached to carry this title, she called me up and requested the kids and I play the game and let her know our thoughts. We loved it! Do not be amazed if your child beats you many times ~ as they have clear minds, which is necessary to be successful at SET. We have taken this game on many vacations, as well as played it on the front porch or kitchen table. You will love SET if you are a gamer. Enjoy!June 3, 2009; This game is still popular with my family. I have purchased many as gifts throughout the years. Keep enjoying!"
4,Terrific thinking game for spare time in the classroom!,"I teach students with emotional and behavior disorders. We regularly work on social and personal skills. SET reminds my students to think before they speak (saying ""SET"" without a set, just to beat someone else to it, costs a point!)and helps the more hyperactive student concentrate. It was also a fun game for my family."
4,A great piece of 80s thrash!,"I'm in the process of replacing many of my better LPs with CDs, and this is one of them.If you are into thrash you MUST have a decent number of Exodus CDs in your collection or your collection wont be complete. Their recent stuff is more complex and is excellent, but their 80's stuff is uncompromising, straight forward and as heavy as anything that was released at that time.This CD is excellent for its time. I'm a big fan of Souza's vocals; he is more along the Bon Scott (AC/DC) vocal range than the Metallica or Testament vocal sound. Production quality is OK, but could have been better.The tracks are all good (esp. Parasite, Deranged, Chemi-Kill) but if you need one reason to buy this CD then listen to 'Brain Dead'. Melodic, heavy, mosh-pit inspiring. A great and timeless piece of thrash which alone is worth the price of the CD."
2,If there's nothing else to watch............,"it's a tv movie budget with [...]. Male and female. Not real exciting, but watchable if you can't find something better. Low brow acting, low brow chills, low brow special effects. Nothing really zippy here."
5,Awesome--Includes everything!,"This set is fantastic! The book includes instructions on how to make the following types of cards: 2 types of flowers, square, origami, purse, caterpillar, and pop-up (and a few others). It also shows you how to make a small box with lid and 2 types of envelopes. Included in the kit are plastic templates for all of the cards and envelopes (9 or so). Then there are templates for several flowers and a wrap-around bow. Not to mention the measuring guide (8 x 12 inches), the scorer and folding tool in one, and the 12 pieces of 8 1/2 x 12 cardstock and 10 pieces of paper. The card ideas alone are wonderful (easy and pretty), but the templates put this set over the top. The only improvement I can suggest is that the plastic is really flexible. I wouldn't have minded paying a little more for slightly sturdier plastic, since I plan on using the templates a lot!"
5,Makes being a cardmaker easy!,"This book is sooo clear, direct and supplies you with all you need but a knife and scissors. (and glue) The ideas were all so easy once you cut the templates and having more than enough product to make one each of the items was a treat!"
2,bad choice,"this book comes with a kit thats not worth the price.it has templets that are more time consuming, you'd rather buy the quick and easy paper punches.this book is good for primary school children.not for somone who's looking at making serious cards.wat a waste of money."
1,Not worth and not useful,This book is not for advanced programmers. It gives an overview of the network device drivers. Lacks examples. Might be useful for beginners. Not worth of buying.
4,Excellent,"This is a comprehensive encyclopedia of needlepoint, embroidery, and cross-stitch stitches. Each stitch is shown from both the front and the back of the fabric. Color illustrations shown how to make the stitch, step-by-step, with brief directions included just beneath the illustration. This book also includes projects for each area, as well as a brief history of needlecraft and a listing of supplies and tools. Although the book is slightly oversized and a little difficult to handle, it is an excellent reference source and worth the extra effort."
3,needlework essential,The price was so right. I was interested in content onlyand didn't mind that the cover was not perfect because thatissue had already been covered in the description.
2,Beware the Undisclosed Full Screen,"Personal Services is brilliant, and as far as I know this is the only way to get it in the North American market. The second feature, Over Her Dead Body, isn't worth wasting a single-word review on. What was really disappointing about this product is the complete lack of forewarning that it is not presented in proper widescreen format. In an age when old-style square televisions are increasingly relegated to secondary use or recycle bins, full screen DVDs have little place. And unlabled full screen DVDs are completely unforgiveable."
2,Autocad for Architects,"Dissapointed! the book does not cover 3D commands, which are actually the main strength of Autocad 2007 version!.."
4,great stuff,"Really cool cymbal, its a good addition to my existing gear. Really short and crispy, great for Electronic music, but I'm sure you can find more ideas with this cool sound."
1,Kids didn't like at all,"My 2 boys, 2 and 3.5 years old didn't like these at all. They took stuff from the late 70's / early 80's for these dvd's. My 2 year old loves basically every dvd that has something to do with numbers or letters... but he never paid attention to these. So we gave these away after a couple weeks."
4,sure would love a new edition,"I just wanted to add my voice, if the authors are listening, that this book is a great resource and a new edition would be so welcome. Some of the info doesn't go out of date, of course, but there are so many new cultivars and plants that are more easily obtained than they were 20 years ago that would fit well into the home landscape and the permaculture view of gardening. I got this book at the library and i may buy a used copy, but I would jump at the chance of an updated edition!"
2,Poor Quality Net,Purchased this for my grand daughter for Christmas. The net broke immediately and 2 of the birdies broke to pieces after just one hit of the racket. Not worth the money I paid.
2,Too thin,"Compared to the other gig bags I own, this bag is very thin and floppy with virtually no padding to protect your guitar. I would recommend something with more padding."
4,"not that readable, a good reference","I read the previous review and borrowed this book from library. I am not from math/statistics, but I followed the construction of the stochastic integrals with respect to continuous semimartingales (from 'Diffusions, Markov Processes and Martingales') without difficult (well, somewhat, but not major). The thing is I found this book is not that easy to read, especially the part for general processes, i.e. predictable times, accessible times, predictable projections, etc. By browsing the book, I can only grasp the results they derive, but can't follow the details because of the heavy machinery. Nevertheless, this books contains full details, compared to 'Limit Theorems for Stochastic Processes' (I haven't read all, neither have I read C. Dellacherie and P. A. Meyer), and it suffices to be a good reference book."
5,Charles-Review,"It is a good book about a class visiting a post office, I go to my local post office quite frequently."
3,Useful but limited foldout guide.,"This is a useful guide for identifying common birds in Tennessee. However, it includes only the drawings and sizes. I use mind to hand to friends when I am birding; it keeps them out of my Peterson's and Audubon guides."
4,My 5 year old niece loves it!,"I had to help my niece with the first potholder but after that she was doing them an her own. She loves picking the colors and reminds herself ""over, under, over, under"". Great beginner craft for young kids."
4,Lancet & Extractor tool,"Quality designed product at a great price. Extractor hole should be larger, centering the hole over blemish is extremely difficult. Maybe the one I got wasn't drilled right."
3,it's OK I guess,"the hole is very small on this...making it hard to center over the blackhead. My son has large blackheads, so this isn't going to work very well for us I don't think"
3,extractor tool,"It does some of the job for you, but can't get rid of everything. It was a decent tool all in all."
4,night book,"I enjoyed this book because it really kept my interest the entire time. I'm really not much of a reader, but this book was well written and it really put you in the narrators shoes and kept my nose right in the book.I liked the book because it kept my attention. It wasn't action packed but it really was very graphic and painted quite a picture in my head of the holocaust.There really wasn't anything i didn't like about this book exept the fact that it was really sad.I couldn't say I would change any thing from this book, I couldn't do better myself.I think the purpose for Elie writing this book is to share his story and let people khow how it was for the Jews in Europe and what they had to go through.The part I will remember the most is the boy who got hung and didn't die right away and everyone had to look him in the face. Overall, this was quite a good, but very sad book"
5,It was a realistic and well wrote book.,"I throughly enjoyed Night. I appericate the fact that not all Holocaust victims are cheerful and happy they were left to live. He shows how such a horrible thing can affect us all. Elise Wiesel is a very brave man to write such personal thoughts and angers to the public. The book itself is well written, surprisingly so, since it was an autobiography and I doubt he thought he was going to be a writer when he was young. I recommend this book, but be warned, it isn't flowery at all. And Mr.Wiesel makes no attempt to hide just how bad it affected him."
4,Book order,"I ordered a book for Christmas. I was kept updated on the progress. I really didn't understand media mail shipping and when I asked the seller, he didn't really explain it. I was worried that I wouldn't get the book by Christmas but then the seller did upgrade to express shipping at no cost to me. Overall, my expreience was good."
4,Vivid and unforgettable,"A true account of a teenager's experience in the horrors of concentration camps, Night is both vivid and apalling. Elie Weisel isn't very wordy, instead, he uses base imagery to describe the nightmare of the Holocaust. In the beginning of the book, the Jews cling to optimism, even after being forewarned by one of their own. But as the story progresses, Elie loses his hope, his faith, almost his will to live. Only th presence of his father keeps Elie fighting for life. The most remarkable thing about Night is the way it shows everyones' different reactions to the concentration camps. This book exposes raw human nature, when humans are forced to face a horrifying ordeal. Night, despite its depressing topic, is a book that's hard to put down."
5,Night,The book is trilling and exciting and each time you stop reading it you want to read more of and keep going. I would recommend the book to people who want to read something catchy and powerful. The author's style of writing is so penetrating and piercing to your mind and soul.
5,Why?,"In Elie's time at the concentration camp he questions many things. He is constantly questioning why his people still praise and glofiy the same God who has betrayed them. Elie demands to know why God is punishing his people? But there is no end to the questioning of God's reasons, and there are only silent answers. Elies belief in his God waivers throughout the whole novel and eventually is destroyed. The Nazis not only murder his whole family but also his God. This was an insightful book full of pain, but extremely realistic. It makes you question the little things we take for granted, like our freedom."
2,"Interesting, but poor literary quality...","'Night' is a valuable resource in terms of being a first hand account of the Nazi concentration camp system. But as far a literary works go, this book certainly is nothing special. Weisel's attempts to inject the story with emotional descriptions (I am not suggesting his experiences were not gut-wrenching) turn out a bit lame, and it doesn't make for great reading. In a book so insubstantial (about 100 pages) something more needed to be done with the story to make it more captivating. Good for a history student, of little value to a bookworm."
5,"A ""Must-Read""","This books should be read by everyone. It describes the horrible experiences of jews in concentration camps. Every student should know about. Elie Wiesel is one of the lucky Holocause survivors, who has the courage to write about what happened to him. Breathtaking!"
5,"by far on of, if not THE best book i have ever read","I am a Teenager, 16 yrs old... I read this book in my English class. before I read it, I have never heard of Elie Wiesel or his story, but I couldn't be happier that I had a chance to read his work. This story opens your eyes. We have all heard stories of death camps, including those of our own families but Nothing i've ever heard touched me like this book has. It is one of the best written literature pieces of all time. I would recomend Everyone going through high school and everyone that hasn't read it yet to read it. unfortunatly people are dying. in 10-20 yrs just about all Holocaust survivors will pass on. WE cannot forget what has happend, literature is the only way to remember this horrible genocide. After reading this book NO one can say any word of denial about the Holocaust because they will see what really went on. If you truly want your eyes opened to the truth you must read this book"
3,A graphic portrayal of the holocaust,"Night was a very creative book. Its detail and characterization was easily defined within the first few chapters. Its graphic material was hard to swallow, but it brought out the holocausts horror and realization. This novel was written well and hopefully everyone can experience this novel."
4,It was a fabulous revivement of the holocaust.,"I really enjoyed reading Night. It helped me to understand what really happened during the Holocaust, and what it was like to see it from an inside view. The vivid descriptions of everything left a perfectly clear picture in my mind. When Elie described what he felt at the babies being used as targets, I could hardly let myself believe that it really happened. I will always remember Elie's experiences and the impact that it had upon me."
1,THE B.Q. Review,"NIGHT BOOK REVIEWI don't enjoy this book. I'm not really into reading. Too much death. But if you're into the holocaust and graphic descriptions of death and dying this book is for you! I don't recommend reading it. As far as first hand accounts of the holocaust come, I'm sure this is the best.-BQ"
5,An intimate look into the battle of a Holocaust survivor.,"I read this book in school twice, and recently read it again for my own purposes. Wiesel writes not as someone trying to sell a book, but as someone who was tortured and saw his own family, loved ones, and strangers die for their faiths, beliefs, politics, and heritages. As a young man, this tested and nearly destroyed his faith: A battle that many of us struggle with in lesser ways. Elie Wiesels 'Night' is not just a story, but an epic and a reminder of the extent of human cruelty and suffering. An excellent book, not for younger audiences (12+) but a crucial part of any education, school age or older."
4,incredible,This was amazing book. This book takes you on the journey of a Jewish boy during the Nazi reign. You may know the stories of the concentration camps but you really can't imagine what they felt like. I would recomend this book to any one.
4,review on Night and all about the holocaust,"This book is about a Jewish boy living during the holocaust and surviving it. He tells about his harsh experiences. It is so deep and tells just how the holocaust was. You learn how terribly scary and how hard they had to work just to survive. This book was very informative and enjoyable becuase it seemed so real. I really enjoyed it and would like for every one who does not know much about the holocaust and wants to know more, to read it. I definitely recommend it."
3,Night by Elie Wisel,I think the book Night is a pretty alright book but i wouldnt read it if were reading a book for fun since it is about people getting tortutered during the World War II. It tells about the author and how he was in a concenttration camp with his father and how he survived though the ordeal. This book shouold not be read by a little kid or it will give him a nightmare. It should be better for people that is older nad more mature and not a chilidsh person.
5,spectacular,"I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys realistic & intense true-life story telling. The accounts of what occured during this terrible chapter of the 20th century are depicted in both a shocking & fascinating manner. I found this story incredibly compelling as well as informative. Any person who respects good writing should find Wiesel's autobiographical portrayal of these events to be of interest, as it reflects each end of the spectrum of the Human experience in perfect contrast to one another. Anyone who doesn't, however, i would believe to have no sense of humanity nor care for their fellow man becasue they are too ignorant to concieve the possibility of anything such as this occuring within their own lifetime."
4,English Assignment,I think this book would be a good choice to read because it puts a slightly different perspective on the Halocaust. Elie Wiesel's account of this tragedy is more about the moral issues of the victims and of the feelings and thoughts that crossed their minds. The book does not talk as much about the unspeakable cruelty of World War II but more about the heart ache that went with it. The book is also good if you have not read any Halocaust survivor stories since it is rather short. It grabs your attention right away and does not let it go. You can get a better grip on what the Jews and many other minorities went through during this time. Which I think was the authors goal when he wrote this. He wanted to try and let the book identify with people as much as possible. It is very moving and you feel as if you are going through each struggle with this 15 year old.
3,Not that great!,"This was definetly not one of my favorite books. I kinda had to force myself to read it. I love learning about history, but I think I could of done somthing better with my time. I'm sure that not all opinions of this book are the same, but my opinion is not a good one.Sincerely,Chase : )"
5,Life Changing Book,This book by Elie Wiesel is one of the best books I've read. With the events that occurred during the holocaust it was full of details & extremely descriptive. After reading this book you'll learn about the holocaust that you never knew about & terrifying episodes will be playing in your head.
5,Why this book?,"It is true that anyone who didn't experience the holocaust will never be able to truly understand it. What people become when killed every way but physically, and what people become when given the power to kill without discression is of paramount importance for us to understand. Mr. Wiesel sheds light on the moving forces behind the people of the holocaust through his own experiences. This book gives a short lasting view of the horrors of the camp, but an unforgetable sense of the loss and tragedy suffered by everyone involved. I suggest you read it."
4,Lost in Translation,"The short novel Night has emotional power not only because of the dark subject matter, but because Elie Wiesel is a gifted writer who deftly reveals the spiritual and mental anguish of the main character. Generally considered autobiographical, the account follows a young man who feels he is losing not only God, but his humanity as the Nazi machine ravages Europe. The novel itself deserves 10 stars.However, the original translation deserves -1. Wiesel's skill as an author is blurred by a clumsy translation. The worst part is when the translator chose the lighthearted ""siesta"" as a description of Wiesel's first sleep in the labor camp. There is a much better translation out today by Marion Wiesel, and its worth the extra few dollars. This book is more than worth reading; buy the better translation, and you'll understand why Wiesel deserved not just the Nobel Peace Prize, but also the Literature Prize."
1,NOT PLEASED,"I was looking for a book re the habits, etc of the Canadian Geese. I was mislead, as the only thing i could find out about them was a line stating, the geese went south. That is where she wanted to go. Yje title and what was said mislead me. Not satisfied. Lamoine Dionne"
3,Some good NRG tracks,"This was a fairly good complilation of Hi-NRG disco classics. I liked ""High Energy"" and ""So Many Men"", but the rest of the collection was not that interesting."
1,"Werner 6006S Fiberglass Stepladder, 250 Pound Rated",Received Stepladder damadged. This was shiped this way as thepacking was intact and in good shape. Not worth the saveingwith the hasel of trying to get a exchange.
5,Steinbeck's Art,"It is surely a shame that Mr. Steinbeck forever will be confined to the archipelago of socio-economico-political literature. Too often a smug reviewer writes of Steinbeck's ""moving"" portrayal of the Joad family and their struggle against a growing America. ""Oh, how I can 'identify' with the Preacher!"" HUMBUG. Mr. Steinbeck wrote words, not ideas. His art is exquisite and melodious and stock-full of imagery. His structure, even in the volumunious Grapes, is compact and economical. His style, even in the scientific Log, is artistic and exact. And his ideas, even in the idea-ed Harvest, are irrelevant. Buy this book. But don't buy it because the blurb on the back says something about the Joads being an American archetype of the twentieth century; instead, buy it because it is literature - American literature - at its finest. Every sentence. Every word."
5,The Truth Is Powerful,"This is a wonderful DVD to show friends and family and older children at Christmas time. It gives awesome comparisons between Jesus the King and Herod the King, and how God's plan is fulfilled in the birth of our Savior. A great tool for teaching the true meaning of Christmas with historical locations and people."
1,DULL DULL DULL,This was the absolute worst book ever. I disliked it entirely through. Do not buy this unless you are into Chinese history!!!
2,i hate this book,"It totally sucked to me compared to <u> 7 Daughters 7 Sons</u>. Both of which my teacher made me read at school.One of the reasons was becuase this auther had absolutely NO idea about Chinese history, tradions and blah blah blah. One of the mistakes is that the Year of the Tiger and Ox are only One year apart so there was no way that they would be four years apart unless Malcolm Bosse has some dumb*ss to help him write this book.Another thing is how dumb this book is. Chen tries to seduce a girl and only think about them as well. He doesnt care for anything but his studies and even that isn't enough. When his brother is hurt badly he doesn't even seem to notice.He is so wierd and obviously out of touch with the world.The story is entirly for people who don't give a damn about what they're reading. So take it from me and all those other people. DONT EVEN TOUCH THIS BOOK"
1,Stay away from the director's cut,"Cinema Paradiso is one of my favorite movies ever. This review is about the director's cut, it just ruins the whole movie. If you loved the original movie, don't watch this new version.Cinema Paradiso is mainly a love story. But it's not about the relationship between Toto and Elena, it's about the relationship between Toto and Alfredo. The new version turns the whole move upside down. Not only the plot, but the characters too. Elena becomes the most important part of the story. And the character of Alfredo becomes a completely different person through the eyes of Toto. I don't want to give away anything about the ""new"" plot. But believe me, the director's cut and it's brand new 51 minutes changes the whole movie into -what a critic said, ""mundane soup opera."""
1,The never ending story,"What would possess a director to take his award winning film and add 51 meandering minutes to it? Ego? Greed? I bought this edition because I thought it included both the old and new versions (the jacket is a bit misleading...), I was sadly mistaken. By the end of this film I knew more about these people than my own family and I felt as if I'd been watching them in ""real time"". There were no thoughts left unspoken, no questions left unanswered, wrapped up nice and tight like an episode of ""Murder She Wrote"". I only hope that Quentin Tarentino doesn't decide to add an extra hour to ""Pulp Fiction"" to explain what was in the suitcase..."
5,Bravo...,"1990 Oscar winning film set in Sicily in the 40's and 50's. A famous film director (Toto) returns home to Sicily after staying away for 30 years. He reflects back on his childhood. As a young boy, Toto had a fascination with movies. Toto's Father is missing in Russia in World War and is never to return. A film projectionist takes the child under his wing and mentors him in film projection as well as life as he grows to be a man. He ultimately encourages Toto to continue his studies and leave Sicily ""forever"" so he can blossom. Story highlights the impact that films had on the community during this era - symbols of friendship, love, hope, dreams, a better life. The story line, the cinematography and the music are all first rate in this movie classic."
5,Watch the Original First,"""Cinema Paradiso"" as released over a dozen years ago in American theatres (and on VHS), and ""Cinema Paradiso -- The New Version"" on DVD, are very different movies, in my opinion. Fortunately both are included on the new DVD, so it's a great contribution to anyone's DVD library.I'm among those who feel the original was better, and so I urge you to watch the American theatrical release first. That's the one that got the Oscar. And that's the better work of art, IMHO. Nevertheless, the New Version will be irresistable to those who love the original, even though it may burst a few bubbles wisely left intact in the 1990 release."
2,Won't buy this,I had this movie on my wish list until I just checked the specifications and saw that it is dubbed. I want it in the original Italian with subtitles.
5,Just the best,This is my favorite film ever. Makes me cry tears of joy every time.You need to see this film
5,Cinematic perfection. A work of art.,"When this film debuted at Cannes, it received a standing ovation. Once you've seen it, you'll know why. It simply doesn't get any better than this. Three cheers for Toto and Fredo!"
2,Re-cut the director's cut!,"The original version of this movie is wonderful - hence the Academy Award. The ending is one of the truly sublime moments in cinematography! The director's cut adds so much melodrama, including footage which besmirches the main character much to the emotional detriment of the film. The result is a mediocre soap opera, and the ending of the movie is totally devoid of emotional punch because the whole arc of the story is ruined by the end of an extra hour's unnecessary footage.Fortunately, the DVD has both versions. Watch the original and love it. Ignore the director's cut."
5,Paradiso!,"I am happy with my recent purchase of a darling movie ""Cinema Paradiso"".I received exactly what I expected! Thanks"
3,A little overrated,"I see the appeal for film students: beautiful cinematography, camerawork paying homage to Hitchcock etc, and the subject matter is film itself.However the acting is generally overwrought and the film is a series of manipulative vignettes more than a coherent story. The love story comes in late and without much chemistry, so if you're expecting a romance you will be disappointed.Overall the story was interesting (I especially liked the anecdote about the soldier who fell in love with the King's daughter) and had a heartbreaking quality. But it also feels dated and ponderous.This review is based on the original 124 minute version. Maybe the romance is explored more in the longer version, but this might be stretching my attention span..."
5,This is the best movie ever!,"I saw ""Cinema Paradiso"" more than 30 times. Each time I cry like a baby and each time I like it more. It's the best film I ever saw and I'll be seeing it at least 30 more times. Don't miss it!"
5,Sentimental,"I first saw Cinema Paradiso in an empty college lecture hall, one of the only to show up for a class called Philosophy & Film. I had no expectations, but I did not think I'd be as tightly gripped and emotionally locked-in to this film-- nothing from it seems contrived or less than sincere. The most perfect description is 'Sentimental', in the best sense of the word. Like Duke Ellington is sentimental. And the original score will break your heart just two bars into it. Perfect.Speaking of: Charlie Haden and Pat Methany play the 2 beautiful themes of Cinema Paradiso on ""Beyond the Missouri Sky"" (Verve)."
5,happy child,This product made my son very happy. We can pick this book up at anytime and laugh and sing along. The pictures make my son laugh. I had forgotten how fun this song is and to see the pictures with song make it priceless for my son
5,You can't NOT like this album!!!!,"Alright, I heard Du Hast on MTV and I said, well, that's a cool song, but I don't know if I could take a whole album of it. I WAS WRONG. I saw Rammstein live before I bought Sehnsucht and after that show I couldn't buy the CD fast enough. The opening song makes you want to either go dancing or have sex and it just gets better from there. I love Kuss Mich and Eifersucht (the laughing at the end of the song is evil and fabulous), Buck Dich and Bestrafe Mich are songs you'll never be able to hear in English, but once you know what they're about, you'll never get 'em out of your head. This band is fabulous live and on the stereo. I really pity anyone that has to follow them."
2,Not good enough to spend 13.00 on,"Everything on SEHNSUCHT sounds the same: grinding guitars, lots of synthesizers, growled vocals in German (except for the last 2 tracks, which are English), and bizarre keyboards. With the exception of DU HAST, none of the ingredients truly jell."
4,very wierd,"yes they are a good band, but in the song ""Bueck Dich"" (the ue is used for the umlaut...you know the two dots...)it means bend over..the lyrics.""Das Gesicht Interessiert mich nicht"" means I am not interested in your face..(think about it..)....the song ""Bestrafe Mich"" means punsih me....find out why you should understand what you are listening to (bitte) The music is great but maybe learn some German first."
4,Solid,"""Sehnsucht"" marks the U.S. debut of the German alt/industrial/metal band Rammstein in all their flame spewing glory. When it debuted, ""Sehnsucht"" managed to go Gold thanks to the sonically hardcore metal guitar driven ""Du Hast"" which was actually a hit on MTV, but as the above Amazon review states, the best way to hear this band is live. Other standout tracks including ""Engel"", ""Tier"", and ""Buck Dich"" are instantly listenable and actually pretty catchy, and while I myself am a big Rammstein fan and enjoy this album, I could never get over the feeling of this band sounding exactly like one would imagine a German Ministry cover band. All in all, if you've never listened to Rammstein but like Ministry or better yey KMFDM, then you should definitely give this album a try."
5,Pure Heavy Metal,"Rammstein is as heavy as it gets. The only problem i have is that their beats are repetative, its the same thing over and over, also their dumer hardly does anything. But even with that Rammstein is still a powerful band. The fact that everything is in german just makes them seem better. I reccomend this to anyone who likes HEAVY Metal."
2,Nice sound but awfull lyrics,"I really like rammstein's sound, but because of the strange lyrics I dont listen to this CD very often. I have to say that I am German and so I am able to understand the songs. Its not that easy to scare me but I really dont appreciate songs about a father sleeping with his daughter (or a boy with his sister), a guy killing his love, or SM-relationships."
4,A true blend of techno and metal,"This one cd the will surely kick you in the arse. I can only understand a word here and there, but the musical talent of these guys does not need translation. This album bleeds talent. The cd sleeve is a bit shocking--but the contents are true genius."
2,Catchy.....but,"I give it two and a half stars. I'm not sure, for a little bit, this album soundz pretty good. There's heavy guitar riffs, vocals are powerful, but, somethings missing. I'm not exactly sure. The songs just get really annoying after a few plays on the cd player. Du hast is a catchy song, and I guess i got caught in it. There's power here, but originality and musicianship is lacking. They definately have potential, so, if you're a metallica fan or such, I suggest this, but, I would get other albums."
3,SUCHTS,"I think its really mean. I meam its so mean-spirited, it sounds like armagedon. Like tey wantto destroy everything. I cant speake german much but the lyrical contents sounds obsene. Sure its loud and metalstic, but so is a endloader. Thats what it reminds me of - work macines. ofcourse my boyfrien loves it. more than he lovs me."
2,"DIRTY, DIRTY, DIRTY, DIRTY!","As a student of German, I found the lyrics a novelty. Some of the songs are pretty catchy, but the actual lyrics are sick and make one want to vomit. Only buy this CD if you know no German, or never plan to learn the language."
5,The Awesome-ness that is Rammstein!,"I love the cd. It is in excellent condition and plays perfectly. My friends also think its awesome. I listen to it at school and nobody had heard anything but ""Du Hast"", so the sounds were abit of an eye opener for them. Thank you for this its an excellent product."
4,Very good music,"Rammstein has excellent guitars and synths. However, I do not know any German, so it is not as catchy for me. Du Hast is cool anyway, but you people who have the same problem as me should consider Anthrax. I do not have any of their cds yet but have listened to em here and am hoping to get their stuff soon. Anyway, Rammmstein is good."
1,BAD QUALITY - LEAKS and WORTHLESS,"I didn't listen to the people about poor quality. Bad decision on my part. I received it and it was leaking blue liquid all over the box and didn't work at all. It's not worth the hassle of returning, but it's trash and won't be the stocking stuffer I had planned. How disappointing! Learn from my mistake and know there's a risk of it arriving in useless condition."
4,"Sentimental value, good key chain","I never grew up with the Magic 8 ball and all its wisdom but some friends spoke of it. Fun anecdotes and messages, good key chain"
5,Take a Trip!,"My friends and I once took an entire roadtrip on advice from a Magic 8-Ball. ""Should we drive to New Orleans?"" elicited the answer ""Most Definitely"" from the mystical powers of chaos that control the twenty-sided oracle inside this little ball of wonder. You can use it to shed light on any indecisive moment, and it comes espcially in handy on a portable keyring.One hint - most of the answers it can supply are positive, so be sure to ask it leading questions in the appropriate direction! (If a little black ball of plastic can be such a powerful dispenser of karmic control, shouldn't we have a little say in the matter too?)Should you buy one for your next random event? ""My sources say yes!"""
1,DIDN'T GET IT,Iordered my book more than a month ago ( steps in composition) and my midterm examm is less than 2 weeks and I don't have my book yet!!
3,The Whys and Wherefores of Grappling,"This is one of the earlier books on grappling from the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu perspective. Renzo is one of the big name Gracies form the Gracie Barra school and an early Pride veteran. He is also cousin to Royce Gracie of UFC fame. And that is where this book leans. The combat applications of Jiu Jitsu.This is both a how-to guide and a snapshot of where Jiu Jitsu was in relation to MMA and self defence a few years back. The game has changed, but the book is still relevant. The book is largely about grappling against the striker, but includes enough striking work to show where jiu jitsu fits into the big picture."
3,Disappointing compared to the book by Clive Cussler,Raise the Titanic movie is disappointing when compared to the Clive Cussler book - which is great - like all Clive Cussler books!
5,An apocalyptic music proportions!!!,"Insanely fast, brutal thrash. In my opinion along with Slayer's ""Reign in Blood"", were the best thrash albums ever made. I forgot to include in my list Forbidden's ""Forbidden Evil"", these albums got the bests guitar work in the thrash scene."
3,Fairy Floss !!!,"This is pleasant piece of fluff as unsubstantial as a sweet meringue. Cleone, beautiful as only a Heyer heroine can be, has been loved by her neighbour Philip since childhood and is piqued to find herself taken for granted by this very decent but unpolished young man. She advises him to take himself off to gain a bit of charm and polish, but when he returns, painted, powdered and mincing in satins and lace and affecting a languid air, she realises that she prefers the honest young man to the fop that he seems to be. Of course it's all an act and true love wins out in the end."
5,La! so fun,This book is an older one written in a slightly different style where chapters are named and give a hint of what is to come. I found it fun. It is a bit of fluff but enjoyable fun light reading. A wonderful relaxation for a tired and hectic brain.
3,Fun and Entertaining Regency Romance,"Very fun and humorous regency romance story set in 18th Century England. The writing is as authentic as it comes (you will actually feel as your are reading an Austen or Bronte book) and the characters are interesting and witty. I very much liked Philip and Cleone's story and how their romance develops but while reading it, I was haunted by this question: why does Philip actually fall in love with Cleone? What is it about her that inspires him to make such a drastic change in himself and his lifestyle? By the end, I was still confused...Georgette Heyer is a master regency romance writer. If you are a fan of Austen and Bronte, then you will find yourself engrossed in her narrative of the time period's lifestyle and dialogues. Enjoy!**See all my reviews on my blog (sensibleromance.wordpress.com)"
2,not one of her best,"Mostly wanted to just leave a rating rather than a review.Looks like I am the odd man out here. I have read many GH books and, for me, despite the promising premise, this one was just not one of her better stories."
4,Solving Deer proplems,"Its an helpful little book if you desperately need help when your deer is in your garden.Unfortunately, the deer must the read this book too because a lot of the tips don't work quite well.I got this book also for a good friend for Christmas who had lots of deer problems in his garden this year. I hope it will give him some ideas for next year to solve his deer problems."
2,Barely passable,"While Phule has a habit of throwing money at a problem, it usually seems to be with more intelegance, and meaning then this book allowed for. In this case the money is spent and spent with none of the detail that made it interesting in prior books.So many characters that your favorites will barely appear, and new ones remain one dimensional. The side plot with the 'Rev' was simply annoying. The stupidity of the general outright dumb. And the fast wrap of plot lines unsatisfying.I didn't buy another book after this one. Asprin developed a promising series, but let it get trashed by a co-author. Read the first one, and the second if you like, but don't bother with this one."
1,I was disappointed.,"I had been eagerly awaiting this sequel and was very disappointed. No humour, scenes that seemed to serve no purpose, characterizations were wrong. My favorite character, Mother, was reduced to a dull personality. The impression I was left with is that Peter J. Heck wrote the story and Robert Asprin put his name on it. I will be very hesitant to purchase any of Asprin's books in the future."
3,It is ok,I enjoyed watching this anime. But I think it is a little expensive. You do get 6 episodes which is always a great thing and adds to the value. The animation itself is not too bad. It is not great but it certainly isn't trash. The technology in the show is pretty interesting as are some of the concepts. Unfortunatly the characters are a little weak as is the plot. It has it's moments of brilliance. But not enough of them. There are no extras on the DVD and the sound is ok and does not use the DVD's potential. Overall I thought it could have been alot better. It had the potential to be. Worth a rent to see if you like it before buying.
5,"Great animation, great story, need I say more","I saw first part of Iria on sci-fi channel the other night, I loved it. The movie mixes a great plot with fantastic animation. It's going in my anime collection."
4,You assimilated my brother!,"This is an anime flick in the style of Battle Angel and Cowboy Bebop. Iria is a cute young bounty hunter with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of tricky gadgets, Zeiram is a large, sinister, and apparently invincible being with a very nasty hat. Iria loses her brother, picks up a couple of unlikely sidekicks, and acts out a personal vendetta against Zeiram. The animation is fairly good, and the (often unlikely) story is fast-paced and entertaining. Don't expect a realistic tale, but do expect plenty of action with a minimum of drama."
2,Not really complete...,"The final evaluation of this DVD is that the story is not ""finished"", just like a first draft. With a bit more work and less ustilization of ""jumps into back episodes"" to reuse the animations and make some extra time, it would be much better."
3,Religion and Natural Law by C.F.Russell,"To tell the truth, with Christmas holidays and all the business, I have not even opened this book; in fact, I could not tell you where it is right now - probably with my supply of unused Christmas gifts I bought. I will find it and keep it for myself as I am interested in this."
5,Word Study Greek-English New Testament,"Eric Campbell recommended and I agree.Another great interlinear is Comfort's, that one is much more handy (small & compact) -- a nice little hard cover, great for quick reference.With McReynold's you get the most bang for your buck, but with comfort you get a more readable/understandable translation in a much more compact size.I would suggest getting both McReynold's and Comfort's......they work well together, and both choose many differnt words when translating the greek (it's nice to see the difference)Both really great resources for learning the NT Greek. I would also recommend Mounce's ""Basics of Biblical Greek Grammar"" and the workbook."
5,Great album!,The live stuff on the import makes this even better than expected but the album still stands the test of time regardless. Great remastering and cool album. Must-have for serious Riot fans and collectors of 80's era metal
1,Best to keep a dictionary close at hand,"I don't like this book as it didn't help me with my home work and Miss Rogers told me off. I wanted to correct my grammar which weren't very good but Derrida did not help me he was talking difficult stuff.While my grammar was attacked however, Miss Rogers did concede my principal point, which was that Derrida, having constructed his own metanarrative, is as susceptible to wilful misinterpretation through the prism of other metanarratives as he inflicts on others. Moreover, in some of Derrida's earlier essays, he specifically attacks Heidegger for misunderstanding what he means when accounting for his own form of deconstruction. Yet it seems to me - and surely to most? - that the central tenet of deconstruction is this: that authorial intent cannot be guaranteed as ultimate meaning; and that ultimate meaning does not exist. Vive la differance? Or does he need a kick up the arche?Miss Rogers gave me a B- for anyone interested."
1,Not available,I need to know the content of the CD to rate. I am a Pat Thomas fan but need to know what is on this CD.
3,"good, sturdy ladder; VERY heavy","This is a quality ladder, but it's VERY heavy - get aluminum if you want something lightweight and easy to carry around."
4,Amazon screwed me on this deal!,"The ladder seems fine, but I had it ordered, waited a month, and gave Amazon the okay that I was still interested, then got an order cancellation a day later. I complained to customer service, and they told me to re-order it and said they would cover shipping as as an apology for the wait and cancellation. I followed their instructions, but was still charged shipping, with no refund later. So, I got the ladder i wanted, but am annoyed to have had to pay over 30 bucks to ship it."
1,Better Deal at Home Depot,You can get this exact ladder at Home Depot for $69. Save yourself some money ($68!!!)and go to your local Home Depot. There are probably 3 with in10 miles of your house!
4,Cheaper at the store,"This is a great ladder, however, it is $20.00 cheaper at either Home Depot, or Lowes. I leave mine outside exposed to the elements....no problem."
1,Worked only two three times. Again needs to spend money to buy battery,"I brought this product and it worked only for 2 or 3 times. Now with full recharge, it can not hold charge only for 10 mins or so. I can not really use my camcorder with just 10 mins of battery . It's a waste of money. Thinking to buy a new battery again but this time probabely from a different place."
2,Butterfly Chair,"I didn't realize the chair I was purchasing would be so flimsy. I couldn't tell from the description or the picture. I was looking for a solid wrought iron chair, not a folding one. This one is not as stable or sturdy as I had hoped."
3,"A solid, well-balanced history of the Eastern Cherokee","Histories of 20th century Indian communities are rare. Americans still tend to think of Indian communities as living in the past. John Finger gives us a sympathetic and engaging history of the Eastern Cherokee tribe in since 1900. The Eastern Band of Cherokee managed to evade the Cherokee Trail of Tears and remained in their mountain homeland. Not as well known as the Western Cherokee, the smaller eastern tribe has a reservation bordering the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Western North Carolina. The Eastern Cherokee were benignly neglected by the Bureau of Indian Affairs for many years. Finger shows us how tribal leaders took advantage of this neglect to carve out self-determination for their tribe long before the concept became the guiding light of modern federal Indian policy. The book is useful for any student of 20th century tribal life. It also works well in college classes in Indian history or ethnohistory."
3,Expected More,"Long anticipated, lotta hoopla from David Foster promising even a much better release then his 1st and follow up cd's. Best thing (for me) is his duet on ""quando quando"" The album is quite good and well put together but still lacks that special sound he managed to capture with his 1st release. This one is simply just a nice record, something you would listen to during a small diner party, as background music. But, to say exceptional, not this one. Perhaps his next release. A dvd release of the UK concert would be nice (he included some of these songs on it). Seeing it would add that special ""punch"" to it. Oh well. I purchased the special edition, I've heard better rendations of Mack the Knife"" by others. I do not understand why the 2 bonus songs were not included with the regular release as these 2 rendations, really, are not that special and do not warrant the extra pricing."
2,Not bad for the virgin ear i guess . . .,"if youre lookin for pure atmosphere, this cd is fine as backdrop.AS far as a vocalist, he has listened to entirely too much Connick Jr [who is incidentally the largest Sinatra wanna-be on the planet]... and radiates of the sound...I would reccomend this cd for those not familiar with jazz classics as a way to ease into them, but once you hear the true masters sing these songs [as ALL the greats have] you most likely will never let this sound in again....I will say i enjoyed a few tracks [his original and the duet], however, this is anything but timeless......Its nice music, and in nice, i mean its sung in key and tempo, but it lacks all the lustre and emotion that any of you who love jazz seek in music....he hasnt found his way, and the fluctuation of sounds heard in this collection reflects it..."
1,Oh so gay!,"Milksops shouldn't try to sound like Rat-packers!This is the most harmless and dullest album I've heard for a long time. Michael Bublé is a nice boy singing nice songs - its all so nice! The problem is that this stuff just doesn't sound convincing unless it is sung by a hard-drinking, hard-womanising wise guy who has lived a little!However, this album does have the G Factor going for it - Gays, Grannies and [young] Girls will buy it. So there is a market for this sugary stuff. As for everyone else, why settle with this faux-Rat-Packer when there are so many good recordings made by the real thing - i.e. Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr.Nice try, Bubbles! Better luck next time."
1,would have been great,"this is an excellent series and i was ready to buy it however, it comes with NO closed captioning, or subtitles. So anyone that is deaf I guess you should go watch something on HBO instead...."
2,A Big Disappoinment!,"...I can't listen to this album many times because there are so many awful songs. An opening track is instrumental song, which tells you a lot of this album. Arena, Bella Nova, Never and Falling are something horrible what I couldn't believe in Asia ever make. Arena is Asia's worst album! There are only a few good songs etc. The Day Before The War and Heaven. Asia has lost its creative powers and Downes/Payne has made something what I couldn't wait in Wildest Dreams. Forget this album."
5,Rubbermaid kitchen rack,Exactly what I was looking for. I could not find it anywhere but on the net. Very good item.
2,1001 ways to market your books,I have been reading this book some of the points that the author makes are usable. I was not impressed with this book.
5,Great Resource,"I am so glad that I didn't review this book three years ago when I bought the book. I simply didn't understand the publishing industry well enough to appreciate the information in this book. Of course the advice in this book applies to marketing and selling print books, but this is a valuable book to have in your library nonetheless. Anyone who's serious about starting their own publishing company must read this book to better understand book distribution, because without it you won't sell books (at least on the print side)."
2,In need of a serious update,"There's some good information in here, but it's remarkably basic to anyone with a little bit of experience. Some of it seems to have been written pre-Bookscan, though, even though there was an ostensible ""update"" in 2006, because much of the information is simply wrong and no longer the current practice on sales data and bestseller lists. There are better books out there, books that don't make you feel like you need to become a snake oil salesman to market a book."
5,Very helpful book!!,I am an author and this book is my guide. I use it all the time.There are so many different marketing ideas words can't describe.I have had great success with my book.John Kremer made my life alot simplier by giving me Ideas on how to reach my readers.I am so thankful.
3,Not all that great.... but I've read worse,I got this book becasue it was free and while it wasn't the worst book I've read it sure wasn't one of the better ones. I just couldn't get into the characters or the story.
