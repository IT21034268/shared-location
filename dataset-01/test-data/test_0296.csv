4,Great Movie!!,I loved this movie. Now I know some will say that it is unrealistic and all I can say is its a movie. If we wanted reality we would watch a documentary. This is pure entertainment. Watch for yourself and you decide.
1,boring,fake stupid boring been done 1000 times and these stories keep getting worse. This movie is painful to watch as the predictability agonises you from start to finish. I will say it again fake stupid boring.
5,Watch this movie.,This is such a great movie! I am glad I gave this a chance it will be one of my favorites. I can not say enough good things about this movie.
4,Very enjoyable,"This is a very enjoyable movie. The acting is excellent. The only problem I have is that the movie drags a little at times, but when the action picks up you are glued to the screen."
1,Watch Out!!!!!,"I had been taking this for about six month and was experiencing a little discomfort with urinary and bowel discharge. I went to see my doctor for a check up and she said stop taking it at once. I was talking to a friend that had the same experience. Is it helpful or not? Perhaps for some individuals, I have no more discomfort since I stopped taking it so for me that says something right there. I do use other Swanson products that I am totally happy with."
2,I wanna like it... but I just can't-,"I am a pretty big Bouncing Souls fan, I like the lead singers voice under most conditions, and I have all of there previous cds. But this one is just one big, mediocre song. The lead singer's voice can be cool if its in the right music, but on this cd is just sounds annoying. I guess the track ""The Something Special"" is pretty good, maybe worthy of giving this alum 2 stars instead of one, but probably not. I hope the Bouncing Souls go back to the fun punk of the self-titled and Hopeless Romantic."
4,It's a battery,What is there to say about a battery? It takes a charge and it delivers power. This particular model lasts a very long time. The impulse guns must not require much power to operate because these will drive several thousand nails before dying. My only complaint is that they are expensive compared to other batteries . At the same rate a 12v would be a hundred bucks.
3,Paslode Battery,Hard to find battery. Originally faily expensive replacement made possible at a resonable cost at Amazon.com
5,Hard to Flip.,"Great tube for adults. As a formal college football player, this tube is great for big monster bodies. My old college friends love it as well. I use to have a see doo hang on raft which you hung on for dear life and when u wiped out it felt like hitting a brick wall. This Mambo duo takes on wake like a champ, and when u go airborne it is one sweet rush because you feel safe about landing. My brother has the same raft as well, and we hooked both up side by side and had a TUBE WAR blast. I took this raft down south to lake Tillery NC, and I had nothing but people asking me on the sandbar where they could purchase this raft. It is also great for lounging on in the water....like a giant floating couch. It does take up some space though."
4,Works fine...packaging needs improvement,"Used these to construct some planter boxes made of 1/2"" cedar and the length was perfect for not penetrating through. Also used these to fasten 3/8"" underlayment to subfloor and after about 2000 staples, not one single jam.The only complaint is the packaging was insufficient. The staples are too loose in the box and all the handling broke quite a few of the strips. Not a big deal but still annoying to have to piece together a full strip. All they needed to do was stick a couple pieces of cardboard in the box as filler."
3,suprisingly good,"im one of those alternative type - ive never bought any cash money cd or anything like that... the cover art on this cd is misleading - cuz this actually a pretty solid cd - it suprised; he has a good flow and talent... id say this is slept on - i slept on it for quite awhile and didnt care; but now that i listened it through i have to give credit where its dueB.I.G., Da Hood, Show Rippa, No Sticks & Seeds are my favorite tracksPimp of the Year is a funny a** track even though its a skitI know you Freaky & Jeopary couldve been left out"
3,Fair effort,"The only good song on here is New Ballin World Order, however the rest of the album has a nice flow to it. There just isn't a lot of interest in it when you play the whole thing through completely. Nice effort but nothing special. Download it or borrow it, not worth buying out of the store."
3,Story should have focus on AG Gaston,"I was interested in the life and times of AG Gaston. AG Gaston laid the foundation for modern day black business people. This book focus on giving black history lessons, devoting inadequate time to Mr. Gaston life and business dealings. I was disappointed - I expected much more out of this book."
3,Cool Retro Stuff Lacks Script,"First, don't let the film format turn you off - this looks just like any sci-fi flick from the '50s. The 'bots are cool and there's lots of action (eventually...). The only problem is that there is so little script to work with. It's a shame, because the budget limitations don't interfere nearly as much. Also, notice in the extras how they set up their shoot in an un-air-conditioned space during the summer! Let this be a lesson to aspiring directors - you have to create a survivable work environment. Also, having a troupe of crew laughing like hyenas doesn't augur well from the directorial perspective. I still hope this director, or others, will encourage shooting on film in this inexpensive and visually cool way. Meanwhile, you can surely enjoy a viewing of this little film, it's still fun and different from most other things out these days. It'll tide you over until somebody rereleases Gog And Magog."
5,Much welcome mistletoe madness...!,"A great, groovy, well-produced and really good-natured set of original roots-blues holiday tunes... Acoustic roots showman Dan Hicks and a bunch of his Bay Area buddies cruise through their fourth album of madcap holiday novelty songs... and it may be their best one yet! The album kicks off with the off-color ""Santa Lost A Ho"" then zips through a series of similarly silly, likeable novelty tunes. The players are cherry-picked from the ranks of overly-talented Northern California musicians -- mostly fellows whose names you wouldn't recognize, though roots divas Maria Muldaur and Angela Strehli drop in for a duet on ""Boogie Woogie Santa Claus"" and Norton Buffalo resurfaces for ""I Want A Hippopotamus For Christmas"" (don't play this song for your kids: they'll only get ideas!) Overall, this is a really fun album... If you want a little break from the saccharine blechiness that passes for yuletide cheer, then this is a disc that may make your holidays fun again...!)"
4,Off the beaten path,"For those of us that have heard Silent Night ad nauseam, this is a fun and fresh take on some holiday cheer."
5,good book,It was actually a birthday present for my mom so i did not read it but she said she loved it.
1,Religious book that doesn't state that,"I have nothing whatsoever against religion or religious persons - faith is a wonderful thing. However, this book is very religious - it's really aimed at those people who are practicing Christians and who may belong to a youth group or similar. As a resource for people who don't fit that description it is worthless as every page will refer back to using your (Christian) religious beliefs."
3,6 miles huh?,6 miles is not happening. Not three and not even 1 for me while inside my house and my wife in a car. Granted there is interference from the engine and my house but she didn't even get 1/2 mile away and the signal was gone. We use them in Lowes and Wal-Mart when we go our separate ways and they are fine but don't expect to talk at any distance. We did pick up a conversation from a fire truck in front of us once. There is an FCC statement about getting a license to use these and that is not realistic at all. They should not sell them for $20 as walkie talkies if you need a license.
3,Not all 'moveable' thermometers are created equal,"Despite what the description claims about this thermometer being removable, the first time I did so led to the liquid inside messing up and was unable to completely restick this back onto the side of my fish tank. One corner of this strip is now forever refusing to lay flat.I ended up getting a more accurate and harder to mess up laboratory thermometer for the same price this had cost me."
3,nice but not the best,I wanted a wrist watch which I could see the hands quickly but the glass makes me to look for the hands for a while. And also I wanted it to have a night light but I cannot see anything with the light on.Still i kept it as it was a good price.
5,Very good for the price,"It looks and functions very well. It has calender, timer, stopwatch etc. I really like this multi-functional still cheap watch a lot."
2,Not for me!,"I used to like Casio products until I wore this watch. I use it mainly for travel, and changing the time is just too difficult and time consuming. Only good thing about this product is it's looks."
4,A watch to give me the time,"Well, I wanted a watch that simple give me the hour, so my expectatives where not so high.The only thing that I can make an obserbation as bad is the light. Is so pour, that in complete darkness you can't see the actual hour, but despite that is a nice watch, you can have two separated hours (if you want) on the analogic and the digital watch.So the chronometer and the timer, are things that I like much, especially the timer."
2,Doesn't Work On DS,"There are so many third-party companies that have tried to offer products for the Nintendo DS that have been either a miss, or a dud as a accessory. That has been the case with Pelican products, most of their accessories don't work. The DS Lite Write & Protect Pack is a pair of stylus for the DS Lite that unfortunately wear out within a matter of time, and don't handle like the ones Nintendo makes. On top of that, if you have the original Nintendo DS, not DS Lite, they don't work either. I suggest you only get the Nintendo brand of stylus', because they are worth it in price and quality, not any other third-party brand.Price: C-Control: D-Overall: D 1/2-"
1,Handbook to Hell,"I urge caution in reading this book. While it offers a glimpse into the eating disordered mind, the book reads like a handbook to anorexia. I know I used it as one, and abused it as a source of inspiration to lose weight in order continue down a dangerous pathway. I definitely wouldn't recommend it as reading material for anyone (particularly pre/teenage girls). I wouldn't even recommend it to parents/loved ones of those struggling with eating disorders because the book's tone leave's little room for the hope that is necessary in order to recover from an eating disorder."
1,Disgust,"Dear Reader,If you are looking for a reason to justify the eating disorder culture, might I suggest you read ""The Best Little Girl in the World."" Not only does this book idolize anorexia but it is a shallow, vain look in futility at the depths and severity of anorexia nervosa. Still caught in the hell that is this disorder, I found this book insulting and quite revolting as a matter of fact. Amidst a world of thiness, appearance, and weight, verging on the brink of death I found this book justified my actions, even reinforcing my disorder. So if in fact you are elated with the concept of entering an eating disorder facility, with absolutely no freedom whatsoever, ""the Best Little Girl in the World"" is a choice novel to read."
1,Horrible,"This book got me started. I picked it up in the library and it triggered me even when I had no eating disorder. it helped me develop one. It became my trigger bible and taught me how to be sneaky. I also had a hard time believing in it's non-fiction because of the ending. She just snaps out of it? Like that? Sorry, if this book could get negatives, I'd stick it there. There is no telling how many girls-or boys- this book has damaged."
2,"GOOD BOOK, BUT GOOD FOR THE WRONG REASONS","I have read this book and yes, it is a great book, but one must use caution when reading it. When I read this book I was in the worst part of my struggle with anorexia, and while reading this book I became wrapped up in some sick competition with Kessa. I continued to use many of the tips i read in the book, along with my own tricks, until I ended up in the hospital. I strongly reccomend that NO ONE currently in treatment or suffering from an eating disorder read this book. Wait until you have reached a strong level of recovery before you read the book. In my opinion, this book is a VERY TRIGGERING book."
1,"Stereotypical, Self-Congratulatory TRIPE","Steven Levenkron's book ""The Best Little Girl in the World"" is ridiculous and stereotypical. All it does is present the perfect little white ballerina from a well-off family and belittle the class she 'represents'. Levenkron assumes the role of Kessa's terrific therapist but i think he needs therapy himself!This book is nothing but fuel for a dangerous obsession. As so many other reviewers have said, it GLORIFIES anorexia. The chants of ""Kessa, Kessa, Kessa"" give the reader a chance to develop an eating disorder themselves.The sequel to this book, ""Kessa"" is just as bad as this book. Unless you are VERY secure about your self-image, do NOT under any circumstances read this book! In fact, even if you are secure, don't read it. It's nothing but self-congratulatory TRIPE."
1,Fine..........If you're shallow,"I'm a nineth grader in a small town and am being told to read this book for my English class. My teacher spent valuable budget money on a class set of this junk and I'm severely appalled.First thing first, this book is hardly appropriate for a guy to read and is not school suitable, either. It also contains a good deal of profain language.It appears to have the capability of reverse physcology and is definately dangerous. If you're shallow enough to just take it with a grain of salt and only read enough to write the report....it's great, but if you read into it......it's just strange. It almost encourages anorexia nervosa. Definately plenty of stereotyping as well.Good punctuation, though....kudos to the editor.Verdict: Not Suitable for Teenage Girls, Guys of any Age, High School Students, and of-their-rocker English teachers.Anabelle W., Age 15"
3,TYPICAL,typical super psychiatrist swoops in to save the day. this book i enjoyed but it is predictable and old school. Anoretics want to be thin for many mental and physical reasons. Its not oh im going to look at a magazine and say oh im going to starve myself.
3,Average Joe...,"I don't write a whole lot of these reviews, but every now & then I'll read multiple reviews that overly pan or praise a recording and I'm compelled to respond. 'Got Any Gum?' is one of those albums. If my memory served me correctly I enjoyed the album and thought it was one of his better records of the 80's. After reading these reviews I went back and listened to the album, and still maintain that sentiment.Let's face it...anything Joe put out in the 80's never rated higher than 3 stars and the 90's was even worse. The usual Joe album contains 3 or 4 tracks that are really strong and the rest of the album is basically filler and this album is no exception. Yeah this album is a little on the over-produced/commercially assessable side, but so was 'The Confessor'.Highlights here include 'Fun', 'In My Car', & the title track 'Got Any Gum?'. The lowlights 'No Peace In The Jungle'. If you enjoy any of Joe's post Eagles fare you'll enjoy this album as well."
1,So SAD,"Ritchie Blackmore's fans should keep singing ""Still We're Sad"" because this is a shame... This music is just so mediocre, where is Blackmore's outstanding talent? Night's voice, that others swear is so angelical, is just soooooo cheesy and plain, nothing great there at all, comeon let's be honest. Well, if you really enjoy folk music I would very much recommend searching elsewhere, and if you really enjoy Blackmore's music I very much recommend sticking to his wonderful old stuff. I have no words to describe how I felt when I listened to this CD, just, not because I loved it but because I wanted to cry, being a fan of Mr. Blackmore's true talent. A shame. But truth is, this has been the golden egg for Ms. Night, who would have never made it on her own, and certainly we wouldn't be missing out anything... Gee, the corniest thing ever."
3,OMG this is sooo bad and good,I DONT HEAR MY FAVE MIL;KLAH GORDAN ON THIS I AM SOO ANGRY BUT THE REST IS GOOD BUT I GIVE IT ***1/2(3 STARS AND A HALF)
2,Stop the group songs please!,"This is by far the worst release of the American Idol group sings. The three songs range from decent to boring,with He Ain't Heavy, He's my Brother being the standout track. I'm a huge American Idol fan, but the finalists voices don't blend well together and they don't understand the concept of harmonizing making for an unpleasant listen. Only a few voices stand out from the group, such as Carrie, Bo, and Vonzell, other than that it's hard to tell who is who. Performing solo is much better suited for the majority of the idol wannabes, but when it comes to these group efforts, they all sound like amatuers."
2,Completely Bias,"I was really looking forward to listening to this but when i heard all three tracks, it basically is a single sung by Carrie Underwood, Vonzell Soloman, Constantine Moroulis, and Bo Bice, it completely disregards the rest of the 12. I gave the single two stars instead of one because they did give my favorite, Lindsey Cardinale, a solo in ""When You Tell Me That You Love Me,"" and I can at least be thankful for that. Overall:When You Tell Me That You Love Me 3/5He Aint Heavy, He's My Brother 1/5Everything Is Beautiful 2/5Overall I am dissapointed in this singleTy"
1,Unadulterated homophobia,"When he's not consorting with the leaders of Southern Poverty Law Center defined hate groups (like Peter LaBarbera of the preposterously named Americans for Truth about Homosexuality), the author is attacking people who are born gay and who choose a Christian lifestyle with his hate filled, fundamentalist point of view. Foster founded and runs an organization attacking gay Christians called Gay Christian Movement Watch ([...])."
4,My Kitties Love this!,They love it but still get hairballs unfortunately. So I also give them treats for reducing hairballs as well. Apparently it must taste good though.
5,Nothing better than Paslode nails !!,"Being a residential framing contractor, we go through a skid of nails (100 boxes) about every 2 months. I have tried a few other nails, generic, and Senco but have yet to find any nail that even comes close to the Paslode nails. Paslode has the best withdrawl resistance and the strips DO NOT come apart if they get wet. No mess, no fuss. I don't even waste my time with any other nails.Tim"
3,history of the conquest of mexico,"Im still working trhough itit is said to be an exellent source of info for the post conquest history of mexico, and it may be so, but the ancient english makes for heavy reading..."
5,For heavy commercial construction use,"I work with a company who employs over 100 union carpenters. We have used Paslode Air tools for the last 8 years with great reliability. The impulse framing nailer, however, certainly had its share of problems until Paslode came out with the improvements in last year,s model. The over-heating and freezing is no longer a problem. Paslode has made this product good enough for us to rely on everyday under extreme conditions. Keep in mind: this tool does require routine maintenance which takes very little time, but it must be done for the gun to function properly and last. Bottom line, if you are interested in an nail gun with convenience and reliability this really is the one. (I do not sell these things...they make us money.)"
5,Satisfied user,"What do you do when you need to build a 60' x 35' equipment shelter/barn and the nearest power is over a mile away? That's the problem I recently had and although I have two air nailers, the cost of buying a generator powerful enough to run my aircompressor was prohibitive. I solved the problem with purchasing a Dewalt 18 volt saw/drill kit and the Paslode nailer. All the tools together was cheaper than the generator and they worked great. Used over 10,000 nails with the Paslode nailer and never had one problem. Even if I had had air, this nailer was so much easier to use by not having to drag an air hose behind me when climbing around on the trusses. Since then, I have found several more places to use the nailer where there is no air supply. I love it!"
5,Fantastic,"I recently purchased one of these to frame my basement. Being that I live in a new development of homes and most of the basements aren't finished, my neighbors also anticipated getting some use out of too.It works like a charm. Never jammed, never misfired. Puts a nail wherever you want. It's not too heavy and can fit just about anywhere. We put up basically everything that can be framed with this nailer.I used Paslode's nails (which I'd read are much more reliable for use in this nailer). I don't know if that's what made things run so smoothly, but if so, they were worth every penny.I have to say that I never 'cleaned' it - I'd simply pop the battery out at the end of the day and leave it sitting right where we'd left off. This doesn't seem to have affected the performance at all...Quite honestly I don't think you can go wrong buying this. I've used it A LOT and am thoroughly happy with its performance."
2,Of limited use only.,"I see this tool as the potential ""cherry on top"" of an exhaustive tool collection. My co-worker bought the framer after owning the Impulse trim gun and we just spent the week rebuilding a huge dormer (900 sq feet of roof), putting the framer to the test. My gripes: it overheats, it requires frequent cleaning, it delivers a nail only 80% of the time, it's so precious (expensive) that you have to worry about its safety all the time, can't be used in dusty situations, no hose (so a drop can mean death, if from high enough). Basically this would be the last nail gun I would ever purchase, though if I had lots of spare cash and and a full stable of regular air guns I might just run out and get one for those short, punch-list, small repair type jobs. By the way, I love the Impulse trim gun, Paslode should have stopped there, I just don't think an Impulse framing gun is up to the challenge."
2,Dakota Alert,Not good at all. Doesn't have the range that it said.We have it on a tree right next to our driveway and itdoesn't pick up our car. Not happy at all.
2,50/50,"The motion detector goes off about 50% of the time when someone drives by. It also goes off about once or twice a day when absolutely nothing is moving. I would not buy it again, but I would possibly buy the underground one. I know there are other cheap motion sensors that work much better though."
2,range is a lie,They claim this will detect people out to 80' but its more like 30' if that!I was hoping for better range for the amount of money this cost.Im thinking of returning it but some protection is better then none so I willgive it a week and test again.
2,Doesn't fit the 580EXII as advertised.,I recently purchased the Omni bounce for EX430 and it fit perfectly. Then bought another for my 580EXII and it will not fit on flash at all without possibly damaging the flash. Still waiting on vendor to contact me after I sent communication through amazon contact vendor option. No word yet.
4,Whatever,"Well, it does the job. Is not as good as a white ceiling, but better than pointing straight to the people or using the silly mini white card that the canon 580ex II has.It fits so tight in the flash that every time I pulled out I'm afraid of braking the turning head mechanism. Be careful with that.Could be cheaper."
4,Doesn't get much use.,"Had this for several months now and I haven't found many uses for it. Also, mine is a bit too snug for the 580exII. It's sturdy and is undoubtedly better than having no diffuser at all."
5,Nice tight fit.,"Never falls off, has a nice snug fit. Worth the 10 dollars to me, because I have had mine for years and it is still looking ""like new"". I use it all the time, and have taken hundreds of thousands of photos with it, and it diffuses light perfectly. Great little item."
2,Does the job but $$$ for a piece of plastic,Does the job but $$$ for a piece of plastic. This is perhaps worth 5c in terms of plastic so why so exp? Hence 2stars
3,Nice Peace,"It is a nice peace and does the job, but makes my Canon 580ex II flash looks longer which doesnt fit into my current bag. I have to buy a bigger bag."
4,Softens the blow!,"This flash diffuser softens the blow. Not cheap for what you get but I don't have the plastic making molds to make my own. Anyway, it does what it is supposed to do and takes little room in your bag. Slide it in place and start shooting. It works for me."
5,Where's the DVD,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It is as good as ""Cool Hand Luck"" and ""The Sweet Hereafter."" It's hard to believe the DVD doesn't exist."
3,"Okay, but ""Missa"" was better...","I liked this CD, and it has it's moments. However, Missa was definitely better, I thought. Definitely more memorable than this latest installation from Barquee. If you like Barquee, you will probably enjoy this CD, but don't expect too much. After Missa, my expectations were too high going into The Sound of OM, so I have to admit to a little disappointment with this one."
1,Worthless,"This item came in a box that was about 3 ft x 4 ft with only a couple pieces of brown paper for packing. Needless to say, the squirrel was broken off the stake upon arrival. It seemed more of a hassle to return in that kind of package than it was worth. Tried to salvage by having it welded but the metal is too thin."
4,A Church That Can And Cannot Change: The Development of Catholic Moral Teaching,I thought the section on slavery was a little long and would like to have seen the last chapter added to with his thoughts on modern ethical issues. I will again review it with my thoughts but the author would have helped my thinking. Hopefully there will be another book!
3,ideal extra tracks,I am disappointed that they added these songs to the cd so late in the game. I have already bought the cd and I don't feel I should buy the cd again just to get one hit. They need to do a cd single for the people who have already purchase the cd.
2,not very appetizing,"I wish that these types of books would have some way of telling you what their authors personal fetishes are. While I'm very open minded, I'm personally not into anal sex, and this book was one long tribute to it. I don't mind reading it in my erotica, but I prefer it to play a much smaller part. I'm surprised the poor heroine could ever even sit down, because she was getting it back there constantly. I guess what bothered me was the complete focus on it, almost to the exclusion of any other sort of activity. The best erotic books, the ones I go back to again and again, have a lot of variety, something for every mood-meat and potatoes to barely legal wild stuff. However, if you really like to read about backdoor action, this would definitely be the book for you."
1,Historically confused?,"I wonder if Ms. Royal confuses the term geisha with tayu or oiran which mean courtesan. This whole plot that based on Annabel Smith who jumped overboard and stranded on feudal Japan and her master, a daimyo Nakano (strange enough he didn't have clan name though) was displeased with Annabel ""pillowing"" performance that he ordered Annabel to be trained as a geisha, seemed absurd to me.A geisha is an entertainer, not a sex performer contrary to popular opinion and stereotypes. Though geisha sometimes had sexual relationships with their clients, they were supposed to entertain primarily through their accomplishments.So, when Ms. Royal went to describe one of Annabel training was to give a perfect handjob, I laughed aloud. That's something new.This whole historical blunder could be avoided if Ms. Royal spent a little more time in research."
4,definitely worth buying.,"While not as good as eat em & smile, it has its high points. Of course there's the hit single just like paradise. Also includes great tracks like damn good & opening track knucklebones. Skyscraper didnt end up being as good or successful as the earlier eat em & smile album,but its worth the listen.You may like the tracks i did. You may find your own favorites."
5,Great little razor,"This is the second Revlon RV557 razor I've had. I accidently broke the first and was so happy to find a replacement. I've used many razors over the years and this one is comfortable to hold, easy to use and does a good job on both my legs and under arms."
1,Buy another brand,worst shaver ever. Won't hold a charge long enough to shave one leg. Pulls hair on legs instead of shaving them. Very uncomfortable. Cheaply made. Buy another brand.
4,Product is good,"The Panasonic and Revlon razors that I purchased work fine and the family members that I purchased them for are happy with the products, but I was not given the discount that was offered by acquiring a Amazon credit card."
3,"Pretty shoe, but runs big","My title sums it up -- these shoes are cute (nice design at the toe, kitten heel) but run big. I'm a size 8 and these are way too big for me... try a half size down if you want to buy them."
5,the best guitar CD I never listened in my life,Sometimes it's necessary to become in the past for knowing the real masters of music this is a great occasion to to it
3,KILL SWITCH,AN OK MOVIE OF STEVEN SEAGAL'S.BETTER THAN SOME NOT AS GOOD AS OTHERS. I AM A FAN SO WATCH ALL OF THEM
2,"EVERY BAND HAS A WORST ALBUM, INCLUDING THE RAMONES","As a huge Ramones fan, it is hard to admit that they even have a worst album. While there are a few good songs - ""I Wanna Live,"" ""Bop 'Til You Drop,"" and ""Garden of Serenity"" - it also has the worst song they ever recorded, ""I'm Not Jesus."" Most of the rest are just average. Die hard fans must have it in their collections, but others are advised to buy any of their other albums first."
4,"""Come on, take my hand...""","This is a fine Ramones album. Perhaps maybe not lyrically inspired in comparison to say, ""Too Tough to Die,"" but this album is definitely a good listen. A lot of the songs, such as ""Bop 'Til you Drop,"" ""Weasel Face,"" ""Go Lil Camaro Go"" and ""A Real Cool Time"" are pure and very catchy Ramones songs, to say nothing of ""I wanna Live"" and ""Garden of Serenity."" The highlight, what really makes the songs gel together very well, is the drumming of Richie Ramone; his unique style really stands out on this album, specifically in the aforementioned songs. Joey gives a great vocal performance, as usual, and the Dee Dee track ""I lost My Mind"" is good fun. You can't go wrong with Halfway to Sanity; you're in for a real cool time."
4,Altoids Ginger twelve pack,I really enjoyed that this product shipped in one day and arrived at the house in three. I really like the taste of ginger and I recommend it for anyone who wants an affordable product that helps with stomach ailments and tastes good. Four stars for this product
3,A Little too Sweet,"We have been big fans of these Altoids for a long time. They are a great breath freshener and cough suppressant. It makes a suitable replacement for preserved ginger candy. However, the old Altoids made in England were much better than the new ones made in the US. The English version was not as sweet and tasted more like real ginger. We still have some of the old version and the differences are very evident. Still, the new ones are the best mass produced mints out there in the market - and the only place we could find to buy them is through Amazon. They are not on retail racks."
5,Altoids Ginger Mints,My Mom Uses these for her nausea that comes from medication she takes for her heart.They work great.
4,I'm confused,"I think this would be a fun game, but I do not understand the instructions!! What are food tokens?? If you have the right about of spaces, can you go to the ATM?? I don't get it. Once I figure it out, i think I will love it!!"
4,A bit of nostaglia bought back to life .. and its still fun,"I remember having this game as a little girl of 7 or 8, back when it came with a purple box, people were just becoming familiar with debit cards, and the only person i knew with a cell phone was zack on saved by the bell(the stone age, i know). When I saw that MM had been re-released, I knew immediately that both of my older nieces (12 and 10 yrs old) would love it and will definitely be seeing it under the christmas tree. Be advised, if it is still similar to the game of yesteryear, it has small parts that very easily disappear, so do a head count before putting the game away. But all in all its a great game and will not turn your little girl into a shopoholic sycophant, but rather a very discerning shopper (plus its just fun!). Heck, I might even get one for myself- you know, for nostaglic reasons, of course."
4,fun game,"This game is fun. I think the age recommendation for it is accurate. Even though it is a shopping game, it is competitive enough that my husband enjoys an occasional game with the family. The only thing I dislike is the time it takes to set the game up and take it down. I wish there was a better way to do this."
5,A+,"Absolutely delightful. Clever and funny, and the pictures are ridiculous. Some of the best rhymes I've ever read out loud."
2,Unimpressed,"I own the original DVD and thought I would update to this 2nd version. A mistake. The quality of the DVD is poor in both video quality, menu quality, and it comes free of charge with some bugs. The explaination of the test paterns was better in the original, in fact, after attempting to use this DVD, I went back to the original to make sure I had not screwed things up too much.Bottom line - if you have access to the original buy it, borrow it... But if you do not, this one is better then nothing."
1,Did NOT come with Color Filters,"Unfortunately, this did NOT come with the color filters!We checked thoroughly in the case and literature several times, as well as the Amazon box, and it is simply missing.The calibration is the main purpose of purchasing this product, so therefore the video is useless to us.I see other reviewers did have the filters included, (which sound suspiciously chintzy anyway) so it must be a manufacturer's assembly ""quality control"" problem.Shabby product, and disappointing that we cannot feel confident that an exchange would give us a complete product.We hope a return will give us a FULL refund."
4,It works for me,"I like this coffeemaker. It keeps the coffee hot, brews when I tell it to, and the coffee tastes great. Ok, so every once in a blue moon it spills...so I take a paper towel and wipe it up. No big deal. Since it doesn't do that 99% of the time, I tend to think it's because I'm pouring it out too fast.I like it and I'd buy it again."
2,Dripping Drives Me Nutz!,"I agree with everything else which has been written about this misbegotten coffee maker, but I would like to report on one additional little quirk: it seems impossible to remove the pot to pour a cup of coffee without the basket dripping onto the burner, which necessitates wiping it with a cloth or paper towel before the pot can be replaced--unless one likes the sound of sizzling liquid trapped between the pot and the burner. In pouring coffee I always have my trusty paper towel at the ready, knowing that it will be needed as a part of the process. It's a bad coffee maker design, and I cannot understand why Mr. Coffee, with all of its experience, cannot put out a product at least as good as those it used to make."
3,Nice but...,"Although I get the occassional nail jam (and the gun is easy to clear), I find, especially in cold weather, the gun just loves to shoot two or three nails at a time. Which is a pain. But it has shot them consistently and well for a lot of jobs and seems in no desperate way to wish to continue doing so for a long time to come. I think coil nails are a pain, but this gun loads them easily. It also seems to respond very nicely to preesure changes and will handle typical ""abuse"" well. It feels good and balanced, is fairly light and works and works."
2,Mislabeled product,"I bought a Bostitch P6C-8 plier stapler together with these staples so that I could get started right away. The outer labeling on the box showed what I wanted: STCR5019-1/4 staples, the kind shown in the picture, 7/16"" wide with 1/4"" legs. Inside, though, were some admittedly very nice carpenters' finishing staples 1/4"" wide and 3/4"" long. There's no way these can fit into my stapler. So, I placed a new order for Bostitch staples, STCR5019-1/4. I liked the price of the B&C Eagle staples, and they seem a very good product, but still I need staples that work in my stapler. I can't re-order this mislabeled item only to hope for the best. And returning it will cost much of what I paid. I'll probably see what kind of deal I can find on a staple gun that uses them."
2,"Good Reference, Poor Order","I've owned this book for awhile, and don't find it any helpful. First, the author starts with advanced topics, then uses examples that take much longer than they need to be just to illustrate a point. I think it takes about 5 chapters before the PRINT function, one of the simplest and best to experiment with, is learned. This book is not for beginners,.... Otherwise... I can see why one of the other reviewers could not grasp it. I couldn't, even with some experience. But now I program in C++, and QBASIC is MUCH weaker."
4,Great toy!,"My lab mix loves this toy! after 6 months , she finally killed the squeeker today. I think the key is that it is big enough so that she can't really get too much in her mouth. I have never seen a squeeking toy last more than 6 minutes with her, let alone 6 months! She likes to carry it around and throw it up and try to catch it. The only down side is that it doesn't keep her attention for too awfully long. Overall, the best squeek toy we've found."
3,Cute Appliance,It wasn't as sturdy as I thought it should be. I don't expect it to last long with a toddler. The sound and lights I liked.
1,flimsy cheap toy,"I just bought this toy today and I'm returning it tomorrow. It is the cheapest-made toy I've ever encountered. As soon as I took it out of the box, I could tell right away I would end up regretting this purchase. The one I got came with a dust-buster, which is even worse than the vacuum. Yes, it makes a loud noise and the front lights up, but it scratches the wood floors and is difficult to push across carpet. The front panel has already fallen off, and the panel in front of the ""filter"" won't stay on. My son loves it, but for the money ($30!!), there has got to be a better made toy vacuum. One last thing....they should NOT advertise that it really works. I wasn't looking for a vacuum that sucks up dirt, but the box says it does, and it doesn't even come close. Unfortunately, at the store, there weren't any other real-looking vacuums to choose from. Does anyone know where I can get a good quality, fun vacuum??"
2,abbeythegreat,"My sister and I both purchased this vacuum for her little girl (3)and my little boy (2)because it looked so cute and what fun it would have been. Very Dissapointing. One, you would expect that it would do more. It does not role easily on carpet and it is not loud enough. Even for [$$], it was a waste of money and I wish that I would have bought one that was more realistic and had more lights. Also, it is hard to turn on and off."
5,TOY,A LITTLE PRICEY BUT IT DOES WORK ON LITTLE THINGS ON THE FLOOR . GRANDSON LOVES TO PLAY WITH IT.
3,Noise gets louder but it did what we needed it to,"Who thought it would be in the 90's 1.5 hours north of Toronto! While at a cottage this fan ran continually for the entire week. The fan developed an odd noise which got louder as the week progressed. The cause could have been the constant use or the sandy environment, I don't know. But even while making the noise it continued to work."
4,Ace spading fork,Received fork in 11/25/11 for my just started compost pile. Folk feels strong and should last for next 30 years if store indoor. Good buy at the price.
4,Works well,Yep it's a spading fork with a plastic handle. Works as I expected. I'm using it for aerating my mulch pile and have no concerns for the shaft braeaking.
4,Holds up to repeated listenings...,"I liked this more than I thought I would. I was very happy with the balance of prog and heavy sounds. These guys can really play, and it shows. It's very song oriented though, and that's a good thing because the songs are good. The vocals are unobjectionable (well,that means good considering they're from Sweden). I thought the guitar would be a bit better, it's good on average; kind of Uli Jon Roth 'light'. Johan is very talented & I hope to hear him develop more in the future into the monster that some of this material hints at...he's just not there yet in my opinion. This is still better than most prog currently out there, and not boring or tedious as so much of it ends up being."
4,Provides a clear understanding of selected equations,"I got this book with high expectations, and it turned out to be a good read for me. It introduced me to many basic scientific concepts that I have since then been able to learn much more about. As well as providing a basic understanding of the equations and the concepts, the essays, written by many different authors, still adventure into some interesting material. The book includes essays on Schrodinger's equation, Einstein's relativity, E = m c^2, the CFC problem, the Drake equation, and a few others. If you already have a vast knowledge of these equations and the concepts that accompany them, this book would be of no use to you (except for the Penrose essay...he's the master). For a person beginning to delve into these areas of study...buy this."
1,"dull, depressing and miserable","I feel sorry for Jason Becker, it must be awful being strcuk down like he was but I have to be honest about this record, I hate it. The songs are just yuck! They are dreary, depressing and miserable. I can't play this, it's not even music."
3,Certainly not what I was expecting.,"Oh well, there -ARE- some pretty cool tracks on here.Five tracks stood out for me:1. Primal2. Serrana (I -really- wanted to hear guitar on this one)3. Higher4. Blue5. End of the BeginningMichael Lee Firkins plays the guitar parts on End of the Beginning...his tone is just righteous. I don't think I've ever heard such a delicious syrupy guitar tone before.Jason says:""A percentage of my proceeds from this CD will go to the non-profit organization ALS Therapy Development Foundation"""
1,Tony,"This album is very disappointing. Being a big fan of guitar playing, I was expecting very much more. I was aware of Jason's illness but was expecting much more than the weird sounds that this album has to offer. I wouldn't even consider this a guitar album. More japanese sounding than anything else. I was hoping Marty Friedman would be able to play on the album. If you are looking for guitar licks and fast solos I guess listen to his earlier work on Cacophony or listen to Marty Friedman's work which I feel is much better and I can appreciate!"
5,Perfect for diabetics or low carb dieters,"This is an awesome product, even people who can't stand sugar free products have liked this mixer. Goes great as part of a cocktail or mixed with club soda."
2,"""Missed opportunity"" Box","Not worth the money. Beautifully put together box and book entices you, but the music quickly turns boring and repetitive. Missed opportunity for what is a great idea!!"
2,Poor quality control,"For this much money I would have expected a flawless product. In one of the corners, there was a hole in the porcelain - like a bubble burst during manufacturing. At first I thought it was a piece of dirt. What a pain, having to return it. If you buy one, wash it right away and inspect it carefully. Amazon was great - they shipped out the replacement the next day."
2,A Very Strange Read...,"I'm not a big fan of short stories as it is, but I love the era of the 40's and 50's. Seeing as how that's the era these women are from, I figured I really enjoy this. Well, I was wrong. The book focuses more on the women when their older...much older.But that wasn't why I didn't like this book. What I didn't like was the writing style. Not AT ALL. It was extremely choppy, and I found it to be difficult to follow in many places. And the women themselves...I just didn't care for them. They were a very weird bunch, and I thought they were a bit eccentric for no apparent reason.Overall, not a book I recommend. But as I said, I'm also not a big short story reader. I picked this up thinking I was in for some easy, light reading...but that wasn't the case. Hope you have better luck with it!"
1,Whoa Nelly...pee-yew,"I got this album for my mom, so I decided to give it a listen. What is all the hoopla? People get it together! This is not music! This sounds like my little brother tinkering with the keys! And that song ""Mother, I Miss You""? What the? You want to listen to a real piano man, stick with Billy or Elton! Not this frankenstien twit!"
4,This cable worked for me,It did the trick. Very happy with this perchase. Glad I bought it not that my sound works with every device.
4,high gain for low dollar,"needed a quick fix for my blueray audio, could not be happier! Awesome sound for pocket change price range.....thank you!"
2,Cake Mix Doctor MUCH Better!,"Many of these recipes are -follow the instructions on the box- and do something cute with the finished product: cut in pieces and make a bunny cake,a sailboat cake, a butterfly cake, a computer cake, etc., or add food coloring and make a rainbow cake. I was expecting more RECIPES."
5,Great for no fuss baking,I received this book as a gift and absolutely love it. It makes baking simple and uncomplicated. Baking from scratch is good for some but most of us do not have that kind of time. This book allows for great tasting and great looking desserts such that no one would guess you took a shortcut.
4,Very Nice DVD.,"Great band, and great music. This concert footage is very well filmed.......the only problem i have with it, is the fact that, since these guitar players tune down so far, (or perhaps the effect of using 7-stringers?) there is SO MUCH string slack noise! it causes certain parts to be nearly indecipherable. But as a whole, the band is quite tight. Drums are insanely good. Vocals are great, (Cristina Scabbia is the only actual ""Singer"" lol) and perhaps i hear the issue with the guitars, because im a guitarist? nice selection of tunes, and lots of interesting extras."
1,surprisingly let down,"I am a huge Lacuna Coil. I own all of their albums, so when I heard that they were making a DVD I was excited. I have never been let down by any of their work. So when i finally got it in the mail, I put it into my DVD player. I was shocked to see it was old footage of them playing (footage that can easily be found on youtube). I was hoping that they would put on a solo show specificly for the DVD, Lacuna Coil needs to take a page from the book of Within Temptation. The only thing that makes the DVD worth anything is the ""behind the scenes footage"" and the additional music videos for Karmacode. Otherwise Lacuna Coil needs more time working on their ""art"" than shameful self promoting"
2,Lacuna Lacking :(,"I'm a HUGE Lacuna Coil fan - HUGE. I was so excited at the prospect of a Lacuna Coil Dvd that I immediately bought it when it came out. Sadly this dvd completely disappoints. First of all the quality is pretty bad for a professional dvd - that in itself ruined the dvd for me. Second, there is not enough NON-concert footage...the footage from when they were in Japan SUCKED...they kept repeating the same boring images over and over. I've seen some pictures from Cristina's myspace about their time in Japan and it seemed more interesting then what this dvd portrayed. It would have been nice to see a ""home video"" of sorts with Lacuna Coil exploring Japan. Oh well. Honestly the only thing I did like about this dvd were the included music videos. There should be a ""do-over"" dvd made because this one failed. PS. Fans would have loved to see some older stuff too - especially older performances."
3,i dont care what you think this is what i think,i think this is a good laugh and it is good book to read.I loved the part when the bear put his head in the car that was also scary.i havent read the hole book but it is good so far a kid in my class dosen't like it
5,SO.FING.GOOD,"God I love this CD set. The Glimmers throw together a wonderful journey back and forth through disco, new wave, and electroclash. Excellent mix with plenty of speed changes and variance but all ultimately danceable. The TLP mix is my favorite hiphop adventure ever. TLP is a Belgian genius when it comes to making hip hop mixing work. He singlehandedly made me listen to more hip hop and almost like it, I never thought that was possible without a lobotomy. No big tricks in here on either mix - just excellent tracklists and smooth transistions. Both albums build and release tension well, as a mix should."
5,Complete success,"If you are tired of guidebooks whining about Scandinavia being expensive, this is your choice. The book quietly assumes that if you want to go to Scandinavia, you are aware that it is going to be more expensive than India. Do not worry, it is not written for millionaires but it does not discuss relative merits of garbage bin contents, either.Fodor's encourages you to travel to this wonderful country rather than tries to peddle doom and gloom message about ""clean, boring and expensive Scandinavia"", as opposed among some guidebooks who feel as if they HAD to cover the area but really hated doing it.Maps are very good, descriptions accurate and listings cover all you want to see there. I like my travel guides with pictures and these are in short supply there, but (as the previous reviewer rightly noted) the book is handy and light, and you do not want it thicker.A solid and well-researched publication, and good value for money."
1,A must have for the weak developer.,This book goes against all practical uses of .Net. If you want to know how to turn .Net into old COM then Juval is the man for you. I love .Net and all of the benefits of using it. Forget COM and let it die like all of the other dinosaur technolgies. All hail .Net.
5,Anything Gilmore is Great!,Anyway you can purchase the Gilmore Girls 7 seasons you should! They are a must have!
5,"""Gilmore Girls: The Complete 2nd Season""","I love this show. It is so funny and witty. The dialogue is excellent and the acting is so good. I love this show and can't wait to get this for christmas. Me and my sister got the 1st season and watched it all the way through! Great show that holds a special place in my life. Quite the show.Also watch:""C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation""""The O.C.""""The Nanny"" I wish this came out on DVD""Seinfeld"""
5,"Smart, funny, great","The second season of the show is more of the same perfection as the first. Storylines evolve, and this show demonstrates its smarts by playing out storylines over a season instead of over a couple of episodes."
1,"Mercury FREE, but virtually worthless....","In the previous review, the author is apparently unaware that the Merthiolate solution offered here is the new ""mercury free"" formula. This weak concoction is composed primarily of water, alcohol and acetone. Its effectiveness is one star above zero. The original tincture Merthiolate (thimerosal) formula, which contained trace levels of mercury, was discontinued years ago. Regardless of the controversy surrounding its content, the original formula was a very effective antiseptic and served well a large majority of people in my generation."
5,I'm listening to it now!,Great album. A real pleasure to listen to. Easy-going with lush arrangements and some personal material and comments by Brian on the songs and his thoughts. Rio Grande is a fantastic song that really showcases Brian's genius. The opening song Melt Away is one of the most beautiful songs ever written and is worth the price alone.
3,Unappologetic Techno Pop,"""Movement in Still Life"" is an exercise in music production. BT's reputation as a DJ is lackluster, but in the studio, he's attuned to his craft. The album succeeds in this regard."
4,Don't knock the slow stuff,"A couple of reviews here have knocked the ""ballads"" that are on this CD...while they are different from the rest of the music here, I think they're pretty good. This CD basically moves through three distinct styles, and does it very well. BT is stretching out a bit with this CD, and I'm glad to see it. Easily one of the best recordings I've gotten in the last year; I have everything he's done, and I can't wait for the next one. Local guy (for me) who's radically underappreciated in the US!"
5,Great Music,This is definitely BT's most consistent album to date. Outstanding songs and great production. Very melodic and moving without being cheesy in the slightest.
2,AWEFUL!!!!!,"This is the only BT CD that I have ever bought and it will be the last one I will buy from this DJ. He had like one descent song, and the rest was crap. He mixes too many things together and messes up the flow in just about every song. He also keeps on scratching and bringing in strange sounds and strange talking. When you listen to the first track on this CD you will understand what I mean by strange talking."
3,GET THE IMPORT!,"This US edition hardly measures up to BT's ORIGINAL UK RELEASE of this album, last November. Tracks are cut short to please American tastes, tracks are dropped, order is changed...what is truly a great album is reduced to cut and paste. Beginning with the great track (but bland opener) ""Mad Skillz/Mic Chekka,"" the order is insecure at the least. ""Mercury & Solace"" is reduced from around 7.42 to almost 5.00! Every other track follows suit.The import edition is a mixed disc (done through Pro Tools much in the same vein as PVD's latest ""Out There And Back""), representing a very musically mature BT. Breakbeats, hip-hop, trance all carry his mark of smoothness (yes, even the breakbeats!)...Transeau is one of the few electronic artists whose style is instantly recognisable (DJ John Kelley is another).In summary, ""Movement in Still Life"" is a truly wonderful album, but this watered down edition is not. Sorry."
3,Adequate of it's type - Enjoyable,"I've got pretty ecclectic tastes.. so when I heard ""Never gonna come back down"" on the radio I had to find out more about the artist. Mind you, I haven't heard his other stuff...but most of the CD was interesting to listen to. I'm going to try and find more material by him."
3,Makes me feel trendy for some reason,"The whold reason behind the purchase of this cd was my love of yoga. Odd, I know. I use MTV's Yoga DVD for several my sessions and during the cool down section, they play a really relaxing song. After further investigation I discovered BT did the soundtrack for the whole dvd, and the song I was craving to hear was called Satellite. The rest of the CD is pretty good, but it was worth the purchase just for that one song."
5,This cd absolutely rules,It is clear that this guy has tweaked every smallest bit of this cd. If you listen to this album over and over again you discover that all the musical layers blend together perfectly. And the voices are almost all edited and pitched and who knows what. Even though the really good songs are at the beginning of the CD it never gets bad though. And I think Mercury and Solace is the best trance-song ever. It is an amazing cd. I recommend not being sober when you listen to it. (And I am not talking about alcohol)
5,Excellent minimalist ambient electronica; not for beginners.,"Mika Vainio of Pan Sonic fame creates an ambient masterpiece with ""Onko."" Among the sounds contemplated in Onko's 4 lengthy tracks are static, rainfall, whalesong, fire, and breathing. Although the sound is completely electronic and minimal, often using only tiny bits of sound embedded in silence, Onko's sound evokes quiet contemplation of nature's storms."
3,I love John Eldredge writing but ...,This one had me going for half the book and then I just couldnt keep up with where he was going. In the early going I loved the book as I have with most of his books. I understand the spiritual context and the place desire holds but halfway through I found it redundant and lost the focus of the message. Maybe its me but this one didnt make it like his others.
1,Writing at its worst,"This book should be assigned in creative writing classes. Grammar errors, lifeless characters, stilted dialogue, misused adjectivies -- a case study on how NOT to write a novel."
2,TimePass,"The book has nothing special to offer. Its a quick and mindless read. I could not identify with the characters at all. The two female protagonists are way too silly and naive, given their respective ages. The male protagonist is unappealing from the beginning. The book left me feeling devoid of any new or fresh perspective. In brief, if your stuck in a coffee house and need to pass time without thinking too much, you can perhaps grab a copy."
3,it should change its book title.,"This book has a totally mismatched title comparing with its content. It is not a book about study skills at all, well, it has maybe only two chapters about studying in medicial school. The rest of the book talks about the british medical systems, and how students can do well in that particular structure.So it would be a total waste of time and money if you are a US medical student. The british system is entirely different. I read this book because I was curious about the british medical school system.I think that it would be best if the author change the book title to ""introduction of the british medical school system."" or something similar. It is definitely not a good book for you to learn study skills."
3,Diner Dash Fan,"I got this game to go with my new PSP for Christmas. I've already played all of the PC Diner Dash games and I love them. I also have the DS version, which is also cool. This game is fun just like the PC games. My only problem is the controls. I find it difficult, especially when you have alot of customers. I've only played this once, so maybe I'll get used to it the longer I play it. But right now I find the controls a little difficult. Otherwise, it's a good game."
2,this game is very difficult to play,i bought this game for my daughter and i tried to play it but it moves to fast and is really difficult to move things to where they need to go and you loose track of where the cursor is at it was more frustrating than it was fun kind of disapointed in it was hoping it would have been more like cake mania
5,great transaction,item came in perfect condition and fast. great price as well. will do business with again!
1,displeased,"I did not like it. It was not as I thought it was going to be, I thought it would give me a closer trim."
4,"Excellent, but not a classic","For me, four stars translates as ""excellent, but not a classic."" That said, if Lovesexy is not one of Prince's five best records, it is certainly a top-notch record and one that fans of Prince will be sure to enjoy. Indeed, in some respects, Lovesexy's position in the Prince catalogue is similar to that of With the Beatles for the Fabs. While both albums are consistent, hold together well, and boast few clunkers (Lovesexy, for its part, has no duds), neither album has a moment of pure transcendence that ranks with the artist's, say, top twenty songs.""Alphabet St."" was Lovesexy's lone hit and its single best track, but several other tracks also stand out: ""I Wish U Heaven"" (a pretty pop ballad), ""when 2 R in Love"" (a sinuous R&B slow jam), ""Glam Slam"" (dreamy, psychedlic pop), and ""Eye No"" (an infectious jam)."
4,"With a cover like this, it's got to be good.","""Lovesexy"" seemed to be less popular than the four albums that came before it, but I think it's every bit as good. The only hit was really ""Alphabet St."", which is actually one of my least favorite here. ""Glam Slam"" is the epitome of a great ""Prince"" song, and ""Dance On"" has the same energy. Two others that are wonderful are ""I Wish U Heaven"" and ""When 2 R In Love"", both awesome. But the best thing here for me by far is ""Anna Stesia"". It's easily one of my ten favorite songs from him, and that's saying alot when you think about it. The disc is also just on one track, so you can't skip any songs (as he intended). Overall, it's the last great album of his ""Purple Reign""."
5,Works as advertised,"I recently replaced an air/fuel sensor on my Sienna which was located on the front of the exhaust manifold. After spraying the old sensor with PB Blaster, I was able to loosen the sensor from the exhaust manifold without too much difficulty. One of the sockets in the set is fitted for a 1/2"" drive which came in real handy. Do yourself a favor and buy this tool. You don't want to be trying to wrestle with an oxygen sensor using a regular wrench. You should also consider getting an oxygen sensor thread chaser to clean out the old threads which will make installing the new oxygen sensor that much easier."
2,Not Very Good...,"This book is very hard to read and understand. Its full of all kind of legal and technical stuff. It does have helpful information but I found another book here on Amazon that read better and was full of great useful information. The book is called An Educated Guide To Speeding Tickets How to Beat and Avoid them, the author is Richard Wallace, the book is great and I bought it here on Amazon. You should to if you get a speeding ticket and need to fight it. The book seems to work based on the other reviews I have seen. I have not used it to beat a ticket but will should I ever get stopped. The author used to be a cop to! Thats Cool! This, of course, is just my opinion. You decide."
5,Their Best,"Stacked Deck has been a favorite of mine since its release in the early '70's. Astounding country/rock in every sense--instrumentally, vocally, etc. Russel Smith is an outstanding vocalist and guitar works is fabulous. Unfortunately, Amazing Rhythm Aces didn't receive the acolades they deserved when this album was first released--they were too intelligent for mainstream country and too country for most mainstream (intelligent) rockers. That's all changed. I rate this and the Byrds Sweetheart of the Rodeo as the two best country/rock albums ever (and I'm a picky music fan).The other ARA cd's are all quality but none can compare with this gem. Don't hesitate--you will never regret getting your hands on this one!"
3,I would give this three and a half stars if I could,"THE BAD:First of all, there are indeed so many errors in this book, it is ludicrous. For example (page 75, number 4) , one script tells you to use ""gotoAndStop"" but then in the code it has written ""gotoAndPlay"". If you type in the code as given, the movie doesn't work properly, but if you then figure out that the author really _meant_ to put in the code what he intially said - ie: ""gotoAndStop"" - the movie works fine. It's that kind of thing that can really drive you nuts.THE GOOD:That said, I did learn (or re-learn) some programming concepts from this book and it has gotten me started in ActionScript . I'm one of those poor schmucks ( aka: ""a designer"") that has been trying to learn programming on my own for six years and until recently, couldn't tell a function from a variable. So the fact that this book got a few programming concepts through my thick skull made it a worthwhile read... in spite of the errors."
1,I hate this cd and I am a fan of the T-heads,This has got to be one of the most disapointinng cd's I have ever bought. I love the T-heads and felt like I got ripped-off when I played this.
1,Too strong an odour.,The odour was bit too strong for me. I used this salt once and never dared to try it again.
1,Too hard...,"I have been doing step for 20 years and I couldn't follow this DVD. The steps are not broken down first to ease you into the combos. It looks like once you get it, it will be a good dvd, just can't get that far. I prefer the dvd's by Gin Miller. The steps are broken down first but not to the point where you get bored. Too bad...I was looking forward to this one."
1,Save money by NOT buying this book,"I found this book misleading, at best. The ideas in it are simply common sense -- anyone who has even played with the idea of embracing a more simple, frugal way of life already knows this stuff."
4,great ideas,What an adorable book. I just started to felt. I made a messenger bag for my laptop. It's great fun.
1,Disappointment,The workmanship on this lanyard is awful. The camo is only on one side of the lanyard. It looks terrible. Even the camo side of the lanyard looks stupid because half of the camo is on the outside of the lanyard and the other half is on the inside (hard to explain but if you ever get this you'll unfortunately find out for yourself). Spend your money on something you won't throw out.
3,Spectacular album...if it wasn't theirs,"I tried to like this more than I ended up liking it. Really I did. I constantly listened to it, and I still do. I don't listen to it the way I listen to Goddamnit or Maybe I'll Catch Fire though. I don't...listen to it. I use it as background music. I like the album. However, I'd like it more if 1. I wasn't expecting the greatness level of MICF or Goddamnit, or 2. if it was done by some other band."
5,A3 does it again!,"I think A3 is one of the best bands out there! They are everything you need! Their fast, melodic punk rock music pleasures your ears! Cmon! Go support them and buy their new CD!"
4,Robuster,"A great story and it was told when Mr.Burke really wanted to write a good book.Heart felt and like a lot of his better work well leave you just a little sad.It's a book that you can easily come back too.Having said that ,why is this book and others of his so high in price?This book is twenty years old. Better priced books out there that read just as good.Save your money and buy it at the local used book store for .50 cent.Love his work but the price must drop for his older books."
4,A good read,"The book moves quickly and the characters are sharply drawn. Morris' prose doesn't get in the way of a good story. The source is Chretien de Troyes' The Knight of the Lion and Morris adapts his material imaginatively.And that is all: it's a good story for young teens with strong characters, supported by a lively style of writing. Morris is neither Troyes nor Mallory.The Author's Note is an unfortunate embarrassment. Morris understands neither Homer nor Virgil if all he can say of them is that their works were ""just elaborate adventure stories for boys."" His criticism of Homer and Virgil's women--that they are ""disposable""--is simply wrong: Helen, Penelope, and Dido, to say nothing of the goddesses, possess a substance that has lasted millenia."
4,Intimate listening,"Picture yourself in an attractive bandbox of a club. A little smoke shades the lights from the bar. The spotlight is on a beautiful woman of a certain age, while a piano sounds softly in the background. As she begins to sing a familar melody, you relax and are transported to a different era. The romance of the songs matches the imaginary setting. Buy it, you'll like it!"
4,A must read for all,"This was a great book. Very well written. I am always nervous taking books from the J shelf because they might turn out simply, well simple. They are for children after all. Luckily for me this book pulled off a great story and a rather love Selznick's illustrations. So on to The Meanest Doll in the World."
5,TOUGH AS NAILS,"USE BOSTITCH TOOLS EXCLUSIVELY, NO DOWN TIME, NO MAINTENANCE. MY GUYS USE THEM FOR HAMMERS, DROP THEM FROM SCAFFOLDING, RARELY OIL THEM. THEY STILL KEEP ON GOING. HOW COULD THEY GET ANY BETTER. TWO N80'S, 2 YEARS OF ABUSE, STILL MAKING MY LIVING FOR ME. THANKS STANLEY."
3,Paslode vs. Bost,I know this isn't really a review but I was wondering what you all think about the pros and cons between the cordless Paslode nailer vs. all corded nailers? I have used both and like the overall speed with the hosed ones but to have one without the need for a compressor would be great. What do you all use and why? Thanks for your advice. Pete
2,"Disjointed, uncompelling","The sentences were short and choppy and the characterization was awful. Both hero and heroine were stereotypes with a few details thrown in for variety that matched neither's personality, i.e. the hero Nick who acts stodgy the whole book also moonlights as a country singer and skateboards,(...). The author mentioned her large bust size a lot, and I don't understand why. All the book left me with was a very poor impression of the author's personal taste and awareness of pop culture."
4,Reminded me of the commonwealth,"Does a good job of making you feel like part of an expanding galactic empire. Reminded me of Alan Dean Foster. Does a good job of describing 4 different aliens. Gets into a couple of their cultures. Describes different ways of sensing the world, and the resulting impact. We see our hero's changing personality as he comes back transformed to interact with humanity again. Thought provoking and still a fast paced read."
5,vailtrail.com/ weekly shuffle/ CD Review by Samantha Donen,"The Earlies, These Were The Earlies, Released Oct 25 2005The Doves, Franz Ferdinand, Arcade Fire...if these names do not ring a bell, get in the loop and buy These Were The Earlies. The Earlies deliver the goods in their 2nd Album; with multi instrumentation, effected samples, breaking beats, and catchy vocals. It is the epitome of emo retro rock with a Beatilesque sound. Perfect album to listen to on a long walk or drive..."
4,an album you just gotta hear !,The Action - Rolled Gold Reaction Recordings 1968The Action were one of the best long lost bands of all time ! May be best to describe The Actionn's music as perhaps a combination of the classic Who with The Small Faces and the happening 60's MOD scene. Hard to believe that this band didnt make it considering how good every song is on this album.
5,Perfect industrial stapler,"I bought my stapler in 1999 and it has been an incredible trouble-free tool. Only now, about 8 years later, do I need to replace the seals, a simple process. The parts cost about $25 and can be replaced in about half-hour. Read the instruction manual and oil it every day, and you should not have any worries."
3,Busted in shipment,"This tv came in damaged in shipment, so I cannot comment on how it performed. Amazon made the return of this item as easy as possible, even though it was not Amazon's fault."
1,Be Advised!,"I'm unsure how to criticize this CD, but other buyers should be aware of what they are buying. While a lot of work went into this CD, it is nothing but attempts to work standard techno beat stuff around repeated samples from the songs listed. Maybe these were hits in a club somewhere. The songs are barely recognizable. Not very listenable at all."
4,good booties,"My dog hated wearing these the first few walks, but she has gotten used to them. They also fell off the first couple of times she wore them, but now all four stay on for an entire walk - I think we just didn't have them tight enough. They make a huge difference with the salt, ice, snow getting stuck on her feet, and it's great not having to wipe off her feet when she comes inside. Some reviewers have said that the material wears off on the toes after walking on pavement. This is true, however, I'm not sure there is anyway to stop that from happening. It seems that any material on a dogs toes would wear from rubbing. I did put some duck tape on the toes before an actual hole formed and it's holding up fine. I'm glad we have the booties."
2,Guardian Gear Dog Boots - Yellow,"These boots seem to be well made, however, they would not stay on my dachshund's feet as they would not secure properly with the Velcro fasteners. I think they would work better on a dog with long legs so that the Velcro fastener would fit further up on the leg."
1,Worked for the first few months,"But eventually I started having nothing but problems with it. It would lock up and I find myself having to get up back and forth unplugging the thing and plugging it back it. Sometimes it would be okay, while on other days I would be up ever 5 minutes unplugging and replugging.Dlink has since discontinued the product altogether, was told that it offers that dual band capability and thats why it's having these problems. They ended up replacing the product with a different mondel after weeks of trouble shooting."
1,D-Link blew it on this one,"I purchased the D-Link DI-784 in June, 2005. It worked fine for about 6 months. Occasionally (about once a month), it locked up with all of the lights on solid, and I needed to reboot the device. It would work fine after rebooting for about another month. After about 6 months, the lock-ups would occur more frequently. Finally, today, it stopped altogether. All of the lights were on solid, and no amount of rebooting, powering off/on, etc., would make it work again.I'm very disappointed in the product. My expectations for its reliability were much higher. Every time a new version of the firmware was published by D-Link, I would install it on the DI-784. It didn't seem to make any difference.Fortunately, I had an old Linksys wireless router that I could re-install to get back onto the Net. I'm going to get a new wireless router, and it won't be from D-Link."
3,Basic Microeconomics in Industry Workbook,"Essentially a work-book refresher of microeconomics as typically experienced by industrial engineers or experienced MBAs, ""The Business-Engineer"" structures operational responses to short-term or long-term overcapacity or undercapacity problems.Topics include: crossroads (new time & new heroes, goals, funding, niche, decisions), development (systems, prices, distribution, communication, strategy, and organization), and summary.There is good use of sidebars, charts, storyline, financial ratios, examples of typical ambiguity of business, and free-form response boxes to engage the reader. Weaknesses include the slightly-pedantic style (too much throwaway non-value-add content), and ultimate lack of anything really new. Useful as an introduction (or short-course) to financial management and microeconomics in an industrial setting, but experienced industrial engineers and MBAs will be left wanting more."
5,"the best Factory release, period","During their existence in the early 1980's, Factory band Crispy Ambulance was dismissed as a Joy Division ripoff. It's true that C.A.'s early singles did sound an awful lot like J.D., but on The Plateau Phase, C.A. came into their own. On this incredible album there are hints of prog-rock, ambient, and eerie electronic effects combined with tense, shimmering guitar work and a bludgeoning rhythm section. Obviously Crispy Ambulance were pushing the boundaries, and their experiments with sound and texture paid off in spades. Listen to tracks like ""Are You Ready"", ""The Wind and The Season"", and the perhaps the bands finest song ""Chill"", and hear what I mean. As much as I love Joy Division (as well as many other Factory and post-punk bands of the time), for me The Plateau Phase stands as the most original and captivating album of the entire early 80's era. There has never been an album like this before or since."
3,Shipping via NetGrocers is an issue,"Pepperidge Farm Bordeaux cookies has my vote for the best cookies on the plannet.Problem was in the shipping/packaging, since in the 4 packs I've opened, I can count on 2 hands the number of whole (unbroken) cookies I've gotten. Most of the cookies are in pieces as big as or smaller than a quarter.I'd think twice about ordering cookies via the net."
2,"Love Tom's work, just not this.","I was really stoked once I heard Tom Morello was releasing an album through his folksy-alter ego. My friend got it for me last year for my birthday, but we were both fairly disappointed.I didn't find the music very impressive. I do like the style, but a lot of the riffs just felt... unoriginal or cliche to me. Not entirely sure how to describe it. And most people would agree his voice isn't exactly spectacular.On a somewhat unrelated note, I don't agree with Morello/Rage Against the Machine's political beliefs. I'd imagine people who think similarly might enjoy it more than I did, since the lyrics are an important part of the overall production of the album (arguably the most important, since Tom wrote the album to return to political activism).I don't know, give it a listen. Just think twice before buying it."
2,Pretty weak,"Look I'm not going to smash his guitar playing, it's acoustic and it's meant to be meaningful protest music (not saying you can't have both, but sometimes it's worth the sacrifice). Yeah it's not Rage, but you should have known that when you read ""Night Watchman"". Now for the attack. The lyrics are poor. I really don't feel like he put a whole lot of work into them. It seems like he's trying harder to rhyme the next word then to add meaning or flow to the song. He also seems like he's trying too hard when he sings. It's my personal opinion, but I suggest borrowing this CD or listening to a few tracks before just picking this up."
3,"Different, but not necessarily great","It sounds like someone listened to Springsteen's Nebraska until the vinyl went smooth like a river pebble. And he thought, ""Hell, I can do that. And since I'm Tom Morello, I can get it done. Someone write me a check.""Now, I'm down with the rootsy guitar folk, the Nick Cave-ishness, the smattering of Cash and all that, but there's something about the way he sings that makes me thing he's pulling my chain. There is nothing natural about the way you can *hear* him flexing his diaphragm at the beginning of every phrase and breathing his lyrics sensuously into the mic. It's like he's doing a sarcastic impersonation of a street player. I don't know what happened there, but it just doesn't gel.Good on you for spreading your wings, I guess. Now it's time to go back to what you're good at: blowing out my speakers. Let's get on that."
5,Melina Leon & the Tri O,Great dvd she is great with her voice & the Guittars are great I recomend it to everybody who like latin music
3,The main character Sam decides to take their class hamster to a field trip and they almost lose the hamster .,It was okay. The kid lost the hamster in a museum and then they found him and everything was fine.
3,Fun until the novelty wears off,"The game is quite fun and a little challenging for the first few levels. It gets boring becuase of the rail system (your path during play is predetermined) and because all of the zombies are pretty much the same throughout the game. It's a good game to pass around between friends but not a game that's going to get a lot of play time from user for an extended period of time. If you just feel like shooting something without any interesting story lines, then this game is for that. Definitely a game to borrow from a friend or a purchase from the cheap games bin."
5,Loved these shoes,I have gotten so many compliments on these shoes. The fit is great and are very comfortable. What a good buy at such a great price.
1,Disappointed,"Guess I just don't like Depeche Mode and the 80's sound of this film soundtrack. It needed more variety - - should have included Lou Reed's Brigh Lights Big City. Prince is a brilliant musician as are the others, but somehow it misses some vibrancy and distinctiveness."
3,Maria from Metropolis,"Although I am new at buying product online, neglect reading the specifics on the items, and tend to jump on the first one I can find. Overall I am pleased with this product, it has a few scratches, and I like product originally in its manufacture package, this was not, but the price was fine. As always, I passed up my chance when I seen it long ago in a store. Prices fluctuate at different stores and times. If you think you want something when you see it, pry the wallet open, you may never find it again, or pay a higher premium !"
5,Spreading the truth about God and His Love.,"This is one of the best books that I have ever read. I would give it ten stars if I could. It tells of Christ's great love for His people, and tells us all how much God loves us. It's a truly beautiful book, you could read again and again. I can't recommend this highly enough."
5,a new way of seeing God's love - feel free to dream again!,"The Sacred Romance opened my eyes to a new way of seeing the love of God - Jesus as the main character in the love story of God and His people. What joy to be able to fit the pain, the blessings, and the longings we experience into God's larger plan. A wonderful book - I especially reccomend it to people who love God in their minds but not yet in their hearts, and to those who are Christians, but don't expect to ever be completely fulfilled by God. I've been amazed by the realization that our deepest dreams and desires are good - placed there by God and always pointing back to Him."
5,Great display of God's Love,"I appreciate John Eldredge's books, and continue to garner as much wisdom from them as I can. I especially like The Sacred Romance because it displays an interpretation of God's love that is so deep and intimate, you can't help but view God differently after reading this book. I would consider this book the foundation for all of Eldredge's books; so if you were to read any of his books, read this one first. It's the foundation that we all need, loving God first. We need to accept the Sacred Romance and dive into it.God bless."
4,Not a Girly Book,"This is not a girly book; don't let the title fool you. The Sacred Romance was a really important book for me when I was in college. It helped me understand the big picture of the Bible: the story of God and the story of my own life. It helped me understand the difference between living by the rules and living spiritually.Curtis and Eldredge pull a ton from Frederick Buechner (one of my absolute favorite authors). If you're interested in this book, you should also check outThe Sacred Journey: A Memoir of Early Daysas well asTelling Secretsand any Buechner you can get your hands on (fiction and non-fiction alike)!"
1,"Awkward, Doesn't Fit Well, & Was Not as Described","I went 'round & 'round with this seller trying to get him to fess up to the fact that it was not as described. It was $3.90, so I cared more about the principle than the product, which was terrible--completely useless. It's awkward, doesn't fit will, & definitely can't be put on quickly to answer the phone--when you finally do get it on it's very uncomfortable, & doesn't stay on. I needed it for work, so it was completely unacceptable.The seller also harassed me about leaving a negative review. Amazon went WAY out of their way to make it right."
2,The article was damaged,"buy this headset and when I received the item came damaged, wrote to customer service and received no response. the headset had a serious injury on the handset."
4,Great Nail Gun,"Good fit works flawlessly, i own 2 other N80CB guns. Using 2"" pallet nails in hardwood. Rebuild kits readily available ."
2,Try Hitachi,"** See my review of the N89C as wellI bought a N80 and it would not drive a 3"" or a 3 1/4"" galv. spiral nail into Douglas Fir. After sending the gun in to see what was wrong with it. It was send back with nothing wrong. I took the gun, the nails, and the wood to the Bostitch distributor. They could not get it to drive the nails. Even the new one they pulled off the shelf did not do it. They gave me a N89. The depth adjustment on the N89 is nice and it has never jambed. Changing nail sizes is much easier then the N80.Both the N80 and the N89 double fire easily. I have listen to nails land 50-60ft away on the street.The crew framing my house uses 4 Hitachi NV83 guns. Thees guns are more balanced, drive 3 1/4"" nails no problem, and I have not had a double fire yet. The Hitachi guns run 3-6 coils of nails a day 6 days a week in the mud and sawdust. If I ever wear my N89 out I'll be spending the extra $$$ on the Hitachi."
2,good tool,this air gun is unstopable .. for a small contractor who dose the work .. this is the tool to have
2,Almost Obsolute?,"Not really made for siding. It is big and heavy. I could only special order nails which were thicker then regular siding nails and cost about three times as much. Home depot, Lowes, and Amazon do not carry siding nails for it. I couldn't even get framing nails for it in my area. Although Amazon carries two types of framing nails. It is a good gun to build crates as long as you can find nails for it. It is ok for framing. But, framers use stick nailers."
3,Not a fit for the very young,"This book is wonderfully illustrated and the overall message is valuable, but some of the content and language is not appropriate for ages 4-6. The whole book is framed by the older narrator thinking of his father who has been dead for many years. With my child and many other young ones, this sparks the question about whether their mother and father are going to die soon -- not exactly Christmas material. I regularly read my daughter many books geared for older children, but this book has overall sentence structures and word choices that are really not in my mind geared for children."
1,Nope!,"Four technicians at Avery, two at MC...no one was able to get DesignPro to work on my MAC. Avery won't support Safari, Firefox won't support Adobe on Avery. 4.5 hours and I can't print one label.No, Avery, just NO."
1,This book is too unrealistic,"This book sux. The critical hits chart is very stupid, a goblin is not going to cut a big human's arm off with a daggar. The strategy of things on the board with squares on it is very impractical. I haven't found one useful thing in that book to date."
1,utter horse manure,"Don't be misled by the good reviews that seem to outnumber the bad ones here. The bad ones are genuine. This film is utterly worthless. If you are a particular fan of one of the stars, and you feel compelled to watch every film they have ever made, then I suppose you will have to sit through the whole thing -- otherwise run for the hills. I didn't waste a whole 98 minutes of my life, as one of the reviewers here did, but I wasted 30, then I had to turn it off. Luckily it was just a netflix movie -- I can only imagine having to sit through this at the full cinema price, or having purchased it on DVD for $25. The reviewer that said that people were leaving the cinema in droves is accurate. Don't waste your money. I would have given this 0 stars, if I could have. This is now my worst movie in recent memory (though it does have a good cast whose talents were wasted in this turkey), now supplanting The Happening, another one that you don't want to see."
5,Miracle skin cream,LOVE this and ALL of the AminoGenesis skin products! I have extremely sensitive skin and have found that this is one line of skin care products that doesn't irritate my skin or make me break out. What a GREAT moisturizer!
2,The bottles may be indestructible......,"The bottles are sturdy, strong, and don't give water that plastic taste that makes you gag. However, the lid broke less than a month after I had the bottle. I ordered two of these and they broke. Very poor quality in the lid. Skip this for a better quality item."
4,"Okay audio, superb (but quirky) video, excellent value.","Audio is quite good for a set in this price range, but still suffers in comparison to, say, my [amt]computer speakers.Image quality, judged from DVD and current-generation gaming consoles connected via component video inputs, is absolutely superb; the default/baseline visual settings produce horribly exaggerated screen contrast, although this is easily tweaked and remedied.My rating is based on quality alone; on quality for price, however, 5/5 would be more appropriate."
2,Great picture - troubling noise problems,"The Toshiba 24AF42 may have one of the best quality pictures available, even with a plain vanilla cable connection. You may not even notice the difference in image quality between this and a 27"". With that said, the 24"" Toshiba has a noticable humming/buzzing that is terribly annoying at all but high volumes. You will definitely notice the hum at low volumes or on mute. It was annoying enough for me to send the TV back the next day. That's too bad. I really wanted to like this TV."
1,what happened to this band?,"this band was great for about an album and a half, then turned to total commercial crap. buy surrealistic madness and then pretend they broke up b/c after the first album they are absolute crap. If I could give negative 2000 stars I would, what a bunch of sell outs"
1,What a waste of money,"This album blows. When someone asks me ""what's the album you regret spending your money on?"" I always say ""Candiria - What Doesn't Kill You."" I gave it ONE star but it really deserves ZERO, unfortunately that's not an option."
2,Half of it is worthwhile,"only one thing gets me madder than ever...and that's when great musicians have people write songs for them. Look in the liner notes. CANDIRIA only wrote half of the songs. Maybe after their near-death van accident they were like...""we need to sell-out and get money and b*tches and a tour bus, cause then we'd be set."" this ""full-lenght"" should have only been an EP with the 5 songs on it that count. I am thoroughly disappointed with this effort and I am glad that one guitar player left because he knew he didn't want to be a part of something so crappy. Candiria...write another ""300 Percent Density"" and then get back to me. THanks for making me waste my money sellouts."
1,"$140 list for poly blend? Come on Amazon, Come on!","I've bought so many great deals from Amazon, but every so often they really had a loser - like this one. Who's propaganda is this? They claim $140 MSRP on a poly cotton blend--it's garbage."
3,Revolutionary,It's revolutionary that it was the first purely electronic score for a film. It works wonderfuly in tandem with the movie. You couldn't ask for better to set the tone and atmosphere for the film. Does it stand on it's own though? I don't think it does completley. That in no way is a slam for it in the fact it is perfect for what it is. Listening to the soundtrack itself though can be underwhelming and definetley have to be in the right mood and setting to enjoy it. For me it's just not that often. It's worth having though and I'm glad I bought it.
5,Excellence,"This is a first class effort that makes finding stars constelations and understanding the heavens a breeze for anyone.The photo work is top shelf. And the overlays are the cherry on top. I gave my neighbor a copy for x-mas. He and his three daughters are just getting into astronomy. This book will move them ahead and rivet their intrest. And as a coffee table book it will draw anyone's attention, and educate even the most casual on looker. It is worth every penny. Go for it!"
2,Dark Lotus,This never should have been re-released with ABK. His lispy speech is to much to take serious and ruins the cd. Marz version is so much better so buy that one instead.
1,it wont play not happy at all,i cant play it on my dvd player.or anybody elses players. not happy at all with item.
4,Positive Review,The book was in good condition as described by the seller. Shipping was as expected. All around a good purchase!
3,Ivanhoe(DVD Format)--Hearing Impaired Beware!!,"This is an excellent production of Scott's classic, as only the British seem to be able to do. However, my personal peeve is that the DVD format isn't Closed Captioned as is the 6-cassette VHS set. I can't understand why A & E does that. I'd definitely would pay more for this DVD of Ivanhoe, if a price increase was necessary to make it Closed Caption. That's why I gave it only 3 stars."
4,Love historical period pieces,"This is an old television series from England, but it's still fun to watch. It's the story of Ivanhoe, with elements of King Richard and Robin Hood. Who doesn't love a little swashbuckling from time to time? If you like historical period pieces, you'll like this set."
2,Pretty Awful,"I could probably write a lot about how many different ways this version is bad. But, I won't. I'll just list a few.1) Not faithful at all to the book (especially the characters and dialogue)2) Crass3) Low production quality4) Rebbecca is uglyRent it if you like, see for yourself, but don't waste your money buying it unless you know what you're getting into. Hardcore ivanhoe fans will hate this film."
2,Ivanhoe,"This movie presented a ridiculous insinuation that Richard the Lionheart and his brother John were somehow ""brokered"" into a peaceful relationship by their mother. I don't believe that was part of Walter Scott's novel nor was women's lib in fashion at the time of the story. To see two grown men in power positions at that time in history being chastized by their mother was almost laughable."
2,Tiny,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter's garden, thinking it would really stand out. Not so. It is very small, and the light can't even be seen unless you are within 2 feet of it, max."
5,love it,I got one ball for my 7 year old son and one for his friend. They both just started to play basketball. They love this ball.
1,False Advertising,If you are expecting to get the basketball shown in the picture you will be very disappointed. They charge you and show you a $15 ball that is of very good quality but ship you a cheap $7 rubber ball.I'm not the first to complain about this but they refuse to change the picture. If you read these reviews after you purchase the ball (like I did) then just return it for a full refund. Go to Wal-Mart and buy the ball in the picture for $15. Maybe if enough people do it they'll change the picture.
5,Good Deal,Basketball came quickly and was just as described. Ready to be used right out of the package. Kids love it.
4,make sure of size before you buy.,It is a good basketball but was bigger than we expected. We had purchased another youth basketball before which was more the size we wanted. we didn't realize there was more than one size for a youth basketball. so if you buy check and make sure it is the size you want first. All in all a great basketball though and good buy.
3,Okay. Nothing special.,This has a definite rubber feel. The street ball has a better rubber cover. It is a good sized ball for the elementary kids to learn the game.
1,A disappointing and far-fetched read.,"Tama Janowitz's creation, Pamela Trowel, is one of the most self-defeating and sorry protagonists I've seen. Janowitz piles on the problems for Pamela, but doesn't equip her with the sense or the wit to cope. It's one thing for an unrelenting series of bad things to happen to a character, and quite another when the protagonist does nothing about them, or worse, brings them on herself. For instance, seeing a bad psychiatrist who holds his sessions in a bar is something that should be easily remediable. The point where I decided the book wasn't worth it anymore was where Pamela comes across a severed head in a plastic bag, decides it's one of those fake severed heads from a novelty shop, and merrily takes it to the kid she is sort-of, kind-of kidnapping. Well, oops, it was an actual bloody, messy severed head, and we are supposed to believe that she couldn't tell the difference. No, and if she truly is that ignorant, I have no interest in her story."
4,Nice road tire for your MTB,"Good all around road-type tires for your mountain bike. I got them for my sister's Trek MTB because she doesn't do much off road. These tires help make your MTB into more of a hybrid. They are much quicker and smoother than knobbies. My only criticism is that they're still a bit wide, so you're not going to be super fast, but i'm used to road bike tires. Overall a good road tire for the money."
4,good tire for the money,"I bought these tires for an old bike that I couldnt find tire for at any of the big box stores. They are a good tire for the price, they went on relatively easily and perform well. I use my bike mostly on the street and the perform well with low resistence"
5,Amazing,"If you loved the original Tomb Raider, then get ready for an amazing adventure, full of nostalgia and new surprises.I was amazed at the graphics. The game is so beautiful and realistic.The first Tomb Raider had many larger areas, but that also led to many tedious things you'd have to do to pass a level. This game streamlines everything from the first game. This doesn't mean everything is easy. There is definitely a challenge here and some puzzles will have you thinking for a long time.I definitely recommend this game!!"
2,I broke my controller!,After beating Tomb Raider Underworld I thought I'd give the PS2 versions a shot and I am one of the few who didn't like this game. The controls feel unresponsive when you have to make quick moves. The T-Rex boss battle was enough for me to quit. You can't dodge the guy very well. You are running backwards shooting trying to get him to charge into some spikes that you can't see behind you. I rarely just give up on a game but playing a boss battle for hours and not getting past that point ceases to be fun.
2,Un-happy anniversary,"I've always been a fan of Lara Croft. Oddly though, never been a huge fan of Tomb Raider. The game play is a crawl-balance-move away from identical. The camera is dizzying that quickly leads to just plain old annoying. Lara is still a great icon to move around, but the pedestal of memory has faded. I don't regret visting the familiar simply for nostalgias sake, but failed to realize there may be consequences."
3,Legal Brief - (brief as I can),"Description: Grisham lite. Characters: thin. Action: Plenty. Potential: solid summer movie. Title: unconnected to actual story but might sell movie tics.Dissenting opinion: Protagonist's ""legal malpractice"" near beginning could have been corrected on the spot and a real judge would have insisted on it."
4,Much Better than Capitol Murder,"Looks like Margolin is back...after Capitol Murder, I was getting a little nervous that he'd lost something, but he's back in fine form with The Burning Man. In true fashion he kept me guessing up to the very end. For Margolin fans, skip Capitol Murder and read this one, its worth it!"
2,"Wordy, rambling, hard to follow","I own but have not read Sex Laws and Cyberspace in its entirety. This is because the book is poorly written and hard to read.The book deals with cogent questions about types of pornography and legal problems in the theory and practice of censoring it.However, it appears Wallace and Mangan aimed at length instead of lucidity in each paragraph and chapter. Reading page after page of their rambling narrative is simply too much."
5,I bought two,I bought one of these for my daughter for Christmas and liked it so much I bought one for my son too. The picture and sound are great. It looks like a flat screen without the price. I plan to buy another one for another family member for her birthday.
1,Bad deal,Please refund my money I placed the order close to a month ago and have not got anything. I need the nailer or a refund Thank you.
3,the last book of the universe,both my grandson and i read this book. we enjoyed what it represents.he had to read it for school and i read after him.
5,The best book in the universe,"The Last book in the Universe was one of the best books I have ever read. It will keep your attention until the very last page. There is a surprise at the end that you would never have seen coming. This book is a futuristic, post apocalyptic novel and and can relate to young adults very easily.This book even has its own form of slang which you can catch onto very quickly.The author Rodman Philbrick wrote this book very well with no dull or boring moments."
5,"The Last Book in the Universe, review by Critic Chris","This was an excellent book! Avery different, but excellent book. This is a must read. It is scie-fi genre, but I am not a sci-fi reader. Rodman Philbrick has done it again by giving us one of his deep and heavy childrens selections. Check it out. It was an excellent book!"
4,Great Science Fiction,I loved this book and think anyone who liked The Giver by Lois Lowry will like it too.
4,Gates of Hell or Gates of Paradise,"The Last Book in the Universe is a wonder book by Rodman Philbrick. It is almost perfect except for the fact that it ends. The story is about a snobby, genetically improved girl named Lanaya, an epileptic boy named Spaz, an old ""gummy""(old person) named Ryter, and a boy named Little Face who only says ""chox""(candy bar). They go on an adventure to save Bean (Spaz's sister) who has leukemia. Rodman Philbrick's stile of writing is unique because he uses very unusual words like ""takvee"" and ""proov."" The word are unusual and unique because no one has ever used them before, and they sound weird. This is one of my favorite books; the characters are interesting, and the setting is peculiar. ..."
1,QuikDrive Review,"Prior to buying this tool, I read previous reviews on this site. As the reviews were mixed, I bought the kit and only 1 box of screws, just in case I had to return it. I look for a tool to work right out of the box. Initial set up was easy and I followed all instructions to the letter. I never got the first screw to go in correctly, nor did the screwgun advance a single screw correctly. I went back to the instructions again and again, reassembled everything and still same results. I am returning tool back to Tool Crib for a full refund. So, I will be screwing thousands of screws the old fashioned way. I don't know why the mfg does not test drive each of these units before shipment. Anyway, it turned out to be a zero for me."
4,Aprendizaje,"While I don't find the information about composition very interesting, the book is a fantastic resource for grammar, proving in-depth explanations and good examples. I wish they had this book in hardcover because the paperback front cover is hard to keep in good condition."
1,Amazon In Shady Business Deal? Shocking!,Do not buy this record. You will be playng a hand in the exploitation of Captain Beefheart.
5,The boss when it comes to Brad nailers!,"Plenty of power and easy to get into tight places. The Hitachi brad nailer takes most everyones brads, so you can always get nails for it. This tool has everything you need in a BRAD nailer and comes with a great case."
2,Disappointed in the Hitachi Brad Nailer,"Bought the Hitachi brad nailer thinking I was getting a good deal on a good product. Needless to say, I got what I paid for.Excited to put my new tool to work, I decided to install some moulding. I was able to nail in about 30 feet of moulding before I got fed up and quit. The gun jammed on me I don't know how many times, and double/triple fired on numerous occasions. Each time this happened, I had to stop working to remove the jammed nail or remove the nail from the moulding.I checked the manual numerous times to see what could possibly be causing these problems, but nothing worked.I even checked the box of nails numerous times to make sure I was using the right gauge brad.I've decided to return this nailer in exchange for an American made product.Now I wondering if I did the right thing by purchasing the Hitachi compressor."
2,"Harmful, Hobbling ""Hysteria's Herstory""","I'm giving this book two stars instead of three because the author felt compelled to waste so much white space on her leftwing, feminist agenda. Ms. Harwood has published several articles on the supposed sexism of Latin textbooks, and so litters her book with largely pointless textboxes containing ""gender-specific historical tidbits"" which she calls ""Hysteria's Herstory."" (Something tells me that doesn't have quite the alliterative ring the author intended.)Likewise, what Ms. Harwood refers to as ""the Christian Church"" of the so-called Dark Ages is in reality the Catholic Church. Presumably, the correct identifier didn't sit well with her progressive sensibilities.For an agenda-free discourse on Latin, get the Dummies book or stick with Wheelock's Latin 6e."
2,Poor editing and organization.,"This book suffers from poor editing and proofreading. From the first chapter on, there are many mistakes such as an exercise which says the answers are in the appendix, but the appendix skips the exercises for that chapter. Then one exercise had a list of words to be matched to the English translation, but not only repeated one of the Latin entries but listed a different pronounciation. Throughout the book I found many errors of omission or just plain mistakes. The website for the Idiot's Guides has been down for a re-make and so I haven't been able to see if an addendum is posted. I'd skip this book and go to one of the standard texts. With the number of mistakes in this book, it makes me wonder about the rest of the content; am I trying to learn something not realizing it is another mistake? Avoid this book."
2,Weak,"This book looks nice; it's easy on the eye. But what I found dis-appointing was the short shrift given to pronunciation. The read-er is referred to the library for anything more than the sketchytreatment you'll find in the book.The other main thing I disliked about the book was the way hugeblocks of words are presented at a time. (And the words aren'tcarefully selected, either.) You'll find it difficult to chew anddigest so many words at one time, esp. since there aren't a lot of exercises to go along with them.The book has some minor blemishes as well, but these two reasonsare so weighty that I can only recommend that you look elsewhere.I like Wheelock a lot better with all the quotes from ancient writers and the words marked for pronunciation."
1,GAG! THIS IS AWFUL!!,"I have read 3 books by this woman and they are all EXACTLY THE SAME. Ms. Small seems to have a fascination with rape and adultery. I however do not. I have learned my lesson. No, I'm not a prude but I will never again waste my money or library card on anything this sick, sad and mentally deficient woman."
5,Meditation Guide,"The heart of this album is a collection of meditation chants by Tibetan monks. Their voices and musical instruments seem timeless. This is my favorite album for meditation. With a darkened room, a lit candle, and this album I can travel to the great monasteries in Tibet and experience some of the wisdom of Buddha's teachings."
2,"quality good, but lousy product offering","you need 3 things to have a roll top installed. This is only 1 of them. You would also have to buy the rails (short bed, or long bed) and either a clamp or a screw kit. You would think they could bundle the right rails with the right top, and throw in some screws. On the other hand, the factory was super nice and sent me the missing parts at no charge, but, I wouldn't count on that every time.Of course none of this is listed in the product offering and since it shows the top completely installed including the non-included parts, its very misleading."
2,Education,These are books for my daughters education so I do not know how to rate these books. For BA degree
3,Decent for what it does.,"I have a decent sized pond and I thought this thing would help with some of the sludge. The bag was hard to clean. It really is better for larger, hard to reach items, like leaves and such."
3,in a flash,"this product arrived in a glass bottle that leaked slightly, leaving a trivial amount of wet cardboard. the bottle is quite large and not too ideal for us busy women to lug around in our overly crowded purses. it does work to instantly refresh your skin and makeup, as for a balanced complexion i dont think it works that well. sephora makes a flash radiance spray thats purse sized and excellent. even on 12 hours shifts at hospitals."
1,sucks,"i used to buy this for my old printer. its cheap which is why i bought it but they changed brands. i know it was generic, but they switched brands and it wasn't as good. my print jobs turned out as if i was running out of ink. i will never buy again."
4,A thought-inspiring book,"This collection of paradoxes and mind-tickling puzzles is well worth a read. This was one of my first ventures into the world of philosophic literature, and I found it to be a great start. Although I do not accept all of Poundstone's explanations, I found many to be amazingly intelligent."
2,Not impressed,"Not really a mind-blower, and certainly not a fast read.\Overall I found it boring, but maybe that's because I usually like my reading to be interesting."
3,"If you love Fleming, this CD is for you!","Aftering receiving this CD from a friend in NY. I have listened about 10times, I still can't get it. Well, if you like Strauss and Fleming, this Cd is for you. Otherwise,I do recommend for you to listen before you buy."
2,Dame Kiri Te Kanawa is Still And Always the Eminent...,"Dame Kiri Te Kanawa is still and always the eminent lyric soprano. At fifty-six years old, she stills radiates like a thirty-year old soprano! I know, because I have all of her recordings on CD from her 1983 release to the current 1999 release of ""Maori Songs.""I've heard Flemming, Bonney, and Graham; Bonney and Flemming does not even come close to Te Kanawa's feet in Strauss repertoire!I've had the privilege of owning the ""Vier Letze Lieder"" with Te Kanawa as the soloist reinforced by the world-class orchestra, The Vienna Philharmonic under Sir Georg's baton. Flemming's interpretation of ""Vier Letze Lieder"" does not make a scratch on the surface of Richard Strauss' ""Vier Letze Lieder.""Fans will compare Flemming to Te Kanawa, but it is fultile for doing so is like comparing a neophyte novice student to a grand-master sensei."
3,"wonderful singing, boring music","Fleming and Graham are divine singers, but to my taste this Strauss music is extremely dense and unmelodic. I just dont understand why such a gifted, sensational and totally exceptional singer like Fleming keeps recording Strauss instead of other French and Italian composers."
5,Nearly perfect album,"This album is a true masterpiece. And I mean no disrespect to Sail Away. What can I say - Randy Newman has created multiple masterpieces. :-)My only reservation is that Four Eyes seems a little off-peak. Ah well, everyone's a critic..."
4,Siding nailer,"Gun worked very well with the exception of shooting double on occasion, not sure if that's really the gun, but it did a nice job and was easy to use.Best price we found was here.The nails were purchased at Home Depot web site and they were less than in the actual store and were delivered in 3 days.Very happy with purchase."
3,Would be great if...,"Hitachi has a great nailer but they absolutely, positively need to include the single shot upgrade kit at no extra cost as this gun fires multiple nails far too easily and jams like you wouldn't believe. It's a great nailer as far as feel and weight but do yourself a favor and install the single shot nail kit.Hitachi, shame on you for not building this into the gun or offering the upgrade at no extra cost.As it stands now, I'd recommend to others to look at the Makita coil nailer as the best choice and then the Porter Cable as the second choice."
4,One of a Kind,This is the only video review of this program and it is good to have a copy as a unique reference item with interviews of the original cast..
3,ALL Occasions...It's True...,"The title of this book is justified. It indeed does provide ""toasts"" for ALL occasions. If you are one that has no idea of what to say, is short on words, not use to making toasts or your mind just goes blank at the thought of wording a toast yourself...then you must have this book. If you are wordy, have a good memory or just need something to fuel your creative toasty flame...then this book is for you TOO.It provides toasts for every event imaginable and then a few that you would not imagine. Some sections are redundant or have only changed a word or two in the toast, but it is still worth buying. There are short ones, long ones, poetic ones, funny ones, sincere ones and yes...even crazy onesYou don't really know what you are missing, until you find what you have been waiting for...could this book be for you?"
3,Not what I expected,"They're just so much smaller than I had anicipated, & they're bottoms aren't round like in the picture but spiked. Also they didn't come with string to hang them up...finally, they seem to be made of yellow crystal rather than clear crystal."
2,Poor Quality,"I bought these crystals as director's gifts for my husbands cast from ""Blithe Spirit"". I was so pleased to find pretty 30% lead crystals as such a low price. The faceting is good, the problem is the opening at the top for a cord or hanger. They are poorly cut and almost impossible to get anything through. It took Him several HOURS to work a small gold thread through 12 of them for the gift bags. If you're buying them to put into a bowl or other container for display they're a bargain."
1,"crystal looks pretty, but its ""rainbows"" are pitiful","crystal looks pretty, but its ""rainbows"" are pitiful. no good for rainbows. it is so tiny it is useless except as a Christmas tree or table top decoration . This items was WAY better:76mm Teardrop Suncatcher Crystal Prisms #873-76"
5,Splendid,"I am kind of iffy about foreign films that are subtitled because you have to pay an extra sensitive amount of attention to the movie. But this film I couldn't revert my eyes away from the screen for one second. Watching the movie in it's undubbed natural language enhanced it.This movie is about four generations of families and their lives. It is very very well made. It has humor, drama, and action all in one movie. Everything flows together nicely. And the storyline is perfect. You grow to love Antonia's family.This is probably the best foreign movie I have seen."
3,Well Done but Too Polemic at Times,"As many reviewers have already pointed out, Antonia's Line is a film that celebrates women, their power and independence, their healthy condition that they enjoy when they are free from men, their superior spirituality to the male gender. Upon a second viewing, I found the film a bit annoying, painting women as smug earth mothers, and men as testosterone-deranged crackpots who must be kept at a distance. Thus one women ""allows"" a man to impregnate her but, deeming him an unnecessary presence, wants to raise her child on her own. The only men that are looked at with kindness in this film are emasculated neurotics, professorial, melancholy eunuchs, and the like. The polarity between women as spiritual earth mothers and men as troglodytes is a grotesque oversimplification and impedes the film's noble attempt to question male-dominant roles and how those roles have subjectated women."
5,Charming,"Finally, a picture that won the foreign films Oscar that deserved it! Beautifully filmed and a story line which quickly engages the viewer. Antonia is the epitome of women- strong, loving, generous to her friends, and merciful to the less fortunate as well as unconventional, comedic,and a temper to boot. A wonderful fim."
3,button size and lighting up is good...but...,"if your mom is having trouble with the remote, it might not just be because she can't read/see the buttons. this device obviously eliminates those problems, very nicely.what it doesn't do is teach a senior citizen how to use a remote for multiple devices. probably nothing can, at this rate. (and i say that having been a professional IT trainer and documentation expert for almost 20 years!)it's not the item's fault, although the layout of the buttons isn't great. i tried to use the item myself, but found it so huge and awkward to hold, i actually just gave up and freecycled it to a neighbor!"
1,Non functional,"Tried the same model in multiple tv sets. Craig model tv wouldnt recognize any code nor manually calibrate. Magnavox calibration was all screwy (volume button turned off power, channel button was a number, etc). Gave several attempts and restarts to no avail."
1,Bad,I still have not and probably will never receive this item. They suck. That's all I have to say.
5,"Cowabunga, dude!","Bart Simpson has never been more hilarious than in this rollicking adventure! Our spiky-haired hero is in over his head this time, when his out-of-control invention turns Springfield inside out! Mike Reiss deserves a Grammy for this delightfully clever ode -- or should I say -- an ANAGRAMMY! Eat my shorts -- or should I say -- ""TEA YM THORSS"""
5,Tarot mistress writes book on Kabbalah,Jewish sage and wise woman Rachel Pollack has written a wonderful book on Kabbalah. Let Rachel be your Rabbi as she takes you on a journey through the kabbalah tree. This book contains information that is ancient and new. It can appeal to long time students of kabbalah and to the person who wants to learn more. Rachel has coined the term 'justice and joy'. With the teaching in this book we can learn to bring justice and joy into our own lives and the world.
2,"Poor, but cheap","This was my first airsoft gun and it works reasonanly well for target practice. The issue is it simply isn't very well made. First off it is innaccurate, of course I didnt expect much, but still. Simply inneffectice at ranges greater than twenty feet, and within that it is hardly fast firing enough to be a guarenteed win in that distance. In airsoft wars it is a alright side arm but their are much better ones. Also after a few weeks of standard use (didnt drop it, but carried it to quite a few wars and put mabey a thousand round through it) it became unusable. It devolped problems with its cocking slide where it would come off entirely whenever it was cocked leading to hilarious situations where you have to assemble the gun to shoot it. After that it just quit shooting. If you are looking for a not to serious airsoft gun or a cheap sidearm by all means get it. If you expect accuracy or durability look elsewhere."
2,Unreliable,"I guess this gun is ok for beginners. But the thing is that when you shoot it, it never shoots the same way twice. sometimes it will shoot somewhat accurate but most of the time it either drops straight down or curves off so much that its completely impossible to hit anything unless your right on top of it. The only thing i kinda like about this gun is that mine (from walmart) came with a speed loader that holds like 88 rounds. But overall, spend a little more and get a better gun."
3,Overview good; streetmap only so-so,"The free streetmap provided by the Hong Kong tourist bureau is much, much better than the Insight version. The overview map of Hong Kong is very good and the site recommendations are fine. Lamination is a plus."
2,I'm A Huge Mary Mary Fan and this is a Huge Disappointment,"I am a big Mary Mary fan. I love both of their original albums. However, this CD has been a big disappointment. The whole thing seems just thrown together. The lyrics from the original songs are frequently lame. Two whole tracks are devoted to the really bad ""California Christmas"" which at best appeals to a very limited demographic living in the southern California area. I don't know about you, but Christmas songs about the ""Cali Way"" don't have much appeal for me. The highly repetitive ""Call Him Jesus"" sounds like any gospel production you can find in small churches around the country. ""The Real Thing,"" ""Hark the Herald..."" and ""Carol of the Bells"" are each OK, but not enough to redeem this CD as a whole. My recommendation is that you put your Christmas music money somewhere else."
3,Hidden appeal,"I am a die hard Serrie fan, but I am over his experimentation with the Native American theme. ""Spirit Keepers"" was enough for me, and although it was good (with time, since I don't listen to a great deal of Native American music), he didn't need to create a sister c.d., which is even weaker than ""Spirit Keepers"". All is not lost on this release, though. With Serrie, there will always be nice moments, such is on the first two and final two tracks. In between, it's mostly annoying, with Gary Stroutsos' flute playing coupled with Jonn Serrie's minimal soundscape backdrop. This c.d. could easily get lost without much notice in the world of Native American music, except that Jonn Serrie has gained a very good reputation for premium space music. For this reason, it will be exposed to a wider audience, some of whom will likely be less than impressed. Hopefully, Jonn Serrie has exited this trendy genre of music and has started projects in other directions."
2,Skip it!,"Skip it! This product cost too much for just1 bottle!Plus, it's chalky and it can take up to 1 hourTo work..Not happy..Color oops may Stink, but it works great!"
2,Pulitzer?,I guess this won the Pulitzer for the most comprehensive theory. There is too much unnecessary information in this book. This was like reading the transcript of your grandfather's latest 19 hour talking spree on the civil war and the post civil war era. ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzz!!! If you like to know about every nook n' cranny about the a few few characters from the civil war and the post civil war era mixed with a thick layer of philosophy then this is your book. But don't take my word for it. This was a required reading for a Master's class.
1,Yuck!!,This cd is horrible. I wish I could have listened to it before purchasing it - I never would have bought it!
5,Falcon Guide Reveiw By a Avid Mountain Biker,"From cover to cover this guide allows you to follow it's contents easily and affectively. You won't be wasting your ride time figuring out where to go. The maps are easy to read, giving you just the right information. There are graphs that show you distance in relation to elevation, a real helpful tool in guaging if this ride will be what you want. It also discribes terrain and gives a scale of difficulty to aide in the decision making. I enjoy carring this book with me when I ride because it is so easy to use. I would highly recomend this and other Falcon guides to any avid mountain biker like myself."
2,Not accurate enough to use for planning,"I have occasionally referred to this before accepting an invitation to ride a new trail. But, only for the overview. It is not reliable or accurate enough to use for planning. I can't imagine the publisher let it go to press before getting some editing help from people who know the area."
2,Power Ranger Pinball machine,"My son is four years old and has been in Power Ranger mania for the past year. We own almost all of the Time Force toys (actually, we probably have all of them). We just received the pinball machine as a Christmas gift. I'm really not happy with it. It is EXTREMELY loud, to the point where I don't think that it's in a range that is safe for little ears. We tried to put some tape over the speaker, but it didn't make it much quieter. The inability to control the volume kind of ruins the fun."
2,deceiving picture,"When I ordered the pinball machine I based my purchase on the picture displayed, wrong I will never do that again, the picture shown has six bells with power rangers on them the one shipped to me has 3 bells and the power rangers sit up by the score panel, the picture was very misleading and did not represent the one shipped to me. Because this was bought for our grandson to take on vacation and play with while traveling we don't have time to return it to get another one and have learned a lesson from this purchase."
4,"Cute, fun, worth a watch","OK, so the storyline in this movie isn't that great. Paul Rudd's character was pathetic but his dynamic with his fiance, and new best friend was comical and fun. Plus, I love Paul Rudd as an actor and was able to forgive his character for a lot of his character flaws.The movie is cute, typical chick lit and worth a watch."
4,Great Movie,"If you are a male and have ever been in a dating relationship, or you know a male that has ever been in a dating relationship, this movie will make you laugh. Great situational humor. I thought the cast selection was pretty neat as well. I am not a very big movie kind of guy, but I thought this was a good one."
5,"Perfect Movie, Perfect Shipping","I saw a pre-screening of I Love You, Man and subsequently made everyone I knew go see it when it came out in theatres. This is a quick-witted, thoroughly enjoyable comedy with just a smack of discomfort (due mostly to Paul Rudd's awkward character quirks).....a.k.a. A Near Perfect Comedy.I love this movie and highly recommend it to those who enjoyed Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Wedding Crashers. (Of course, it doesn't hurt that I have a little crush on Jason Segel.....)"
4,Nice,"This shirt is very comfortable, cool on the course. It does fit a little ""big"", but definitely a great addition...had a bit more texture to it in person, it looks like a solid pique in the picture, but it's got more texture than that..."
5,Graceful,"Whispering Wind Barbie is the picture of grace and beauty. Her blue irridescent (with a hint of lavender) skirt swirls around her, seeming to billow with the breeze. Her bodice of white shirred satin is embellished with delicated sequins and beads. Her stole is sky blue chiffon, wire edged, so that it can swirl around her. It too is embellished with the small sequins and beads. Her delicate makeup is, of course, perfectly coordinated to her gown. A gentle dove rests in her hand."
5,Good value,"The bag is well made for the price. Although the fit is loose for my Vanguard MG3 tripod from Costco, the bag looks good when I wear it over the shoulder.The cross section is 4.5"" X 5"", and it is smallest I could find in the net. And the Cameta camera shipped the bag in timely manner."
5,Excellent wood turning tools!,"Can't say enough good things about PSI wood turning tools. I thought I could get by with just a handful of turning tools, but I still find projects for which I need a different tool. Fortunately, PSI tools are reasonably priced, so I can afford the tools I need. The tools are excellent quality, and they sharpen easily using the grinder jig I made."
4,An Irish Tale,"I would give this movie a 5 for my own personal taste, but I doubt it's a movie everyone would love to watch. The movie is about Irish folk lore and told through the lives of an Irish family. The scenery and music is really nice. We pull it out and watch it once and while and this was an upgrade to dvd from vhs purchase for us."
5,The Secret of Roan Inish,"Want to remember how it feels to believe in what seems impossible but is?Then, this movie is for you. A wonderful story for old and young alike. It is a reminder of the continuous connection of our family linage and how all things move in a circle ... maybe even us!"
3,Okay,I gave this 3 stars because I thought this movie was going to be better than it was. It was slow-moving and there wasn't much excitement. It is a rather strange movie.
3,The demise of Napoleon Bonaparte,"Napoleon's inability to consider the welfare of others during his campaign to rule the world ruined his army; turned supporters against him; and resulted in England's forcing him into seclusion on the Island of Elba.Garbo is Marie Walewska, Napoleon's mistress who gives up her comfortable and respectable life to love Napoleon and give him his first son. She remains faithful to him."
5,Great product,This case works great! The inserts for broadhead is a great feature. I'm using this case with a Darton duel limb bow and it works great!!!
4,HUGE CASE,Not exactly what I was wanting but I guess its functional. Small amount of assembly required. Not too impressed by its quality. Don't pay over 30 bucks for this. There was a sticker inside mine stating 29.99. Guess I got fooled.
5,Reflective country/folk,My dad sent me this CD when I asked him for some good folk/country suggestions. I really enjoyed it. I expected something rough and well `Texas' sounding but this is more like a mix of that and more modern folk. The guy has a great voice and a real talent for song writing. The music is very relaxed and easy to listen too. All in all I would rate this a great CD.
4,Solid Reciever in the midrange to lowrange price,"I've had two years of trouble free operations from the AVR 225. It dosen't have all the bells and whistles and the power is lacking for a midsized room. What it has is 2-opital inputs that can handle the X-box and a DVD player. EZ remote that can automatically adjust your speakers to an acceptable surround sound, some minor adjustments can be made later.DTS and 5.1 channel decodeing is all that is necessary for now. Out of the 400 DVD's I own only 10% has DTS and I have only 2 that has 6.1 channel."
4,good stuff but bad presentation,"Although this is a good product I'm not so happy with the pages that presents it on Amazon.com. The ""technical data"" page contains only the dimensions (yeah that's technical too but I've expected a lot more). For the picture part, I'm really interested in the rear view of the product - if not from the ""technical"" data, I hoped to figure it out from the back side photo but no back photo found :) ...To conclude - maybe someone thinks that the name speaks for itself but for such a price at least you could fill up us with more info to ease the choice - and not let us spending additional time on the net for the needed data..."
1,"Arrogant, Angry and a Re-hash of common sense ideas","Anderson preaches from the right which doesn't make him wrong but he writes with the certainty of the correctness of his ""politically incorrect"" positions. He uses these positions to re-hash some common sense ideas like rewarding performance and hiring competent employees no matter what their race, etc.He could have said what he had to say in half the pages. On the other hand, if you like Rush Limbaugh..."
5,Great book and a real eye opener,"I started reading the book in an Airport terminal, and I couldn't stop! What Dave Anderson has to say is honest, fair and most of all inspiring. This book caters to all, those starting out in the business world like myself, and those retired men and women who have experienced it all. I would definately recommend this book to anyone who wants great advice in their professional life."
3,Christmas With Rosamunde Pilcher,"I am avid fan of Rosamunde Pilcher's books. If you have not read any of her books, I highly recommend Coming Home, Winter Solstice in particular!However, this Christmas book look into her Christmas traditions, receipes, etc. left me unsatisfied. I could not wait to get the book into my hands and then felt somewhat disappointed. Also, the book was fairly expensive for the content contained therein. But, nonetheless, I am happy that it is has found a place amongst the rest of her books I own.Bonnie Abendschoen"
2,Not Jon Anderson's best,"This album is really not much more than some home-recorded tracks and thrown-together songs. Fortunately, Anderson is talented enough to make even a low-production-value album sound good."
5,Our family favorite,"We purchased this toy over a month ago and it has become our family favorite. For our sons ranging in ages 5 - 12 it is easy for each one to play and understand and yet challenging enough for all of us. Directions are simple and you can begin playing right away. The great thing about this toy is that it fits into a plastic box the size of my palm, so I can easily place it in my purse to have as we are waiting for our meal to be served at a restaurant or waiting to see the dentist."
2,U-GOD CAME SHORT WITH THIS ONE!!,"This album is a disgrace to the Wu-Tang Clan and everything it stands for. U-God proves on this album that he is worthless on a track without the rest of the Wu-Tang. After seeing the video for ""Bump"" at 3 in the morning, I thought I was dreaming because I could not believe what I was seeing. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM AND GO PICK UP FISHSCALE. Some advice for U-God: STEP YOUR RAP GAME UP FOR THE NEXT ALBUM!TOP TRACKSIt's A Wrap (Only Good Song Here!)"
2,Very disappointing,"I'm not sure what happened to U-God. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I could not recommend this album to anyone. The beats sound like B-quality leftovers. The choruses were frighteningly bad. Moreover the content of the songs was not memorable. Even guest appearances by the likes of MC Eiht didn't help matters. I hope he looks to polish things up a bit on the next go around. The only reason I won't give it 1 star is because it is still the Wu."
4,Diagrams not included,"Very interesting and informative, but the diagrams are not included, making it a little hard to interpret, as it leans heavily on the diagrams for explanation. Some can be reconstructed from the description, but it makes it difficult to know if you have understood correctly. But hey - it's free so who can complain!"
2,Only for those 'sentimental' soul,I bought this cd out of impulse.Not worth the money as the artist and the songs are without 'substance'.
1,Stay on these Roads [Vinyl] with 2 songs only - not an album,"This item doesn't even deserve a star! Its worthless, and had I known that it has only 2 songs that are extended remix, I would never have ordered it. The other 2 orders, the ""Bob Marley & the Wailers"" are way soothing, but this particular A-ha LP is just garbage. I wish they had informed me that it wasn't the 'Stay on these Roads' Album, so that I could have opted otherwise."
1,Didn't work for me,"I am a fan of the Hair Off Eyebrow Shapers, so when I saw this product from the same brand I didn't hesitate to buy it... that was a mistake. Try as I might, the ""peach fuzz"" on the sides of my face, upper lip, and chin didn't disappear. I threw the remainder of the product away in disgust. I guess it's back to waxing... =oP"
1,I have been punked,This product is totally useless. Used it and it will not even remove peach fuzz. Waste of money. Major disappointment
2,Could be Better,"Love the outburst of flavour. However, very disappointed that the product is made with artificial sweeteners! It would be great if you gave an option to buy this gum with sugar."
4,"Great product, does what it says.","Received my earbuddy with no issues. I have a pair of Skull Candy FMJs. These ear buds were not on sendstation's list but I thought I try it out anyway. The ear buds fit, but not in the same manner as the iPhone ear buds. The ear buds have to fit vertically, nested together and the remote buttons fits along the side with the y-splitter along the top. It is a snug fit, but they still do fit."
1,Unimpressive!,-Shabby construction & disappointing fit. Maybe its a manufacturing issue but all in all does not measure up to the price!! Biggest gripe to me are the looks.+useful key-ring to store your handsfree for the iphone.
3,Small- I can barely squeeze non-Ipod earphones in this,"I thought an earphone is an earphone is an earphone... Well I can barely get the case zipped with my non-Ipod earphones. Maybe Ipod phones work better, but it's tough to get mine to fit :("
2,Irritating,"The book starts off really slowly and then achieves a certain momentum. However, when Frank enters the picture it turns into a boring, offensive, and totally cliche look at sexual relationships. Clara is supposed to be strong but she's just pathetic. I'm angry that I've wasted my time reading this trite junk."
2,Doesn't measure up to the Buddha Bar name,"Biting the bullet, I shelled out an enormous amount of cash for the first two Buddha Bar compilations based on their reputation. That was money well spent and those CDs are incredible.Thus, it was with great anticipation that I ordered Buddha Bar 3. I religiously checked the mailbox every morning and was extremely excited to finally receive it 2 weeks after having ordered it.Alas, although the franchise name ""Buddha Bar"" remains, along with the basic idea of ""world music,"" Ravin does not measure up as a dj against Claude Challe.I found his track selection monotonous, uninspired, and extremely boring. Even the ""Joy"" CD almost put me to sleep.Save your money and spend the extra dough on the first two Buddha Bar CDs. They are well worth the cash."
4,Gold toe men's over the calf,"Nice medium weight sock, true to fit over the calf. After several washings and dryings they have shrunk some and have lost the color. Overall they are great socks and would purchase again"
1,Bad copy,The game was great up until it got stuck on the end of the prison level and you couldn't go further in the game. Ol' dude's supposed to follow you to the parking lot to escape and he wouldn't leave the chapel. So there was no escaping. Gonna get another copy from a different buyer cause I was really enjoying the game and wanna be able to beat it!
4,Very funny,"A comedy about an art-dealer, who will do anything to get sell a Pollack - no matter the price.Well, this is going to forever be known as the 'Madonna' play. I haven't read this to be honest, but I did get to see the play last night, and it was very funny!It was brilliantly written and the only differences I am aware of between the London play and the original book, is that the artists name has been changed and the main character name.If you can't get to see the play (shame on you...) then get the script and see what all the fuss is/was about.Excellent..."
5,"Heartwarming,Suspense,Romance,","I really enjoyed this book, it was a fast read and I couldn't put it down. The Return is a little history, family, suspense, romance, betrayal, power, royalty, Queens, Kings, and exciting. I enjoyed the telling of a story within a story. I visulized my grandfather telling this story giving me history of my roots. The richness of the characters were well developed. ITCOMS book club has selected The Return for the New Millennium. We look forward to David's next book. As a new author the book is well written. Thank you David. In the Spirit!"
2,Not the best work on Stravinsky,"Mr. Walsh's new book on Stravinsky has some interesting anecdotes and insights into the years in America for the composer but seems to lack real relevance historically.What seems to be missing from this new book is any primary sources for his many anecdotes. The Stravinsky estate after his death is a matter of public record in the courts, yet Mr. Walsh has not done the research to get the real facts. Why?There are excellent books by sources much closer to Stravinsky--to say the least Robert Craft's. Craft a twenty year associate of Stravinsky documented just about every waking moment of Stravinsky's life. Referring back to some of Craft's books on Stravinsky I find that Walsh has lifted numerous writings from Craft rather than bringing anything of real interest to life for the reader.I have to say, this book is not the best work on Stravinsky and I hope other readers will go to better sources for a cohesive and cogent telling of Stravinsky's life and career."
3,...showing its age,"Pretty cool album when it first came out. But unlike The Blue Mask, Berlin, and Street Hassle this one is showing its age. Basically it is liberal dogma from the mid-80's set to a rock and roll beat. Not that dogma is necessarily a bad thing. But getting hit over the head with it shows (gasp) a lack of true creativity. Sorry Lou."
5,Simply Sublime,"I had heard ""Walk On the Wild Side"" with my father as a child, and although there were lyrics there at the time I didn't fully understand, the song made a significant impact. I saw ""New York"" in a record (there were still a few) store when it was released and decided to buy it (I was 12). This album touched me then, as it does now. In different ways, to be sure. I have matured and can understand more fully the depth of this music I could only bearly appreciate as a younger boy. Where has this kind of heart-felt, lyric rich, desperate yet hopeful music gone? Very few musicians, or people in general, obtain a mastery of language as Lou Reed has. His ability to convey thought and emotion while both telling a story and making a commentary on the Human Condition is awe inspiring and motivating. When I have lost hope in Humankind I put on Lou Reed. I would give my right arm to make art like this. This is what redeems us all."
3,"with the air stud in, the gun does not fit!!","Well, I have to say, although it is good to have a plastic case for my prized framing nailer, I certainly wish it fit with the 1/4 NPT stud attached. I also have a 3/8 to 1/4 NTP converter, so it might fit with just a 3/8 stud. Either way, my Senco brad and staplers all fit with the stud attached. It just needs to be a 1/2 wider!"
5,Awesome Management Tool,"Everyone, especially those in management, should read this book. We all deal with conflict and learning these few simple ""no-brainer"" tips will make it less stressful. It's not enough to know what you are talking about...you need to know who you are talking to."
5,Good Book on Conflict Resolution,"This book is more for people that struggle with confronting conflicts. I am fine with confronting conflict, so it just gave me a look into have those people feel."
4,Humorous yet on the mark in many cases,"Given all our friends and family and business associates interactions, seeing some decent accuracy in these astrology write-ups. There are off course exceptions, but when she's right, it is amazingly accurate, such as good relationships / interaction between boar, sheep and rabbit. Some maybe situational, self-fulfilling prophecies, but in our sample size it is delightful to see the horoscopes matching to observed interactions (both positive and negative). I don't read too much into these and find it entertaining book. I think everyone has some elements of all these pieces, and very entertaining to read through the descriptions and match them up to folks we know well and sometimes coincidentally enlightening for our family."
5,Oldman's Gude to Outsmarting Wine - an Indispensable Resource,"While other wine books are informative - they can often seem patrician and preachy.Mark Oldman doesn't ""hide the ball"" when it comes to providing advice on wine. He is on your side and helps to inform and educate without the lecture.Through his great breadth and depth of wine knowledge, humor and wit, you'll enjoy every page.His volume is an indispensable resource for helping you mix and match wines with the foods that bring out the best in both.Highly recommend."
5,very much recommended,"You only have to search the internet to find how many fans this new book already has. The Oldman's Guide is riotously funny and very helpful, like a stylish friend who comes to visit for the weekend and leaves you much smarter for it . One of my favourite sections details ordering wine in restaurants. These chapters have entirely renovated how I handle monster wine lists and conduct my wine purchasing. At the book's core is the keenest treatment of wine appreciation, and how to get the best of it, that I've encountered thus far."
5,I loved it!!,the vhs was in very good shape when it arrived. Enjoyed it very much it was like having the Goodman's in my home. Thank you Amazon!!
3,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,I purchased this set for my Jet 1442 wood lathe and I will review the most important aspects of these tools.1. overall finish of the tools are rough and gritty. Tolorances are not real high...2. Bearing in the live center is gritty as if the bearing grease is contaminated with chips or sand..3. Bearing tolarence is average to poor. Grease seems to be too light.3. Center pin in the live center is not removable..4. Small live center has no center pin at all..5. One reviewer wrote that the units were hollow and the drift rod got stuck in the hole. I found this not to be the case as my standard drift rod was larger than the holes.You get what you pay for....overall I give this unit 4 stars for the price.....If I disregard the price I give this unit 2 stars...mainly because of the drive spurs
1,extremely cheap quality,"I didn't purchase these on Amazon. I bought them directly from the manufacturer about six years ago. Despite being used gently (I don't hammer them into the blank), the metal on these deformed and chipped very badly. They have a whole lot of runout as well. The steel on them seems as if it was never hardened, to be honest. There are much better quality cheap Chinese centers to be found (probably even on this site). I probably should have asked for a refund."
1,What was this?,"See 'pixiedust4u' Spotlight review. It is accurate and hits every point I could make.I could write a book about how awful this movie was, although I enjoyed the acting. But, why should I waste more of my time. On the List of Best Known and Appreciated Actors in a Horrible Film, this should hold #1 spot for a long while."
1,so very very very very very very bad,I had the unfortunate chance to see this movie and it was so horrible this is a movie that has little or no story and is so pitful that not only couldn't I finish it but I had to write a review for it. First of all it is pop garbage in which everything always endes up happy and has nothing to do with reality in any way. Besides this (because a movie can be good w/ these qualities if it is funny) is not a romantic comedy it is a romantic that's it it's not a drama it's nothing. Last itis w. richard here who left the thriller scene to do these horrible movies. Face it u got lucky w/ pretty woman that's all you'll ever get. Don't c this movie.
1,Amazingly bad,"To look at the previews of this movie, one would expect either an amazing look into the female psyche, or at least a romantic comedy. Instead the viewer is treated to two hours of disjointed dialogue, bizarre plot twists, and a complete cast of unlikable characters (despite almost everyone of them being played by world class actors and actresses). I have never written a review before, but after watching this movie I needed some way to lash out at having wasted two hours hoping the movie would redeem itself with a proper ending, however, I was grossly disappointed in that also. The only lessons that can be taken away from this bizarre film are beware casts of big name actors and never believe the back of a DVD case."
1,Just Plain Despicable,"This may be the worst movie ever filmed. Its portrayal of women borders on the misogynistic, even though the lead character, Dr. T, is alleged to love women--his wife too much, even. The symbolism has all the subtlety of being beat about the head with a bat: It's a twister, get it? His life is in turmoil! The plot is disjointed and that ending... boy, is it bad. At first you think the screenwriter just gave up, but then you suspect perhaps he ingested hallucinogens.Some bad movies redeem themselves by being laughable. This one, as another reviewer pointed out, just makes you hate it."
1,Not good,"I wonder why Richard Gere accepts these roles in movies with no plots and sense. I just watched on TV because there was nothing better, I can't belive that actresses like Liv Tyler are on these movies, she has talent to make better movies. I want somebody to explain me the movie."
1,"This one needs a ""zero"" stars rating","I wish I could get my money back. I also wish I could get back the nearly two hours of my life wasted watching this piece of garbage.This is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Don't get suckered in by the talented cast and glowing ""critical"" reviews. Yes, the cast is talented, but that talent is wasted in this worthless excuse for a movie.It's boring--plain and simple. And why any women would like it is beyond me after the way the movie portrays women. It didn't redeem itself at the ending either--it was as totally ridiculous as the rest of the movie. The low point of the whole movie was the role assigned to Frrah Fawcett. It was especially painful to watch her totally absurd role."
1,Dr. T & The Women DVD,"This is a terrible movie. How could so many stars be associated with such a lousy film? Maybe it should have been ""Mr. T"" rather than ""Dr. T"" as that would have been more entertaining. Even the bargain price was far too much to pay for this disaster of a story line that made little sense. I think Kate Hudson ran off with her lesbian maid-of-honor just to get out of this movie."
1,Stupid Movie!,OMG!I can't believe I actually rented this stupid movie I couldn't wait it'll end.The story line was dull and stupid. Richard gere is Dr.Sullivan Travis a gyncolgist and he is married to kate (Farrah Fawcett) who got probably a breakdown and i9s in phsycatry instute because her husband loved her 2 much they have 2 daughters connie (tara reid) who I must say did the best prformence and dee dee (kate hudson) liv tyler is the lesbien lover of dee dee her name is marlyien (liv tyler did an horrible acting) and bree (helen hunt) is a golf assitent that dr.t falls in love with.This movie is stupid don't go watch it there are MUCH better movies!
2,It Could Have Been Better,"Casual browsers at the video store will likely be drawn to this movie by its outstanding cast, however with the exception of some good scenes in the waiting room, this film fails to deliver. I did watch it all the way through, wondering where it was going. As many of the supporting rolls were performed by interesting actors, I was hoping to see more development but was left hanging. The ending is really disappointing it just runs out of gas. It was like the film makers did not know how to end it and they just winged it. I was just as confused as Richard Gere in the wedding scene. Whats going on here?"
1,You can't give 0 stars?,"This movie is proof that even Richard Gere can't save a horrible movie. Dr. T is a busy, sought-after doctor in Dallas ... a doctor (the lucky kind were told early on) married to a wacko (played by Farrah Faucett... what a stretch is that?) who he is accused of giving a complex because he ""loves her too much."" If that's not bad enough, the plot thins with wedding plans of one daughter we learn is a lesbian and another who is played by Tara Reid... enough said. He's in the midst of a fling with Helen Hunt who must have a quota of crappy movies to make in a single year. Just when you thought this movie could bite no more, he drives his convertible into a tornado and lands in Mexico in time to deliver (we get to see a live birth) a baby. Save your time and money here"
2,A Sub-Par Film for Altman,"With such a talented cast and a semi-decent story, you think it would have been a great movie. Richard Gere plays a gynecologist in a large Texas town. His life is on the down side and he is close to having a nervous breakdown. His wife is going crazy. One of his daughters might be a lesbian and the other is just mean. He doesn't know what to do. That's when golf pro Helen Hunt moves to town and he is immediately infatuated with her. I love Robert Altman. He is a great story teller, but there was something missing from this film. If you truly love Altman, then take the time to watch it...if you normally don't, then you might want to steer clear from it."
1,"SCARY, it's so bad!!","I couldn't believe how unattractive every character was, how vapid the storyline, and how much I couldn't bring myself to care about ANY of these repulsive people. Altman chose to highlight the ugliest side of human nature relentlessly over 2 hours. Spare yourself the agony!"
2,Worst movie ever... don't miss it,"This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. ""Why didn't she turn it off?"" you might ask. It was so bad that I thought it couldn't possibly get any worse, so I kept watching it.An aging Farrah Faucet, jumping around in a fountain, does not make good movie fodder.The ending was so ridiculous as to be funny. If you watch this movie with tongue in cheek, you might enjoy it."
3,Has Problems,"I was initially very impressed by the image quality. However, as time went on, I first noticed the problem where the image would get distored at the bottom part of the screen. When the Toshiba approved repair technician looked at it, he replace an integrated circuit card. However, after he did that, characters are not getting displayed properly. They look fuzzy (as though you are not wearing your prescription eye glasses). The color and picture quality are excellent. The TV is very heavy and thereore I strongly urge you to buy the in-home service warranty. Trust me you will need this.Overall, I think that I good have bought a better TV."
1,JVC tech admits product is not compatible with sony or canon,"They will however, blame it on sony and canon and insist they are right. I was told to go buy JVC camcorders to make it work right. I use a TRV 900 and a Canon XL1s , my tapes play fine out of cameras but i cant use JVC deck to do anything mini dv because it introduces glitches and dropped frames into video.They know this is a problem and dont have any solutions for it. When I call they come up with ways to tell me Im using the product wrong. They have had my deck and sample tapes I provided them for over a month and havent decided what to do."
1,Flawed tool,"I have both the Accuset brad nailer and 1/4"" crown nailer. They have both failed do to the driver piston not retracting fully, thus not firing the next fastener in the clip. In additon , all of the screw fasteners on the tools were over torqued from the factory, and some could not be removed for servicing without stripping. The tools are also heavy compared to the competition. Not recommended."
2,kind of thin,"We have installed these filters on our ceiling fan, and I noticed that 2 of the filters have not stuck very well, so they are kind of flopping around when the blades are turning. They have not fallen off yet but I'm sure in time they will. So, one of the features I am not very happy about, is this. The other one, is that these filters are half the thickness of my previous filters, and I am not sure how effective they are. When we removed the previous filters, there was quite a bit of dust and gunk on them. So, they were effectively removing some pollution from the air. Next time I will try to find something better."
2,"An autobiography of her ""wonderful"" self",Like her other book I also listened to the audio book. As the other one her voice is just a headache!She explains of how wonderful she is on and on and on... with some spices here and there about some tiny mistakes!!It is still a book worth reading IF you have a lot of time...
3,ANNOYING,"i made the mistake of listening to an audio of this book. Some parts of it were helpful. But unfortunately, the author chose to read the book herself. Picture your first grade energetic teacher reading little children a book with all the inflection and phony excitement that we've all heard. It is very Ironic that she didn't have the self awareness to realize how annoying her reading method was to an adult."
2,Boring.,"all her other books are interesting, but not this one. lowdnes.com is a sales pitch site. no valuable info there other than ordering new copies of her books."
4,Not their best but still better than most,"I found it at a flea market in cassette form (why would anyone sell it?) and it took about 4 plays before I was hooked. Not the Mat's best album (see Tim, Pleased to Meet Me, Let It Be) but still has some real winners on it. Talent Show has that great ending chorus of ""It's too late to turn back, here we go!""; Achin' To Be just sets me down soft and sad; soaring to the sky with Darlin' One.Mostly ballads and some rockers but all with those strong Westerberg lyrics (that man can certainly turn a phrase). No real filler here just some tunes are better than others. Still, this album is better than what other bands will put out in their lifetimes."
4,Beautiful Tropics,"I've been asked to make a comment regarding my purchase. I have to say that I did not enjoy this series as much as the first, which is more instructional. I guess I just can't imagine myself sitting on the beach waiting for the sun to come up and start exercising. Thank goodness some of the participants were older and had a little more meat on them. I identified. Still, the series is beautifully prepared and I don't regret buying it."
3,"Good, but not great","I bought this book thinking it would have lots of, what I thought were ""common,"" recipes to pick from. There's lots of recipes, but they're just.....different. The instructions are detailed with decent photos and there's plenty of interesting pieces to make in the artistic section."
5,Well thought out and enjoyable,"I believe that this is a wonderful book for anyone who has ever wondered what happened to the dinosaurs. Being raised a Christian, but never receiving an adequate answer to the fossils, I had always wondered. I think that this book is right on with it's teaching and is simple and enjoyable enough for anyone to read. I would have loved to come across this book while growing up. I searched the library left and right to discover information such as this has and never came across a book that presents information and ideas like this. I consider it a very good book to add to one's library."
5,"Excellent CD; in Spanish, using only acoustic instruments.","The songs on this recording are traditional Mexican canciones played on traditional Mexican acoustic instruments such as the guitarra, requinto, guitarron, vihuela, tololoche, acordeon, and violin. Each song's verses are printed in the liner notes in Spanish and in English. Very good."
3,Good - but not great.,"It's hard to say why, but this one just did not seem all that great - just ok."
5,No comparison,"I own the SFN40K and just purchased a second one, Senco Finish pro 35 and they are the greatest. Light weight, no jam ups. Adjustable exhaust is also nice feature.Purchased a Master Fastner 15 gauge nailer last year. Unbelievable, never worked, Woodworkers Warehouse stopped selling them and Master of course left no fowarding address or telephone number. Must have sailed away on the boat named""Crooks Ahoy."""
5,A Great TV!,"I did alot of research on TVs before buying this one. The only weak spot this TV has is no volume leveler and that's it. I've had mine for about a year and I'm very, very happy with its performance. For the money, there isn't a better TV out there!"
5,This is the BEST bruch out there,"i have heard over 20 different recordings of Bruch violin concerto No.1. i strongly recommend this recording to anyone. this is the best out there. no kidding. i put this in #1 spot where oistrakh's recording also belongs to. Those 2 recordings are different and both excellent. IF YOU LIKE THIS PEICE, YOU HAVE TO LISTEN THIS."
2,Should change the title,"to ArcExplorer for everyone.The book is a great introduction for those who want to have a more or less thorough tour of what a GIS is capable of. Being an ESRI press book, it was more or less obvious that its only approach was goin to be through ESRI products (ie. ArcExplorer)Anyway, the book only shows what can be done with the already processed, already ""ArcMade"" datafiles. It fails to explain anything else of the GIS creation process.If you're looking for a technical book, forget it."
2,No Good,"Not only this tape takes away the paint, it did little to nothing in stopping the draft from coming in. Bummer"
4,Would buy again next season,I used this tape and the shrink plastic over my windows hoping to save on heating bills. The bills are still high but I think these products help. My partner says its all in my head. Next year I'll just get these since they seem to adhere to the aluminum window frame. There's no actual glue on the tape so even when there's condensation the tape remains in place.
2,I felt ripped off!,"Scotch tape would have done the same thing and been much less expensive!! It functions properly but packing tape, which many people have, would have done the same thing."
3,Fell Short,"I don't claim to be a scholar ('cuz I'm not), but I know the book left out one thing I was looking for; a detailed account of Dick Crookback's demise. This was only glossed over by a line or two. Otherwise, there are some good images of actual reference material (i.e. pics of armor, effigies, period paintings, etc). Turner obviously has a mastery of depicting arms and armor, and has a nice out-of-doors look to his paintings, but I was a bit nonplussed at his portrayal of fighting men in action. They all look way too nonchalant, even when swinging a pole-axe, or as cavalry about to meet head-on."
2,A Vague Account of a Minor Dynastic Skirmish,"This is not one of the better of the Osprey Campaign series. The biggest weakness is the absence of detailed historical facts about the course of the 1485 Bosworth campaign, which encourages the author to extrapolate from a handful of facts. When the author depicts three possible different locations on the battle maps for the vital contingents of the Stanleys, it only serves to reinforce the vagueness of detail available on this battle. The actual fighting is covered in less than 10 pages out of 95. Furthermore, why a brief dynastic skirmish of a handful of Englishmen in the 15th Century merits a campaign title is never convincingly explained. There is very little actual detail throughout and this is further diminished by a writing style that moves at a sluggish pace. Information on order of battle and casualties is negligible. This is the kind of book that makes one want to read French, not English, history."
2,Strictly for horror fans,"Maybe it is because I am not a horror film fan that I don't like this film. Though I must say that if this is the state of the art, then I have no desire to be a horror film fan.I have noticed that old and specialized films always get high rates on Amazon, surely because only real fans buy them and rate them. This has the downside that some non-fans will be convinced that the film is really a classic and excellent film, and not just a fan cornerstone.Dawn of the Dead starts without a beginning, there is no introduction to the setting, the story, or the characters. It is so confusing that I had to go back to see if I missed a chapter. It also has mediocre acting, mediocre make-up and effects, and a mediocre story. I strongly suspect that it has been so influential solely because it was *first* with something or other, not because of ultimate quality."
4,More Than I Expected,"First off, I gave this DVD four stars instead of five just because I too know a more expanded version is to be released later this year. But that fact aside, I still think this DVD is a good buy.Now I've read a few reviews going on (negatively) about how this is the theatrical version of the film and that the Director's Cut is better. Well, it's only better if you like a bunch of excess, and to me, really boring dialog. When I brought the video tape of it (the Director's Cut), I was expecting to see an extra 20 minutes of gore, but except for just one cool scene, it was all dialog. Dialog, that in my opinion, that didn't add a thing to it. In fact, this twenty minutes reminds of the outtakes from Jaws. I was glad they were taken out.George Romero has said that the Theatrical Cut of the film is his favorite. And I'm glad it's the one on this DVD."
5,THE Greatest Horror Film ever made.,This film is the standard for Horror Films.George Romereo's Dead films will be re-released this year! VERY COOL.New film projects are shortly arriving and and fans have been waiting!
3,"Not his best, but still a great George Romero film","The basic storyline of this film is great~the world has become almost completely over-run with the walking dead, there's havoc everywhere, and 3 of the last survivors decide to hold themselves up in of all places~a mall. Although i can definitely see why to many this is they're favorite of the three Dead films, i would have to say i still think that the final film ""Day Of The Dead"" is much better, not only acting wise, but i have to admit i found Dawn a bit slow moving (it comes in at over 2 hrs)as well. But i did appreciate the humor and irony of the story. i also have always loved how Romero has a group of actors that always seem to pop up in all of his movies ~his wife Christina Forrest, special effects wiz Tom Savini & my personal fave cameo~tho he's only on screen for about 30 seconds in this~John Amplas (who stared in my all-time favorite Romero film, ""Martin"" )among others."
3,Do not get this edition yet!!!,"I love George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead. It wasn't scary in today's standard but I respect that he had made a standard for the movie during late 1960s. Now with the sequel to it, Dawn of the Dead: Special Edition from Anchor Bay has finally arrived. With tv spots, movie trailers and a few more others included.BUT WAIT!After I bought this a few months back, I have conceived a fact that I regret buying this edition - DAWN OF THE DEAD: THE ULTIMATE EDITION is releasing in September!And it's a director's cut, with lots of special features that is almost 11 hours! Plus a booklet to this limited edition.Now, although I have the special edition, I have to sell it in order to buy the upcoming edition, which has more additions to the movie. So beware!"
2,See Night of the Living Dead Instead...,"This movie is silly. It's often boring, while the gore is comic, the zombies are as blue as smurfs and there isn't a scary moment in it. I totally recommend Night of the Living Dead, which is a quintessential horror film that is effectively creepy... Dawn of the Dead is just camp."
1,A Yawn for the Dawn of the dead,"I rented the director's cut VHS because I heard they are coming out with a remake in 2004. I never saw the Dawn of the Dead until a few days ago, so I felt I had to see the original before I saw the remake. Many fans of this movie were complaining because they don't want to see a remake, but I say bring it on because you can't go anywhere but UP with a remake for this movie. The dialog was as awful as the characters. The movie started off slow, bad make-up job on the zombies, typical falling on the ground and making bad decisions that make you want to groan and shake your head. I realize this is an old movie and that is why I said bring on the remake and put some of these Creative minds, great make-up artists and technology (special effects) to work. I looove horror movies and this movie wasn't scary AT ALL. Highly laughable, very slow, but not scary. For anyone who hasn't already seen this movie wait for the remake because you aren't missing much."
4,Well worth watching!,"Altough the movie starts out slow, and within the first 15 minutes you wonder if you are going to see any zombies, it is a great movie about the world being taken over by the living dead. After watchinf Romero's Night of the Living Dead I had to watch the sequels. Now that I have seen this movie I can't wait to see Day of the dead, the las t film in Romero's trilogy."
4,AWSOME!!,"This movie is sweet. Tons of Action, terror, gore,humor and a good political message. Gorge A remaro is a genius and you are not a true horror fan if this ones not in your colletion."
5,Is Goblin's music all there?,"Does anyone know if the Goblin music is included as a stand-alone playable score like in the triple Suspiria DVD, NOT simply as the backing music for the Argento cut? In other words, like the CD -- something I can listen to independent from watching the film, with no dialogue or effects. Please tell me!"
4,The Greatest Sequel Ever!,"People usually say that sequels ruin the original look of the first films. But this movie is way better than 'Night of the Living Dead'. This movie scared me when I was about five, and again, when I was ten.This review may not be much, but rent 'Dawn of the Dead' anyway. You won't be displeased. I promise."
1,The goriest movie I've ever seen,"...and also, one of the worst horror films I've ever seen. It is NOT scary or terrifying at all! It's just stupid, sick, violent, and gory. All the gore effects are there for the sake of viewers wanting to see some zombie action. There are almost no characters you get to know or care about, or even something worth remembering. It's just like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", only this is much worse."
4,Nice transfer,"Any true Romero Zombie fan who has entered the HD age MUST have this so reviews will mean little in their buying decision. Thankfully the transfer is very nice and sharp, obviously they pulled a fresh print so the source for it is solid. This is not a movie that is terribly demanding on your sound system so nothing much to say with regards to the audio. If this review seems kind of ""eh"" I guess it's just because there is nothing astounding here either pro and con. It fully met expectations and did not dissapoint."
4,BEST ZOMBIE MOVIE EVER!!,Dawn of the Dead is an awesome film. I am not gonna spoil the story for new comers But I can say this movie is awsome. I saw this film when I was 9 and thought it was good but when I rented it a few months ago I was wrong!This movie is awsome as hell. I thought the story was great.The actors were good too. One seen with a bunch of little kids grabbing on to the cop dude was funny as hell! Gearg A. Romero is a great film director and I absolutly want him to make DEAD RECKINING. THIS MOVIE RULESThe film is a little slow paced. The action is great! The film has lots of gore. Trust me. The ending with the gang memebers was sick but some what funny. This film is great! Its on my top 10 list for best films of all time!GET IT!
2,Cheesy make-up and special effects,Don't waste your time with this one. The original Night of the Living Dead was more enjoyable. And to think it took Romero almost a decade to make this sequel. Skip right to Day of the Dead.
5,BEST MOVIE OF THE TYPE EVER MADE,"THE MOVIE IS SPINE TINGLING ENTERTAINMENT FROM THE BEGINNING TILL THE END, IT FEATURES SOME FINE ACTING BY THE LEAD SWAT CHARACTERS AND A GREAT SUPPORTING CAST. THE ZOMBIES ARE A LITLLE UNREALISTIC BUT THE MOVIE IS OLD AND EFFECTS HAVE IMPROVED SO MUCH THAT WE ARE A LITTLE SPOILED BUT THE OLD FASHION GOOD SCRIPT IS THERE. THE STORY MAKES SOME SENSE AND THE PLOT IS ENGAGING AND MANAGES TO MAKE THE VIEWER TRULY INTERESTED IN THE CHARACTERS..IT IS A MUST HAVE MOVIE FOR ANY HORROR FAN-A RARE MOVIE THAT TOPS EVEN THE FINE ORIGINAL FILM.THIS MOVIE REMADE TODAY WOUDLD BECOME AN INSTANT BLOCKBUSTER."
1,Super Quiet,"Our humidifier is superquiet, but then again so are most things I own that don't work at all. The fan worked for a week, then died. Basically, I have moldy water wicks and a non-operative fan/motor. Ours could be the rare lemon, but ours is going back."
1,Vornado Humidifier Not Effective,"Here in California, it gets very dry in the winter months, as most everywhere else when the furnaces kick in. The humidity in my home was often 25 to 35 percent. Too low. I tried the Vornado cold-water humidifier from Amazon. Unfortunately, though it was rated for 1,000 sq. feet of roomspace, it couldn't raise the humidity of my office by more than 5%. I sent it back. If you want a cold-water humidifier, you'd better buy one that is HUGE, like the ones Sears sells. Like the size of an evaporative cooler, which is what it is. Otherwise, the best way to go is a steam-producing humidifier i.e. vaporizer.. Get one with the largest water-capacity you can. I found one sold on Amazon for about $40, and it works great. The ultrasonic models aren't very good either, as they leave a white powder residue everywhere in the room."
3,Think Twice if You Have Well Water,"We've ran this unit about 2 months now and it does a pretty good job of humudifying our 1000-foot-plus upstairs.However, we have well water, a LITTLE on the hard side. So we have to rinse the filters in vinegar water frequently when they harden from the mineral deposits. But that only works a few times, then the filters have to be replaced.So my problem with this unit coincides with most other reviewerss: It's EXPENSIVE to run. Will cost us at least $.../month for replacement filters."
3,it cools the house down,"In the winter the last thing I need is something making the house colder. It also seems to take a long time (two days?) to use up all its water, and we have a relative humidity below 25% most of the time."
1,Terrible - works well as a mold grower,This is the worst humidifer ever. Basically a pan of water with a fan. It doesn't humidify well and the wicks end up covered in mold. Stay away!
5,Great little radio,I wanted a pocket radio so I could listen to AM stations while doing yard work and home repairs. This one is great! The belt clip is super handy and it allows the radio to be turned (so you can look at the display) without unclipping it. I haven't used the earphones because the speaker is all I need. I was really surprised at the sound quality. The digital tuning and preset stations are a big plus and there is a lock button; if you accidentially hit one of the buttons they are locked and will not change. I relied on the reviews on Amazon to make my decision and appreciate everyone's input.
1,disappointed,"You would think a radio would be something that would be mastered by now. We can use drones against our enemies, but can't build a radio that comes in clear."
3,Almost excellent,"Sounds is quite good. Needs better antenna system, headset is very weak for sound and other headsets weak on antenna function."
5,Exactly What I Needed,"Good reception. Good speaker. Easy on batteries. Fits in shirt pocket. Once you figure out how all the buttons work, it is easy to use."
3,Miss old fashion radios,This radio is just fine. But I like to fine tune on a dial and those are hard to find anymore.Plus I live in a very rural area . I may get two am stations clearly if I'm lucky.Maybe I should move because I love listening to the radio in bed.The unit itself is fine. Simple to use .
1,on/off button problem,"This radio is great, but until the button problems are corrected I do not recommend.DBS button failed within 3 months and the on/off button failed in four months."
1,Sangean DT-210,"Difficult to give a meaningful review as the radio only lasted a week and a half before failing - all functions failed, screen went black. Changing batteries had no effect and the radio was returned for a refund from Amazon (which acted promptly)."
2,Disappointed in radio,"Purchased radio 2 years ago. Reception poor, can only get one local station at night, which is when I listen to it to fall asleep at night. Can get another station during the day and I live about 20 miles north of the city. Batteries run out every 2 weeks. Feature that shuts off radio in 90 minutes has stopped working, so batteries last only 2-3 days if I don't wake up to shut it. Difficult to program, can never get that function to work. Right tuning key has lost power to go that direction. Would not purchase another, couldn't find a company number to call them when I needed help in programing the 2 stations I can get. Will not purchase another of this brand."
4,Nice little Radio,"I listen to am talk radio shows at night and needed a little radio. I really like this radio, I don't notice much difference in my other cheap radio in terms of tuining into usually low signal or far off am stations as I was hoping for. The preset is annoying because you have to hit the button again after a few seconds or it forgets you are using preset stations.But overall, a very nice little radio for the price."
5,Radio as walking companion,I take this radio with me on daily walks. It fits in a jacket or pants pocket easily. The ear buds are comfortable with clear audio that doesn't block too much traffic noise to be dangerous. Low battery strength shuts off the radio to preserve settings during battery replacement. All the features are easy to use. I like having the TV audio option although I don't use it as much as the AM (talk) radio. I'm glad I purchased this product from Amazon.
2,not all it's hyped to be,"I was looking for a small radio to pull in a.m. sports talk programming, and after reading the other reviews, I was sold on the Sangean unit. I was disappointed to find that the a.m. reception was every bit as inadequate as a five dollar cheapo.I have since returned it and upgraded to the xm satellite myfi unit. XM may cost a good deal more, but the results are well worth it."
4,...but my earholes aren't that big,"I bought this radio for work. I'd been using a little Sony for 10 years or so and wanted digital tuning. It's a nice little radio, but for two things.Wearing it on my belt, it's prone to bumping, which changes the tuning or the band. Maybe a case would help. Also, the ear buds were not made for my ears, which I heretofore had considered to be of a normal size.Oh, well. I still like it, particularly for the price I paid."
3,One Concern,"I love this little radio, it's got great AM reception. It has a lock button, so you can stay on your station or keep from accidentally turning it on. Sadly, it lasted only four months before that button stopped working while it was in the lock position. Now I can't get to turn on. I'm just weeks past the 90 day guarantee."
4,As good as i had hoped!,"I bought this as a gold box offer and am happy for it. This little guy keeps a solid connection in Chicago's downtown which is notorious for interference due to a few ""tall"" buildings here and there.I can get AM/FM and TV in the Loop without sounding like it's being broadcast from a cave in Mongolia.Worth every dime. It loses a star only because you have to manually scan for your presets. Nothing I can't live with though."
5,Great radio for walkers and people who work outside!,I have had this radio for several months now and I love it. There are so many great features on this radio. The sound this thing puts out for the size is just amazing. The digital tuning is great and the hold button really helps since the tuning buttons are the front and can easily hit by accident(especially when in shirt pocket). I have listened with head phones(supplied) occasionally and stereo sounds great but 99.9% of the time I use the speaker and keep in shirt pocket. This unit is so light you really will forget it is there. It is also surprisingly durable(dropped numerous times on pavement and tile and still works great).If you love to listen to the radio everywhere this is the radio for you. One piece of advice-get 4 AAA rechargable batteries and keep one set on charge and one set in the radio and you'll always be able to listen and you will save money.
1,Terrible -- Cannot Pick Up Station Inside or Outside,"I purchased this radio because it had a digital tuner. I listen to talk radio and the news when I walk or ride my bike. This radio will not even pick up the local station that I listen to. When I first got it, I thought it was because I was in the house. Today I took it outside on my afternoon walk. Nothing but static and blasts of music/talking from other stations. I tuned up a hair and then down. Static. I switched it to AM and then back to FM. Static. This radio is not recommended and is going back."
4,Great Product for Good Price,"This radio is a great buy. It is very small and lightweight, and the reception for both AM and FM were fantastic. The AM band was especially important because it will be used mostly at sporting events. The screen is nice and big, and the tuning is easy and accurate. I really like that it has an external speaker as well, so you can listen even if you don't have any headphones. The packaged earbuds aren't that bad in my opinion, but they don't stay in your ear all that well. You may want to consider buying your own headphones or earbuds. My negative, however, is that the belt clip definitely did not fit in the radio. I tried and tried to get it to click in place and it would not stay. I think the clip piece may have been defective. Great radio otherwise."
1,"Worst radio, worst company","Terrible static and station-skip for the FM (NPR) stations I listen to, while walking my dog, even though both stations' translators are within sight-distance, and only 10 to 15 miles distant. Sanjean ""Customer Service"" nonexistent, despite my many emails and letters. Amazon Customer Service unresponsive & unhelpful. Finally I replaced radio with Sanjean DT-400 (at my own full expense), which has greater power and works fine, although my previous DT-400 died a horrible death shortly after its 1st birthday. Note: my dog does not care whether or not I can listen to All Things Considered."
4,works well,This product works as advertised. The antenna and earphone also works well. I just hope that when tv becomes digital next year that I will still be able to get the tv stations.
1,sellers actions: Fog-Ware.com,"purchased the product 1/22/2011 and used it for a year, computer crashed and contacted for-ware.com to re validate mymy licenses since i also purchased the additional dictionaries at 20.00 each. the seller will not re validate my licenses after a reinstall.I recommend not purchasing this product since you will be throwing away your money and fog ware will not respond to your request to re-validate licenses."
4,A very nice product; but doesn't integrate with browsers.,"This is undoubtedly the best dictionary & thesaurus available today. The features that impressed me the most are:1: You don't have to leave the CD in the drive to use the 'pronounciation' feature. You can optionally install the sound files on your hard disk. (Approx. 532 MB)2: Multiple pronounciations invoked where appropriate.3: Installs without a glitch and integrates with MS Word.4: Has a lot of nice features like 'Spelling Help'.I hope the 12th Edition will integrate with email browsers, not just with MS Word. Also, I would have preferred the thesaurus invoked automatically in an additional pane instead of switching between dictionary and thesaurus."
1,Too Small,High quality material just could not stretc) over my husband's shoes. The sizing doesn't allow for the stretch neccary to go over shoes.
4,solid,these rubbers will definitely do the job of protecting your shoes from rain. they look to be well made and should last for quite a few seasons. size seems to be for a width e rather than d but still comfortable. delivery was earlier than date stated.
4,"Good galoshes, poorly sized","I've used Tingley overshoes for years and like them. I suppose a criticism is that they're slippery, but all overshoes are--there's no easy way to put cleats in something floppy. A bigger criticism, though, is that they've changed their sizing. I used to wear size large and now I wear size medium, over exactly the same shoes (43N Birkenstock Arizonas)--a fairly annoying change when buying by mail."
2,Sizing Problem,"After reading the reviews regarding sizing problems, I decided to call Tingley directly before ordering the overshoes. I was told by the Tingley rep that I would need a size Large overshoe to fit my size 11 1/2 sneaker. However, the Large was too small, so I had to send the overshoe back and order a size Extra Large. For some reason, the Extra Large was sold by a different vendor than the one that sold the Large. The vendor for the Extra Large did not qualify for Prime shipping, so I now have to wait about 10 days to receive the replacement overshoe."
5,Size was off,Had to return this because of the size difference but absolutely no problem with the return and getting my money back. I wish they made this a bit smaller for small feet
5,Outstanding Galoshes,I cannot say enough positive things about the high quality of these galoshes. They are well made / have great traction/ and I can see that I will be using them a lot.
4,this is not pink floyd,this is nbot a pink floyd concert .. this is only roger water at the wall in berlin and you can find it at 9.99 in walmart or any other place this guy is selling if the concert was pink floyd but is not is only roger water .. please don't buy the disc for him his a lier ...
4,so far no issues with this...,"I bought this because I was looking for a playpen that didn't have a bassinet/changing station since my son is already 10+ months old. I wanted a decent size one without all the infant-related ""attachments"" and that's exactly what this is. It's a good size, plenty of room for my now 11 month old baby to play around in. It was easy to set up, and easy to move around the house. I haven't taken it down yet, though, or tried to put it back in the storage bag. The ""mattress"" that it comes with is rather thin, but I got a playard pad to put under the fitted sheet that I bought and that gives it a bit more cushioning. My baby doesn't seem to mind being in it for short period of times and I like that it has 2 solid ends and 2 mesh sides, because he gets distracted sometimes if he sees me. The gray one is a subdued color scheme, just what I wanted.So if you are looking for a simple, good sized and well priced playard, this is what you need. I would recommend it."
1,Don't Bother,"Ordered this to use for twins as they grow because it was the largest play yard I could find. Reviews indicated it was easy to use. I unpacked it and attempted to set it up. Broke out into a sweat trying to get the sides to lock into place. One side would not lock into place at all! I wanted a play yard that could be easily set up and taken down as needed by me - not one that you would have to call in the troops for assistance. Needless to say, I'm returning it."
5,EXCELLENT READ!! One of my favs for 2003 already!,"ONE HIT WONDER was more than I ever thought it would be. It was a pageturner, a mystery and a book that touched me enough to cry toward the end of the book.Ana and Belinda (Bee) are half sisters. Belinda leaves when Ana is quite young and follows a pop star career. She has one hit, thus the title and her life becomes quite a mystery which Ana unfolds.Ana goes to London to clear up Bee's apartment as Bee was found dead due to an overdose. Ana stays on and meets some of Bee's few friends and thus unravels the mystery of her sister's life.Enthralling read - more intense than I could have imagined. I my read Jewell read and not my last."
3,Over the Top,"I was again disappointed by Lisa Jewell with One Hit Wonder. This story was a bit out there and ends so unbelievably happy and perfect, it's sickening.The story is about a beautiful and troubled pop star named Bee, who dies young. Her agoraphobic, mentally abusive mother, and her sister she hasn't seen in over a decade. Ana, Bee's sister, goes to London to clean out the apartment of her estranged older sister. She comes in contact with her friends and tries to explain the mystery of her life and her death. It's all just way too unreal and out there"
2,Spend $20 more and get a tool twice as good.,The only Airy nailer I've used self-destructed after a few months of use. This is a tool designed for very light use in a workshop- and don't ever drop it.The Porter Cable costs only $20 more and gives you a more rugged tool with better support and plenty of spare parts.
4,A great project,It works great under California sun. A wonderful hands on project for father and son. The book also tells you how to power it up with a battery. My 6 years old son enjoys it very much.
5,Love. This. Movie.,"This could be Jane Austen's best story yet. Well acted and funny, this one is a refreshing change from the woe is me main character of other Austen stories."
2,A pale version of the original,"So you're a Jane Austen fan? This movie is probably irresistable for at least one viewing purely for curiosity's sake. Be warned though, that this movie is so full of celebs that are so busy playing dress-up that it absolutely ruins a classic romance and cleverly witty masterpiece. If it's Hollywood's interpretation of England you want, this movie is for you. Otherwise, stick with the Kate Beckinsale version of Emma."
3,OK If You Define Your Terms...,"If you think Gwyneth Paltrow can do no wrong.If you think Jane Austen was just as comic as Kevin Smith.If you think DVDs are really bad if they load up a lot of unwanted special features.If you think this type of teaser does Jane Austen justice (literally, and from the DVD box):This delightfully fun and lighthearted comedy is based on the story that inspiured the hit movie ""Clueless!"" Dazzling Gwyneth Paltrow (""The Perfect Murder"") shines as Emma - a mischievous young beauty who sets up her single friends. Funny thing is - she's not very good at it! So when Emma tries to find a man for Hariett, she makes a hilariously tangled mess of everyone's lives. You'll enjoy all the comic confusion...until Emma herself falls in love, finally freeing everyone from her outrageously misguided attempts at matchmaking.""[Emphasis and italics omitted; Jane Austen is not mentioned.]"
2,Interesting for comparison...and that's it,"I happened to get to see this one on TV before I could buy it and I must say...its one version I'd rather not own. While the cast is surprisingly familiar from the casts of many other lower-key films I enjoy (and extras from more popular ones) the acting is unusual and disjointed. Personalities from the novel are over-exaggerated or not present at all. My largest dissapointment was with not deemming it worth owning, since it has been my goal to own every TV/theatrical version of all of my favorite Jane Austin-era novels, but this one I don't want, unless its for ""bad movie night"".I do commend Gweneth Paltrow's efforts at playing a role for a story she's probably never heard of and an era never she's bothered to act for. I appreciate her efforts, but the older versions have outdone them.**I know I did not comment on the story line, but I'm certain another reviewer has written enough on the matter...along with Jane Austin."
2,Jane Austen's lesser greats,"A good/fair, viewable Austen story which doesn't quite fullfill its promise. It comes measurably short of ""Pride & Prejudice"", ""Becoming Jane"", ""Persuasion"",""Mansfield Park"", and other Jane Austen's stories, I do believe this Austen presentation, ""Won't be your cup of Tea ?"""
5,Review from a Brit,"I absolutely LOVE this film. It is very faithfull to Jane Austen's book and Gwyneth Paltrow's accent is superb, you really can't tell! I believe that all of the actors did a sensational job of portraying their characters and really sold the story. I have watched this film many times over and it never gets old. I think that making these classic films helps to draw in younger viewers and get them interested in older and more sophisticated novels."
4,Funny and charming!,"I love this movie, it is not better than the Jane Austen novel, but who cares! Gwyneth Paltrow's acting is precise -- her portrayal of the precocious match-maker Emma is excellent. All of the actors were great. Emma tried to be cupid and failed miserably, and she realized this when she fell in love herself.This is a charming and memorable comedy that melts your heart and fills it with laughter. And I'm glad I saw it."
1,Watch the BBC version instead,"This Hollywoodized version of ""Emma"" completely bastardizes the story and diminishes it in every way. The film is more about Gwyneth than the story itself. Even her hairdo is ""clueless."" Gwyneth simply prances around ""playing"" the part of Emma with a ""Look at me! Aren't I cute!"" attitude. She turns the film into a comedy, completely missing its finer aspects. Low-class and cheap."
3,Damned by Faint Praise,"As part of the contemporary rash of dramatic remakes of Jane Austen, this isn't a bad one. (Damned by faint praise, I know...) On the positive side, Ewan McGregor makes a delightful Mr. Knightley and Gwyneth a picturesque Emma. However, while it catches the essential plot of Emma, it fails to catch the flavor and the nuances of the story and is a trifle disappointing. The A&E production, starring Kate Beckinsale, was a more even, complete, and faithful representation of one of Jane Austen's best works. Those not satisfied by Gwyneth Paltrow's interpretation might be made more so by seeing the A&E version."
1,NOT Blu-ray Quality; DVD Is Higher Quality Than This Sham,"This is one of my favorite movies, so I was very excited to see it had been released on blu-ray. BUYER BEWARE: This is not a remastered, high-definition print of ""Emma."" In fact, the quality is even worse than that of the DVD that I foolishly sold after I'd placed this order. The lip sync is off for the entire first scene, and the print quality is TERRIBLE - lots of artifacts and so shaky at times that at first I thought maybe it had been videotaped by some guy with a camera in a theater.Save your money. Buy the DVD for cheap until someone does a proper blu-ray release of this film."
3,"entertaining, but not really austen","If you like Northam and Paltrow, this is a movie you should watch. It is entertaining, although I find that Paltrow is not British enough for my taste and Northam, although a good actor does not do full justice to the character of mr Knightly (or maybe it was the script). There is too much obvious comedy whereas I always think that the comedy in Austen does not come from 'funny' acting, but is derived from the characters and their dialogues.I'll stick to the other Emma with Kate Beckinsale. This version is much more true to the spirit of Austen in my opinion and Mark Strong is perfectly cast as a very serious mr Knightly and Emma has just enough arrogance about her person to make it believable. Even the smaller roles in this version are very very good."
3,Emma For Non-Classic Fans,"I am a big fan of the A&E/Kate Beckinsale rendition, so I approach this from that perspective. This ""Emma"" appears to be an attempt to upgrade the story to a more contemporary audience. The language is made a little more modern (meaning sloppy), the dance music is almost too fast to give time for graceful movement. A visit to a poor family's cottage is a forced attempt to remind us of life for ""the rest of the folks"". So this rendition is more PC.Yet, this movie does present possible logical explanations for some of the A&E gaps, and it does have some interesting spins on how things could progress. Gwyneth Paltrow does not seem to have the emotive repertoire of Kate Beckinsale, which is a diminishment. For those of a more classical bent, this rendition might not satisfy. However, if one reminds oneself that this is NOT the A&E version, it is fairly amusing."
3,EMMA,It looked as though you had copied from tv with ads in it. Not what I expected. That is the first DVD from you that has not been up to your standard of quality.
5,Excellent Movie - Best Adaptation,"I own a few versions of Emma (I admit to being fairly Austen obsessed) but this one is by far the best. Gwyneth Paltrow captures the essential charm of the beautiful, wealthy and unknowingly naive Emma Woodhouse and though the film does not labor to depict every scene and detail of the Austen novel, its scope is comprehensive and one finishes this well spun tale feeling completely satisfied. The casting is perfectly inspired and I found every nuance and inflection of Jeremy Northam's Mr. Knightly true to a man falling dangerously in love. Thoroughly worth the price of admission is the scene between Harriet (Toni Collette) and Emma where Harriet's declaration reveals her as a rival. Toni Collette's innocent (or not so innocent) words fall like daggers and Gwyneth Paltrow masterfully delivers the complexities of Emma's emotional response showing a young woman who finally knows her own heart. If you love Austen, this is the Emma to own."
3,dvd,This dvd was ok but probably not for young ones as the story line would have been harder for them to follow.It was fun to watch.
5,Beautiful ois the only word,"I love this movie! Gwenyth Paltrow's costumes and hair our a feast for the eyes. The dialouge is fun. If you are having a sleep over I suggest the ""Emma"" and ""Clueless"" set. it is fun to compare the differences and similarities."
4,Really like Paltrow's version,"There are alot of ways to play Emma. Paltrow's version is *very* sympathetic and adorable, which can jibe with those who don't like the Emma character very much. She makes alot of faces and her English is full of ohhs and emms, which helps to soften the ramifications and motivations for her meddling. Given the light, playful tone of the film, it works perfectly.I like this adaptation. Winning and very enjoyable."
4,fast delivery and good price,I have not yet had opportunity to use string but I can say delivery was fast and cost was economical. I should be set for several summers !
5,Very good.,"This weed eater' trimmer line is very common product, good enough to use. the price also is good for 200-foot/per bulk."
5,Great product,Ran low on prior line. Good replacement. Good price. It is cheaper than going to the usual hardware stores. Recommend purchasing on line rather that driving and buying!
5,Good product.,This line was very easy to use. I've always used a different brand but found this one to be a lot better.
2,Easily breaks,"I had purchased a new Toro string trimmer a month or so before.It came with a coil of nylon(?) string loaded, so I used it each week normally without any problem.As the string shortened, I bumped out some new line.At one point I purchased this product for eventual use.The time came and I spooled on some of this string.Nightmare.It lasts a short time then breaks off at the feed hole.What a pain to disassemble the head two or three times while I'm working.Clearly cheaply made stuff.Avoid it."
5,Convenient good-quality bargain,"Cheaper than generic per-spool trimmer line, and much tougher. Buying it from Amazon with the Free Shipping also saves me about a gallon of gas (round trip) to the store, which knocks what, nearly three bucks off the already bargain price. Sure it's a little bit of a hassle winding the weed whacker spool myself, but for this price it's well worth it. It doesn't take that long once you get the hang of it. Just follow the arrow on the spool and make sure the line is going around it in the right direction when you wind. I get about 8 or 10 spools per roll of this stuff."
4,Easy and Straight Foward to Read,"Bill presents a lot of good information about journalism, 9-11-01, politicians, personal attacks against him (by members of the elite media, Hollywood, and politicians), and his own struggle to get where he is today. Bill also talks in detail about issues facing America in a critical way backed up by personal accounts and media domination. It is easy reading and straight to the point. Recommended to anyone who enjoys watching his television news talk show on cable, ""The Factor."""
5,"very, very good book",I enjoyed reading this book alot and Mr. O'Reilly really explains who's really looking out for you.
5,Great for college students,"valuable advice in a sincere, entertaining and straight forward manner..."
1,Fluff Piece,"I read this book in it's entirety in less than an hour while standing in a local book store. It's pure fluff, plain and simple, no thoughtful insights that I could take home. My main comment is that if you have to go to Bill O'Reilly to figure out how to lead your life, you're in big trouble. You're better off listening to Dr. Laura.I did hear Bill boast on his radio show last week that this book will ""outsell Al Franken's 5 to 1"". Ummm...Bill, the jury is still out on that one but as of this writing, Al is back at #2 and you are sinking fast. Aren't your 15 minutes of fame over already?"
1,A New Low,"This book is set up like an ""advice"" book (""Be brutally honest with yourself"") but it is basically a frame for O'Reilly's ""insights"". The ""insights"" are his usual simplistic right-leaning views on society's ills, and these are tedious, but the really amazing thing is O'Reilly's apparent delusions concerning his importance as a observer of America. He actually believes that someone other than the dim bulbs who watch his show (mostly, I guess,to confirm their Limbaugh-like delusions and rationalize their pathetic minor league greed) care what he thinks. Ah, if the world were as simple as O'Reilly says it is and good old ""hard work"" was rewarded and those vulgar rappers sang about love like their Four Tops parents, then good old boys from the mean streets of Levitown would be kings."
1,How is dividing the USA into 2 factions helping America?,"I'm a Republican, but I don't subscribe to Mr. Orielly's position of intollerance and hate. Bill Oreilly is not looking out for the Republican party. He's looking out for #1, himself. He represents an extremist position of hate and intollerance to opposing viewpoints. This is not what the Republican party is about.This isn't about REPUBLICAN vs DEMOCRATconservative vs liberalLeft vs RightHow does dividing the United States into 2 factions benefit our country?If divinging the USA into 2 factions isn't benefitting us, then who does it benefit? (hint: his initials are BO)"
4,Great Book,"Really enjoyed this book. Nice to read about someone who worked hard to become such a success. It seems like there are some Franken and Moore fans who visited this site not to write an intelligent review about the book but smear O'Reilly personally. Not much of a shock though. Birds of a feather. Anyhow, I enjoyed the first book a bit but still a well supported, informative book."
3,"Not as bad as they say, but it's not worth your time","I rarely read books by 'talking heads' and this book reminded me why. Let's face it, these guys (on the left and right) are just full of it. They grab onto one little story that highlights whatever they want you to believe and try and leverage it into proving some massive social-political point. From now one I am boycotting everyone from Bill O'Reilly to Michael Moore. If I want to hear an idiot rant I know plenty of people who will drone on for free where I work."
1,Despicable man brags about his boorish behavior,"Let me begin by confessing that I didn't read the entire book. I could barely stand the small segments that I did read, however. Mr. O'Reilly appears to think that it is an achievement to be, in his own words ""a jerk"" ""annoying,"" ""brash,"" and ""rude."" He also apparently thinks it appropriate to brag about his crude behavior. An example is his career as an Altar boy/extortionist. Mr. O'Reilly gleefuly describes how he shook down pallbearers at funerals, threatening to shake the incense too hard and choke the congregation, unless given protection money. He did much the same at weddings, threatening to drop the rings unless the best man or groom bribed him."
1,NOT BILL!,"Nothing new just the same old junk. If you really want to read this book wait until you find it in the bargain bin,under 5 bucks!"
2,The Morton Downey Jr. Of The New Century.,"This book is just like his show; he says a few common sense things and gives some very liberal points of view as well as some conservative ones but then turns around and criticizes liberal groups and politicians while going easy on conservatives (oh, except for Jeb Bush his token republican whipping boy).He starts and ends the book with some feel-good common sense ideas and annecdotes. I wish I could criticize this book, but there was really no depth to it. The only thing that I found really offensive was the polemical attacks against the Clintons. Other than that there was just trivial stuff along with some endorsement of religion in public life. There are no citations whatsoever in his book. I don't trust the truthfulness of his facts or his interpretations. Basically I wasted two hours just to say that I read it."
4,Agreeable,"Now, keep in mind that O'Reilly isn't at the tip-top of my ""Favorite Conservatives"" list (like Hannity, Coulter and Beck are...) BUT, I happen to agree with the man on a lot of what he says in this book.I could ramble on and quote some of the things he says, but he really does make you think: ""Who is looking out for me?"" I mean, it really makes you think."
1,"Don't do me any favors, O'Reilly","I can't tell you how frustrated I am with being a conservative republican with guys like O'Reilly running around. He makes it harder for me to present and debate my conservative belief by taking away any sort of credibility my political ideology might have who those who disagree with me. I guess I could just shout ""Shut up!"" at them. Who's looking out for me, Bill O'Reilly? It's not you. Stop ""helping"" me."
1,Before you read this book...,"Don't waste your money and time on this book. You can do a better job by donating $15 to a charity, planting a tree, or feeding a hungry person. Still if you buy this book, read the chapter on Bill O'lielley in Al Frankens ""Lies and the Lying Liars ..."", FAIR articles on him at http://www.fair.org/media-outlets/o'reilly.html, Slate article at http://slate.msn.com/id/2087706/, or http://www.oreilly-sucks.com/. I am sure you'll get a fair and balanced view of this arrogant bully once you go through resources on both sides."
3,Pretty funny...,"I haven't read the book yet, so this is not a review. I just noticed something funny while looking at Amazon's bestseller list, though. O'Reilly's book, which was just released a couple of days ago, is actually selling fewer copies than Al Franken's competing ""Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them,"" which has been out for over a month. The icing on the cake being that the reason Franken's book has been selling so well is because of the huge publicity surrounding O'Reilly's instigated and subsequently dismissed lawsuit (via the Fox News Channel) against Franken for copyright infringement.I mean, just thinking about Bill laying awake at night, getting steamed and even more splotchy over losing the sales battle to Franken caused solely by his own pushiness and arrogance, makes me giggle."
2,Disappointment,I love Bill O'Reilly but this book is a big disappointment. It's mostly just recycled stuff from his first two books.
5,best book in a long time,"Except for the other O'rielly books this is the best book in a long time. There is a lot of great information in it that has to do with everyday life. It also proves how stupid liberals are. I'm sure O'Reilly is probably the best writer out there, hard to imagine anyone better. If you watch his show on FOX like you should its easy to see why. Buy this book for everybody in your neiborhood and have them read it before the elections. Bush will win in a landslide if you do this. Liberals are stupid idiots and we can't let them run the country. O'Reilly is a true patriot for America and freedom. Some poeple are trying to make up a sex scandal about him to try to bring him down but it won't work. Everything that lady is saying about him is a lie because Bill is a Christian and therefore these things are totally false. She will probably burn to hell. Buy this book to help Bill fight this stupid accusation."
1,The Ruler Test,"Hello there. I am here to review Bill O'Reilly's new book. Ahem. Now, usually when I critique a book, I like to employ what I like to call The Ruler Test, which I have patented and you cannot have. What you do, see, is you try to fit a standard ruler between the covers. If you can't cram it between, then the book is not worth your time. Bill O'Reilly's book is definitely not worth my time, and I don't even have a ruler. Bye.P.S. If I were you, I'd skip right past this lame putz's screed and head right for Timothy Crouse's ""The Boys On The Bus,"" where you'll meet real journalists and lament that toothless, halfwit fictionmongers like O'Reilly now represent this once-unassailable breed."
5,Him on your side,"This thoughts and opinions in this book is as good as it gets for any average American or for that matter any common citizen in any part of this world. As one of the reviewers pointed out - this is not for the closed mind. No it isn't. You may disagree on some the things he says but there'll be a lot where he's speaking YOUR mind out. One of the few honest, brave crusaders left in this messy world.Read it without bias or preconcieved notions about him, forget about being a Republican or a Democrat, just read it plain and simple and you'll end up reading all night, opening yourself to a better, matured new day from then on..."
3,O'Reilly thinks he's looking out for all of us,"No matter what your political bent is, you must agree, Bill O'Reilly is full of opinions. Just ask him, and he'll have a strong opinion on just about any subject.Much of the advice in this book, such as surrounding yourself with people of strong character and invest in relationships, is solid. But this isn't a self-help book. It pretends to be one for a while, but it digresses into a ""what is wrong with the world"" book. I am a conservative, and I agree with many of Bill O'Reilly's opinions, but he comes across as overly arrogant in his ""I know what's best for you"" attitude. He's not the kind of person I would be comfortable getting to know in a real life friendship."
1,FrankenFools Are Out In Force !,"Every FrankenFool hate monger is writing a negative review on this book, even though I'll bet not one of them has read it. In my honest opinion, this is a pretty poor effort from O'Reilly (or O'Lielly, as the FrankenFools like to call him); no where near up to the level of his previous books. Franken's new book, on the other hand is up to HIS usual vituperative, lying, sick, level of venom from the left. I gave his book the same a one star, which is more than it deserved for all the lies about lying in his lying, lie-filled ""book""- and that's no lie."
2,Second String Right Wing,"When O'Reilly first came on the air I respected him because he seemed to be independent. But as time goes on, it becomes clearer and clearer that he's just another conservative commentator. For my money, Limbaugh and Ann Coulter have much better facts and much better arguments. O'Reilly's newest book is just a bunch of preachy opinions with no justification, no evidence, no references. If he wants to play on the right wing team he's going to have to do much better than this if he wants to play on the first string."
1,Undeveloped Mind,"I've seen O'Reilly on the tube many times, but in print I saw another facet.He has a discussion about the existence of God that is perhaps the most juvenile I have ever seen in print on this topic. Like O'Reilly, I went to Catholic schools. The attempted indoctrination included four years at a Jesuit high school. So I sat through many lectures on the nature of God, the chain of causality, yada, yada, yada. O'Reilly's dribble would deserve no more than a ""C-"" as a 10th grade essay.I began to understand why this dork is a bully. It's all he has to work with. His mind is stuck somewhere in middle adolescence, guided not by intellect but by swirling emotions which he can barely harness."
5,What a wonder!,"If you've ever been told to use a humidifier, you know how many there are to chose from! I have tried about 10 over the past 10 winters! Until this one, all were noisey, got musty or I was unable to replace the filter becasue it had been discontinued! This one is so quiet, stays fresh and works magic on my allergies! The best is that the filters are easy to get and just come in one size! No more trying to remember the model number or anything!Just what the doctor ordered!"
1,There are better humidifiers for the price.,"I bought this because many claimed how quite it was, especially on low setting. Well the fan is quite on the low setting because it barely moves. On the higher settings the entire thing vibrates making a sound you can hear on the floor below, even when it is placed on a carpeted floor. I am very disappointed with this humidifier, so much so that I might just throw it away and get a different one. I plan on never buying Vornado again."
2,Skin is still dry.,"I moved out to LA from NY and there is considerable less amount of humidity in LA.My skin was drying up. So I asked and was recommended this humidifier.Unfortunately it did nothing to alleviate my dry skin. I blasted it on high and still nothing.The filter seems to run out pretty quickly. The product seems very fragile. The material is cheap and the water tank doesn't fit properly into the product, so that moving it even it a little causes water to leak.The plus side was that it was easy to assemble and it was cheap."
4,Great Bordeaux Travel Guide,"There are countless books on Bordeaux and its wines.Similarly, the area is covered by the usual travel guides.However, if you are a wine lover trying to plan an exciting trip to Bordeaux and its wine regions, this is the book for you. With itineraries, food and lodging suggestions and an opinionated take on which properties to visit and which to skip, Monty Waldin is an indispensable guide to Bordeaux.I've also used other titles in the series and the excellent older ""Touring in Wine Country"" series also by Mitchell Beazley to great success."
1,Useless video. DO NOT BUY.,This video was a gift for my girlfriend who was learning how to tattoo. this video sure came fast but had NO usefull information at all. Low quality video.
3,its okay,"it is a really cheap set, the board was flimsy and bent when I received it and the pieces are extremely light and hollow, but it still works as a cheap set. Personally, I just bought it for the pieces to use on a more sturdy board I have; maybe others will have better luck with the board."
1,Major problems with this DVD player,"After reading the reviews for this DVD player, I decided to write a review because I have had the same problems as other reviewers. Certain DVDs play fine in this DVD player, yet others skip or have sound interruptions during the movie - since I bought a new DVD player, I have had no problems with these same DVDs at all!"
3,great........ till i put a cd in,yea i got this dvd player a few months ago and it was great I couldn't believe how good it was but at Christmas I got a home theater system and I started playing cd's through the dvd player of course i got new dvd's at Christmas. well while I was watching one of my new dvd's it pause's for a brief second or two and then continues playing but when I played it in another dvd player it still has that mark it so thanks alot to this dvd player my dvd's are all screwed up now I'm stuck with something that scratches my dvds also this dvd dose not play VCD'S so if I were you I would buy this but DO NOT USE CD'S THROUGH IT!!!!!!!!
1,Poor Tootle!,"I usually love the classic Little Golden Books, but this one is unfortunately a stinker, both because it is wordy and not good at holding a child's attention and also because the overarching theme of the book is quite depressing. All Tootle wants to do is frisk and frolic in the meadow; however, he is forced to ""stay on the rails no matter what."" Although I understand and support learning a good lesson about staying on task, I found this book to have quite an unsettling and negative message about conformity. For a vehicle-loving little boy, I would recommend The Fire Engine Book or The Little Red Caboose over Tootle. Poor Tootle."
5,Tootles,"Tootle, a story that brings back wonderful memories. I read this book over and over to my granddaughter from when she was less then 2 years old until she could read on her own. That granddaughter will be a mother herself of a baby girl in the spring 2008. I'm getting this book for her so she can read it to her baby girl"
5,Tootle,As a child I loved trains. Tootle appealed to me because of the fantasy element -- a train being able to leave the tracks to smell the flowers! The moral of the story is teach children responsibility and the importance of following instructions but that's not what I took away from it when I was a toddler.
5,Touching Spirit Bear Review,I really enjoyed this book because of the adventure and action. This book is about a boy who severely injures one of his classmates. He is sent to Circle Justice to decide what to do with him. Garvey a counselor suggested for him to go to island and get rid of his anger. While he was there he set his shelter on fire and tried escaping. After that there was a bear that kept appearing and disappearing. One day he attacked the Spirit Bear. You will have to read the book for yourself to figure out what happens next.
4,Touching Spirit Bear,The book that I am reviewing is Touching Spirit Bear and it is about a fifteen year old cole gaets beaten by his father.Just as cole's father was beaten by his father. Now cole himself is turning violent. He robbed a tool store and he got away with it for a couple of days. until peter his classmate told on him so cole beat him and peter was hospitaized. So cole's parents send him to angermangment classes that didn't help so he gets sent to an island in alaska. They give cole a little hut and supples to survive for a month. He goes walking around the island and he see's the spirit bear and think's that he can beat up the bearlike he did peter the bear broke his arm and leg. Then a few days later the two guys come back and find him on the beach and immedalty take him to a hospital and after he recovered they sent him back to the island for another month and survived.
3,Fun adventure.,"I read this both in English and other lungage. It's little hard to understand at the beginning, but further you go, you will like it.Good story for the kids bullying."
4,Touching Spirit Bear review by sophia,"Touching spirit bearBy Sophia RetchlessThe reason I think that Touching Spirit Bear is a good book is because it is about a teenager named Cole. He has an anger problem. He is sent to Circle Justice to get it straight. The beginning of the book is good ands gets your attention. But in the middle it really starts getting your attention. He starts realizing that life isn't a game. At first the story takes place in Minnesota, but then he has a fight with a boy named Peter. Then he gets sent to Circle Justice. They send him to an island where he gets to se the legendary Spirit Bear. He has to stay there for a whole year. He gets off the island a year later, but I can't tell you everything. So read the book yourself and find out what happened to Cole and Peter. But I really liked this book and I hope you do too."
1,Inaccurate cultural appropriation,This book is an example of exploitation and careless representation. It exemplifies the kind of irresponsible appropriation that should remain in the past.
3,"Ahh, the powerful facelifting magic of Photoshop","Hey, what was wrong with the old covers? You shouldn't be ashamed by what you are/were, right? Isn't that one of the thousands of unwritten rules of sXe? I'm gonna really miss seeing that kid in the crowd with the LL Bean bandana the next time I pick up this overpriced reissue at Tower Records."
1,Nightmare product!!!,"Problems with both hardware and drivers make this product a disaster. Biggest problem is system crashing when signal strength is low or lost. Therefore, any maintenance on the access point means that every computer on the network crashes to blue screen. Additonally, installation requires downloading additional programs to delete any old drivers. ALSO, you cannot update the drivers for a wireless adapter on a wireless connection!!! The DWL-AG660 cannot be used in an encrypted environment. WPA is a non starter and WEP is unstable. Tech support has been rude and unhelpful, especially when you tell them that you are having problems with this particular adapter. I hate being so brutal on a review, however this product has surpassed poor and moved into insulting.I inherited a D-Link network and have found that although the products are extremely difficult to get set up, they work fine when finally set up. The DWL-AG660 is not up to what I have come to expect from D-Link."
1,DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING?,"Amazon.com advertises this product as such: Source Naturals Melatonin, 5 mg, Tablets, 240 tablets. However,when you click on the item to place an order, the number of tablets are only 120, even though the price is the same. How many people don't catch this error. Is it deceptive advertising or is it just a mistake? Amazon.com is a very large company and it's hard to believe these advertisements are not proof read."
2,Broken after only 2 years,"The clarity of the picture is good, and I was happy with the controls. I cannot recommend the purchase of this TV. After just 2 years of normal use, it went up. No picture at all. It has been out for 6 weeks because Best Buy can't seem to find qualified people to work on this TV. Also, I overheard them talking about the poor construction of the boards. They making it very difficult to repair by glueing the parts to the board so you have to purchase an entire new board.Best Buy also has very poor service and I will never purchase their PSP warranty package again. They are not customer oriented and are only the middle guy for the service people, which has you running in circles."
5,This book is amazing for all it accomplishes!,"Althought the age group listed for this book is 9-12, I first learned of it from a preschooler in my classroom. The girl who shared the book does not have a sister, lives with both parents in an upperclass neighborhood, and would seem to have little in common with Essie or Amber. And yet, this story reached her, she connected immediately with the strengths and longings of both children. She wants to BE these children, for their strength and humanity. What a great way to begin to bridge the socioeconomic gap! Other children from very diverse backgrounds in my class were also immediately drawn to the poetry of warmth, hope, caring, friendship amidst troubling circumstances."
3,"Steel City Galvanized Steel Ribbed Rural Mailbox, Silver #2-2S",A bit disapppointed. Not as well constructed as expected. Not sure how long it will last!
4,Decent,"This book is a decent source for an overview of a number of fish. It does seem to be missing a lot of fish that are somewhat common in fishtanks, such as puffer fish, etc. If you're looking for a general book with lots of pictures then this book can satisfy. However if you're looking for more in depth information or specific fish, this book can be hit and miss."
5,Beautiful book!,I love this book! I got a number of fish books for my fiance for Christmas. He has really gotten into freshwater fish and has six tanks at home now that he takes good care of. Out of all the books I got this was definitely both of our favorite! The pictures are high quality and beautiful. It is well organized and a great book to use as a reference tool or just to put out on your coffee table for leisurely perusal. I highly recommend it.
2,"Rambling, peevish, predictable, questionable","A bizarre mishmash of half-baked non-ideas. Jacobs clearly hates the Romans yet the Dark Ages we commonly refer to refers to the period after their downfall. If they were so bad, shouldn't we be glad that they disappeared? Jacobs relies too much on Diamond and (horror of horrors) Armstrong. In all this, Jacobs demonstrates a surer sign of cultural decline: an irrational disgust with one's own culture and its foundations. I stopped reading seriously after the chapter on education versus credentialing mainly because it only barely touched on the subject. I started skimming after that, then just gave up. As other reviewers note, Dalrymple is a much more interesting and smarter critic---and a far superior stylist."
3,Losing Knowledge,"The central tenet seems to be that if you don't support the people and systems you need, then your city/society degrades. And it is hard to regain lost knowledge.I see this on a regular basis inside large complex industrial and information technology environments where things get 'old' quickly. They lose the knowledgeable staff (due to retirement or layoffs, etc.) with the assumption that they can be replaced by newer technology or cheaper people.Its a nice read, with good examples that will ring true for most city dwellers."
3,"Good for the basics, but...","I can't see dropping almost $20 for this book, for the size I think it should be more like $7 to $10 at the very max. It does tend to get wordy and confusing. I like it for learning the basics of the Sabbats/Esbats and, hey the pictures are pretty! ;)I've had this book for close to 10 years and still pull it out as a refresher, which it is very good for. Alas, I can't suggest a better book w/a more ""biased"" (read: less Celtic) approach, which is why I do recommend it for it's basic content."
5,Very informative.,"I was looking for something to help me understand the reasons behind and the rituals of Pagan Holidays. This book does that and more. It inludes recipes and detailed ""tool"" list. Love it! I would highly recommend it."
4,Probably the best of his later works....,"""Deep Dark Truthful Mirror"" is possibly the most painful yet fantastic song I have ever heard...listen closely and it will send you straight into therapy. Elvis' take on the ""big guy"" in ""God's Comic"" made me love EC even more than before because I have always suspected that God is more like EC's idea of him than anything the Christians have come up with. ""This Town"" drew me in, and has remained one of my ""best of"" Elvis songs since I first heard it. Some rough spots (Pads Paws & Claws, Chewing Gum), but all in all a good CD."
2,"nice looking, doesn't work so good","I've had this for several years. I love the way it looks, but unless there is a large amount of rain (e.g., an inch or more), the float is not displaced by the water and it gives a low or now reading. it appears that there is too much friction between the plastic tube and the brass interior. I have tried washing with soap and water, but that has only improved marginally.I still use it in my front yard, but I bought a simpler working one (glass tube with calibrated markings) that works much better"
4,Hyundai DVD Player,I was searching for an inexpensive DVD player. I read the customer reviews on the Apex and other models and they were pretty mixed. I figured for [$$] it's tough to go too far wrong. I took a chance by buying before reading a custoer review.The installation was a snap. The remote is easy to use (this was a problem with some of the Apex reviews I read). The Dvd's I've played so far work fine.An excellent buy for someone unsophisticated like me.
2,ARGH--subtitle problem!,"I logged on with the intention of writing this review because we are very disappointed with the subtitling problem (other than that, it is a good, low-cost DVD). I am glad I did in order to find out that we're not the only ones with this problem and find some ideas to deal with it! We are going to try to ""work around"" the problem using some of the tips here, and if that doesn't work, we're going to try and send it back to Hyundai (if we can figure out how to do it with the lack of documentation in the manual)!"
3,low budget dvd,"* audio is very decent* Video quality is bad (grainy, colors too saturated)* video signal turns off in completely black scenes* decent price* remote is not userfriendlycan read other region codes !!!"
1,Not Very Good!,I bought it because the reviews were pretty good. I received mine and the subtitles do not go away after I shut them off repeatedly. It also takes about 10 times before it actually loads a DVD. You get what you pay for here!
2,"sparkle, but no depth...","The only reason to buy the book is the list of suppliers in the back. The only list I've found so far for paints which are safe for use on skin.I found this book disapointing.The photos are beautiful, but too much space is used on 'lick-and-stick' tatoos. One was more than enough.If you can't figure out how to apply them from the instuctions on the card, you have a problem...More images of body paint or henna would have been appropriate.The book also promised tips on makeup and hair, I found the styles mundane and the instructions mediocre ."
1,"You'd get a zero, but they won't let me go that low.","Man are we reading Sherlock Holmes or Doctor Who? A race of intelligent humaniod rats? Strickly sci-fi, not for a serious Holmes student. I suggest the short story in ""Resurrected Holmes"". Yeah, it's wild too, but in its context, The Raven says it's twice as believeable! Quoth the Raven..."
1,Waste of Time,A laughable attempt to take advantage of the Holmesian's desire for new adventures. Giant Rat indeed...must be a reference to the author. Please..Please...Please..don't waste your money. Fortunately I borrowed a copy from the Library. After two chapters I started skimming and finally threw the book aside in disgust.
5,Dust is Gone,"In the past we have had a dust problem. We needed to dust every 4 days to make it livable. We received our Vorado Air Cleaner. We were wondering if it realy worked. We gave it a trial. It has been 4 weeks and still no noticeable dust. The air circulation is great. It is a little noisy,however to get around that, we operate is at maximum setting at night. We like it so much we purchased another one for our other home. Great product."
4,Great Product,"We are all breathing easier around here with the Vornado air cleaner! It is loud, but I don't think that can be avoided with any air cleaner. We now live with constant white noise. The only problem I have encountered with the Vornado; is the elastic bands which hold the pre-filter in place. They both snapped, all by themselves I might add within weeks of purchase. I called the company for replacement--2 weeks ago--they've not yet arrived. If you purchase one, I would call and ask for replacement bands right away, before they snap. apparently it is a very common problem with this product."
5,every pet owner should have one!,"i purchased this unit about 2 months ago and have been very pleased with it. it is noisy, but i run it on high while i'm at work and leave it off when i'm home and it still does a great job.i've noticed a marked changed in the smell and dust in my home since using this.word to the wise though - if you have several pets (i have 4 dogs), you're going to go through the pre-filters quickly. they recommend changing them every 3 months, but mine are loaded after 1 month."
5,Great read!,I love the illustrations and simple text in this book.I got it as a board book for my baby. He's almost 3 and we still read it all the time.
5,An Absolute Must Have!,"This book belongs in every childten's library. I have 4 children ranging in ages from 20 down to 2 years (only 1 is a boy). It is a book I should of bought years ago. I just kept taking it out of the library. This time, I will buy it!This is a perfect example of ""a little goes a long way!"" It's simple text and clear & colorful illustrations have made this book a favorite of all my children."
3,Colors and motion,"A simple picture book of colors. The red caboose, orange tank car, and all the other cars travel through tunnels and over trestles, in the night and in the day. A Caldecott Honor Book in bold blocks of primary colors. A nice book for daycares and preschools."
3,A Good Picture-to-Story Transition Board Book,"This is a simple presentation of the different cars on a freight train, with rhythmic text describing each car. It's a better board book than picture book, because for toddlers the bright colors and simple lines are very pleasing, but it might not hold the interest of older readers. This is good for the transition from looking at pictures to understanding stories, especially if the young reader can have exposure to a real train."
1,Spare Parts?,"Where could I order the following spare parts:a) A Power Cord.b) Adapter Plate.Regards,Yuval Sharony"
5,Very comfortable sandals,After wearing the sandals for a few hours each day for around three weeks they have broken in very nicely. The cork footbed gives nice support and the soft footbed feels great. I like how they sandals have a nice arch support and basically mold to your feet. The nubuck leather straps have also broken in and feel very nice.
5,Great sandal every time,"Bought for my husband who walks miles every day. He won't even try another kind of sandal. He has long, wide feet and finds these shoes are extremely comfortable. They look good. Can be resoled. What more can you ask?"
5,Luv 'Em,"When my old Birkenstocks wore out I didn't have the money to buy a new pair, so I went cheap. What a mistake! I will never do that again. Can't live without my Birkenstocks. I love the support they have in the arch of the foot."
1,Where is the continuity?,"How much of an excuse do you need to write a novel which includes all manner or blood and gore? Dead bodies, mental & physical torture, child rape, blood letting, heart removal, family abattoir. Perhaps a fast read, but so what? Rather than a novel, it strings us along as if but a collection of rambling, disjointed horrors. We diligently follow the scattered trail of mayhem looking for a bit of understanding, but ultimately find none, ending with barely a single character left alive to sort out the forsaken mess.The Devil-Ex-Machina climax pops out of nowhere, wipes out everyone left standing, while simultaneously and abruptly changing the writer's narrative point of view to that of a new character we haven't even met prior; only heard about. All this while the main character passes out just one more time.Oh, yes. Let's wrap this one up in blood smeared butcher's paper with a fancy bow of liberated entrails and call it a gift."
1,Too gross for me,"I read ""Run"" by Blake Crouch first and really enjoyed it so I bought Desert Places. I like a good thriller but this was way too gross for me. When the main character had to chop up a women with a knife or be killed himself I had to stop reading the book."
2,bummer,"first i read ""Pines"" and thought it was crazy awesome. then i read ""Run"" and thought it was pretty good, but not as good as ""pines"".Then i read this one. its not that its bad, i just thought it was kind of boring and never really seemed to go anywhere special, just plodded along.the characters are well developed and the writing itself is good, just the story comes up lackluster; especially compared to the other two books by this author that i read."
2,Desert places,"I found the book started off promising but turned out to be gruesome and not the suspenful book I thought it would be...it dragged out and never really climaxed, I was disappointed. I was waiting for something that never happened."
3,Fair,"This is a fair debut thriller.I like the premise of one twin tormenting and basically manipulating his brother via horrific murders. I also enjoy the main character who is written with intelligence.However, this thriller is EXTREMELY descriptive when it comes to the violence and kind of turned me off a little bit. I am not sure there was such a need for detail after detail about the actual murders.Still, not a bad read for a first time author."
1,Amateurish,"Complete and total trash, the story never gets to the level where the reader can suspend belief and just enjoy it. It's illogical and poorly plotted. Most comic books have better developed characters. Appears to have been written by a high school sophomore who has read too much Stephen King. Sorry."
1,novel of terror,"this books grabs you in immediately.""don.t even think of calling the police. i am always watching you.""i could not put it down. crouch and kilborn can really tell a scary story."
4,eBay beginners,"Great book for those who are serious about starting to sell on ebay with the hopes of attaining a successful income and business. This book brought up alot of good points and stresses the importance of starting it up as an official business, from the get go. I have not finished reading it yet, but it is a great resource for things to expect, easier ways of doing things, and also some of the problems and how to deal with them (or avoid them!).For those who are already business savvy, this might be too ""beginner level"" for them. For me, it is perfect."
2,"Borrowed idea from the movie ""Of King and Country""","When I read this book and came upon the scene where Rutledge was remembering his killing Hamish, the ghost who plagues his conscience, I was struck by how much this seemed like the climactic scene of the old British film ""Of King and Country"" starring Dirk Bogarde. If you watch that movie, you'll see many comparisons in this book. Ideas are not sacred but it seemed a bit blatant to me."
2,Interesting Concept But Much Too Slow-Moving,"Unlike the book itself, I will make a long story short and advise you that while the plot is interesting, the long drawn out solution is not worth the effort."
5,Excellence at Davisville,"Just a simple 4 stars for Mr Schroder and Ms Emma for their book about the Seabees at Davisville, Rhode Island. Excellent photographic history of this unique military organization. The Navy Seabees continue to be an important part of our military."
4,Great book,This is a great story. Does anybody know the email address of the author John Blumenthal? I want to get in touch with him. Thanks for a great book.

3,RCA VCR #VR637HF,"There is one important thing to note about this VCR if you do any sort of component-mixing or dubbing. The front panel display does not show the input mode or the tape speed--the only way you can tell is looking at the TV screen. So, if you're not using this VCR as the primary component hooked up to your TV, you'll have to keep two inputs/outputs going at the same time or have to continuously switch back and forth to know if you're in the right input (on the right channel) for recording or playing, or to find out if the VCR is in SP or SLP mode.The picture is also not as clear as my old Sharp VCR, especially in brown and red hues, although it's good enough for general viewing."
5,thanks,Speaks for itself as it fits our chainsaw. Came on time/or early and was nice to find in the off season for our local stores.
2,Quality does not compare to original chain,Does not seem to be made of the same quality as the chain that came with the Poulan I purchased. Need to sharpen it quite often after just cutting a few logs. Once sharpened it works OK again but all the wear and tear plus al the sharpening will result in a short life for this product. I made sure the tension was not too tight. Next time I will do a little more research a far as where the item was manufactured.
5,Chain saw chain,This chain was ordered for a Poulan electric chainsaw. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition. I am pleased with this product.
1,Beware -- this is not 2 chains,"I purchased this item thinking that it was a reasonable price for 2 chains. However I only received 1 chain -- when I asked the vendor (Builder Depot) about this they said the ad was in error, told me to keep the 1 chain I received, and gave me a full refund. So, beware, the ad is in error, but the Vendor is very honest and a pleasure to deal with."
2,Didm't last long,After replacing this original hoover belt (which fit very tight) it only lasted one month and burned up again.
5,A beautiful little piece,It's a very elegant piece of jewelry with a rich genuine honey amber; outstanding value for its price. Looks very nice and unusual. Beware that it comes without a chain though.
5,Another Hilarious Tyler Perry Play,all i can say is Tyler Perry picked the right actors and actressesfor this play! It was great and enjoyable and the musical endinghad me and my family up dancing and singing LOL great play!!!
2,Of little use to me at this time,"I have the F5000 table and purchased these hoping they would be more comfortable when fully inverted than the standard rig that comes with the table. I was wrong. These have the same painful pressure points and some new ones. Very awkward to put on straight and once you invert they start to poke, pinch and bite immediately. I can invert at least 5 minutes with the standard rig but can't tolerate more than 30 seconds with these boots. I am going to keep trying them. Perhaps they will break-in or perhaps I need to experiment with different snugness settings or using some talcum powder at the pressure points. If I find they become more comfortable I will update this review. For now, 2 stars only because they are a safe, secure way of hanging. Not more comfortable, though."
5,Early Instrument Combination,"This is an interesting combination of two early instruments, the lute and the viola da gamba. As such, this CD represents a sound you're not likely to hear elsewhere. The compositions dating from the late 16th through the 18th centuries are well played. The program presents an excursion slightly off the beaten path that is well worth the trip."
3,Tejendra is great,would love to hear Tejendra Majumdar paired with Shahid PervezI personally think that would be a more comparable jugalbandi.Tejendra can open up and play to his potental (I've heard his solo charukeshi)
3,Good and simple,This is a very nice book. My son is hearing impaired and so we are using this to learn sign. It's very simple though so you get through it fast when reading it before bed. It's a great book though.
2,Let's Sign,Great Book. It was suppost be in excellent condition. Ends were all chewed up! Not a good buy. I would not have purchased it even at garage sale.
1,BABY SIGN,"THIS BOOK WAS VERY HARD FOR ME TO FIGURE THE SIGNS, BECAUSE THE CHARATERS HAND MOVEMENTS WHERE TO SMALL. THE HANDS ARE AS SMALL AS ON THE FRONT OF THE BOOK."
3,weight workout,"I bought this one because of the other reviews. Yet it is so bland, I have trouble staying with it. The leader seems wooden and bored, although the workout is good. I haven't been able to keep with it. Not a good dvd for me, but do enjoy other weight training with weights dvds. Think twice before ordering this one."
1,Fitness Specialist,"As a fitness professional, I can honestly say that this dvd is not very motivating and even less inspiring. No music plus minimal progressions would put this very low on my recommendations for kettlebell workouts. Gin Miller is really on target on her workout using kettlebells and would be my #1 choice to learn proper use and form."
1,Worst work-out video on the market,"I returned this dvd. This is a sleeper! No music, not motivating, this dvd is for couch potatoes! No way can you get a workout with this DVD"
5,A great story with an excellent Charles Sheen,"The story could have been written by Stephen King: Psychologically down because of the emotional stress of his job ex-investigator and bestseller author James MacGregor (Charles Sheen) moves from America to the Scottish Highlands. But instead getting some peace to sort out his life he becomes the target of an serial killer who sends him faxes to announce upcoming murders. A dead girl found in his garden makes him the local police's No.1 suspect. This means back to work for MacGregor to find the true killer. Charles Sheen's performance is absolutely brilliant, another proof of his wide spread talents as an actor. Seems he easily plays every role, no matter if it's comedy or serious material."
3,"Thunderous Double-Bass Drum, but constipated screaming....","The first album from an Orange County straight-edge metal band brings hard hitting syncopated China crashes and relentlous showers of lead weighted guitar riffs. The singing might get a bit tiresome after a while and is not recommended for your grandmother. Although not as interesting as Slayer, and not as crazy as Death or Biohazard, if you're in the mood for some solid straight-edge, Adamantium is the way to go for some good clean fun."
2,A Writer's Eclectic Notes,"This isn't really a book. It's more like a collection of writer's notes thrown together with a title slapped on the front of it. E.g., 792. Madison on sects -- not a word about the Holy Spirit, but a closing comment about how religious liberty facilitates renewal movements. 83. Dress-down Sundays. Nothing about the Holy Spirit. Many posts mention Pentecostal churches, or pentecostalism, but nothing specific about the Holy Spirit per se. If you like a flea market, enjoy rummaging around to see what you can find, you may enjoy this book. But, if you are looking for something cohesive, this is not the book for you."
1,Doesn't work,It doesn't do what it's supposed to do.This gizmo is supposed to clean out the pores and generally clean up the skin on your face. Didn't work for me.
1,Poor belt performance,New Product purchased from [local store]. Only used a few times when belt broke. Brush shaft had marks from poor placement of the roller. Very heavy cleaner. I plan to change brands and give this one away. Loss of [money].
4,Expect the unexpected or whatnot,Really nice weirdness from Tim K of Joan Of Arc. Not as sparsely produced as the other e.p. with ball-point pen cover art. This one has guests!The cover itself is hilarious!
3,Lousy receiver for radio,"I bought this unit after reading many reviews on this website and on others. The price was right for what I wanted - an ipod ready stereo to replace my stock radio/5 cd changer in my honda. Circuit City installed the unit, and for about a week I used the stereo. My main complaint was most of the radio stations had problems with static most of the time. Stations I could get 40 miles away from town were now full of static as I drove around town. I went back to CC and they made sure everything was hooked up right, but I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the Sony. I replaced the Sony with a Pioneer DEH-P3900MP (which they told me had a better reciever) for about the same price. The guys there were great, but the Sony was a disappointment. I have had the Pioneer for a few days now, and am much more satisfied."
3,Guilty or not ?,"The book ""Monter"" is written by Walter Dean Myers is about a boy called Steve Harmon who is on trail for murder. He and his friend James King s accused for robbing a drugstore and killing the owner. It's not clear if Steve did somthing in the robbery or not. The book is written as a movie script with Steve's diary entries."
4,"Quick read, excellent story","Quick read, excellent story. Steve Harmon is a 16-year-old on trial for the murder of a drug store owner during a robbery attempt. He is accused of being a look-out for the robbery. The reader knows essentially what the jurors know - except for brief, descriptive scenes of Steve's incarceration. Steve comes from a loving stable home. He's an aspiring film student and a loving older brother. The impact of how quickly and how terribly things can go wrong is very strong. An excellent story for teens - neither condescending or boring - but one adults can appreciate as well."
1,A COMING OF AGE STORY,"This book taght me the habit of mind called perseverence. the main character steve is wrongfuly charged with aiding aliquer store hold up turn muder, heis sent to prison while waiting 4 his trial.while inside he narrotes the story as a sreen play. this makes the book a interesting read.his perseverence will inspire you to not take your freedom ad life for granted"
3,Watching Your Life Passing Before Your Very Eyes,"Steve is a black teenager from Harlem. ... He doesn't have a perfect life, not by far, and he doesn't make the best choices. This book is written as a screenplay. It took several pages for me to get into it, but don't give up. In a short time, you will be completely drawn in. Steve is lookng at potentially spending his life in jail. Read this thrilling book to find out what happens to Steve's life."
2,Only because I'm black,The book ''Monster'' is written by Walter Dean Myers.The main charackter of this book is Steve Harmon. He is a black guy who is accused for a robbery and murder. Steve Harmen is involved in a robery.Now he is on trial and he tries with his lawyer Mrs. O'Brien to convince the jury that he is innocent. The outher wants us to decide as jury if he is guilty or not guilty. His target audience are the teenager.He wants to show how hard it is to convince the jury.I don't like this book because the language is to hard to understand the story. But I think the book is very dramatic.I would recommend to read the book if you likr drama.
3,Good book,"Read this book for my English class, turned out to be a pretty decent book. I hope to find more books that appeal to me like this one."
4,MONSTER,"Monster is a story giving you a glimps of jail,a court hearing and a young mans life being held on trial for felony murder. Writen in a movie format coming as close to real life as possible this book tells you how bad being locked in a cell with hate,anger,rage,and lonelyness can actualy be or sound. I would recomend this book to others especialy people who like to read about real life activites. I would give this book 4 stars."
5,monster,The book monster was very good. I think that it is a book that every one specially young people should read. I liked the way this book talked about exactly what's happening today with some young people. This book taught me a lesson too. It tought me how you don't really know if the friends you have are trully your friends. The book even made me feel kind of bad or sorry for steve and how the guys he hanged around like king and the other couple of guys involved in the murder and in the robbery accused steve just to save themselves. I think I would recomend this book to other people.
4,"Great, but not exactly the best","I liked this book, and reading it's worth anybody's time, but the quality of writing just doesn't match up to books like THE OUTSIDERS by S.E.Hinton. The main character isn't what you'd call very likable, and some of the context gets boring once in a while. Still, it shows real inner city life and prejudices that still exist today very clearly. The writing feels like Steve(the main character)is talking to you. It's worth the monwy and an excellent book, but just not at the very top."
4,Monster,"The book ""Monster,"" by Walter Dean Mayers,is a very interesting. i felt like i was righty there hearing the trial with my own ears. I think that this is a great bookm for yong adults to read. it sends the message that we shuld be carful where we go and not to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. steve was i the wrong place at the wrong time and now if hengets convicted he will be facing a minuim of 25 years i prison. also this novel teaches young peiople to be carful who you trust. this novel is one of the best that i have ever read. if u want to read an exciting and suspenceful book then you should read monster"
3,Nothing special,"This book is about a 16-year-old boy named Steve Harmon on trial for helping a robbery that ended in a murder. The whole book is based on him writing a movie and telling about jail. Its really quick of a read if you need to read a book fast. Overall its a well written book, but it gets kind of boring. Bu it was amazing how fast i read this book for school. I would only recommend the book if you need to read something fast but besides that there is no point to read it."
4,"Guilty, or Innocent???","I think Monster is a great story. It has a different format that makes it more interesting to read and to really see and feel what's going on. You are able to follow the story line and know what is happening at all times. I liked that Myers, the author, didn't give us the full details until the parts when we took a trip to the past. That was pretty cool. A boy named Steve is on trial for murder, and with the help of his lawyer, they try to clear his name. I can't tell you everything, but it is definitely a must-read!"
4,Interesting Read,"In this read, ""MONSTER"". There is an unfair event. A 16 year old boy gets accused of doing something he did not do, possibly because of his race. Why should a good kid get in trouble for doing absolutly nothing wrong? Well thats what happened in this book. So he wrote things in a journal every night as if he were writing a movie.Steven was called a Monster but his lawyer was 100% on his side the whole time. It was interesting to see how you can get in trouble for something that you did not do and the other person get away with it. I wonder how many others are suffering in jail right now for something they did not do. Will he be able to prove to the judge that it was not him and will he be free to go home. I personally think this was a interesting read. I also think that this is a good read for eveybody. You will feel like you are right there in the scene. Well..good luck and enjoy this book."
2,Monster,"Oh what a disapointment. I had heard great things about this book from my peers and colleagues(who are into youth fiction)so I was expecting great things. I must say that I was less than impressed. I expect a Myers book to be more creative. I found the story line to be predictable with little excitement or desire to continue reading. While the characters had some elaboration, I felt that the story, as a whole, was lifeless. The only reason I finished the book was because it was an assignment for a Graduate class. Otherwise, I would have never finsihed the book, nor found out the verdict, which again, was predictable. I just expected more..."
4,Monster review by: Rosa Elizarraraz,"Monster was a cool book. It had a little bit of everything.It was suspensful, funny, and scary at the same time. This book made me understand how people feel when their in jail surrounded by strangers and being alone without no one to talk to. I also realized how bad people can sometimes be."
5,Top Twenty,"Monster was an outstanding book, an uncanny message about the consquences of guilty by association written in disguise as a playwrite. So much emotion is piled into each page that even as the character is not fully descripted readers are compelled to reach out for this unfortunate teen as he is put through trial after trial for a crime he did not commit. One is taken into the main character-16 year old Steve Harmon- while he undergoes and inhabits a world fit for men. Creatively presented and geniously compounded, this novel is a must for all American teenagers and should be among the greatest ever for Children's Literature."
3,the greatest review ever,"The story was about a young boy that was accused for murder and all through the story he was waiting for his trial. He liked to shoot movies and other things to. He was explaining in the story how horrible jail was. Also he was talking about how tuff he has to act in jail. But really he's sensitive.I wouldn't recommend this book if you like action like me,because this book takes too long to get in the story and when it finally get's in the story it doesn't make any sense. I'm not saying that it's a terrible book but in my record it's my second worse book but everybody else likes the story so I will give it a three."
3,Tyler's book review,"Monster by Walter Dean Myers, is about a kid named Steve who is 16 years old, he is black, and lives in New York. Steve is a boy who goes to jail, because he robbed a store. Almost the whole book is about him in the court room.This book is definitely a book worth reading, because it is written very well. It's worth reading but it's very hard to understand because it is written in a movie form. This book would be great for 12-13 year old, because the way its written is hard to understand but it would be easy enough for 12 and 13 year olds to understand. There for this book was very interesting and a good book."
3,So-so,"I think the book was really well written. The style was very original and interesting, but I don't feel the book was very challenging. The format kept you wondering what the outcome would be and I found myself constantly changing my mind. The charcters were very realiztic and the story had a good consistant pace where I didn't find myself bored or overwhelmed. All in all I'd say it was a good quick read."
4,VELASCO SCOTT 4,"The book "" Monster "" by Walter Dean Myers is about a boy named Steve that was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Steve was in a grocery store when some other people robbed the store and killed the owner. Steve was taken to jail and now fighting for his life. This is a really good book. I would recommend it to anybody."
4,Family matters when it comes to monsters,"I used this book as an assigned class novel for my 8th graders. They were glued to the book from begining to end. The focal point that I had my class focussed on was relationships with people. This book does a wonderful job depicting different types of relationships that people have with each other and how the cliche, ""run with dogs you will get fleas"" can be so true. My male students really got into it. It's better when used in conjunction with the audio, because of the way the text is formatted."
5,MY REVIEW ON MONSTER,I am going to tell you about a book called Monster. It has 281 pages. Its a realistic fiction because it could realy happen.This story takes place in New York City.16-year old Steve Harmon is on trial for murder.Will he be convited read this grate book and find out. I liked Monster because it was wrote like a movie. And you could see in your mind what was going on.Also it was like reading his diary.people only 11-adults should read this book. In conclusion people that want to read a grate book.Pick up Monster at a libaray or local book store.
3,Yawwwwwnnnn,"After such good reviews, I had such high hopes in this book... Sadly, it was a complete let-down. I finished the book one hour after purchasing it, and unlike the reviews I read, I was not impressed. Granted, the style of writing was fun to follow, an easy read... But, lacked substance. The writer seemed to have no first or second hand experience of prison or court sessions. It's like a bad movie, where it is filmed in only one location for budget purposes. Some people stated that is gave a good insight on real prison life, and the struggles of a ""fish"". Maybe one total page was written about his experience behind bars, and the book is filled with inaccuracies and blunders. Read this book if you run out of sleeping pills."
4,Great price!,It was the color I liked and very finctional-with the ease of Timex-great brand-not easy to set but-Ok to use!! Great price!!
2,Great watch; terrible band.,"I purchased this watch less than a year ago from Amazon. It was a fantastic companion to my daily exercise and work routines, until the band split. I discovered, subsequently, that it cannot be mounted on another band by design, and that the resin material is completely resistant to repair by epoxy, hot glue, or super glue. Electrical tape held it together for a while, but after just under 12 months of ownership I was left with a fully functioning and completely unwearable watch."
3,Ironman Ladies Watch,"I like the product but it's kinda hard to set everything, not user friendly. It's time consuming but I figured it out."
3,"Love watch, but NOT A FLIX watch!","watch is great, looks just feminine enough, amazon pricing & shipping awesome as ever. One complaint is that the listing that i purchased the watch from stated that this one had the FLIX feature, so all you had to do is flick your wrist to activate the indiglo feature, but this watch doesnt have that feature, nor is it even listed in the owners manual, so its a mistake on amazon's part. Still keeping the watch, but I wouldn't have bought this one had i not been expecting the flix feature....so im a little disappointed."
4,"great watch, band sucks","This watch is great and helps me stay organized. The only problem is that the band is of poor quality. Mine snapped in half after 6 months. Instead of buying a new watch, I simply bought a new band and replacing tool from eBay for about $12. The watch itself is still going strong one year later."
4,good product,"I really like this watch. But so far I have just used it to tell time with. The instructions that were encluse with it were written in really small type, but I didn't have any trouble setting the time. There is a web site and a phone number that will aid you in setting up the other functions of the watch. I will use them this spring when I need the sports part of the watch"
3,New with Acrobat,"Some text fails to print even though it is displayed on the screen which is very frustrating. And looking up the cause is overwhelming because the help screens give me unrelated printing information.And, some text is able to be edited but other parts don't even type in no matter what you do.Who has time to fool with something that should not be doing what it's doing in the first place? These small things should not be issues at all. There is no reason why text that shows up on the screen does not print out except bad coding, in my opinion."
4,Still the leader in document creation and protection.,"The most immediate feature you will notice about Acrobat 7.0 from previous versions is the load time. Although still not the fastest program, the loading time is cut dramatically from 6.0. It also does a very nice job of converting webpages into PDF files. Great for sharing.Some of the new features in 7.0:Adobe Acrobat 7.0 Standard software is the simple way to create and share more secure and reliable Adobe PDF documents.* Create Adobe PDF documents from Microsoft Outlook* Enjoy improved performance* Use enhanced headers, footers, and watermarks* Enjoy improved attachment capabilities* Organize Adobe PDF documentsThe READER is still a free download if you don't need to create/edit docs."
2,"Software good, Adobe Activation Process very bad","This will be my last Adobe software. Changed to a new laptop and deactivated and activated to my new new laptop. Now every time I start it needs reactivation. I have disabled outgoing internet access in my firewall from programs like Acrobat because Adobe's habit of doing push marketing into their software. But that screws up the reactivation and you cannot use the software. When I tried the phone automated reactivation, it refused the numbers that the program gave me to enter! The customer service will want an e-mail address to send you a patch to ""fix"" the reactivation problem and they asked me for phone number as well!The choice for Adobe is simple, stop doing your push marketing into your software that I pay money to acquire and I will forgive your problems with reactivation. You cannot have your cake and eat it too inconveniencing legitimate users of your software. Adobe has not learnt from Intuit obviously."
1,Adobe Acrobat 7 quits no reason,"After buying Adobe Acrobat Std 7 and installing it (tediously I might add); I proceeded happily for ~1 year. Then it quit working!!.. After opening a .pdf file it qould simply stop and terminate!!, no amount of searching gave me any clue, reinstalling severtal times gave me no differnt result. My advice.. save your money. Use Adobe 5 until they have fixed all their glitches..."
3,Onegin,"Beautifully conceived with lovely period costumes, sets and scenery, but very SLOW-paced. Lots of ""mysterious"" close-ups of Tyler's and Fiennes' beautiful faces, into which we're supposed to read deep thoughts. The movie feels like it tries to make up for a lack of plot through their quiet, lengthy stares."
3,did not work for me,I was using this in combination of omega 3 and not much difference on me. I used it alone for 3 weeks when I ran out of omega3...
1,Useless,"I have found no benefit to this item. I have taken religiously for a few weeks and no inches loss, no added energy, no weight loss! I am maintaining a healthy diet and have begun an exercise routine and this product has done nothing! Very disappointed!"
2,Tonalin CLA,I have taken this product for 8 weeks and have not seen a difference. Maybe you need to take it longer. Very disappointed I didn't lose any weight.
5,Lauraine Snelling is the best !,"I would highly recommend any of the books written by Lauraine Snelling, they are all well written, faith based , historical fiction books. As a Christian I have enjoyed this series as well as other fiction series sets."
5,Favorite book in my house for the little ones !!,"My grandson's favorite, favorite book !!!! He is a special needs child and this book is one that he can really relate to."
5,Out of Print but found!!,"Our grandson adores this book from the library. Our daughter tried to find it to purchase but sadly found that it was out of print. I ordered it through one of the Amazon used/new sellers (from the U.K.!)You should have seen the delight on our grandson's face when he unwrapped it on Christmas! Darling, simple board book, perfect for little train lovers!"
2,There is a reason she is obscure,"If there were a fire at my house and I could save only one CD, this would be it... ONLY IF I had just one CD to begin with. Since I have more, I prioritize this at the bottom just above the AOL CD ROMs that keep coming in the mail. I was attracted to this album after hearing one of Sibbery's tracks on a compilation album called ""Voce, Women of the World"". It was enough to suspect she had talent, so I bought ""Bound by the Beauty"". After four optomistic efforts of trying to like this disk, I just can't. She does have a great voice when she isn't singing in an annoying falsetto (which is about half the time). Her lyrics are so quirkily slapped here and there that they go beyond artistic and become merely self-indulgent. Maybe she has better material on other CD's. This is something I will never know."
1,San Francisco Video Adict,"I recently bought a 27"" JVC and have been extremely happy. Excellent quality at a reasonable price. I then decided to buy the AV20320 to use as a supplementary TV in the kitchen. Problem was I got a lemon that would only play channels 2-13. I brought it to the authorized repair facility and they could do nothing so Amazon, good customer service that it provides, has taken it back. Perhaps the lesson is not all Japanese audio-video products are faultless, but it is a real nuisance to get a lemon and a hassle to deal with."
3,"OK, poorly organized",This guide provides reasonable information on campgrounds. I found it hard to use for trip planning purposes and there is no index.
4,Guest artists=great music,"I don't know why this album is overlooked. The guest artists (Jame Burton, Sonny Landreth and Kenny Aranof)and song selections (Somewhere Where Love Can't Find Me and You Should Have Been There)are memorable. I'm not as fond of pop-friendly Marshall Crenshaw tunes. This album is a little edgier. I rate it 1/2 star over my next favorite Crenshaw album, Downtown."
2,Nurse Pants Look,they looked like a nursing uniform pants .. not attractive at all no style to them. would be nice if you are a nurse looking for some nice pants to wear with a uniform top.
1,Easy is not easy but difficult,"I have tried the easy level from different sources after finding that the example in the directions which was listed as medium was easier than the actual ones listed as easy. All the other sources I have tried, the easy is actually easy. I mention this because I found it very frustrating when trying to learn Su Doku and getting a feel for the strategy and then build on it. My initial thought was, if the easy level is this hard than what must the next level be like!"
1,Too Difficult For Beginners,"I still have not solved the first easy puzzle. I plan to burn this book in my backyard with an elaborate ceremony. The very first easy puzzle requires the most advanced techniques to solve. I have not even looked at the others. Give me a few Walmart specials to start with, just to see if I like the hobby to begin with!!!!!"
2,Easy puzzles way too difficult,"I read the full introduction, being new to sudoku. Thought I would have the tools from reading to certainly do the easy puzzles in this book, but found them way too brain-twisting. The puzzles were not a good followup teaching tool as way too difficult. I couldn't believe those puzzles were marked EASY even after reading a lot of these materials.So I would have to rate this as not a good sudoku book for anyone but more advanced. Just my humble opinion."
4,Nice little unit for the price,"This is a nice little RO filter, but as other reviewers have mentioned, the instructions are absolutely worthless. If you're somewhat knowledgeable about plumbing you should eventually be able to figure everything out. If not, here's a hint: The individual filters in this unit are connected with hoses held in place by quick connect fittings. If you've never worked with these before, here's an excellent video that explains everything you need to know -- [...]. (The section about quick connect fittings starts about 45 seconds in, but watch the whole video; the beginning explains a compression fitting, which is the type of fitting used to connect your filter to the water supply.)"
4,Skeleton Man,"In the book, Skeleton man, Molly has a confusing life. First, Molly was forced to stay at her uncle's house with her creepy uncle. Molly's parents had gone missing and she doesn't have any more family members so she had to stay with him. She was always suspicious of him and never trusted him. Second, Molly started having weird scary dreams. Molly would wake up during them and figure out that it wasn't a dream. Second, her uncle was always in his mysterious shed. She broke into his shed and found her parents in there trapped. Third, Molly doesn't feel safe at his house only at school. Molly trusts her teacher and is very scared to go home after the days at school are over especially on Fridays because that would mean she would have to stay there for the whole weekend. Finally, Molly has to deal with having not that many friends. Molly only has a few friends including the teacher. Skeleton man is a very interesting and weird book."
1,"Politically Biased, Author's diatribe","I got this book with high hopes for a window into the life of an every day Israeli. I was sadly, sadly dissapointed. It is more than obvious that the author wrote this book only to expouse his own political view points, and to lash out at every aspect of Israeli society with which he has a bone to pick.* He places the entire blame of the Intifadah on the assassination of Rabin* As such, he places the majority of the problems of Israel on anyone wearing a kippahDespite this, he manages to maintain an air of I'm-better-than-everyone-else throughout the majority of the book.I suggest you avoid this book, as it is not what you are expecting. This isn't a window into Israeli life, it's a window into the authors mind (read: politics)I hate being so negative, I don't even write reviews much. This one needed writing."
3,Not the best of it's kind...,A bit too politicized for my taste - why have value judgements of the settlers and the religious every other paragraph? Otherwise not too bad. [...]
1,Thomas L. Friedman he is NOT!,"I just finished this book. While reading it I found it a little disjunctive, a little disturbing. But it wasn't until I slept that I woke knowing what is wrong with it. Unlike Thomas Friedman, Mr. Horovitz doesn't mingle, as he admits, with Palestinians nor does he go into the West Bank or East Jerusalem, except occasionally as a journalist. That would be okay; what is not okay is the writer's quite unbelievable arrogance. He believes he might have saved Prime Minister Rabin from his horrid fate--if only he had been at the peace rally in Tel Aviv the night he was shot! He believes, or strongly suggests, that his wife single-handedly threw the last Israeli election--to Mr. Barak. Arrogance isn't interesting and neither is most of this book. An attitude lies beneath it that is faux macho and lacking artistic value."
2,"A flimsy, unimpressive book.","Flimsy. This book was once essential reading, but the works of Cunningham, the Farrars, and many others have left it far behind. These rituals are laughably bare compared to virutally any book on Wicca published in the 90's.It's nice to see how far the NeoPagan movement has come!"
4,who says hardcore is dead?,"i love this record...a nice follow up from their 'fall from grace' 7""...fast and aggressive are the two words which pop up in my head...nice sing alongs too....but for you metal heads out there, stay clear cause this is hardcore not metal. a very high praise goes to the bass player of ensign...a nice added touch of talent.... njhc"
2,"no illustrations, its better than nothing?","I'm glad ""Steam"" is available on Kindle (and free ain't bad either?), but I can't access the illustrations referenced in this book. The illustrations would shed more light on the topics discussed. There are text references made throughout, but no links to show the illustrations that surely were meant to accompany these lengthy descriptions of classic technology.I don't mind the older version if there can be a note attached to the Kindle store on this item to indicuate that you'll be looking at the 1927 version. Getting a more modern version even at a small price would be a great option to have. Right now, there's only one option."
2,Ghettotastic Print Job :(,"Content-wise, this text looks pretty good. Lots of details about the history of steam power. However, the publisher of this particular copy, the one with pictures of books on the front (ISBN 9781466275829), took absolutely no care in preparing a reasonable copy of the work. The outside margins are nonexistent, the illustrations are straight up missing, and the tables are written as text files but printed with a non-monospace font so they're pretty much unreadable. See: [...]. To top it off, the back cover has a description for a literary anthology completely unrelated to steam (""From Shakespeare's finesse to Oscar Wilde's wit,..."").I secretly find all this kinda hilarious, but I can't help but feel like I should've gotten something better for 30 bucks."
3,Printing problems,"The pages of the book have printing problems, for instance, page 3 has a vertical dark line."
5,shaver review,I am disabled and unable to use a blade razor. I find that Norelco meets my needs and that the replacement blades are as good as the originals. I found it easy to obtain them at a good price through Amazon.
4,long lasting! great product.,"So the manufacture recommended razor replacement is every 12 months. Pfff....try 120 months! That's right. After 10 years, I'm finally changing the razor on my Quadro. I love this razor and the blade lasted long! The 10 year old razor is still working but I can tell it's taking much longer to get a clean shave. The replacement is quick and easy done within minutes. The only down side is the cost."
4,Best price for replacement heads,"Looked all over town trying to find replacement heads for my electric razor. Plus search all over the internet only to find Amazon had the best price, fast delivery and great service."
2,Why was it opened ?,"I received the shaver heads and all 3 were opened before ! Is it new or used ! Wasn't happy about that ,especially for something used on my face !It was sliced open to get the 3 heads out !"
3,Norleco Shaver Heads,An excellent quality product. Had hoped to find the shaver heads at a cheaper price. The product came on time for Christmas.
5,better than original,I thought I had a close shave untill i purchased refill blades and combs from Amazon.Ordered on the 23rd and recieved order on the 29th.Boxed and packaged very nice.The results from the new blades: outperformed the original and i dont even use an electric shaveing lotion or gel.Wow!!! that was fast delivery and very quality replacement blades.I will definately use this service again.GREAT WORK AMAZON!
4,Works great!,"After SEVEN years, my husband decided it was finally time to replace the original blades that came with his Norelco. These work fantastic, as expected. They seem to provide almost as close of a shave as a razor blade. Overall, very pleased."
3,Required but overpriced,"Replacement heads are clearly neccessary. I did find that after a year, I got a superior shave when I replaced the heads. However, it is obnoxious to make this an item that costs upwards of $[...]. We know why they do it: because they can.It hardly seems as though that Norelco is ""giving away the razor to sell the blades"" because the razor ain't cheap.I do recommend the product. You will be getting a clearly substandard shave if you continue to shave with 2 year old heads. I just can't sit back and sing the praises of a $[...] product that ought to go for under $[...] even much less if it were available competitively."
3,Norelco Cutter replacment,"Finally replaced the shaving heads in my older Norelco shaver, this is after buying a brand new one that didn't work as well as my old worn out shaver.Well, I don't really see a lot of improvement with the new shaving heads, I assume they are better but my shave doesn't feel any different.My original Norelco shaver has to be ten or fifteen years old and still going strong. It looks like maybe I should try and different brand shaver.My Amazon experience was great, easy to order and my shipment was here in less time than if I had paid extra for shipping express."
2,Did not fit,"I have a Norelco Cool Skin that's about 4 years old and these replacement heads did not fit. They fit enough for everything to look right, but the blades did not have the room to rotate (so they obviously did not cut). The blades rubbed up against the underside of the round metal piece that glides against your face, and were only able to rotate spastically. I had to return and never knew why this didn't work - I definitely had the right razor for these blades. I ended up just buying a new razor for only $20 more."
2,Great for snow bad for ice,Great tool for removing snow from your car. Not so good for ice. The head broke off when trying to remove ice from the car and I don't think it was designed to withstand use as an ice scraper.
3,Good buy,THis is the first big name shampoo I've ever purchased. Its nice. Makes my hair feel smooth and silky. I won't keep buying it just because I didn't notice that big of a difference over the normal garnier that I use most of the time.
5,Great value on an anti-frizz product,"My hairstylist got me into this product. I've been using the Smooth Down Shampoo and Conditioner for a few months now, and unlike with other products, I don't find the need to rotate in different products. I use these over and over.The conditioner is light and keeps my hair from getting weighed down. I'm able to wash and condition with these products, style my hair straight, and leave it for 3 days before I need to wash it again. These products get it clean and keep it healthy enough to avoid the drying effects of washing every day.Give these a shot if you have color treated or just plain frizzy and dry hair."
3,Dart shafts,"I bought these to replace the plastic shafts that came with my set. The plastics were extremely fragile and were cracking on the first day. These aluminum shafts have a much better weight and feel, plus the obvious durability. The problem is that they seem to unscrew a bit from the base after a few throws, which gives it a less solid feel in the hand. It doesn't come all the way out, though, just a bit loose. I give it a quick tighten during play and it's fine again for a little bit.Not bad at all for the price."
2,Broke just after one year of use,"This blowdryer performed well for the first year, during which I used it approximately once a week, almost always on ""high."" (The high setting is very hot, though, and some may find it uncomfortable.) However, just after one year of use, I tried to use it on low one day, and it stuck there. Something inside came unhinged, and it will not turn off or switch to the high position. I cannot figure out how to get it apart to fix, so it is now largely useless to me."
4,Amost a five star rating,Excellent child bike seat!! I find it very safe and a confortable ride for both my 2 year old daughter and myself. The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because of the cheap fabric that tears at the seams after the first couple of rides. Even with this issue I recommend this seat highly.
4,the long corridor,enjoyed reading this book but it got a little slow moving at times. i usually love catherine cookson books and wouldbuy more of them.
5,bought mine for personal rather than lawn care - works fine,"I must confess, since I have never been desperate enough to try it, I cannot compare MY Norelco shaving experience with that of shaving with a &#65533;lawn trimmer&#65533;, &#65533;lawn mower&#65533; or for that matter even a &#65533;weed whacker&#65533; (regardless of brand), ALTHOUGH, at some point BEFORE discovering the Norelco electric shavers some 11 years ago, only common sense stopped me from considering such drastic alternative due to MY highly sensitive skin not getting along well with any of the available conventional alternatives of the time. Since I have been using Norelcos, my face no longer looks as if has been tenderized on regular basis. About the only gripe I have with Norelco is the relatively high cost of the replacement heads (approx $25). Since I bought my latest 5841 about 1 year ago it is safe to assume that I like this product."
3,good until broken,good pump while it worked (almost a year) and for as cheap as it is it's still not a bad buy.
1,Pretty flimsy,Worked a few times but then the metal started to bend and one of the pins came loose. I would not recommend this pump to anyone.
2,Broken after two year's very light use,"Not happy about it. After two year's very light use, the tube of the pump broke at the connetion to the pump. Air is leaking out from the tube. I guess that how long long a rubber tube can last? Not good quality."
1,Hose broke on 2nd use,"After reading the other reviews I knew that the hose was fragile, so I was very careful not to put any stress on the hose. Even so, the hose broke on the second use. I tried fixing it with duct tape, but to no avail. The pump itself seems sturdy enough and comfortable to use, but it is useless with a broken hose."
3,Conair HLM10R Hot Lather Machine,Works great but found it for much better price at a store. Tisk Tisk
1,Not Worth It,I read the reviews on hot lather machines and saw several high ratings for this product. I tried it and it never made the shaving cream hot enough. But it also never heated to the point that the green light came on (just a yellow light). So I got another machine and the same thing happened. Not worth it.
1,Where's the heat?,This machine does not provide HOT LATHER. It serves only as a dispenser for the shaving cream.
3,What kind of shaving cream should I use?,Recently purchased this product but cannot find a can of shaving cream without a warning to not use for warm later or near heat. Can anyone recommend a brand of shaving cream that is safe to use with this machine?
5,SHAVING CREAM HEATER,I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN A TIMELY MANOR AND AS OF NOW IT HAS CONTINUOUSLY WORKED WELL
2,Not to be given the day that you give birth,"I was handed this book the day that my daughter was born, when the doctor's suspected she had Down Syndrome. This book is informative to all the future obstacles that ""may"" be faced, but not something to hand to a new mother. I found this book to be very depressing and had to put it out of sight for several months. Even when a typical child is born, we don't know what types of medical issues that are going to be faced with, or the difficulties each family will have due to that child. I feel that this book focuses too much on the negative impact of Down Syndrome and not enough of how much enjoyment and happiness will be brought when each milestone is met. We are not even told that our children will meet all milestones just ""possibly"" at a slower pace. Babies with Down Syndrome can't be sterotyped, they will all fare differently since their genetics are all different, some smarter than others etc."
2,"Sharp shears, but too heavy and unbalanced","First off, these are super sharp shears, and if you're looking for a good at-home shear, then these are a good value. However, they're too bulky. I found them to be heavy and unbalanced in my hand, and the length is such that it's hard to get close in at the nape and around the ears. They would be fine for long-hair trims, but for mens cuts, as well as short haircuts on women and children, you'd have to switch to a smaller shear for the nape and exterior."
5,Great,"Although written in the 1970's and the art isn't great, I love reading this book to my daughter (age 3). It's written as if a child is speaking. It's fun and easy to read."
4,cd review,this cd came in a timely manner and as described . it was a nice addition to my cd collection . i thought i already had it and found out i did'nt .
2,most overrated metal album of all time,[come] on feel the noise and thunderbird are the only decent tracks on this album.the rest of the material is below average.it's beyond me why people consider this album a classic.
2,HEARTLESS,"The only single merit QUIET RIOT ever had was paving the way for guitarrist Randy Rhoads shine later in Ozzy Osbourne's outfit. QUIET RIOT ever played straight commercial songs, playing without any heart following the ugly glam mania that invaded the States in the eighties. This CD has two or three good tunes, the rest is horrible."
2,not what i expected...weak story,i think it wasnt that good sailormoon is a lot better than this though it had very silly scenes i liked mew the green haired the opening theme was not that bad the art was great the story line was not bad too i think other people will like it more...
3,someone is missing,"This book is called ""Missing Since Monday"" by: Ann M. MartinThe book is about a girl named Maggie, her brother Mike, and her little sister named Courtney. Maggie's parents are divorced and her dad got remarried.One day Maggie's dad and her step mom went on their honeymoon. Now Maggie and Mike have to take care of Courtney. The next day Maggie puts Courtney on the school bus and she never came back home that day. Now she is getting mystery phone calls, and she doesn't know what to do.Find out what will happen next.I recommend this book to people who like mystery books."
1,Bammer- The hillbilly hammer,"This tool worked some of the time. Mostly, it drove nails in about half way, jammed, and mis-fired. I called Jackson, TN when the Bammer stopped working altogether. The gave me a service number to call. After being put 'on hold' for 20 minutes, they automatically hung up.The corporation I work for has an annual operating buget of $150 mil. We won't be ordering tools from Porter-Cable. I need dependable service, and the Porter-Cable 6020P BAMMER Fuel Cell just doesn't provide it."
3,Norelco replacement heads,"The original heads lasted a very long time, they were made in the USA, the second replacement set were purchased thru Amazon, and were made in either Taiwan or China, and they did not last at all. Got very dull very quickly, now this set is made in Holad, lets see how long they last. Hopefully they will be much better than the second set."
1,Didn't work,Said it would work for the shaver my husband has and didn't. Just through it in the trash. For the price of the heads one can almost buy a new shaver. So that is what I will continue to do without any compaints from my husband that we should be buying heads. Wrong.
4,Norelco's replacement shavers,Work extremely well and last about a year before they start scratching the face.Leon
2,Wasted money,I replaced the dull baldes and new heads were installed. I was disappointed in the results after shaving. I would have been better off purchasing a new razor.
5,Norelco 6887XL Deluxe Quadra Action,Best Norelco product I have used.Great shave. Easy to clean. The actual number of minutes left on a charge is very helpful.
4,"A Multi Level Collage: Meville, Columbus, and Metcalf","Genoa is an unusual book. Paul Metcalf engages Herman Melville, Christopher Columbus, and other historical figures in an amazingly parallel streams of fiction and reality which together form their own other picture like three different musical instruments whose voices blend to create a fourth. The picture of Carl's progressive breakdown is sad to see. The war moments are very disturbing. What are the choices made that lead him to where he ends? Paul Metcalf is something rare an original writer. You won't find too many voices like his. Pound used the technique of quotes in The Cantos, using John Adams' writings and Homer, etc. Paul applied this to prose masterfully."
5,Excellent Film,"You will not be disappointed by this film. Great cast, great quotes, and great acting. RIP Edward Woodward."
4,historical note,"i enjoyed this movie tremendously. the acting was superb. there is little to add to the other reviewers' comments about the film.however, about five years or so after the movie was released, i happened to read an article in the Los Angeles Times, an interview with the man who wrote the book on which the movie was based. between the time he researched, wrote and published the book, and the release of the film, the time limit set by the british secrecy acts on information about the boer war expired. the author then had access to materials that had not been available when he was writing his book. in the los angeles times interview, he stated that the then newly released information proved that the trial was, in fact, completely necessary and not, as he had originally supposed and as had originally seemed, without the military information, a political or expedient act. i believe he even called morant a psychotic.none of which detracts from the film as a film."
5,"""Buy this movie!""","If you are interested in military history or enjoy movies with a good story line, than this is the film for you. This movie is based on a true story that took place during the ""Anglo-Boer"" war (1899-1902).The acting is incredible, the story line is gripping and this is the type of film you never get tired of. I highly recommend it."
3,Not a poor system but....,"My friend have bought this jvc system. The sound is average and the two 8 inch subwoofer really pump bass in a small room but in family room, the bass is ugly. 110 watts per channel for subwoofer. I don't believe it. My old scak29 of Panasonic with 70 watts per channel for subwoofer give a better bass.This system has 330??? watts of power. The sound is good, not to bad. 3 cd and many option for choosing the sound quality. Bright display and the desing is ugly for more person and beautifull for another. You like it or you not like. Personally, i don't like it with the big button (fisher price desing). Why jvc has not keep the rolling pannel?The speakers are big and the giga tube on the top reproducing a quiet bass for a small room.Not to bad system, sound and built quality is average. For the same price and the better sound sc-ak44 of panasonic or mhc-gx40 of sony are better. 300 watts for ak-44 and 240 watts for gx-40(subwoofer include)"
1,Misinformation!!!,"Will have to return. Amazon site only states to be used in outside light socket. Box it came in states ""Warning -operate with specially designed socket, otherwise bulb may rupture. Nothing here on site states that. It states on box to ""NEVER install into a regular socket"". It has to be a ""comparable ballast & fixture only."" One rated ""to withstand a 4000 volt pulse"" AND has an ""ANSI designation IDENTICAL to that found on the lamp outer glass bulb."" This is all a little more complicated than what I was looking for!"
1,The second most poorly written book I have ever read.,"The information in this book is interesting but scattered throughout the book between poorly written chapters an outlandish plot and horrifically stilted conversations. This book was recommended to me so I have picked it up twice to try to read it. The first time I wasn't able to make it past the first 2 chapters. The second time I tortured myself through more than half of the book. I can't believe that some one would actually publish this author, let alone several books by him. If you want good information relating to the Book of Mormon go to FARMS and Hugh Nibley. If you want good LDS fiction read Orson Scott Card and Gerald Lund. Skip Keith Terry altogether."
1,"There are much better, cheaper irons out there","I have very thick, wavy hair, and this iron did NOT work on it at all. It doesn't open very wide, the combs pulled my hair, and the steam option just made my hair frizz. I gave it to Good Will. On the recommendation of my stylist, I found a much better iron for much cheaper -- the Hot Tools Professional 170 Watt iron works great and does my hair quickly. I can iron all my hair in only a few minutes, it gets really straight, and it doesn't damage my hair."
5,Typically Cristina!!!,"This is a wonderful book that not only contains some of Cristina's best recipes, it also demonstrates who Cristina is and how much she loves her family. It is wonderful reading for anyone that wants to prepare a holiday feast or just a quiet dinner at home. Cristina's flair and zest for life comes through loud and clear. A+++++++"
1,I did not like it at all!,I think you don't need so many pages to explain the ideas in the book. Too long and too repetitive. You better read some other book about Risk management that talks about VaR in a more concise and enjoyable way. I think this book is full of wind.
1,Don't Do it!!!,This cover is very expensive and will not keep your tools or cargo dry water leaks through each slot its like the bed has no cover. At $980.00 its a complete rip off the company customer service is a joke they even have voice mail boxes that are full so you can't complain and just do not care.! the video they show is untrue this cover is not even close to stopping the outside elements from getting in
1,Still looking,I needed a water resistant 900MHz phone to use around the pool.When I saw the Uniden water-resistant WX1377 I orderd it. When I hooked it up it had a loud HUMMMMM in it. I returned it to Amazon with an exchange. The new phone did the same thing. I called the Uniden factoy and learned this phone has a factory grounding deffect. The Uniden folks told me I should return it to the place of purchase and get my money back . I did. I am still looking for a 900MHz phone to use around the pool.
2,get what u pay 4,Listed as a refurb. Cost <$30. Dead battery. Had to buy another battery for $10. Caller ID doesn't work. Phone itself rings and works.
2,Wrong item sent,"I ordered wxi377 but they sent the wxi477 without notifying me. At the time, I could have bought the 477 phone for $40 cheaper than the 377 phone. They did however refund me $20. Use caution when ordering from this co.."
4,Uniden WXI377 900 MHz Water-Resistant Cordless Phone with Caller ID,Love the phone. Only wish it had a light on the key pad.Great by the hot tub.
2,Turtle Ramp,"This product didn't work for our turtle. It came exactly are described, and fit into the tank well. We found the turtle would never go up the ramp. We tried placing him on the platform, and he always would jump right off. We left it in place for about a week, and ended up replacing it with the old smaller shelf that we had been using."
3,Only commercial option for big turtles; not durable,"I'm about to purchase my third one of these. The reason I've used up two is because the traction fabric wears off fairly quickly. One turtle even took a bite out of the loose fabric... yikes. The fabric becomes hard to clean and despite my efforts becomes a haven for bacteria and algae.Nevertheless, it's the largest ramp I can find for my two RES turtles, who are about 16 years old and will capsize the other commercial ramps on the market. If I stacked rocks to create a similar crawl-up ramp, I'd lose valuable space for the turtles underwater -- perhaps a third of my 80 gallon tank."
3,Not his best,"It is good. I enjoyed the references to local places as I live in northern California. My favorite book of his remains ""The Road to Wellville""."
3,"sad, funny, a little silly","If you think TC Boyle often goes too far over top, but still want to read something by him, I suggest this book. It's the most gritty, (truly) of his work so far. The characters engage in interesting activities,but their silly conversations often stop the story cold. Worth the time and money, however."
4,"Required Read for Physical, Mental, and Spiritual Well Being","Wow! Mr. Stuart presents the whole ball of wax in an interesting manner that is easily digested and very challenging. His sensitivity about contempory issues helps one to examine conventional wisdom about spirituality, illness and death.Bravo, I hope to read more from this inspiring author."
4,Nice Piece of Recursive Story Telling,"A surprisingly good story -- and I'm not a manga fan (although I'd like to be one). It's not a classic like Castle of Cagliostro -- now there's a movie! And it's certainly more hard edged. But, it works, even if the narrative device that is used gets perhaps a little overused, and is one of the few compelling dramas in manga I've found. Good stuff."
1,AWFUL,it was SO BAD...all of them were ugly..the story was stupid and stilly..its not worth buying..rent and then buy it if u liked it..i regret buyin its dvd
1,wake me up when its over,"Well sorry, but this was tedious beyond belief. I've seen some good Anime and bought this on the recommendations of other reviewers. I'm writing this, my first review to warn against blindly believing everything you read. To be honest, I can't remember an awful lot of what happened in the film because it was so boring. You might like it but my friends and I were utterly unimpressed. Roll on Akira on DVD..."
2,Get a story that gives a meaning,This was one of the first manga/anime movies I ever saw and was dissapointed. So if you never have seen a manga/anime movie don't start with this one.
3,Perfect Blue,"Lost in translation is all I can say for this. Few of us were ever actors, few of us were ever pop stars, and few of us are beautiful enough to pose nude in magazines. And if you're reading this, chances are you're not Japanese. To me, this film fails in its American translation. It's one of those true-life animes. Yet it's very hard to get into, and when you do finally slip into the storyline, you're jarred back out by one of the violent images that come along (a rape scene, a couple of murder scenes, and a woman cutting herself wide open when she slips and falls onto broken glass). If you must have this, I'd recommend watching it in the Sub version, as reading it takes you more into the story than simply watching it. And attempt to have an unbiased look at the true-life storyline. In the end, however, this movie would have been better as a live-action film."
3,I really wanted to like it,"After I saw Millenium Actress and Tokyo Godfathers, I had the highest hopes for other anime by Satoshi Kon.I guess he just set the bar so high with those movies that even he can't always meet the standard he created. Perfect Blue is watchable. It says some interesting, even disturbing things about what it means to change. It just didn't have the impact on me that the other movies did."
5,"""Excuse me, who are you?""","The first time I saw this movie and heard those five little words, I got an eerie chill down my spine. Having bought this movie only Sunday, June 18th, I was hooked from the first scene to the very end. The cliff-hanging suspense, snappy dialouge, and beutiful art kept me glued to the screen without moving once through the entire movie. I don't recomend this movie for anyone younger than me, 15, because of the nude scenes, very detailed nude scenes. If you're over 15 then you should really try this movie!"
3,"Interesting concept, poor execution","Perfect Blue is a decent film, but there are many other mature animes out on the market that are far superior. The ideas are compelling; the execution is disappointingThe whole issue of Japanese gender roles are taken out and examined... Not very uplifting, since it reinforces an idea that women are simply valued for their phycial attributes -- thus the older woman wants to become the younger one. Also, a ""cute"" pop singer is more valued than a talented actress with some depth.The concept of seeing things through the eyes of someone going through a nervous breakdown/personality disorder is interesting, but not terribly original. However, the art work is excellent. Also, many will find the movie repetitive as scenes are repeated for added significance and several images are blatantly regurgitated.A good film to rent, but a collector would do well to think twice before purchasing it."
5,gave me the most options,Two chapters in this book saved me a lot of time and money. The travel strategies chapter help me to plan a trip to Yosemite at the last minute during the peak season. The lodging and camping chapters were far better than other guides giving me many more options and describing them well. I recommend this book.
4,good album,"this is ignites earlier stuff, came out prior to call on my brothers, pretty good but totally different from the first albmum which is what got me hooked on ignite in the first place. this is zoli's first appearance with the band on an album. zoli is ok, kinda takes away from the grittieness of the earlier stuff but whatever. solid album anyhow. Ignite gets more polished and produced on their albums which is ok for some people. this album sound a little different than Scarred for life which is cool because its nice to hear bands do something different."
5,"Excellent company, excellent warranty","This game controller has a macro feature that can do several functions at once instead of pushing several buttons to achieve the same outcome. The Matcatz controller is totally compatible with the GameCube console. Don't feel you have to pay more to get the GameCube controllers. We've had this one for four years without a problem. Just recently my son had trouble with the figures in the game moving on their own, so I called the 800 number I found at [...] They sent me a new controller within a week. I couldn't be more pleased with the product or with customer service. I would buy again from this company."
1,"Great for small hands, but too fragile.","The Microcatz MicroCon game controller for the Nintendo GameCube, made for people with smaller hands, is two-thirds the size of the brand-name Nintendo GameCube controller. The Microcatz controller has all the features of the regular Nintendo GameCube controller, including rumble (vibration), but adds a macro feature to record one set of keystrokes for rapid playback. The MicroCon is great for children, and even works well for adults looking for that split-second improvement in responsiveness from less finger-travel time.Unfortunately, the Microcatz MicroCon for the Nintendo GameCube is a fragile product. Both of my MicroCon controllers failed within a few months of purchase. As a result, I recommend that consumers avoid this product, and purchase brand-name regular-sized Nintendo GameCube controllers instead."
1,Bad news,I bought a couple of there products before and every time I got one within a week my system burnt out. I DO NOT recommend this controller
3,Advertising & Romance 3+,"Set in the fast passed, creative world of advertising, Second Chance is a warm & snuggley romance that is sure to please to the first time around. A great beginning for this new author!"
4,"An Exciting, Romantic Read","I had never read a romance novel before, so I didn't know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. While it concentrates on the relationship between two people (Nick and Chance), there are a couple of great subplots also. I really enjoyed the look into the advertising world of Chance and Nick.The characters were very likeable and true to life. There wasn't anything that wasn't plausible, and I loved this aspect of the story.If you want an entertaining, good read that will put a smile on your face then this is a book for you."
2,Very disappointing effort,"Received this for Christmas and was excited about it; after viewing the dvd's, I can only say that I'm extremely disappointed. Very little - if anything- is ""new"" here; in fact, you could get lots more useful information by subscribing to a golf instruction magazine. My package did come with a putting training aid - which was a bonus, but it can't help the ""staged"" interaction and stale lessons. Also, this instrutional DVD is now over 5 years old (when he was still Tiger Woods' coach). This set my be satisfactory to a complete beginner, but most golfers should pass on this one."
4,Spectroscopy Analysis,"This is a good spec book, however I feel it has gone downhill in some aspects when compared to previous editions. However, overall it's one of the best of its kind."
5,Great Resource,"This book has been a great resource for me in the identifiication of organic compounds. I purchased this book to brush up on the theory and interpretation of organic compouds via Infrared Spectrometry and Nuclear Resonance Spectrometry. So far, I haven't been disappointed. If you need a quick review, or an in-depth look into any of the spetrometric techniques, this is a great book to have. There are also practice problems to help strengthen your spectral knowledge."
3,a good book with a series useful data bases,"it is our required textbook for organospectroscopy course. it provides a series of useful databases, which is good for future resaerch.however, the explaination is not so detailed with some information or some typy of coumpounds missing.and i wish it can provide soft-cover edition and therefore, be much cheaper."
3,Organic student,"This book is truly intended as more of a reference for experienced students in the field and does not adequately explain basic principles for complete beginners. For use as a reference, one has to know exactly what they're looking for as there are few tables that generalize the spectra by their organic compound class. The beginnings of the chapters should give a simple explanation of the overall spectrometry technique employed so that beginners can learn why each is so important in the field."
5,Best Dolls recordings from Summer '72,"Not as in the editorial reviews January, this one was done in the summer of '72 at Blue Rock Studios in NYC. It captures all the energy of the Dolls at their peak when they were the darlings of the Mercer Arts Center Glitter Rock Scene."
5,History at its very best,"I first read this book back in the late 1970s when it was first published and since then I've read nearly every book by David Howarth. He is the consumate popular historian, who makes history really come alive for the reader.1066 is probably his best book and is certainly my favourite book of history. He takes the reader through the main events of that year, introduces the major players in the story he is unfolding, and speculates about their motives and on the way history has dealt with the story (ie history comes down to us as told by the winners).He makes people like King Harold, William the Bastard and the amazing Harald Hardrada of Norway real for the reader. At the end you are left wondering how English history might have been if just one of the events he descibes had turned out differently.A truly wonderful book - history at its very best."
4,1066: The year of the Conquest,Very readable history. Shows how naive we Americans are because we have been so poorly taught real history.
4,Engrossingly fills in the gaps,"This book entirely took me by surprise. Although the year 1066 is a genuine ""household name"", few are aware of the tragic (for Anglo-Saxons) series of coincidences and misfortunes that unfolded in this dramatic year.He is up-front about his English bias, but this should not offend the Normans who, of course, have morphed or were subsumed into a complicated new definition of Englishness in the intervening thousand years. Anyway, Howarth goes out of his way to marvel at their achievement.If anybody comes off looking bad, it is the Pope of a thousand years ago, but this requires acceding to one of the many speculations which Howarth advances. A group that requires no speculation to look bad are the English themselves, who, having fought as well as anybody up to the moment of Harold's death, lay down the whole country to a tiny army after losing at Hastings. The wages for this capitulation were the three hundred thousand who perished during William's reign."
4,Fantastic Razor...don't know about that price!,"I went from shaving with all sorts of face-cutting straight razors, including dual blade & triple blade, to an electric razor. Wow! what a difference. Why didn't anyone tell me how much better this is?"
1,feeling bad about buying ... feeling good,"Very wordy, simplistic view of depression.If you weren't depressed before reading this book, you will be after!"
2,One sided view,"Alot of good info, but Dr. Burns basically says that antidepressants are basically useless and don't really work. He seem to push the therapy side of treatment, but downplayed the medical side of depression."
5,Feeling Good : The New Mood Therapy,A must read for anyone suffering from anxiety disorders and or depression. Has alot to say re current medications - vs Cognative Behavior Therapy
5,Fantastic book. It's helpful and practical.,I read this book years ago and found it very helpful. I'm a teacher and have used many of its ideas over the years. Its info on self esteem is very valuable.
5,Outstanding!,The book arrived sooner than expected and in better condition than expected. You just can't do better than that.
5,"Perfect compliment to any AA, 12-step, recovery program!","Great read! Very straightforward. I'm only on page 70, and already I've found myself using the techniques outlined in the book.**Especially great for a recovering addict in a 12-step program**To be able to heal, we need to be receptive of new ideas, and even criticism of our existing idea. This book builds your mental toughness.Loving it more with every read and action I take to build my self-esteem!"
2,Only made things worst for me,"Didn't really help me, which is a shame 'cause I had high hopes for it. It's a very think-y self help method, and for those of us who tend to overthink and worry - it might end up burdening our tired mind even more. Fairly long (650 pages), and quite repetitive. I found that in my case meditation was the way to go. Hope this helps others out there."
1,Skeptical,"Anyone reading ""Feeling Good"" or any of Burns' other books (or books by his fellow CBT practitioners, eg, Aaron Beck and Martin Seligman) should approach with some skepticism. I've read several of Burns' books. He's a good writer, and I am sure that many find CBT helpful. However, my guess is that the chief advantage of CBT is that it teaches depressed persons how to mask their depression. I believe that CBT's techniques simply add a layer of positive thinking on top of an underlying depression. The patient learns to give the kinds of answers that the therapist wants to hear. I'd be grateful to hear from others about their experiences with CBT."
4,Nice intro to cognitive behavior therapy.,"It's a long book but I think it's a good one if you want to read about cognitive behavior therapy. I'd like to have seen a wider array of different problems solved using this therapy. However, not to crab too much about a 1980's blockbuster."
2,Dry read and condescending,"Having gone through dialectical behavior therapy (similar to cognitive behavior therapy) and reading other books, I can say this isn't the best resource. First, it was a dry read for me. I couldn't finish the book.I would recommend the Dialectical Behavior Therapy Workbook instead to help you make concrete changes in your life to help you create a happier life. Of course, it can be embarrassing to carry around a large workbook that screams ""I go to therapy because I have lots of problems"".So another more ""socially acceptable"" book is Happier by Tal Ben-Shahar. He writes from a personal perspective and isn't condescending."
2,Mistake ...,"... even after reading the above reviews I decided to give this book a shot. Bad idea. There are a few typos in the book that are annoying, but not really enough to lead you completely astray. Unfortunately that is about as good as the book gets. There is a complete lack of really good visual aids, diagrams, pics, and step by step ""how-to's"". Carla Rose also will use terminology that isn't explained until later on, making things more confusing. Additionally all the screen shots are in Mac, not Windows, which may or may not effect the examples. This book is not for the beginner. I would look else where."
1,Maybe 24 Days,Another book where the author is tech savy and assumes the beginner already knows something about photoshop. Many basic steps are left out or assumed and this makes learning and moving on to following chapters almost impossible. Not for teaching yourself if you are new to adobe photoshop.
2,Way outdated,"This book was published in 1996. It's almost ten years old. If you're working with a version of AIX newer than that, you should probably get a more up to date book. It's also way overpriced for something so ancient."
1,This book is the difficult part of the man pages.,You know how the man pages start easy with a description and ends easy with it's examples? Well this book is not that. It is more like the middle part of the man pages that only the person who wrote them would understand. This is my opinion and that is why I am returning this book.
3,Roman Empire,"It is a boring read, but a great reference book to the decline of the Roman Empire. I can make good use of this book in my studies of ancient civilization."
3,Great Book But Kindle Maps Are Worthless,"I bought this as a Kindle daily deal for $1.99. I love reading history and was glad to see this book offered as a daily deal. Unfortunately, the maps are an important feature of the book and don't display well on either the e-ink Kindle or on the Fire.Although you can enlarge them in either version, the resolution is so poor that you can't really read them. I don't use Kindle for PC and don't know if the maps would be readable on the Kindle for PC version but on the actual Kindle device they are almost worthless. At the daily deal price, I'm satisfied with my purchase but at full price I would have felt ripped off and don't recommend the Kindle edition of this book."
4,Elusive,We couldn't find this product anywhere. My wife just was not satisfied with other types of curling irons. You saved the day.
1,do not buy this curling iron!,"I wanted a curling iron for overseas travel -- this one is advertised as DUAL voltage and 220 convertible -- I got it overseas and lo and behold, it is absolutely NOT dual voltage -- what a waste of money and not having this available overseas left me high and dry -- return policy is too cumbersome so I am stuck with a falsely advertised product on Amazaon with no options left!! Will think twice about purchasing anything from Amazon for now on!"
3,"some pluses, some minuses = not such a bad deal",Rarely do I go cheap on things that have to do with my hair but I wanted to try out a new size barrel without making a huge commitment so I gave this one a try.Pros:heats up quicklythe barrel and clip hold even my thinner hair tightlygets hot enough to produce a nice curl without burningcool tip makes holding at certain angles easier.Cons:the collar that regulates the temp broke - it is stuck in the temp range I wanted it in so no need to move it but that could be a bigger problem if I wanted varying tempssometimes takes several presses of the on button to get it to turn onno auto turn offFor what I paid I think this is an acceptable choice; if you are looking for something that will last I'd suggest looking elsewhere though.
5,great curling iron,This heats up nice and fast and I like the adjustable heat settings. Nice big barrel to give my hair some volume.
1,Straighter than before!,I decided to ignore the other reviews thinking it couldn't be as bad as what people said. This curler made my really straight hair straighter than before I started curling it. It maybe would curl my ends if I used enough hairspray and held it in the curl for a long time. Also the cord is not very long and the tip (as other reviewers have said) is pretty hot to hold on too. Do not purchase
3,Used it only twice!,I absolutely love this conair instant heat curling iron! I ordered it on amazon because of the great price. It did not come in the packaging I'm used to seeing in stores but figured it may have just changed since my last curling iron purchase (last year). The first time I used it it worked great. The second it kept turning off or shorting out on me. I changed outlets and still the problem continued.I would recommend this curling iron to a friend but perhaps not through the internet.
5,"Great band that is not around any more, unfortunately.","There are some powerful tunes on this cd. If someone out there buys this one, they won't be let down. Even better yet, buy Seemless, one of their other releases. It is a masterpiece."
4,Don't belive everything you read,"Man, this album has some bad reviews.Ok, this album would have been much more highly acclaimed if it had come out in 1983, instead of 1989, but i still really like it. This album IS 80'S SYNTH POP! It is not the same techno stuff that Underworld released in the 1990's. These guys have been around for a long time. Back in 1984 (or maybe 83) they Karl Hyde and Rick Smith were in a band called Freur. They made cheesy 80's music. Maybe you might remember a song called ""Doot Doot"". That's them! Or ""Hey Ho Away We Go"" or ""Devil in Darkness"". This 80's music continues with Underworld's first 2 albums, Underneath the Radar and Change the Weather.This album is good though. I like it better than Underneath the Radar (which often gets much better reviews), and would highly recommend it to anyone that's a fan of 80's pop music."
2,Disappointed that protagonist ended up being a boy,"The book on its own is fine, but when I recently read an article that said the authors had originally intended the protagonist to be a girl but changed their minds because they ""learned that boys will read about boys and girls will read about both boys and girls"", I was very disappointed. That kind of thinking will contribute to ever minimizing girls and women. Why not have featured a girl protagonist and worked a little harder to have made that character interesting to both boys and girls?"
5,A Great Family Movie for All Ages,"Note: Your ""helpful"" votes are appreciated. ThanksThis is the kind of movie I wish they would make more of. Robert Duvall and Michael Cane are men with a shady--though adventuresome--past when their nephew comes into their lives.The boy (Haley Joel Osment), who is left at his uncle's ranch by his mother, soon finds the home that he always wished he had. His uncles even order a lion through the mail, and in a series of flashbacks, we learn about the fantastic adventures of the two men.I don't like to tell too much about movies, but I will highly recommend this one. I love down-home movies that bring out the best in America."
4,Great actors make this movie a good one,"OK, OK...the story is not told as well as it could be, either because of editing or because, as another reviewer suggested, the filmmakers were making it up as they went along. The ending was also a bit heavy-handed. We didn't need to be clouted over the head like that to see that Hub and Garth were just who they claimed to be. But the powerful central theme of the story comes through loud and clear. And it is that way because of the really good acting put in by Osment, Duvall, and Caine. NOBODY plays the old curmudgeon better than Robert Duvall - watch Open Range and you can see him in this role again. Caine counterbalances him very well, and Osment's acting as the bewildered youngster just blew me away. This movie is a really great family movie with action, adventure, eccentric old dudes, and true love that never dies. I have no problem recommending this for anyone and will likely buy this one for my home collection."
5,"Utterly Brilliant, Subtle Detail, Heartwarming","I have watched this DVD several times, and each time I find new details that enthrall.This is a truly heartwarming movie that I used to push back against the crushing weight of reality, a reality I do not control.The two super-actors are at their best, but the young man who stars as the son of the gad-about lady is the real star. His smile, his behavior, are Oscar material.Don't miss the dogs, the pig, and the lion. This is a ""top ten"" movie."
5,Our favorite,"This is the only movie I have ever seen at least 20 times and everyone we have shown it to loves it as well. You will laugh and laugh. The dogs are the best, the idealism is better than childhood, the actors are superb. I even went out and tracked down all of the music! If you love a good story, then you'll drop everthing and buy this film."
4,Lots of fun,"If you're looking for a movie that's heartwarming, full of clean fun, (sometimes silly), this is it! Entire cast is wonderful, Duvall is fantastic!"
5,Great movie that has been terribly underrated!,"This movie is about a boy who was dumped with his two uncles, whom he had never met, by his irresponsible mother. While he is with them he is captivated by the stories of their youth and eccentric ways. In the process, he learns about love, life, priorities, and how to be a man. You will laugh and cry and watch this movie again and again!"
2,defective DVD,"The DVDs were delivered in a timely manner, however one of the DVDs was so scratched that we were unable to view it. We ordered 2 copies; one for us and one as a gift. Luckily we opened the defective one."
2,Secondhand Movie,"There were a few times when I was sorely tempted to turn it off, but I thought it would get better. I was wrong. I always enjoy Michael Caine and Robert Duvall, but this one was just too much -- or should I say, too little. Caine's southern accent sounded more like southern England to me. HJO seemed like he was doing a paint-by-numbers performance (""Cue the crying! ACTION!"") and his looks as he grows older seem more and more suited to doing a bio-pic about the life of a young Barney Rubble. Then we have our supporting cast of your typical Disney-movie types -- the young punks straight out of 'Happy Days'; the wacky wind-up relatives, etc. They all looked and sounded like refugees from a typical Disnelyand attraction.I suppose this movie is OK for kids, but it isn't a movie adults -- or even mildly intelligent teens -- will want to suffer through."
1,Ripped off,I feel I have been ripped off. The only disk within the case was the special features. The actual movie disk is nowhere to be found
4,Wonderful growing up story,"What a delightful movie beautifully shot, written and acted - full of swash and buckle and old geezers fulfilling their bucket list. And what a bucket! Loved the schlumpy house, the corn field and the great cartoons. Michael Caine and Robert Duvall in a tot'ly new set of roles. They must have had a ball making this. A must have ""feel good"" flick. Oh, and ""the kid gets it all""."
4,A Sensational Movie,"Wow! What a sensational surprise! I had never heard of this film. A friend of mine rented it. It's a very warm, witty, funny, tear-jerker of a coming of age story, with more than its share of surprises. Bookcased by Michael Caine and Robert Duval (two of the greatest actors of our time), Haley Joel Osment proves he is indeed coming of age as an actor. He was magnificent. Kyra Sedgewick was wonderful in a part that made her easy to dislike. But the two veterans proved you just can't beat experience. You have to wonder why this film wasn't better promoted or better marketed. It's a real winner!!!"
4,Good family flick,"It's often hard to find a good family movie that is both entertaining and yet not offensive. This movie delivers in both ways. It is indeed a bit on the corny side, the characters are somewhat over the top, however, as a light hearted melodrama it works well.Osment is definitely at a transitional stage, and in a couple of places in this film his acting seemed forced, but being that the film is a coming of age movie, it didn't hurt that much. As to whether this is the kind of movie to own, it's hard to give it a real strong ""yes you'll want to see it over and over"" type of recommendation but seeing as it's hard to get a movie to entertain such a wide age range it's probably a keeper."
5,Another Michael Caine Masterpiece,"I have been a fan of Michael Caine ever since I saw Alfie, years ago. He is always good, sometimes great. SecondHand Lions is no exception. How a guy with a Cockney accent (as in Alfie) could become a Texan (very convincingly) is amazing to me. But then, in The Cider House Rules, he was the typical New Englander, so why am I surprised?This movie is great, from any point of view. It even demonstrates a novel way of catching fish - one I never thought of. And all of this in the context of a young kid essentially abandoned by his mom to his two uncles, who reluctantly decide to take him on, and end up profiting in wisdom by their accepting him into their lives."
2,Very Late,This product did not arrive until 3 weeks after the shipping date and it was not an easy process when I went to check on it. I felt like I was sent in circles.
2,This movie made absolutely no sence...,"...and I find it very hard to categorize! It's a some kind of surreal drama, sometimes odd as a fable, one hour longer than it has to be (serious!), and easiest described as a movie not quite going anywhere -it's like you are waiting for the story to begin, and after a long gasp it is over -and you have no idea what you have spend one hour and fifty minutes on.Not that it is horrible, but it's not good. Three talented actors, including two senior-legends hardly do much acting at all -and their roles requires nothing but one look on their faces, and no emotions are shown at all during one hour and fifty minutes..! It's the strangest movie I've seen so far this year -and I'd recommend you to do something else instead.Warning : It's not in the category of ""Grumpy old men 1 or 2"" in case you wondered -this is very, very different and far from being comparable!"
5,Filled a hole . . .,"I had happily gave my DVD of this movie to friends , as a family movie that I highly recommend! I've missed it so much I had to get me another. It's one of the few movies that I enjoy enough to watch again!"
5,A Neglected Masterpiece,"What a shame that this picture was so poorely promoted. It is one of the best movies ever done, anywhere. It demonstrates briliantly that wonderfull, credible works can be done without tiresome and exagerated special effects. It shows that weird has nothing to do with dirty. And most important, this is a movie about most of men being fundamentaly as God created them: good."
2,"New book, old yarn","I am an experienced knitter, and am not pleased with the book. There are two items I was interested in making, the pig and the large teddy bear. The yarn requirement for the pig was off -- it called for one skein of the main color, but really needed 1 skein plus a couple yards. The yarn recommended for the large bear is a discontinued color. While it is possible to use a different yarn with the same gauge, it will not be the bear in the photo. I am very hesitant to try any other patterns in the book."
5,John Wayne Collection,Of all John Wanes movies this is one of my favorite. Not only does it have John Wayne but Donna Reed now what could you ask for. I love this movie so much I watch it often & each time it gets better. So many GOOD actors in it & such a great love story. Fact is my copy is getting bad & I'm going to have to get another one myself.I can not say enough how great this movie is.
3,Humanism Along the Way,"Trouble, collegiate and personal, meets graced optimism in St. Anthony's (and Father Rector Charles Coburn's) faltering venture in classical higher education as Coach Wayne (pursued by protagonist Reed) tackles real problems with ""reel"" banter and plan-in-reserve. Chuck Connors ably assists light-hearted scheme to save all as nostalgia reigns and life again turns to academic pursuits. There's enough truth in the myth to make it resound in the souls of alumni/aeworld-wide."
4,The Forester Sisters greatest Hits,"I listen to music every day it is my business to listen because I do a Country Music Radio show once a week. I don't think our Female Artists are getting as much airplay as they deserve, although this is slowly changing for the better. The Forester Sisters came to my attention through a single track ""Lyin' In His Arms Again"". The first time I heard these girls harmonising together I knew I was listening to a unique talent. I bought their ""Greatest Hits"" album and I love it.I have just bought their current album. I am sure other listeners will enjoy the Forester Sisters as much as I am."
3,Not to shabby,Does about the same job as any regular 3 headed norelco. Although the floating heads does a closer shave than ones without. I also like the convenience of the gel dispenser.Con:1. The plastic back cover is very fragile. Cracks easily.2. Inconvenience of the trimmer which requires the entire head to be removed.3. Can ONLY be used as cordless (due to docking charger). Can't shave while it's plugged in like my older model.
4,Great choice for men's socks,"My husband loves these socks and requested more for Christmas. He wears them all the time and especially likes the way they feel when he wears boots, either work boots or casual boots. The wool is not scratchy, the socks launder well, and they have a medium cushion for comfort. It wicks moisture away from your foot, so there is minimal odor. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because there is no sizing chart on the ordering information. I ordered a Large just guessing. The socks came and the sticker on the packaging says US Mens: 9-11.5 My husband wears a 9.5 so thankfully a Large was the right size. I hope this helps someone else. I don't know why Amazon cannot include the number sizes in parentheses next to the S, M, and L. It sure would help. BTW, I ordered these in the color gray, not knowing exactly what kind of gray it was. I am very happy with the color - it is super neutral and would go easily with jeans or khakis."
3,Interesting !,"This is not the first book of Nora Roberts that i have read. Despite the catching plot created with intriguing suspens and romance. The book failed to have a deep impact. Although, i would still prefer reading it again, over any other book of any other writer."
1,Offensive to Christians,"I was so delighted to begin my first novel by Nora Roberts. thinking what a gifted writer she was turning out to be. I was looking forward to getting other novels she wrote when I completed ""Private Scandals"". I quickly became dismayed when, as most authors do today, she began using the Lord's name as a curse word. Over and over. Why do authors only choose to disrespect Christians, and no other group? Every few pages, she wrote, ""Jesus!"", ""Christ!"", ""Jesus Christ"". By the time I got to page 166, I had blotted out 19 blasphemies, and there are 405 pages. Page 166 also finally caused me to put it down when she wrote, ""Jesus H. Christ!"". It was the final blow; the last straw. You never read, ""Buddha!"", ""Confucious!"", or ""Mohammed!"", do you? Why, that would be offensive to readers!!! Christians should begin complaining about this rampant disrespect for our religion."
3,Mystery Revealed,"While the mystery of this story is in itself not difficult to unravel, it still has Robert's ever guiding grasp on the reader. I was able to follow and predict the plot which is usually boring and disappointing but in this case I was still hooked by the entertaining dialogue that she does so well. And as usual the character development was insightful and creative. Overall a good read with little suspense."
1,Dryer Beware,"This hairdryer also sucked my hair in, requiring a massive trim job to fix the hairs it didn't completely rip out of my skull. This is the worst hairdryer I've ever owned (for only 2 months!) and wouldn't recommend it to my most hated enemy. I personally would rather have the noisiest hairdryer on the planet than this one, which is dangerous and definitely does not ""care"" for hair."
5,I've lost sleep over this book,"Can this book be true? Is it a hoax like the HITLER DIARIES? Is it a hoax like Clifford Irvings "" Unauthorized Biography of Howard Hughes""? For all our sakes it better damn well be. What scares me is that I cannot refute a page of it. It is either the most shocking story to come out of WWII or the best fairy tale ever written. No wonder the first edition is out of print. If this book is true then Mr Douglas should get a Pulitzer, if a hoax , he should be applauded for writing the best hoax of the 20th century. However in my heart I fear every word is true. It will take a smarter person than me to refute the allegations in this book."
2,"Some good parts, but....","Greil Marcus has a few very interesting things to say, but his writing style is unrelievedly GRANDIOSE. I love most of Dylan's work and read this book because of that, but found myself skipping over large chunks of it. It's like eating nothing but marzipan, all day every day!"
2,a struggle,"""The Basement Tapes"" is one of my favorite albums of all time. I love Dylan and the Band --- at least most of their stuff --- and also am interested in history. But this book bored me to tears. I found it a real struggle to even stay awake and finish it. Perhaps my intellectual ability lacks the capacity to absorb what Marcus is trying to convey within these pages. But his whole premise of linking the themes on this album to a period of American history strikes me as both far-fetched and futile. I love some of the other negative reviews here and would have to agree with those comments. Gibberish? Well, it's closer to gobbleygook. Unless you are familiar with the turgid writing style of Mr. Marcus --- and happen to be impressed by it --- beware of this sleep-enducing tome."
2,Pompous,"Well. I looked forward to this book immensely. And though, as a Brit, I don't have a personal Yankee context, I was pre-disposed to be favourable. However....I found this book both pompous and, even worse, pretentious. The links were tenuous, the prose was a thesaurus exercise without meaning. But with too much ambition. I bought the Basement Tapes when they first came out. Hell, I bought them on vinyl just off Carnaby Street, as the Little White Wonder. Some time ago, when Pat Garret and Billy The Kid was showing. Marcus attempts to place the sessions on a large social mural - spanning over a century. I don't think, in fact, I'm sure, that Bob and the Band were thinking that way.Just a thought."
1,Turgid Flapdoodle,"Too darn high on his own fumes, a once intelligent writer turns an arrogant essay of sorts into an insulting something or other that smells like hubris gone stale."
2,Disappointing,"I hate to be a contrarian, but this album isn't very good and doesn't come up to the standards of her previous album of her dad's songs. With the very notable exception of ""When October Goes,"" the Manilow penned melodies simply aren't memorable. The arrangements, even on classic tunes like ""Skylark"" tend to be sleepy and in the case of ""On the Atcheson, Topeka, and the Sante Fe,"" almost unlistenable.The one gem on this album is ""When October Goes,"" which earns it an extra star. This song deserves to be a standard, with a terrific melody and a wistful Mercer lyric which includes two of his standard themes - that of a yearning for a more innocent past and his matching of the passing of the calendar with aging and sadness.Save your money and buy Ella Fitzgerald's Johnny Mercer songbook album instead."
3,Passable,"This is a fairly good album, if not compared with an album by Nancy Wilson that contain most of the same songs ""With My Lover Beside Me"", the emotive quality barely makes the grade."
4,Very Informative,"I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to get a Neo. As the book depicts, they are not the dog for everyone. Please re-consider if you are not sure. This book will explain the breed in full detail."
3,durable as heck,"If your dog has torn up everything you have ever given him, give it a go with this. Mugsy's graveyard holds the mangled remains of many a dog toybut this item still lives. Not his favorite toy but one he has yet to destroy."
4,A nice collection engangingly played,"I initially bought this because I wanted the original piano version of Claire de Lune and it was reasonably priced. The entire disk is a treat and is one that I pull out more often than I ever thought I would. The playing is rhythmically engaging - soft when needed and aggressive as appropriate. The sound is not a clinically detailed sound but is one that you might truly hear a few rows back in a concert. Overall, just a wonderful experience and well worth the money!!"
1,The worst film I have ever seen!,"Preacher Boone travels to New York to clean up the street gangs in the this well meaning but utterly risible film that was actually based on a true story. Everything about it is dreadful, the acting, the dialogue, the production quality, the editing, the lot. It makes some of Ed Wood's works look like all time classics! A big hit for Christians, maybe, but for non-believers all it provides is a huge laugh, especially the cringeworthy ending, with a still shot of Boone with the words singing ""God, loves you, God loves you. He loves Nicky too""."
4,The Cross and the Switchblade,"though the story is from the late 50's, still a wonderful evident of God's miracolous power to forgive and transform lives that could have ended at young age. Except a few sound mishops at end, the used movie I bought has good quality. Strongly recommended movie both for young and older."
1,? no voice(s),I was looking for the soulful side of shiela E...thinking she would be singing...I found out wrong
3,with many errors,"This book is the classic usually used for Genetics and Molecular biology. It provide basic concept of nearly every aspects. However, there are two drawbacks:1. The objects in the pictures is not carefully arranged. Sometimes it may be confusing.2. The order of chapters is strange, so you had better read in another order.In my opinion, the order is Part1, Part4, Chapter 18-22, Part3, Part2, Part6.By the way, there are many small errors. For example, in figure 29.28 ""Hg"" should be ""Hh"" which stand for Hedgehog.In page 592, the experiment data in figure 19.38 disappear.In all, though it is not the best, but still have the reason to exist at the market"
5,Pagan Children will love this book!,"I bought this for my 7 year old grandaughter. There are so FEW books out there for children and grandchildren of pagans, that I thought I'd give it a try. What a wonderful book! Not only are there recipes, games, and magic, but this book has a wonderful approach to living with our earth. Buy it...you will not be disappointed!"
3,its ok,"it is fun to make the activities but when it got to the potions and spells it was pretty obvios they knew they wouldnt work.like the one to bring a friend back,u make strawberry cookies for ur friend and say a spell.but at the end it spys to talk to them and tell them ur problem.so basically make something nice for them then tell them whats bothering u.so i dont recomend it for children who can tell the difference,like myself."
2,Never received,"I was not able to be at home when UPS delivered the book. So I figured it would go to the Post Office where I could pick it up. Well, it ended up being sent back to Amazon and I was supposed to get a refund yet that never happened."
5,Don't Forget to Get Your Kid This Book.,"This is such a sweet, funny way for kids to wrestle with the horror of their parents GOING OUT. BY THEMSELVES. (""Wait, I'm NOT the center of the universe?"") My boys love it, and regularly shout at me when I'm going out, ""Don't forget to come back!"""
4,Don't Forget to Come Back,This was a witty book describing the fears of children when the babysitter is coming. I found it a pleasure to read. The book uses a language the children are comfortable and familar with. It describes how date night for the parents can be just a fun for the kids. This is a must read in the classroom or at home.
5,And he isnt even in bookstores...,"Its a sad commentary that Jeffrey Fords work is not in major bookstores. I know because I've looked. I realize they only keep newer titles, unless a particular writer or work has had much success. But still.Reading Exo-skeleto town in FWA (the first one I read), I thought, Wow. This is probably the best story in this book. Because its so good that a writer cant possibly keep up this level of quality. And usually there are maybe two or three gems in a short story collections; the rest is garbage.Then I read Fantasy writers assistant. And was proven wrong. Not only is FWA better than exo town, but each subsequent story I read gets better and better. I can say besides maybe the work of Chuck Beaumont, and a Joe Lansdale, I've never read a guy who packs this much quality into each and every short story.Cheers Jeff..."
3,Fits like a glove,"No issues yet!Instructions were easy to follow. I wold just hope that here was more QC done on theses things. Then again, that's why they're cheap!"
5,In their words - the right to love and be loved.,"As an educator working with special needs students ranging in age from five to sixteen, I found this book to be very insightful. The reality of relationships and sexuality can be a challenging topic for people who support persons with disabilities. The author's decision to use each person's words to describe their relationship as part of a couple is a powerful support of the need for self-efficacy, regardless of cognitive ability. The common thread that runs throughout the interviews is each person's belief that they have the right to make decisions about who will share their life. For all people who impact the lives of persons with disabilities, this book is an eloquent reminder that we all share the same dream and we all have the right to pursue our dreams."
3,"Looks great, but overpriced!","I love the look of this diaper caddy. It's really cute and the colors are really beautiful. I don't really move it back and forth from room to room, so it pretty much stays on top of the changing table. I can fit about 30 diapers in the box and I use the additional compartments for diaper rash, q-tips, cotton pads, etc.I would probably purchase it again for the look since there aren't many diaper caddies that look this cute. I'm hoping I can use it for something else later on! The only drawback is the price, which I found to be too much for just a diaper caddy but it's pretty solid so it should last a long time."
4,Bad recording mars otherwise worthwhile set of songs,"Like old vinyl with too much music on it, you have to turn this one up. It must have been recorded with a boom box. But that aside, the performances are wonderful, and the beautiful guitar playing of Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd is freer and more experimental than the great but contained guitar playing on ""Marquee Moon."" The obvious stand outs are ""Little Johnny Jewel"" and ""Marquee Moon,"" which both clock in at 15 minutes, and not a single one wasted. Their covers of ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"" and ""Satisfaction"" are as good as the originals."
3,Worthwhile for fans,"I've always heard that Television was an amazing live act that did a lot of improvisation. It's nice to be able to hear a bit of what they sounded like live since I've only heard the studio albums and never saw them. This CD gives a bit of an impression of what they must have been like live. Sometimes they seem spot on, sometimes seem to be struggling to meet the (enthusiastic) audience's expectations. Robert Christgau, in his Record Guide, expressed surprise and joy that a great live band managed to make good studio albums, and actually surpass their live act. For people who only know the studio albums, the live stuff is a bit of a comedown, but still worth hearing for fans. The sound quality is audible and fairly clean, but sounds like it was recorded with one mike in the middle of the stage."
4,Not too bad considering...,"This cold War film really wasn't all that unbelievable for the time it was produced and distributed, when one takes into consideration the abysmal behavior of Soviet troops in eastern Europe under Stalins' arrogantly paranoid leadership from the mid-1940's until his demise in 1953.The tragic historical record of the liberating/conquering Red Army speaks for itself, and this film accuratly portrayed how they would've behaved had they actually invaded the United States in 1952."
3,A step down,"After the brutal, dirty assault of Shadow Hearts, this CD really disappointed me. Although they maintain most of their heaviness, I can't help but feel that with this CD Caliban were really trying to get into the mainstream. I would say now that this CD is really rather emo. Superior emo, granted, but emo none the less.Still, it was catchy enough, and I didn't get bored, so it's worth a listen if you prefer the less heavy, but more melodic bands."
5,Great Core Workout to do Everyday!,"I bought this DVD about a month ago, with the thought that I should be able to find 8 minutes in each day to work on my core strength. I now do the Abs workout every morning first thing. Do I now have a six-pack? Nope - like everyone else I have a little fat around the middle. But what I do have is a noticeably stronger core - not only the abs, but all the supporting muscles on the side and back. The workout offers three levels, and I was able to get to the advanced level fairly quickly. After only a month, I can now feel rock solid muscles around my entire mid-section. And this has translated into better posture, a stronger back, a flatter stomach, and a reduced chance of injury during my other activities. Again - I am only doing the abs section, but I can imagine doing this every morning for the rest of my life. Highly recommended!"
4,Great Simple Workout Video,"I bought this for my wife, and she absolutely loves it. We are going to buy more copies for family members. The exercises are short and to the point and anyone can do them. All around simple and effective. Very glad we bought this video."
2,Misleading...,"I bought this thinking it was a DVD version of a VHS tape that I had and loved (before my tape player ate it). It's by the same outfit, and advertizes it's from the creators of ""the original."" Well, it may be from the creators..... but it's a TOTALLY different workout. :08 Minute Abs used to require no pressure or involvement of knees (mine are bad) and this new routine assumes that you have the knees of a 16-year-old. Impossible to use. I went back on line and found another copy of my original VHS tape; don't know if I'll be able to use this DVD at all."
3,A Little Wide Of The Mark,"Like almost every film that Steve Martin has written and appeared in, The Three Amigos is a copy of something else. We assume that the title was borrowed from Walt Disney's ""Three Caballeros"" and their outfits seem to have come from some old Cisco Kid movie. In a watered down version of ""The Magnificent Seven"", three silent movie western heroes are hired to chase marauding Mexican bandits out of a small village. It all goes on a little too long but there are some funny moments.A song sung around the campfire with horses and hoot owls joining in is quite amusing as is the song and dance routine performed by Steve and Martin Short in a saloon filled with tough-looking hombres. This film needed to move along a little faster and definitely needed some better gags. Still, Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short work well together in a film which could have been much funnier."
4,Overtly stupid and highly entertaining!,"I have to admit, I didn't give this movie the time of day in it's initial release. But, with repeated showings on TV I suddenly discovered that this is one funny movie! The only down side to this DVD version is that there really aren't any good extras. The picture and sound quality are good, but the ""goodies"" leave much to be desired (in Chevy's bio it claims he starred in ""Fletch 3""). I would love to see a special edition version with commentary from the cast & crew. Until then, this will just have to do."
2,Not all I thought it would be.,"I purchased Three Amigos because I enjoyed Martin Short so much in Pure Luck, and because some friends recommended it. The movie felt kinda awkward and never really seemed to come together. It had funny moments, but I don't plan to watch it again. Luckily, it was inexpensive."
5,"Gaw Gaw! WHistle Whistle. Gaw Gaw! ""Hey Guys! ""","Well, silver screen to a dynamic team. One of the funniest movies ever made with action. Like when dusty Bottoms had only takes about a fourth of water in his cantine, and throws the rest out. He also takes out lip balm, nedelander was full of sand. well, if you like western's and think comedy rules, buy the Three Amigos."
4,A plethora of yucks,"It helps to have a SENSE of humor to enjoy this film. You know, the quality that seperates the smart file-clerk from the dumb CEO. If your sense of humor is not well-developed you may find this film boring, or confusing. Don't fret, there's hope! Rent some Marx Bros. or Pink Panther! Prime the pump if you're a stick-in-the-mud. If you enjoy inspired absurdity, then this film is the ticket. The leads are great, but it's the supporting cast that really make this film work. The plot is thin, but that's OK. The ""bar scene"" and the interplay between evil ""El Guapo"" and his sidekick, the long-suffering ""Jefe"" are worth the price of the DVD."
4,Funny western has aged well,"We're very pleased with the new Blu-Ray release of Three Amigos. The video and audio quality is miles beyond the old DVD and the included extras are great. A fine opportunity to see comedians early in-career as well. I'm glad that the original long opening wasn't used in the theatrical cut, but it was cool to see anyway."
3,This is an overrated window,All this book proved to be was a sick and twisted window into a true psychopaths mind. I am disgusted with the ideas and mindset presented here.
4,"Fast, precise, good grip.","I've been using this mouse for a month now. The first thing I noticed is how precise it is. The buttons that control speed are also convenient, you can switch speeds at any moment.The surface is very nice to the touch, has good grip.It works very well for gaming.There are couple things I don't like about it however. First and so far the most annoying is the middle button (the wheel) click, it's too hard to press it and I use it all the time; the main buttons' click could be a little finer too. Second, the mouse is kind of big so it became uncomfortable to use with my Belkin mouse pad with wrist pad, i.e. the mouse is too large for finger grip (if your wrist is resting on the pad) yet it's not designed entirely to be palm gripped.I have not noticed any laser mouse specific troubles yet, e.g. sensitivity to pet hair, dust."
1,$160.00 haha pathetic.,"i bought this mouse new when it first came out.for $69.99 now someone wants $160.00 give a break. talk about highway robbery.i wouldn't pay that price with your money. non the less my money.great mouse but not for that price, id look else where, IE:new egg, tiger direct, compusa, directron, ebay, ect. anything other than here.i love amazon and buy alot form here but i would not pay this its pathetic!!!!!"
5,BEST mouse i have ever used,"This is the mouse of the hour. being a hardcore PC gamer, a good mouse is very important. and the logitech G5 is really up for the task, with customizable weights, on the fly sensitivity changing (no software required), 5 button, 2 axis wheel, and great touch and feel makes this the ultimate gaming mouse out there. although the price tag is a little to high, but its nothing you will regret with playing a call of duty 4 online."
5,Much better than the G9,I recently upgraded my failing MX510 for the G9. I had major issues with the shape and it causing pain in my wrists. I returned it to get the G5 and am very satisfied.
4,Too smooth,"This is a good mouth considering its quality, however, the 2000dpi option makes the mouth fly!! Hardly control it while using 2000dpi, seems useless to me actually. But overall, this is a nice mouth."
1,Delivery,"So I waited for the mouse for over a week, past the usual shipping date, and I finally received it. I opened it, plugged the mouse into my computer and started installing its driver. Unfortunately, on the day I received my Logitech G5, it was D.o.A., defective on arrival."
1,Price - What the Hell?,WHY ON EARTH is this mouse $179.99? Similar laser mouse products go for around $60-$80. This is absolute highway robbery.
4,The trouble with mice,"I'm not a gamer (though I like an occasional game)but I use my mouse 8 to 12 hours a day for the type of work I do, so I wanted a mouse that would be comfortable and responsive. I tried a variety of ergonomic solutions but though they were somewhat comfortable they were usually not overly responsive and I still felt less than happy. Then I decided to try a gaming mouse on the grounds that they should be the most responsive and comfortable of mice. The first unit was defective but the second unit was everything I hoped for but there was still a snag. My work mouse runs three computers from a KVM switch and one of the computers uses the old PS/2 connector and the gamer mouse won't work with the old connections. Since we need this computer for legacy stuff it can't be discarded so I'm still searching for a work mouse - but the mouse is everything I could want on my private computer."
5,Great corded mouse,"Very comfortable in the hand. Great options and well placed buttons. Not using it for gaming so can't comment on that aspect. The Logitech software can be a bit balky and takes a surprisingly long time to install and update, but does the job once set up. Too bad the mouse doesn't come in a left hand version."
1,Dry-grip texture is like sandpaper. Blech!,"If, like me, you are sensitive to textures, find this one on display at a store and give it a try before you buy it. I find the Dry-Grip surface on the sides of the mouse to be excruciating to touch. It's the tactile equivalent of fingernails on a blackboard for me. It's a shame, because otherwise I'm pretty sure this would be the perfect mouse for me."
5,Engaging and Insightful,"Simply stated, this book is an eloquently written account of the joy and horrors experienced by the men and women who serve in EMS. Objective, moving, and holding nothing back, this book holds a special place on my bookshelf as an aspiring Paramedic. Kudos to Mr. Canning and everyone else like him."
2,Not too good,"I searched around for a quite long time before I decide to purchase this model - the performance of this clipper is very poor, I have to switched back to my old kit to cut my son's hair. Very dispointed."
5,Cutting hair and barber's bills,"I wanted to be able to cut my own hair, in a simple crew-cut fashion. That is, a #3 all over. These clippers do that, no problem, so I cannot think of any reason to give them less than 5 stars. For the price of two haircuts, I can keep my hair at the length I want it all the time."
4,Versatile product,"I've owned my Wahl 15 piece trimmer for over 7 years (same model as above) and loved it. The multi-position cutting blade is one of the handier features to use to make close shave cuts on necklines or around ears. I also like the attachments for length. I found that I only use the 1/2"", 1/4"" and the two ear ones for most jobs, so it's not really worth it to me to buy the model with more attachements.My trimmer has been dropped numerous times on the floor and held up wonderfully, so it is a durable product. However, recently my dog caught his leg in the power cord and it fell with great force on to a tiled floor and cracked the case significantly, so for safety's sake, I'll be buying another trimmer soon.I use my trimmer on both my dog and husband (although I make sure to clean it well in between cuts!) and it probably gets used about 12-15 times a year.Very versatile and well worth the money!"
2,Wahl Clippers - not so good,"They have to be lubricated several times during a hair cut. My hair is very short and this is unusual. If you do not go over every area of your head at least 5 times you will have tiny haris sticking out. I spent more on these clippers thinking they would be better. I would have been better buying a cheap pair at Walmart, which I normally do."
3,Basic material,This book will give you a basic understanding of the bass guitar. You will want a more advanced book quickly
5,another great video from fred levine,"This video has my two-year-old twin boys enthralled. Great footage of tools in use and their all-time favorite sequence featuring logging machines. There is some overlap with road construction ahead, but they don't mind a bit. Its all exciting stuff. I'm very picky about what I will let my kids watch. This is educational, exciting and, after watching it myself a hundred times, has nothing that might annoy adults. Two thumbs up."
1,Did not live up to title--disappointing,"This video was not was I was looking for. Over half of its 30-minute running time was devoted to how concrete and lumber are made, including a very long, boring segment on how rock is dynamited to form gravel. This segment was copied almost directly from another video from the same producer, called ""Road Construction Ahead.""Only about 10 minutes of this video were actually devoted to showing how a house is built. This should have been the main emphasis.I was very disappointed with this video, and returned it for a refund."
1,Not what I thought it was,This was not the game I was expecting. Nothing like the actual ps3 game. This is Very disappointing and upsetting.
5,Re-listening...,Re-listening I once more discovered what a jewel this recording is. Callas is the non plus ultra in all things opera. Just sublime! BRAVA!
2,Good resource but horribly overpriced,"This is a useful resource, but it is a $73 pamphlet. This should cost < $15 for the quality of the book and paper. It is not hardbound and the paper is about a step up from newsprint. For the price charged, it should have been a hardback on high-quality, acid-free paper, but it's nowhere close. If you can get a deal on a used version, do it."
2,Good product when it transmits.,"This is a good product when it actually works as advertised. It has yet to work more than 25 feet from my smoker; 100 feet is almost laughable. I just had mine 40 feet from the smoker (outside so it didn't go through walls) and it didn't update the temp. I have also seen the remote receive lose the display. In order for it to turn back on you have to go through the syncing process all over again.I hope I got a bad bath because, if not, the wireless feature is pointless."
3,"Works alright, but not user friedly.","Gave this as a Father's Day present. Used this thermometer only once to check the temperature reading on the oven, which it accurately did. This thermometer requires that you turn on both the receiver and base by removing the battery doors to switch to ""on"". Dad declared that to be a dealbreaker and is returning it for the ET-732."
4,Great for BBQ smokers,"I have used this wireless remote to check both the temps of meat and smoking chamber of my BBQ. I was not able to find another remote similar, so it's hard to compare, but I have been happy with it. I heard it goes through batteries easily, but I have put my remote through 5 separate cooks that lasted a minimum of 10 hours each and the batteries were still good. Don't try to go too far with the remote and make sure you don't go behind too many walls, otherwise you may lose the signal. The only draw back I found was on the main unit. In order to turn it on or off, you have to remove the back cover where the batteries are stored. Putting the switch on the outside would have been most beneficial.Overall, I was very satisfied with the RediCheck Remote."
2,probes are the weak link,"The probes should stay out of the kitchen, 'cuz they can't stand the heat. They will change resistance from several ohms causing them to be off 50 degrees to a dead short causing a ""HHH"" reading on the display. The last probe failed the first time used in the first few minuets. The cables need to be shielded from heat better or used in the re-fridge. The temp value does not scroll up and down, just up. The on switch is hidden behind the battery door. Maybe minor inconveniences but should be addressed."
1,No customer support,"The first time I used my unit it worked well for the first six hours. Then it started showing ""HHH"" in the pit probe display. Restarting didn't help.I have called techinical support and did not get an answer. Next I emailed them and have not received a reply in four days.I would call and see if they answer their phones and emai them and see if they return your email before I buy one odf these units.I gave them one star because that was as low as I could go."
4,Nice product,"I like this product. I have one issue...the on/off button is in the battery compartment. Really dumb place. But everything else is really good. No issues with the wireless feature as it works from our patio all the way to the front of the house. The two temp sensor is amazing. If you are using a BGE or Big steel keg, this is a MUST have."
4,Monitor,"This is a nice product and is invaluable for serious smokers.I agree with a previous reviewer about some of the design flaws, particularly with the accessibility of the on/off switch on the transmitter portion and the clumsy mode for changing temperatures. The whole control interface is not terribly user friendly. Be sure and keep the instructions in a safe place because you will need them.It does seem to be extremely accurate, both in monitoring food temperature and the temperature in the cooking unit.So far, the range on the unit has been very good. I have not noticed a problem with range being terribly restricted by walls, etc.All in all, it seems to be a good value. Time will tell."
2,No replay ...,The sinder unit from Maveric stoped sending on the first use. KitchenAid has not answered my E-Mail.... Bill
4,This is a great Thermometer! A must have for the meart smoker!,"I purchased this thermometer October 8, 2007 at the sale price of $40.35, shipped. After receiving the thermometer the first thing I did was test its accuracy by doing the boiling water test. The second the water went into a boil it hit 212 (water boils at 212). My smoker is just outside the back door and I carry the remote thermometer everywhere I go--even in the front yard. I have used it repeatedly and have never had a problem. I am waiting for it to go back on sale to order another for the multiple smoke. This is certainly a must have for the beginner or avid meat smoker. Please hurry up and go back on sale!"
3,It's OK,I have used the ET-73 several times with my propane smoker and it works as advertised. A dual probe thermometer is a necessity when smoking poultry and large cuts of meat and this fits the bill. I have used it 4 or 5 times now without any issues. I can monitor the food and smoker temps from inside the house with the remote. Occasionally it drops the signal but it always comes back momentarily. One minor complaint would be the odd placement of the on-off switch inside the battery compartment of the receiver unit.
2,"Great Product idea,, but....","I used the Maverick ET-73 (4) times and on the 5th use the on/off button on the receiver broke.. The transmitter at the smoker still works but I lost the remote capability / function.. These need to be built with better quality but it's made in China so like everything made in China, it's cheap..."
3,Good for a while,I enjoyed this thermometer for about 10 uses. It was great to sit inside during the heat of the summer or cold of the winter and be able to monitor the smoker temperature and meat temp. After about ten uses the meat portion of the thermometer stopped working and It was only useful to monitor the smoker temperature. I am going to try the next more expensive model with the hopes that it lasts longer.
5,Works great,I have really enjoyed using this set. Now I can sit in the house or do other things to get ready for guests and not worry about the BBQ.
1,Thumbs Down On the Maverick,I tried two different units.The first had maybe 25 feet of range and the signal couldn't penetrate my woodwalls.The second was about the same. The probes turned out to be way off as much as 40 degrees F under temperature over a range of 150 to 300 degree F. I thought I might have gotten a bad one the first time. Nope.I'ts too bad that Maverick has such a crummy Asian supplier.Believe me go buy another brand. Don't consider this one until they can prove it transmits over a 150 feet.Best of Luck
5,glad I bought this one,"This meat and temp thermo is the best thing I have ever bought for slow cooking next to the smoker itself! It's so important to know the temperature on the inside of the smoker, knowing the temp of the meat is a major bonus, you never have to open the lid period. Im glad I bought this one and recommend it over much more expensive models that don't work as good. This may be the most important tool you could buy, believe me get this thing! I've used maybe 10 times and have had no problems with anything other than the range from the wireless device, honestly I didn't buy for the wireless device I like to stay close to the smoker, but I have that one worked out now so no worries there anyway... If you want accurate temps this product won't let you down, if you want to go to the store while your cooking and still know the temp then you need a rocks stoker and ipod touch and aren't reading this anyway!"
2,Probe malfunctions,I have used this Smoker Thermometer for 6 months now and have had multiple probe failures. I have had 3 smoker probes and 2 food probes go bad. Maverick has been very accommodating and has replaced all of them. Which is nice but still doesn't address the frustration. Nothing worse than having both probes stop working when you are in the middle of a long smoke.It seems as though they know they have a problem with the probes but continue to send the same probes out that last for 2 or 3 uses. I will look for another thermometer from someone other than Maverick.
1,Poor quality,"Great idea, poor execution . . . Both tempertaure probes stopped working after two uses, I was careful not to get liquid on them, but they still have malfunctioned, BOTH of them! This was used in a smoking application, so I also know that I didn't surpass temperature limits. I have moved to a different manufacturer, KH"
1,Cheap Product,Loved it for the the first 5 times but then the smoker probe simply stopped working. After some research I see this is a common issue. Now looking for a quality thermometer to replace it. What a waste of money.
2,"Good concept, less than stellar execution","I've owned this for four months, used it at least 20 times and overall I'm disappointed. My probes both burned out within a couple of days of each other after four months of use.Pros:- Great concept, and convenient if you're smoking anything large that may take several hours- Dual smoker and meat probes are handy to have in one unit- Easy to read LCDsCons:- You have to remove the back cover of the sending unit each time you need to turn it off/on- The range is quite poor, especially if your smoker is outside and you want to stay inside. I keep my smoker just outside my garage and I lose signal inside my house unless I keep the receiver on the counter right by my garage entrance, so the range is only about 25 to 30 feet.- The temp probes on my unit seem to be consistently high by 5 to 8 degrees compared to my smoker's digital temp probe and other manual thermometers.- Short lived"
4,Works great after antenna hack,"As many others have said, this is a fantastic thermometer. It has one major downfall and that is the range.It is advertised as 100ft and I have confirmed that to be true, but only when both the transmitter and receiver are outdoors and within line-of-site of each other.When you come indoors, range is drastically reduced. I created this tutorial on how to increase the range of this product so it still works well when you come inside. Use at your own risk![...]"
1,Horrible Setup,"I do a small amount of meat smoking on the side, but wanted a wireless setup for my smoker so that I am not out there checking temps every 10 minutes. Great idea eh? Well, no if you plan on buying this setup!! The base probe has an on/off switch inside of the cover in which you have to screw off to get to the battery. So everytime you want to turn on or off your opening the whole case up. The ""wireless"" works for about 8 feet, not whatever it claims. So I had to be walking by my smoker for it to read, which took the whole point out of it. Also, the base unit would not turn off, so i basically had to remove the battery to just turn the system off. Do not buy. If it looks like a decent price, it is for a reason."
1,Dissapointed,This thermometer is very difficult to use. The directions are very complicated and when you set the temperature to the degree you want it starts at 176 so you have to scroll all the way to the end and back up which is a long way.I would not recommend it at all. I hope the next generation is easier to use.
4,bbq temp remote system,"After a little study of the instructions,the sender and remote worked great. Have used it a few times being careful of the sender cable."
1,Not Reliable,"Seems like it's OK built, but the problem is that it's not configured very well and it's not reliable. Figuring out how to use the unit is confusing and the instructions are very poor. Also, I left a message with the company to call me back. The message on the answering machine came off like it was a machine left on a number that never attended to. Sure enough I never got a call back after 2 weeks of waiting. The unit sometimes transmits the temp. and other times it shows you the old temp. that has not changed for hours, but when you look at the transmitter you see that it's way off. I was not further than 20 feet from the transmitter ever. It just not designed well and the company offers zero customer service."
2,Poor design but works well.,I use this on weekends and have found it very reliable. The design of the on/off switch is terrible. You have to take it apart to find the switch to turn it on or off.2 weeks after I started using it one switch broke right off. The switches are small and poorly designed. I remove the batteries now to shut it off.Like I said before TERRIBLE design but very accurate.
5,a great sesame street video,probably my favorite sesame street video.I loved watching it when i was younger and i still love it now.One of my favorite things about the video is the way they count down the videos like on MTV.It also has some of my favoritsesame street songs on it.It's really to bad its out of print because I broke my copy of it and I wasn't able to fix it.I really suggest this video for people who love sesame street.It's a must have.my favorite video on the tape is wet paint.I can't seem to remember what happens during wet paint music video and i've been trying to find the music video to the wet paint song to download on the internet so if you know where i can download the video or can remind me of what happens during the music video please email me....

3,El Cajon,"The book Fantasic Voyage is a very action packed book. I thought the book was very interesting. The five main characters of the book are General Alan Carter, Colonel Donald Ried, Dr. Peter Lawrence Duval, Dr. Micheals, and Lindsay. They must board an atomic sub and be miniaturized and go into a dying mans arteries. the slytest sound could kill them as they enter the mans ear.they must get to the arteries of the heart to save him. They must reach the blood clotin the guys artery. They must use the piecing ray of a laser to clear up the blood clot. If you want to know if they save the man or they all die in his body you will have to read the book."
5,Biology Class Was Never This Much Fun,"In the perennial debate of which was better, the movie or the book, this book wins hands down. Isaac Asimov took the modest screenplay of an ambitious movie and turned it into a masterful and riveting novel, proving once again why he remains one of the grand masters of science fiction of all time. Although it reads a bit dated now (it was written at the height of the Cold War in the 1960s) nevertheless ""Fantastic Voyage"" is still a gripping story and a veritable roller coaster ride through the human body. ""Fantastic Voyage"" was the ""Inner Space"" of its day. And thanks to Mr. Asimov's medical background, it was a painless and entertaining way to learn some actual anatomy and human biology along the way. This book remains one of my favorites, even decades after I read it the first time. I finally had to buy it in Kindle format because my aging paperback copy has been loved and re-read so many times it is literally disintegrating and falling apart!"
4,TUFFCUFF,"This is a must for a serious baseball pitcher from 13 -21 years old. Is the best step by step stregnth and conditioning manual I have ever seen. Use it, it works. Stregnth equals pitching power and power equals speed.ik201@aol.com"
2,Overpriced,I guess for the price we were expeceting something more than a spiral bond book. It looks like it was prodcued at a copy center and then spiral bond and shipped. Nothing professional about this. Very disappointed in cost versus material as well.
4,"Very Good Condition, Shipped Quickly","Very pleased with transaction. The book's pages were yellowed with age, as to be expected, but the condition was still very good."
1,Returned it,Wow... The guy at company support told me it only works on documents with less than 50 pages. That was after I scoured the web site for info. I sent it back unopened (so the star rating is for the deception on their site).This is a bad company... I use Adobe Professional instead.
3,Career Guide Based on Psychological Obstacles,"The author's premise for not knowing ones career, is that there must be a psychological obstacle. The problem with this is that if one does not have a psychological obstacle and merely does not know what career would best fit, the book does not offer a lot of guidance in this area. However, it can be very helpful if you find that your career decision difficulty is based on a psychological obstacle."
5,ldealistic yet Realistic,"A lil flaky in terms of how life can unfold, but she is right, there are too many hours of your life not to pursue happiness first."
2,For failures only,"This book will likely help you if you really have never accomplished anything in life yet are reasonably capable but tied in knots by psychological, childhood related fears. Otherwise, I think you'd be wise to look for career guidance elsewhere."
1,"If 10 feet is remote, then OK","The thermometer and timer appear to work fine, but the range of the transmitter limits the received to about 10 feet. That makes the remote feature almost useless. First, I tried the batteries that come with the device; then I changed them for fresh new cells, suspecting the batteries were weak, but that didn't improve the transmission range. I gave the unit one star as a remote monitor. It would deserve four or five stars if it were really useable as a remote monitor."
3,"ok, but not great","The movie follows a fighter pilot sent to a elite training mission, however does not go into the more educational role as most IMAX movies do. It mainly tells a short story with no real details or plot line."
2,"Very weak narrative, but some nice takes",The narrative is very weak up to the point of being embarrassed for those who wrote it.. But--the takes are nice and it gives a pretty comprehensive overview of what the exercise is all about.
4,What a rush!,"A well-done transfer from the Imax format into HD. The film follows a U.S. fighter pilot on his first deployment to Red Flag. My son-in-law has bent my ear many times with Red Flag stories, so it was especially fun to see what he has been talking about.Great flight scenes that make you feel light in the stomach and nifty computer graphics that show how 3-d air combat is supervised by range officers."
1,"Great Topic, Horrible Delivery","I was very excited to see this movie, I even called our local IMAX when it came out to see if they were going to show it. I should have known when they told me, no, that it wasn't going to be good.Dr Hog says it all and he is spot on. But I disagree that they had to do it that way.Go find the Movie ""Speed and Angels"". A fantastic look at what it took to fly the F14 Tomcat.Dr. Hog is right, making the every day, hum drum life of flying jet fighters exciting for the general public takes a lot of talent that this movie couldn't deliver.Great idea, horrible delivery."
3,Not As Good As The Outcast/Heroine Was A Shrew,"I didn't enjoy this story nearly as much as the The Outcast. It lacked the poignancy of the author's first novel in the series. It also had a much weaker plot. One of my problems with the book is the non-existent journey to love for the main characters. Dodge simply loves Starla for no apparent reason. I could never buy it since Starla was a total shrew to Dodge for much of the book. I had a lot of problems with Dodge also. He was so boring compared to Starla's brother. Overall, the book was an enjoyable read, but not a keeper."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Thoroughly overrated, Runaway Train does not deliver as an action picture (the much-hyped scene at a bridge basically consists of some wobbling ties), a character piece (John Voight is exceptionally over the top and annoying) or a well-plotted movie (the characters *actually* escape from prison in a laundry cart, no one figures out until the end that they can simply UNCOUPLE THE RAILROAD CAR) or in any real capacity."
1,Non-DVD,Can't view it when it wasn't designed to play in the United States on a DVD/BluRay player. Thanks guys. You just made my life more freaking messed up then it already was.
3,Great movie,My grandma made me watch this movie when i was younger so when i saw i could get a good deal on it i got it right away and it just brought back memories.However the dvd was scratched when i got it due to the fact that the box was broken to the dvd was flying around . i had to get a new case but the movie played fine.
2,Alternatives Available,"The price tag is way too high for this, especially given the fact that about 90% of the people looking to purchase this product don't need the features allowed.Try googling ""PDFCreator open source,"" and consider the results before investing in this overpriced software."
1,Not what I expected,"I choose One star, as this is a VERY cheap made knife. I ended up giving it to my nieghbor who needed an extra gift for someone.I would have been embarrassed to give this as a gift."
4,Great fun!,"Nigel Hawthorne's adapation of the classic Garrick-Colman play is a delight. Wonderful ensemble acting and period flair--including beautiful shots of eighteenth-century landscape that bring Pope's poem ""On the Use of Riches"" to mind. And there are wonderful touches such as the turnspit dog in the kitchen juxtaposed with Mrs. Heidelberg's lapdog--there's the century summed up for you!"
5,Digital Photography visual Guide,The volume's strong point is its voluminous visual to illustrate every phase of digital photography from equipment to printing paper. It also bridges the gap from optical to digital photography. Technical in presentation ... for the experienced phohtographer ...
5,the Mexican Castle in the Carpathians,"Carlos Fuentes should read Jules Vernes' The Castle in the Carpathians and then, he recalled it when he wrote one of his masterpieces, Aura... Verne wrote about fear to love and death with his positivist point of view; Fuentes wrote about the same fear but his deep sense of mexican surrealismo..."
4,A very Faulkner-like story,"Wow! That was my reaction after I read the story for a class in college. Then, After only a month or so, we had to read ""A Rose for Emily"", by William Faulkner. Both stories are very similar in their central idea. My favorite of the two? Carlos Fuentes wins because he mastered the gothicism and the magical realism, and ultimately created a delightful blend. Wonderful story for a rainy day. Maybe if we look outside we will see a garden with burning felines...maybe not."
3,Pounding Out the First,"With his first extended work in four movements for multiple electric guitars (and other instruments), Branca reaffirms what Virgil Thompson once said about American music: to be an American composer, all you have to be is born in America. While it remains debatable whether the work call truly be called a symphony, what is certain is that the music is powerful, the energy is relentless, and the ideas resonate long after the last movement ends. As a composer, Branca may not be Bruckner, but the birth pangs are fun to hear in this his first symphony."
2,Not so great,Getting at your ear hair and nose hair with a flat blade is an excercise in frustration.I thought this had a round rotor due to the cap but it didnt.
4,Tiken Jah takes on the West and Africa,The lyrics to Plus rien ne m'etonne are some of my favorite of all time. His French is very understandable for an American.
5,Nice Cookie Cutters,Very nice cookie cutters. They worked great and were made well. They are inexpensive in comparsion to purchasing them individually. Fast delivery. Thanks.
3,More expensive than expected,I Found the same set at Meijers for $6 less - regular priced. My fault for not checking there first.
4,Great Book,"We got This Train out of the library for our 2 year old son, and are now buying it from Amazon.com, because he refuses to give up the book to the library! After having it read to him for one day, he picked up on the short descriptions under each vivid picture and was ""reading"" it back to me. It has become his favorite bedtime story book."
3,Nice quality but heavier than expected,"The product is beautiful and I love the pink interior. But it was heavier than I had anticipated so when I add my laptop, it's gets heavy very quickly."
2,Wrong level listed,I am not pleased with this book listing as I was wanting to only purchase pre-level 1 and this is a level 1--makes a difference when a child is just beginning to read a few words.
2,"Fantastic film, horrible DVD!","Once Upon A Time In China is one of the most important landmarks in HK film history with stunning fight sequences, great performances from all the cast and a strong controversial plot altogether. Sadly the American Region 1 DVD fail to do justice to the film. Picture is muddy and sound is mono. Even the english dubbed version suffers from near total darkness. Sound is only mono and not a very good one at that. It's even worse than the Region Zero available in the Asian market.I recommend the UK Region 2 instead. It is definitely ten times clearer and has a full-length commentary by director Tsui Hark and also interviews. Avoid this DVD at all cost!"
2,This movie had a really weak plot,"The plot to the story was confusing and the movie dragged on for a long time. Yuen Biao's character was dumb. The fight scenes were so so.The final fight with the big boss was way too long. It was over kill, that scene was either over edited or way under-edited. The movie gave me bad memories, i kept having flash backs about the part where Fei Hong's 13 aunt was about to be rapped. The only good OUATIC was the third one with the fu dog and dragon dance."
3,Comfort YES Durable NO,"This pad provides some of the best comfort I have ever had in the outdoors. For comfort, definately 5 stars. However, after four uses, it began losing air and the comfort was gone. Durability, only 1 star.It was still under warranty but the manufacturer was unreachable and it was beyond the 30 days that Amazon supports. Fortunately after some discontent on my part, Amazon stepped up and sent me a new one. I have not used it yet, but hoping to have better luck with this one."
1,"Pad leaks, don't buy","I bought 2 of these for my wife and me and now they both leak. We might have gotten 2-3 leak free uses out of them. I determined that they leak around several of the pleats. I was unable to patch due to the location and shear number. I rubbed rtv silicon on all the round pleats with no luck. It still leaks down within an hour or 2. The other one may last half the night. Now neither of them is worth more than a 1"" piece of foam."
4,Coolaroo Large Pet Bed,"Overall the bed is great, it is pretty easy to assemble/disassemble with 4 screws. However, the reason I give it 4 stars is because of 2 reasons: 1) my dog (a 6 month Labrador puppy) was able to get at the edge of the material and chew a corner apart although the bed is still able to hold her weight and still works and 2) the frame may bend a bit and warp a bit at the point where the screws go in because the material is so tight the bed sort of twists until weight is put on it to level the bed down on all 4 legs. We brought our bed with us camping, and I sprayed the bed down with a hose to clean it and it dried in the sun within minutes. Overall I recommend this bed, as my problems may have been just with my bed and my dog."
4,Great Dog Bed!,"Purchased the large Coolaroo dog bed for my 12 year old Golden Retriever based on reviews I read on Amazon. We have gone through many expensive beds, but my dog loves this one the most by far! She suffers from arthritis in her hips and it really seems to help take the pressure off her joints. The Coolaroo bed is so easy to clean, just sweep the dog hair off or give it a quick spray with the hose. Wish I had found this bed before I wasted so much money on other ones!"
5,Great for summer!,"Great bed for summer! The material is very sturdy to support my 90+ lbs Golden Retriever, and as he uses it, it stretches down a bit to make it even more comfortable! Easy to take care of by just spraying it with water from the hose! In winter, we make it warm by adding a regular comforter that we don't use anymore. Awesome price too!"
3,Just OK,I really like the concept but don't feel the construction quality is up to par. I own one for indoor use and it is much sturdier. I have had the other one for about 5 years now and it's in great shape. I forget the manufacturer but it's by far a better quality. I thought that since my dogs were used to this same concept for their indoor bed they would just take to this outdoor one. Not the case. My dogs don't like the fact that they just sink into it and it's wobbly. They are a bit skittish. They will lay in it if I call them over to it but quickly feel unstable and jump off. Wouldn't have minded paying a bit more for better construction. Still hoping the dogs will adapt to this bed a bit more. Just giving it a little longer.
4,My dog loves it!,"Lately, my dog has been wanting to sleep in my bed, so I had to find a solution (an 80 lb pit bull takes up too much room). I ordered this and read the reviews about it being hard to put together. That is true, it is very difficult to put together. Leaving the screws loose helps, but its still no piece of cake. Once i got it set up, I put my dogs bed on top of it. Once he was over being scared of hit, he jumped on, and has been passed out for hours already. It's more than big enough for him! Great buy!"
2,Did not last,"Mickey loved this bed. But the reason for the low review is that the legs got ""tweaked"" and we could never get it to sit on all four legs once that happened. It's hard to describe but it ended up unstable so our dog stopped using it. It was like a wonky table that shifts every time you put weight on it."
3,Disappointed,We purchased this to keep the dogs off the cold wet ground when they dont want to be in their houses. A place to stretch out in the sun. Put it together right a way. The dogs loved it. Unfortunately the next morning the side seam had already come unraveled. Replacement covers are not inexpensive. Dont know that I would trust the replacement not to do the same thing as the orignal.
3,Good,The beds are good but the screws keep getting loose. My husband is constantly tightening them and my dogs are not heavier then 25lbs. but they love their beds.
5,My dog loves it!,The assembly was simple until that final bolt. My dog sunbathes on it and has brought most of her toys to it. Great for indoor and outdoor use ...it has kept up with nasty weather and actually stays clean.
4,good,the procuct is good but the dog doesn't use itwe are speaking to a trainer about how to get her to used the bed not the grass
1,"IMPOSSIBLE to put together, zero stars if I could","Theoretically, this bed should go together like a camping cot. The one I received, 2 of the bolts will not fit into the threads of the side frame supports. I tried for 2 hours, patiently trying to get the bolts in, by hand so as not to damage them, to no avail. I tried each individual bolt into each hole methodically over and over and over and regardless what I did only two bolts will fit! 2 hours of trying ! I'm going to throw this p.o.s. in the recycle bin."
2,You should not need an advanced degree to put this thing together,"While I certainly find this item acceptable once assembled getting it that way took almost an hour! Granted, right in the instruction it makes mention that you will need the assistance on another person to finish putting it together, BUT and this is a big BUT I was alone in taking on this task. I am truly satisfied with my purchase but buyer beware, unless you have help readily available, this is NOT a one person job. You should not need an advanced degree to put this thing together, seriously it only four screws."
1,So ... So,"My dogs do not really care for it. I bought the large dog size but it is more suited for 70# dogs and smaller. The website indicated otherwise. You are better off buying some cheap foam and tying a cheap sheet around it for large dogs (25"" tall 100 plus pounds)."
2,"Not good, so far..","I really wanted a good, cool, comfy indoor/outdoor bed for my med/lg dog who is getting old, has hip problems, and is Nordic - so has lots of fur and needs to keep cool. She always finds the shady spot in the dirt, when we are out in the yard, and I don't want her to get so dirty, but want her to be cool. Sure, I'd love to have the Kuranda or one of the higher end ones, but why spend the money when the Coolaroo was rated so well??Well, I put it together today and it was like a scene from ""I Love Lucy"" - pretty comical! But, not funny. I was so exasperated trying to get that last end to cooperate without twisting. Finally got it together, though not as satisfactorily as I would like, and hoped she would like it. I tried it outdoors, indoors, outdoor shaded area, indoors with her bed on it, and she doesn't care for it at all.Ah well..shucks. Money I don't have to spend, blown.If it changes, and she suddenly loves it, I'll redo my review."
1,STUNG,STUNG!!!! AT THE MOMENT THE BEDS[3]ARE FINE... I ORDERED REPLACEMENT COVERS FROM AMAZON . AFTER SEVERAL WEEKS WAS INFORMED I CAN'T GET THEM. I AM PISSED. THESE BEDS ARE THROW AWAYS. I BOUGHT THEM BBEECCAAUUSSEE COVERS REPLACEMENTS WERE OFFERED. SCREWED.....woody
4,My Dog loves it,"Works well, decently constructed. My 50 pound mutt spends most of her days on it. In the winter, we throw a blanket on the mesh to keep her warm. Requires occasional tightening maintenance."
3,Not durable but comfy,Our dogs love lounging on this bed. They fight over whose turn it is to use it. I just hope it lasts a year. Their claws have poked holes in the fabric some dime sized some quarter sized.
1,Didn't even get one day's use out of product before it failed.,"Product arrived, it was assembled and I placed it in the kennel this morning. 8 hours later, when I returned the ""durable and strong woven fabric"" had ripped away from the frame. It wasn't chewed, it just ripped due to poor quality. It is unrepairable. The size is supposed to accomodate Rottweilers, German Sheperds, Dobermanns, etc. I have an American Bulldog (appx. 100 lbs.) According to the breed class, it should have accomadated him easily. Product fell considerably short of its' expectations; this isn't even good enough to be called junk. Take it from us, find a better product for you pet!-One unhappy bulldog and owner."
4,dog loves it,he sleeps on it whenever he can its either on the porch or in the backyard depending on the season. probably going to get another so i dont have to move it around. i had a problem putting it together cause i rushed thru it. when i slowed down it went together easy
5,Three beds for three shepherds,"I have three German shepherds and all three were vying for the two Coolaroo beds that we have. So I decided to please all the dogs and avoid competition. I bought a third bed from Amazon, and now all three shepherds are happy.Seriously, I found the bed easy to assemble. I think on the whole it took me 15-20 minutes to assemble the bed. One of the bed is outside on the front deck, which gets direct sun in the PM. So far the bed cover has not faded, and we have no additional problems with the bed."
4,One out of two pups love it,"I purchased a medium and a large (for my medium & large dog) so they would have a cool place to lay on my hot deck. Well, the medium probably would have been plenty big enough for the large dog. Only problem is that the large dog does not have an interest in the Coolaroo. The little one however loves them and takes advantage of both of them. When I read some of the reviews I found it interesting that such a simple looking thing could be so difficult to put together. Well, the reviews were right - not an easy task. I can't even give any tips because I just kept wiggling and it somehow eventually fell into place. The large for some reason was a little easier - but maybe that's just because it was the second one I put together?"
2,large dog,"Owned two of these, same problem with both. After several weeks of the dog jumping onto his bed the legs become loose and start to bend. Would be a great bed if the frame was more sturdy."
1,Not strog enough,"This bed did not stand up to an old golden retirverHer foot when through it and got stuck, she had to chew and I had to cut the opening wider to get ther foot out"
2,Leaves a bit to be desired,"We thought this would be a fun Christmas gift for our two miniature pinschers. But, the instructions to put it together don't have words (that's right, only picturs) which left us to our own devices to figure it out. One of the beds is cockeyed because the screw that came with it was bent. The other one is fine."
5,Love it!,"I pretty much only order products on Amazon that have great reviews, and my fellow Amazon friends were dead on with this product as well! Easy to put together, and my dogs LOVE it!"
2,"Yummy Chew ""Toy"" for my dog :(","Not sure why they put a label on the bed, that was the first thing the dog went after. We told him ""no"" and he seemed to leave it alone for the most part for a few weeks. Then one day we walked in the room to find the ""corners"" chewed to pieces. I REALLY wish I could return this. I should have bought the more expensive brand. I wish I hadn't listened to the reviewa of people that claimed dogs couldn't/wouldn't be able to destroy this item. I will try to include a photo of what my 75lb. Lab mix was able to do to this item before we found it and took it away."
5,Greatest pet bed ever,"Bought one of these for each of mine and give them as gifts. Easy to clean, cool, and comfortable."
3,dogs love it,"Dogs love it, and it can hold an 80+ lb dog. They were able to tear the liner, so I hope I can buy a replacement liner for less since the frame is in good shape."
5,Coolaroo Pet Bed,"I was not sure if this item was going to work for the dog of the house.It had such great reviews, so I figured I would give it a chance.I also knew with Amazon if I was not happy I could return it. Amazon is a great company!!!The final decider was the dog. It was her opinion that was most important.This bed is very different from her Pooch Planet Thermacare beds.Dog was reluctant at first, but I would have to say ""DOG"" is very happy with her new bed!Great product and a good price.I will be purchasing another as soon as I get the funds.As you can see, yes she is a spoiled rotten dog, but isn't that the way it is supposed to be?"
5,Super Bed!,"We have had large and medium sized Coolaroos out in our dog run for several years now. They are the perfect solution for your dog's comfort outdoors. The dogs love them and it keeps them off the wet, cold concrete. As long as you don't have a puppy that wants to chew, this product will last a long time out in the elements. Our puppy chewed ours, but what can you expect...he was chewing everything. Now he is out of that phase and is leaving the Coolaroo alone (except to sleep in it!).In response to some previous reviews, you can find replacement covers for these beds at several other online merchants if you just spend a minute or two searching. Admittedly, these beds are a little tough to get the last bolt in place. That is the point though- the mesh fabric initially has to be very tight. As soon as the dog lays in the bed for the first time, the fabric loosens a bit and it is perfect."
3,Beds just okay,"I think the dog beds are just okay. I bought two. One works well, but the other has collapsed a few times. My dogs don't weigh much, so I'm not sure why they aren't working-they're exactly the same. I don't think I'd buy them again, just because I can't be sure it won't happen again."
4,"Flea-free, Pee-free Bed","I will admit that my dog has issues. She pees on her beds. (We're working on it.) In the meantime, here's a dog bed she can't ruin with urine and doesn't harbor fleas. The medium is plenty big enough for my 38 lb shepherd mix and her pug friend to lay on together.I would give the bed 5 stars, but the fabric is so scratchy that my dog wouldn't lay on it at first. I covered it with a towel, which is not ideal, but now she loves it."
5,Easy to put together and very light weight,I wanted my Black Lab off the floor and on a cooler surface other than our carpet. He loves the Coolaroo but I do have to put a light quilt on them (bought one for Family Room and one for Bedroom) because he slips and slides on the original surface. Or maybe he is just too spoiled. Would recommend to anybody -
5,Awesome!,"Great price and dogs LOVE this! I've purchased two over the years and had I not lost the foot on the older one, the replacement fabric I bought would have had me using the old one for many more years. I just purchased a third one for my mom for her dog. He loves it when he's visiting with his cousin at my house so I know he'll enjoy having his own. Great product!"
5,"I like it, but my dog doesn't!","Ok, so I bought this for my 100lb lab/mastiff mix dog ... and she doesn't like it - even though she jumps up on our trampoline and lays on it while in the backyard. Yeah, she's an idiot. I was hoping this would help her stay cool during the hot-humid days here in AR and also help her with her hips (she is starting to sit to displace her body weight) ... but no, she wont have anything to do with this. It's big and takes up more space than her pillow (and I tried to trick her by putting her pillow on top of this ... and she just stood there and whined at it) GgggRRRR! Sturdy and easy to put together - great product for a non-stubborn dog! LOL"
5,Coolaroo Pet Bed,"Excellent, bed even holds me and my 60 lb dog. We use it as her outdoor bed and she loves it, she even goes out from her doggy door during light rainy days to enjoy laying in the rain without getting dirty! She was a bit distrusting of it at first and kept looking & sniffing under it, I suppose wondering if it would hold her up. It took a few days of coaxing but now she uses it daily and seems to really love it. The only drawback-it was a chore to put together, the top webbed bed is a VERY tight fit and it took my husband a few tries to get it to fit on the frame. As I read in another review, make sure the frame is loose before you but the bed on, then tighten with finished. All in all, I think it is an excellent bed for the price."
4,A sturdy dog bed,"I had no trouble assembling this dog bed - it took less than 10 minutes. I ordered the large size which was just right for my retriever mix. I like that is easy to clean but found that throwing an old comforter on top made it more enticing for my older dog to actually use! So, I guess I'll be doing some extra laundry after all! Overall, it's a well made bed that's simple to put together."
5,Easy to assemble,Great instructions and easy to assemble. Seems like it will last as long as our last one did outdoors (~5 years).
4,Dog loves it,"My dog will not be without this ""hammock"" and its great for her, it allows air to flow below her on the hot summer days. The only down side to this product is the bolts/screws on the frame that wont come out after sitting in the weather. You cant change the cover without getting these bolts/screws out. I have a couple of these, the cats love them too. I ordered another one just to change the bolts/screws to a different metal that wont cause problems later."
3,coolaroo pet bed,"large coolaroo was great for my dogs who are 50lbs. +, have to occasionally tighten up the screws . the dogs were a bit leery at first but I throw a blanket on it and they love it. Will be nice to put outside when the weather is a little nicer."
2,Its ok maybe for smaller/non chewing dogs,This bed did not last long within 5 minutes my one great dane was chewing on it. due to the sides being exposed made it very easy to rip. I tried this bed out because i liked the cheap price. I have also bought the XL Kurando bed and love it. it last a long time before the material started to rip and needed to be replace about 1year and half later. I kept that bed outside as well. the material probably gave out after 280lbs constantly had to snuggle on it (my two great danes).
5,"So far, so great!","I've only had these beds for a couple weeks, but so far they're wonderful! We had a big problem with our puppy chewing & tearing apart (AND PEEING ON!) any bed or blanket we'd put down for him. We bought 3 of the Coolaroo beds for our 3 dogs and so far, they love them. It's constructed so there's really no appealing place for your pup to chew, and it's off the ground, so I think the puppy has gotten the idea that he's not supposed to pee on it! The beds are sturdy, well made, and seem comfortable. I only wish I'd bought these sooner!"
5,My Lilac loves it!,"I purchased the (large)Coolaroo pet bed for my Basset Hound. She is up there in age and has a time getting up from a nap while on the floor. With this bed she can spring (okay, move faster) into action. She is skiddish but showed no hesitation the first time she got on the bed. The large size for her is perfect. I definitely recommend this bed for your pet."
3,"great bed, but not for dog chewers!","great bed, but not for dog chewers! the corners should be designed without the gap where my dogs destroyed the bed wioth their teeth!"
1,"This isn't a book, and it isn't pinpoint",This isn't a book. At best it is a high end glossy brochure of the type you normally get for free when you write to a city's tourism commission. It isn't pinpoint. You get a rough scale map of the city with a list of historic sites. Save your cash.
5,Great,"The MZ-R70 is great for those who are just starting out with recording stuff, great for early bands and stuff. If you but this you must buy the PC link recorded from SONY so you can put music files on MDs."
2,Watch out!,"I bought this make of minidisc and found out to work great! However, within 5 months I had discovered that the battery slot had compressed slightly and could no longer hold a AA sized alkaline or rechargeable battery. If it had only compressed at one side then yes, it was dropped. But for the whole battery compartment to do that there must have been a fault. I'm not saying don't buy it, I'm just saying be careful."
4,Congrats to Chris,"I knew chris many years ago in Sugar Land,TX ,then his family moved away.I never knew he was so interested in music. I love the CD, the vocal range and strength are awesome. Keep up the good work and may God Bless Your career, and your Family. Your Brookside Pal, Eber ""GUBER"" Stewart....."
4,"Excellent idea, mostly great, but falls a bit short","This textbook is a wonderful addition to the available textbooks on American government. It provides historical context lacking in most other texts, and does so in a relatively concise and well-presented manner. The American political development (APD) scholarship it's based on works well, certainly much better than the Kernell/Jacobson textbook. Their framework of democracy versus rights, however, does not come off quite so well as they would like, sometimes obscuring the larger point they are trying to make in each chapter. Sometimes the writing, in an attempt to be concise, may be a bit too dense for some students to grasp. Overall this is a great text, with the added bonus of being easy to carry around (shaped like a real book, not a huge textbook)."
1,service,"I don't own this extractor but I do own another product from Mytee(the M-12). I have to say thier is less then average. Cross your fingers nothing goes wrong with your product because their service is crappy. They will not give you a new one if the product is defective out of the box. They have so many excuses why (like they don't have anymore in stock). B.S.!!!! Mine broke twice already within 30 days and I have to drive the damn unit 2 hours away to have it ship back mytee to be repaired. They try to blame me for not know how to use the extractor. That made me even more mad. Wait a week and lose many jobs and money. Mytee, get your act together!!!! By the way, my M-12 cost me almost 3k :("
4,Eastwood's Western Sheriff Arrests All of 1968 New York,"This film has aged extremely well -- a time capsule red state/blue state story of Eastwood's Arizona deputy sheriff -- ""Texas"" to the hard-bitten, seen-it-all New York cops, and his foray to New York City to pick up a fugitive. Eastwood's understated comic performance is spot-on, and New York of 1968 is a bizarre, mysterious melting pot, with hookers, freaks, crazies, druggies, and all manner of miscreants -- all portrayed with a wink and a nod in Don Siegal's steady hand. The scenes at New York's famous Electric Circus, and Eastwood's reaction, are priceless.The Lalo Schifrin soundtrack is especially strong, and Lee J. Cobb's turn as the exasperated police chief adds to the fun. Good supporting roles too by Conrad Bain and Susan Clark. All in all this film is of a piece with New York films of its time, like Frank Sinatra's The Detective, Midnight Cowboy, even The Out-of-Towners. A treat."
3,No Dirty Harry without Coogan,It's a good film by Don Siegel. You can see the outline of Dirty Harry taking shape in Coogan. In this case Eastwood plays a Sheriff sent to extradite a prisoner and finds a new frontier in NYC. They must have also decided that Coogan belongs in the city as a tough cop who knows his ground rather than the country as a top notch law official. There was also a temptation to drift into satire or romance and consume time but in turn so you changed the pace of the story and drifted away it. Eastwood does a decent job but with the exception of Lee J. Cobb the cast's support is inconsistent. Dirty Harry is a better film. It would never have gotten made without Coogan's Bluff. After all how many times can a country boy like Coogan go wandering into the city? Nice introduction to Dirty Harry and the changes that Siegel made. Lots of DVDs stamped and plenty usually available at a cheap price.
5,EASTWOOD WINS AGAIN,I NEVER CEASE TO BE AMAZED AT THE FLEXIBILITY OF EASTWOOD'S ACTING. HE AND CHARLES BRONSON ARE TRULY GREAT ACTORS.
3,"A more brutal ""McCloud,"" a cleaner ""Dirty Harry""","The inspiration for TV's long running ""McCloud,"" this first collaboration of Clint Eastwood and director Don Siegel is a violent and frequently funny variation on the fish out of water theme of Frank Capra's ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town."" Eastwood is an Arizona lawman hunting down an escaped convict in the urban jungles of New York where his unconventional methods clash with the more bureaucratic minded police force he finds in the Big Apple. Not only would ""Coogan's Bluff"" pave the way for Dennis Weaver's less brutal ""McCloud,"" it also seems to have inspired Eastwood and Siegel's ""Dirty Harry"" with its focus on a lawman determined to bring in his man no matter how many civil rights he must ignore to do it."
2,Macho Clint,"This early film of Eastwood's is so bad that it's funny. You'll roar at the cop and Indian stereotypes, the nude babes, Clint's fistfight with six guys, the duelling motorcycles, the bullets in the windshield, Clint in the bathtub, the villain who, no matter how hard he runs, returns to the hero's grasp. And all that glaring, flinty swagger. It's an unintentional parody of every macho film a 15-year-old male could possibly desire. Don't miss it."
2,Not so great,I found this book to be nothing special. There is not magic secret in this book. It is not worth the money.
5,Smartwool socks only for me,"Smartwool socks are warm, soft, and wicking in all the right places. They are the only sock I wear when I can help it. I darn them repeatedly to make them last years. They are really great socks."
2,Image backwards left-to-right,"I got the impression that the Celestron 50AZ, 60AZ, and 70AZ, all had correctly oriented images. The 50AZ is corrected up-down, but is backwards left-to-right. To get a correctly oriented image you need to move up to the 60AZ or 70AZ.I also noticed that when the center of the image was in focus the outer ring was distorted or out of focus, so I really could only look at about half the image area.I have returned this and got a 70AZ instead, and am quite happy with it."
2,Telescope,The was a gift that I got for my son. This telescope was very difficult to set up. Just being able to get it to focus was a daunting task within itself. Once it is put together it is decent for the price.
2,Sceptic!,"I found this telescope in a pawn shop for $20 I bought it honestly just for the sake of a cheap scope. Let me start by saying the tripod makes this telescope junk, I spent 90% of my time trying to adjust, once adjusted I would have a decent picture for a few seconds before having to readjust, then losing my target all together. But on the bright side it does give some pretty great views of the moon. If the tripod was better, I would say this is a pretty decent scope."
1,Broke two years in a row,"We have made press cookies every year for the past 30 years. When our old press quit we purchased this Wilton Cookie Pro, expecting it to work. The press itself worked fine, but the little plastic discs where the dough come out are a poor design. The plastic cannot handle the pressure and breaks. We like the tree shape during the holidays and it broke. The first time we wrote to Wilton and they sent a new disc. That new disc just broke this year. This is not a quality machine, I would look for a different cookie press to purchase."
1,Hazardous Cookie Press,"I have used many cookie presses in the past, but this one was the worst. I followed the instructions exactly and used one of the dough recipes included with the cookie press. Not only did it break during my initial use (after only pressing 2 pans of cookies), the disk inserts shed black plastic into my dough. I threw out all the cookies I had pressed because I did not want my family ingesting strips of plastic."
1,Please don't buy this!,"This cookie press made only 8 cookies before it broke! (I was using regular, non-refridgerated dough.) I had an older Wilton cookie pro and was having troubles with that so decided to buy a new Wilton cookie pro ultra II. What a mistake. Luckily I was able to get my old American Harvest jerky gun and the cookie disks from the Cookie Pro fit. I was able to finish making my cookies.Will never buy another plastic cookie press!"
1,Never again...,"My husband gave me this cookie press as a gift several years ago b/c I had been borrowing his mother's cookie press constantly around November and December.I liked the press lever -- much better than a squeeze handle that would make my hand sore for days. The ratcheting system on my press worked perfectly fine, I loved the storage compartment that holds the extra disks and I also liked that the handle flips over flat along the barrel for easy storage. The piece that holds the cookie cutter disk on, on my model, was metal and was fine.Cleaning was okay.HOWEVER -- the black plastic bands that run along the sides of the dough barrel BROKE on me this year in the midst of baking 14 dozen Christmas cookies. I had to duct tape the thing together in order to finish my dough.Now I'm shopping for an Italian-made model (Mercado) - they're (almost) all metal and should last forever with proper care."
1,Plastic discs deform under pressure and pop out.,I am so disappointed in this tool! I can't get more than a few cookies out of the press because the plastic die discs bend under pressure and pop out of the gun.
4,Very easy to use!,"I have used ""vintage"" cookie presses in the past (my grandmother's)and this was so much eaiser to use. I had no problems with cracking, breaking, tops poping off, or any other of the issues discussed by others. It goes at least twice as fast as the old manual twist one I was using, and the cookies turned out perfect. My husband and I were both very impressed with how easy this was (and he's very picky)."
1,Should have known,"Maybe it was my own fault in believing in a price that was too good to be true for my favorite perfume that was recently discontinued by the brand. However, I was really disappointed that a company, such as this one, is able to claim that they only sell authentic brand perfumes, no knock-offs, when the perfume was not only a knock-off, but then they had the audacity to tell me that it was genuine. Having worn and smelled like this perfume for the past 5 years, there was no doubt in my mind that the off colored, leaking bottle of watered down hairspray was not my signature scent. Seriously disappointing."
5,Awesome Scent,"I am also a Bzz Agent and I received a sample of this product to test out and I LOVE IT!!!! I have a thing for perfume the way some women have a thing for shoes (ha-ha). But I really love the smell of RALPH Hot! It is very sensual and it really does have an ""edible"" smell to it, especially the cinnamon. I have gotten so many compliments on the smell of this perfume; not only from my friends but also from complete strangers! I find that most mornings I reach for the Ralph Hot when I put my perfume on before I go to work. I also have to add that my husband LOVES this smell!"
2,Don't like it,"Bought this for my mom cause she seemed to like it in the store. She ended up just giving it to me. Smelled nice the first time, but after that it just made me sick. Personally, it's just way too...sweet for me. I just can't handle perfumes like that."
4,Expansion,"Well, here is another one from the funkiest men on Blue Note. This album contains the MMW constants such as intricate beats, pumping bass and explosive keyboards, while adding an electronica elemnt to the mix. Whole some purists may grimace, the new music seems natural and unforced. Though this cannot compare to Friday Afternoon and Shackman, it is a great album for die-hard fans and those looking to find something challenging and new."
4,A New Spin on MMW,"It took me a few times to really get into this album, but the love is there. ""The Dropper"" is a lot different in my eyes to previous albums. ""The Dropper"" is a lot more free and open jazz. The songs are really space but still amazing. It seems that Medeski Martin and Wood finally achieve what they are trying to do with this album. The songs aren't very structured, but its on purpose. The keys are a little bit too spaced out sometimes, but the increadible rhythem of the drums and bass keep it all in line. If you liked ""Shackman"" you should love this album, although I like ""Shackman"" a little bit more. MMW showed a new style which you can get hints of in ""Combustication."" If your a MMW fan i suggest adding ""The Dropper to your collection."
5,COMFORT & HOPE,"A very special message for children who are missing their fathers. Beautifully written, this book engages parents/teachers and children in exciting discussions. Certainly opening their minds to much needed comfort and hope."
4,Good backup Kit.,I'm going to preface by saying I have an Electric Winch on my 4Runner so I got this only as a backup.So for the price I can't really complain about the quality of this kit. But you can tell it's not as high quality as a Pro Comp or ARB product. But it does what it needs too. Using it can be a little bit confusing and time consuming. But when you're stuck this will help you get unstuck. So make sure you read and understand the instructions before trying to use it the first time. I would recommend a dry run before using it. There's nothing more frustrating than being stuck and getting confused on how to use something like this in the heat of the moment.The biggest thing to remember is you need an extra strap or chain to use this. IT DOES NOT COME WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED. This is only the basics. Also a good reason to read the instructions first. Because then you'll think you can get unstuck and find out your Dead in the Water.
3,More awkward than its counter parts,"This ""toy"" is very intricately detailed. However, like other figures in this series, its articulation is odd and the figure does not seem suited for child's play. Don't get me wrong, I will still continue to collect these figures, I just wish they were a little less statue-esque and more fun."
4,A little snarky but entertaining,I'm glad I bought the book -- And I especially liked the feel you get for how diverse this country is.
4,Very comfy! But could use a bit more padding,"I'm a beginner when it comes to biking and I was looking for something comfortable that wouldn't break the bank. These shorts are definitely comfy, affordable, and make riding much more enjoyable. One thing that was important to me was that the shorts fit my thighs. I have pretty big thighs, but these shorts are just perfect. The sizing worked out well too, I am currently wearing a size 14 jeans and I got the XL which was perfect. The only reason I didn't give these shorts a 5 is because I think it needs a bit more padding so you can wear it for long rides."
2,Red Fabric is completely see-through!,"The shorts fit reasonably well, but the fabric was sheer to the point of showing everything underneath. Considering most cyclists don't wear anything else underneath their cycle shorts, it was pretty indecent!"
4,internal feng shui,"This book is indeed different than Lillian Too's others because of the spiritual slant, which is very refreshing and interesting. She writes almost from a self-help standpoint - including space clearing, affirmations, and internal states. This book has no glossy gorgeous pictures for which her other titles are famous, but still is very relevant, with all of the practical information. Read it -especially if you were wondering what to do about all those poison arrows!"
2,Kitchen cabinet review,"First of all, I thought these were metal cabinets but they are like particle board. We had to put them together and lining up the doors was a real challenge. The holes that were predrilled were wrong on all four pieces(I bought two cabinets). Now that the cabinets are all together, there is a small gap when you close the doors. They just do not look as nice as that one pictured and they were so hard to put together. There were also marks and chipped edges of each piece, perhaps from being bumped when they were packed or just from shipping. If you're a carpenter, perhaps this would not be such a chore to put together but then if you are a carpenter, you could build your own cabinets, and ones much nicer than these."
4,Baltimore Iconoclast,"Being orginally from the Baltimore Md. area and having lived during those times referred to I really enjoyed the book. At lot of the articles I was familiar with but did not have the in depth knowledge of them. I especially enjoyed the chapters on Mary Avara, who I knew personally,loved and admired, and "" Soft Shoes"" a legend in his own time along with Harry Agro and Tom Ward. Hopefully the author will do another perhaps on the polictical lives of the aforemented with more insight on some of the great political characters of the area and times.Keep up the good work."
4,Hughes on Target!,"Apparently the previous reviewer read only one chapter of the book, the USS Liberty attack by Israel, and he missed that one by a mile. Ward Boston, a major player in the U.S. Navy Court of Inquiry now says the court was a fraud and a sham and the participants were ORDERED to come to the conclusions they did in spite of the fact that Boston and Adm. Kidd both knew the attack was intentional. The Court has been the basis for all of the Israeli claims which called all survivors liars and anti-Semites. The rest of the book was particularly enjoyable, at least for me, an ex-resident of the Baltimore area. I think most residents of Maryland would particularly enjoy the book, I highly recommend it."
1,Not as advertised,This was to replace a kids couch that had the same measurements that this was supposed to. It is was smaller than stated and the cushions are very hard. Very kids and myself were very disappointed.
5,"Love, love, love the sleeper chair.","It is perfect for us! We have twin boys and they take naps in the play room everyday. This is great for them to have their own space to nap and they think they are ""big stuff"" sitting in their own couches! Very heavy duty and durable. We are pleased about out purchase. Way better than the cartoon ones you find at Toys r us or online."
5,Satisfied,I am 100% satisfied with the youth studio chair sleeper. The quality is sturdy and easy for my toddler to open and close.
2,bad acting and weird story line,bad acting and weird story lineover all not a good movie -nothing more to say - not recommended
3,my favorite book in film,"this could have been the superhit with a better script and higher budget. its still a good movie, but not even remotely close to the quality of the book.if u liked this movie read forsyth's books the r extremely well written and researched."
5,sail shade,I replaced the same thing that I had had for years only blue. It is exactly what I want and works wonders in the AZ climate for a cool patio!
5,Shade from a sail?,"I purchased a green Coolaroo Triangle Shade for our deck. Our old one had ripped to pieces after about 6 years in our weather and our relaxation area needs at least SOME relief from the Texas heat. It is a great sail-shaped 16' triangle. There is only one seam, which makes it less likely to be torn when the winds pick up and it seems sturdier than our old one. It comes with two turn buckles that can help the kite reach that tree waaaaay in the back of your yard. You'll LOVE it!"
5,great product,"I would definitely recommend this lovely shade sail to others. It is a piece of artwork in the sky over my patio. It creates a much cooler temp. on hot days and it matches the color of the sky. As always, buying from amazon is great: fast delivery."
4,Shade,It works. Kinda' worried that one of the corners will snap and slingshot the thing into somebody or the windows though.
2,"Material, size, not what I expected","i ordered the coolaroo shade sail thinking this was going to funk-up my backyard and make it look hip and modern. I had seen it in a pic of a friend's backyard and it looked great. I had a hard time determining the right size - on the online info there were no recommendations that i could find regarding suitable sizing of sail to space, and even when i received it it wasn't clear what the size was, so i had to try to pull all 16ft around the backyard to figure out how to hang it. It was too big for my yard in the end and after spending 78 dollars to have it shipped to Canada, i gave it to my parents to use. I was surprised by the fabric - very plastic and synthetic looking, not canvas-y as I expected.Overall, I was disappointed with the whole thing, though it may just have been due to my high expectations as I know there were lots of positive even raving reviews I had read online. good luck w your shade sail![...]"
5,Second Time's Another Charm,We ordered a Coolaroo shade sail several months ago to provide some shade in our new pergola. It was so nice that we just ordered a second one. The product is exactly as advertised and arrived within three business days from date of pruchase.
3,Great music--- waaay too short.,"This soundtrack is taken from Les's TV special ""Music From The 60's"".After a brief description before each song, Les breaks free and lets his orchestra soar. The music is truly outstanding which makes this CD all the more frustrating. It's understandable why the sound quality is only fair being that the audio was taken directly from Les' video copy of the special (the quality is pretty close to what you'll hear on the samples here). What I don't understand is why the short playlist? At the end of the CD, Les says ""It's hard to believe that an hour could go by so quickly."" He ain't kidding--- this CD is only slightly longer than 15 minutes!! If this was an hour long special, why not include every track?However, the music that is included is incredibly well done. If Baxter's pop-type music ever tended to get sappy, none of that is evident on this CD. It also contains perhaps the most solid version of ""Quiet Village"" that I have ever heard."
5,Eddie for the home,"This was a gift for a grown man, so make of that what you will. However, it is a very nice item and came on time in perfect condition. Thank you!"
1,This book should be avoided,"This writer is not interested in properly informing or discussing issues. He says in the book that cancer patients - especially those who have been through the mainsdtream mill - should avoid complementary/alternative treatments simply because they (these alternative treatments) will get in the way of them getting used to the idea of dying. Of all the books I read as someone seeking help for my wife who had cancer, this was and remains one of the most disgusting. Let me declare my interests. I am the author of FIGHTING CANCER - A SURVIVAL GUIDE. In the course of researching my book, this book took the prize for being the least informative."
4,Delaware Vocabulary,"This is a modern reprint of two nineteenth-century vocabularies of the Delaware (Lenape) Indian language (one of them in the unusual Sanhican dialect). It is a very small volume, and there is no phonetic key. An interesting book from a historical linguistics perspective or if you'd like to learn a few words of Delaware, but don't buy it expecting to learn how to speak the language."
5,Passion for Passion,"This is an amazing album! When I first went to my univ. my roomate and I used to blast it every morning! When I was shuffling from home to school... I lost my copy, and just re-purchased it. Songs like Breathe, and Grace Flows Down bring absolute peace and contentment on my most turbulent and upsetting days. The songs The Noise We Make and America get you pumped up for God and inspired. The song We Fall Down, that's sang in Setswana, is absolutely magical and powerful. Salvation is always a song I come back to when I need to feel God's presence. This album is a must have in every Christian's library. It inspires, and makes you feel not alone with the crowd cheering in the background. A must buy!"
5,Close to orthotic grade,I am a physician during the day and an avid basketball player at night. I never use the stock insoles that come with my nike basketball shoes. They just won't cut it. The Sole inserts are the best non-prescription orthotic grade insoles your can buy over the counter (internet). These will mold to your feet after heating them in the oven for a few minutes. The arch supports and padding are fantastic. They add to your balance and help to align your back and prevent foot injuries. I have at least 10 pair of these and I love 'em. They are the best.
2,Support is in the wrong place for me,"I bought these at a local retailer because they had nice stiff arch supports. I have pretty bad Plantar Fascitis and have to have a strong arch support. Unfortunately, the arches in these are too close to the heel for me, even after heating and shaping them per the directions. They pressed into the front part of my heel where I have the most pain from the PF and made it even worse. After wearing these all day, I was barely able to walk because of so much pain. I am sure these will work well for most people, and they seem sturdy and very well made, but they do not work at all for me. I would recommend the spenco orthodics over these.Spenco Arch-Orthotic Full Length Support for Athletic Shoes MenS 6-7/ WomenS 7-8, 1 Pr"
4,there's a band playin' on the radio,"I never understood why the critics hated this so. Sure, the glam posturing is fading, and the remakes of 8 Miles High and the Midnight Hour are campy. But Ferry's unique crooning and songcraft are starting to supplant the fashionista gimmicks of Roxy's 70's art-rock schtick with work that sticks in your head because of its beauty and content, not its image. Oh Yeah is a beautiful, wistful song of lost love that that doesn't sound dated after 24 years. My Only Love is heartache in melody, and Flesh + Blood is still hard to figure out but impossible to resist. Running Wild is a melodic musing on self-destruction, and if you've seen someone else crash-and-burn, it becomes all the more interesting. Overall, this album is better than its precursor Manifesto, and a great prelude to the classic, unforgettable Avalon. Buy it, put on your pyjamaramas,play it in a dark room with a good bottle of wine, and let it wash over you. Then see what's in your Dreamhome..."
5,Their music melts in my ears,I have played the tape I have of this album so much that it plays both sides at the same time if that gives you any idea of how much I like Bryan Ferry's voice.
4,not hard rock,some reviewers don't even include this album in the best of roxy music in part because it's not as high paced and edgy . Unlike their earlier work it's slower and includes some remakes of other peoples tunes but overall i value it for the original music it does have . thats why i picked it up .
3,ok,"these flip flops are pretty comfortable but hurt a little between the toes after a few hours. i like the tread, wish they came in white."
1,A lot of things I don't like...,"First off its Not attractive looking. and it feels stiff and bulky and FLAT. Arch support really? I don't feel it at all.It hurt my foot after I wore it a little in the house (didn't even walk around whole much). Very uncomfortable. Can't believe the price!!! If this is what Reef offers for all other sandals and it's considered one of the best ones they have, I say REEF SUCKS."
5,"Most amazing, durable, comfortable sandals","My Reefs lasted 7 years, traveled to 5 continents, and traversed at least 5,000 miles. After a while they were perfectly molded my feet. I backpacked for 3 months across Europe, walking sometimes 10 miles a day, and wore nothing but my Reefs. Not a single blister and completely comfortable.I also own Havaianas, Chocos, Birkenstocks, and Tevas but haven't been able to wear any of them for multiple days of extensive walking without blisters or with the same comfort level of my Reefs. Recently the tread finally wore down to credit card thin and they needed to be replaced. I was thrilled when I saw that they still sold this model. These are hands down the best sandals out there for comfort and use."
4,Great sandals,"Very comfy for everyday wear!!! Worth the money, will def recommend, wore the everyday on vacation and so glad I did"
4,great flip flops,"Though they run a bit small, these reef flip flops are great. Once broken in, they are incredibly comfortable, and due to the wide fabric bands, they don't give blisters like many other flip flops can. The one down side is that they don't have the best traction, which means you can literally flip and flop on your behind if you aren't careful on smooth surfaces."
5,Best Flip-Flops Ever!,"Reef Women's Sandy SandalI have worn these sandals for years and really love them. The bottom of the shoe is thicker than the average flip-flop and the top straps are wider and have an embroidered design woven into them. The wide straps make them more comfortable. The part between your toes...that lots of women don't like; well, all I can say is that with these shoes, I barely notice that. My daughter lives near San Francisco and she lives in flip-flops, rain or shine. She wears these until she's worn them down! (And they are usually cheaper when you buy them through amazon.com.)"
3,Good for Flopping around,"I ordered one size larger and the length of the flip flops seems to work for me. However the banding is not tight enough for a secure fit. i can't imagine walking around outside to run a few errands. These are comfortable and adequate for around the house flip flopping--they do not serve as my quick, go to slip-ons for the outside."
4,Well....,"Well...first off let me just say that musically this CD is of course nothing really new. That's fairly obvious from the get-go.The majority of it is just straight-up rock and roll with Lester bangs having a somewhat average voice blah blah blah, anyway. What may spark some of the iffy reviews concerning this album is that...well, its not quite so demented as one might wish. When I picked this up I have to admit I was quite looking forward to musical nuttiness delivered, but then I got over my preconceptions and found that I really actually enjoyed this CD. I mean, its 70s rock 'n' roll but with something missing from so many rock 'n' roll bands of that era: Intriguing lyrics. Its basically the lyrics and Bangs' never-dull deliver that make this CD worth owning. I wouldn't go as far as to call it essential, but if one were stuck in a decision as to whether to buy MC5's ""Back in the USA"" and this CD, I'd definitely go with this one."
2,Not true to size,I found these socks were not true to size. They were much too loose all around. I am a size 6 or 7 depending on the shoe.The return process has been very costly and frustrating as well since the seller was not Amazon. I would skip these if you are on the fence.
5,great dvd.,"this is a great dvd. great songs on here like im alive,another holy war,somewhere far beyond, and the normal songs they play. great sound from the whole band especially the drums. i have only one complaint and that is that not all the songs that were played at the 2 day festival were on the dvd. run for the night,journey through the dark,time what is time,The Bard's Song (The Hobbit),born in a mourning hall were all played during the 2 day festival but somehow they didnt get on the dvd which is a shame. especially since journey through the dark and the hobbit were one of the best songs they ever wrote."
1,A disappointment,I was searching for folksongs and instead got some jazzed up rock type versions of classics.
5,Gradus ad Parnassum,These have been a standard etudes for more than a century. I enjoy the challenge. I wish I had time to do more in this and the succeeding Simandl etudes.
1,Received wrong unit,"The seller sent me the CA-81 unit. I specifically wanted the CA-80 though, and that's what this seller claims to be selling.The CA-81 is available elsewhere on Amazon for less money, so in effect I didn't get what I wanted, and I paid more for the ""privilege""."
3,"useful, but not built to last","I bought one of these a little less than a year ago in order to charge my iPod without using my computer. It's compact, and it seemed to charge my iPod faster than my computer did. So I was pretty happy with it-- until yesterday, when it inexplicably stopped working. Barring external catastrophe, I think a working life of under a year for one of these devices is pretty pathetic."
4,Interesting book,Through Dakota Eyes: Narrative Accounts Of The Minnesota Indian War Of 1862 is a book for those who have an interest in Native Americans.
5,very informative and easy to understand,"I highly suggest this book to anyone with cancer or if your helping someone with cancer. The information is very practical,easy to follow and lets you know that there is way more you can be doing than just what your doctor tells you. great book!"
4,Fun activity,"I bought this as something a little bit out of the ordinary to do with my 9-yr-old niece. It was a fun activity to do together. We kept it pretty basic, but I could see how you could definitely step it up and make some really pretty fairies with the right additional supplies. Even just using what came in the box we had fun and made some cute fairies to play with."
5,Totally Addicting!!,"So much fun! Easy. We had the kitchen table covered in flower fairies in no time. Then we took apart all the fabric flowers we could find. Then we combed our favorite thrift shop for more. Whew! They just got cuter and cuter. My kids are 9, 11 and 13. Then, we took them to school. Great response there. My 11 year old is a boy (into star wars, gi joe and transformer) and he even got involved. Put them on curtains, hair stuff, party bags. Fun, fun, fun."
5,A spectacular surprise!,"Wopat's album is an out-of-the-blue winner. His version of ""The Moon's A Harsh Mistress"" is worth the price of this collection, but every track is a winner. The easy and intimate manner of Tom's delivery is a wonder and the arrangements throughout are note-perfect! Put aside your preconceptions and let this CD find it's rightful place in your collection. You'll be glad you did."
1,waste of time,"This book is very bad, lacks almost everything you can think of, but if you don't know any better you probably won't care. It certainly needs to be supplemented by a respectable book if you want to learn derivatives (c.f. Hull's textbook, for example), and on the other hand, the math isn't rigorous at all, so you'll need a book on stochastic calculus (e.g. Michael Steele's, actually there are tons of better books out there, it's not hard to find better)."
4,Only one snag,"There is no portfolio analysis which ,I think, is basic to any book in financial math."
3,Fatal Chistmas Party,"What could be more conducive to a memorial holiday than snow and an ancient country house with eight indoor servants? Murder perhaps? Each guest is anxious to spend time alone with their host, but Nathanial Herriard quarrels with each one. When he is found stabbed in the back, in his own locked bedroom, the carefully planned party takes on a sinister aspect as each character realizes there is a killer in their presence.Each member of the party has something to hide and something to gain by the old man's death, yet Inspector Hemingway is stymied as to how the murder was committed.An excellent ""whodunit"" for all Heyer fans with very clever staging.Nash Black, author of ""Qualifying Laps"" and ""Sins of the Fathers."""
2,Not Rockabilly - should not be part of this series,This is far from Rockabilly! This starts with some mid 60's beat music by Billy Barry that at no time resembles the rockabilly tracks on the rest of the series I have listened to and does not get any better. The first Ronnie Dio track 'Do the OOP-POO-PAH-DOO' has a soul feel to it and the second track 'Love Pains' is more reminisent of the teen idol hits of the early 60's. Billy Balls' 'Motorcycle' is more rock and noise than Rockabilly. Charlie Starr provides the best track on the CD 'Black Jack Joey' but the rest of his offerings are purely pop. The Otis Blackwell track is interesting purely to compare to the version Elvis provided for the movie 'It happened at the worlds fair'. But again a pop offering not what we have come to expect from the 'That'll Flat Git Series'. This is one for you Hep Kats to skip - Generally a great series but this is the exception.
5,Great item,"I purchased this for my husband about christmas of 2010, he went and got 4 big speakers and some other things(I don't what they are), he put it in our basement. Its really really loud now. It was pretty loud before he added to it, I also purchased the ""Block Rocker""(from another site), so he had that in addtion to the smaller speakers that came with it. He loves it but he will be upgrading soon."
1,Whatever,I dont like this cd and Nas cant rap.He's just tryin to make some money.Dont buy it.It's not Illmatic
4,"""He doubles up and serves the same scenario""","I am beginning to feel like a series of my influential writing comes from Nasir Jones. This man is clearly ""The Disciple"" of the streets who takes the revolutionary extremities of modern music and brands it into hip hop of today. He holds no restraints from speaking the truth such as on ""These are our Heros"". What alot of people are failing to realize is that he does not take dissatisfaction in Tiger Woods but rather goes at Kobe Bryant. He actually pays homage and respect to Tiger for his accomplishment as an African American regardless of his discretions. Now the song that everyone has to listen to is U.B.R. (Unauthorized Biography of Rakim) which he narrates himself as the author. You know what: I am not going to say anymore about this album except DICIPLE STREETS"
5,Best Double Album since Life After Death,"There has been no album over the last few years that even compares to the mature subjects expressed in this album. No filler tracks, and yes, this like most other double albums could be classic if it were 1 CD, however, in its own right -- it's as close as a Double Album has gotten lately to being classic.Nas has shown over his last 3 albums a sense of consistency -- on point lyrics, good production and he actually is ""saying something"". Refreshing to see someone in the rap scene is keeping it close to the streets.A classic to be realized."
5,Likely the best double album since Life After Death...,"This is a killer album, to say the least, easily Nas's best effort since Illmatic. Nas, who is often criticized for his inconsistency, lacks none in this album, as even the more commercial joints like ""Makings of a Perfect B****"" have a unique and well thought out plot. Nas uses mainly Salam Remi, Chucky Thompson and L.E.S. as his producers, all of which try and bring back the old school and golden era of hip hop back into this album. Surprisingly, the last track (excluding the banger ""Thief's Theme"") ""Me and You"", where Nas harmonizes all thru the track, actually seems fit, and doesn't fit in with the corniness of past rappers singing like Eminem on the Eminem Show. All in all, a must buy for the Christmas season.Top 5 songs:Just a MomentLive NowStreets DiscipleWarRest of my life"
1,Yawn,"I know people are going to say that this CD is intentionally non commercial and is grown music. But the reason that its non commerical is because it appeals to nobody, and its nnot for the youth because people with a pulse could never enjoy this."
3,What happened?,"Frankly Nas didn't put his best foot forword with this one although its good its not great or spectacular like his previous efforts...and the Unauthorized Biography Of Rakim is a sad dedication to a hip-hop/rap God... its beat is enough to make you slam your head into a wall and the flow sounds peiced together...now Remember the Times is a good flow reminds me of older Nas... Me & You is a great song the dedication to his daughter...and Makings of the Perfect B*tch is a great tune also but all in all Nas could have did a lot better, Frankly he shoulda put some of the songs from Lost Tapes on Streets...because this album lacks greatly...a Nas fan can apprciate the few good tracks but for a person getting into Nas this isn't the album to do so...Illmatic would be a good bet for that..."
