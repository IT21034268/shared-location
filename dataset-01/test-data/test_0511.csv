3,Quality and price are good. But there is something smell like petroleum when I open it (vinyl cover).,"Quality and price of this item are good. But there is something smell like petroleum when I open it (vinyl cover). When I purchased the same item in public store, there is not smell. I don't know why.Anyway...Huggies Supreme Natural Fit is better for my baby. There is almost not some granule when I changed the diper compared to other Huggies product. I am like this item."
2,Pooh Designs Stained Babies Clothes!,I tried these a two years ago with my daughter and hated them because they stained our onsies. I thought I would try them again (hoping they had improved)with our baby boy and am very disappointed again. I'm kind of a clean freak and the brownish orange stains on the onsies are really dingy looking. We ran out of onsies a few weeks ago and put him to bed with just the sleeper over his diaper and it is RUINED! I have soaked it for days in Oxi Clean washed it eight times and is still not coming out.As far as leaks go they don't work overnight.
2,"leaky, leaky, leaky","I have a 15 and 13 yr old and when they were babiess, Huggies Supreme was my go to diaper. With my now 10 month old, I went straight to Huggies little snugglers. My love of Huggies was renewed until we hit size 4 and moved to the little movers. I can have him in my lap with a fresh clean diaper and have a wet lap! These diapers leak at the legs. And don't get me started with outings and constant issues of having to change his jeans shortly after leaving the house! This isn't an issue with keeping a diaper on too long (I'm a prompt changer) but a simple issue of a leaky diaper. Even though it doesn't take rocket science to apply a diaper, I have tried different ways (lower on back, puller up higher in front, snugger around waist) still he leaks. Numerous times he has woken from an hour nap to a wet bed. I just purchaged a HUGE box and am only into the second bag. Very frustrated and at this point, when this box is done, I will have no choice but to change brands."
1,Too soft to go into the wall,"I bought these hangers at my local Vons grocery store, and when I tried to drive the brads into the drywall they bent. I tried four times, result was four bent brads. No stars."
5,Writing Your Life: An Easy-to-Follow Guide to Writing an Autobiography,"Lucid and inclusive, Writing Your Life: An Easy-to-Follow Guide to Writing an Autobiography, help me to navigate my way through most difficult moments to recall. To get the right answers one must ask the right questions, and that is what this book is all about. Everyone no matter how insignificant should write an autobiography because that is the way to be remembered without being president or a movie star or whatever makes someone to be famous. You may not be a professional writer, but so what? Give it a try, do it for your amusement. You may find it more of a learning experience than a simple writing. Love the book and enjoyed at the same time."
4,Limited information,"While the information is incontrovertible as it pertains to assessing signs in the development of children, there is scarce information for assessing and living with adults. While I could identify symptoms in the history of my adult child, living with an adult with AS one looks for avenues of treatment and/or perspective. I found the latter to be sorely lacking."
3,Book Review,Good condition for it being an older book. Glad I was able to find it. Shipping time okay.
2,Lame,The hand held camera thing is getting old!Actors are sub par and cheesy and moldy and not all that pretty.
2,Not better than the remake,I bought this movie because other reviewers said it was so much better than the remake (Quarantine). I don't agree. The story is exactly the same but Rec is foreign and starts very slowly. If you have Quarantine you don't need this one.
2,Movie is great. English overdub kills the movie,"When I saw the movie in Spanish I was terrified. Granted I was alone, it was a really fun movie to watch in the dark at night. But the English overdub makes the whole thing feel like a joke. It sounds ridiculous and the voice acting makes the movie seem like a comedy rather than the scary movie it was meant to be in Spanish."
2,Dubbing kills this,"I should know better. I always avoid dubs. While I recall recently seeing a dubbed movie that was quite surprising, it wasnt this one.When dubbing is this bad, it is really hard to say if the movie had any merits, IMO."
3,BETTER THAN QUARANTINE,"To say this is the movie on which quarantine would be incorrect. Quarantine is a remake of this movie, down to the last scene. I wish I had never seen Quarantine before I watched this film as it ruined it. What makes this movie better is that there is less lame build up time at the fire department. I have a prejudice against these stupid cheap hand held movies. Having said that, this one wasn't too bad as much of the film didn't have that stupid herky-jerky motion, i.e. it was professionally shot and in wide screen. If you watch this film and haven't seen Quarantine, don't bother, or vice-versa."
2,It looks SO cool...Why does it suck???,"This is my very first cell phone, and while I admit I dont know whole lots about them, I do know some things, like how this phone is not so great. The Sprint rep gave me a deal on it (FREE) so i figured why not, all im going to use it for is calls and txts, but it is not good with them. The calls are the worst. All my friends have different providers, and they can understand me clearly, but I cant hear them well, the quality is horrible. There is an echo also, I DONT WANT TO HEAR MYSELF! It looks good. Its small. It feels good. Easy menu to me... BUT THE QUALITY SUX. Its not sprint, ITS THE PHONE. I dont reccomend it... now I know why I fot it ""free""."
1,"Not very good, connectivity very poor","You can put many pictures on the phone but there's no way to transfer them off without using Sprint Internet service. Same with Ringtone downloads and software upgrades. Can't use the bluetooth connection on the phone for much of anything useful except wireless headphone. Audio connection over bluetooth was extremely scratchy and noisy, unuseable."
3,Mixed Review,"I decided to read Vanished because I remembered when Jana Carpenter Koklich went missing and the subsequent arrest of Bruce Koklich. Admittedly, I was positively predisposed towards the book because I live in and am very familiar with the Long Beach/Lakewood/Signal Hill area where it takes place. The mystery of Jana Carpenter Koklich's disappearance is fascinating. Yet, while reading the accounts in Vanished, I felt that more in depth information was needed. I would have liked for Carlton Smith to have included more specific identification of locations, additional background information/physical descriptions of the people in Vanished (other than just those in the family of Carpenter and Koklich), and more adjectives throughout. Despite this, I couldn't put it down."
1,Not at all what I wanted.....,"I wanted a dream explainer as described 'dream reader', and what I've got was a lot of scientific info about dreams."
2,Amazing. The software almost always crashes,"Although I read previous reviews here complaining about unstable software, I purchased one, thinking I can handle it. Wow. This software crashes almost always. Used only for a few days, but a lot of time is already lost. I've updated verison 10.5 but no help. This one is just simply bad and not worth. I am going to return this product."
4,Gilmore Girls keeps on Glowing!,I loved this book! Rory's and Loreali's life is so interesting. You know that Jess causes a big factor when he comes into Stars Hallow. (You know this if you have been keeping up to the TV show on the WB) I recommend that you read the previous Gilmore Girls books first to fully understand this one. This was a great book and the only reason that I didn't give it five stars was becasue I am not sure of it's clarity to those who are not familiar with the Tv series.
2,Book is ok,The book basically is a retelling of the 2nd season of Gilmore Girls. It didn't tell me anything I didn't already know.
4,I Think It's......,I think that the Ultra racer is pretty cool!! It looks like its complicated to use though. Otherwise it looks ok to me!!
2,shallow coverage - 700+ pages should have done a better job,"This book covers a lot of topics - but lacks in-depth explanation on many important stuffs. I tried to reference the book to help me with some Excel automation. However, the 40 Excel pages in the book helps only a little. Not a single word on 'charts', poor presentation on 'Range', no mention of Excel built-in functions... MS user's guide or online help is much better. The coverage on other parts look just like the Excel."
2,misadvertised,"This is not a full size muffin pan. Nowhere on the product description does it state the size. However, Amazon also sells a ""mini muffin"" pan by Oneida, so one would assume that this is full size. That is not the case. If you are looking for a full size 24 cup muffin tin, you might want to check a restaurant supply store. I will be returning mine, though it does appear to be of sturdy construction."
3,Stinky!!,"I really like to way it holds. BUT--the smell is horrible. I had a project of decorating a tote bag for a friend, but the smell is atrocious. I have had it airing out in my garage for three days and the smell is still horrible. I hope it fades after a bit, otherwise the bag will be useless. The glue does very good at holding; ribbons, feathers, buttons, etc. Like the glue, but hate the lingering odor."
5,Best stuff on the market,"I wish I had discovered this product years ago -- now that I have, I won't use any other other glue. It has a bundred uses, will seal just about anything, and yet is easy to remove if needed. Absolute must-have for any household or toolbox."
2,goop,"I love the produce,Goop. This glue cannot be beat. The only thing I did not like was the fact that with the added on shipping I could buy it cheaper in one of our local stores. All the goops are actually the same formula but in different tubes with different names so look for the cheepest one."
5,Comfiest heels I own!,"I can wear these (and others from the Mini Heel line) all day with no problems. Say goodbye to wobbly ankles, inability to run in heels, sinking into squishy mud (a problem during the rainy season here in Seattle), and heels falling into streets grates, and say hello to all-day comfort, style, and many, many compliments!"
5,Excellent,I took a chance by buying this CD based on a bunch of reviews here and there on the Internet. This is the most unique and refreshing Jazz album I have heard in a long time. I'm hoping that I can catch this band live...cause every person in this quartet plays with precision and emotion...
1,Fraudulent information,"While Mr. Montaigue shows clear knowlege of your basic accupuncture points (something you can easily learn from the multitude of existing teachers and manuals,) he tries to convince the reader that touching certain points in certain sequence will cause a KO.Being quite familiar with the concepts of accupuncture, I can vouch for the accuracy of the ponts, but don't assume that striking them will cause the very opposite of the effect they are intented to treat, or a KO for that matter.In conclusion, I have yet to be knocked out by anything lighter than a hard strike to the head or neck, which you don't need to be a dim mak master to pull off. Take the written material with a large dose of skepticism."
5,Don't Look at the Stars,NCAA Football 07:9.25/10This is a great game depite being almost exactly the same as last years version. The kicking game to me is a lot easier but that's just my opinion. Campus Legend is very fun . This year you also have to worry about your grades. Dynasty mode is about the same. There is a new mode called Spring Drills. It's okay but really it's just a bunch of mini games. The graphics are awsome as usual.
2,Same game.. same glitches.. horrible kicking game,"I've been a huge fan of this game.. I prefer this to Madden. Get it every year when it comes out. Nothing has changed. $50.00 for new rosters (with names you have to enter in yourself anyway). Same glitches - if your opponent has momentum, expect to fumble every ball, drop every catch, and have 80 yard touchdowns scored on you every time. Commentary is also still the same. These are all flaws present in the earlier versions I loved, and those versions would recieve a 5 from me every time. So what's the deal with the 2 this year? THE KICKING GAME SUCKS!!!! It is so confusing and hard to control all the new apects, that just after 3 games played, I am ready to toss it or trade it in and resort to the 2006 NCAA version. Horrible"
1,Failure,FailureWe never got this item. It was ordered in December and has not arrived. We are extremely dissappointed. This is not acceptable!
5,This Product Works Wonders!,"I purchased this product out of desperation after trying Anusol, Prep H, sitz baths, and cold compresses. This is the first time I needed anything for Hemorrhoidal problems and this medication worked miracles overnight!It is a bit messy and black in color however once you get passed this you'll never go back to using anything but this product."
1,"the only book on the subject so it may be worthwhile, but","It's the only book I could find on the subject and it was a disappointment. If I learned enough to make it worth the $, it was just barely.A large part of what is said is rehashing what is intuitive and there is very little insight beyond that.The 101 title leads you to believe that it is for beginners and I guess that is true for the most part, but a beginner will struggle with the installation instructions the book gives."
2,Bad,"First the gun is tiny and easy to break, second it has about 200 fps which is awful, third the bbs go out like a few feet then just sink. the only good thing was it has a fast rate of fire. Fun for a while but probably not what your looking for."
3,"Havent gotten it yet, but have ordered it and here are my thoughts so far","This product has gotten alot of reviews from users and most of them seem to be good, alot of the people who rate five stars seem to know what their talking about and take care of this gun along with all of their other guns. Not to mention that this gun has gotten mostly five stars. And seeing as the only two people who rated one star have terrible spelling and grammar mistakes, I dont think I'll be taking any advice from them...I'll make sure to update my rating for the gun once it gets a around the first of June."
4,good beginer gun,i am an pro at airsoft i bought this gun for a friend of mine that was just getting into airsoft battles so i showed it him and he really liked but for me it was bad compared to my guns so buy it if your a beginer but dont buy it if your a pro like me
5,The Best One!,"I was looking for a hand held, lightweight stair cleaner. This is by far, the BEST one I have ever purchased! It's powerful, does an outstanding job, is lightweight, and has a long cord, which makes doing the stairs so easy! I LOVE IT!!!! Love the fact that it is easy to empty, NO BAGS, and really does get my stairs clean! No lugging my upright over to the stairs and fighting with it! LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT"
4,Excellent for pet hair in carpet and upolstery,"I purchased this hand held vacuum to get the dog hair off the sides of my couch and from my carpeted stairs. The first couple of competing products I tried failed, because the beater bar was powered by the vacuum suction. That is not the case with this unit. The beater bar is powered by a belt connected to the very powerful motor. It will strip the hair out of upolstery and carpet very easily. The downside for me is that the container fills very quickly with pet hair, and needs frequent emptying, but this is proof that it is doing a good job."
5,Much better than the old model!,I purchased this vacuum ($40+tax at Best Buy) to replace my old red Dirt Devil with the bag and onboard tools. The tools on my old one were constantly falling off while I was vacuuming.This new model is a HUGE improvement! The suction is amazing! I used it on our carpeted stairs that I just had steam cleaned last week and was surprised at all the junk it sucked up. The clear dirt cup is much better than the disposable bags and emptying it is a breeze. I like how the tools attach and the crevice tool seemed to work well. The cord is long enough to vacuum the entire stairway and then some. I would recommend this vaccum to anyone who is tired of lugging their upright up and down the stairs!
4,Filter Clogging Fix,Tried this out and was amazed how good the rotating brush worked on the stairs. Like others I noticed the HEPA filter was almost clogged. I reversed sprayed the filter in the kitchen sink using the sink sprayer and that kind of worked. Not wanting to buy a bunch of HEPA filters I put one of those rectangular face masks like hospital people use over the filter and held it in place with a rubber band and it worked! Not wanting to use all my shop filter masks I cut the end off an old (white) sweat sock and put over the filter with a rubber band to hold it airtight in place (at the very bottom of the filter) and that worked even better! Old sock or cut the foot off of your wife's pantyhose would probably work also. See if she notices a foot missing.
3,"Okay for pet hair, attachments not that great.","This vaccum is good for certain uses, not so good for others. The suction on the vac is very good compared to others I've tried. It is good for vacuuming up pet hair on couches and anywhere else with a flat surface in which you have enough space to maneuver the vac (with its wide mouth) without attachments. It is not so good for using as a car vac and I would not suggest it for that purpose (since it has a wide mouth and can't maneuver easily in a vehicle). The attachments are pretty worthless as they do not clip on the body of the vac very well and continually come off. Suction is not so good when using the attachments."
4,Product was exactly what I needed.,"This product was purchased to take care of a need with a janitorial requirement. All product was delivered in different deliveries and did take a little time, but product arrived complete and ready to use. Keep in mind I purchased over 20 of these units, which may have caused the back order in this case, which should not be held against supplier."
1,Disappointed,I have always loved Dirt Devil vacuums until now. This vacuum has barely any suction when used alone and absolutely none when you use the attachment. NOT worth buying. Would not have even given it 1 star except that at least 1 is required to post the review
3,It's going back today.,"We picked this up to do the stairs in our house. It did an alright job, I'm happy enough with the cleaning power, but the belt fell off within the first 10 minutes of use. That's a harbinger of a pain-in-the-rear appliance, so - it's going back. We'll buy the Eureka, which was our second choice due to price and had similar reviews.The other thing is, it's REALLY unbalanced - very front heavy, which I suppose is fine if you're just vacuuming horizontal surfaces, but could be a pain when doing anything vertical. Just a thought."
2,Okay not great,I used my friend's shield blaster 2000 and it's biggest nozzle shot 13 feet. The guns shield looks not to good but it deflected two water ballons thrown by one realy strong teenager.The idea of a super soaker with a shield built in is a good idea but the gun should have had a trigger and drop the blasted crank.And what they call a pro strap should have been called looser crap.If you use this blaster in a water fight make sure it is NOT your primary weapon. The most awsome combo would be the shield blaster 3000 and the A.R.M. 4000 XL.(see my review on the A.R.M. 4000 XL)
3,cool toy bad shield,the shield kept fallin down. the arm strap is hard to fit through. plus i'm a leftie so its hard.
3,IT's Time to Go Deeper into Our Spirituality,"I have a difficult time with this book - I don't think Mary was married to Jesus, but I do think she was an apostle, and later scorned by the later male Christians because she was a woman. I see us as living now in a time of new thought - computers and Bible Code, newly found ancient manuscripts,as in the Dead Sea scrolls, the Thomas Gospel, and such books that teach people to use prayer and holy spirit for helping the FBI, finding missing children, etc as in Tiffany Snow's book Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life. Religion may have a bad name in many ways, but going deeper can put it all together, and strengthen spiritual values again. Its time to go deeper, but weigh it all out as you go, carefully."
2,Skip this Edition - Get the Karen King Edition,"Leloup's edition of the Gospel of Mary Magdalene is of minimal value in light of the new publication of an authoritative edition by Karen King: The Gospel of Mary of Magdala. Karen King's edition offers both a far superior translation of the original text, and a superb commentary on importance and interpretation of the Gospel of Mary.If you do choose to purchase this Leloup edition, please be sure and also pick up a copy of King's new edition. Then judge for yourself."
4,The Gospel of Mary Magdalene,"The Gospel of Mary Magdalene is a heavy read. The Forward and Preface are scholarly done and, as usually is the case, the prose requires focused attention to follow and absorb. This was my first exposure to a Gnostic text and I found it very interesting. It also cleared up, in my mind, why gnosticism was not embraced by the majority of the Nicean Convention. I would recommend this book to the student wishing a fuller understanding of the politics at work in the early church. However I pose a caveat to those less secure in their faith. The early church did not simply spring forth in the form we have to day and those convinced that it did will find the book troubling at best. Others will be intrigued by the jostling of opposing viewpoints and opinions, and find that seeing them will deepen their belief that the early church fathers were capable scholars intent on finding the correct course to follow."
1,Muppets Out With Your Money,"This game is rated 'E' for everyone. If everyone is brain dead, they might enjoy this game. Or, it's 'E' for early readers. A four or five year old might enjoy this game. We were hoping for something similar to 'Muppets Inside' a very good computer game. The graphics are not good. It isn't much fun. I'm not sure why this game was produced. Perhaps, they were just testing the waters to see if there was interest in a Muppets game. Well, if it was a good game, yes. But, don't waste your money on this. There is no challenge, no replayability. If you want a Muppets game for your GBA, get 'Muppets Pinball.' It's fun, and replayable, you will enjoy that one. Or, if you can find 'Muppets Inside' for your computer...get that."
3,Save your money and buy a better treatment,"EXREMELY DRYING FOR THE SKIN BECAUSE ALMOST HALF OF IT IS ALCOHOL!!!! I hope you guys know that putting so much alcohol on your skin only aggravates your acne and oil over production, as your skin gets stressed out, not even talking about the aging effect... In description of the product it says ""non irritating""... Non irritating my butt!!! In addition my skin became extremely red and ugly looking, lost its natural luster and beautiful tone after just a couple of days of use... Does it help clear spots? Seems like it's helpful, but not exceptional. Seems like there's more bad than good effect. So never ever will I put this stuff on my entire face again, only spot treating, until I run out of it and buy a better product."
3,does this work?,am i missing something. i put this on and 8 hours later the little pimple is still there. is there like a use product for x amount of days before results? this doesnt realyl give results to my boyfriend either.
1,Won't work on Windows7,"I bought the Crazy Machines collection (three CDs), because I have already gone through all the TIM levels. I was hoping for some slightly different puzzles. Unfortunately, none of them work. After installation, I had a problem getting the program to start. Once I got that issue sorted out (after much research online), the program starts, but the cursor is invisible, making it impossible to actually use the game. I've managed to open a level, by carefully moving the mouse, and noting when a selection was 'highlighted' (not easy to see). After the level opens, however, it just doesn't work.I visited the Crazy Machines website, and asked for advice using their 'Contact Us' link. They never replied.If you are running anything above Win XP, don't waste your money."
3,Hangs up briefly,Fun to play but brief hangs are annoying. Once I had to reboot. Mostly just wait a few seconds.
4,Its works for us,"My husband and I saw an article on this product and tried it over the weekend. We can definitely see a distinct difference. If the first treatment does not help, try it for another 3 - 4 times and you will see the difference. The lotion works to dissolve the blackheads."
1,Review of Amazon.com,"How can one decide whether to purchase this album, when Amazon.com fails to provide a list of the artists? Amazon includes a list of the songs and artists with other albums, why not this one? I really don't want to buy it if all it contains are the second (or third, fourth, etc.) iterations of the same songs by the same artists as are featured on other albums in my collection."
4,little but loud,"These speakers are hanging on the wall in my master bedroom along with a 37"" Sharp LCD, which matches these in finish to a ""T"". I have them matched to a JVC receiver/dvd which produces 100 watts per channel. I am perfectly happy with the satellites but the subwoofer is a little boomy and over-powering (set sub switch to ""music""), otherwise I might have considered rating this system a 5. Satellites seem to be quality built with aluminium housings and have a very clean tight response. They may not be the system for a large room but work great in a bedroom and will handle plenty of power to be ""too loud"" for small to moderate size rooms. I made my wall brackets out of 3"" L brackets and sprayed them with aluminium paint."
3,Review,"Interesting book with some good ideas - babies in developing countries don't wear nappies yet they're not continually wet and dirty so how do they do it. There are some good tips and some ideas to try but possibly not a method for anyone who isn't fully committed to spending their lives observing their baby and prepared for a LOT of accidents along the way. Overall verdict: a good read with some ideas about how to integrate potty training into a day to day routine of a baby and so make it easier when you potty train 'properly' but not a particularly realistic way of living life with a baby (at least, not in my world)"
3,Plastic Hood for Diecast !!!,"While this car is pretty nice, The Sellers conveniently ignored to inform that the Hood and Lid are plastics. It sucks as a diecast."
2,Hmmmm.,"I heard great things about this, especially from writers that I trust, such as Ted Sturgeon and Ursula LeGuin. My IQ must not be as high as the others on this site, witness the poor star rating. To my mind, this book was very well written but serving no point, like a great big beautiful car with no engine. The story moves rather inventively back and forth through time, for some purpose other than literary showmanship, I imagine. Sorry to be so vague on the inhabitants of Edgewood and Smoky Barnable and Daily Alice and Grandfather Trout and all the other characters that should be memorable but aren't, but this novel is one vague miasma itself. Not that I am impartial to fantasy; another fantasy novel I read earlier this year, Mikhail Bulgakov's Master & Margarita, was far superior to Little, Big in terms of style, plot and theme."
4,A midsummer night's dream,"John Crowley's Little Big is a marvelously well written fairytale set in a bygone America that never was. Generations of the Drinkwater/Barnable clan live in a wonderfully mysterious house in the country whose grounds get larger the deeper you go into them and whose rooms and hallways don't always open into the same rooms and hallways you've entered from. The girls in the family commune with the fairy kingdom that the house is a gateway to, and the boys in the family spend their lives trying to figure out if the fairies are real. These details, and many, many delightful others are somewhat secondary, however, to the wonderful mood of the narrative, a melancholy dream state of the sense of wonder only children can seem to have in a world that in its smallness is the biggest they will ever inhabit. Crowley never hits a wrong note in the best of times and the worst, and the ending is supremely satisfying."
5,Unexpected treasure,"This was either a birthday or a Christmas gift from my husband, I can't quite remember which, late last year or early this. I never would have heard about it otherwise, but I'm so glad he found it and thought of me when he saw this book. This book moves with fluidity like a dream, incorporating tarot, fae, and multiple generations in a wonderful experience of magical realism. I'd recommend it to most people who consider themselves more than the occasional light reader."
5,Anyone think this looks like JADE??????,I do...It's like Jade's SISTER!!! Or....IS IT??? I duno...Anywayz this Bratz is the coooolest and it's LOVELY!
5,Something for everyone!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! It has a little of everything in it--sci-fi, romance, humor, violence. Just read it and you'll see."
1,Ok for awhile,"This item has worked fine for me with a few exceptions. The problem I'm having now is that I need a new driver for my laptop. You cannot access www.nixvue.com, and JoBo does not answer the phone or repeated e-mails. This thing is useless without the drivers. I'm not sure the company is even in business any more and I probably would not buy another with this kind of support."
1,Very bad sound quality,"I have always loved this movie and was glad to buy it on DVD, but when I got it the sound didn't work. I had to max out the volume on my tv and surround sond just to barley hear it. I sent it back and they sent me another one but it was the same way."
4,"Comforting, Comfortable, Funny - You'll Want to Share It","This slim volume of prosaic poems (they are barely poems, more like very graceful essays) on encroaching senior-hood is really enjoyable. And comfortable, and comforting to read, much in the same way the classic ""Golden Girls"" TV show is, in a ""you're not alone in this aging business, all us women are going through the same things!"" way. I especially loved the ""New Alphabet,"" which includes things like ""O is for osteo, P's for porosis,"" and the poem about the two lovers who can't take their eyes off each other -- and it turns out the ""man"" is her four-year-old grandson. Thanks to Judith for reaching through the LA-nip/tuck-gym hardbody BS in this world, and telling it like it is."
4,"The best way to face sixty is to make fun of it, that is what Viorst does","I have not yet hit the landmark sixtieth birthday, but I am closing on it rather fast. It is clear to me that the best way to approach that fateful day is to laugh about it and one of the best ways to accomplish that is to read this book. In general, it pokes good clean fun at aging, although there is an occasional bitter tone when describing some of the more unpleasant aspects of life. Independent of your age, life is what we make of it and Viorst makes fun of what we all will hopefully face someday, the arrival of the sixtieth birthday. After all, the alternative really isn't a great deal of fun to contemplate"
1,A Disappointment,"I just ordered this book and am sorry I did. Where is the Judith Viorst of the 70's, when my children were young and loved her work? I expected this to be a light-hearted and original look at being ""the age we are now,"" but instead, I found a woman sour -- especially with marriage -- and to a degree with life and grown children. I would not recommend it."
3,suddenly sixty and other shocks of later life,it wasn't as humorous as some other books i have read on this subject
5,Love the drawing pad,My nephew loves the fact that he doesn't have to scrounge around for pieces of paper when he wants to get to drawing. He is one Happy Camper. Thank you again.
3,Okay. Arrived late.,"I was told it would arrive before Christmas but it arrived two days after. The product is great though, nice paper, though I wish I hadn't bought such nice paper because my little brother is prone to giving up and just throwing a whole sheet away for a tiny mistake"
4,It was a gift,The drawing pad was a Christmas gift for a young girl that shows artistic capabilities. I understand she is pleased with it.
3,"Certainly quite good, BUT","This brand is certainly quite good, but I have to wonder that it costs what it does. A competing brand was shown together with this product as recommendations to go with a drawing kit, and it contains twice as many pages for half the money.For keeps? Great. Only the best? Fine. Then how to frame around the ""jaggies"" that result when it's torn out?"
2,Misleading title and product info,I ordered this pad thinking it has 400 pages but only has 24 pages. The number of sheets is not mentioned anywhere in the product description.
5,Worked great,Soldered up to a pioneer deck harness with ease and plugged right in like it said it would. Wire colors even matched the ones coming off the deck so impossible to screw up. Bag is labeled just in case. Good product and fast shipping.
1,What a load of rubbish,"I watched this and soon resorted to watching the paint on the walls dry, it was drap and cack, i would recommend staying well away from this at all costs!!"
5,BEST YET!,"For all of you Janet Kleinaholics this is the best album yet. Her voice is more assured, and the musicianship and song choices are tops. I can't wait for her next endeavor."
4,Entertaining and to the point --- in story format.,"Having grown up learning about the 10 commandments, it was interesting to see how the writer brought other's lives into the big scope of God's Laws regardless of the time frame or plot of the story. Because of the 10 individual stories, I was able to read them out of sequence and at my own pace. There is something for everyone in this book. I encourage all families to have one in their library and would encourage their children to read it as well. I will mine!!!!!"
4,Serious head trip,"Gunsmith Cats: Bad Trip picks up where cliffhanger of Goldie Vs. Misty left off, with Rally being forced into Goldie's service. The prospect of Rally's abilities used for evil is frightening, but fortunately she's stronger than she's given credit for. As usual, the art is gorgeous, the action is intense, and the storytelling is always engaging. Nudity and violence abound. Plus, despite its size as one of the shortest GSC collections, the plot is full of twists and surprises, and one of the most bizarre, hallucinogenic shootouts found in Gunsmith Cats or anywhere else. Rally's dug herself into the deepest hole she's been in yet--Bad Trip is as hard core as the series has ever been. Don't get it if you haven't read Goldie Vs. Misty, though--they're basically companion volumes. I highly recommend the entire series."
5,Breathing easier,"I do a lot of router work with MDF, which creates more dust than any other material I've used. Before buying this respirator, I was using a smaller mask with separate safety goggles. The combination was never really a good fit, and my goggles would frequently fog up. That's a huge safety hazard in a shop full of sharp, pointy things spinning at incredible speeds. That problem has been eliminated with the MSA product. I'd recommend this to anyone working in a dusty environment who would like to continue breathing into old age."
4,Great Shave...Just Expensive (But Less So on Amazon),"Buying new blades for your razor is never a pleasant experience. They are expensive and your struggle with justifying the cost each time. However, I will say that Amazon has once again come to the rescue with the Gillette Fusion Power blades.These blades are about 20% cheaper on Amazon.com than they are in any other store near me.As for the product, these blades give you a great shave. I can usually get through about 3 weeks before needing a new blade. I have found that cleaning the blade with HOT water after each shave lengthens the time between needing a replacement. The shave with this blade is very close. The first time you use with, you will feel it gently glide against your skin. I have yet to receive a cut with using this blade. Of course, just be careful when using it.4/5 Stars...price the only downside but you will not find it cheaper anywhere else. Amazon has the best price for these blades and I have been using them for years."
1,What a disappointment!,"This book actually made me angry. I feel the title is misleading to the point of fraud. Not only will you not master slide scanning (or any scanning) with this book, you won't even get to first base. The author natters on and on about everything under the sun remotely connected to scanning but gives next to no information on how to actually scan! Some people are saying that it might be good for beginners, but I really disagree. It's almost completely lacking basic, basic information anybody, especially beginners, would need to get good results. I am in complete agreement with the critical reviews by Mark Zelyony, Bernd Schneitler, and Mick36522. Conversely, I am amazed at some of the laudatory reviews. Whatever you guys are smoking, I want some too!"
2,I'm Returning This Out of Date Book,"This book may have been useful in 2003 when it was written, but in the hyper changing digital world, it's now (2008) seriously out of date. As a consequence nearly everything specific about particular hardware or software is not useful. I'm returning the book."
2,Thorough but general and basic: not a book of tutorials about scanning film,"There is plenty of good information in this book, but none of it was particularly helpful to me.I agree with the reviewer who said that ""there is nothing here for someone seeking information about making scans from difficult transparencies"". I've been scanning film off and on for several years. I was expecting/hoping for much more information of that kind of when I bought the book.Anyone interested in this subject should spend some time looking through this book in a bookstore rather than just buying it online and hoping for the best, to see if it really meets your expectations or needs."
3,They killed Taiwanese aborigines!?,"I've met a few Hakka but I've only met one Taiwanese aborigine and he's brilliant. Why would you instigate a fight with the original Taiwanese when in Taiwan? Apparently, stupidity is not limited to any one or two groups."
1,Not Stargazer Lilies pink lilies,These were straight pink lilies not Stargazers and it only came with 3 Stems not 10 as advertised also No card so she had no idea who sent them! The vase was with it but No lemon leaf or Eucalyptus which in the description it said 2 stems of each this is not acceptable and I am not Happy for the money I spent!! VERY disappointed!!!!!!! shipped from Nikki's Gift Baskets By: Pro Flowers!!
3,Not sure it's any better than the old one.,Hope it lasts longer than the original. Same brand as one that cracked around the screw holes. Should be made more durable.
2,Poor quality hat,"This is a very poor quality hat. I give it 2 stars because of its reasonable price. The hat in reality is not as white as the photo wants you to believe. Very cheap felt and vinyl ribbon.It is okay if you use it for a Halloween night where no one examines it carefully; but you definitely can't use it for daily occasions. If I had known this poor quality, I'd rather pay a little more for a better quality hat which I can wear for other occasions."
5,YES!!!,I am a huge fan of Night Court -- I cannot wait for this - I will go broke if it means I can get all 9 seasons!!
5,One of the best series of all time,"What else needs to be said? This was one of the best series ever on TV.20 years later, it is still enjoyable.Please buy many copys for yourself and friends and family to show your support and encourage the studio to put out the rest of the seasons."
1,Letter Writing,"Using the address she found on her copy of Season 1, my roommate sent Warner Brothers a letter in the U.S. Mail in which, she wrote about the number of reviews at Amazon in general, most if not all of which were asking where the second season was. She also wrote that without the rest of the series, she might as well send them her copy of the first as it is no good to her without them.I agree that Warner Brothers is being a complete idiot in this case. I realize they don't care about us as people, but I thought they cared about money. Maybe I was wrong..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!! It is a vhs copy onto dvd!!!!!,this was a vhs copied onto dvd and very poor one at that!!!!!!! THE ALL REGION DVD proves thats its not a studio release.i did not see this until after i ordered this item.the dvd-disc itself looks professional.way over priced for a vhs transfer.. there was one part in the film when the vhs auto tracking was seen on the dvd and there were several dark sceens in the film as well....very disapointed ......waiting a long time for this film to be released on to dvd format. guess i have to wait longer!!!!!!
1,Probably Counterfeit.,I couldn't wait to receive the dvd in the mail. Ripped open the packaging and popped it into the dvd player and was immediately let down.This is most likely a counterfeit item because the picture quality is poor. The picture is grainy and fuzzy and the audio is mediocre at best. It was either made by copying with a camera from the screen or from an internet rip.No way this was made from a master of the movie. The disk has an inkjet label stuck onto a DVD and the artwork on the box is cheap and amateurish and looks like a 3 color xeroxI would not throw my money away if I were you. I wasted good money on this substandard copy.CAVEAT EMPTOR!
3,A warning about water guns...,"What I have come to learn of most water guns is that they are all extremely heavy and sometimes the range is a bit bad. The triggers are also hard to pull and pumps hard to pump. So this is a fair warning to all of you concerned parents out there... Do not buy any type of water gun if you are concerned that your child is too young to play with it. This water gun is not the heaviest water gun out there and even my sister can use it. DO NOT THINK ABOUT GETTING A SUPER SOAKER IF YOUR CHILD CANNOT HANDLE THIS GUN. If you do not think that a heavy gun would be appropriate for your child, buy a water pistol instead. They are extremely light, require no pumping, and are affordable. Of course, their range and soaking power is bad but what can you expect?"
1,Does not go through dishswasher,"I returned this before even using once. The reason I went with this one is that I thought the all-metal version would be OK for the dishwasher. Upon arriving, I didn't see anything on the packaging that said you couldn't. So, I did. It came out black and had a powder-like substance that was rubbing off. (i.e. would end up in the food). Unacceptable. This mixer has been around for over a century...I don't know why they cant figure out a product that is dishwasher safe by now."
1,Dimensions are off...,With so many beaters to choose from I measured the beater I already have to get something equivalent. I ordered this beater because the dimensions were similar to the one I needed. Unfortunately the dimensions must be for the box because the beater is MUCH smaller than what the measurements states.
4,Burnished Beater,If you have problem with the white beater that came with your mixer with it flakeing off here's one that will solve that problem. Exact fit to the K5SS unit I have. It works great and without the flakeing that the old used one had. I hear it will discolor if put in the dishwasher so hand washing isn't much so I'll do that to keep it nice.
2,Average episode at best,"""Skin of Evil"" is basically about a rescue attempt of two Enterprise crewmen on Vagra II (counselor troi and a mostly ignored, unimportant crewman whose name is never really mentioned) which results in a really senseless tragedy. An evil alien force named Armus kills Yar and torments the crew while they attempt to rescue Troi and the other crewman. I found the plot really average, and the special effects left a lot to be desired.The only reason I bought this episode because my favorite character was Tasha Yar, and I collect ST:TNG episodes myself. If you are looking for a memorable, exciting episode, and you don't particularly care about Tasha Yar, then don't buy it. I don't think you'd like it.However, the ending on this episode is its saving grace; it is really touching and great, and even I had to shed a few tears. At least they gave Tasha the proper send off! It's too bad that Yar dies senselessly in this episode and is soon forgotten by the crew."
4,Nice video,Nice video but too much commercials in the beginning. Somehow I missed this episode and now completed my collection with this one. I'm not going to say anything about the content except it is a certified ST stuff. It sure is worth watching.
2,Don't buy unless your child is atleast a young teen!,"I purchased this thinking my son would be able to use this considering this is a ""Junior"" bow. I would call it a ""teenager"" bow because there is no way a kid can use this. It's way too big and it's too hard to pull back. I shipped back. Huge disappointment! Purchased a different bow from another place that is smaller and less weight to pull back and is actually a kid bow. I would only recommend this if your child was a young teen or teenager. It would be great for that."
4,Great product. Lots of power.,"We bought this for our 7 year old and he is a little too small to pull back the string. My 9 year old, however, loves it and is able to use it no problem. So, I would recommend it for 9+. It packs a bit of power too, so you have to be careful where you are shooting it!"
5,"Great for beginners, OURS came packaged differently and DID include all parts.","Works well and my 9 YO daughter has no trouble with the pull force. Arrows are sorta cheapy but fine to learn. Now ours arrived in a box and included a foam padded target, a spare target, a wrist guard, a finger grip/guard, an adjustable sight, bow and 2 arrows. All of the ones I've seen online are packaged much differently which would not allow for the items stated. Even the one actually shown for our order is without a box. We got ours from Big5.com. [...]Overall pleased with this item."
2,waste of $30... worked for a week,"Got a pair of these as a gift for my 2 boys. They used them 3 times, yes 3 times. Once shooting in our back yard, once at our local park, and once at an actual archery range. On our walk back to our truck, one of them literally fell apart in my son's hands. Some pin holding the pulley just fell out causing the bow to collapse. I guess its ok for sub $30, one time use thing, but I should have just searched craigslist for a nicer used bow. also, the arrows are horrible and started falling apart after the first time."
1,cheap...but not in a good way.,"I expected to be able to use the bow set right out the box; this was not possible since the bow was strung backwards, causing the strings to obstruct the arrow from being able to rest on the handle as you aim. Also, the finger roller and arm guard are incredibly cheaply made."
3,Good bow - description could be better,I bought this for my 6 year old son. It's much too heavy for him to pull. I figure it's best for ages 8 and up. Got him a Bear bow with lighter pull and he loves that. Once he grows into this one I think it'll work well too.
4,Arrows,"I found this arc of very good quality, but the arrow did not like because he was falling limb.Is easy for the kids!"
1,Returned it,It was ordered in error I thought it had way too many strings. I have observed a kid on the archery range with one and he was very frustrated with it. Glad I returned it.
5,Great Resource Book for Electricity Play!,"This book came out in 1998 and really takes an indepth and humorous look at the use of electricity in play (chapter 13 is titled, ""Be afraid, be very afraid""). The book spends the first half in review of how electricity works and then overviews everything from the carpet shuffle zap to household voltage. Fans of the violet wand and the tens unit will find support here. This book is a must for anyone wanting to be well informed before venturing into pleasure with electricity. All the advice is sound and very like what is experienced through the use of currents. The author clearly tells the readers what is absolutely not acceptable as a toy and what is potentially dangerous. Electricity is extremely pleasing in the right hands. (The shocking animal collar is a real attention getter!) Is that my hair standing up? Interesting book!"
5,Worked Fine,This gauge worked as advertised and is great quality. I ordered it to diagnose and repair my auto a/c. I also ordered the Mastercool 85510 R134a Can Tap to add freon.
3,Not as pictured!,"Be aware the this gauge set does not ship with the hoses pictured. I was hoping for the 1/4"" quick connects to do some work on a stationary air conditioner, but it arrived with hoses that have different ends that fit automotive adapters. They are NOT 1/4"" female connectors. I will have to get different hoses or adapters to finish my project. The manifold connections are 1/2 Acme, standard hose sets for R-12 or R-22 will NOT fit. Note: it appears that the company has changed the description since I ordered, but not the picture."
1,Sad,"the elastic band is too thick for my yorkies fine hair, and it just lasts a few hours and wears off its not properly glued, wish it was with better quality also i didnt quite exactly receive what was on the photo!"
4,Easy install works great,Installed the main unit in less than two hours. Routing the wires takes a little more if you want to be neat. Function is great. Picks up my 20' x8'. Door all the way to above the opening in the wall. No problems with power close. Reason for 4 stars is it's a little bit much to only come one door opener for the car
1,Nice Product - louzy service,"I ordered the Liftmaster, but upon arrival I discovered I did not have the necessary vertical clearance to install. I contacted Garage Intel for a return authorization. They granted the RMA request - I of course had to pay the $30.00 for return shipping. I just received confirmation that the refund has been processed after a 20% restocking ($60.00) fee has been deducted! What a ripoff...I regret having dine business with Garage Intel and feel misled by the company."
5,Liftmaster 3800 is a great product,"I purchased the LiftMaster 3800 for my new garage. I have 10' wide by 9' tall doors with a 13' ceiling and a door track that is about 12' high. I didn't want to add the extra door panels on the inside of the garage, so this LiftMaster was the best option. I'm very satisfied with the openers so far. They are smooth and quiet (although when the motor first starts turning there is a bit of a grunt and hum). I was planning on installing these myself, but then I found out that would void the warranty on my new doors - so I had the openers installed by the same company that installed my doors. The only feature missing that would be a nice to have is the compatibility with the internet gateway to be able to control the doors remotely and see open/close status on a phone app."
4,The True Story of Killing Pablo,A wonderful documentary. I read the book prior to watching the DVD and niether disappointed! Highly recommended for all who have an interest in this subject.
4,ultimate bread machine cookbook,"it's ok, big & heavy. lots of details, measurement conversions to american.don't know whether i'd order it if i'd seen it first.have another bread book i like more. wanted some different recipes."
3,"GOOD, BUT NO CIGAR","ALTHOUGH THESE ARE 95% POLICE/SHERIFF RECOLLECTIONS, IT ALL POINTS TO A ""LONE NUT THEORY."" I BELEIVE THAT IF THE DOCTORS AT PARKLAND HOSPITAL, JEAN HILL AND MANY OTHER CIVILLANS THAT WERE NOT INTERVIEWED,HAD BEEN, THE TONE OF THE BOOK WOULD HAVE CHANGED GREATLY. I ENJOYED READING IT AND ABSORBING ALL THE BACK PEDALING THE DALLAS POLICE DID DENYING THAT THEY KNEW JACK RUBY. HOWEVER, ALL THE BOOK POINTS OUT IS HOW EACH PERSON REMEMBERED AND INTEREPETED 11/22/63 IN THEIR OWN MIND."
1,Terrible,This was the biggest waste of money. This just sucks. Basically most of the bands you cant even understand what they are saying. Theres maybe two tracks that are decent and thats it. Please do not buy this unless you like that headbangers and yell so loud that you puke stuff. Not guns n roses at all.
4,I'll Call You in Kathmandu,"For several years, I covered the climbing scene in Utah, where I kept hearing references to an elderly woman, Elizabeth Hawley, who lived in Kathmandu, and knew everything about Himalayan climbing. I always wondered who Hawley was and how she got to Nepal.Now I know. This book follows the path that took Hawley to Kathmandu and explores the life she created there. Hawley is what I'd call a dame: irascible, snobby, sometimes rude, but also smart, unconventional and in charge of her own life. Bernadatte McDonald did a great job of capturing this woman, without sugar-coating her or offering apologies."
5,Much better than drug store products,"I used to use Lectric Shave but I have always hated the smell. This product works just as well and has a mild, pleasant odor. It is worth the extra money to not smell like I douched my head with a used car salesman's cologne."
5,Wonderful Product!,"I was in the process of transitioning from blade shaving to electric shaving using a Norelco Arcitec razor. I figured that it would be best to have a good electric pre-shave and after shave to make the process as painless as possible. Even though both these products are quite pricey, I took a chance and ordered them. I have not been disappointed in the least and they have been worth every penny. Along those lines, you don't have to use much of either so they go a very long ways! I found that if I didn't use the California North pre-shave that my skin tended to feel like it had been burned/irritated. Not so with the California North! (And the after shave is so incredibly soothing!) They are simply wonderful products!"
2,Like sitting on a piece of paper,"I bought this cushion for use on my wheel chair to reduce the hard feeling so common with long periods of inactivity. The delivery time was great, the cushion looks good, but after sitting on it for about 10 minutes the cushion is worthless. It needs additional firmness for some support. It does puff back up after you get up, but for actual cushion confort you are better off getting any kind of cushion, even cotton balls."
2,Not a Helmet Camera Kit!,This is simply a security camera. It has no mic or battery pack! Useless as a helmet type camera setup.
5,A young magician falls in love and falls back in TIME!,"A Young magician falls in love with the supreme Magus Rex's lovely daughter against Magus's wishes. To dampen the boys ardor, he takes her back in time to the dark ages. Due to population and the psychic energy created by it; Its easy to go to the past, Much harder to get back!!! What wins love or power? Is there a sequel????"
5,Unforgettable,I also came to Amazon to see if they had a copy of this book. I have read this book so many times that some of the pages are starting to come out. I also would love to see a sequel to this book. If you have the opportunity to pick this book up I would highly recommend it. There are many points in the book where you can't help but laugh out loud at the predicaments that the protagonist gets himself in and out of in a short span of time.
1,This is an imposter of the the real Book of Mormon.,"If you want a real Book of Mormon (Another Testament of Jesus Christ), just look up the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in the phone book, and they'll send you one for free. The book they're trying to sell here is not authorized except by the group that is trying to swindle you out of your money. It's like that clothes label that said U.S.A and turned out to be an island with the same initials."
1,A very dull book,"I was born and raised a ""Mormon"", and I know whereof I speak. I have read this book through and through 6 different times in my life, snippets on a daily basis for many years. It is a fairy tale, plain and simple. Not only that, but it is the most tedious, exhausting book you will ever pick up. Guaranteed to anesthetize and lobotomize. Read it at your own risk. :-/"
5,Read it yourself,"I don't know where slz7m@cc.usu.edu got her information, but it wasn't from reading the book. There is nothing in the book about Catholisizm. If there is, you'd have to ""dream"" it between the lines. It is no more racist than the Bible. It is simply a narration of two+ tribes over many generations struggling towards perfection. Christ is the central core. Whether it's God's Word is left up to the reader; for someone to make that decision for another reader is presumptious"
1,GET THE REAL BOOK OF MORMON FOR FREE,"This is not an authorized version of The Book of Mormon-Another Testament of Jesus Christ. You can get a free copy of the REAL Book of Mormon simply by logging onto the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints' website or looking up the local missionaries in your own town. No obligation is involved, but I believe once you read this translated ancient scripture, you will want to know more. Don't believe what you hear about the LDS church from NON members; find out for yourself what it is all about. Go to the real and accurate source: the Church itself. Then decide for yourself."
3,Go to the source,"Regardless of your religious views -- if any -- the serious student of religion or mormonism should have a copy of the original. The formatting isn't ""bible-like"" as in current editions nor are later changes in chapter order and other ""corrections/improvements"" made. This is just the way it first came out.If you are interested in Americana or revealed religions, this copy is essential for your library. There are other versions of the original available -- including electronic. But you should have at least one copy of the original without the intended distractions of giving it the ""look and feel"" of a bible.-Mike"
2,"Good book, bad formatting","For the record, I am a faithful Latter-day Saint with a great love for the Book of Mormon. I have no problem with the actual content, but this particular ebook version was a disappointment. The verses are double spaced and in courier, so that only one or two verses show up on each page. The chapters lack hard returns, and the table of content only links to the beginning of the various books, so that to get to 2 Nephi 15, you would have to manually scroll through several hundred pages. However, I can't complain about the price, so overall I'd give it two stars."
5,best book I have ever read,"The Book of Mormon is scripture,it is another testament of Jesus Christ. It is antiquitity. It was translated by Joseph Smith in a period of less than 90 days. Compare this to the time it took the King James scholars to complete the Bible.Even though the book gives authorship to Joseph Smith, this is not correct.This book is unique in all the world. There is not another like it, I challenge the reader of this review to pick it up and read it. I have a testimony, a personal conviction that it is the Word of God, that it was prepared and saved for us to read, and ponder and pray about. It is full of faith."
5,The Book of Mormon,"his book, the Book of Mormon, is the second Stick that was to joined together with the stick of Judah to become one in God's hand to be taken to every kindred, tounge, and nation, to establish His Word in all the world, by which it will be judged in the Last Day."
3,"good sound, but uncomfortable on my bigger ears.","I got a pair of these headphones with my RCA MP3 player, and they work ok. My biggest thing is that after about 30 minutes on, the way they clip to the ear, the edge of my ear feels sore, but also they irrirate just behind my ears where they rest, so they get uncomfortable. So, they are ok, but they do have other models available of hear bud size headphones that clip into the ear that are more comfortable on my ears. you just have to try them if you can before you buy them."
4,Entertaining!,"I must say that I was glad that I bought this DVD, this movie because I would have never guessed that Fred Durst played a part that didn't even resemble himself, I loved it and of course there was was Michael Beach which I had the pleasure of meeting at the Harley Davidson dealership in Van Nuys, California, cool guy and someone I know personally Dean Delray who sold me my Fatboy motorcycle, did a great job of acting in this movie. This movie was funny, entertaining and in more simple words goofy, but in a good way, I enjoyed it and dragged my boyfriend to watch it and he laughed and couldn't figure out what part Fred Durst played as he had the pleasure of meeting and riding with as well as Michael Beach and Dean. We loved the movie so much we ordered and anyone who watches it will find it funny in parts and goofy as well. A great laugh!"
3,good and a half,"I first got into Azita when i heardLife on the Fly. It is like Carol King meets Steely Dan meets that gas huffing chick you befriend,This album is good, but not quite up there with that gem: for whatever reason, she has toned the music down, and the tracks here don't have that flying magic drive.You can't blame this genius for wanting to make more nuanced music, and yes; all the chords and instrumental dynamics make it all work here. But this album could use a cooker or two to bring this simmering album on home"
3,"It works, but is a little lacking.","I'm about to pull these out of my car audio installation and replace them with another brand of ground loop isolators for two reasons.1.) I have found that they create a slight buzz with my installation. In researching other similar installations it appears that I need a to ground the units, but these units don't have a separate ground.2.) Its difficult to tell in the picture, but these units are HUGE. In my car audio install I need two of these, one for the front audio channels and one for the rear. Its very difficult to fit them behind the dash. As it stands my head unit sticks out from my dash a little bit because there just isn't enough space back there. I think one of the squarer and flatter ones would fit a lot easier."
4,More than I expected.,"James Dean might be America's least understood icon. His career was cut short and the success he saw alive was even more so; nonetheless he continues to influence pop culture to this day. I read this book because I was interested in the man behind the myth. The author, William Bast, delivers respectful insight to the life and early career of his friend. Recommended for anyone interested in a study of the actor, or for a wonderful read. William Bast brings you back to the days of James Dean's college days and early struggles in theater and television; the burgeoning of the young stars success, and the haunting circumstances surrounding his untimely death."
2,Bast's memory after 53 years,"Unfortunately this biography often irritated me immensely. I cannot even remember what I had for dinner yesterday, yet Mr Bast after 53 years seems to have an astounding memory of exactly what happened, just quoting a few examples from this book:As Jimmy wiped his plate clean of egg yolk with bread ... (page 116)I was still trying to sort this all out, when a stocky, older guy with nervous sweat dotting his upper lip sidled up ... (page 136)Jimmy sat on a bench in the shade of the station and stared over the vast expanse of shimmering sands, his expression serious, his mind obviously churning. (page 180)What a memory!"
2,Jittery jams,"2 1/2These psychedelic tunes are usually far from dull thanks to an emphasis on freakout sax and aggressive female vocals, but often comes across too rough around the edges."
2,opinion,"Book was not of historical quaility. Was likely a work aimed at jr. high school students. It is a brief outline of his life with likely imagined conversations.I was aware this was a ""copied"" out of print book and the result was not too bad."
2,booooring!!!!,"This is just an art appreciation lecture on disc. I guess art lovers without access to museums or art historians' work would need something like this. However, live art lectures have a question-and-answer format that makes them interactive and fun. This work was just dull. The disc does a good job in mentioning that Matisse worked in several styles. Still, it's just one piece after another. Nothing moves on the entire disc, making everything feel so static and overly two-dimensional. This disc leaves many questions to be answered. For example, they show a painting of Madame Matisse and never once mentioned when the Matisses got married. They mention a series of dancing female nudes and then a picture of male musicians. They never say anything about the men being airbrushed or the obvious Japonisme influence on the piece. Though an average-length documentary, it feels like an eternity due to the dullness of the work. Blah! and yawn!"
3,One Hour of Matisse's Paintings,"That's what this DVD comes down to, 56 minutes of watching Matisse's paintings click by in chronological order. If you are a fan of Matisse, buy it. If you aren't, netflix it. This DVD is simply a slide show with narration. The narration leaves much to be desired, as it is very monotone. The biggest drawback is that you don't know which of the paintings are going to be talked about in detail or just have their titles given. If you are looking for a deep study or understanding of Matisse's oeuvre, you should keep looking. This DVD is more along the lines of an undergrad paper."
2,bad fit,"Typically I am satisfied with Scosche products, but this time was very disappointing. The area for the actual stereo to go in is to small, I ended up using my roto tool to cut-out/sand down an opening big enough for the stereo. I got a normal sized radio, nothing fancy at all. But needless to say it doesn't look clean and smooth. Also, the whole console area is pretty much just a snap in place type of deal, and it doesn't snap in very well at all. I got it in place and it doesn't sit flush at all. Pretty disappointed, but it's not worth trying over."
5,Kevin's Reviews,These headphones are very comfortable. If you don't like sticking something in your ear canal then this is the way to go. Excellent sound and easy to use. Charges quickly. You can also use the 3.5mm plug and wire them to your Mp3 player or phone. They look good too.
3,The one I bought was defective,"I've heard and I believe that this product would have been a wonderful new product. The one I received was defective. I returned it and received a full refund, thank you seller! I decided to buy another connector to my old headphones and they still work wonderfully for me."
2,Is it really Kona?,"I don't know about this coffee company! This coffee just tastes like OK coffee to me. I'd much rather have 8 O'Clock Colombian coffee that costs about 1/3 of this (whatever it is).BTW, I love Kona and Kau coffee, but this just doesn't measure up."
2,"Decent coffee, but simply did not smell or taste like Kona","The package had a ""use by"" date of July 2, 2011, which means a roast date of over a year ago. By comparison, the Lavazza beans which arrived the same day had a use-by date of 6-15-12. While it may simply be a freshness issue, it tasted like the many knock-off ""kona's"" you find at Sam's Club or BJ's, and not worth the price. Would not recommend."
3,Just Ok! Don't waste your money!,I couldn't wait to get this coffee. Very expensive but wanted to treat myself to the best.I was however very dissappointed and will never buy this again! I thought it was bitter and no better than the other bland coffee I have purchased! Save your money.
2,Highly Disappointed,"I bought five pounds of this coffee for Christmas presents based on its awesome reviews and an incredible sale at the time. I kept one bag for myself as I am also a coffee fanatic and I was horrified by its poor quality. The beans were very light and EXTREMELY DRY - there was absolutely no ""oil"" on the beans at all. Tried to alter the amount of coffee I used with each new brew in an attempt to improve the taste but remained bitter. I am so embarrassed that I gave this coffee as gifts - my friends probably think I got it for $5 a pound! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!However I must say that seller itself was good and beans were shipped via priority mail directly from Hawaii."
2,Not the Value it Claims to be...,"I tried three bags of this product but have been surprised by how consistently dry the beans are in each shipment. It is the messiest bean I have ever ground. The quality of the coffee is not on par with less expensive beans purchased at the grocer. The taste is okay but it doesn't rise to the level that you should expect. Royal Kona at Wal-Mart, believe it or not, is a better product. I am really disappointed because I like the convenience of the Amazon subscription service. But, the product doesn't measure up."
2,Disappointed,"I have been to Hawaii several times and have had Kona coffee. This was a complete letdown. It is nowhere near what I experienced in Hawaii: the aroma, the taste, distinct flavor. This one tasted no better and perhaps a tad worse than what I purchase at Costco for a fraction of the price. I was looking forward to enjoying it but was sadly disappointed. Coffee is okay but not for the price."
2,This used to be a 16 ounces bag for the same price,"I like that coffee. It's expensive, but I like it. I was about to reorder, but noticed that although the price hadn't changed since three months ago, this was now a 14 ounces instead of 16 ounces bag.I find this change highly deceptive. If you want to raise the price, raise the price. But this is borderline insulting."
1,Not happy with the freshness and flavor,"I am really surprised that this coffee wasn't better. I have been to Hawaii and thoroughly enjoyed Kona coffee, so I thought I would treat myself. Eight O'Clock coffee from the grocery store tastes just as good for a third of the price."
5,Great kona,My wife and I have traveled to Hawaii and prushased coffee several times. This coffee came as fresh as that we purchase in Kona and was competitively priced.
3,Not as good as expected,"This product is a pretty DECENT product. I was expecting a much better cup of coffee. I purchased this along with ""Cafe Altura Organic Peruvian Dark"" and the other coffee was much better. In fact it was also a 1/3rd of the price. If I did a blind taste test I think the majority of the participants would select the peruvian dark."
1,Kona Coffee; you've got to be joking!,I am a big sucker for coffee; especially Kona and I try to to taste every brand I get. Hawaii Roasters is absolutely the worst I have tasted so far (Just in case you are wondering my favorite is Koa Peaberry). This one doesn't have even the slightest characteristics of Kona Coffee. If you don't want to spend a small fortune on good coffee; just go with blended Kona. You will save some money over this brand yet still will get a better taste.
2,well not so good,the adhesive side of the velcro thingus UN adhesiviated from the car wher i had stuck it and was dangling by a spider web strand when i checked it. ALSO the new fat kind of key did not fit into it so good.
4,Worked fine for me,"The instructions was A littel sparse. I have windows XP so I guessed of I might should do. It said to connect the adio cableto the sound card, but it is built in the system, so I left that step out and it worked! Great then I installed the software and it worked great. This is the first time I viewed A DVD and I loved it"
3,Not as appears,Price & shipping reasonable. However the filter fiber was yellow in color instead of white. At this time I do not know if this filter will hold up like the white one.
2,"love the song, but the book doesn't sound good","I have known this song for 20+ years. The rabbit gets turned into a goon- moral: hare today goon tomorrow. My young children love the song even if they don't understand the adult twist to the moral. And they love acting it out. I think bopping with your hand is less offensive than using a large hammer! They also love the suspense of ""Down came the gooooood fairy"".After reading all the reviews of this book I think I'm NOT going to ruin the magic of this song by getting this book."
2,"Nice pictures, but nothing new to add","If you are buying this book for an ""insiders"" view on the Beatles tour, you will be very disappointed. Mostly this is rehash of newspaper articles and fan rememberances. It is not a bad book, just rather innocuous. The most inside information shared is the brand of cigarettes George Harrison smoked. If you are a Beatle novice you will enjoy this book, but there is nothing new for long time fans."
1,"Looks good, musically awful","Bought one of these for our 8 year old for Christmas. It's nearly impossible to get it into tune by an experienced guitar player. After an hour's work, it got in tune but the tone is dull. And it won't keep a tune longer than about 2 chords. If you want a prop, there are far cheaper options, if you want something that your child can make music with, this isn't it."
4,I may be getting old,"Back in the early 1970s, Chess Records sent all of their major recording artists over to London to record. Muddy Waters was no exception to this gimmick. Muddy works here with a mixture of some of his regular band members and some young British rockers. The results are good, if not essential. Muddy had recorded most of these songs before, in superior versions. Not that these versions are bad, they are just lacking when compared to the original versions. Most of the songs here are given a more ""contemporary"" (circa 1970) feel to them, with mixed results. This is a pretty good album, but I would recommend starting with Muddy's older, ""classic"" material before you work your way up to this one."
3,"Good story, poor editing","Blind Luck was an entertaining story, but the errors -- grammar, spelling, usage, punctuation, etc. -- made it a difficult read. I also found the description of the characters as ""a group of yuppies"" to be highly inaccurate. ""Beer-guzzling, unemployed 20-somethings"" would have been more accurate. The book proves that anyone with a decent imagination can get a book published, regardless of their writing skill. It also proves that any company with a word-processor could call itself a publisher, regardless of their knowledge of grammar, usage, punctuation, etc. While I understand that most books contain a few errors, it was very distressing to me that I could have used a red pen to make corrections on every other page -- at least! I found the story to be entertaining, and if the types of errors mentioned above don't bother you, you'll like it too!"
5,"ACTUALLY, I GIVE THIS BOOK 10 STARS!!","Yes, that other reader is right!! This book will change your life - or rather, the life of your hair. Great, amazing, TRUE advice. Get the products he recommends, follow the plan, and see and feel the difference in 2 weeks. That's what happened to me. I wish I'd read this book at least 20 years ago. GET THIS BOOK!!!!!"
4,Beautiful Black Hair,"Where was Shamboosie when I was a teenager and destroying my hair?! This is the BEST hair care book I have ever read. Anyone who uses no-lye relaxers should read it and learn.I have seen a great improvement in my hair since I started following Shamboosie's advice. My mother has been experiencing hair loss, so I loaned her the book.My only complaint is the products recommended are not easy to find in the area that I live in, so I have to order them online."
1,Don't buy into the hype on this book!,"When I read I started reading the reviews for this book, I had high hopes. Those hopes were soon dashed, however, when I started reading. I have read several books on the topic of black hair care, and this has to be one of the worst. It didn't tell me anything new (what I understood of it). It was so vague. For instance, he would say something along the lines of make sure you use a good conditioner. Okay..but what makes a good conditioner? Another thing, he only suggest Nexxus and Dudley products (Does he work for them?). Another thing, he seems to have something personal against no-lye relaxers. Every other page was a warning against using them. Keep your money people!"
1,Not too good,This book is just not informative. I am not trying to be ugly but I beleive black women really need to be more informed about hair care than this. I dont think it is purposely done. I truly am not sure if he really knows some of the problems about our black hair.This is really close to my heart and I feel compelled to speak out. Get Cathy Hose or Carolyn Gray they have valuable info about taking care of our hair and tips to start a healthy regimen. Sometimes you have to change to get good results and I am proof.
2,Very disappointed,"I'm not sure what others who reviewed this DVD saw. Were we watching the same monologues? I'm very disappointed in this purchase. I was looking for innovation, creativity and technical skill among contemporary artists and perhaps some gems of wisdom they can share with the rest of us. I've taught art for thirty years, inspiring others to consider art as a career. If many of these people were my students, their ""work"" would have received poor critiques. Most of the artists in ""Art: 21"" have very distorted viewpoints and incomprehensible verbal and graphic communication skills. Many appear psychologically troubled. Few have the technical and observational skills one associates with great art. The exception is Josiah McElheny who demonstrates in clear terms a reverence for the past and a vision for the present and future. Do not waste your money on this DVD."
2,Terrible design for toddlers,"Aside from the previously mentioned BPA problem and the problems with the spout not aligning properly, I don't know how a company that designs so many baby products cannot create one that is more practical for a toddler. My son drops his cup quite frequently and the valve pops out almost every time, leaving me to fish it out of whatever he's drinking. Moreover, if I don't notice the valve has fallen out, then I've got a trail of juice following my son to clean up."
1,flawed design,"When the lid is tightened, the spout is over one handle, not in between the handles. There is no way to adjust it so the child can actually hold the cup with two hands and drink. A waste of money."
2,"Valve piece falls out easily, allowing everything to free-flow out of spout","When this cup is dropped or banged on the floor the valve piece falls into the cup, allowing the cup's contents to free-flow out. Very messy! The valve is just slightly too small and it doesn't take much to jar it out"
3,I just can't get into this series,"I can't put my finger on what bothers me about these books. Maybe it's the Christian references. None of the book reviews I read when purchasing several of these books mentioned that there was stuff about what god wants and what Christians should do. This just doesn't sit well with me. Some of the info is ok but most of the books go to far or off the target subject.They don't seem to appeal to my boy either. So we rarely even read them after the first time. He never asks for any of them to be read again. That says something important, don't you think? There are better ""get along"" books."
5,show me someone who can touch this man,"I just saw Supernat live yesterday at Lollapalooza. [BEST] EVER!!!! This man is a genius, he went through the crowd and was freestylin' about the stuff we had in our pockets! No one can touch this man, NOBODY!!!"
4,Good realistic view of war,As a returned Iraq war vet I can tell you this is a good glimpse of what war is like. A good addition to any vets library.
4,All a kid wants,This sationary kit is all kids want espesially when you're a Harry Potter fan. You could spend all day writing letters to your friends and decorating your letters . This stationary kit is what every kid wants to get there hands on.
4,All a kid wants,This sationary kit is all kids want espesially when you're a Harry Potter fan. You could spend all day writing letters to your friends and decorating your letters . The only thing is it is too expensive with some exchange rates never the less it is a fun filled pack that every kid wants to get there hans on.
5,Inspirational!,"As an established commercial airbrush artist, just beginning to dabble in watercolor fine art I found ""Splash 6"" very inspiring. It has opened my eyes to the amazing potential of watercolors and I highly recommend this book to fellow artists and lovers of fine art."
3,Specialist book,"This is a very nice book, that teaches you to make French pastry-chef quality letters and borders to decorate your cakes. It has extensive examples and instructions for modelling animals and flowers in marzipan. It also has a gallery of special delicious looking cakes, unfortunately though, if you want to try those, you are referred to the author's other volumes for the recipes."
5,Entertaining and socially needed,"The girls are absolutely right. Nude is what it all should be. Clothes are just a barrier to freedom, honesty, fun, and knowing each other. The tape is GREAT! These girls are terrific!! I wish they lived in my town. I watched this while my girlfriend was away on business. They really helped get me through the lonely night. I give a VERY stiff endorsement."
5,Tries to be interesting,This school book tries to be interesting. I dont find english and essay writing to be that interesting but at least it is not as boring as most text books.
3,Good...,"I think this item is pretty good. Even tho it is for an English class in college. I think it's really helpful, giving a lot of an examples of actual writings from ordinary people."
1,"OMG, I thought Dracula 3000 was dumb... new winner now!","I am of the type who enjoys the cheesy b-movies. For the most part many are well made and at least TRY to be entertaining and I give them that. However, there are those films which turn even my (hardened) stomach. I thought Dracula 3000 was the worst, until I saw this film.Pros: A few cute actressesCons: 99.9% of the film.-Bad acting, people don't know how to enunciate their words to make them seem believable.-No discernible plot-Plot holes-Dumb lines-Pointless lines-Dumb and pointless lines-etc etc.Whatever possessed anyone to create this drivel, under who knows how many varying titles, should be shot.I suppose their aim was to waste a few hours of our time, if so, they succeeded. AVOID THIS MOVIE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!! I mean it!"
2,OK but not what I was looking for,"This has good stuff in it, but not what I was looking for.Very technical, if that is what you are into."
2,Get a Chinese Chef's cleaver instead,"I bought these to help me with my food and my dog's food too. Yes, it will cut through flesh that's not to thick or to tough, but so will most of my basic kitchen knifes. I am amazed at how badly these don't work. These shears are also not comfortable to hold.Save yourself some trouble and get a Chinese Chef's cleaver instead."
5,give it a try,This is a fresh and strong funk CD. If you like funky tunes you can not leave this one aside.
4,"You only get ONE bulb, not the four that are pictured.",I would ask that this company provide a picture of exactly what is being sold. I thought at first they were selling a package of four bulbs because the picture shows four bulbs of different colors.
1,Don't take a risk,"I saw many bad reviews for this recorder but for the price of $76, the cheapest I could find at this time so I purchased it. The remote was not working and could not set up or program. I could open and close the tray from the recorder without the try but nothing else. Had to return to amazon. No wonder the price is getting cheaper but it will not be worth to try this recorder."
1,Very negative look at motherhood,"As a twenty-something considering motherhood, I thought this book would encourage and support. Instead it made me terrified to ever have a child! The testimonials from real life moms were terrible! They all sounded selfish and spoiled by complaining that a baby took up too much of their time. Every person has negative stories to share about an experience, but this author did not seem to dig too hard to show positives, too."
2,"Gonna Let it Shine, A Concert for the Holidays, by Odetta","I love her voice, but this particular CD is a little loose, being recordedat a concert. I enjoyed her holiday CD of Spirituals much more and many of the songs are the same, but the Spirituals CD is much smoother."
2,"This book left me saying, 'What?'","I picked this book up at the checkout line at a local bookstore. The plot summary on the back cover interested me and I assumed I would enjoy the book. I finished the book fairly quickly and when I was done, I just didn't feel like I had actually read a complete story. The entire book seemed kind of dis-jointed and it's pacing felt out of place.I have a tought time saying this was a bad book, but I do know that I'll never recommend it to anyone."
2,Move on,"I'm glad Deaver finished this trilogy and has moved on to better things.Of the three books about Rune, this is easily the worst. Although the bulk of the book is a good story, the ending (last chapter or two) are ridiculous - multiple plot reverses, character revelations out of the blue, lengthy explanations bringing in all kinds of new information, hackneyed dialog, and on and on. The finaly 30 pages contained a lot of the frenzy of the final scene of the play/movie ""Clue"" but it wasn't meant to be funny or satire, and definitely wasn't clever.I got the idea that Deaver wrote himself into a corner and also ran out of time to finish the book.I'll give it two stars for the mainly interesting plot and story, up to a point.Try other Deaver books. He has done a lot better than this one."
3,This book is a mixed bag,"The story in this book is very interesting, and moves very well, until the last part. The descriptions are good, the dialogue is good, and the writing just flows. That can't be an accident or a one time lucky thing.I cannot understand why a superb writer like this gets tired of his own book before it's finished. There must have been a deadline that was too short or something of the sort. At a certain stage of the action, and I mean right in the middle of some action, there suddenly comes a spate of explanations from one ""goodguy"" character who's holding a gun on two ""badguy"" characters, with the main character in the room also. Background and past actions are quickly described by this savior as if in a hurried summary. He's just doing a monologue, it seems. I don't think that would happen in real life. It was very distracting in a book I was really enjoying.I hope to try another Deaver book, because I believe he's a good writer. I hope."
3,The best of the Rune novels.,"This last novel was the best out of the other three with Rune.Rune is more mature and has a much better job this time.Thestoryline kept my interest, but was far from reality (in my opinion),which gave the novel a downside."
3,Happy with my Purchase,I right allot of lecture notes and want a simple printer to print them and this does the job perfectly
1,very bad,"I didn't receive my order and they didn't care, besides being overpriced was a horrible experience!"
3,Broken,"I ordered this for my mom for christmas, when she opened it one of the angels wings was broken and we had to glue it back on"
3,"adds color, no real taste","I don't know if there is any nutritional advantage for adding pumpkin to your food, but this product doesn't really have much flavor at all. Any ""pumpkin"" flavor we generally associate with fall foods comes from the nutmeg and cinnamon spices. This gives a nice color to things like pumpkin mousse and pudding, but there's not much flavor advantage."
2,No nutrition facts on product,"Pretty sure Serving Size, Calories, Total Fat, etc. is a label requirement. This has absolutely none of that completed on the label. It is only a flavoring - maybe that's why?"
1,Not worth the money,This frame was cheap and not worth the $35 I paid for it. It was poorly made (chipped in multiple spots) The frame and glass dont even line up. Piece of junk!!
1,You get what you pay for,Next time I would pay a little more and get a better product. These are good for the money but are thin and the handles are cheap wood.
5,Cheaper than a new tube,"These patches work great for fixing punctured tubes. They are not ""emergency"" patches like some others, but are permanent and take a few more minutes than the emergency style. Whenever I get a flat on the road, I put in my spare tube, bring my punctured tube home, patch it up with one of these patches, and then use that as my new spare. I've got tubes with three or four of these patches on them. (Once they get to that point however, I usually throw them away.)"
4,OK for small punctures,"I got this kit in order to try to repair an old bike tire that had developed a leak. It turned out that the puncture hole on my inner tube was located on a seam, and when I tried to sand the surrounding area the hole got even bigger. I think that the sand paper that comes with this kit is a bit too coarse, and I would recommend that you get yourself a bit less coarse sand paper in order to get the job done. The enlarged hole on my inner tube was still patchable, but barely. In the end I had decided that it might be better just to buy a new inner tube. These are fairly inexpensive, and you can get a brand new one for just slightly more than the price of this kit. It's still a fairly good kit, and it would be a good thing to have on you in an emergency."
4,Great Kit!,"I had to use this the other day when my rear tire got a leak, worked like a charm and held pressure. Would have been nice to have a few more patches though."
5,great product,"I just got a new bike, and the tires are an odd size, so tubes are more expensive. I typically have 1-2 flats per month (riding 300-400 mi/month), so the tubes were beginning to put a crimp in my meager biking budget.I've tried the green slime skabs pre-glued patches, but they never lasted very long. A couple of weeks ago, I patched a tube with this Park kit, and it is still holding pressure. These are high pressure tires, too (100 psi). In addition, the hole was right next to the ""ridge"" that runs down the middle of the tube. The pre-glued patches would never work at this location, but, of course, most of the holes are there.I'm hoping to never have to buy a tube again (or until the entire surface of the tube is patched)."
5,I've Said It Before...,"I've said it all before, I'm always amazed by her consistently great CDs, and how often they end up in the player. Great voice, great songs, and if you're a player, she will have you grabbing for your guitar to play along."
5,Delightful,"""The Hobbit"" has to be one of my favourite books of all time (next to the ""Lord of the Rings"" series). It depicts the tale of a young (well, young for a hobbit which is about 50) hobbit which by chance becomes involved in an adventure, which is very un-hobbit like. And though Bilbo Baggins (the hobbit) complains endlessly and wishes to be back in his nice warm hobbit hole, he has the time of his life (well, maybe not the whole time) and forges strong friendships with elves, dwarves, men and wizards. Artfully written, it is a delightful tale which I will undoubtedly end up reading again and again."
2,Beware - this edition is NOT The Hobbit,"This edition by Patricia Gray is a play based on The Hobbit by Tolkien. Do not buy this book thinking you are getting Tolkien's great book. As a play, it is O.K., but if you are looking for Tolkien's novel, The Hobbit, try another edition."
4,An ok book,The Hobbit was an exciting book to read and I would recommend it. It has a very good plot to it and great character names. Although it has some bad things it describes the surrounding of where Bilbo the main character is. A thing I liked best from this book was the characters names. The fighting scenes are great epically the one where there are 5 wars going on at once. I like when Bilbo finds the ring in the dark from Gollom a creature you'll find at about in the book. I think this is a wonderful book for anyone.
3,Ideal Coax Tool,Nice Tool but it can be purchased at Lowe's for less than $15.00. You could also check other home stores for pricing.
5,All you need to learn Sockets,"I didn't even know what a socket was before I got this book. Less than a week later I have successfully completed several programs for my employer that use sockets to communicate. This book is written for Unix, but with the supplemental Windows programs at the MKP website I was able to write programs in a Windows environment with ease. This book is clear and concise and contains all the information you need at a price that is at least three times less than that of other books I have seen. I would certainly recommend it to anyone trying to learn sockets."
3,"An ok book, basic coverage on the subject","This book is a good introduction to programming sockets in C. The presentation is UNIX/POSIX based but is fine for Windows programmers who wanting to get an introduction to TCP/IP programming. This is a practical guide that gets to the point, theory and TCP/IP design underpinnings are left to other books. Don't expect to much from this book it is short, 130 pages, and 20 of that is an API reference. It's ok for those simply interested in the subject or if used as a primer before reading something more substantive on the subject. A more complete book on the subject is ""Network Programming for Windows"" by Jones and Ohlund."
3,Don't be fooled...,"...this is NOT Pocket-sized. The book is about 9in. x 6in., and would only fit in the pockets of a giant. I wanted something 1. portable and 2. a good desk reference for TCP/IP sockets. This book fits nicely into the second category if not the former. It has a reasonable index, and is organized nicely to quickly find information. Why on earth it's called the ""Pocket Guide"" is beyond me."
5,Cool Book,"very cool book, great for making typical fireworksgreat for the 4th, im using it for July4th '08!!!"
1,Just a soft piece of sponge,"I bought this item on the basis of its name thinking that it could give my coccyx pain some relief, it was also based on the fact that it had a high level of satisfaction from persons who bought it. When i got the item i thought what a RIP OFF. How could you enclose ordinary sponge inside a cotton sleeve and call it a medical device and charge more than 15$ for it!! How is a silly product like this going to relieve any pain or stress.Conclusion - dont trust reviews - it could be written by fake reviewers."
1,SPONGE CAKE,"I gave the product one-star because it was worthless for me. I have a slipped disk in my lower back. I needed a product that would provide some relief while I ate, while I used my computer, and when I drove. I also weigh 195 pounds at 6 feet tall. This product provided me no relief whatsoever. Although it had the traditional wedge shape and an adequate cover, the foam inside the cover was like sponge cake. It immediately sank under my weight and compressed completely. At least it rebounded nicely when I stood up. This cushion might be of some comfort if the buyer was 120 pounds or less in weight, but not for guys like me. Wouldn""t it be nice if sellers were required to do tests with real people and provide compression figures at different weights?"
2,Not for people over 200lbs.,"If you weigh over 200lbs, the cushion compresses too far to be of much use. I would suggest that you choose a different cushion if you weigh over 200lbs."
2,compresses easily,"This cushion compresses really easily. When sitting on it, the cushion is only an inch thick."
2,Thickness,This pad is not thick enough for a good support to the tail bone area so I would recommend something thicker. Ok of short trips in the car.
2,Flat as a pancake is right!,I have to agree with the poster who said this pillow got flat as pancake. I need to sit for hours at my computer for work and I did not notice any real difference. What did help is the big fluffy pillow off my bed that I got on sale from Kohl's. This pillow really does get flat as a pancake when you sit on it.
4,cushion,Good product and was just what I needed. Sloping design is great and doesn't put pressure on you legs.
3,Alive! Reprise is missing,"I bought this book, expecting to see both parts of ""Alive!"" in it. For those of you who have the Concept Cast recording, it's the second half of the song, for those with the Broadway cast, it's a few tracks later. In any case, the reprise is much more dramatic, difficult, and impressive, and some of the music is different. Boo to Cherry Lane Music for dumbing this down."
5,Recovery Champ,"I have used this product twice now and both times it has surpassed my expectations.. No other product works, and then, BAM! this one works, sees the drive and mounts it, sees all the files... It's a beautiful thing- thank you Prosoft-"
5,Excellent Introduction,"This book has been invaluable to my American Politics studies at University. I was relatively knew to American Politics prior to my studies, and this book offers an introduction that is varied, and never bores the reader, and has allowed me to develop a keen knowledge and interest in the area."
2,A little like stale cotton candy,"Unlike a lot of people, I'm not ashamed to admit that I like pop music. I don't need some whiney brat lecturing me on war or the Rain forest every other song 'Cough' Coldplay 'Cough'. That said, I still can't say that I recommend this particular album.Like most people (At least in North America) I bought this CD solely on the strength of the impossible not to like title track 'Every time we touch'. If you really like that song, good news! The rest of the album is basically 'Every time we touch' recycled but none nearly as good as the original. It also contains remakes of songs that probably shouldn't have been recorded the first time around... 'Truly, madly, deeply' & 'Kids in America'... The last one is particularly odd since Cascada is European (Sneaky, tricky little Cascada!)All in all it's a little like stale cotton candy... It tastes OK, but dissolves quickly."
5,amazing,AMAZING CD!!!!Favorites:Everytime we touchEverytime we touch (candlelight)MiracleBad BoyHow do you do!
4,Just a few thoughts,"I purchased the self-titled Espers album a few weeks ago, and found myself in love with it from the first play. I had to have the Weed Tree. I won't bother typing a lot, since the guy above me seemed to have reviewed the album thoroughly. Espers really has a mature, enlightened aspect to their music. They seem to be very comfortable with their style, and they pull it off so well. I listen to them and can't help but feel like I'm sitting in a meadow, perhaps in times of knights and plagues. And no, I do not live-action-role-play. The music really pulls emotions from you, and never fails to transport you to another world.Favorite songs on this one? Black is the Color is amazingly peaceful. Or maybe I'm just a sucker for the man and woman harmonizing their vocals, because I also adore the cover of Flaming Telepath. Overall, you can't go wrong with this cd, unless you're expecting something adrenaline-logged. Think, smoke a cigarette, look out the window, and listen to Espers!!"
2,scentsless,"Did not like this at all!! wish I could have smelled it befor I bought it. live and learn i guess. I gave it to my brother, He liked it."
5,A must for Bronte and poetry lovers!,"The poems of Branwell Bronte offer a poignant look inside the unfairly overlooked, talented brother of the famous Bronte sisters. His earlier poems tell of the childhood games, plays, and fantasies that were an indelible influence on the later works of Anne, Emily and Charlotte. His later, sadder poems are arguably as fine as his sister Emily's. Well worth a look!"
1,Misses the Point!!,"This book is a complete waste of time, this just isn't the college experience. It feels like it was written 20 years ago."
3,Happy I paid < $4 for these,"Despite being the best of the trio of Erin Baker's products I purchased during a Warehouse sell-off, I fail to understand how or why anyone could justify paying over a dollar a piece for these things. Sure, the instructions are dead-on with the freeze-before-toasting method, but they have more ingredients than healthy cookies I can make at home for MUCH cheaper, and with superior texture and without the garbage. If you think these are healthy OR a good value, you've been duped."
3,breakfast cookie,"These do not taste that good to me, but I guess I could break off small pieces and use as dog treats."
4,Very filling,"These breakfast cookies come in handy when one does not have time to prepare and eat a hot, nutritious breakfast. They are very filling (sometimes I can't eat the whole cookie) and they taste fresh. Not a ""cookie"" in the traditional sense, so don't expect a sugary cookie treat."
2,Excellent and well written book on Rural Poverty,I found the book to be very informative and uself. I really enjoyed the fact that the writer clearly spelled out the floss and weakness of each government. He also talks about solutions that are very applicable and needed to fight poverty in the 21st century
5,"A magical, funny book to read aloud with someone you love.","Easily the best novel I've read in five years, I've read I Am One of You Forever over and over and over again. The friend, who introduced me to this book and Chappell's other writings, read I Am One of You Forever to me aloud. Chappell's books are meant to be spoken. Whether you read it to yourself or read it aloud to someone you love, I promise you that reading I Am One of You Forever will be one of life's more delightful experiences"
1,Problems with Kindle edition of a wonderful book,"This is a fabulous book by an author who is sadly underrated. However, the Kindle edition had chunks of text out of sequence. Buy the paperback. It will be a classic."
4,GPS Made Easy,"GPS Made Easy is a compelling, exciting and informative read for professional resource and infrastructure mappers, monitors and managers, as well as for lay readers. After her insightful and helpful book on Virtual Reality, Larijani again engages us with an accurate, clear, timely guide to a high-tech topic. She takes us on a delightful historical and practical journey, using everyday words and amusing sketches, and covers the practical applications in spades. She answers the questions (1) What is GPS? (2) How does it work? (3) What can it do? (4) What can't it yet do? And (5) What's being done to turn (4) into (3)? Once opened, it's a hard book to close until finished!"
3,Good assortment. Bad quality from China,"Good assortment of tools, bits and sockets. Bad quality tools from China. There are a lot of burs from the low quality Chinese steel. The ratchet function on the driver is okay - not very smooth though. The Screwdriver is very bulky and it does not swivel 360 degrees like you think it would from the picture. They should have just used a regular ratcheting screwdriver. This one does not add any more function with the tilt feature."
2,Not That Good.,My three year old son did not like this video. He normally likes singing and dancing shows. I don't think the black and white had much to do with my sons dislike. The film is just too out dated and boring.
3,Ehhhh Hardy is interesting,"Interesting set, TNA has always been hit or miss to me, and so is this set. Hardy is a very charismatic guy and that carries most of his matches into at least a rewatchable category. So I would say if you are a fan of Hardy's, a fan of TNA, or a person with unlimited disposable income, buy it."
4,Delicious Recipes and Clever Ideas,"As we all know, Martha can be a bit anal when it comes to many things, I have to admit I really like her cookbooks. The recipes are easy to follow and most of the time, tasty. The entertaining ideas are good, however, I've never been able to follow one completely as I simply don't have the time to do it all. Perhaps if I were a wealthy at-home wife I could...but in that case..wouldn't I have someone do it _for_ me?"
4,For silver jewelry,"I bought this to store with all my sterling jewelry - so far, it seems to be working as I have not had to clean any of the jewelry yet."
3,Whippet Cookies by Dare,"This is the second time I've ordered these cookies. The flavor is very good, and I cannot purchase these locally.I was a little disappointed because, both times it seems as though the box was stored or shipped in too much heat. All the cookies are stuck together, and the chocolate seemed a little old because it was whitish and grainy.I still enjoy them, but I just wish they looked like they do in the picture on the box."
1,"As a coffin builder, I cannot recommend this book.","The photographs in ""Do-It-Yourself Coffins"" are nicely done. Unfortunately, the artisanry and aesthetic appeal of the coffins are not. As a person who designs and builds fine, handcrafted coffins, I was disappointed in the level of how-to information presented as well as the quality and appearance of the finished products."
1,Zero Stars!,"I have built one of the coffins following the directions in the book. Some measurements are missing, and some are not correct. This cost me in materials and time. Beware!"
1,THE BOOK SHOULD BE BURIED IN THE COFFIN,"This book is a total waste of time and money. the title says ""coffins"" but it only offers one coffin to build (badly). For an alleged technical manual there are many, many things in the book that are just WRONG. The author invites you to rip a piece of plywood that is longer than the standard plywood length. The craftsmanship is horrendous with proudly displayed mitered joints that don't meet. I have the feeling that the guy who gave this book 5 stars is either related to the author or I can picture him trying to turn on his table saw through his straight jacket. Save your money this one is the pitts and a disgrace to be sold alongside serious woodwoorking books"
2,Outdated and very predictable humor,"I did not laugh, and what worse, I left this book before the end, something I really rarely do.This is NOT classic English humor. The comic situations are very basic and the dialogs not very witty. The effort to be funny is too obvious, and therefore ineffective."
5,Me Encanta,One of my favorite movies. Spanish movies are very hard to find. Here I was able to purchase and enjoy the movie!
3,Not bad,I know little about DareDevil but this was a pretty good book. It was action packed but most of the time action sometimes doesn't sound good on paper. What I didn't care for was the use of gd.
1,If I could give it no stars I would....HORRIBLE FOR HOUSE WITH STAIRS!,"I did a pretty dumb thing and let my husband pick out the vaccum cleaner for our newly built 2 story home. We have 4 kids ages 8, 7, 4 and 1 year old. I need something that I don't have to take apart to clean every week. I have enough that I have to do than clean a vaccum cleaner.I have read reviews where they state it works wonderfully with stairs. I find this NOT to be the case in my house. I can't stand it. It is heavy!! And it falls over. You always have to have a hand on it.I have a son that has severe Eczema and I wanted a vaccum with a bag. But my husband thought this one would be great. It is not. Dust flys everywhere.Within the next 6 months I am buying another vaccum cleaner and a separate handheld vaccum to clean my stairs.VERY DISSAPPOINTED!"
1,So terrible...,"I too have had this vacuum for about a year and at first, it worked well. Now it starts a high-piched whistling after 2 minutes, the brush almost never rolls and it doesn't pick up any of the dog hair from the carpet."
4,Bissell 3750 Lift-Off Bagless Vacuum,"Quiet and powerful - well engineered and very well built.The detachable canister feature works great (for stairs, etc)! This is what sold us on the 3750 model.Independent power switches for suction and beater-bar a great feature for cleaning (but not scratching) hardwood floors.In upright mode, rolls about easily and can get flat for access under couches and chairs.Filters work very well - no bypass dust.Only thing keeping me from assigning 5 stars is overall weight - probably attributable to the sturdy construction and collection of high quality on-board attachments.Although we got ours via Amazon (no problems), found the exact same model cheaper at Wal-Mart."
4,was what we expected!,"Was shipped quickly and when used it performs well as expected. Well contructed and I believe it will hold up well.If you are looking to roll side to side on back to stretch out the spine this is a perfect fit for a woman 5'8"". I was a little worried about it being too big, but it is perfect."
4,Changer handles up to 120 watt panel,Changer handles up to 120 watt panel and little more. Of course if your panels are older or have shady spots it may handle more wattage at a reduced effeciency.
5,Sunforce Charge controller,"Received it with the solar panel and wire kit. Had it going in a few minutes. Charging a camper battery. It did not take long at all and the battery was fully charged. The battery lasted all night with the 12V heater going all night. Hooked it up again the next morning no problems, charged the battery again. This was well worth the cost, Saves fuel having to run motor for hours to charge battery."
4,Been working perfectly for three years,"I have two 20 watt solar panels connected to this controller, along with eight 7Ah 12V sealed batteries on the output side. I've had absolutely no problems for the last three years...the batteries charge up during the day and feed my yard lights for a few hours each evening. It's worked reliably as annual temperatures cycled from near freezing to 105+ degrees."
3,small lead wires,"The lead wires on this unit are a very small size. The unit is sealed, so they cannot be changed.I have installed other solar controllers and was able to use a decent size wire for more currentcapacity. I will opt for one with a terminal connection in the future."
1,Worst experience + worst manufacture,"Ladies,Just move on, do no waste your time and money.I purchased a pair of size 6 from this seller, but the shoes were waaaay too small to put on even though i wear size 6. So I returned size 6 and purchased size 7.Now the story begins. Size 7 comes, and they were still waaaaau too small. My experience they feel like size 5. The seller got a measure problem, clearly their size is not American standard. As I was frustrated with this shopping experience, I was also increasingly pissed off by the fact that 2 weeks passed by, I still didnt receive my refund from this seller.Finally I contactec Amazon.com. Fortunately Amazon.com reimbersed me the whole amount, and the investigation closed today.. Tomorrow, I would have to return the second pair, size 7.Oh, you should also know, the shoes are not as hot as the pics displayed online."
5,THIS IS A KEEPER!,This is a wonderful inspirational movie with a terrific cast. It's one to enjoy over and over again.
5,Another Excellent Book,"This is an exceptional book from an excellent chess trainer. Anyone that has met or corresponded with Dan knows that he may read USCF rules to you, but only because of his extensive knowledge of them, and only if they help you with your own game. He would never take undeserved money from a student, and in fact is very generous with his time and understanding of those who can't quite afford his lessons. His books and wisdom have made many beginners into competitive tournament players. I have not read all of this book yet, but from what I have seen, it is a must buy for any beginner player, and many intermediate players will find it useful as well."
4,Great Workout,"If you want to get a great workout in the comfort of your home and get great results, this is the video for you. It will get your muscles moving without having to do extreme movements. Great to do with the kids too."
4,Does the job!!!,"I am a young person (23yrs) and in pretty good shape and when I saw this DVD I was hesitant in buying it because I thought it wouldn't give me a good workout. However when I purchased it, I have not regretted it! I love it, it's a great workout, I love the 2 mile walk and do that more often! (If not all the time) I would totally recommend this to any person at any age."
1,Chasing Cars-Snow Patrol,I bought some type of promotional cd that took a month to get here and had only two songs on it...was extremely disappointed that was not made clear when I ordered it. Would have like to return it but did not want to go through hassle.
1,This book is awful,"I was hoping for a good recap of the 2000 season, but what I got instead was a boring diary about Nayer's personal life."
4,Their newest live-recording,"On this live CD are the best songs from their albums ""Over the hump"", ""Almost heaven"" and ""Growin up"". I have been to four Kelly Family - concerts and I enjoed all of them. They are great livesingers and sound on concerts just as good as on their records.But it's a pity that there are no new songs on it - only the drum solo."
2,An Academic who claims to be a designer. . .and then writes a book,"Having used this book for a few semesters, I offer you this: Avoid this book, unless you too are an academic who has nothing real to offer the world of video games in terms of game design or actual game production.If you are the same type of person that enjoys diagramming sentences or likes to discuss why other people have created artistic things in the manner they did - rather than create something yourself, then you may enjoy this.[...] I am of the opinion that a person writing on such a topic might be better equipped to do so after having designed a few AAA titles. Then again, people like that tend to be busy working on games.Buyer beware. I was required to buy this book and was unable to ""Dodge this bullet"". To each, their own."
1,Dodge this bullet!,"As a life-long game designer, I've worked on dozens of projects from multi-million dollar blockbusters to academic experimentation & pure research. The current glut of high brow nonsense being passed on as educational literature appalls me. Case in point: The authors here have laughable credentials. Furthermore, anyone with the internet can get this ""information"" for free. Cashing in on a gullible public has become a ubiquitous pastime in the game literature pyramid scheme, don't fall victim to it's wrath."
1,Mediocre at best. Easily forgettable.,"Managed to finally get through this wordy behemoth. Now that I have, I'm not sure that it was worth the battle. The historic/cultural analysis is quite one sided, leaving the most controversial topics entirely untouched. The text reads like a ""retro-gamers guide to the universe"", and fails to offer any meaningful examination of game design topics. Certainly not enough to warrant calling it a ""textbook"" or ""reference book"" (as the books description claims).If you are interested in game design, skip this one and look to others like Chris Crawford for intellectual stimulation."
3,Teacher's Grade: C+,"This was another fun and quirky adventure for Zack and his dad as Zack encounters a talking turnip named Elvis. There's not much of a plot in this outing, and Zack is never in peril of any kind so the suspense is kind of thin. Overall, this was one of the more amusing Zack books but also one of the least satisfying.I'm a 2nd grade teacher and have read this entire series, but won't be steering my class toward this one. Most kids I work with aren't Elvis fans and won't get much of the humor."
2,Ambiguously cool,"2 1/2Muggs excels at grimy, beat-driven atmospherics, though struggles to fill up all the open space he creates with little more than airy, semi-formless vocalizations."
1,"no, no, no!","It says here that this can opener is stainless steel, so I bought it. When I recieved it, I washed so that I can use it immediately i needed. I used it a couple of weeks later and there is rust forming on the part where it opens the cans. And I returned it. It was also not that durable because when I used it the screw got screwed and never worked ever again."
3,Voices from the Reservation?,"This book provided a view into the Warm Springs Reservation, whether or not it is a realistic view remains to be seen. The ""voices"" the authors chose to include in the book were not the best ""voices"". Some of the people interviewed were newcomers to the reservation, had only lived on the reservation for a short period of time years ago, and a couple were bigots who lived in the border town. Since the authors seemed to focus a lot on educational issues and youth issues, it would make sense to include interviews of youth. None were included. Also lacking in the book were the ""voices"" of tribal elders and leaders. Where were they? The authors give no explanation for the lack of these ""voices"". I believe that they would have provided important and informative viewpoints. Perhaps if the authors had included a list of interviews they tried to obtain, I might not have such a harsh opinion of the authors and their work."
4,Works well,"This panel works like a charm. But if you want a little more power, i would recomend the50 Watt Solar Panel - CDT-50w 12V Crystalline PV module #31050. It comes out to be cheaper $/watt."
1,quit working,"The panel still puts out good voltage, but short circuit current in full daylight went close to 30 to 50 mA. I had it for about 5 months, and it worked great for a while. I had it hooked to a regulator which charged a 12V gelcel battery. It has just turned into a decoration. Rats."
4,BIG SIZE COOKIE BIG SIZE TASTE,Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies are not just for breakfast. You can have one anytime and they are so big you will enjoy eating them for a long time. We ordered the Oatmeal Raisin cookies and they were so moist and delicious. I wondered where they were going to so fast and discovered that my husband was taking them to work with him. So they must be very good because he is not a dessert person at all!
2,breakfast cookie,"Personally, I was disappointed in the breakfast cookie. I thought them rather bland and high in calories. My son, though, thought they were great. Maybe it is an age thing."
5,phones,"black color stinks,,,,my first one was white,,it goes with my white kitchen,,cant shut ringer off so i put a little piece of duct tape neatly over the speaker,,,neaver had a problem with the sound,,i talk to brasil every day,,bought my 1st one in ch martin in fairview nj,,for 8.99,,,i only bought it for the speed dial an speaker phone,,,i bought a black one from amazon to keep as a spare,,i just hooked up my second white 1 last wk. it works gd.,,ear volume is gd. also,,,,my portable phones are my main source,,,"
2,pretty weak,"I bought this because i was being a lazy a** and i dint want to run amp wires in my Talon TSI, the install was super easy but when i turned it up the poor little sub was completely drowned out by my door speakers. very subtle bass. go with at least the 100w one, you'll be glad you did."
1,Master Car Stereo Installer Review,I have installed 50 or so of Baz. All different sizes. The bass is sloppy and non existent. The speaker/driver is so cheap it cannot even handle the built in amp. Baz. blow more speakers than any other sub in the world.Try something else.
1,BUY THE UK FULL LENGTH VERSION,"i bought the UK version seasons 2 and 3 to get the full version and it's great.The show is great, but this version is a rip off shortened episodes.why don't they give us the full version??why shorten the version??i will not buy from this company if they don't give the full procduct."
3,too short,I ordered these because I had a similar pair which came with the Ronco Rotisserie gizmo. They were perfect for removing meat and carrying but eventually needed to be thrown out. Now I have a smoker and thought the gloves would be good for pulling meat without piercing and too large for tongs. Well they are just a bit too short for my liking.
5,Love these gloves,"Purchased these to be able to shred pork off the smoker and they work great. Jump in there and shred away, and then just wash them with soap while they are still on like washing your hands. Great as light (very light) oven mitts as well"
1,Do you enjoy the smell of chemicals? And plasticizers in your food?,"I can't say I have an opinion regarding Steven Reichlen, or at least I didn't have an opinion. He should be ashamed to lend his name to sell this product. Why?Upon opening the box, I was overwhelmed by the stench of plasticizers. I went beyond the directions of washing them in hot soapy water, soaked them in hot soap water and let them dry. End result? They still stink of plasticizers (the chemicals used to make cheap plastics soft). Even after washing, they're still so malodorous that I had to place them out on the porch and my fingers smell from handling them. These are ""food safe""?!?Have I used them? No! There is no way I'm going to handle food with these things. Back to Amazon they go. Made in China, of course."
1,dirt bags,"Good idea poorly executed! The pair I got are loaded with crud between the lining and the exterior. You can see the raised crud bumps all over them, one piece looks like it might be a piece of metal sandwiched in. One finger is permanently discolored. They are made in China, where else, and judging by my pair they must have been made in a very filthy factory because of all the dirt embedded in them. I honestly have serious reservations about using them to handle food, and will probably just throw them away to play it safe, since they weren't that costly to hassle returning them."
3,Wasn't impressed,"I bought these gloves to do pulled pork and shredded chicken with. They are well insulated to protect from heat of the food, but since there is no texture on the surface of the finger tips, they become slick and you can't grip anything or hold its when it greasy. I gave up trying to use them to pull pork. Its your call...I would have expected more with the celebrity name put on it."
1,useless for heat,Don't buy these gloves if you might touch metal when removing your meat from the grill. These melted down the first time they touched the skewers when taking chicken off the gas grill. There is now a hole melted across the glove. They arrived without packaging. They should have a warning not to be used on anything metal. Useless for almost all grilling.
2,The Gloves are Too large,"for a good fit of my hands. Appear to be made for a person with much larger hands. I did not see a size choice when I made my purchase; if I had I would have chosen a ""Medium"" size glove. I have Not used these gloves yet, but feel I will have some difficulty using them to pull apart a pork roast, etc."
5,nice,The gloves worked great for the week of smoking I did over christmas. They did well for cutting turkey and pulling hot pork at 200 degrees.
4,Very well insulated,These gloves are very well insulated. The only negative I have is when you are working with BBQ they are too slick to take off. It would be nice if they incorporated little gripper bumps on the fingertips.
3,Huh?,"This adaptation went as far from the story line as you can get and still cal piece ""Jane Eyre."" It is unecessarily tarted up - it would be as good of a story without having 'chemistry' between lead character practicaly hitting you about the head, and not in a good way. Also, what's up with 'Rochester' being so rude all the time?On the other hand, Ruth Wilson is fantastic actress, Toby Stephens is a hottie, and scenery was lovely and lush. BBC can't really make anything too horrible, but this is not their most outstanding job."
5,"Best version ever made, hands down!!!!","I can't say enough about this version of Jane Eyre. Although I have to agree with other reviews that they made both characters 'too pretty', I believe that the acting portrayed by Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson is on another level. I have seen every version and read the book many times but this movie still kept me on the edge of my seat until the end to see how it would pan out. Great movie and I doubt there will be another version to top this one."
5,Outstanding!,"I love period romances and this is going right in my top 5 of all time. This is an amazing story, told and acted so well. The chemistry between Jane and Edward is so thick you could cut it with a knife. I would reccomend this film to anyone who loves romance or just plain loves a good story. Brilliant acting, wonderful scenery and so well written! I know that Jane is suppose to be plain but I found Ruth Wilson to be beautiful, understated of course like a Mourning dove. Edward was not suppose to be as attractive as Toby Stephens but they didn't make him overly dashing. He adds a smoldering passion and sexuality to the part that makes the story even more swoon-worthy. 4 stars, baby!!!Cheers!Mary Clark"
5,Jane Eyre,"I saw it on TV and had to buy the DVDsomewhat modernized, romantic taleprobably the sexiest Rochester ever"
3,"""Jane Eyre"" a Horror Movie?","I really liked both Rochester and Jane in this version of ""Jane Eyre."" The acting was superb, and I enjoyed the passion and connection between the two main characters. This movie was ruined for me because every scene where Rochester's Lunatic wife was around was too much like a horror movie, and for this reason I will not be purchasing this version. This movie is however 100% better than the 1980's BBC version (it's like a bad soap opera)."
2,A diffrence of opinion,"Realitives told me how good this movie was and so I decided to buy it.However, in my opinion it wasn't worth the money I spent on it. I was sadly disappointed in this purchase."
5,Sooo good,"I love this actress. I wish she was in more stuff. I had to watch a scene several times, because I loved it so much. If you like Jane Austen movies like the old Pride and Prejudice (with Colin Firth), you will definitely like this Bronte movie. The only thing I can say is that some parts come off weirder than they are, but stick through it, it will all come together in the end:)"
3,good for price,"I wanted a tea box that I could actually put my own tea in, so this review is just on the box. The box is nice, but the slots are too small for other brand tea bags (Which was the whole reason why I bought it). This would be a nice gift since it is a good price, but you have to refill it with the same tea or small tea bags."
1,This Box is Junk,"This item deserves no stars (it forced me to give at least one, which I only did so I could write this review and warn people away from this product).The box is embarrassingly cheap; the tea is old and flavorless.I wouldn't present this tea to the stray dog down the street, for fear of offending his sensibilities (even he has his standards; something Bentley's clearly lacks).I have been taken advantage of with this purchase. Fool me once shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. No more Bentley's for me."
5,What a wondeful gift for a tea lover,I bought this as a gift for a family member that loves tea. When it arrived I was very happy with the way that is was packaged so that there would be no chance of damage during shipping. The chest is very nice and the tea packaged inside looks very pretty. I can't wait to give this to them.
4,Excellent if you like Chuck D,"Only listened to the first song so far, but so far, so good. Excellent lyrics/spoken word with musical background.... If you like his solo album as Mistachuck, you should like this."
4,Can't Go Wrong for the money,"This Ipod Boom Box has Unbelievable sound for the price... After trying about 3 of them this one is my go to unit. Has plenty of volume and plenty of bass... There are 2 reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 and they are both pretty minor. First, the remote functions are pretty basic and you can't access your music menu to choose artists or albums.. And second, the unit won't charge your device which could be apples fault and not MTX's....Overall I'm very very pleased with the value.."
3,So many words....,"Writing about the kali-yuga is a daunting task. So, the author deserves points for effort. Nevertheless, I found this book very disappointing. The too clever and precious eccentricity of the Table of Contents was a sign of self-indulgences yet to come.The author quotes freely from such fine authors as Guenon, Schuon, Eliade and a host of others. Frankly, time spent with these authors will serve one far better than time spent with Marty Glass. To find worthwhile insights herein, one has to put up with torrents of undisciplined, ponderous prose and cliched revelations.One minor but considerable annoyance is the Index. It is so astonishingly incomplete that one wonders why the author bothered."
2,Not the greatest..,"This book was used in my software engineering class at college. Overall, the material in this book was presented in a very boring and complex manner, focusing on jargon definitions and a few isolated examples.Although the book does explain software engineering, it tends to do so in a painful way. Do yourself a favor and pick another book on the subject."
4,Helped me out of a jam,This product was needed to help me get through a very tough class. It got here faster than expected and in good shape.
1,Poor Information and very confusing,The information in this book is very confusing and the example are not clear.
3,short straps if you're tall,"I bought this ""soft"" bra because I need a bra to sleep in. This would be a great choice except that the bra straps are too short for me, resulting in sore shoulders with deep groves in them after a few hours of wearing it. I am a tall girl at 5'11' and at 34DD pretty big. If you are shorter it would be a fine choice. It is comfortable and supportive, just those straps are too short for me, and they are not adjustable."
2,Poor documentary,"I bought this hoping for a good intro to Duchamp for an art history class, and it's very, very, very disappointing. Little content beyond the names of the works (OUT OF SYNCH, YET!) intoned above generic background music. No interviews, no intellectual content. I bought another Artists of the 20th Century DVD on Picasso at the same time, and it is only marginally better. I don;t know that they are all hastily and poorly made, but buyer, beware.AFAIK, no good doc on Duchamp exists. What's up with that, art world?"
1,incorrect title,"this is not WOOL. this is synthetic. but, the seller was very nice and i was able to return it immediately. i don't know why it's still up though..."
3,Cable Clip Wall Holders,"The plastic is made very well but the nails that came with these are just not long enough to go into the wall and hold the cable solidly, they popped out very easily, so I had to buy longer nails to hold the cable to the wall. I did receive them quickly and the plastic holds up nicely so I still gave them a three star rating."
3,"Works as expected, but not an exact fit","Bought this only because it was included under ""frequently bought together"" along with the RG6 F Type Quad Shielded Coaxial 18AWG CL2 Rated 75Ohm Cable - 100ft - WHITE. Should've done a little more research, as there is some slack between the cable and the clips, Would have liked it to be exact, but at 31 cents per 100, can't really complain."
5,Very good,"I purchased these because I needed to run my cable wire around a door frame and needed something to hold it in place and that would blend in with my white door frame. These fit the bill, they are very easy to use and look clean and professional. Also, the seller sent the item very quickly. I'm a very happy customer!"
2,Not exactly what I wanted,The clips I received are larger than the RG6 quad shield cable I am using. If you are expecting to secure the cable tightly to framing members these clips won't do it. The cable will slide in the clip so these are more like guides than clips. I'll use these for most of my runs but will get some smaller ones to use in critical locations. If I would have known they were this large I would not have purchased.
4,Great.,Items were ship quickly and were as described. they did the work that I intended them to which was to pin my hometheater wires to the wall.
3,Good for this kind of camping,"This book isn't for someone who wants to learn to be attuned to nature, or be able to flow with nature. I recommend Tom Brown Jr.'s books."
4,Motor NOT included,"This is a great set of K'Nex, but be warned that the ""spring motor that powers the models"" described in the item description is NOT included in this kit. It is merely 400 pieces and a model book in a handy red tub, which is valuable enough, but if you would like to ""motorize"" your creations, you'll have to supplement this kit with a set that contains a motor."
5,"If your child is a builder, this is perfect for him/her!","Our son was building all sorts of creations with Legos, but this KNex set has allowed him to build to a whole new level. He now can make things rotate, and flip, and transform! This is a great set for a child 5 and up. Our son plays for hours in his room with this and doesn't get bored."
5,Value Tub,"Wonderful, wonderful gift. This was the tear open one for my nephew. He is the king of legos, but loved the idea of something new!"
4,sizes,"Just wanted to add to the issue that many have mentioned about the size of these knex tubs. I have found that if it doesn't have anything but just knex then most likely it is these micro/mini ones. The ones marked as ""classic"" seem to be the ""regular"" or original size."
1,Mini rather than regular size,"I'm kicking myself for buying this set for my boys as their ""shared"" gift for Christmas. Luckily I opened it up before Christmas morning and decided to give it to them as a ""Christmas break"" surprise. I don't understand why such a large container was needed for such a SMALL amount of K'nex. Extremely disappointing! Normally I read the reviews before buying, but I was excited about the price ($10.16). If I had paid full price for this set, I would've sent it back promptly!"
3,It's Okay.,"I got it for my sister on Christmas. She played with it only and Christmas and never looked at it again. There are very little directions that come with it, and it is very confusing. I suggest just sticking to Legos."
1,Crappy- don't buy it.,"When I was a kid K'nex were great. But this tub was a terrible purchase. For whatever reason they have two different sizes of K'nex pieces in this box that don't all fit together. I bought this for my nephews because they always had a blast playing with the k'nex sets that I had while I was growing up- but when they opened this box on their birthday and saw the small amount of pieces in the box and how they were different sizes I think they were pretty disappointed. I was embarrassed and disappointed too... Don't buy this set- it is totally crap and not worth the money at all! In fact, there are only like two different things that can be built from the pieces that are provided in this set- and definitely not enough total pieces to allow the kids to create their own things. This is a bad buy- stay away!"
2,way to small,"the pieces barely cover the bottom of the container, they are very very small not the normal size Knex. they could of easily made that tub a quarter of its size and still easily hold all the pieces."
1,Parts too small....not for KIDS below 21...,Parts are tooooooooooooooooooo small.. make the shapes as decribed is possible if you are above 21 and way too smart... not for KIDS....PLEASE DON'T BUY FOR KIDS
1,I HATE DYSON.... here's why:,"All Michael Eric Dyson does: is speak rapid-fire and use ""Big Words"" to sound intelligent. He is NOT! If you ever saw him on TV, you would know what I mean. He is a ""Professor"" and ""Reverend"" who makes up facts, when he is questioned, to support his fallacious claims. I checked this out this book at the Library...Boycott this fool, he is racially dividing the country and his earlier works advocate the use of violence!"
2,Normally I am on the same page with Dyson.,"Normally, I am on the same page with Dyson, but he lost me with this one. I agree with much of what he was saying, but the flaw for me was his inability to present both sides of the argument. He did an excellent job of explaining why Cosby was ""out of line"". Whereas I lean towards Dyson in his arguments, I do share some of Cosby's concerns. I was hoping this book would provide a sense of clarity, but it didn't.I was also a little annoyed by what I felt were strong personal attacks towards Cosby. I understand that Cosby is the one who put himself out there, but I was still a little unnerved."
2,Good Research. Bad excuses.,"As a white male teacher in one of these schools with a majority of minorities as students I was instantly interested in Mr. Dysons book title. The research was very good, especially in showing the gap in money that is spent per student in different school districts. I teach in a district on the low end. Here is where we are going to disagree - my students are not allowed to use this as an excuse. I was raised by a single parent, below the poverty line - but I was always told that education was my ticket. Parenting, no matter what your race, has got to encourage kids as to what they can accomplish not discourage them with what they cannot accomplish.Those that would like to read two really fantastic books on the racial divide between whites and blacks, please check out ""Losing the Race: Self-sabotage in Black America"" and ""Winning the Race: Beyond the crisis in Black America""."
5,LOVE this Cd,Great music and soothing sounds for any babies and even older children. Our children really enjoy them in the car.
5,fabulous,"This is a DVD that any age would love in their collection, I love that it has Amy Winehouse in it, every support act is brilliant especially Aretha Franklin, she makes me cry every time I listen to her song"
3,DO NOT USE WITH HANDS FREE HEAD SET,"I purchased this item because I tele-work and need a base unit for my hands free headset. The part they dont tell you is the phone head set it required to make it work. If you disconnect the head set, the phone is brick. All the controls are in the head set which makes it really heavy also. The ""hold"" button plays cheesy digital music and there's no mute. I ended up giving it to a neighbor in exchange for her old nasty kitchen wall phone."
5,The best D/s Murder Mystery Ever,"John Warren's book is like a breath of fresh air. His scene players are so life like, there had to be alot of research that went into the writing of this book. This is a short, compact, and fast-paced work, unlike some of the more amateurish stuff by the likes of Gary S. Kadet. John's humor is a thing of beauty. I plan to tell everyone I see, to go out and buy the book."
1,This is NOT my favorite book,This is a really boring book about two friends and any one crazy enough to read it is going to have a not so fun time reading it. I highly recomend NOT to read this book.
5,Great coming of age novel,"The friends is about the friendship of Phyllisia, and Edith. Phyllisia is a new student in a Harlem school who is made fun of because of her West Indian style of talk. Edith is poorly dressed girl, who is the only one willing to be friends with Edith. Even though Edith is the one nice to Phyl, she still thinks she is better than her, and love hurting Edith's feeling time after time. Phyl is ashamed of her mom meeting Edith. Edith's mom is battling breast cancer. The friends is a good novel for anyone to read, and get something from it about the right way to treat people."
5,Very Interesting,"This book's protagonist was Phyllisia, a West Indian teen who just moved to Harlem, NY. People hated her and she was beaten and called names. I felt very bad for her during these times. Also, her father who she secretly LOATHED abused her and probably hated her too. Her mom was dying of breast cancer but there was a light at the end of the tunnel-Edith. Edith was very different from Phyllisia in financial status but they were the best of friends. Edith was recently orphaned and was left to raise her young sisters with her brother. he story has an OK ending but the events that led up to it were exciting. (This book will take about less than a day to read..I read it in 1 period...)"
1,Poorly Researched,"This book was disappointing on a number of levels. The most obvious is the poor editing - there are a number of obvious typos and grammatical errors. But the worst part about this book is the many times the author tries to pass off legends, rumors, and complete inaccuracies for historical fact. If you enjoy being hoodwinked by urban legends and tricked into believing that things that might have happened, actually did happen, then this book is for you. But if you are interested in facts, you'd better pass."
4,Powerful fantasy story of love,"This is a well-written story of a young girl trying to learn of her roots. At nine years old she knows little about her mother or father. She lives with an old fisherman. The old man has told her he found her in the woods, but warns her to stay away, or the ghouls in the forest will get her.Young children, especially girls, will enjoy this story."
3,"Ghosts, Goblins, Ghouls and a Great Willow","Tree Girl by T.A. Barron, is the story of a girl, lost from her mother, on the mysterious adventure to find her mother. The book is a childish, fantasy world, with a wonderful story and good lessons to tell. The book is seen through the eyes of young Anna who is eager to find her mother. As the story progresses Anna matures and learns things every step of the way. I could appreciate this portrayal of a ""coming of age"" type situation. This is one of the bigger themes in the story. Another theme, believing in your self, is shown throughout the book, as young Anna wanders off into the woods, despite this being forbidden. The book is well written and an easy read, while it can still be appreciated by all ages and gender, some may not like it's childish manner."
5,super memory-super student,"Helpful information in a easy to understand format. For me, it is one of several books I bought on the subject. It is very informative without being boring and the same old stuff."
5,You HAVE to get this book.,"I have ""the"" WORST memory in the world!Be patient and read it like a fun fact book.Spend the time and effort to understand what the author is trying to say and why he is making you do silly exercises.I am amazed that I can recall the 10 word exercise, list it correctly forward and backwards!I can't wait to read through all his books and train my memory with this brilliant authors techniques."
2,Wooden Flip Flops are a Flop,"My daughter received a pair of these shoes for her birthday. When we opened the package, the 5 tubs of paint were either completely dried out or so gloppy and sticky that they were unusable. One of the paint brushes was all crusty and hard. The seal had not been broken on the packet of supplies inside the package, so it is not like someone else damaged it. We ended up having to use some of my own acrylic paint to do the shoes. Thank goodness I had some of my own because my daughter was devastated that the paint was ""icky"" and that we weren't going to be able to paint her shoes. They also supplied a jar of clear nailpolish to ""seal"" your shoes with. You can imagine...a sticky, streaky mess. I wouldn't buy these again."
3,Perhaps maiming but not killer,"I was disappointed. This is not to say that it was not a good album, the production was excellent and the beats had their s$%t flicking, but it did not match the standard for excellence set by Killer Mike's previous work. Do not expect an album full of the clever and quirky lyrics heard on his verses in ""whole world"" and ""land of a million drums."" He does have some standout moments, most notably the collaboration with fellow e-tripping heavy weight, Bizarre, track #8. However it is a rare gem. Outkast set the stage perfectly for him, but unfortunately Mike could not gold the spotlight in the studio as well as he does live. Truth is, his subject matter sounds more like a certain blonde shady MC than the Dungeon Family material one might expect. If you like stuff like Eminem and Too Short, you'll enjoy this disc. Will you love it? Probably not, but you will be entertained and will probably find yourself quoting it."
2,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this album, and I did not like it, there were only 2 songs on the entire C.D. worth listening to, the beats are awful, and the lyrics are good, but it sounds like he is reading them, does'nt know his own songs.There are 31 tracks on the c.d., but 9 of them are blank. Do not waste your money, take my advice."
3,"Good Debut, Will Only Get Better","I liked this CD. It was 10 bucks at some CD store along side 20 dollar CDs so I decided to pick it up because I know he has an allience with Outkast. It was good, no doubt, but the beats were somewhat stale and sounded the exact same at times...don't get me wrong, there are some good beats, but there are some bad ones. And I hate Bizarre but he was better on this then he is on D12 albums.I think this kid is only going to get better and if he gets some better beats and with a little more creativiy, Killer Mike could be really killing mics."
3,Pretty Good,"This CD was alright, and i liked the price. But the biggest aspect that lacks in all of mikes songs are the Chorus, most of them are on liners, even one word chorus's repeated over and over. Example:(All day I dream about...)(All day I dream about sex)which basically is played over and over, but the rapping is pretty tight, another song is freak show, he says that over and over, then theres monster where he says im your monster over and over, then theres other ones but im not sure what the songs are called yet since Ive only listened to this cd like 4 times."
3,Not For Every Tenchi Fan,"For those who can't stand listening to the Japanese songs, this CD is for you. The entire CD is translated and sung in English; easy to follow and to sing along with the included lyrics. However, all of the songs were of mediocre performance. You could even hear the performers take their breaths just before they launch into the next verse. An excellent example is ""Washu's Lullaby"" and ""Sleeping Beauty on the Balcony"". And having someone sing in the ""squeaky"" Sasami voice for ""Pretty Sammy the Magical Girl"" just doesn't mix. The chemistry is off. For those who love the original Japanese songs; you can pass on this CD."
2,b4k4,whoopie. This cd wuz aiight...but its ALL IN ENGLISH! The english versions of the Tenchi songs...(shiver)...they're not all too bad...but the singers could do such a better job! It's like they're not even trying thruout the ENTIRE CD! Do yourself a favor n go get the Japanese versions
5,TNA best wrester,This was very entertaining and it went in depth. This guy was TNA first home grown star. He really put out some very good matches and has some good wresting moves. If you are a TNA and/or wrestling fan you should get this.
3,Could have been better,"This is a great dvd. It's just that it's nothing but a rerelease. There are no new matches or content. However, it's still a great dvd. The matches involving AJ with Jerry Lynn, Low-Ki, Sean Waltman (X-pac), D-Lo Brown, and Abyss are incredible. It was also cool seeing TNA back in the days they were doing weekly shows. If you're a AJ, TNA, or just a general wrestling fan, buy it."
5,Remarkable CD,If you like native american music...you will enjoy this Christmas CD. Jana's voice is amazing. Highly recommend any of Jana's music.
5,American Indiam Christmas,"Jana has a pure, clear, beautiful voice. Hearing the familiar Christmas songs in different languages gives the beautiful old songs a new and appealing sound. Silent Night and Amazing Grace are especially beautiful.W McClelland"
4,Bead on a Wire: Making Handcrafted Wire and Beaded Jewelry,"I am a beginning beader, and this book helped me by explaining beading tools and techniques. The designs are helpful, too."
5,New Beader,This is such a great book. Even if you are just starting out like I am you can pick up this book and make the items in it with the step by step instructions. It also helps you pick up on the lingo. I love it.
5,Bead on Wire: Making Handcrafted Wire and Beaded Jewelry,I like to wire wrap and the directions and photographs makes it easy to understand. Great to practice with using less expensive material other then gold or sterling.
4,Good place to start,Although new to beading this book provided some great information on the processes involved. I found it to be very helpful and will refer to it again and work on some of the projects found inside its covers.
5,Bead on a Wire: Making Handcrafted Wire and Beaded Jewelry,"This book has great step-by-step instructions for making wire jewelry accompanied by clear and excellent numbered photos. After thoroughly explaining the various tools and techniques, the author includes several wire-based jewelry projects and explains the process of their construction. Great photos with clear and concise text."
4,Great product,This is a great fog machine. I got it and it worked fine. Then I put it away and next time I tried it it didn't work. But that is because you have to clean it with a sulution of viniger and water. (the exact amounts are in the instruscion booklet). And you also have to empyt the tank before storing. So read the instructions and it will work great. If you just got upset and wrote a bad review well come on at least read the instrustions!!!!!
2,Produces a piddly amount of fog and you have to stand by it all night hitting the button,"This fog machine is sad, sad, sad. It produces a sad, small, teeny amount of fog. We thought that perhaps the room was just too large so we tested it out by aiming it into the pantry. It *might* have worked ok if it had a continuous use setting, but the way it works, you need to hold the button down while it pushes out a teeny bit of fog for about 30 seconds. Then it stops emitting while it heats back up, which takes about 1 minute, during which time the fog that you already sent out there totally disappears - then you get to hold the button down again for 30 seconds worth of piddle fog. We even purchased high quality fog juice... A 100% waste of money."
3,fog,bought it because it was a great price didn't use it for what I wanted to it is good for people in the arts for lighting
5,Liked it!,"I teach 5th grade and used the activities in this book to supplement the text and online scavenger hunts that we did as a group. What I like about the activities in this book is that they work for a wide range of skill levels. The gifted students in the class were having as much fun with the activities as the students who are severely impaired. All of the students were placed into groups and they were all able to do the activities with little help outside their groups. There are so many different activities in the book it was impossible to use them all, so it's important to select the things that look appropriate for your group of learners. Parents liked what they saw when we were finished, and the students had a very nice finished product."
1,Bar BQ Lite,"We were not too happy with this light. It clips onto the grill just fine but it just does not have enought ""light"" to grill by."
2,Khe Sanh: Siege in the Clouds,"While interesting, I felt that the many remarks from persons at Khe Sanh during the siege were not necessarily well organized and did not provide substantive character background. Although it appears to provide an accurate assessment of the times, I believe the book was disjunctive and did not flow well."
5,One of her most intriguing works,This book deals with Dion Fortune and her order's work in Magickal defense of their island. I have often heard old timers refer to the magical battle of Britain. This shows the step by step methods and the rituals used. Gareth Knight has done the public a service in helping bringing this book to print.
1,Just reading the responses here,Hmmm the responses here seem interesting.at one time many Germans also believed Mein Kampf was true...
4,An entertaining read,"For the aspiring business student, this is a must read. It's fast and full of good stories and practical tips. For the seasoned executive, you'll recognize the playbook because you're likely already following most of these strategies.Hardball is a book that doesn't take itself too seriously but has a definite purpose -- I got the sense that the authors had fun composing the chapters and were being intentionally provocative. They put an old truth on the table -- winning is about getting the fundamentals right -- and serve it up in compelling, bite-sized pieces. Then they invite readers to assess whether they have what it takes to relentlessly create competitive advantage.Today, when the mantra ""everyone is a winner"" reigns supreme, this quick dose of reality is refreshing and well-timed."
2,How did this book get 4 1/2 stars?,"Of all the various golf instruction books I've read, from Hogan's ""Five Lessons"" to both of Dave Pelz's books, this is the worst golf instruction book I've read so far. Although I love Ernie's swing (his tempo is so smooth) this book is just too general. The only reason this book didn't get one star is because the photo's aren't too bad. However if you were looking to purchase a book on golf instruction to improve your swing, look elsewhere, Harvey Penick's books, although lacking photos, would do more for your game then this book will do for your swing!"
4,"Liked the album for the most part, but it's strange","I first caught wind of this band when it performed ""Wedding Vows in Vegas"" with Frank Sinatra, Jr., on the David Letterman Show. I picked up the tape and listened to it over and over again. It's a strange mixture of songs from an odd band. Nevertheless, I liked most of the album. I especially love ""Spy in The House of Love""."
2,"Not Terrible, but Not Very Good Either","Basically, I like what Photoshop Elements is trying to do. But it doesn't handle storing very many photos before it starts slowing down. And it will start lagging for very long periods of time too.If there were no other options, I would keep trying to make it work. But Google has released ""Picasa"", which is essentially the same kind of tool. And Picasa is way better, and free too. (I am NOT affiliated with Google... Just very happy to find a really good photo management and basic editing package)"
1,Revue of Elements 5.0,"I have found this program uneccessarily complicated and tedious to manipulate. There are free programs which are far easier to operate, with features equal to all Elements offerings, for the average advanced user."
4,"Great Product, Poor Customer Service","I agree with the positive reviews of PSE 5, but just wanted to warn anyone here that Adobe's service is horrible. Expect to wait 10-20 minutes just to speak to anyone, even sales! I won't go into the details as to why I had to call (LONG STORY!!!), but I will tell you that I used up almost all of my cellphone minutes over 3 nights of calls to adobe. And no, my problem (not with the software, was with the lost delivery) was never fixed. I ended up getting tired of them and just blowing 100 bucks. Once again, I love the software, but don't like adobe. Just don't let that stop you, it's still THE photo editing program. Oh, and to anyone that bought 4.0 between Sept. 12 and sometime in December, Adobe has a free upgrade, ALL you have to do is call them. Check out the current specials on the website. The details are there. Don't say that's not helpful."
2,New Version 1 week later!,"I did not appreciate a new version (6.0)designed for Vista being available 1 week after my purchase in October, 2007. There was no indication of the an upcoming proper ""Vista"" designed version on the Adobe website or Amazon."
5,Photos better than ever,I love Adobe Photoshop Elements 5. It is easy to use and makes such a difference in the quality of my printed photos. Editing is so much easier. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in Photography.
5,Great for babies,My son loves the books because they are quick reads that are more interactive. Perfect size for a baby on the go! The box set is definitely the best deal. Very pleased.
4,Help Yourself Get Out of Emotional Regression,"A very easy and straight forward approach to identifying and coping with emotional regression...especially for those who are suffering in that downward spiral. After being in a long term relationship with someone with BPD this book afforded me a new found freedom from the pain and suffering their complicaitons cause. I found this book to be a must read for anyone who is affected by a loved one that suffers with BPD, NPD or Manic-Depression."
5,GREAT RESOURCE BOOK,"THis is a great resource book for carvers. Not only do you get ideal instruction on how to paint wildlife, there are numerous illustrations on noses and eyes. I would recommend this book to any wildlife carver. The delivery was very prompt and the book was just as they said."
2,Buy it in Ghana,"As far as instruction goes, this book is not great, but it just about the only one out there. First of all it does not give much information on phonetics and neglets to instruct the learner that the letter combination re- in a certain tense change is not pronounced. It just signifies that the vowel sound in the subject should be pronounced longer. This is just one example.In addition, Ghanaians would be more than happy to teach you Twi, and this is the best way to learn and meet people.My advice, to those who can, is to wait and purchase this book in Ghana. It can be purchsed at the University of Ghana-Legon bookstore for about US$4.00."
4,Breath of Fresh Air!,"In this day and age of political correctness and the accompanying deadly seriousness with which we too often take ourselves, it just plain wonderful to laugh out loud at the pranks and mischievous things boys do, as chronicled in ""Up to No Good."" Cheers to Harmon for compiling them and to Gilson for her terrific photos! I applaud mischievous imagination over video games which simulate a frightening violence."
4,Enjoy & Share It,"This is hilarious! I grew up with two brothers and these stories are ""spot on"". I only gave the book 4 stars because there are so many missing stories... I've given this book to several people and also just shared it with many friends. Every grown man that reads the book is immediately prompted to share his own stories. There should be a sequel..."
1,"cruelty isn't ""naughty""","I'd already added this book to my shopping cart when I started looking at some of the pages and took it out. I'm not an animal-rights activist. I eat meat. But teasing humans, who might actually have a sense of humor, falls in a different moral category than killing animals because you can. No, I don't want to buy this for my nephew. Thank God I had daughters."
1,A Piece of Crap,"This band is the worst piece of crap I ever heard. Somehow they manage to combine masterbatory guitar ""riffs"" with the most bland production short of Air Supply. The songs have no melodies and the noises they spit out are worse than a Poison acoustic track. I was sorely disappointed. Give me Lou Reed or Kiss any day, not this piece of mule dung pretending to be ""rock and roll""."
2,Everybody wears 'em and I can't figure out why.,"I lived and worked in outdoor jobs at a ski area for 15 years and wore these every day every winter. Still can't figure out why. Even with a second set of liners to get a dry boot each day they were never particularly warm, always soggy on the inside and offer no support. My feet were always killing me by the end of the day. I now do similar work in Northeastern Nevada with much colder winters and have switched to a good quality insulated waterproof boot. They are always dry and warm, dry out much better overnight and the support and sturdyness of a leather boot is unmatched. If you really need the coolness factor I guess these will do but a good leather boot is a much better choice."
2,Way too bulky,"Bought it to wear it in cold winter days/snow days but its way to bulky. Its as if I'm wearing my snowboard boots. Can't bend my ankles. The top is so wide I have to wear wide leg baggy pants for my jeans to cover the boots. This version is like for the extreme snow, I think Sorel sells a lighter one with a thinner sole which should be more adequate for daily winter use. Returned it right away."
5,I've had mine for over 30 years.,"I just checked in to see the price of Sorel winter boots. I bought my first and only pair about 30 years ago. At that time they were ranked as the best winter boot. They cost me about $60 then and were the most expensive item of clothing I had ever bought, I think.Anyway, after 30 years in the US Air Force (England, Germany, Turkey, Alabama, Virginia, Texas, North Dakota), I have carried them with me and used them whenever needed.They are still in perfect condition. I'm spending the winter of 2010 in Boston, Massachusetts, (another snowfall last night) and these boots are perfect. I leave them outside on the porch, and when I'm ready to go out in the morning, I simply slip them on in my stocking feet. Big loops for the laces, and big laces, easy to tie, and I'm on my way.If you want the best winter boot out there, let me know if you think there is one better than the Sorel."
4,This Is Great!,"Plain and simple this DVD is worth more than 10 bucks. These matches are all from the past year and a half and should have been on this DVD. They showcased 2 versions of the most original & innovative match in the past copule of years...the Ultimate X match, which was a big plus, and showed some great athleticism which was an even bigger plus. The best thing about this DVD is a informative interview with Jerry Lynn about his career.TNA really scored a touchdown on this DVD, I hope Volume 2 is just as good, but with most of the DVD featuring matches from Impact I highly guarentee it. If this truly is the best of this division, then this is one amazing division."
5,X Division,"You may be asking what is the X Division? Well it is fresh, interesting, awesome, innovative, incredible, breathtaking, fantastic, energetic, excellent, extraordinary, outstanding, spectacular, superb, wicked and simply phenomenal.The matches on this DVD are great and if you are a wrestling fan this DVD is a must buy."
5,Nice fat cable clips at a good price.,"As a ham operator with an antenna forest outside of the house, I have cable tidiness issues. Or, more accurately, the XYL has tidiness issues. The smaller clips won't handle coax like the LMR400 and the like, so I figured I'd try this double-RG6 clip and it works fine on the fatties. I'm happy, the wife is happy, the house is happy, and the OM at the other end of the QSO is happy. Everybody's happy. Life should always be this easy."
5,"OK, so they aren't going to discontinue this product.","Originally I had heard that they were discontinuing this product. I'm glad that they haven't, I use it instead of regular to add the extra little piece of mind that my engine will last longer. I have had wonderful success in all of my GM vehicles and try not to use anything but this. Seems to keep things running very well."
4,Peyton Manning Authentic Jersey Size 54,I ordered a Peyton Manning Authentic Jersey. I received the Jersey promptly. I was very happy the I could get a Peyton Manning Authentic Jersey for such a low cost. It was clean and in great shape. My only problem that made me a little unhappy was there were some frayed threads around the numbers on the front and back of the jersey. My wife trimmed it up and I love it!
3,Not for the Long Haul,"The Igloo Natural Ice Pack for coolers works great for short trips or for a lunch box to keep your lunch cool until you can eat it. I tried it on a weekend camping trip and it was useless after not even a day. I won't bother taking it camping again. I do use it for grocery shopping trips when I plan to do other shopping afterwards. It helps keep all the lunchmeats, butter, etc. cool until I make it home."
2,Does not last long,PROS: You can cut the cubes down to sizes that are manageable for whatever cooler you are using.CONS: Don't expect these packs to stay frozen for very long. My guess is 2 hours tops.Will have to look at other options to keep my baby's formula cold.
2,"Definitely not,""One For The Road""","Previously had American DJ version of this product,very similar,but not as many features. Now don't get me wrong,I like alot of Chauvet products and they have improved over the years,but this one could not handle the workings of a mobile DJ. My previous controller lasted me over 2 1/2 years and I used it alot! The Chauvet piece lasted just over 1 year(should have gotten service contract)it came apart several times and after last repair,it just stopped working. Now I did'nt beat the s#*^t out of it,but it was for a mobile set up. I would have to say that if you install it in a permanant location you would probably get more out of it,but I'm amazed by all the positive reviews I see on it,oh well maybe mine was made on friday afternoon,but I will not purchase another one like this again."
2,disappointing,"Nice pictures but pretty lame as a guide book. Very little in the way of useful information. Go with Roadtrip USA's ""California and the Southwest."" A GREAT book."
5,sacrificed food $ for this scent!,"In January I found a magazine with a paper sample of Euphoria intact. I scrubbed my hair and clothes with this. Everywhere I went people would ask what that wonderful smell was. I could still smell it on my coat days later. So even though I was up to my ears in Christmas debt I splurged on a $59.00 bottle. It is a work of art to the eyes as the bottle itself is magnificent and a valium to the nerves with it's relaxing scent. I keep it close even at work. Oh wait, no it sucks...don't buy it because I want to be the only woman that smells that good."
4,One of my favorite's still,This is probably in the top 3 perfumes for me that my wife wears consistently. Somebody in another review mentioned that the scent seems to disappear earlier than in the past. I've sort of thought the same thing but at the same time I'm sure there is something to be said for your nose just getting used to certain scents. I'm a fan of finding a few perfumes/colognes you like and then just mixing up what you wear that day and matching it to your mood and activity for the day. This seems to help some in the notice factor for what you smell?????
1,Not the Same!,"It does NOT smell the same as the bottle I purchased from Younkers! It does not have the last effecting or the fresh smell! It does not meet my expectations and I would not recommend purchasing this item. However, Amazon quickly responded by refunding my purchase :)"
1,"Beautiful Fragrance, BUT.....","Euphoria is one of the most beautiful fragrances I've tried in a long time. The scent is simliar to Chanel's Chance, which I absolutely love. It's soft yet somewhat sophisticated. So why only one star? It doesn't last. I sprayed on a generous amount and half an hour later could barely detect a hint of the fragrance, even when holding my wrist directly under my nose. I repeated this experiment (since I had bought the bottle) several days in a row, always with the same result.Bottom line is that Euphoria, while a great fragrance, has very poor staying quality and at its price is not a good value."
3,overcharged,"When I ordered this, the price was $54.81. The billing statement enclosed with the shipment shows total price as $54.81, however, my VISA was charged $59.79. I sent an email on 8/9/11 regarding this overcharge and the reply I got was a request to review this product. I'm replyig in this manner since I cant find a phone number to call. Please inform the proper department of my complaint. Shirley"
1,Deeply Disappointed,"I, too, purchase this calendar every year for my sister, a Master Gardener. It's become a tradition, which she reminds me of every November, by handing me a beautiful page from her current year's calendar. She was very disappointed and I was shocked and embarrassed to discover the change in format. What's a gardening calendar without photographs? And how sly, even sleazy, of the publisher to package the calendar so deceptively, with no mention of the change in format.We'll have to start a new tradition with another calendar next year, unless the publisher returns to the photograph format."
1,Disappointed!,"Every year my daughter-in-law gives me this calendar and I love it so, I bought some myself this year to give as gifts...How disappointed I was when I opened it yesterday to find all writing and NO photos...I saved those photos for garden ideas and also passed the ones I did not save to a gardener friend. After all these years of loving and buying this calendar, I will not buy it again if this is the format Barbara is going to use in the future. What a bummer!!!!"
1,I'm Disappointed!,I look forward each day to the beautiful pictures on this calendar. Was I disappointed to find the format changed and it no longer contained the beautiful photos. I hope B. Damrosch will receive all this negative feedback and consider changing back to her previously successful format.
3,My Miniature Schnauzer loves it,"My MS loves this toy although he fairly quickly ripped off the nose and leg and pulled out all the stuffing. But he's played with the fox ""pelt"" for three years. It's still his favorite and kind of his ""Binky"", when we come home he'll usually greet us with it. It's about to fall into three pieces so I'm looking to buy him a new one."
4,It's Okay,"It's an okay, run-of-the-mill DBZ game. You fight and kick people's tail; that about sums up every DBZ game up. One thing I wasn't fond of was that fact that the story mode follows the movies, which I never watched because I'm just not a big fan of DBZ movies (I'm just a show fan). Still, it's a good game for the PSP with excellent graphics and pretty good sound effects. You get a pretty varied amount of characters to play as and it's not overly difficult, though there were a few levels I had to play more than once to beat. I'd recommend it to any DBZ fan, though probably not to any gamer looking for a challenge. Fun for some time-killing and easy-going butt-kicking."
2,Dissapointed,"This book features few photos I found impressive, Adams is amazing this book is a sad display of his worst work."
4,pretty good,"this cd is pretty good, disc number two is better than number one. Don Omar, Victor Manuelle and daddy yankee are on the second cd. mmmmmmy favorite song is (morena) y (ay amor)con Victor Manuelle."
2,"It is an k CD, defenetly not worth the amount ask for.","I thought this CD was k, defenetly not worth what I paid for it. It has like 4 good songs in the entire 2 albums. I do not recommend it. I would defenetly recommend Dando Cocotazos by Speedy."
3,Too Much 'Trial & Error' ... Visual Aids Needed,"My wife and I are new to cooking with Waterless/Greaseless cookware. We got the book as part of a recommended bundle via Amazon. The book is an excellent textbook for learning how to use the cookware, but it lacks the one thing that keeps it from being truly helpful ... There are no photo's of any dish in various stages, No photo's which example common errors such as, cooking at too high a temp, too low a temp, or what size is the best size for cutting the potato to get it to cook thoroughly.I still recommend people who are new to cooking with waterless/greaseless cookware to get this book, because it does give you a point at which to begin and then supplement it with 'Cooking with Waterless Cookware' videos from YouTube."
3,Disgruntled,I did not find this book helpful cooking with SS cookware. The generic recipes are available all over the internet and are not cookware specific. Save your money. It's overpriced and overrated.
3,god product at a fair price,I have used purolator air filters for over 30 years and they make a good quality product.I believe that purolator products are equal to quality to fram products and at a lower price.Just don't be foolish enough to purchase any automotive filter made in China regradless of the price.You do in most instances get what you pay for!
1,The Title Says It All,"Great first book, The RM was great, but this is just the half-hearted ranting of an overrated crybaby. Obviously, Goad is a man with only one book in him, given underground credibility either b/c he spent time in prison for beating his wife or because he lives in Portland, sucking off the warm dung-squirting teat of Chuck Palahniuk."
3,Misleading product description.,Product description misleading. Don't buy this if your truck is newer than 2002. The same manufacturer makes a different kit that fits 2003 Silverado. Quality is nice as the other reviewer said.
5,Beautiful,"I think this is a treasure everyone needs to see. I found it uplifting, inspiring and eye-opening.If only all people on this planet would understand the message Loiuse Hay has to transmit... the world would be a better place for everyone. The power we have as people is grand, and it's a shame most go through life not realizing this...I just wish it wasn't that expensive to buy, otherwise I wold have bought one for all my friends..."
4,Louise Hay is a gift to the world.,"I enjoyed this book, especially because Louise Hay refers to her own life and healing in order to help us understand our own."
2,Long Winded,Buy this becuase your intrested and not curious. She gets long winded at times and does become a little boring.
3,Get the EXPANDED version,"I much prefer the DVD of THE SECRET. However, there is good information here as well. Specifically, in the second disc of the expanded version. The second disc has the complete interviews that are interspersed as fragments in the ""movie"" that is disc 1. If you're going to purchase the DVD, please do yourself a favor and purchase the EXPANDED version."
3,WHY SO HIGH PRICED ?,"I'M SICK OF GURUS WHO WANT TO ""HELP"" PEOPLE AND THEN NAIL THEM WITH A $30.00DVD {SOMETIMES MORE}OR BOOK."
3,"Excellent content, questions on technical execution- no CC?","No qualms about recommending the wonderful content of this DVD, however, I was really hampered by the lack of closed captioning (??) available (or at least I couldn't get it to work on my system).I found that the closed captioning would have been useful: while the audio quality of the interviews in the documentary were just fine, the narration by the female 'character' was so breathy /whispery /full of verbal 'tics & clicks' that I often couldn't make out what she was saying! That was frustrating, because I wanted to hear it, but often just fast-forwarded through 'her' sections to be able to keep a positive spirit while viewing the DVD.The 'tics and clicks' lady would have been more tolerable if closed captioning were available. The lack of closed captioning on this DVD really surprises me, as I would think that Hay House would consider the needs of the hearing-impaired.Still recommended!"
5,Watch This DVD and Watch the Healing Begin,"This film is a good tool to start the healing in your own life. Louise Hay is the pioneer of the ""heal your life"" movement. In this CD, you not only hear from Louise directly, but from so many of modern day practioners (Cheryl Richardson, Doreen Virtue, Gregg Braden, Wayne Dyer, Caroline Myss, and many others). If you are ready to heal yourself -- and that means looking inward, folks -- this is a very good tool. You still have to do the work yourself, but Louise (and friends) show you how to take those first steps."
3,When Greek gods were mediocre . . .,"Very Post-Modern! It's an original take on the traditional story theme of man vs. gods. The gods only exist because humanity worships them. If we don't worship them, then the gods will presumably die, though they don't necessarily say this. So humanity makes a war on the gods and stops worshiping them. In comes our hero, who is part-god but wishes to deny that reality. The special effects are better than the original, but I got to say, I enjoy the original still better. All in all, it is entertaining . . ."
2,Disappointing; skip this movie,"I was pumped up and excited to watch Clash of the Titans after watching what seemed to be an epic trailer. I thought Sam Worthington can make any movie spectacular. I was dead wrong.The script and dialogue put me to sleep. Not even Sam Worthington nor Liam Neeson (He did fine as Zeus) could save the movie. The directions and pace of the movie was a lullaby. Me and a few friends actually fell asleep half way through the movie.The monsters and giants were well done. But, they had no character and died off far too easily. There was no challenge. No obstacle. It felt like a walk in the park.Do yourself a favor and skip this movie."
1,Drunken Monkey Knife Fight (the director's cut!),"They might as well remake ""The Godfather"" and cast the Jonas brothers in the lead roles. Just slap a few million $ worth of CGI on it and break out the 3D glasses! Hell, just remake Avatar already!*Warning: Do not use if you have herpes viral infection of the eyeball."
1,Major plot change for the worse,"This film is beautifully produced, but be advised there is a major change in plot and attitude from the original. The original film captured the classical relationship between mortals and the Gods as exists through out Greek Mythology. The new film replaces that with pure modern anti-God hatred. Zeus is no longer concerned with justice tempered by a love for his own family. Now he's just a parasite on mankind. As a Christian and a classical scholar I was deeply offended by this treatment of the Greek deities especially as it was clear to me the director had turned this story into a piece of atheist propaganda. Accordingly this is the first film I walked out on in thirty years. If you love God, Greek Mythology, or the first film, avoid this film like the plague. One star is too high a rating."
3,Never saw the movie and don't need to now,Since we inevitably have some verbose gasbag writing paragraphs giving the entire plot of the movie and their learned opinion of it.Let's all do each other a favor and knock off giving the plot away.
5,one of the few great remakes!,"very good cgi in this one, a great remake. though not a long movie compared with others now, seeing how most are well over 2 hours, and this falls shy of that mark. but overall very very good"
5,TITANS!!!,"I loved 300, so it was no surprise that I loved Clash of the Titans. It looks great on bluray and the action was cool. The CGI was really well done, can't comment on the 3d version cause I have read that out really sucked so I didn't even bother with it. Great all around fighting flick, check it out and sit back and enjoy!"
2,Disappointed,What a huge disappointment. The special effects and the first movie (with Harry Hamlin) attracted me to this movie. But the bad script and the bad acting really surprised me. I couldn't wait for this movie to end and I will not watch it again. I suggest that you watch the original - much more fun and a hotter leading man!
5,Doesn't disappoint!!,What can you say about a classic? Appreciate it!! This is such a good film. Even the giant scorpions are great!! Add this to your collection of classic films...
3,Some very good effects,"Some great visuals, especially with the Kraken and the giant scorpions, though not much of a story here. Decent action and adventure that will entertain you briefly. There is not much else to say."
3,CLASH OF THE TITANS 2010,"IT WAS AN OKAY MOVIE, NOT MUCH OF A STORY LINE. BETTER SPECIAL AFFECTS THAN THE OLD FILM WITH HARRY HAMLIN. BUT AS I SAID THE STORY LINE WAS POOR."
4,Remake repairs.,This was a worthy remake of a classic adventure. Many remakes muddy up the previous version without improvement. This remake is at least as close to the last in the special effects relm. It creates new effects to rival any movie James Cameron did not make. A good exciting evening is in store for all. Enjoy
2,Meanders around and never lands,"Everybody I knew that saw ""Clash of the Titans"" in the theater said that the problem was the bad 3D. Having just watched it on home video, I think that it has a lot more problems than that. I thought Sam Worthington was cardboard, that the plot didn't make that much sense and that it just never got that interesting. At the end of the day, Perseus has to quest all over to find a way to defeat the Kraken because the gods have given the humans an ultimatum, but it's just a weapon of Hades, who he didn't defeat. Even worse, I was pretty sure throughout the movie that Zeus was a bad guy, but at the end I think the filmmakers want us to think he's good. It doesn't work. Two stars."
3,Uneccesary Product Packaging,"Everyone has shared their opinion of the movie, but I don't understand the growing trend for Blu-Ray's to be released with a DVD and digital copy. I could maybe understand the Digital Copy, but why the DVD? If someone is buying the Blu-Ray, why would they EVER watch the DVD version? They charge $16.99 for the DVD itself, but its thrown in this package as filler. At least have a product version where its only the Blu-Ray and sell it for less. Its a waste of materials and resources to include it with the Blu-Ray. Thats like throwing in a Ford Focus if you buy a Mercedes."
2,This movies blows,the CGI was good. But the rest of this movie Blows. Go see the original its way better than this! one was. But don't wast you money on this one!
3,Expected More,"Alright...I love this movie. Honestly,I do..but here's my problem. Perseus was made to look like a total punk. I mean,he whined a lot and almost everyone did the fighting for him. The only reason he's a hero is the few bits that he did come out ahead (ex. when he got the eye from the witches,killed Medusa). Other then that,he didn't do much for me as far as mythic heroes go. I thought Sam Worthington was great but I wish he had more of a story as Perseus. That's really my only big problem. Oh...and what's with that creeper in the Toga and funky hair? That dude was creepy as all hell and a total zealot...just pure psycho. Other then that,I loved this movie...it's definitely one to see,I just wish there was a lot more story and epic moments to it."
4,blu-ray review,"im a huge fan of the original, hollywood does greek mythology. great story there, the best haryhausen ever. didnt catch the 3d version, but im pretty happy with my blu-ray, its pretty damn crisp. and i like it, it puts the whole story into a deeper base, and i think its well done.my only gripe is the tendency to try to 'overpack' the action scenes, much like the transformer movies, theres just too much going on, im just a mere mortal, i can only comprehend so much visually. i end up knowing that something took place, what exactly, i couldn't tell you. why would you spend so much time and effort to produce a blurry, mediocre action sequence? i know somebody hit somebody with a sword, or something, but for zues'sake let me see it."
3,It was slightly entertaining,"Did not follow the original movie as I thought it would. I was not expecting a masterpiece, so I was not as disappointed as others. I found it slightly entertaining, but I would rather watch the original. They are both cheesy, but the first one has nostalgia."
3,Clash of the Titans - compare,"I have reviewed both the new and old version of Clash of the Titans. I found thenew version full of good CG animation, but I found that the story line was easier to follow in the old version. I did like the connection to the old movieby showing the mechanical owl. All in all, I prefer the old version.MLN"
1,Nasty customer service,"If they mess up your order like they did mine, don't expect any help or even sympathy."
1,STRUCTURAL STEEL DRAFTING,Amazon messed up the shipping address and Zip Code I never received the product.Instead of contacting me I got an automatic message they were refunding my money.
5,Everything it boasts,This is a great framework for those who are seeing clients for better mental health issues. It shows how clinicians can take various therapuetic approaches and use them to enlarge the capactiy for clients to reach a higher understanding of their experiences.
2,Like J.K. Rowling... without the imagination or characters,"Very two-dimensional. Sage's history of writing picture books is evident in both the writing style and character development. The plot elements are plagarized and don't really hang together well. The climax and denouement don't provide any satisfying drama or surprise. The book would work for poor middle school readers or good ones in the early grades, but I wouldn't recommend it for smart tweens."
5,Surprisingly addictive,"I was a bit apprehensive about getting this book, thinking it would just be another Harry Potter knockoff. I was pleasantly surprised by the original story and found myself falling in love with the characters and their unique quirks and personalities. I was sad to have finished it so quickly, but will be getting the next book very soon.This book is great for kids of all ages as well as adults who enjoy a good fantasy story."
4,"A Fun Read, albeit Simplistic","I am an adult fan of young adult/children's books. I really enjoyed this book but it is very simplistic and predictable.Sage develops a very interesting world with characters that you want to know more about. What I assume are supposed to be surprises, however, are quite transparent and I doubt even the youngest readers would be caught off guard when they are revealed.I still highly recommend this book and I am looking forward to the next in the series. I see the book suggested for 9-12 and that is a very appropriate group. I think an advanced 8 year old reader would also find this very interesting and anyone who is a fan of fantasy might find it a delightful quick perusal."
5,"Amazing , Just Amazing","I loved it! Quit comparing books to Harry Potter just because they are in the same genre. This is much better anyways. Though the identity of the real Septimus was almost obvious, I found it fun to see the characters get it wrong. This will be a New York Times Best Seller, I guarantee it."
3,"Ok, not great","The author's style is unpractised and leaves *far* too many holes and gaps in the storyline as well as loose ends. I found myself wondering what happened to some things that were brought up and never addressed by the end and flipping back in the book to figure out contradictions at other points. At times the writing style strangely even aspires to be akin to AA Milne, but fails. The writing style did improve slightly about two thirds of the way through. All considered I find that the style and the discontinuity prevent me from recommending this book to others."
4,Second Chance Made it good,"This is an enjoyable read - I have seen the reviews about the lack of originality, which I totally disagree - everything that is written takes its ideas from what has existed before, but it is the presentation that makes the difference - there needs to be enough of what has gone before to have the comfort of familiar but enough new to wonder and want to know what happens next - this does that beautifully and I will continue the series - my only complaint is the final chapter with the were are they now - it is unique in that minor characters are given a few paragraphs of, Oh Yeah by the Way, but I skipped it - the wonder is part of the fun to me - over all, this is a great read"
5,Compelling. Fascinating. Vivid.,"Right away, you will find yourself drawn into the story and you will find that you quickly develop a vested interest in what happens to the characters. - This is a compelling story. I finished the book only moments ago and feel as if I was a part of the adventure.M. Camp, Author ofRelevantly Random"
2,defective binding,"I bought this book for my son. He is ten and was enjoying the book on a long car trip until it jumped from page 308 backwards to 245. It continued through 276 and then jumped to 341. Pages 309-340 are missing. Amazon has mailed a replacement copy. Review will be updated when he reads it. It is disappointing that a defective book was sold. I would guess there are others out there, so check carefully if you make a new purchase."
1,"as a teacher, i implore you not to buy into this HACK series","Really Sage, try harder to be rowling and tolkien. You have failed. I only bought this book because it was cheaper on Kindle. The most boring book I have ever read. I was able to skip the last 45% of the book. Just to find out the answer to the mystery was what I knew as soon as the boy showed up. I dont know what warrented this series to go on so long, but I feel bad for those who should realize their time has been wasted."
4,Good Fantasy Novel,"I got this book as a free choice for my Kindle, and I was hooked from the first chapter. It is well written, easy to follow, and was hard to put down. I will definitely be purchasing the rest of this series!"
1,Interesting but not that much,"Empire of care is not an argumentative book. The author only goal is to define the context in which Pilipino nurses migrated to the US. The problem is in her attempt to leave the decision to the reader on rather or not the US was a good or bad influence on the Philippines she does not give enough background information about the history of America's and the Philippines' relationship to draw anything from unless you are already familiar w/ the topic. If you want info about the Philippines, US imperialism, migration, or related topics pick another book."
1,sorry I wasted my time on this one!!,One of the worst movies I ever watched!! Jay North must have been in financial need !!! Don't waste your money and time on this one!!
4,Of Men and Numbers,"Of Men and Numbers narrates the stories of the greatest known mathematicians that lived - their lives, personalities, struggles, faith, and inventions, while unraveling the fascinating evolution of mathematics to date. Mathematics that started as a study of quantities has morphed into a 'science that draws necessary conclusions based on reason and logic'. Whether the basis for this reason and logic is 'firm' or not is the question that modern day mathematicians are trying to answer. As Einstein put it, ""So far as the theorems of mathematics are about reality, they are not certain; so far as they are certain, they are not about reality""."
2,Not what I expected.,I dontated this book. Hopefully someone will like it but I didn't. It is boring.
1,Wrong Yoda!!,"This is the second time I find this Yoda (the Yoda in the picture holding a staff) on Amazon and purchase it. This is the second time I receive the Yoda holding a lightsaber. Which is clearly not the Yoda you have pictured! Unfair. I don't want the Yoda with the lightsaber, it's ugly!! False advertisement. :( Not remotely happy with my purchase. Change the picture!!!"
3,You should rent the game before buying it.,This isn't a bad game but there are some gliches. The load times are long and it takes forever to do any team changing. The game isn't for married people with kids. I don't have as much time to play as I did when I was single and kidless. I have about an hour to play a day and this game takes much longer than that to get through a week. I sim some of the tasks but it bites me in the butt because I didn't get to do what I wanted; instead the computer does. Take away the long load times and let me do more than 2 changes at a time and this might be a great game.
3,Poor warranty coverage,Beware of Casio warranty coverage. In less than one year three small screws fell out of the base of the camera causing the case to open and allowing dirt and dust into the camera body. The lens jammed. Casio refuses to honor it's warrany saying that it is not a manufacturer's defect. I caution you before you purchase any casio products. Check out ebay and see how many of these used and defective cameras are up for sale.
3,slim and light and functional,"for its price and size, it is an OK camera which produces OK pictures.however, in my opinion, i've seen better picture/color quality with canon ixus and sony w-series."
2,"Good for snapshots, not much more","Well, the stats look great on this camera but the image quality is not very good. I'd say inconsistent at best. Sometimes I get fairly good photos that I'd rate an 8 out of 10, about half the time though the shots are just [...]. The zoom is useless. It pixelates so badly and blurs to on the slightest zoom. The zoom is truely unuseable. The software to transfer photos from the camera to the computer works well but constantly pops up these annoying error messages that don't seem to relate to any actuall functional errors.I'd say it would be a good deal if it was only [...] not worth it unless you just want something that looks good physically."
4,"Nice camera, dodgy battery","The camera is very nice - for pics and short movies - but the battery died after 6 months. Casio has it back now, and I am waiting for a replacement under their warranty"
1,Easy to use - drop it two feet and its useless,The camera was fine until it dropped two feet. The drop killed it and repairs are too expensive to make them worthwhile.I wish it was more sturdy. Other digital cameras I own have been more durable.
4,a great introduction,"Many have tried to write an introduction to anime in the past, but Drazen's is the first to really give a good sense of the staggering breadth of the anime field. He covers a lot of ground and demonstrates an in-depth knowledge of the background *behind* anime. A little copy-eding would not have gone a miss though; one passage implies that Jubei Yagyu was one of the Seven Samurai! Still an excellent intro to anime though, and an ideal stepping stone for climbing on to Stone Bridge's lofty Anime Encyclopedia."
3,Too much detail and generalziation,"The book is fair quality. Drazen has a point of view and follows it to the end. Two problems are noted, 1) his history references need to be more varied (keeps quoting one source), 2) oversimplification of some basic facts of Japanese culture/religion. Be prepared for alot of manga reference in addtion to anime material. Also half the book is reviews of Anime."
5,He's her new best friend,"Teddy, as he has since been christened, is my 3yo girls best friend. He goes everywhere with us from morning until bed. He is very soft and a dark enough shade that he does not show every speck of dirt he encounters. He is super cute and looks like a teddy bear- not too cutesy and not too actual wild bear like-- just right.I wish he were machine washable, but I'd worry he'd lose the super soft texture. He seems well sewn and I have only seen a few stray tufts of hair (maybe loose from manufacture? they have tapered off since the first week he was here)He's a great size (though big!) for my little girl to haul around and snuggle."
4,A fresh voice and sound. You best give this one a listen.,"The lyrics are what caught my attention. No doubt about it. Before the first note played, I read through them and was immediately taken by the imagery. The better surprise came from the ethereal voice of Stacy Wray. She rides each song with a uniqueness or originality that is lost on most independent releases. ""Sinking Down"" is marvelous. ""Sucked In"" with its grand percussive build up kept this drummer's attention and turned into an awesome finale. Buy this CD. It works!"
1,Carmen is...Improved!,"Carmen would've been a laughing stock if she would've asked for a record deal when season 2 had ended, her voice wasn't up to par. She has very much improved since then, but not very good. Her songs sound just like every other pop singer, pleasing, yet forgettable. There is nothing unique or difinative about her voice and i don't think there ever will be until she realizes what inside her she wants to show in her voice."
1,Save your money!,"No idea how Carmen ever made it to the top 12, because she has the voice of a goat. This CD has terrible vocals, and not every person on AI should be making CDs. Stop while you can."
3,Manufacturing Defect,"I discovered that the new ironing board would not collapse for storage. One of the folding legs should move in a channel on the bottom of the board. One side of the leg was properly inserted in the channel, but the other was not. I was able to make repairs, and am otherwise happy with my purchase."
2,Ironing Board,"This product had a rough start with me. I was sent the wrong color of ironing board. When I contacted the seller, they told me there was no way for them to ensure I got the color I wanted. The ironing board I had previously was about 25 years old, so ANY ironing board was an upgrade! However, this ironing board is not as awesome as I was excepting. It is rather hard to get the legs of the board down. And they tend to fall down once you store the ironing board. The board was also a bit short...and I'm only 5'6""! Also, the cover the of board was scorched after its first use and the cover was so hot that I burned my hand twice. Steam is constantly coming up from the ironing board. My neighbor has an ironing board from Target that is much better than this one. I am grateful to have a new ironing board, but I don't see this one having a long life."
4,family fun,"Tumblin Monkeys is a very fun game, for adults and children alike. My daughter enjoys the whole process, setting up the palm tree, piercing/poking it with the sticks, placing the monkeys inside, and watching them swing on to the sticks by their tails. Then comes the actual game, and it is casual and easy and fun, and always brings laughter to all who are playing.I have just once issue with this game, the twirling color wheel which replaces the die, does not spin very well, so I had to create a makeshift die instead.The large original Tumblin Monkeys is best, however when you have to travel, or you don't have much space at home, this mini version is also great."
5,Great Collection Of Tales For Teens!,"This is *not* an outdated collection, though published in 1999; many readers will actually delight in recalling ""how we felt"" as the old century/millenium ticked away. Written by an assortment of the finest writers for young adults today, no serious collection for teens should be without it. Just the stories by L'Engle and Peck make it worth the read."
5,"Excellent book worth every penny, inspirational, Jim Hrisoulas is the MAN!!","HE tells you how to do things properly, not half @$$ed, if you omitted half of his steps you could still have beautiful blades with practice. This book is essential for beginning knifemakers!!"
3,A bit tight,"I am a huge Clarks Booty fan. This one I am not so sure. The suede feels soft and comfortable.The rubber bottom feels good. But, lately I'm feeling a slight pain on the top of my right foot. Could be from the upper stiching.I am a size 8 and I purchased an 8 1/2, maybe a 9 would have been better. I'll keep trying to stretch it.So, it gets a 3 star for now."
4,Dark Stuff,"When I read a review stating that this CD was like a trip through Hell, I was intrigued. I bought, I listened and I LOVE! However for those of you who are new to ambient you have to keep in mind that ambient is background music: you either focus all of your attention into the production letting the music take you on a trip into your own imagination or you put it on to have something playing. Ambient isn't just something you can mosh to, get jiggy w/ or play @ your pool party. I love where Brian Williams takes you with all of these chilling tones. In retrospect of all of his other work I have heard (The Monstrous Soul & Purifying Fire) this is the only album you'll need to get the best expirence of Williams' work. All other albums seem to be very very similar to this one, yet Heresy has a little umph to it to make it more unique than the rest."
1,buyer beware,after research on amazon's own website i ordered these filters for a specific car. when the filters arrived i inspected them and found the would not fit the vehicle they were ordered for
1,Price without Quality,"Bought this starter at BBQ's Galore for it's large capacity and hefty feel. After three uses the rivets popped out of the sides that hold the grate, I assume from the weight of a full load of charcoal and high heat. The ""heat resistant paint"" flaked off and the inside rusted despite a dry summer in San Diego. The bottom sagged, I had to drill and screw sheet metal screws into the bottom grate to get a few more uses from this ill made expensive mistake. I borrowed a friends Weber that he's had for 5 years and it is a much better product. The chimmeny effect does work but barely with this poorly designed product. Get the Weber, I just ordered mine from Amazon. I may buy three (BBQ Gifts) for the price of this wretched device."
5,Glorious!,"Seldom do you see a book with pictures that make you gasp with wonder at their glorious beauty. If you have an appreciation of sacred beauty, you will marvel, page after breathtaking page. Some of my favorite English cathedrals are featured. From these pictures I was able to enjoy many of the finer details that you cannot grasp in person, craning your neck at the magnificent vaulted ceilings. What wonder man created with the Lord's inspiration!"
3,An interesting little EP...,"This album is decent, and one of the best songs (Devil May Care) is available on 'Unlimited', which is Susperia's best album. If you are really into Susperia, then you should get this. I'm glad I picked up, but if you are new to the band, then this is not the best place to start. To the best of my knowledge, 'Lack of Comprehension' is only available in this EP, and is a phenomenal song, so you might want to pick it up just for that song. The other songs are good, but this is not Susperia's best."
3,Ya gotta' love guys in rubber suits fighting...,"Used to love this when I was kid. Still kinda' fun, but hard to watch more than a couple of episodes at a time. This also had the original Japanese language version with new subtitles as well as the American dubbed version by the same voice talent as Speed Racer"
3,new subtitals and bad sound tracks,"i noticed that the subtitals are new in one of the episoded it says ""that sucks"" that wasn't said in the 60's or 70's and the subtital story isn't the same story as the actors are telling.the languages were actually changing on their own like they are crossed tracks but the picture quality wasn't bad.also if you are a godzilla fan the last episode on disc one has godzilla in it they took zilla put a hood on his neck and called him something else but it was godzilla with a lizard hood added to it.if ya got capability to change sound with your remote then the language changing isn't too bad ya just keep your finger ready to change the language."
2,ultraman complete.,"this is a great series if they would put in english, go back and fix it. and do all of the ultraman series in english people will buy if you do that."
4,Ultraman: the Complete Series,"Reasonably priced with a quick delivery. Again, I enjoyed watching this series on TV with my son in the early '80's and will now watch it with my grandson."
3,The Howling Stones by Alan Dean Foster,The premis of the book was good. At one point well into the story Foster get carried away his philosophy on good and evil which kind of drags. Otherwise this is a good story.
5,Awesome Cookbook!,"I absolutely love this cookbook. I have about six other vegan cookbooks, but none compare to this one. It has wonderful, flavorful recipes that use many fresh vegetables and spices. The recipes are creative and colorful. No ""meat substitutes"" are used. Includes nutritional information. I highly recommend this to anyone, vegan or omnivore."
3,It's OK,This book is mediocre. I bought it as a gift with another vegan cookbook. I was not overly impressed with this one but I hope my vegan friend finds some stuff she likes.
1,Poorly laid out,I thought this book was too confusing and not laid out very well ~~~2 columns on each page and the recipes not divided by the pages and no pictures. I gave the book to my sister. Maybe I'm just simple minded and don't want to work too hard to figure out what the recipes are saying. Good luck and hope you enjoy the book if you buy it.
4,Handy,"Everyone should have a roll or 2 around, it's just so handy. I wrap all my extension cords and powertool cables with it and keep a roll in the truck, you never know."
4,Better solution than cable ties,"I sewed on two strips of the Velcro to my backpack style camera bag so I can easily carry my tripod. It worked great for that and I have a ton left over to use for cable ties or anything else. I like that you can cut to the length you need without any waste, and the added 1/4"" in width makes it much stronger than the 1/2"" wide rolls."
4,Good for the price,"The roll is ok for the price, it doesn't adhere to itself as much as I hoped, but it would work fine for most uses."
3,the backing and the velcro separates,"I used these to hold on shinguard in soccer, but after a few games, the backing came off of the velcro. Would've been much better if it was one piece or if they glued it a little better."
3,Thicker than I thought,"This does what it says it does. My only issue is that the product is thicker, heavier than I expected. So I am mentioning it so you will be aware. I was expecting the type of dual sided velcro you find as a wire tie type product. This stuff is heavier, and I guess stronger, but I didn't need stronger."
1,Extreme Garbage,"This is a terrible book, because it is written in absolutely no context whatsoever. It is basically the worst, most hateful things that Muslims have written compiled into a book and presented to the West as Islam. Judging from his introduction, it is clear that the editor (Parfrey) has a vendetta against Islam and he is trying to scare the West about Islam. An analogy would be if somebody gathers up all the hateful Neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic literature in America and presents it to the East as ""America"". The author fails to mention that the views espoused in Extreme Islam are supported by a very small percentage of Muslims and there is a great movement in many Middle Eastern countries (especially Iran) against ""fundamentalism"". Secondly, Parfery takes absolutely legitimate writings about the Palestinian resistance and tries to present them as ""extreme"", thus trying to lump in the hateful writings of Khomeini with the moderate Arabs who want peace in Palestine. Disgusting."
5,"Wonderful Storyline, Plot and Charecters","I just adore this book, I almost have it memorized after many readings. Unfortunaly my baby riped it up so I need to find a new one. For anyone who is looking for a bit of interesting reading, buy it!"
4,A great fantastical story with great Goth imagery.,"From the moment when the girl begins to learn about her heritage, to the very end of the book, every single image is detailed and befitting of the story. A great read."
3,Lovely Quality But Beware of Sizing,"This is a beautiful ring and I was much delighted with it's quality. HOWEVER, the size 7 I ordered turned out to actually be a small, not-quite-size 6. I don't know if this was a fluke or if they just generally size it small. Anyway, I was hugely disappointed AND had to pay an additional $45.00 to have it resized at my jewelers. I would not purchase from this company again."
5,Extremely good book for teenage romancers.,"This Book will make you laugh and cry. Its full of wonderful love stories that make you wish you had you own Silver Beach to escape to. The carachters are so familiar to teens, that you feel very close to them. Its a combination of stories almost all teen girls can relate to. First love, Break ups, heartaches, and more. A wonderful book to complete the exquizid series. You'll be sorry thier stories are over."
1,A Disappointing Volume,Being a huge fan of HK flix I was excited to have another resource. Unfortunately this one falls way short. The reviews are confusing and insulting at times. All actresses are judged on their appearence as opposed to their acting skills and actors other than the biggest names are rarely recognized. From the information given and the blaring errors in synopsis I would guess that some movies reviewed were not even viewed!Try Bey Logan's HK Action Cinema or Sex & Zen & A bullet in the Head by Stefan Hammond & Mike Wilkins instead.
3,poorly packed,"The dvd arrived in a broken case with both dvds rattling around loosely together. They arrived with lots of scratches, and I fully intended on returning them, but thought I'd see if they worked first. I haven't watched the whole thing, but the little I did watch seemed to be working. I put them in a new case and decided to keep them. There is a lot to watch on each dvd, and the picture quality is good for how old the footage is. Overall it's a great product, they just need to add a little more protection to the package before it ships."
4,excelente la atencion y muy buen producto,Buenos dias estimado/asMuy bueno la atencion por parte del vendedor y la entrega fue perfecta a la fecha indicada el producto new y originalmuchas gracias...
3,australian slow mover,"Slow moving love story with lots of remote scenery from Western Australia, good acting by Toni Collette. A very pleasant time filler, but a little too long in the telling."
1,What is the hype about?!,"I popped in this movie, made a hot cup of chocolate (call me cliche) and plopped on the couch to watch this ""intense flick."" Expecting a new twist on romantic adventure, I was unpleasantly surprised. I sat, anticipating the moment this film would become exciting, in-depth, romantic, ANYTHING. Soon the 100 dreadful minutes were over and all I wanted was bed. It left me with nothing but the desire to never sleep with a married man, incase he might die and then I'll have to explain it to his wife? This movie was not beautiful. It was not creative. The acting was effortless. The story was underdeveloped. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, unless you want a prequel to a good nap. I have, however, never visited Australia and was thrilled with the photography. But for that, I would have given it half a star. The only option was one. I rounded up."
3,"It's interesting, but not deserving of all the awards","I enjoy Toni Collette's films, and was eager to see this film when it came out on DVD. JAPANESE STORY has received many awards in Australia, and is quite a starightforward storyline to begin with. Toni plays a geologist who is assigned to take a Japanese businessman on a trip to the Outback. At first she is reluctant, but as the trip progresses, they form quite a friendship. The film moves along at a slow pace and I must admit that I wondered if it would pick up beyongd the bogged car episode. But wait, there is an unusual twist which you do not see coming! In this scene, Toni demonstrates her fine acting style. This scene alone, although tragic, makes the film that more interesting. How life can change in a single second. After that, the film falls a bit flat, and it is almost as if the Director did not know where to go from there.JAPANESE STORY is worth a look, if anything for the beautiful scenery. But eleven awards? I don't think so."
2,"Good cinematography, otherwise forgettable","I like a lot of independent films but this one was a disappointment. The plot is jumpy and illogical in places. The romance develops abruptly and is not credible. The most powerful scenes are dragged out to the point that they become silly.Overall, not much happens in this movie and you will be just counting the minutes until it ends. The cinematography and the beautiful pictures of the Australian outback offer some redeeming value for your time, but don't expect an interesting (or believable) plot, good acting, suspense, drama, or anything else from this movie."
5,NOT just a retelling of Man Without Fear...,"Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale have now become famous for their stories placed early in a superhero's career--Batman, Spider-Man, Superman and Daredevil. Daredevil: Yellow is about Matt's early days but doesn't just go over Miller's MAN WITHOUT FEAR miniseries. As always, Tim Sale's art is brilliant and it is a must have in the increasingly large must have Daredevil library. (That library includes all of volume II of Daredevil and all of Frank Miller's stuff.)"
4,Good Replacement Filter at reasonable cost,"Replaced a Mann Filter with this one because of cost and free shipping. Fit was very firm. I think it should have more flex (cushion) to form tigher seal.Been running it for about a month, no problems to report."
5,Good source of bodubuilding!,"This book is packed with nothing but infomation. From front to back it covers all the basic understandings of the sport. From training routines to steroids, this book has got it. After reading i increased my knowlage by the truck loads. I very good book, a must buy.Check ya later,Steve Whalley(streetrod)"
4,Almost Everything You Need To Know!,"Dr. Colker's book is an eye-opening read. A lot of what I ""thought I knew"" about fitness and nutrition, he crushed! Normally, I just wouldn't believe something that went against my own knowledge, but he supports everything with science - not to mention making sense of a lot of the stuff that just wasn't working for me. My quest for my best body is on an entirely different course, now that I've read Extreme Muscle Enhancement. I've only been following the principles for about 3 weeks now and can already tell that I'm going in the right direction!"
2,Elmo Presentation camera,This camera is great for projecting an image but leaves quite a bit to be desired for taking rapid pictures. I am told that is a function of the camera not being a USB 2 device.
3,Just ok,"Sound quality is poor for speaker and mic. When i plugged it in the sound volume went to at least half of what it is without a headset and the person on the other end said ""what?"" 90% more times that usual."
3,Not Worth It.,"I owned this product for about a month. During that time it worked nominally. It fit comfortably in my ear, and didn't require holding it in as some headsets do, although I did have to readjust it once-in-a-while.However, the noise-canceling didn't work as my girlfriend could still tell I was in my car, and my biggest complaint was that at the end of the month it just decided to stop working. I plugged it in the phone, and it just gave up on life.Overall a decent product if you can get it cheap, and if it lasts more than a few weeks."
2,"Excellent incoming sound, terrible outgoing (mic) sound","Bottom line? Pretty comfortable, nice to have choice of 'ear gels'. Incoming sound is good. But, the microphone is pretty terrible. I've tried using this one on and off for about a week and a half. I've gotten comments that I sounded like I was calling from inside a ""tin can"", and when I've tested it by leaving a voicemail on my home phone, both with the headest, and just using the phone microphone, it's like night and day: with headest, I can barely (if even) understand what I'm saying...with the phone microphone, it's clear and understandable. Too bad, jabra, with a better mic, this could be a good product, but back it goes...."
2,try the jabra C150 instead,"I have tried a few earpieces on my various cell phones over the years. I bought and tried this one. There have been worse. But... this product is just not comfortable; It is also difficult to manage. The way the piece goes around the ear is clumsy, and trying to get the earpiece in while keeping the ""ear-hook"" part in place is difficult.Sound is OK if you can get all things positioned right - but it is too much of a challenge.The Jabra C150 is much more comfortable, easy to deal with and the sound is great from both ends (hearing others, and others hearing you) - I recommend that one."
1,false advertising,"Not proper size as advertized. No adaptor included. ""Knock off"" replica mailed in a zip-lock bag. Plastic was chipped on earbud. Rubber earpiece insert discolored."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This headset sucks. I have a Samsung phone with T-Mobile, and this headset was nearly completely useless. It hardly worked. It only worked if the plug was partially in with the cord wrapped in the proper direction (and even then the sound was very poor). AWFUL."
4,Jabra EarWave Boom,This is the second set I have purchased and it works great! New state law in Washington requires a hands free phone and using my Earwave is what I needed. It's not a blue tooth but I think it's a great deal for the price
5,great,"great headset, very comfortable compared to others, even other jabra headsets. no problems with hearing the other person or the other person hearing you. would recommend."
1,Not good enough,"These magnets are not strong enough to find metal backing or metal studs through 5/8"" dry wall. They can only find screw heads. If you use them daily like I do, buy stronger ones. These are going back. I hope I save somene their money!"
2,Broken after 5 minutes,"This magnets are really strong, but after 5 minutes playing with them now 3 of 4 are broken because they attract between each one so hard that it is almost imposible to avoid the crash."
2,"informative, but flawed","This books contains a collection of articles on different topics written by different authors. This is normal for the field of psychology, but it does not work so well in this volume. Some of the chapters contradict each other. And the authors vary widely in scienticity. Some of the authors cite extensive rigorous research to back up their points. Others cite theories and ideas (many of their own) instead of any of the copious amounts of research on the topic (that sometimes contradicts their ideas). The editors could have done a better job selecting chapter authors who used the same standard of research. To its credit, it does cover a wide range of topics and some of the individual chapters are very informative and well researched."
3,cheap price but cheaply made,"Installing this was easy enough but the quality of the construction left something to be desired. This was the only dash mount kit for my vehicle that i found on amazon. It works but is very fragile and bending the metal tabs for the radio cage with my fingers cracked the plastic. I would have gladly paid a little more for quality, but I'll just have to make do with what i have."
2,Cheap,The mounting brackets are cheap brittle plastic that snapped like a cookie....I wish somebody would start making high quality install brackets....I would happily pay more for a nice piece
4,The dog she wanted,"my niece saw this toy and she needed it so bad, i had to buy it for her right away!this company is the best."
2,Does NOT come with access codes,I am disappointed with the Kindle version of this book because it does not come with access codes to retrieve the data needed to complete the exercises. I bought this for an online GIS course I am taking and I thought the Kindle version would come in handy because I work full time and I have a two hour commute to/from work to home. It's a lot easier to keep the electronic version on my tablet instead of lugging an extra book around. I now have to have the instructor send me the data files electronically for each assignment instead of being able to load them on my computer all at once. This is a major pain that could've been avoided if it was explicitly noted somewhere that no data came with the e-version.
3,Keeps My Home a Little Less Stinky,"Pros:*Works well when the cigarette is resting in the ashtray*2 C Batteries last about a month with normal use (1-2 smokers)*Relatively quiet if placed on a soft surface*Filters and batteries are very easy to change*Long motor-life (I've had mine for over a year and it's still running strong, even when it gets clogged with ashes and tar)Cons:*Difficult to clean the fan and lower compartments that house the batteries and filters*Doesn't ""suck"" smoke into the ashtray from more than a few inches away.*Fiters seem to need changing more often than batteries, which can become pricey.*Noisy if placed on a hard surface (can be remedied by putting a snall towel under it to quiet the vibrations)"
2,Only read if you're looking for erotica,"It didn't take me long to get bored with ""Boy Banned"". I don't mind good steamy scenes, but the sex scenes read like porn. I felt like the story was just there to string the sex scenes together. If you want a good story about a boy band, read ""Do You Know That I Love You"" by Mark Roeder. It's much sexier, even though it doesn't have much sex in it. If you are looking for for erotica, read ""Boy Banned""."
4,Reliable,"I battled a bit with this product at first then realized it was my network causing the problem not the NAS200. I have a RAID 1 with 2 500GB drives & 2 USB drives on it and I am vary happy with the speeds I see. I use the web access to get to my files off the internet which is really nice. Only suggestion, put it on a UPS. It does not like power failures...Update: This unit needs a fan to keep it cool. It tends to heat up and fail. A reboot will get it up and going again but sometimes it takes many reboots. There are better products out there now and I did add another netdrive to my network but it was a Trendnet not a Linksys..."
1,Why is it so slow...,"Here is the answer. Top speed is theoretical 10 mbs, yeah I know the manufacture says it is a 10/100 ethernet port, but the fact is with all of these manufactures the chip inside is only 10, and that a theorectical 10, so plan on half that speed. Just for comparison 10 mbs is slower that USB1.0 ! The reason why is that if these home user NAS devices were anywhere fast, there cheap price tag would under cut the professional storage arrays for the small buisness owner. WD releassed a MyBook world ed., a NAS with RAID and bragged about it having a gigbyte ethernet jack! But the truth was revield that depite having a gigabyte ethernet connectivity, top speed was limited to 10 mbs (keep in mind that number just as 100 or 1000 is theoretical, it is more meanfull to use those numbers in relation to the amount of traffic on the network). Just FYI."
1,If it would only WORK!!!,"I get the nas and set it up...oops...bad sata port (so raid, etc would not work), RMA...linksys takes 3.5 WEEKS to get an rma unit. Then I get the RMA'd unit and the firmware on it is messed up and linksys wants to RMA again...of course...backordered RMA, 4 week delay...RETURNED...i am buying a thecus or sans digital now (at 2x the price)!!!"
2,Way Too Formal,"If you're into very traditional, formal poetry, than this is the volume for you. However, if you're looking for something more original and inspired, you may be disappointed. I was looking for fodder for my wedding ceremony and found scant evidence of any deeply evocative poetry in this volume."
3,"Nice book but not really what I have expected,",didn't like most of the projects but still there are some helpful tips.
2,Anna in the Doldrums,"It was with some great surprise that I saw this book had generated such a crowd of fans since it had alternated between being laughably dim and grossly wrong. Yes, the plot is a cute (albeit generic) romance between a likable girl and an attractive guy, the problem being all sorts of family issues. Unfortunatly, the book was poorly written; the writing was flat, doing no justice to the protagonists who were so avid about poetry. The book's historical quality was struck down by the police's respect of our heroine: in Regency times, women did not have that sort of power. By the end of the book, I found myself reaching for Austen and Heyer, the cover being the best part of the Avon book."
4,I enjoyed it!,Yeah he does mimick Kirk Franklin on this cd but Kirk also does some switching up in his music styles. This album is straight contemporary gospel. The beats are tight and every song on the album would be great to use for christian airplay not just gospel. Gary Mayes is kind of like a blend of Kirk Franklin and Brent Jones who both by the way crossed over and get airplay on major christian stations. You may have to listen to it a couple of times though to actually figure out what he's saying in some of the songs. But the beats will grab your attention right away.
2,Not for amateurs,"The projects in this book are not for amateurs, so I was disappointed. The idea of modern projects instead of the glut of cutesy cottage and traditional projects that fill most books and magazines today is great. But these projects require that you have a lot of tools and know something about using them. By the time I get all the tools and ruin a lot of materials in learning what to do with them, I may as well just buy ready-made furniture. I was hoping for more simple projects."
4,ok for ideas,"This book was inspirational, and I love Todd Oldham but some of the projects are a little complicated for someone w/o any carpentry skills or lack of work space. I would recommend ""Readymade"" instead."
4,"great effect, wish it has better smell","I have combinational skin that is very oily in the T-zone and dry cheeks. This mask leaves a clean and refreshed feeling as well as slightly brighter skin (cuz it removed all the dirt/oil).Beware, apply a layer that is thick enough that your skin doesn't show through immediately, not no more than that, or else it burns a little. It also smells too much of mud/clay/spackle under the faint minty smell. However, it is definitely an effective mask and a great deal at this price."
5,"Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque comes in a jar, my life is complete!",This masque is a great old standby drugstore product that really does work. The only problem is that it ususlly is sold in a plastic tube that makes it difficult to get all the product out when the tube becomes low. Problem solved with this handy bin!
2,Cheaply made and unstable,These chairs are horrible. Very cheaply made and feel like they are going to break when you sit in them.
4,"Easy, breezy read","I enjoyed this book, particularly since I like books about family and ancestral ties, and the bonds between generations. This is a rapid read, and enjoyable."
2,Cantastic...not!,"Chef Boyardee must have cheated his way through culinary school, 'cuz this stuff rots! There were very few meatballs...the sauce was way to acidic...and the pasta was quite mushy. Check out Campbell's spaghettios with meatballs if you need a fix."
4,"yummi,yummi great flavor","All my family love these ones because they are super good,great tasting,great price and is Chef-boy-ar-dee,really yummi."
1,Don't waste your money,The only controller that lasts is the original Nintendo units. You get what you pay for with controllers.
4,Call me crazy...,I actually liked the film. Idk if it's because I'm an Omarion and Malika fan but it was better than expected.
4,excellent and easy recipes,"This was Dave's initial cookbook. I have enjoyed watching him on FoodNetwork and also his second cookbook, so I wanted to have his first book in my collection. I have already prepared several meals from this book and all were tasty and successes."
1,What tracks are on this CD?,Why don't you show the tracks that are on this CD?????? How would anyone know if they want it without that information?????????????
2,Horrid Audio,"I cannot over emphasize how frustrating it is to attempt to hear the fine commentary while it is being almost totally obliterated by noise from helicoptors, bells, whistles, horns and other crowd noise. How could this product be released with such inept audio mixing? Didn't anyone listen to it before it was released? I often must turn off the audio as all I can hear is noise. Anyone who owns this DVD should be given a new one that is mixed correctly."
2,Dramatic video ruined by awful sound quality,"I have pretty much every tour since the late 80's on dvd or vhs. After last year's dramatic race, I decided to spring for the 12 hour coverage, and I'm still kicking myself for not getting the cheaper disc.As others have said, the sound is awful. The commentary is buried deep in the corner of one speaker and often overwhelmed by background noise. WCP normally does a decent job with their videos, but this is so bad that it's difficult to watch it."
4,Magnificent 7 - but what about the first 6?,"I bought this collection for my husband, an avid Lance Armstrong/Tour de France fan. He has really enjoyed it, so I feel it was a great success. But I have to admit that I thought it would include footage and commentary from all seven of Lance's Tour de France victories, plus details about his life and his fight with cancer. It only detailed his seventh victory, the 2005 Tour. Nevertheless, I am glad I purchsed it; although for the money, it would have been nice for it to include a bit more. Thank you!"
3,scratchy,"As much as I love Jezebel sexy and true to size bras, this one is definitely scratchy. It is a very pretty bra...wear only when you know you won't be having it on long. lol"
2,Really cute but flimsy,I love the way this bra looks but it does not offer much support. It feels flimsy. I sent it back.
5,Excellent all-around guide to adventures.,Sourcebook takes the sometimes exhausting leg-work out of planning various types of adventure travel. Great resource to get started on a trip. To bad it is not updated every year or two.
1,Boring,The movie was not the one I thought it was but anyway I received it on time and in excellent condition from the seller
4,Dweezil does Frank proud.,Been wanting this dvd for along time. Glad I finally got it. It did not disappoint. Awesome setlist and amazing performances. Worth every penny.
3,Review,Thought it would be more helpful forMy intro.to.hebrews classholes are not big enough to fit in three ring binder
5,christmas gift,I GAVE THIS AS PART OF A CHRISTMAS PRESENT TO MY DAD. HE WAS SHOCKED AND ELATED BY THE STUDY GUIDE
3,"sparse,minimal,uninspiring","being a huge david sylvian fan, i find his latest solo release his weakest yet with very little instrumentation and boring lyrics. am looking forward to next project with steve jensen and possible japan- rain tree crow collaboration."
3,A pretty good introduction,"A nice book for armchair browsing and background reading. Unexceptional information in the charts, but they *are* accompanied by full-color blazons."
3,Gets the Job Done,"This product was definitely a bit more difficult to install than I had anticipated mainly due to the rough time I had trying to disconnect the temperature control cable on the factory dash. I ended up just taking the dash out as much as I could and disconnecting it that way instead of trying to reach under the dash.After installed, my Sony GT410U fits in there quite nicely but it does feel, as someone else pointed out, that the entire dash could be easily removed if someone really wanted to. Make no mistake though, it won't fall out on you while you're driving but is liable to be easily ripped out if someone had the intention of doing so.All in all, it gets the job done. The texture and LED lights that light up the air vent controls are a bit different from stock but that doesn't really bother me. This product could be a bit better but it's pretty much the only option you've got if you want to install an after market radio into your Escort."
3,Poor quality but no alternatives,"quite a poor quality, cheap plastic, but I guess this is the only product of its kind for ford escort- so there is no much choise.Manual is not very helpful. Hovewer it is very easy to mount/dismout controls to/from the adapter."
4,I don't think the reviewr below and I read the same book,"Poseidon's Gold pits Falco against the forces that would defame the good name of his not-so-honorable brother Festus, his father and a band of art thieves trying to collect a questionably unpaid debt. This lacked some of the action that marks the earlier Falco novels which is why it only merited four stars, but it's still great fun. It's not entirely fare to compare Davis with Saylor - his writing is very different and while it is sophisticated it lacks the irony and humor of Davis' work. Read her when you want to smile and let's hope poor Falco gets a break in one of her future books."
4,Nice images,"Great images. The cards depict photographs of animals in natural settings. I give them 4 stars for that reason alone. The cards themselves are somewhat flimsy. You have to supervise your kids with these or they won't last long. My 16-month-old twins prefer the DK Publishing Touch and Feel Cards to these cards, mostly because the DK Publishing cards come in a flip-top, velcro box. One of my girls can sit for 10 or 15 minutes, an eternity in toddler time, just taking the DK Publishing cards out of the box and putting them back in. So you may want to consider those as well. But these are pretty good."
3,Can't quite get it clean,"I purchased this amp to give my electric guitar the portability of an acoustic guitar, and in that regard, the Pignose does well. However, I don't play with distortion, so I obviously want a clean sound out of my electric guitars. It seems that no matter what I do, there's always a bit of fuzz in the tone of the Pignose, and while the tone is acceptable, I really want a completely clean tone. I've heard that a clean tone can be achieved if you keep the volume low, but no matter how low the volume of my guitar or the Pignose, I can't find a completely clean tone. Perhaps ""clean"" is a relative term. When I want clean, I want squeaky sparkling clean, with no distortion whatsoever. The Pignose would easily get 5 stars from me if could get a clean tone at a usable volume, but because a clean tone is so elusive, I can only give it 3 stars."
5,41 Willys coupe,"I bought this body for a Tmaxx 3.3 for which it is slightly undersized.I did make it work and will post photos later when I'm done with it.It would be perfect for the smaller 1/10th scale trucks or cars like RC10s.I have painted the Willys and posted a photo of it mounted on a Traxxas T-Maxx 3.3.I did not mask the windshield because this is a nitro truck and needs air to the motor.I'll cut the windshield out before I run it.I had to modify the front mount to a single post in the center because the shape of the frontdidn't line up very good with the factory 2 front body mounts.""Candy Apple Red with Silver backer"""
4,4.5 stars really,"It does exactly what it's supposed to, in a fairly small package, and I haven't noticed any signal degradation since I've been using it. I've managed to get my DVD and cable remotes to sync up with it, though it doesn't work with my Nintendo Wii (which uses Bluetooth).My only complaint is that the device will occasionally jump from Input 3 to Input 1 for no reason. I'm not sure if this is a problem with the device, or if it's due to outside RF interference (say, my neighbor turning on her TV). Not much of a problem, since this has only happened twice since I've owned the device.If you have limited component inputs on your HDTV, this is an excellent deal."
3,Journey in to boredom,"I love me some John Douglas. I admire his work and will always consider ""Mindhuter"" my favorite book of all time. But I was so incredibly bored with ""Journey in to Darkness"". Definitely pick it up if you're a JDouglas fan and if you enjoy criminal behavioral type books. But if this is your initial ""journey"" in to this genre, I'd start elsewhere."
4,Sequel to Mindhunter,"John Douglas continues showing the inside of the criminal mind in Journey. High Profile cases like O.J. Simpson are included. Other cases are also included that are not as well known such as Suzanne Collins, a Marine killed by a civilian on post. As with the first installment, not for the faint of heart or anyone offended by graphic descriptions or language. Well written and easily to understand, a real page turner."
3,Journey Into Darkness,"A very good book. Seeing what human beings can do to eachother, especially what they do to children children, can make you want to vomit. Douglas is a very good profiler. The only problem with this book is that the author spent too much time focusing on how the families of the victims and how they are helping to reach out to the families of victims of violent crimes. He took three chapters to talk about the family and hystory of a murder victim names Lance Corp. Collins. It dragged on a bit, and he payed special attention to this victim, and almost no attention to the personal lives of the other victims.Also, I would have liked to see more about how profiles are made, not just the profiles in each case.All in all it was a good book and I wouldn't mind reading his other books."
3,Enjoyable but flawed,"Don't get me wrong. I liked this book - just barely. Douglas and Olshaker are adept at providing harrowing descriptions of the most heinous crimes without glorifying them. This speaks volumes about Douglas's experience and his sensitivity. Unfortunately, he shows his own glaring prejudices as well. He uses a great portion of this book to step up on the soapbox and espouse the merits of victims rights and habeus corpus (death penalty) reform. Views I happen to fall in line with and was happy to find on a best seller list. I just wish I'd been given fair warning that was the direction the book would take. This book isn't really about looking into the mind of the beasts that terrorize the innocent. It's really a vehicle Douglas uses to lecture on his pet issues. The vivid crime writing is a means to an advertising campaign in my humble opinion"
4,Is love is right around the corner for you?,"It is for the Tessa and Brian, the heroine and hero in this latest release by Donna Wright. You won't believe what brings them together! For those who enjoy a fun and romantic read, Donna's genuine, down-to-earth characters remind us that romance and true love are alive and well in Hometown USA."
1,Just glad I sold it on ebay before the price plummets,"Everything written here about this game is amusingly true. I cannot figure out what EA was thinking by creating this game. For those familiar with Madden 2006 the interface is alot like Superstar mode only more restrictive. The ""Superstar"" and ""Head Coach"" concepts are intriguing, but EA should stick with what has worked for years. Their franchise mode is WAY more user friendly than it is in NFL Head Coach. I love Madden's Franchise mode and if EA had set up NFL Head Coach under that format I think the game would be much more successful. Better yet, just include ""Coaching Mode"" as part of the Madden 2008 game. Now that would be cool!"
1,I do have a life,At first the game started out well. I was surprised about all of the things I was able to do. But after a few hours I realized that in order for me to fully enjoy this game I would have to play for a few hour every day. There ae just too many tasks when all I really want to do is develop my own coaching strategy. Not what I expected.
2,Sorta works....,I installed this in a 2002 Crown Vic. The fit is poor and had to use a hacksaw and file. Must be something better...
5,wow,"Great book! Unlike a ton of feng shui books, this one you can actually read and understand. Very good, for teens and adults. Very thorough explanations."
1,"Akai LCD 26"" Bad buy","Purchased this tv, after six months it would power off when it got warm, so we exchanged for a newer model and now the new one after a year will not turn on. For a while if we pushed the power button over a 100 times it would finally come on a couple of nights ago it took an hour and a half before it would come on and tonight it does not come on at all."
2,THE GALAXY PRIMES,"I thought this book would interest me. However, when I began reading it I found it to be rather boring."
4,Limited but Useful,"Well-written, personable, somewhat condensed account of George Washington's first 43 years of life. Covers the period from Washington's birth to his appointment as the commander-in-chief of the (yet unformed) Continental Army. Flexner's criticism of Washington's youthful deficiencies in the French and Indian War are particularly cogent, while the author's obvious admiration of his subject dissipates any fear of authorial axe-grinding."
3,G. Hale,"Not quite as good as the original Mandingo series--ya know-- the ones that were made before ""politically correct"" became a calling card in America. The author must have been under pressure to take the edge off the violence. Too bad. Violence is reality."
3,Mediocre Album,"I think the CD is okay, nothing more nothing less. The whole theme of ""hip hop is dead"" is stupid to me. A few of the tracks have some really poorly produced beats fused with these annoying rock rifts. Criticisms aside, there are a few tracks on there that I'm really feeling. Of course none of the albums NaS puts out are going to touch Illmatic, but I don't expect that...I just think his newer albums aren't anything special and that his hip hop has gone downhill over the years."
3,Disappointing,"Don't get me wrong, the album is not bad, but we have formulated such high standards of Nas. All of his albums are expected to be pure classics. He is definitely not the reason why hip hop is dead, however, I expected more out of him."
5,Nas is hip hop!!!,I loved everything about this album. I've always been a Nas fan but he made me understand what I love about him and hip hop. I'm old skool so I always listen for lyrical content. Rap's newcomers are really wack when you compare them to Nas!!!
4,A Fascinating Subject,"Also the book is fascinating and I don't know of any other book of it's kind. Not forgetting Michael Howard's ""The Book of Fallen Angels"". My only problem is that the writers introduce a new thought or theory and say ""it is possible"" or ""maybe"" or ""probably""then they go on as if it is factual. Also the bibliography is comprised mostly of highly credulous books that lends it a highly speculative color. That said the book is most entertaing and speculation done right is damn fun !"
2,spend the the extra money,"I opted to purchase these combo packs due to the extraordinary price, but you get what you pay for. They are knock-offs of the real thing. Menu options are hard to use sometimes and chapter skimming is difficult. If I could do it all over again, I'd buy the actual seasons."
5,great game,good:-great game if you like strategy games-great support for the game from amazon-easy to download and install-can always re-download if you mess up or lose the game filebad:-long download time
4,Good but time-consuming,"I very much enjoyed this game, but be warned it will sap time. It led me to quit playing computer games!The one criticism I have of it is that the automatic battle resolution doesn't take account of your previous proven skill as a general. As such I ended up controlling every little battle so as to maintain my edge. If the auto-resolution took account of your past performance in manually-controlling battles, rather than just comparing troop strength, it would be much more enjoyable to allow the computer to resolve unimportant (or expectedly boring) battles."
5,Perfect game!,This game was one of the best created. It is a shame that they haven'tt released a more up-to-date version.
4,OKay,This is a pretty fun game but I caution those of you who are looking for a twenty min game that this one isnt for you. One campaign tends to last at least three hours if not more. Its alot like the boardgame risk so fun but only if you can sit down and spend most of your day on it.
4,Happy Baby,My baby girl doesn't get so upset at night now that her wipes are warm. The container is great the only down side is it isn't as tall as the wipes are designed for so with the refill packs I have to split the groups into thirds instead of half like the huggies wipes come.
2,Design Flaw,"The top won't stay shut. I hoped we had a defective one, returned it and purchased another. After the first week, it would stay shut again. I found a solution for the wipes that dry out (the more wipes in there, the moister they are). I found that if you add more wipes to the bottom before it's empty, you don't have to throw away the last 5-10 wipes. So many flaws that I worked around, but I refuse to use a paper weight to keep the lid shut. Great concept, bad design. I wonder if the Prince Lionhart brand warmer is better."
1,bummer!,"It's kind of a useless purchase. The wipes tend to fall down often, so you have to open the whole top to get at them instead of them ""popping-up."" The button on the pop-up lid broke so we had to keep it shut with a jar of diaper cream. And in the end, our baby didn't really mind a mildly cold wipe after all."
3,Lights went out,We started using the product liked it very much seeing the fact the baby was happy getting wiped with warm wipes in mid of night or cold days. But 2 nd week itself the glow lights went off :( . So now we are always in doubt if its working and if we will find the wipes next time we open it .
2,wipe fast! .....before it cools off.,"I think this is a good concept but has it's limitations. the wipes are only warm for a moment so wipe fast my friend, very fast."
3,just ok,"The first supernanny is great, this one is ok but not as good. The reason is she simply answers very specific questions from letters she has from parents. Many of these questions and answers were things that very few people have to deal with and thus not as good. The one chapter I did like was the extra explanation she gives about how to correctly do a time out."
4,Great parenting source for your library!,"I love Supernanny's no nonsense style of parenting and discipline. I gave this book a four because it's not the answer all questions book, but a great place to look for those general and even not so general questions you may have when it comes to dealing with your children."
1,Ignorance is bliss,"This woman blamed video games for the London riots. How misguided can a person be, they were clearly caused by sports. Don't buy her books."
3,What Every Parent Wants to Know,"I purchased the book to give to someone that I thought would learn a lot from it, but after much thought I did not give it away as I did not want to stur up hard feelings."
2,Assembling (Northern) California,"Having recently moved to Southern California, I have been consumed with a desire to learn about the geology of my environment. I was highly disappointed to find that this book barely touches on the southern part of the state.If the author had spent as much time discussing the Transverse Ranges, Mojave Desert, L.A. Basin, Salton Trough, etc., as he did in rambling on about the Gold Rush and the childhood of his favored geologist, I would have enjoyed the book much more. The book is fine if you are interested in Northern California, but the title is misleading and should be ""Assembling Northern California""."
1,worthless book!,"I was forced to purchase this book for my mechanical engineering class, powerplant design. It is one of the most useless books I have ever had to read. The book is out of date, does a terrible job with thermodynamics, and a minimal job explaining turbine geometry or dynamics. I used my thermodynamics, kinematics, and dynamics books from other classes more than I used this book. Then when I wanted to re-sell the book I purchased for $225, I got $25."
1,Junk,"Dont buy this, worked for about 2 days. The tuners will not keep the strings tight,much less in tune. We bought this as a guitar for my daughter, should have just paid 20 dollars for a box of trash."
5,Excellent Dancing,I loved this DVD the dancers are excellent. The scenery is nice too. Highly recommend it.
1,Left wing garbage,If you like Captain America... don't buy this book. If you enjoy reading something that isn't saturated with political slanting... don't read this book. If you enjoy good art... don't read this book. If you enjoy good writing... don't read this book.The only reason that I could imagine you would enjoy this book is if you are a bumbling liberal who enjoys watching a beloved comic book hero get pissed on!This book is utter garbage. I don't want to be told how I should believe from my comic books. Marvel make sure your writers aren't borderline retarded before putting them on a book that addresses real world events.
3,Tempi too fast!,"Jaervi can be wonderful with this kind of repertory -- I heard an overwhelming live performance of the Prokofiev Third Symphony with the NY Philharmonic some years ago, with tremendous kinetic power and orchestral brilliance -- but he takes these pieces far too fast for them to breathe. Even Boulez, not known for his Romantic slowness, is less brisk than Jaervi (Boulez' first two movements of Symphony No. 3 are each a minute slower than these performances). Consequently the climaxes, esp. in the 4th Symphony, feel terribly rushed and robbed of power. Munch or Cluytens are preferable. Technically good, but interpretatively not the best. Roussel needs more leisure for his earthy, Flemish strength to be felt, and for the harmonic, contrapuntal and coloristic richness to be properly heard. (There is also a deep elegiac sadness to the 4th Symphony which doesn't come out at these speeds.)"
3,Exercise book,"Here is how, in 10 minutes a day, to achieve a youthful body and increased vitality-without tiring exercises.Ingrid Bergman, Frederic March, Gloria Swanson and many other notables have benefited from and enthusiastically endorse the Mensendieck system of movement schemes. Now, for the first time, this world renowned system is available in sample, popular form. The 43 easy to do movements are scientifically designed to revitalize specific muscles and joints. They help you end backaches.. flatten the abdomen.. Take inches off hips and waste.. And sculpture the chest and correct other body faults.."
3,Beautiful Knives----Iffy Selection,"Other reviews of these knives weren't lying. They're top notch---quality handles and blades. The utility scissors and honing steel are welcome additions as well. But, I think I would have preferred a wider variety of food preparation knives rather than all the steak knives. For example, there was no filleting knife at all."
1,Idiotic Judgment,"Filled with hate and prejudice. Optimism goes a long way. Ask not what your country can do for you, but rather what you can do for your county."
4,Gaits of horses,Good book to have to show you the different gaited horses and what constitutes a gait.
3,pretty good hub,"My overall impression is that you are getting what you pay for. This hub/reader comes with a power adapter that theoreticaly allows you to charge/power USB devices without attaching them to a computer. The power adapter did not work on the hub I purchased, but the hub and card reader work well. So if you are looking for an inexpensive USB 2.0, 3 port hub/card reader this one works fine."
3,Quality of book,"I am sorry, the springer book binding is crappy. I have already lost the hard cover just by one drop from the desk, while similar drops from other publishers/makers have remained sturdier.---.On the algorithms, referring earlier editions, there is a change in PCP reducing a one to critical section duration, for computing max blocking time[pg 232]. This is confusing without explaining the reasons for it.great reference book though."
4,"Good, but not great","I purchased this DVD & Doug Swensens Ashtanga yoga short forms together & I think Doug Swenson's is MUCH better. I was generally pleased with the format, however the way they crop for the shorter sessions is a little 'jumpy' at points. I also thought she does not thoroughly explain poses or breathing as well as Doug Swenson. I have been casually practicing ashtanga for 3 years or so, so I am familiar with the routines, & this stays true to the ashtanga routine. Overall, I'm glad I have the DVD for variety, but it is not my favorite."
3,For the advanced practitioner,"I am a beginner in yoga, having had only hatha classes, and less than 20 of those. I am a healthy 37 year old female with average flexibility. This video has a lot of inversions, and other advanced poses, that I simply cannot do yet. Having to modify apx. 50% of the workout means that I don't get much of a workout from this video, just frustration. On the other hand, I can see that this would be an excellent video for someone who is more experienced. I have no idea why this is called ""ease into ashtanga""....I don't feel that it helped me ease into it."
3,Great Showcase of Talent,"This film is a great showcase of William Powell's and Myrna Loy's talent. They both shine, which makes up for any holes in the plot. The film successfully builds suspense, but it also stays short enough not to bore its viewers."
5,Excellent on beef,I tried this out for the 1st time and it'll vary depending on your smoker. But I tested it on an smoker box and placed it on my grill. it worked and made the flavors and smell of the meats i was cooking excellent. Highly recommended to others. Just make sure you read on how to properly set it up or you'll burn all your chips.
2,Save your money,"I couldn't wait to get this book. It sounded like a great story of adventure across several continents. After the first chapter I deeply regreted my purchase. What had great potential turned out to be two guys boasting about their popularity and how it was going to be difficult being celebrities. Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't know them at all, despite their numerous references to the movies they've been in. I thought I was getting a book about the challenges of travel abroad and pictures of these places. What I got was a book with too many pictures of the authors, weak stories of the places they stayed in and the food they ate."
4,Great adventure story,"I really enjoyed this! I liked how they shared the good and the bad of their trip. I was a bit worried that it was going to be about how ""everything was wonderful"" and I wondered if it was going to seem fake. However, that was not the case. It's amazing what they did and how they shared their concerns and thoughts about stopping/turning around/going home. The book also had good descriptions of places that many of us will never visit - Ukraine, Mongolia, Siberia..."
5,A Bittersweet Love Story of Sorts,"This really is a bitter-sweet love story. The story begins with war scenes and the near Death of a soldier. During the life saving surgery,there are several rather unusual events that forshadow future events. The whole story seems to revolve around the 50/60's paranoia of the unknown or communist invasion/subversion,then the story then becomes a mystery as more people are searched out for sinister and or unexplained abilitiesduring theinvestigatigation it is noticed that severly ill or hurt or damaged children are dissapearing. The ending is a beautiful and actually unexpected."
5,LOVE it!,"awesome story lines with great writing, great scenery. Love how Sicily is shown and the dialect used by the actors (sub titles in English). Love the entire series!!!"
2,Lost in the Details,"Oh dear. This guy has read about 27 too many Russian novels.The author sifted through a sea of jumbled information about one of the craftiest characters in the long history of espionage, and produced, well, another sea of jumbled information. After three paragraphs in any chapter, it's not clear what or whom he's talking about -- or even why.Less detail and more careful analysis and supposition would have been MOST helpful, thank you.I'm about to stop reading, give up, and stick with the TV series."
3,"Highly useful, but cheaply made","The first one lasted a few months before coming apart. I bought a replacement that has been fine ever since.If you have an older style Hasselblad film back without a dark slide holder, then this is a highly useful accessory, just don't expect it to be of the same quality as the rest of your Hassy gear. For my money, I'd rather spend a bit extra and get one of the newer film backs with a built-in dark slide holder."
5,Excelente producto,"Este producto es lo que esperaba. Ha mejorado grandemente el funcionanmiento de mi pc. Antes con algunas aplicaciones y mi antiguo procesador mi pc se ponia lenta o se pegaba, ahora va volando!!"
5,these r great books!!,i ahve only read angels watching over me and until angels close my eyes and yet to read the other one but so far they are greta books! i usually read horsze books but one day my teacher didn't have any horse books so i picked up angels watching over me and i loved it so much come to find out my cuz had until angels close my eyes and i alos love it!!
3,To spiritual,"This book was alright, one thing i didn't expect this much spiritual stuff i it. I knew it would have some stuff by the title but not this much. I've read a lot of her others and this one she could have done a little better it needed more REALITY in it. I probably will stil read the 2 others that come after though."
5,Tell me a story...,"This book is extremely useful if you are at the point of analyzing your life's story. I am involved in an extremely intimate group of fellow believers and we had already taken the time to tell our individual stories to each other. It was exhausting and scary and made us extremely vulnerable to each other. And now, we are working through this book and discovering how our stories have affected us and how we can grow beyond them. So far, so good. I'm excited to see what God will do now that we have exposed the truth about ourselves. We already know that we will have to retell our stories after we have finished this book, but it doesn't seem so scary anymore. It is freeing to pinpoint the things that hold us back and the things that make us soar. It's also extremely important to see God's penmanship all over our lives. And it's wonderful to share the journey with dear, safe friends."
2,Does not fit all the vehicles implied.,"I could not get this to properly fit in a 2002 Dodge Ram Van. The instructions made no sense, telling you to cut off the very tabs you would need to mount it. With a Pioneer deck mounted, it would not fit the dash opening unless you cut off the pocket. Very poor documentation."
4,fit just fine,"worked just right in my 98 Ram. Four stars because the finish isn't quite the same as my truck (it's more shiny), but it fit just fine."
2,not for the average self learner,"This book is fine for students who have no problem manipulating equations anddon't mind doing calculation after calculation after calculation after calculation...Way to many calculations for the student who just wants a basic idea of what chemistry isall about. Probably a good book for students who naturally are good at calculating, selflearning, figuring out problems with little guidance. The assessments always presentproblems in a way that is different than how they were presented in the examples.Very frustrating for this homeschool mom whose high school aged daughter is not interested in the subject. (She started off a little interested, now is just completely turned off to it.) Even her math tutor doesn't want totackle some of the problems."
2,Praying with Hildegard of Bingen,"Gloria Durka has written other books within the ""Praying With"" series which are very good (notably the one on Julian of Norwich), but this effort on Hildegard of Bingen was disappointing. While the introduction is a very good summary of Hildegard's life and times and some of the major themes of her writings, the actual chapters are quite shallow. There is simply not enough ""meat"" for prayer and reflection. More excerpts from her writings would have been welcome. However, for some, it may be a non-threatening introduction to this major figure."
4,A worthwhile purchase,"Bought this as a ""refurbished"" item - but looked brand new to me. Great functionality.It can fit in two DSLRs (D90+D300S) and my most frequently used lenses (Nikkor 17-55mm f2.8, 70-200mm f2.8 VR II, 35mm f1.8), plus a SB600, and a 13"" McBook without any problem (it might fit a 15"" notebook, but I didn't try that). It also has a front pouch that can accommodate a tripod, and it even has a cover to shield the bag against water. It has the perfect size to fit in an aircraft cabin.The bag is very well build, and is a bit heavy even without any gear.It is overall a very good bag."
5,Perfect for planes!,"I was heading out on a trip for a photography job- my first. I don't have an overly impressive camera setup yet, but taking that plus the laptop to be able to download and review, I really needed something that I could fit both, take as carry on, and still be able to fit a few other things. This baby has more than enough room for my camera- and could fit 2 full SLRs, plus extra lenses and other accessories. Plus I can fit my laptop, and some files/books/paperwork. There are a few smaller pockets, and the whole thing has great clips to secure things closed. It can get a little heavy carrying all that on your back, but this has great, comfortable straps, and I love that I can close it across my chest to keep the straps in place. The best part was that I can actually fit this under the seat in front on the plane, so I don't have to worry about anything getting crushed in the stow compartments!"
4,Derma e Hyaluronic Serum ....,"I purchased this serum in the last month and am quite pleased with it. I have been using Derma e's Very Clear problem skin moisturizer and the Tropical solutions serum for about a year now and love them but wanted to add a different serum for the variety. I have used this serum at night. It is fairly fluid & thin, but my skin feels moisturized when I wake up. It is not as thick as some of their other serums (ex: Tropical solutions serum) but this is a plus as I find heavier creams tend to clog my pores more.Details:Light serumconsistency is thin/fluidScent freeskin feels moisturizedNot as thick as some people may want"
1,TERRIBLE,I THOUGHT THIS GAME MIGHT BE COOL BUT WHEN I PLAYED IT WAS HORRIBLE HERES STUFF ABOUT ITGRAPHICS:1/1O IT WAS TO FUZZYSOUND:1/10 TERRIBLEGAMEPLAY:1/10 VERY HARDCOOLNESS:1/10 NOTHINGS COOL ABOUT ITRESULT:TERRIBLEMAYBE RENT IT BUT DO NOT BUY THIS DUMB GAME.
4,Buffy is the best,"The Xbox magizine gave this a 9 it should get a ten! I love Buffy it is awesome! Well back to the game, it has the best graphics and the best storyline TOO! Plus there is an awesome code so that at least three can play YYWBBYYYYYWB b=black w= white. Just press start when you sommon a demon and the one that goes all sparkaley is the one you or your friend are! I'm on the second to last level. GAME ON!"
4,I don't get the high marks.,"I know the show deserves its wild popularity. I'm a big fan. But, this game is dreadful. The graphics and fighting are based on old technology. I figure that the engine isn't even as sophisticated as the original Tomb Raider (how many years ago was that?) And, the game has absolutely no challenge. There is only one path to follow, so the whole thing amounts to walking down a straight line, pounding on some baddies and listening to the two or three quips ""Buffy"" has in her arsenal. The cut scenes where we see the other characters are incredibly droll because, again, the conversation is entirely linear. You go to any character, press the button, watch a dialogue. Repeat. There's no variance depending on the order you speak to the characters nor any options on what you say to them.In short... BORING."
2,Production Values SHOULD be a whole lot better,"Kultur has a whole lot of fine titles in their collections. Content wise - they give a good though superficial survey of their subjects, but their production values are in the sewer. I keep ordering and I keep getting stung. The NYC Tabloids have a better printing production record than that which is issued in Kultur's ART SERIES. Come on DVD is supposed to be sharp and crisp. The Post-impressionists follows the poor reproduction in The Impressionists which follows the poor reproduction in The Dutch Masters, which follows The Landmarks of Western Art. Do you get the picture? I wish Kultur would GET THE PICTURE and then give us a quality DVD reproduction of the world great art."
2,very superficial,Generally a weak book with little value added. It is a compilation of articles more than a book really. I regret buying it.
3,Same as the first.,"This game is almost exactly the same as the first. The gameplay is pretty cool, the graphics are great, and the create player mode is awesome. All together its a pretty cool game."
3,Ultra Measur Master,"Its a great calculator for beginners, school or college use..My needs are slightly bigger than what this one does for me..I hope Calculated Ind. can do some major improvements in their future design.."
5,Wonderful,"If you are a beginner in the world of filmmaking buy this book. If you are a veteran in the world of filmmaking, buy this book. It is packed full of information for the beginner and seasoned vertran of the movie industry.Definately one to use as a bible of filmmaking."
5,Very soft on baby's skin!,"I use washcloths and not baby wipes to clean my baby, for every single diaper change. These washcloths are soft and easy to clean even when they are stained with some poop once in a while."
2,not as soft as you'd expect for a baby,I hope after a good wash is Dreft these washcloths will soften but they leave a little to be desired when looking for a product for you kid
3,"O.K., but not the best","These washcloths are o.k., but not the greatest on the market. I will warn you, however, that I expect towels to be plush and soft...particularly when it comes to a baby's skin!"
1,Bad internal design causes breakage.,"Nice controller in general, but I have returned 4 of these things because after about a year the down control on the D-pad stops working because of a poor design - the D-pad hits against the circuit board underneath and wears through the connection. If you play a lot of games I would look for something else."
2,Mehhhhhh...,"I just picked this one up at Wal-Mart today and am returning it for a refund tomorrow! I bought it because it's basically a Playstation controller for your PC and I like the idea of having so many buttons. Everything about it is just fine except for 2 key things. One, the size is just too friggin small for grown up hands. They're designed for 12 year old hands! Two, the directional pad is horrible! To have a great gamepad, the directional pad has to be ultra-responsive. When are companies going to realize this? I tried this pad out with some console type games on my PC and I couldn't fluidly move my thumb around on the directional pad to move the character on the screen. In order to accurately control my guy, I had to push my thumb on the directional pad as if I were typing on a keyboard! I'll probably have a thumb-ache tomorrow."
1,SUSPECT,"I wonder Where is James Brown,Miles Davis,Rick James,Prince? &Countless Other Performances.SNL has Had some Great Performances but you wouldn't know it by their choices on this disc.very sad."
2,I'm disappointed,Ok if you are young and hip then you will like this album. There are some good tracks on it. The title is a misnomer as this album (and likewise vol.2) ignores most of the early years of the show. You can check the dates of the musical performances for yourself. After watching the SNL25 show I know that there are some legendary performers and performances that could have been included. I can only hope that the producers will come out with a Vol.3 and 4 that will rectify this omission.
2,What a shame...,"...Cool gadgets, good weapons, but it was all ruined by [bad] gameplay. I bought this and didn't even finish the game before I sold it. ...Please do yourself a favor and dont' buy this game - If you're a huge bond fan, then wait for the new one that is coming out later this year. The enemy AI is great in this game though, they sure do know how to run into walls for minutes on end. Oh and another funny thing, bullets seem to travel about as fast as a whiffle ball in this game. Someone could be 12 ""video game"" feet in front of you, but the bullets are soooo slow that they actually have plenty of time to avoid your shots (although it gets alot easier to hit them when they are continuously running face first into walls)..."
1,WORST GAME EVER,"If I could give this game a rating lower than one star, i would. If anyone gives this game a good review, it's because they don't know anything about first person shooters, and they're still caught up in the fact that it's James Bond and they haven't realized the game they're playing [is upsetting] yet. This game has difficult controls, sub-par graphics, and a horrible auto-aiming feature, making it near impossible to kill anyone. Also, when you do strike one of the ...AI in this game, it will have little or no effect. You'll find yourself unloading a whole clip to off one guy. This game is broken up every few stages with a car level, which are much, much more fun than the FPS stages, but it is still no excuse for the circular piece of dung that is Agent Under Fire. It'll cost more, but if you're looking for something like this, go pick up Halo and Spy Hunter. Otherwise, hitting yourself on the head with a tackhammer is more enjoyable than playing this game."
3,a decant bond game,"this bond game is a good one but with exceptions.there is problems with the AI like when i was hidding behind a box when a guy ran by me and shouted there he is, but the four other people just ran by. and the controls take a lot of getting used to and are very bad. This one is good if you are craving a first person shouter but it does not compare to halo."
3,Good Graphics Bad Gameplay,"I enjoyed this game, it was entertaining. The graphics were gorgeous and I loved driving the bmw in certain levels. However, the gameplay on this one was awful, it takes about four shots from the pk7 to down a guy, and after you hit them once or twice you wouldn't even have been able to tell. The machine guns fire all over the place and about 1 out of 5 bullets hit their target. It has a different story from any of the Bond movies and the story holds it own, however it doesn't offer anything new. I would recommend this as a rental, some people might like the way this game plays out with the driving levels and the especially nice cutscenes and graphics. For me however, give me Goldeneye."
5,An absolute delight!!!,"So much of Prokofiev is neglected. Although he is known for his more brash or playful features, he was a master at writing the elegant and bitter-sweet waltz. The waltz at the ball from War & Peace (track 5 on this disc) is simply wonderful (particularly in the inner string writing) and one of my absolutely favourite 20th century waltzes.So all the waltzes on this disc are wonderful, and very well performed and recorded here.Although I am a MEGA-fan of Shostakovich, both major and minor works, and his waltzes are great too, I would say that the Prokofiev ones here are often more profound in emotion.Anyway, a super collection of superb waltzes!"
2,invincible,"This was a bad idea. This was a really bad idea. This was a lazy idea. It was like he just wanted to put something out there. Anything, out there so he tried this. This does not work well."

3,Will hold your birdcages,"At $2.99 each, combined with the 4 for 3 and super saver promotions, you cannot go wrong with these if you need them. The wrought iron is thick and very strong. I'm guessing you could hold a 10 pound bird cage with this hanger, maybe more, assuming your tree branch can take that weight. The only thing that bothered me about this transaction is that I bought two of these, at the same time, same order, and there is no reason that Amazon couldn't have put them in the same box. Instead, they shipped them separately in huge boxes, with a ton of paper stuffing. This just seems very wasteful to me."
2,It's okay for some,"Okay fellas listen, If you want a realistic do not buy this game But if you think it is perfectly normal that a ford mustang R can catch a ferrari 360 or a Lamborghini police car can catch a Mclaren F1 LM car then this game is perfect for you..That's if you dont know about car stats. Also i personaly find it kind of dumb that the only cars with boost are the police car's, Which is the only reason these cars can catch high end cars such as the ones listed above. Again let's look at the reality aspect of this. You cant even buy Boost in this game which means that again this game is not realistic, I guess if i was 13 and just learning about cars this would be a great game but sadly thats to late. Go with a more realistic game such as NFSU Or NFSU2 Or NFSMW. Do not waist your time And no before you go looking i can tell you personaly there is not Codes or cheats to fix these problems because i have look all over for them. I hope this has helped"
2,Not Worth It,"Do not listen to all of the great reviews this game has been given. The concept to this game is great. The devolpers just didn't carry through. The game is just plain boring. All of the courses are very baren. The cops do the same thing every time. The graphics are great and the physics are great, but there is just no fun in this game after a couple days playing it. I know the game looks very appealing but save yourself and do not buy it. I do recomend renting it though. By doing that, the game will be lots of fun since there is absolutely no replay value to the game after a while."
1,sucks!!!!!!!!!!,this game is now where near as fun as the underground games. if you are going to buy this game get it for gamecube. need for speed hot persuit is a million times better on gamecube. you would think they would be the same. the gamesube one i would rate 5 stars the one for ps2 i would give a half a star.
5,Not the best but still my favorite!,"Gran Turismo is the best in terms of realism and racing simulation but for high adreneline, Need for Speed is tops! I like NFS better because the controls are a bit easier and control of the car is much more managable. In other words, where it takes lots of practice to get decent in Gran Turismo, you're up and cranking on NFS in no time!Need for Speed is so totally addictive it's unbelievable. I can literally play it for hours and have. The cars go wicked fast and it's fun to outrun cops, dodge barracades, do jumps while driving at high speeds. I haven't tried Underground yet but if it really is better like everyone says, I'll be looking forward to it coming down to the Greatest Hits collection (I NEVER buy games over $20)!"
3,Fun but annoying.,"The game is a very solid driver. I was floored by the graphics, sounds, and style of play. The only problem I had is it seems that the cops prefer to forget about all the other speeders and live to chase, box-in, block, and bomb you. On the off chance they do chase another driver, that's all they do. They chase them, but don't try to knock them off the road. Aside from that, it's awesome."
1,WORST GAME EVER,"This had to be the worst game that I have ever played. It might have been better if it were more challenging. I beet the game in a matter of minutes. Multiplayer even stunk. All you do is, drive while being timed and race 1 other truck. How boring is that.Most boring game ever!!!!!!!"
3,Save Your Money -- Unless Its for a Kid,"I had hoped that this game would be a next gen version of Prince of Persia, but all I got was a cross between a Mario-style game and a wanna be Third-Person shooter.The sea battles, though a cool idea, a less than spectacular -- its very difficult to manaveur the boats with speed and the action is very slow-paced.The game itself is very simple -- you run around killing pirates and finding treasures, but its just not that fun. Perhaps kids will like this because of the cartoon style drawing and that there is not too much blood shown, but adults -- well stick with Max Payne or Gunvalkerie.The graphics are very PS2ish and just does not seem on par with the XBOX's potential. My suggestion, rent it for your kids (if you have any) and then decide to buy it -- but if you don't have kids, stay away from this game."
3,"More like a brochure, but still smooth","While not as sturdily put together as past albums, the trio still offers a unique synergy with their Parisian-by-way-of-Texas sound. They do provide stimulating minimal avant-garde soundscapes, but fuller-fleshed out compositions would have rounded out BOS into a more complete experience."
4,Book of Silk,"I first heard this music in a videogame. It was so surreal, so haunting and dreamlike I had to have it. So I bought the album. The first 5 songs create an awesome dreamscape and allow the imagination to go wild. There is a song or two though that's little more than noise, but that can be easily overlooked. The last song is the only one that has vocals, and it makes you wonder why the rest don't. It's very beautiful and enjoyable. As someone who normally listens to rock, I can easily switch to this and be entertained."
3,Hard to swallow,"The quality is fine, as far as I can tell, but the form factor is atrocious. I don't have any trouble swallowing pills, and usually don't even bother to use water, but these are an unpleasant challenge. They're very large and have a rough dry surface. It takes a lot of effort to swallow them, and even washing them down with water, they *always* get stuck in my throat. I'm going to look for a brand that comes in capsules, even if they have a smaller dose. I'd rather take two or three capsules than one of these horse pills."
4,Not as easy as it seem.....,"I recently purchased this game, thinking that it won't be to complicated to play. Unfortunately, I can't get off the first level. After completing the first level, you fight a boss. In this case the first boss is a frog with a metal tongue, which I can't seem to beat. Also the 360 degree graphics, may cause you to get a headache, if you play for long periods. Not a bad game but may require cheat codes."
4,Ice Skating!,"Okay, this is not the Pac-Man you know. He's a platformer now! The highlight for me was the ice skating; i wish you could get him to do tricks or something! I spent a lot of time hopping, gliding, and trying to force him to do an axel. Kind of disturbing of me...Anyways, I probablt don't need to say that I liked this because it reminded me of Spyro, Ty, and a little of Klonoa. I didn't buy it because I got stuck and couldn't get past a part; this was a few years ago. :)"
4,Scope Cover,If you have even a decent scope it is worth protecting the glass. These do that great and keep your optics dust free!
5,"Stunning, inspring book!","I gave this book to my 12-year-old niece for her birthday, and she was awed by it. The photos are beautiful (and so are most of the women)! This book has a huge soul. I recommend it to everyone - man or woman, young or old - you'll be uplifted."
4,Romantic and slow,"This is a good set, but I think this CD is overrated. The tempo is a little slow and the performance is more ""romantic"", so it does not carry Ravel's coolness. Overall, good interpretation for those who like sweet, syrupy taste."
4,A Good Start,"This is a worthwhile effort in an under-studied area. Surely, poor whites are among among the most abused and least understood people in the United States. Moss lets a jargon-laden, deconstructionist (and not very useful) methodology intrude on his account, and he spends a lot of time reflecting on (and dramatizing) himself (an educated black man) in the context of poor whites. The conclusion is not enlightening, and the book seems to run out of steam near the end, offering no good insights into how the gulf between the poor of all backgrounds can be brought together in their struggle for fairness and opportunity. Kudus, though, for pointing out how bourgeois white self-congratulation for racial enligtenment serves their interests rather than those of minorities."
3,Just a'iiiight,"This game, being produced by EA Big Games, left me thinking it would be super cool, definitely close to NBA Street, and especially the SSX Snowboarding games. Dang, I was let down big time.The game is somewhat fun, and has good graphics. But it doesn't compare to the games mentioned above. Not even compared to the arcade snowrider games.I wouldn't recommend buying this, unless you are a hard-core fan of this genre.MC White said: It rocks!"
1,not worth the petroleum used to make the CD,"As the review title implies, I despise this game. Sled Storm for the PS2 is a huge disappointment. The graphics are ugly primary-color polygons with no texture, the tracks look like they were all stolen from SSX games, the ""snowmobiles"" sound like someone swatting at angry hornets with a rusty chainsaw, and the tracks are way too linear. No off-track exploration here, folks. If you see this game, just ignore it and walk away."
5,Marvellous,"Having done extensive research on fibroids and how to get rid of them, I've found this book to be most reader- friendly. I could relate to everything and appreciated the balance the writer used with medical explanations and natural remedies. I have already started using her methods and am looking forward to great results. The language used was simple and the personal experience was an eye opener to the fact that many doctors do not and cannot look beyond the hysterectomy death sentence simply because they do not want to. Rather than have a specific diet/ lifestyle plan, the book outlines which direction you should take and leaves it up to you to map out your own plan of action (not sure if this is a plus or negative, because I would have liked a Sunday to Monday meal plan, along with the natural remedy schedule.) Neverthless, I found this book most helpful in my personal fight with fibroids and am determined that it could be overcome without surgery."
1,Amazon's decription of this item are incorrect - BEWARE !,"Ok, I have given this title 1 star, not because it is not good, I know that it is, in fact it is a great series - the thing is that after buying the item from Amazon, I cannot actually play it because, contrary to Amazon's claims that the discs are playable in All Regions, I was very disappointed to find that they are coded Region 1. I have sent a complaint to Amazon and await to hear what they have to say for themselves.I am writing this review so that anyone who does not have a region 1 or multi-region player like me, will not make the mistake of buying this title - if you do, don't say you were not warned !!!"
2,Supercross Review,"I personally think this is one of the worst games ever. The graphcis are good but the gameplay [is not good]. It takes too long to get a stunt started, landing after going off of big jumps is near impossible, and for some reason during the race, the computer racers are able to crash into you and then keep riding, where you fall and lose positions. Try the game though, see if you like it or not. Though most of my friends and I hate it."
1,his Games is a BIG waste of money,At first when i rented this game i was excited becuase i like motocross games. I had recently played freekstytle on my friends ps2. That games was awesome. When i got home and put in jeremy mcgrath i did a freestyle course. Man did it suc. U really have no control over what trick you are going to do you just press buttons and it comes out. I thought the season mode was stupid because the games is trying to hard to be like tony hawk. Overal i think that it is a waste of money to even spend [$] for renting it.
4,"I wuvz them, yes I do!!!!!","The only reason I'm giving the a 4/5 is that the wrist strap - for me, anyway - needs to be shorter. I'm a smallish woman (5'2"" on a GOOD day), and these splints are solid, comfy, and give my poor, sore wrists the warm solid support they need. I've ordered a second pair (I've got them for both wrists) so I'm always covered even when one pair is air drying after cleaning.As for the too-long strap, I just picked out the stitches, cut off about 1/2"" of the strap, re-folded the strap, and then re-sewed the velcro patch on. It took about 5 minutes, and I'm a happy camper!"
1,Made matters worse,"I was going through physical therapy for elbow tendonitis when I started having symptoms in the middle of my forearm with finger movement. Puzzled by these new symptoms, my physical therapist suggested I get a wrist brace, which I did. Almost immediately the pain increased just at the base of where the brace ended on my arm. I abandoned use of it within less than 24 hours. The pain improved but did not go away. So I bought a night time wrist brace that also immobilizes the fingers to a certain degree and comes up much further on my arm. It is put out by Creative Comfort and is called a crafter's brace. I have been wearing it a minimum of 8 hours out of every 24 and limiting my typing. The pain is all but gone now. Very rarely do I feel it unless I spend too much time on my computer.So I would say, if your pain is in the middle of your forearm rather than closer to elbow or wrist, then you need a brace that is much longer than one of these or you may aggravate your symptoms more."
4,Solid product. 4+ stars Comfortable and actually works.,"Purchased for my wife, who has something akin to carpal tunnel - I have no idea how to spell it but it has to do with some tendon that runs from the elbow to wrist. Anyway after trying other wraps and braces and complaining about them all I purchased this for her But I digress.She says it is very comfortable and actually does work as described. It is even comfortable enough to sleep in.The picture leads you to believe it is longer than it actually is. But none the less, it does work quite well.A solid product."
2,It would be perfect if it came in different sizes,"This would be a nearly-perfect wrist brace if it fit correctly. Unfortunately, it is a little bit too small for my arms. It fits reasonably well around my hand but just barely closes around my (somewhat muscular, but not extremely large) forearm. Because of this, the whole thing just sits a little bit wrong.The item says that it is ""designed to fit women"", but I would alter that to say that it's designed to fit small women. It seems to be treated as a one-size-fits all item, which it definitely is not.Other than that, it's well-made and comfortable."
5,Steady and comfy,"Gives great support. Easy to wear or adjust. The metal support is well covered with cushion, so that it does not hurt. Great item!"
5,Great support!,"This brace has great support. The velcro tabs allow me to tighten this brace around my wrist tightly so that I cannot move it. Its padding is comfortable, there's no chafing, and the brace fits my small wrist perfectly. I have carpal tunnel, and this brace keeps my wrist from bending improperly and from being so sore. I notice when I forget to use it that my pain returns, so it must be doing its job! It's so great, I'm buying two! The extra cost in comparison with other braces on Amazon is worth it. I tried out another brace, but its material rubbed against my skin and the support was lacking. This brace is much higher in quality."
4,Helpful for individuals with carpal tunnel,I'm very happy with the overall support that this brace provides for my carpal tunnel pain. Does a great job in keeping my wrist steady and isn't super big and bulky and it still allows me to type on the computer.Only negative is the color. The color is a light grey and there is a white strip and considering I wear this often it does show dirt fairly well.Very helpful in minimizing my carpal tunnel pain but doesn't prevent it completely. Highly recommended though!
4,Best wrist support for computer use,"Have use this product for many years, keeps your wrist in place while working, and is best I have found for all day use with computer work."
5,comfortable,"I ordered a left & a right - the first left I received was very tight in the thumb-hole; I needed to exchange it. Second one was doable, not as roomy as the right one I received, but OK enough not to return for a second exchange. These are lightweight, comfortable and do give a firm support. These replaced older heavier ones I had worn to death and I was skeptical at first of their shorter & sleeker design, but I found them to be just as effective - and they fold up much nicer for traveling."
5,Fits comfortably even on large wrists,I love this product. I use it when I'm planning on doing a lot of mouse movements with a computer or when crocheting. I doesn't get in the way of my finger movements. I have a larger wrist than most women and it still fits comfortably.
2,"Great, for a while","I am a larger woman with very muscular forearms - you are probably safe ordering these in terms of size in general. However... While they seemed great for about a month, my hands/arms began to cramp during the night after using them beyond those first weeks. While I cannot explain why, it is worth mentioning. For that reason, I will return to the Ace TekZone supports - the Velcro gives out after 6 months of nightly use but they work without pain."
4,Comfy and Supportive,This is perfect. It gives great support and doesn't chafe. The only suggestion is that they make the splint that supports the thumb a bit softer.
5,Very good!!!,"I use this wrist support for sleep and helps me a lot!!! Is very, very comfortable, beautiful and durable!!! I have one for almost one year and is still beautiful!!!"
2,"Felt great, broke quickly.","This wrist brace was very comfortable and was helping my wrist feel better after long days of using the computer. I was very happy with it. However, after a few months, the hard plastic insert that keeps your wrist from bending too much snapped from normal use. Now it is useless. Overall, not worth the money if you need it for more than two months."
5,Lets me type again!,"I was given a wrist brace at the doctor's office that basically let me do nothing- typing, holding things, etc. and as a result I rarely use it. I decided to try this brace after reading the reviews, and I'm glad I did. I am able to type this review because of the brace! It supports my wrist (I have the beginnings of carpal tunnel) without completely restricting movement. This is so important to me, as my job is on the computer, and my hobby (digital photography) keeps me on there when I am at home. Plus, it is a lot easier on the eyes than the huge bulky tan one. This fits under my clothing too. I recommend this for any woman w/ carpal tunnel issues."
4,Awesome but for everyday use doesnt last long,"I love wellgate products, I also use their ankle supports because I have very weak ankles from 12 years of tennis. But back to the wrist brace, I have tendonitis from over use and my doctor told me to use a brace while I sleep so that I don't hurt it while sleeping. This brace works great but when using everyday, it probably only lasts 2-3 months before the part where the velcro sticks to right at the wrist gets deformed and doesnt grip well. The bottom velcro part seems to last forever but the top part doesnt and you cant just replace the top one you need to buy a whole new one. So at $18 a pop it seems a but expensive but it does work well."
5,great,after reading reviews for a number of wrist splints I decided to go with this one...I am extremely satisfied....It fits just right and I immediately noticed a change in my carpel tunnel....
2,Not so great,"I bought this as a back-up for the brace I already own- theFuturo For Her Wrist Support, Adj. Right. I wear my Futuro most of the day and also overnight so I needed one to wear while the other was being washed and air-dried. Based on the other reviews I read, I thought this would be a nice brace, but after wearing it for the last few hours I'm pretty disappointed. It's not the worst brace I've ever owned but it doesn't compare to the Futuro. This one doesn't keep my wrist very stable- I still have a lot of mobility. It's also pretty uncomfortable and the upper edge hurts my hand. Think I'll be returning this and getting another Futuro. The Futuro costs more but is WELL worth it- I wear it about 18-20 hours each day and it keeps my wrist very stable and is MUCH more comfortable than this one."
5,Better than others,Provides excellent support with plates on both on top an under your wrist. I have a small hand and find this product fits better than other supports for 'women'.
2,okay,Didn't fit to any of my TV's but realized after I ordered that I ordered the wrong adapter! But great quick efficient shipping of the item!
1,Beautiful but dumb...,"This timer is such a good idea, and it looks great. The color is very pretty and looks wonderful in my kitchen. I am returning it however, because it is inaccurate. I've followed the directions for setting it and checked it against my old timers and the clock, and it is routinely several minutes slow. MINUTES! Plural! I can't cook with that. The buzzer has an unpleasant sound, too, but I could have gotten used to that. This same timer was for sale in the Williams Sonoma catalog awhile ago (they now have a different model), so i figured it was a quality item. It sure looks classy, tho! Sigh."
2,Whole Foods needs to Update their Cookbook,"I knew the copyright of the book, but I just assumed I would find what I found on the salad bar. I was disappointed. They need to do an update of this book"
3,its ok,I am disappointed in the cookbook. Its not what I expected from Whole Foods. I think it could have been better in drawing you in to make the recipes.
5,a great tool,"This is great, I bought a few different tools from this company for my wife, an avid gardner, she love em, likes how they work, feel and, look.. Got these very quickly too.. would buy again from seller."
2,PERSONAL recording only,"This is my first digital voice recorder, so I can't compare it with others.I use an old Sony MD player/recorder to record class lectures. The quality is excellent, however, there's no usb connection, so I'd have to play back the lecture into the PC to record it.I bought this recorder as a refurbished item, but I assume the recording/playback quality is the same as new.If you use this device for personal memos, it will work just fine. The device needs to be a few inches away from the mouth. However, when recording from a distance (ie for a lecture), the recording quality diminishes greatly. You can still hear the content, but it comes across distant and a bit fuzzy.I'm gonna stick with the MD recorder for now."
3,WARNING LABEL,"This is a warning to all consumers. This product's USB cable contains lead. This is clearly labeled on the back of the box, ""Please wash your hands after using this product,"" but not on this web-site.If you have small children or were planning on giving this to a child, please do not.-- Joseph Hawkins"
2,"Gets the job done, but does it half [way]","This will get the job done on most games, however if you want to play games like Street Fighter or any other game that requires directional based special moves, you can forget it.Software on the site allows you to program special move buttons.The buttons are terrible. They 'mush' down. They are not springy as they should be."
2,Decent controller except for the d-pad,"After getting tired of using the keyboard for playing games, I picked up this gamepad thinking that it may help. I was wrong. After a hour or so of playing and getting more and more frustrated, I finally tossed the controller to the back of my desk.The Gravis Gamepad is roughly the same size and shape of the Sony Playstation controller, a design that sits well in your hands. It has four face buttons and another four shoulder buttons, plus the usual start and select buttons. The directional pad though is very different. The d-pad seems to misread where you are actually moving it, instead of moving straight up, it will read it as a diagonal direction.Pros:Similar in size and layout to the Sony Playstation controller.USB interfaceCons:The directional pad is possibly the worst that I have ever used.Feels a bit flimsyThis gamepad is not too bad if you can overlook the directional pad's flaws. But you might be better off spending your money elsewhere."
4,"Insatiable, smoldering underground Victorian erotica...","I don't read a lot of Blue Moon books and I especially don't read books written by anonymous authors, but this novel was too smoldering to resist. A Stately English Mansion is a classic erotic novel written during the Victorian era. It tells the story of a young woman who lets loose after she takes the reins of the English mansion she works in. She becomes a rather interesting dominatrix with the employees, home's family members and the neighbors. The unidentified author takes this tale to erotic heights I have seldom read. I would have liked to know who the author of this wonderful novel is, for this is a true Victorian classic, but I guess that holding on to this wonderful book will have to suffice. I cannot recommend it enough!"
1,Incestual and Disturbing,"What started out as a somewhat stimulating and erotic read quickly turned into a nightmare. Incest and pediphilia are not what I consider ""erotica""."
2,Disapointing,"When i got this gun i thought it would be amazing. Well, i was wrong. I took it out of the box and it was perfect. But then after a month it started to lose its FPS. then i just broke."
4,Could be better,The game is a great fast paced fighting game. Morphing into animals or beast form to fight with is even better. There are some things I like and somethis I dislike about this game.Things I like1. Awesome environments with destructable arena walls.2. Nice looking characters.3. A variety of different fighting styles.Things I dislike1. Not enough characters. How hard can it be to come up with a new character. I've played this game on the 2 other systems also. Both PS2 and XBOX and they all seem to have the same characters. If they can give the game a different title for diffent systems then why not more characters?2. Music? very repetitive. Get a better selection of music.3. Well I don't really have a 3rd dislike. I've pretty much covered my dislikes. ( but a penguin? come on. Might as well put a frog or toad on here too or how about a gnat? Ha )
5,16 year old GCN gamer,I think Bloody Roar: Primal Fury is one of the best fighting games I've ever played. I'm not a really big fan of the fighting games but this really impressed me. The graphics are killer and the control play is great. The sound could use a little more work but overall it's a must have game.
5,this game freekin' rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"finally, a motocross game that is fast and fun! it feels like you are going 200 mph! i've played all of the others and they were slow and ugly expecially the carmichael mx games. the graphics are rad, probably the best i've seen on my ps2. freeksytle was a blast from the start. the characters were funny - deegan rulez and leeann is hot!go out and get your own copy or you will miss out on the best moto racing game ever!"
1,Mansion of the Boring Dead,"If this movie was any worse, it couldn't have been made. It works neither as a horror movie nor as a porn movie. It's too stupid to be scary. It's too ugly to be erotic. If Franco wanted to make soft-core porn, why didn't he at least pick better-looking actresses for the four strippers? Jeeeesus, Franco!--Bryan Cassiday, author of ""Fete of Death"""
3,very handsome & secure earrings,"I bought these for the screw-on backs because the regular backs sometimes came undone during sleep. These are very handsome and never come undone. I actually like them better than the 7 mm earrings I bought earlier.UPDATE:These gold round balls are hollow & the screw-on backs so tiny that it's difficult to screw them on to the earring posts. I ordered these to replace a 7mm pair whose screw-on back came off after a relatively short time. I ordered these as a replacement, but couldn't put on myself [my very arthritic hands are deformed and insensitive]. For awhile my husband would put them on for me, but then said it was too difficult, so I had to stop wearing them. They are so light-weight that it would take at least 22 pairs to achieve the minimum pennyweight to sell them as scrap gold."
5,Best thing since sliced bread,"This game is brilliant, the crashes are wicked!I have been playing it solidly for about a month now and its still great.i would recommend everyone plays this, the action is 100% hardcore, the most fun you can have with your clothes on."
5,una jalada de ganzo.,"especial burla y toques sarcasticos. algunas bandas lo tomaron como debe de ser. otras se pusieron muy en su papel y no le metieron ese toque de ironia. la vida es sarcastica, especialmente bajo las influencias del alcohol. un saludo al principe. el diseño de la caratula es bueno pero podria ser mejor, la tipografia--nada que ver."
4,Nice product!,"I have been using this product on my truck tonneau cover for several months. It does a nice job of protecting as well as making the cover look new at all times. The Arizona dust wipes off without a problem. It is a little pricy, but if you shop around and buy in larger quantities it's not to bad."
5,Best ever!,"I use it on the car trims, the engine, the dash, my shoes also! give a nices low sheen look, long lasting and does not vanish in a week!"
1,"Claims to protect against UV light, it does not!","I bought this product to protect my canvas gazebo from sun damage. I have a 10' x 13' canvas over aluminum frame gazebo that needed a replacement canopy after 2 years in my yard. The new canopy cost just over $100. I purchased the 32oz bottle of this 303 product hoping to get an extra year or 2 out of the canopy.I have my doubts that this product is prolonging the life of the canopy. Here is why. I applied the product on only 3 sides(1 long,2 short) of the canopy because I ran out and did not want to spend another $30(I may have over-applied). It is now 4 months later and I can visually see no difference between the ""protected"" sides and the unprotected side. They are all equally (very) faded.If I cannot tell the difference at an advanced stage of fading as this, I do not see the sense in wasting my money on this ever again."
5,"Protects great, but has a shelf life of a couple years","I used to buy it by the gallon but the product mildews after a couple years. Now I buy small bottles. I use it for my S2000 top, tires, and anything rubber or soft plastic. Runs onto the windows a bit after the first rain, but the benefits outweigh the inconvenience."
5,Great Product!,High Tech Fabric Guard is a great product to waterproof various fabrics left outdoors and to also protect them from UV rays of the sun. We have had 'sun rot' attack our outdoor swing fabric and we purchased this product to protect our new swing fabric. We also have fabric awnings and an outdoor umbrella all made with Sunbrella brand fabric which is very expensive. This product is actually 'recommended' by the Sunbrella factory to help waterproof and to protect their fabric products from 'sun rot' due to UV rays. I have been recommending this to all of our friends here in our park to help protect their outdoor fabrics as well.
5,Better than the rest!,I have been using this product for over 4 years. Excellent stuff. Stays on for a long time. A little spray covers a lot of area. Keeps my interior of car clean and safe from sunlight. I live in area where summers are long and hot (over 100 degrees).Have no complaints.
4,303 Protectant,"I bought this product after reading reviews from different web sites. I have only used it once, but I am OK with it."
2,Marvel for Dummies,"The book looks great, the problems start when you search for information on a caracter and you only find the ones you already know. I understand that Marvel dedicate more space to it's icons, but it's illogycal to exclude 80% of your caracters, even if they are well know outside the comic comunity (Apocalyps, Mr. Sinester, Hobgoblin, Tigra, Machineman, Valder, Mr Hyde, Omegar Red, Lady Deathstrike, etc).Almost every art piece has already been publish, and the ones who haven't are not very good (Quicksilver and Scarlet Wish).The information is scarce to say the least, and the recomended reading is almost limited to recent issues.Sometimes the power level of the caracters dosen't make any sense. (according to the guide Jubilee has more energy than Gambit).If you have never read a Marvel Comic this might be your cup of tea, otherwise don't buy it."
1,Unremarkable,"I am a new teacher (recently graduated from college) who was looking for a helpful, inspiring, and fresh-faced book about education. This book failed to deliver. I found the author's style hard to read and digest. There was little discussion about practical applications or approaches present in the text. Instead, the author dwelled on abstract theory without offering much in the way of advice/help/direction. The theories presented had already been exposed to me during my collegiate career. In summary, if you are a somewhat recent graduate you will probably find little use for this book. If you are a layperson, you may find it difficult to read. If you are a veteran teacher, you may find the text helpful in refreshing your fluency in educational theory."
2,Give Me a Break On The Setup Menu,"I got this machine to replace my 20 year old VCR that was eating tapes. Since I don't use a VCR that much I figured how could I go wrong. WrongThe one thing I have to have is my TIVO macine, which I bought at Amazon over 3 years ago and love. I have the TIVO machine hooked up with an A/B box along with the VCR/DVD. I got all the wires hooked up and everything kinda worked to I started playing with the setup menu. The setup menu is way to hard to figure out. I have to press the input button to get some things to register and nowhere in the instructions does it tell you that. I am an engineer and can usually figure these thing out. I spent 20 minutes to change from daylight savings time to standard time. The setup menu is not intuitive and way too complicated.I can't play the VC-Rs and the DVD-Rs that I make on my computer on the machine so that is another minus.Keep looking"
1,Seemed like a good idea at the time,"I bought this unit really cheap on closeout at an unnamed local chain (that also sells pretty good tools). Then we moved our Sony combo upstairs. I loved the remote but then noticed these faint, flashing diagonal lines (that started to drive me crazy) and it would not play tapes from the Sony combo that it replaced well even using manual tracking. I tried different connections and settings to no avail. The eject mechanisms sounded clunky and after reading the reviews it got on my nerves.Well I took it back after 2 weeks to the local store and for just a few dollars more got a Sony combo on sale. Even though it has the teeny-weeny buttons the picture and sound rock. Thank You!!!"
1,Avoid at all costs,"Had this DVD/VCR combo for 11 months and it worked ok, though it got very light use on our second TV.Then a piece of plastic broke on the vcr mechanism and the shop wanted $65 to repair (woohoo--the parts were under warranty, that was just for labor). I'd paid $140 from Amazon when it was new.Consumers should not put up with this shoddy quality.Wish there had been more reviews at the time. Am so disappointed in the JVC (the J stands for JUNK!) brand, needless to say I'll not be buying any of their lousy products in the future."
3,It's okay...,"I bought this game first, when it first came out. It was okay, but I didn't really enjoy it. There are a lot of different controls you have to remember, which I didn't like. The one thing I liked was the different players it has on it. If you want a tennis game that out does all the tennis games out there, you have to play Sega Sports Tennis! It's so easy to play and so much more fun!! I sold WTA as soon as I played Sega Sports Tennis... it was a lot more fun!:)"
2,Predictable,It's fun -- just way to easy -- all you need is good timing to crush even the likes of Serena 6/0 6/0! Even in the most difficult mode.My major complaint -- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW MONICA SELES AT NET? Drives me crazy that every opponent comes to net (even when you're hitting deep shots!). Makes it predictable.If you are looking for something that makes you think strategically -- this is not a game for you!
5,A Wonderful Film that Has Been Forgotten,"Turtle Diary is a wonderful human story about isolated people coming together in a situation set in motion by the protagonist (Kingsley) and who discover depths in themselves they hadn't know or had forgotten. There is emotion here, but it is never sentimental and the characters are wonderfully realized by a cast of remarkable actors. It is incomprehensible to me that this film has not been released on DVD. Kingsley gives a very moving performance, as do Glenda Jackson, Michael Gambon and the rest of the cast, in roles their current fans would be surprised to see. I highly recommend this film and also fervently recommend its release on DVD."
4,Beware.. this is NOT coming with Dragon software,"After hours of research for buying a digital voice recorder with voice to print for my lectures at school, I found out only Sony offers so far. But beware, this IST10 doesn't come with Dragon Naturally Speaking software (as one reviewer mentioned as I've the same purpose as him) but compactable with it. You have to choose either ICD-ST10VTP ($50 more)or ICD-MS515VTP to get Dragon preferred 7 software,otherwise, purchase software seperately. Bundle package is cheaper than purchase software separately. Good luck for your research!"
2,"Great recorder, lousy warranty","While my recorder worked I loved it. My wife bought it for me as a gift since I was always jotting notes on paper and losing them. This recorder was great for clipping to my shirt pocket and pulling out when I wanted to make a note of something to do. That is right up until one day the record feature stopped working. I had only had it three months. When my wife called the company they said it would cost $[price] to just take a look at it. This did not include any additional labor cost or shipping. Parts were covered since it was less than a year, gee thanks. Why isn't labor covered? Is Sony contracting out so much to cheap labor that they are not doing the quality work? I have seen numerous complaints like mine that indicate they are not interested in customer service. For this price wouldn't you agree it should have a year labor warranty as well?"
1,Murder to install on windows ME,"Tried to install this joystick on my Dell 1gig computer and with all instructions from Gravis, Dell and Microsoft web sites the joystick would not install with windows ME, even with the Gravis patch. Tried again on a new HP computer, it would not install."
1,Not fun,"Learn by dying/failing, and when you fail you go all the way back to the beginning. That's a rather bad game design philosophy."
4,maximo... to save or not to save?,well at first i was totally [mad] at the game ... im an old school gamer and paying to save blew me away! i couldnt believe it!... but i got a game shark and cheated to my hearts content and viola! a good game! has lots of replay value once you get over the stupid idea of paying to save....
5,"A good, fun challenge!","Some folks gave this game a poor rating. I would suspect they are into instant gratification. This games takes a some work at first. That's what makes it a great game. It's not as fluffy and gentle as ""Jack & Daxter"".PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT CAMERA ANGLES: press L1 to rotate the camera behind the player.EVERYBODY: Read the manual before playing. It's not long."
5,Great Game,"This is an awesome fun filled game. It's a nice break from all these modern games where the screen is so crazy and you have to have 10 hands to work the controls. It's simple, great graphics, fun and entertaining. My husband bought it my accident and we had a blast playing it. Highly suggested."
3,Common now,"I rented this game and I played it for a good chunk of time when I realized I was doing the same darn things over in each level. I know there are different moves he gets, but common! That doesn't make a great game. so if you play this game, after a while into it you will notice your eyelids getting heavy, you will yawn a few times then realize that this game is more than a bit repeatative in each level. then, if your like me you'll put it away and forget you even bought the thing because there is nothing that should grab your attention in maximo. If you want a good slice and dice game go out and get devil may cry. if you already onw devil may cry then what do you want with maximo? there is nothing that would make me want to buy maximo."
4,BOO!,"Horrible! I love the resident evil games, but this one sucks. When you are battling a zombie you are taken to first person shooting. I think it was a big mistake."
3,have not played,i will review this later anyway the story is great but the game is way to much to buy people are getting ripped off buying this game from people who charge high it costs so much! right now its 24.99$ so you should probaly search around for it at game stores i will review this game when i buy this game i post this message that way buyers will hopefuly lower there prices
4,Who Could Hate It?,"I used to rent this game all the time and now I finally own it! It is the best game Ive ever played with the graphics at top notch. Your enemies know what theyre doing and they have high A.I. The missions are great. My favorites are D-Day and Nijmegen Bridge. This game cannot get any better, and whoever hates it needs a brain. There are some glitches, like on the mission Derailed! you shot a guy up in a tower and he starts to fall but stops in mid-air with his legs flailing. I really like this game but the sequel MOH Rising Sun really needs improved. What happened to the Panserschreck? Anyway, this game really shows you what soldiers had to do to succeed in WW2.MOH lovers, this is for you!"
4,Medal of Honor is the Best!!!!!!!,"Medal of honor is the best WW2 game ever. Its interesting and fun. You could fight in D-Day. The guns are the M1, Thompson, springfeild, bazoka, and the silenced pistol. There are others but i forgot them. Buy it."
5,Great Heros,"This is a really good game. You can be a hero of WW2... every kids dream. I played Medal of Honor Allied Assualt (wich is the same thing)and it sent such a surreal feeling through my body, I felt like I was on that battle field. Such a feeling made me realize what war is about, and that war isnt fun. But as long as im making a difference in America(whether is virual or actual) I am proud that that difference is for the best country in the world. So buy this game and fel like youve made a difference."
3,OK,"MOH:Frontline isn't bad I guess. It's pretty fun, especially the first mission, but it would have been a lot more realistic with some blood. I'm not sick or anything, but when you shoot somebody, they're gonna bleed. Another thing is why the hell do I have to shoot everybody 3 times before they die. It's kinda stupid to shoot a guy in the face at point-blank range and watch him get up again. This game is ok but only buy it used if you really must have it."
2,Just can't AIM!,"I played Call of Duty on PC and I was in AWE! So I got this Medal of Honor game for GameCube. I thought playing a game without a keyboard would be best...but I am wrong. Trying to aim in this game is ""THE"" challenge. I lose patience and turn it off before I even get deep into a level because it is hard to aim at those who are shooting at you. On the PC you can get the cross hairs between the eyes, but on the former... you kinda' just have to swing the cross hairs while in rapid fire hoping it will strike your target somewhere. Shooter Games will no longer be bought for my game console...I'll just stick with my PC :)"
3,Dull,"I'm shocked to find myself dissapointed at this game. There are developers who clearly have a fine attention to detail and the right attitude about making games, but there is no cooperative two player, no multiplayer at all, the map designs are rather linear and don't lend themselves to exploration, the game is unplayable without a dual shock controller, and finally, MoH: Allied Assault and MOH Underground were better! Get those instead."
4,MOH: Frontline FINALLY ON PS2,"Alright so I bought Frontline and I have to say its an amazing game. First of all the graphics are great. Theres nothing bette than watching some nazi's facial expressions before capping him off. The missions are addicting yet still difficult. All in all it a great game to play. The only major flaw with this game is I was very upset that there was no multiplayer option. Oh well hopefully on the next one I'll be able to ghat out my friends, and with any luck Sony will make it online compatible."
4,pretty good,"this game,for the most part,is pretty good.I hate most first person shooters but the first mission was visually awesome in the beginning,although the missions do get very annoying.The graphics are great,im surprised they could have all that action on screen with good graphics and still make the game run smoothly.In my opinion,on the downside is that the game litterly copies all WWII movies in existence.The first mission is a pefect replica of saving private ryan while the sumbarine one has U571 written all over it.Theres also a snpiering level that bears a uncanny resemblence to enemy at the gates.But if u can get past that tiny bit of cinematic nostalgia,youll have a perfect way to alleviate boredom during the year."
2,What a PAIN!,"If you love spending hours to complete a mission only to be killed just before completing it, then having to go through the mission again, and again, and again, you'll love this game. I didn't. Some levels were easy, but others got ridiculous. I hate games without save points within missions. I've also decided I don't like first person shooters. Most of all, I don't like Torture, and that's what this game became. I did, however, enjoy Medal of Honor: Rising Sun. It had save points."
1,Waste of money,I was very disappointed in this game. I think it is the worse game I own. Very hard to learn and very limited in adventure.
3,medal of honor frontline too short,Having beat the game I think it should have been a little longer.As soon as I was getting hooked on the game it was over.
3,A tired retread of a very good game,"What this game has improved on since the 2 previous MOH titles on PSX include:* graphics are much better* enemy animations and sound are generally better* enemy AI is slightly improvedThat's about it. The mission designs aren't improved at all. Only one or two spots are even interesting (the opening mission is quite nice but then it's straight into the retread). The control system, if anything, is worse (though you can resort to the original setup) and the aiming is really jerky. It compares unfavorably to other games that use a similar system like Syphon Filter.So, in short, if I had never played the first MOH games, I would have thought this was a 4 or 5 star game. Since it is basically a rehash of the originals, though, it is fun but often tiresome and has no replay value whatsoever."
5,Very realistic!,"This game is fun.The D-day mission is just like the movie ""Saving Private Ryan"".This game also has real guns from world war 2.Such as the B.A.R.,M1 garand,Thompson submachine gun,MP-40,STG-44,Bazooka,Panzerschreck,and many more.I have played all the missions in the game.Your main object is to steal the HO-IX,which is on the last level.The HO-IX looks like a stealth bomber.If I were you,I would rent the game first."
5,Extremely nice watch,"I bought my watch 6 months ago. It's a fine piece of art. Very high quality and state-of-the-art design. It has a sapphire cristal, very resistant to scratches. Nice, good looking, easy to use, it's the perfect watch for a Formula 1 lover."
5,A neccessity when losing an infant child.,"I have owned this book for seven years, since the loss of my daughter.It was sent to me by the author when I called her at home and asked for guidance.It has been THE most comforting book to me... Sherokee offers insight that we are unable to think of at the time of our sorrow.At the time of the death of my child, I had NO idea anyone else knew what I was going through...But someone does.There could have been no other author, no other book, that could have given me the strength that I received from this.At a time when I was so at a loss for words, Ms. Ilse spoke, not only for me, but to me, to tell me I was not alone.Ms. Ilse gave me the strength through this book, to do what I needed to do, and then take care of myself.This book was an essential part of my of my healing... I cannot say enough about the book, or the author."
1,THE UNHOLY GRAIL,"My mother always told me if I couldn't say something nice about somebody, don't say anything at all. With that in mind, I will say CUP OF MY BLOOD has an original premise. Too bad the script doesn't live up to its expectations. The acting isn't the worst I've ever seen, but it's not far from it. Filmed on a tight budget, one could have expected lower production values, but they couldn't get much lower. Sex fans may find the heavy breathing simulated sex scenes erotic, although I found them tiresome and oblique. Murky and vague, CUP OF MY BLOOD brings nothing new to an ailing horror genre, and is certainly not worth buying, rent if you can't find something better."
4,Dark & Brooding (Low Budget) Horror,"""Cup Of My Blood"" combines a few different genres to create a unique movie experience.Writer/Director Lance Catania uses a gloomy look to present his story, which can best be descibed as ""The Da Vinci Code"" meets ""The Evil Dead"".And NO, I'm not comparing ""Cup Of My Blood"" to those classic films, but story-wise it has that kind of vibe happening.The acting is a mix-mash of talent, some outstanding and others a bit stiff, but over-all effective in this context. The cinematography looks fantastic, and keeps an eerie feeling of dread present at all times.With a mix of politics, porn, love and demonic possesion, you can't go wrong for your Indie dollar."
4,I'm having fun,"The game doesn't have that many options and it's kind of repidative but I'm having fun playing it. Basically you're a girl pirate you have a ship and a sword and your dad dies. Ya kinda sucky but you start going around beating people down.The ship concept is awesome, basically you start out with a ship with 2 cannons then you get more money and your ship gets bigger and you get alot more cannons. How many more cannons you ask? Well a big boat holds 50 cannons per side, not bad... Oh ya you get different thingies (Sorry can't remember what they're called) to put on the front of your boat. Like one lets you ram other evil boats, one lets you shoot lightning cannons balls etc...I like the ship concept better then playing as the girl, but shes pretty cool, she gets two swords and you get different betters swords as the game progresses. The fighting style is like fencing, it looks pretty coolWell that's all I have, I liked it and had fun playing it."
3,Not the Pirates of old,"I purchased Pirates - The Legend of Black Kat thinking that it would be along the lines of the old Nintendo Pirates game. My mistake - just reading a few reviews would have helped. The overall concept is good, blending the land and sea facets of the game well. The graphics for Kat and the sea battles are very good and up to my standards for PS2 games. A lot more tweaking could go into the maps as they are not very clear. The instructions, too, are a little vague."
3,"Too minimal, I think","I wasn't very impressed with Falconer. Other than a few short stories, it's the only thing I've read by Cheever. I bought it at a second hand store, mainly because the cover featured a giant asterisk which announced ""Winner of the Pulitzer Prize."" Its ambiguous placement led me to believe the book itself won, although I now know it was referring to Cheever only, as he won for The Collected Stories (which seems like a cop-out way to win, don't you think?). The story had its high points (""I'm intensely interested in what happens next,"" I believe was how the warden put it), but I certainly didn't feel it lift my soul, or even, for that matter, challenge the way I looked at or felt about life. I don't think anybody should to go out of the way to add this to their hallowed shelf."
4,Liked it!,"Beautifully descriptive (though a somewhat dismal, depressing subject). Kept me rivetted well into the night. I highly recommend this book."
4,Brilliant playing,"Arensky's trio #1 has to be one of the most lovely pieces ever written! The second movement in particular is extremely beautiful and very difficult to play well. The Borodin Trio does a superb job. I bought this CD after listening to the second movement played on all the CDs in Amazon and the Borodin Trio are the only ones who play it really well. The second trio isn't as good as the first, but the first definitely makes it worth buying this CD."
3,Hard to get used to ...,"seeing Gladys George start off in this movie as the wife of a wealthy French lawyer, since the only other two times I'd seen her, she was far less lofty: she's the Woman Who REALLY Loves James Cagney's Eddie Bartlett in ""The Roaring Twenties"" and has a much smaller role as Dana Andrews' broken down stepmother in ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" . So here, she's the unfaithful wife who must leave her home never to return in order to protect her husband's career and her son's place in society. Warren Williams turns in an appropriately starchy performance as her unsympathetic husband, but it's Henry Daniell who really steals the show as a dastardly fellow blackmailing Madame X about her real identity. Not bad at all."
1,Swing this out your window,"I love Paul Anka. I love the songs. But the mesh of the two was a disaster. The rhythms and the essence of the music seem to disappear, and the orchestra's interludes (same old same old) are too strong and common. Don't waste your money."
1,Just Shoot Me!!!,"As Frank Barone would say, ""Holy Crap!!!"" That would pretty well sum it up for me. Is Paul Anka's repertoire of music so bankrupt that he has to resort to cranking out this tripe?? Puhleaseeeeeeeeeeee Paul, get a grip. You are much better than this. Canadians everywhere are grimacing and groaning with each track played. Maybe if you are completely drained of anything more to say musically, you might want to consider retiring altogether, because I don't see any resurgence in your career by putting out drivel like this. Don't get me wrong, the songs are great, when performed by those who should be performing them, but please Paul, stick to what you know. This hurts my ears"
3,Is he serious?,"When I first heard Teen Spirit on radio I cracked up and looked up Mike Flowers. Then I learn that it is not the master of parody up to no good, but a voice I had not heard in decades, Paul Anka. His rendition of Spandau Ballet's True made my sides split. The only scary thing is, unlike Flowers, I think he is serious about all this...."
3,Sometimes newer is not better,"I wish Mr. Anka would have stuck with what I had come to love.....His protege, Michael Bublé proved that staying true to timeless classics with the emphasis on sweet sounds works better."
2,Is It Intentionally Cheesy?,"Paul Anka knows his way around a big band, and around a great song -- he's written many of them. What happens when a talented singer nearing Medicare age decides to ""get hip"" singing the songs ""the kids are listening to today?"" Richard Cheese (a bit younger) makes a whole career doing just that, and the results are hilarious. When Paul Anka does it, the results are just as funny. Imagine ""Eye of the Tiger,"" ""Everybody Hurts,"" amd ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" with a swinging big band. Yes, it's funny. But was Anka being funny intentionally? The world may never know.Still, if you love big band and swing, and you can appreciate irony, you'll enjoy this CD."
1,An insult to rock.,"Keep out of my genre, grandpa!This guy thinks he can come in, take respected rock songs and go ""hey, I can make this soooo much better if I convert this into my genre!"" Fat chance. He murdered ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" because he knew nothing about the song. He merely read a lyrics sheet. The song is all about teenage angst, anger and depression. It's full of emotion. He takes it and reads the lyrics slowly while a jazz band plays in the background. This means that he turned the song into an empty shell. The lyrics meant nothing because HE didn't know what they meant.Others such as ""Jump"" are exactly the same.Don't buy this. Get the actual songs or, if you were looking for a parody, buy Wierd Al Yankovic!"
2,Don't know if I like this or not,"His voice sounds great, the band sounds great. But when he sings ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and the lines ""I feel stupid and contagious"", well it just sounds silly. Same with a lot of the other songs."
3,Sublime to Ridiculous!,"If anything . . . this album must be purchased for the pure joy in hearing your favorite ""rock"" songs turned into ""swing"". Don't get me wrong, swing lovers will actually LIKE this album from one of their greatest heroes, but rock lovers . . . well, they'll have a hearty laugh with their friends for the first few listens then find some ""old"" person for whom they need a last minute gift.Seriously though, the brutally fiendish, yet hilarious, rendition of Alice in Chains ""Man in a Box"" or the equally charming version of Metallica's ""Enter Sandman"" will make the kids howl . . . but soon they'll return to the far, far better originals. This is their parents golden opportunity to actually HEAR the vocals from their kids' favorite screamers!"
1,Lounge Rules! But not here...,"Maybe it's just the Amazon samples, but all of the tracks sound very much the same. Very bland. The attempt to be original has rendered the songs unrecognizable and I can only recommend this CD for those needing a background soundtrack for sleep.Paul jumps on the Lounge Cover bandwagon and then disses other artists on the radio? I would even recommend the poorly recorded Bud E. Luv covers over this tripe. And, of course, the Richard Cheese CDs are FAR better than ANY of them and carries the edge of recognizable arraingements and lyrics.In short, I'd save your money for the good stuff, and this isn't it."
1,Just Sick and Wrong,"In my opinion this CD completely desecrates the hallowedness of the original songs. I like swing and the usual standards, but Anka should stick with what he does best and get away from his desires to be a rock star."
1,"Uh, NO!","Didn't he learn from the debacle that was Pat Boone's attempt at this same thing a few years ago (look up Amazon ASIN B000005KOE)?These kinds of albums are really an affront to the original versions. Now before you write me off as some kook who refuses to like covers. I love covers. I have many tribute albums and several albums that have covers of other people's bands. But there are times that you change them so much that you might as well have not bothered doing a cover in the first place. That's what this is. Most of these are totally unrecognizable from the original versions. I don't know what the actual point is here.I listened to all the samples, and quite honestly, I can't see how it would make someone want to buy the album - the majority of the music here sounds completely similar, which is not the case if you listened to all of these songs in their original form.Sorry, can't help you with this thing."
4,Useful advice,I have found the information quite useful. It gives you clear instructions on how to get control over your stressors. It is written in a simple and logical format. I have enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to others.
3,Objective Tp A Point,"This book offers a neophyte to the Mormon religion and people a good deal of insight and a great dealof accurate historical data though that data is sometimes sanitized or abridged.It is well written and easy to understand. Very objective through most chapters and quite informative. It does become apologetic both for and against the Church Of latter Day Saints thus losing objectivity and credibility along the way. It seems tha authros were trying too hard to be objective and thereby muddled their message.I would strongly recommend this book for anyone just starting their research into Mormonism. It's objectivity, thought limited and historical accuracy make it a great place to begin."
5,Mormon America is worth the time,Mormon America is an excellent resource for non-Mormons and would be valuable for anyone with an open mind who wants to know more about the Mormons. The book was balanced - not the typical venomous anti-Mormon material - and was well-written. It covered all the Mormon issues that you would want to know about.
4,the book is a reliable resource on the Mormon church's activ,"The book is intended to be a high profile, reliable, and objective resource on the Mormon church's activities. It accomplishes this task with more accuracy than any other ""gentile"" authors have to date. Mormon America outlines the statistics, trends, and goals of the church in nearly every major facet, appropriately emphasizing how and why they are unique. It is NOT meant to capture the beauty and breadth of personality, history, and theology that is the church's fabric and backbone. Show me the book that can."
5,Quite Impressive,"This is a great book, it is well researched and totally unbiased. It takes a look at this incredible religion from the perspective of an impartial reporter. It is full of great information about this mysterious American religion.I reccomend it to anyone who is interested in learning about the Mormon Faith. If you want to see the big picture, it's all here."
3,Great for Win95/98 - no drivers for 2k or XP,"I purchased this device some time ago and used it extensively with MS Flight Sim and my laptop running Win98. Once upgraded to Win2k the fun was over. Gravis does not provide drivers for either Win2k or XP for this device. If you are running the older OS, go for it - its a great device. If you are running XP, it will land in the ""computer parts"" box in your garage."
5,"Not a cat person, but liked the book!","These books (the ""Early Step Into Reading"" books ) have been a great confidence boost for my daughter. Yes, they are partially memorized, but she has learned to sound out words. This is the 3rd ""early step"" book for [my daughter], and by far the best, since it's based on more than one basic rhyme. I'm glad I bought the library binding. I know I'll use it for my younger daughter when she learns to read!"
2,Monotany,"This game has great graphics and the scenary, and it is a very creative approach to gaming BUT, it gets old real quick. Once you get the hang of the controls it is simple, you can win any race with hardly any effort. I give it 2 thumbs down."
1,Misery in Manhatan,"I have read all of Austen, including the juvenilia, can watch almost any Austen (or Austen-related) movie or program. I'm also a big fan of Merchant-Ivory films, so I was excited to see this movie, which I'd never heard of. I was bitterly disappointed! This is one of the most self-involved, badly acted, plotless, and pointless pieces of filmmaking I have ever seen. Don't waste your money."
4,Good overview of Narrative Inquiry,"This book's first chapter is difficult to get into, but as one reads on, one learns the many different intricacies of this wonderful creative methodological form. There are many useful examples and very sound advice on creating a narrative work. The book is useful for scholars/authors who are preparing to write a dissertation or book using this form."
3,"Fun, but pointless",Despite the beautiful graphics and multiple characters to choose from (including several from Final Fight) I just can't see any REAL difference between this and the endless other 1-on-1 beat-em-ups out there.I never really mastered all of the special moves but there weren't needed as fighting with simple punches and kicks was good enough. It's fun for a while but in no way a game I would spend ages playing and finishing as every last character. I'm not that sad and I've got better things to do with my time.Graphics ASound BGameplay BLasting Appeal B-
2,Pretty much a let down,"What can I say, I just didn't like this video. I thought Ram Dass had a few good insights about 40 years ago and buying this video was an attempt to revisit that experience. I found nothing of value in this DVD. It was delivered in good condition and on time by the vendor."
1,Garbage,"This game is the biggest load of garbage that I've had the displeasure of playing on the GameCube. The controls are terrible, the car handles like it's glued to the road, the CPU opponent seems to have abilities that make no sense (like moving through other cars and walls), and will often completely disappear! On the plus side, the intro movie is pretty nice, and... that's about it. The music for each level doesn't loop -- after one play, it just stops. The sound effects are just terrible, and the graphics really belong on a last generation console. Crazy Taxi is your best bet if you want a taxi driving game. Burnout and XG3 are amazing racing games. Smashing Drive makes me die inside, a little at a time."
2,"C'mon, this game isnt worth it!","I gave this 2 stars because, this game basically [is bad]. It will probably entertain you for the most of one afternoon. One of the two main problems (and they are big I might add) is the very short game. It consists of 4 levels, (early bird, ect.)and they are all very short. There are some cool things in this game, like using a sonic horn to blow up cars, but the rest of the game is anoyying. You will beat this game in less then an hour. The second thing is the very irritating music. It is a grunge rock kinda song that no one can understand, and it plays over an over again. The worst choice of music in a game ever. I have to say, namco probably did put a lot of work into publishing this program. But at the price, why waste your money. I would have to agree with Gamespot.com, this game will only appeal to true arcade fans."
5,Four times cheaper than the Verizon wireless store,"Works great, came 2 weeks quicker than the Verizon store would get it for an order."
4,Nice deal.,"I bought this film last month for about five dollars less and I just now noticed that they sent me the wrong film. Rather than sending me 600 film I got three packs of 779. So I got an even better deal.The color still isn't as true on the 779, it has a darker saturation giving it this vintage feel. As an avid artist, I do lots of photography work along side painting and drawing. For the artist, this film is very nice if they like color distortion. For every day use, the user may be more satisfied with a 35mm film or digital camera."
1,Old Polaroid Film,"The film I received was old and the quality of the prints was not good. The seller tried to make good on my order even though he had a ""no refund"" policy, he sent me a replacement pack. Much to my dismay, the newer film still had a brown hue to it. I'm telling you, Polaroid film now, is so expensive and to not get good prints, well I'm pretty much done paying all that money and the pictures don't come even come out!!!"
5,Best film !!!,This film is amazing because it works. i was hesitant to buy it but I'm glad I did. Seller is awesome definitely going to buy again.
1,disappointed,I purchased the film for my son's wedding to take a picture of each guest. We opened the film and began taking photos. None of them turned out and it ruined my whole plan. WHen we got home and we talking about the day we loked at the package at the film expired five years ago.
3,Cost a little high?,I'm guessing that the Polaroid film will make a comeback. I used to by this film at CVS for a lot less than $38.95.I'm hoping it does make a comeback even though it was bought out.
2,Too expensive!,"This is such a ripoff for the price. You only get a handful photos for this insane price, which puts this around $1.50 a photograph. And if you experience the problem that I had where the film doesn't work in the camera, you end up wasting your photos trying to get it out. I feel ripped off, here."
1,was guaranteed to work!!,even though the film was expired whwn I purchased it was guaranteed to work.....however it NEVER WORKED INSIDE and the pictures outside were very dark and brown.... Not satisfied for how EXPENSIVE the film was. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!
4,It works!,"Got this as part of a present for a good friend. Didn't realize how hard it was to find Polaroid 600 film these days, but Amazon made it easy enough. The reason I gave it four stars is because the price of these film packs are ridiculously expensive - not just from this Seller, but anywhere currently selling them on the internet.The Seller did advertise that the film packs were technically expired, but provided a guarantee that it will work through a certain date.My friend was ecstatic about the present and said she liked how the older film gave unique exposure effects to each Polaroid. So as far as I am concerned, it is expired, but it works!Seller sent the film promptly and the package was heavily padded. Thanks!"
1,FILM EXPIRED!! DO NOT BUY!!!,"DEFECTIVE PRODUCT!!! I bought the film for my Mom, who loves polaroid cameras. The film expired in 1998!!!! The film comes out this yellowish gold color and NO picture appears. Do not buy!!!!"
5,Deserving of a photon-torpedo salute,"A satisfying (and long-awaited) conclusion to the story of Ael (and Bloodwing)!I recommend you read it while seated, as otherwise you may damage yourself at several points."
5,A wonderful documentary on this martial art,This is a wonderful documentary dvd on Tai Chi Chuan and the related history of China. The delivery time and the price made this a good value for my collection.
5,Perfect for the Preschool Set!,"My 2 year old daughter thinks this book is hilarious! She laughs and giggles at every turn of the page We've read it so much that she's got it memorized - I catch her sitting on the floor ""reading"" it to herself. When I read it to her she loves to answer each and every question with a resounding NO and follows it up with the correct answer.This would be a good book in a group setting - I can just see a whole crowd of toddlers yelling No and cracking up!"
1,ITS NOT FOR SONY HDR FX7!!,"I don't know why they say its made for a SonyHDR FX7, this lens are too small (52mm) and they come with some adaptors (62mm to 52mm) and they look awful in the camcorder, you can see the black rim on the video, I suggest you better find a wide angle lens that fit in a 62mm rim."
4,it's great but,"I would like to contact Astro Pneumatic to see if I can get a 3/16 inch nosepiece, as one did not come with the tool. thank you"
5,Stirring,"Rob Roy, Le Carnaval Romain, Le Corsaire are all powerful and beautifully done. Berlioz should be better known than he is.This is good stuff. Le Carnaval Romain... can't hear it enough."
2,Not a lot of variety and not very challenging,"I just bought this series wanting to have a home workout option when I couldn't make it to my pilates class. I've only taken pilates for 3 months now, but I found the powerhouse and easy pilates videos very underchallening. The easy pilates is for someone who has no experience with pilates and the powerhouse pilates is so easy it's ridiculous. The cardio pilates video is better but the cardio section is SO REPETITIOUS--definitely NOT a video you could do every day. You'll get bored within a week."
1,This bottle is bad for your health,"The bottle performed well, but very much to my dismay I discovered that a bunch of the teflon coating had flaked off inside the bottle and I must have ingested it without noticing. I am particularly dismayed, because when I first bought the bottle and discovered that it had a teflon coating, I called US Zojirushi customer service and I was assured that the coating was safe, that it would not disintegrate due to the heated beverages (black and green teas). This obviously is not the case. For good health, I am now scouring the net for a portable glass-lined thermos bottle - very hard to find. The stainless steel one I had before (with a stainless liner) corroded inside."
2,Not a good video transfer,"Do you remember the 70s when the sight of two lovely ladies trying on clothing would be arousing? This movie is a good example of those erotic, but not explicit, movies. Both women are natural beauties, especially Rebecca Brooke. An effort was made to shoot visually interesting outdoor and interior scenes. The plot is simple. The only reason I gave it a low score is that the video transfer looks like a third generation VHS copy. I don't expect a Criterion-level restoration but for the price, it should be much better than it is."
4,Enjoyable,"Pleasant addition to the series. Good use of known characters. Interesting situations. Ending too tidy and killed off too many characters if he was planning to broaden the series as the ""Star Wars"" crowd has done so well."
1,Worthless,"This book has such great promise, but is, in fact, one of the most useless cook books that I've purchased. I normally give books to friends, the library, or recycle them to other places if I can't use them, but this one is so bad I will probably use it to light the wood stove. The recipes are clearly written, and there are some good tips (the only saving grace) but this is not your Mom's best one dish suppers; most don't even sound tasty.VCJones"
3,"Youthful and cute, but not extremely comfortable","I got this shoe as it is cute and youthful and came at a good price---I believe I paid about 15 dollars for the shoe.I like it aesthetically as it is very different from the other shoes that I have...I actually don't have that many shoes, and I've been trying to acquire shoes that are of varying styles to avoid having a lot of one style of shoe.Functionality-wise, though, this is not as comfortable as I had hoped. The cushioning for the shoe feels like it is minimal---you WILL feel the ground beneath your feet with every step you take. Therefore, if you walk too long with these your feet will not be very happy with you. I haven't had to do so yet, but it seems like the shoe will be easy to clean, however.An ok shoe, but if you're big on demanding well-cushioned comfort this may not fit the bill."
3,Plant Identification Terminology: An Illustrated Glossary,I got this book for an aquatic plants class. To be honest I haven't even opened it really for the class. But the pictures are great! and the descriptions do help if you have not used plant terminology before. I recomend this book if you have never worked with plants. Otherwise you probley could go without the book.
2,Free English Translations Only...,"For the price the quality of the text, the binding and printing, is good. However, buyers should be aware that this edition does not follow pagination of original and does not include the Chinook language or interlineal transcriptions. It only contains the free English translations of the texts."
4,Stars for Christmas!,I got these for my 4 year old who LOVES stars and I can't wait to give her these so she can make her own constellations on her ceiling! They are easily attached and glow real well. (I tested them out! )
4,Electronic Lullabyes,"This group bridges the gap between Bjork's spacey electronica lullabyes, and the Cocteau Twins angelic arias. The background music is densely electronic, liquid and environmental, not unlike Future Sound of London's masterpiece, Lifeforms. The chanteuse alters dreamy, stream-of-conscious spoken word with soaring wordless vocal flights. At times the pieces rise to the loveliness of late-period Cocteaus, but for the most part hovers as intriguing ambient chill-out tunes"
1,Not worth the money,This is full of obvious information that you likely already know anyhow. It was a waste of money and my time reading it.
5,Outstanding review of the barriers in science,"This book is an outstanding review of women in science, the barriers they face and the unique contributions they make. The organization of the text by history, culture, and substance provides the opportunity to look at each of these separately. Schiebinger's documentation and use of contrasting views lends much credibility to her arguments."
4,another fine collection by kooser,"Although I didn't think this collection was quite as good as Delights & Shadows or his Selected Poems, Weather Central is a fine collection of poems. I recommend ""Four Secretaries"", ""In Passing"", ""A Statue of the Unknown Soldier"", and ""Weather Central."" The poems seem to be a bit longer than what he usually writes, though the rest of Kooser's characteristics are here. He still is plainspoken. He is still a simple poet. He's still a poet everyone can love."
5,Good biography for the younger set,"There are a number of Schulz biographies out there aimed at school libraries, mass-produced things with few words, little accuracy, and little interest. This biography, while also aimed at the same target, is a serious work done with original research and interviews and cooperation from Schulz's family. If you have a 10-15 year old who is interested in Peanuts and cartooning, this is a fine book to get them. (Adults may want to steer to the longer but more out-of-date Good Grief by Rheta Grimsley Johnson, or wait for the huge David Michaelis biography coming in 2006.)"
3,Not easy!,This book is definitely for those who are already competent speakers of Italian. In my opinion the explanations of the grammar are difficult to understand. I am very disappointed that the promised CD has not yet arrived!
3,DeCapo Italian textbook / CD,"The book arrived promptly in good condition but without the CD.The seller offered to send a CD should he find one.Overall,I was satisfied with this purchase"
1,A quack who is responsible for my father's death.,"Please save your money and your health. My father died an early and painful death because of Burrough's ""cures and lamplights"". My father's case is the one studied by law students and unfortunately the one that the ""Rose Bird"" Supreme Court used for their personal agenda."
1,A cautionary tale,"The review by the son of the man who died at Burroughs' hand was impressive. It does create one misimpression, that somehow the rule that Chief Justice Bird came up with was somehow aberrational. The idea that only felonies that are inherently dangerous in the abstract was part of CJ Bird's agenda is simply wrong. Almost certainly, that was the rule at common law when United States courts first adopted this doctrine. Further, for those who disagree with judges making law, felony murder two (the doctrine invoked by the prosecutor in Burroughs) is a creation of judges (or at least that most courts have recognized -- in 2009, the state supreme court finally found that the doctrine was somehow part of CA's statutory law. )"
4,Good book.,It is a refreshing read. Has good info/suggestions. Enjoyed going through the book and applying what I could to my life.
1,Leaks! Less than 1 star rating.,"Leaks from coffee reservoir floor after 3 months -- coffee/water actually pours out from underneath machine. No gasket, just molded plastic which means it can't be fixed. Unfortunate as it makes a great cup of coffee. Note that this is a well known problem with this coffeemaker -- just type in any web search engine, hundreds of complaints --- that the company is apparently extremely disinterested in fixing. Customer service is very poor as other reviewers have indicated, warranty/guarantee is worthless."
2,What garbage!!!!!,"OK first of all this movie is crap. The reason why i said this is because it's a comedy!!!! The sound effects are used in the scene where freddy throughs jason, they make a pin ball machine!A crackhead sees a creature with liquid marijuna? One word to the director. like in i love the 80s with that guy with the annoying voice what the f?#$ck!!!!!"
2,Should Not Have Happened,"I went into this movie expecting something awesome and long awaited. I came out of this movie wishing I had never wasted my money or the time on it. The only good thing about this movie is the final showdown. Other then that, the movie had no sense of direction. The characters confused me, because they were new and unheard of. They should have stuck with the ones we're familiar with. All in all, it is a movie that is a complete waste of time! And the filmmakers should think twice before doing a Freddy vs Leatherface of Jason vs Michael Myers. Unless they're just bored and need to make a buck."
4,I've seen it all,"I'm not big on horror,but I've seen them all,Freddy,Jason do they ever die?Thats what makes them so good to watch and this is there best yet.The plot was great how they showed the past of both charactors, so if you forgot anything it was refreshed in your memory, so watch Freddy battle Jason in this gruesome duel to see who comes out on top. A ""heads"" up be ready to see another one ,Enjoy!!!!"
3,pretty cool,This movie is pretty good for a horror flick. Has some cheesy bits but overall it's a good time killer.
1,Terrible,"Like Jason X, this crappy ass movie bites the big one. Why can't people make good horror films anymore? I mean, if some of you knew real horror, you wouldn't even watch this crap. Don't waste your time. This is pathetic."
3,The same thing just a little more modern .,"Good idea to bring Freddy and Jason together, DUMB MOVIE !!!!"
3,it's ok,"I don't think anybody actually expected this movie to be good. Needless to say, i enjoyed it, but be warned, this is not a GOOD movie. The script is poorly written, the characters aren't believable, and even for a horror movie, the situations can become quite ludicrous. Don't worry, there's plenty of gore and naked chicks to satisfy everybody who sees this, and the death sequences and fight between freddy and jason at the end are pretty cool to watch. A good movie to a) laugh at how bad it is and b) watch naked chicks getting killed to some great metal (the movie does boast an awesome soundtrack). Fun, but not good."
2,The Original Is always The Best Nevermind Remakes.,"Freddy Vs. Jason? Why ruin two good franchises?? because Hollywood says SO! To me part 1-5,(with 1 of course being the very best),2 being good,and 5 downright silly.represents the height of the freddy franchise. Wes Craven's New Nightmare was also good, If your like me who grew up on this franchise watching On WBFS-33, or wdzl-39(the most) then NO REMAKE w/o Englund will due."
5,SWEET HORROR FLICK!,"I'LL KEEP THIS SHORT. COOL SPECIAL EFFECTS, ONE SWEET BATTLE BETWEEN TWO HORROR GLADIATORS, PLENTY OF GORE, (AHEM!) NAKED HOT MAMMAS! TAKE A LOOK AT ALL THESE FACTORS AND TELL ME WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE! SEE YOU AT THE MOVIES!"
4,Great film.,"This was a really cool film with a sweet fight at the end. The only problem is that they ignored some things about the chrarctor of Jason. It said in Jason goes to hell that Jason was really a worm demon thing. In this it say's he kill's people because everyone picked on him. Besides that, Freddy vs Jason was one of the best film's of the year. I liked Jason X and New Nightmare better than this. Worth your money."
5,Congrats to Ronny Yu!!!,"I have to say it's the best Horror movie made since Ginger Snaps (2000).This movie has a new story and a awesome new cast, which makes the great. The final battle between Freddy Kruger (Nightmare on Elm Street) and Jason Voorhees is a Raw and Bloody Encounter between the 2 horror legends.Ronny Yu did a fantastic job assembling the cast and crew for this horror classic. Best of it's kind. Go get it!!!"
4,"The clash of the titans, was it worth the wait?","This is the battle horror fans have been waiting for, but was it worth the wait? I'm not a fan of this genre, but this movie pleased me. The story doesn't make perfect sense but its fun, how they meet up is an interesting premise. rather then tossing Freddy into a ring with Jason, the movie gives them roles, Freddy is more of the villan and jason is more of the victim. This brings a different dimension to the film. But sadly this is let down by the rest of the cast who seem directionless. Luckily when Freddy dukes it out with jason, it is the best battle i have seen in a long long while. With wounderful 'moments' to spice up the action, they fight in a furious bloodbath. Whether the remainder of the film works or not this is what the audience came for and it is well worth it. But there are alot of little problems which stop it from being a classic. Since the fight is worth it, i suppose the film is too. I recomend it."
3,End of the road for Freddy???,"Hhhmmm, loved the Elm St movies - even the bad ones. They were scary and innovative and a good time capsule for 80's horror flicks. Didn't think much of this one though. The cgi effects looked fake and to me it was like watching the 'Scary Movie' movies but the punchline never came. Only interesting for Elm St die hards."
4,I still see this movie even though.......,Kane Hodder whom played Jason since Friday The 13th Part 7 isn't playing Jason in this one.But still should be fun too watch.
1,Mindless terror,"You would think that pitting against 2 of the most delightful frightmen known in the history of cinema mano y mano would have in turn created a mega movie yet unseen by man. What we get here is a lot of mindless action in a duel of the monster titans, and although Freddy retains his sarcastic reign, Jason comes across like a broken shell of a man, retaining none of his over power presence. What makes matters worse is the entire cast of onlookers & victims that mindlessly scream into the camera until you want them to shut up. Unlike its predecessors, the cast of young folk here are without charm, and for that matter, without coherence in their babble.The major downfall here is you couldn't care less who survives, which makes the harrowing action around them completely meaninglessness in outcome. Therefore this movie fails at providing any real terror or even concern when putting these undesirables out of their misery could only be a benefit. Absolutely worthless venture."
1,Don't listen to the other viewers!,"I recently saw this movie the other night and it ""was horrible"". It wasn't scary. I mean Jason and Freddy don't even look the same as in the other series they look older. Stick with the first Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street they are best ones not this one it's the worst out of all my friend and I walked out of the theater after five minutes of the movie. It's a waste of money don't see it."
4,Freddy vs Jason Rox!,"This is a really scary movie. I watched it with my cousin in the dark and it was scary as hell. I wouldn't reccomed a little 9-year old seeing it, but I think it is O-K for children who are 12 and over. If you're skeptikal (spell check!) about your children seeing blood and gore, forget it! The sexual content in this movie is very low. There is good action and a lot of scares, so when you get this movie, watch it at night! You'll be too scared to get off the couch!"
5,Gotta Get It !!!,"When this DVD gets released, It will go along perfectly with the Nightmare on Elm Street DVD Box Set & when all you fellow Freddy/Jason fans out there get this DVD, Don't forget to get the DVD of Jason Goes To Hell, cause if you remember at the end of that movie, not only was Jason heading for Hell, a part of Freddy is shown there as well, so therefore Jason Goes To Hell + Nightmare On Elm Street DVD Box Set + Freddy Vs. Jason will be the complete ending story!"
3,Finally! Now is a Death Match!,"If you're a fan of either of this guys, you should defenetly want to see this. The bluray transfer is similar to the dvd quality and the audio was alright. But this is must have in your bluray-scary-collection."
5,I think it should be Freddy Kruger V.S Micheal Myers,I think that freddy should battle micheal myers instead of jason make so much more sense. Jason only comes out 1 every year but micheal and freddy can battle year round. Pluse freddy and jason are both wimps so makes sence thay battle.
2,Freddy vs. Jason - Not good enough,"Freddy vs. Jason felt like an action movie trying to be a horror movie when it should have been a horror movie with elements of action. It's filled with the same old, boring and tired clichés. The story is unoriginal and ""talks down"" to its audience. The computer generated effects are cheap and unrealistic. The cinematography is second-rate. (And, Kade Hodder should have been cast as Jason.) The only good things was Freddy's new face make-up (even though it looked rubbery at times.) Truly a disappointing effort for horror fans."
1,Shoulda been a Super Bowl halftime show,"Okay, first of all, I loved all the old Nightmare on Elm St. movies and Friday the 13th movies. But this movie was a total waste. It's not scary - AT ALL. The story and characters were ridiuculous. Don't waste your time. Even for pure camp value its worthless. What a letdown to what shoulda been a great idea come to life."
3,"Pretty Silly, but Kids Like It","Stupidly violent, but pretty harmless all in all. My 14-year-old enjoyed it, and that was the goal for this Halloween's ""scary movie"" night."
5,The Battle we have all been waiting for,"Ok I had a few people tell me that this movie was not that great, but it was better than I expected. I really liked the beging of the movie where they explain Freddy's birth in detail. The fact that Freddy can control Jason to do his dirty work till he is strong enough to emerge on his own was cool. And the final battle between the two was worth it. The special effects were great and not to mention that the DVD extras were great to. I would recomend this to any Freddy or Jason fan."
5,Wonderful,"What a wonderful book, especially for a dog lover like me. Molly, the sheep-hating border Collie, is such a character and I think Stobie has done a fantastic job of bringing her to life. Miren, the heroine, is delightful, and Nathan, the hero, absolutely delicious. When I was in Scotland last year I had the fortune to attend sheep dog trials and this story brought back many wonderful memories. I'll be looking for more books by this wonderful author and those in the It's a Dog Life series."
4,Not the strongest Letters to Cleo CD...,"I have all the LTC CD's and I am a HUGE FAN. I believe that each CD LTC comes out with the stronger they become. This I believe is the weakest LTC CD, but it is still good. They sound younger and slower. In some of their later work I believe they played well together within the band. This CD is great, but if I had to pick a LTC CD, it Sister wouldn't be my first choice."
5,Had to give it a second listen,"When I first got this cd I listened to it once and that was it for a few years. At first it didnt grab me like the rest of the LTC cd's, but a few years and millions listens later I really like it. I think its as solid as the rest of their stuff. Seems a bit more mature to me."
5,High quality & simple to use,"I actually purchased this product at TJ Maxx for $5, but I would pay a good deal more for it. I've been wanting a tether of some variety for my dog, just to give me a little peace of mind, but haven't seen a lot of products available. I happened to see the only package at the store and took it home to try it. I have a 12 lb Havanese, but I was able to adjust the straps on the size S/M to make them as small as possible and they fit quite nicely. I think the S/M would fit a dog considerably bulkier than mine. I leave this product buckled in the car, and it takes me mere seconds to put on my dog when I go for a drive. The material and craftsmanship seems very consistent, sturdy, and of very good quality. I would spend at least $25 to buy this car harness, but an even lower price makes this a very safe bet :)"
5,Great collection,"This collection is in two parts. The first part is a collection of Irish folktales concerning fairy folk, witchcraft, ghosts, devils, saints, and so forth. It is an important collection for any amateur folklorist. Many of the tales are well told and are sources for other collections (including Kevin Crossley Holland's ""Folktales of the British Isles"") but unlike most anthologies with a wider focus, this contains a very large amount of specifically Irish material.The second component is that of Lady Gregory's retelling of the Ulster Cycle. This too is quite well done, though there have been many translations since (and I personally am fond of the Kinsella translation).I would highly recommend this book."
2,Poorly constructed,"The visual appearance of the toy is great. The range of movement of the head and limbs is also good. However, after playing with it for a few hours, one of the legs came off. The limbs are attached to the body without any pins or connectors. They are rubber-like pieces that are simply fitted into the trunk of the body and able to rotate. However, once the leg came off, it never goes back into place securely. I feel I was ripped off by this product."
3,Not bad,"Findlay Brown seem to be jumping on the bandwagon of young acoustic-guitar toting British singer songwriters - that all sound a bit the same. While there's no doubt he's produced an album that on the face of it sounds attractive and has some catchy songs, it unfortunately lacks that certain something that takes it to another level.He's said that he was aiming for a 1960s sound, and I can't help but compare him to Ben Taylor, who, whether by design or accident, also reminds me of a sixties vibe.Ben Taylor has a knack for making his songs distinctive and interesting that Findlay Brown gets close to but doesn't quite manage. Ben Taylor has a voice you never forget, but Findlay Brown isn't blessed that way; he sings sweetly and in tune, but you never fall in love with his voice. You don't wish you were his friend, you know? He doesn't grab you.And his guitar playing is a bit mundane.But there are a few catchy tunes on the CD and it's not awful by any means. It's just kind of forgettable."
5,Musical journey through the 19th century..kind of,"This melancholic, beautiful album shows how Blanche grew as a band. The lyrics in most , if not all of the songs, are engaging and the music itself is haunting. Too bad they are no longer active."
5,Awsome,"This is the best water conditioner if you have fish , works great , I have used this for a long time and alway get great results ."
2,Started off great but went downhill from there,"This book had a great start - good suspense, good writing. But the further I got, the more predictable it became, and the worse the writing got. I had the ending figured out before I was even close to halfway through the book. And the writing was so forced, with way too many details, and awkward lines like ""He gave her an inquisitive look."" Ms. Barton broke the cardinal writer's rule of 'show, don't tell,' several times over in this book. I don't know if all her books are like this, or if this was the exception, but it'll be awhile before I give her another try."
5,The Diaper Disposer Resolution,"This has been one of the best baby gifts that we received. We've owned it for about 2 months now, and it has been extremely easy to dispose of the diapers and change the bags, even with baby in hand. No tricky buttons or lids. Not only that, the diaper decor holds in all of the diapers odors."
2,Diaper Dekor Blues,"I received the Diaper Dekor Plus as a shower gift. I loved the idea of it. When I opened the box, the doors in the top where broken. I called the company and they did send me out a new insert, but when my daughter was 7 weeks old the doors broke again. So, again I called the company and they again mailed me a new insert. All was well for awhile, till my daughter started on baby foods. Now her room stinks! I change it every day sometimes twice a day but the container still smells. I have started bleaching the container and it does help some, but only for a short period of time. I thought I could deal with it for awhile but now the doors have broken again. My daughter is only 8 months old and I am pregnant agian. So needless to say we will be dealing with diapers for a long time. I plan on buying a different diaper pail."
5,BEST DIAPER PAIL EVER!,"We love the Diaper Dekor. I'd originally picked this out before my son was born, and then changed my mind as it required expensive refill Bags. At first we used the Diaper Champ, as it could use regular 13gal kitchen bags....biggest waste of money ever! it always got jammed with wipes, so you couldn't turn the handle at the top to dispose of the diapers....SO, I WENT AND BOUGHT THE DIAPER DEKOR INSTEAD, AND IT IS SOOOOOO MUCH BETTER! easy to change the bags, lasts longer before needing to be changed, and can even convert to a regular trash can after the baby has outgrown diapers..."
1,Waste of space,"This item is completely unnecessary. I'd heard mom friends mention it and thought it would be a good addition to our nursery. But it's pointless if you live in an apartment since you're probably tossing your trash down a chute every day or so. And turns out that it's equally pointless in a house. No one wants stinky diapers accumulating, but this gizmo is nothing more than a glorified trash can. Save yourself the money and just use a regular garbage can."
5,Not One Complaint,"This diaper pail is great. We've been using it for over 5 months now & couldn't be happier. It's easy to use, easy to refill once you understand how it works (I couldn't believe I really just had to tie a knot at the bottom, I kept expecting individual bags). Most importantly, it keeps odors in check! My son has started solids & his poops now get so stinky that the whole room will smell for a while after a changing but I've left several bad diapers in the pail & haven't had an odor problem yet. And, unlike the diaper genie which some of my friends have, you never have to wonder how this pail works. Just step on the lever. I highly recommend it."
5,Great Gadget,"I asked for and received the Diaper Dekor as a gift after reading other reviews. (My brother had a diaper genie which they would leave outside the house because of the smell, so I didn't even consider it.) We have been using our DD since our child was born, he is now six months old and is beginning to eat solid foods. The addition of solids into our breastfed baby's diet makes for ""much stinkier"" diaper changes. As soon as the diaper is dropped the odor is gone. We love it. I also like the style of the DD and how easy it is to load and unload. I plan to use it in another room after it's no longer needed for diapers."
3,Worked relatively well... until one day it leaked.,"This diaper pail worked relatively well (far from perfect but it definitely got the job done) ... that is, until one day when the diaper bag leaked.Let me tell ya... that is one clean-up job I hope I NEVER have to repeat. The Dekor Plus went into the garbage that day along with everything else from the mess it created..."
1,Malfunctioned,I received this item new but it malfunctioned the first time I tried to use it (i.e. step on the foot pedal to open the lid). I ended up sending it back to the vendor and opted for a different system.
2,Attractive but stinky,"The Dekor is easy to use and attractive, but the design does not keep the stink at bay. Every time I toss a new diaper in, the stink of all the old diaps wafts up BIG TIME."
4,Great Customer Support,"I purchased the Dekor Plus back in Jan of this year. After 7 months, the right spring of the flap failed. I contacted customer support and we received a replacement top in less than a week. The system works great: easy to load and take out. It doesn't totally cut out all the smell but it does a good job. It can hold a large number of diapers too."
5,Best Diaper System EVER,"I have a multi-handicapped daughter in diapers, she is 22 years old. I have owned almost ever type of diaper pail, system in the past 22 years. I bought the Diaper Dekor last year and it is FANTASTIC. If you thing an infants diapers smell, a 22 years olds are 1000 times worse. The diaper pail is in a small bath and since I bought this diaper pail the smell is no longer noticable!!! He brother loves the way this one empties you never smell the diapers when removing the bag. Great product."
2,$22 for a box of refill bags?!,"Give me a break, $22 for plastic bags? Seems to me this company is taking advantage of the fact that once someone has already purchased their product or received it as a gift they have no choice but to buy the expensive refills. In 18 months I've gone through at least 4 boxes, and let me tell you it is painful to put that $22 box in my shopping cart every time. Unfortunately the design is such that you are not able to use any other kind of plastic bag. I've been relatively happy with the product itself (although it definitely does not mask odor, especially as a child gets older... I think some of the more glowing reviews must be from those with newborns!) but due to the expense I now regret putting this product on my registry!"
2,worked for awhile...,"Initially I liked this product, but after about 9 months the hinges rusted and eventually broke off. Now there is no inner lid to keep the smell out and it is stinking up the house. I tried contacting the company for a replacement, but was never able to get a response. Finally broke down and bought a Diaper Genie II to replace the Diaper Dekor. I bought the Dekor originally because of its hands-free use, but now the Genie is also hands-free so hopefully it will work better."
2,Stinky!,"We're disappointed with this product. It's about as unattractive as the other products out there, and it does NOT keep the smell in check. We still have to take the #2's outside to the trash or they will make the whole room stinky, just a little less so than if we used a regular trash can. I am pretty surprised at all the positive reviews.I wish we'd bought the Diaper Genie instead."
1,Baby's Room Reeks,"Having read many favorable reviews, we purchased the Diaper Dekor Plus. Maybe we got a dud, but from day one, it did not trap any odors. Its foot operation was very convenient, but the smell was appalling. Whether open or closed, our Diaper Dekor Plus made the entire nursery reek. We followed all of the instructions, yet, I cannot overemphasize how awful it was at containing smells. Maybe ours was a dud, but I urge you not to spend your hard-earned money on this diaper pail."
2,Glorified Trash Can,"I worked as a Nanny for 11 years before having my own baby. I have seen many diaper pails, and found the Diaper Genie to be the best at controlling odors --but was not fond of the cost of the unit and the constant refills. It is also not the easiest product to use. So I decided to get the Diaper Dekor Plus. It had great reviews and, although the refills are expensive, they were said to go a long way in comparison.The DDP worked well for a while. ...That is until my little pooper started eating solids! When his diapers became more stinky, so did the diaper pail! I had to empty it every day, even if it only had two or three diapers in it! It is just plastic --there is nothing sealing in the odors other than the thin, scented liners it uses. And, even though it has a convenient foot pedal to open the top, you still have to push the diaper through the trap doors with your hand. Yuck!I am now a Diaper Genie fan once again! It is worth the extra hassle and initial expe"
2,Doesn't contain the smell!,"This was great in the beginning, but once my daughter hit about 6 months of age (eating baby food and cereal), the diaper smell could not be contained anymore. When you open the unit to put in a diaper or empty it, the smell is horrible and stays in the room! This is the only diaper pail I have tried, so I don't know if any other systems are better."
1,"Loved It, but Now HATE It","We bought this diaper pail when our son was first born. We loved it! We liked how it looked and how easy it was to use, especially the foot pedal. Didn't like that it cost a bit more and the refills were pretty expensive. But it held in the odors and we loved it! Now that our son is 16 months old, I can't stand this thing! His whole room just stinks! Now matter how I clean it, change it, or add air freshners to it, nothing helps. Everytime we open it to put in another diaper the smell escapes and slaps you in the face. Would not recommend this one to anyone. It worked great till my son started eating everything in sight! I'd recommend the diaper champ now!"
2,Convenient but stinks,"I have to admit that this pail is very convenient, easy to use and empty, but the smell is unbearable. I have 2 air fresheners in my daughters room to help with the stank. Maybe if you empty it every day or every other day it wouldn't be bad, but then why have a diaper pail that holds 40 diapers?"
2,should've kept my diaper champ,"I had the diaper champ for 20 months and then I bought the diaper decor plus. What a huge huge mistake. I gave it 2 stars because it's nicer than the diaper champ and it does look like we can use it after we're done using it for diapers but it's much smaller than I anticipated. I don't know what type of diapers they were counting when they said that this thing can hold as many large diapers as they say it holds. No way. The diaper champ used regular trash bags and therefore it's gotta be much cheaper than this. What a mistake. I got rid of the diaper champ based on the great reviews on this item. Boy am I sorry!UPDATE: 1/06I still miss the old diaper pail, however, I've found a very inexpensive way to use this item. I use regular kitchen sized draw-string garbage bags. At least it saves me the money on buying the refills."
1,Go back to Diaper Genie,"I heard great reviews about this product. I loved it at first. It was great that I didn't have to bend down to do any twisting. After about a month of opening and shutting the lid, it started to smell really bad. My son (13 months old) is the typical curious toddler. He constantly opened and shut the lid (there is no lock like the Diaper Genie). I always found toys, pacifiers, etc. in the bag when I had to dump it. So I had to tear the bag open to retrieve these items. The smell is the worst. I can smell it walking down the hall. I went back and purchased the Diaper Genie."
1,Not what any mother needs,"I purchased the Diaper Dekor Plus back in September based on reviews and good pricing (online at Target for only $29.99), unfortunately this pail did not live up to expectations. Once arrived I used the pail for all sorts of diaper disasters (#1 and #2) and immediately I noticed the horrible smell that wafted from the Diaper Dekor Plus. Resigned, I began using only for #1 diapers, hoping this would cut down on the smell. However, this was not the case. I don't even have to be in the same room as the diaper pail to smell the pungent odor. I've finally given up on the Diaper Dekor system and hope that after a month outside, empty, I might be able to use this thing as a stupidly expensive trash can for office trash."
2,smells after awhile,"beware, as your child ages, this system does not hide the odors. We have twins thus, two bins and the rooms that the bins are in STINK! I am replacing them."
2,Can't Contain Odor,The Dekor system is much more user-friendly than the Diaper Genie - which we used before - but it cannot contain the odor. We love the foot-pedal action but will be going back to the Genie because of the smell. Wish we had read some of the previous reviews.
1,There are better alternatives,I found the diaper dekor to be easy to use but it did not contain odor the way it claims. I had to remove the diapers every day and spray the entire thing with lysol just to decrease the odor. The refills do last a long time but to keep the odor down you do have remove the diapers often. I eventually threw it away and got a diaper champ which I love.
1,Diaper Dekor Disposal System is a Joke,"After all the on-line reviews I read, I thought for sure this was the diaper disposal system for me. After just two days of use, the stench of urine in my daughter's nursery was awful. I immediately boxed the item and returned it to the store where it was purchased. This system doesn't even deserve one star..."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be.,"I thought this thing would be ""the bomb,"" and it was -- but in a bad way. The smell of my 16 month old's poopy diapers is not well contained, the foot pedal doesn't open the lid very far when it sits on a carpeted floor, and my daughter loves to open the lid and stuff her toys, shoes and anything else down in there when I'm not looking. I wouldn't care about the expense, if I was happy with it's performance -- but I wouldn't recommend it to others."
2,Surprised by other reviews - had odor problem,"I was surprised when I read the other reviews of the Diaper Dekor. I bought this after being unsatisfied with the Diaper Genie and although it is easy to use, it did not contain the odor at all. Even after 1 day of diapers, I found it hard to walk into my 11 month old son's room because the smell was so bad. After returning this, I bought the Safety 1st diaper disposal system which contains the smell completely, but it does require 2 hands to use."
4,Great Product!,"The Diaper Dekor system naybe on of the best purchases. None of my friends had heard of it and insisted on the Diaper Genie, but I am glad that I stood my ground! I agree that there are still some odors, but I think that there will always be. I just put a ""stick-up"" deodorizer in the lid and everything is good. The best part is that the refills seem to last FOREVER! My son is 5 months old and I am still on my 1st refill. The refills seem expensive, but not when they last THIS long. And being able to tear off an old bag and tie up a new in seconds, excellent. The last thing that I love so much is that it can also be used as a trash can, so I do not have to have an additional trash basket in the nursery. I would actually give this system 4 1/2 stars if I could!"
5,Works Great,"We have had the Diaper Dekor for 22 months now and are very happy with it. The step on, one hand functionality is terrific. It keeps the odors in and is easy to use and keep clean. The front door is pretty easy to open. We simply try not to draw attention when we change the bags to diminish her curiosity. We have not any problems with her trying to get into it. When our daughter reached 18 months or so, we decided not to put dirty diapers in the Diaper Dekor. Instead we put them in a plastic grocery bag and simply take them directly to the trash outside (there are far fewer now than when she was smaller). We found we were able to use plain white kitchen garbage bags in the Diaper Dekor and they worked fine. We are expecting our second child and will be purchasing another Diaper Dekor. I would suggest using the recommended liners unless you decide not to put the dirty diapers in after your child gets older."
3,Okay Product,I put this on my registry after reading all of the 'excellent' reviews. I got it as a gift at my shower and love it but hate it. It is GREAT for keeping the oder 'locked-in' but bad at how it functions. My pedal (to open with) didn't work from day one and the door on it doesn't lock right. The refills don't last as long as some of these other reviewers said (guess it depends on how many diapers your little one goes through). Within the first month and half I needed a new refill. I didn't have any refills so I just use a kitchen garbage bag (works just as well and is a whole lot cheaper). It is a pain to get the bag out when you don't use the refills cause you have to pull it out from the bottom. I rate it three stars cause it does lock in odors and the concept is good - the rest of it just isn't all that GREAT.
1,"A ""Waste"" of Money!!!!!!!!!!!!!","We bought this diaper pail when our newest baby arrived. We had previously used a Diaper Genie, that we no longer had - it worked fine, but was expensive. We decided to buy the Diaper Dekor because of the Odor Free Guarantee. Don't buy it. The guarantee or the pail!It stinks up the whole house with just one or two diapers in it. We have kept it in the garage, and also outside. Not convenient. Refills are expensive. And worse yet - my one year old can get DIRTY DIAPERS out of it through the top - or get the bag through the door in the front!!! Who designed this thing????"
1,Stinker Dekor,"I bought this item after reading sucn good reviews. It worked fine until my now one year old daughter started eating solids. I used to have the pail next to the changing table in her room but couldn't bare the smell anymore so now it's stationed in our second bathroom. Six months ago I would have given this item a better review but if it can't handle extra load of food, it's not worth getting a good review. Now I'm hunting for a new diaper pail. What a waste of money this was."
4,Move over Diaper Genie & Diaper Champ........,"The Diaper Dekor is great. I had the Diaper Genie for my first child and hated it. All the twisting made me crazy. It didn't hold nearly as much as the Diaper Dekor. Also, the smell does not escape when you open the lid as did with the Genie.My only complaint with the Diaper Dekor is that the petal does not lift the lid very easily. I am not sure if it is because I have it on carpet, but the lid seems too heavy for the petal to lift. It's not that big of a deal, I just lift the lid up with my hand rather than using the petal."
1,Easy To Use But Not On Smell,"I bought this product because of the reviews I saw here. While the Diaper Dekor is very easy to use, my experience found that it does not keep the smell contained very well at all! The diaper genie does a much better job with containing the smell and I can get the refill for the genie at most convenient stores near me. I'm very disappointed with this product."
2,Can't Contain the Stink!,"I have 4 kids 5 and under and this is my third diaper disposal system. I switched from the Diaper Genie two because I thought the refills would be a little cheaper and with two in diapers, I'm all about cheap. After 3 months of trying to pretend it was working, I'm going to have to end this relationship. It just stinks, folks. Even with an air freshener in the container, my whole bathroom and room smells like dirty diapers. I am smelling them in my sleep. I cannot figure out how this pail is any different than a regular trashcan with a foot petal. Bottom line is, it's not. The Diaper Genie contained the smell AND I was able to shove in way more diapers. I'm sad I wasted my money on this. And I hate admitting I'm wrong. But this product is goin' in the garage sale!"
1,Stinky.,"The Diaper Dekor Plus stinks, literally and figuratively. I had a friend who liked it so I bought one w/o reading reviews... bad move. Well, I still haven't read the reviews, but I am writing this one. IT will be short - this diaper stink containment system DOES NOT WORK. After a few days, the babies room smells like a dirty diaper. The refill does not indicate when it is nearing the end, so when it does, you open the Dekor and all the diapers are falling all over, not nicely contained in a bag, like they should be, ready to be tied off. This product looks great in theory, but in my experience, doesn't work."
1,Yuk my house smells like dirty diapers,"I am so disappointed in this product, I will admit it's easy to use by using the foot pedal to open the top; but my house smells like dirty diapers!! I had the same Diaper Genie for 4 years and with the birth of the most recent babies thought it was time for a fresh diaper pale. I saw the convenient design of the Diaper Dekor and purchased 2, what a mistake. The bags are not scented and it is no way near air tight so it makes the room/house smell like soiled diapers. Might as well use a trash can."
3,Wordy,"This was a nice looking book, but I bought it for my grandmother, expecting it to be more of a tour/guide book. It's more like a history book, and not really what I was looking for so I returned it. It's not the kind of book you'd be able to look at while on the road (like say have the navigator point things out - too wordy for that). It does have some really nice photos though. Also, when I received the book the cover was a little worn, even though it was supposed to be new, so another reason I didn't want to give it as a gift."
5,Pelican Pete,"It's a wonderful book! I really enjoy reading this book to my son. He loves to look at the pictures.. It's an easy, enjoyable story."
1,Let's just say...,"...in all fair WARNING to those of you out there who might be tempted by the accompanying reviews here to purchase this recording of Prokofiev & Rachmaninov 3rd Piano Concerti, I read some of these reviews and was astounded at the praise. BEFORE ANYBODY BUYS THIS, please purchase Byron Janis' superb recording of the Prokofiev 3rd with Kiril Kondrashin conducting the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra. It is one of the greatest recordings of ANYTHING, EVER made. There are, also, many wonderful recordings available of the Rachmaninov 3rd. MANY... Buy one of those first."
2,too tight,It took a few holes of golf but I could not continue wearing this visor. Had to switch to sun glsses.
3,hmmm...,"Well, I love the idea of these, but so far they are not working out so great. One of the bags ripped, and the other did not hold it's seal, so it's basically an overpriced garmet bag....will give it one more try..."
4,It s ok,The product is good. I ve hanged 4 winter jackets and work fine.Be carefully with the ranger - they can damage the plastic bag.I ve opened and closed 2 times without problem.Let s see how long does it take to desinflate
3,Not A Great Recording...,"Another live Steeplechase release from the prime of Dexter Gordon's career in 1965, should be a slam dunk - right? Well, it might have been, but this live session is not as well recorded as one would have hoped. Additionally, the piano Kenny Drew is playing is ever so slightly out of tune. Dexter is flanked by Drew on piano, Neils Henning Orsted Pedersen on bass and Alex Riel on the drums.To my ears, Dexter and the group don't sound as on top of things as they normally do, but of course there are some nice moments such as Dexter's playing on the ballad: ""I Should Care"" and a solid performance of ""Take The A Train."""
2,Diaper Dekor is only so-so,"I bought this for my first baby and at first it was great. When the diapers are not that stinky, the dekor is a good diaper pail. When you start to give your baby food and the diapers begin to smell, then the dekor starts to smell. You could walk into her room and it was awful. (and yes, I would change the dekor often) Which was another issue - having to purchase their refills got to be pretty pricey. We just had our second daughter 2 months ago and we had to get a different one - we could not even wash the smell out of the diaper dekor - we threw it in the trash. :o("
4,So far so good,So far our new Diaper Dekor has done the job. It is easy to use and the bag refills are simple. It has only been a month or so sice we started using it but it has been a huge difference in the smell factor of the nursery.
1,This book is not very detailed or complete.,This text is incomplete. It can best be characterized as an overview. The length is very short and the shallow nature of the content makes it not very useful for design work. It has truncated materials properties tables and one paragraph descriptions of the various issues packge designers are faced with.
5,Lyrical Virtuoso,"I happened to read ""Musical American Directory 2004"" online. There, Mr. Harris Goldsmith who is a long time critic and a faculty member of Mannes College of Art in NYC, writes, ""Li's debut CD of works by Chopin, recorded by Deutsche Grammophon immediately after his triumph, is imperiously rhetorical, bringing out important bass lines resoundingly. But his second recording for DG-a Liszt recital that includes perhaps the finest account of the B-minor Sonata I have ever heard-is, if anything, light years ahead in patrician elegance: exquisite artistry from one of the greatest talents to surface in years-nay, decades.""My curiosity was aroused and rushed to get this Liszt CD. Viola. I have since been totally immersing myself in Yundi Li's virtuosity and his many emotional climaxes. Compared his playing with several other masters, like van Cliburn, Horowitz, et al, I've found that Li has more of romantic impulse. Absolutely fantastic."
5,We all need to read this,"This is an incredibly detailed account of the Nuremberg trials: the men on trial, the behind-the-scenes drama, the haunting, damning evidence presented. It boggles the mind to think that a trial of such immense scope requiring the cooperation of four Allied countries could have been planned and carried out within a matter of months after the conclusion of World War II. Yet it was, and the world learned conclusively of the horrors of the Nazi regime.The profiles of the accused Nazis were incredibly gripping. In the end some appeared to have been sadistic monsters, while others were simply weak toadies. We will never know precisely why so many people went along with so much evil, but knowing what happened may prevent a reoccurrence.This is a well-written, fascinating book."
5,The book is a very detailed account of the trial.,"Persico with great detail and careful analysis gives us an insight to the trial that will forever change the way the world looks at international law. I think that he put great effort into his book and clearly without bias showed the tribulations of the""Imfamous"" trial."
3,If only the author had stuck to the facts...,"There are no doubts that the book is well written and entertaining, and that it takes the reader through the Nuremberg Trial in a way which makes it difficult to put the book down. However, I've read this book after having read Hitler's biography by Ian Kershaw, and I found it difficult to read a history book written as a novel. I have enjoyed more the 'scientific' approach of Ann & John Tusa in their ""The Nuremberg Trial""."
1,Very Disappointing,"For $60 and based on some of the higher rated reviews, I thought that this DVD would provide me with enough information to implement with my son. I was also led to believe from reading the reviews that there would be examples that would use the methodology while viewing a parent/child interaction. This 2 hour DVD was very painful to sit through. The presenters were very monotone and dry and repeated the same things over and over again. It was hard to follow any example all the way through b/c each one of them felt the need to interject with side notes and thier opionions. In the end, my husband and I didn't walk away with any additional ideas/tools to parent our child."
3,Try The Art of Bloomsbury first,"This is a nice book. Very informative, but I would recommend ""The Art of Bloomsbury"" over this one. Both books have a lot of the same images, but The Art of Bloomsbury images were larger, more clear and richer in quality. Not a bad book at all, but just not the best one out there."
2,dissecting mahler,"Listening to Pierre Boulez conduct a Mahler symphony is like being present at an autopsy. Yes, every orchestral detail is vividly revealed. Yes, every orchestral texture is immaculately transparent. Yes, the tonal balance is breathtakingly maintained. Yes, the Vienna Philharmonic plays with remarkable sensitivity and finesse. You hear things that you never heard before. But the fact remains that the autopsy is being performed on a corpse. Each symphony is dead and Boulez is just examining, classifying, and cataloging ""the remains."" I have listened to all nine Mahler symphonies conducted by Boulez and I always come to the same conclusion. The music is dead and Boulez is just determining the cause of death."
3,Great Carolan resource,"First, a warning. If you are a Linux user, plan on borrowing a Windoze box or a Mac for the downloading. The downloader for this sucks in a major way. For Linux, you must download each of the 213 tunes one-at-a-time. Only the Win or Mac box can download the whole batch. Don't know why they can't provide a single, say, Zipped, file for Linux user. Did I mention that their downloader is a piece of crap?The music is a good reference piece. It's rendered on a piano (maybe a MIDI piano) with chords of Sheridan's choosing, bearing in mind that the original scores of Carolan's works have melody only and no chords or other harmonies. So take Sheridan's chords with a grain of salt. They are not gospel. For those who learn by ear better than the printed page, this is an excellent resource. An excellent companion to this is the book, _Carolan - The Life, Times and Music of an Irish Harper_ by Donal O'Sullivan."
3,An Average Tasting Curry Powder,"I was a huge fan of the Cross and Blackwell brand of curry powder, having eating it since I was a child 55 years ago, and have been searching all over for a close replacement ever since it was taken off the market. Needless to say, I was quite excited when I read the positive reviews that I read on the Madras brand and quickly placed my order.After receiving it, we tried it twice with our favorite chicken curry recipe and I am sorry to say that it did not come even close to the flavor of Cross and Blackwell. To us, the Madras is an average tasting off-the-shelf prepared curry power; it tasted bland and the aroma was just okay. The first time I used 3 tablespoons in about a cup of liquid. In the second try I doubled it to six tablespoons and it still came out tasting bland.BTW - When I say it tasted bland I was refering to the powder's flavor; not heat (it is not a spicey curry)."
5,Get this book to see Don Heck's amazing art.,"Don Heck, the artist of Iron Man gave the series a lot of class. While unfairly given bad reviews by the fan press Don was a drama and romance comics artist first. He wasn't a super hero artist in the Kirby method. He gave Tony a distinctive character and till this day I think of his version as the true version of Iron Man. Until Marvel makes the CD ROM version of the first issues of Iron Man available in color; this is an affordable collection of the first and best issues. I always did like his original costume best!"
1,"Raw, uncorrected OCR text","Beware! This is raw, uncorrected OCR text. A vaguely apologetic note on the copyright page--in very tiny print--asks readers' forgiveness for ""spelling mistakes, missing or extraneous characters"" and actually has the nerve to suggest that if in doubt, readers should consult the original scanned book.This book represents a new low in publishing standards. Although the publisher--General Books, LLC--feebly attempts to justify it in the name of ""low price,"" $20 for a 107-page cheaply-bound book cannot be considered ""low."" This travesty would be unusable at any price. A very fine PDF facsimile edition is available free on Google; you can print it yourself for far less than $20."
2,Dry as can be,"If I knew that this kind of reading was in store, I would not have returned to school. Can't someone make this topic exciting to read about? Not these authors. Maybe no one can make nursing theory exciting. Maybe there is a reason."
1,Junk for junkies. How about that?,"Ah yes, more mindless, God-awful drivel for low-lives to pop pills to. Honestly, have you ever HEARD any of this stuff? Terrible, terrible, terrible.The fact they have cartoon drawings of Star Wars goes some way to explain the faceless unoriginality of it all. Music without a soul or purpose, programmed by coke-snorters and listened to by ecstasy popping drones.The Curmudgeon is not a snob, but, really though - I am BETTER than the people that listen to this music. End of story. Stay on the right side of evolution and avoid at all costs."
5,Deserves five stars,I would suggest this book anyone dealing with STL. It provides extensive best practice input for the experienced C++/STL developer.
1,Do Not Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i bought this last winter because of all the snow incase i drove off the road, i am telling you this thing is so cheap it wont get you out of a ditch any time soon, very cheep materals used i reccomend not gitting this, get a better snow shovel"
5,"Great pianist,great teacher,great DVD","Andy Laverne is an experienced musician and teacher.He knows that it's very important to a student to play well arranged examples in standard formats and reharmonized versions to compare and feel those new ways to expand arranging skills.It's better than study static theories and rules.Great instructional DVD for any musician,no matter the instrument he plays.That's important to say that the beautiful and amazing reharmonizations are very sophisticated and a pleasure to listen to.Highly recommended."
3,ehh... it's okay,I bought this book in hopes of finding out more about a genre of film I love intensely. But alas I started read on some of my favorite films and discovered glaring errors and omissions in the synopsis of some of the films. The interviews and profiles are alright and the films that were rounded up is fine. But the details are what ruin this book for me. I don't feel a need to return it but knowing what I know now I wouldn't have bought it in the first place.
1,Poor quality,"This is a beautiful watch. It's huge, it looks classy. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and unfortunately have had nothing but problems with it. The first one that I bought the second hand fell of in 2 days so I bought a replacement. I have had the replacement for about 2 months and the second hand has fallen off again. Great looking watch but apparently poor in quality."
4,Tanita scale,Tons of features & works great. I just wish it was as easy to use as the Tanita I bought 12 years ago. You cannot simply activate the scale with your foot. You have to scroll through memory buttons and then set the scale using two buttons that cannot be pressed with your toe. Its just a minor inconvenience though. As I mentioned the accuracy and features are much improved from the older model I just got rid of.
3,Expected more,"This wasn't one of Alison Weir's better books. The facts and events of Henry VIII's life were a little disorganized, not very detailed, and a bit dry."
3,Fact or Fiction?,"I am only giving this book three stars because I liked other books by Ms. Weir. I read The Lady Elizabeth and Lady Jane and loved them both. I, personally, like the way she uses historical fact to create a fictional story. She brings the great historical figures to life in such novels. On the flip side, I found this particular book to be dry. It was a big change for me to read the other two books, which were fictional accounts based on fact, and then read this book. If I didn't know my tastes, I would say that maybe biographies aren't for me. That isn't the case because I have read other historical biographies. This book was bland. I look forward to buying The Queen Elizabeth in February, but I will not be buying another one of her biographies."
5,Good...but not amazing.,"Strike Witches was an entertaining/fun anime, but I can't really say more than that. The animation was good and there was never a point in the anime where you could see a budget drop. The story was also slightly lacking and it seemed a little rushed. The one thing I can say was that all of the characters were extremely likable. Even thought there wasn't much character development I still ended up loving the characters. Sooo... all in all I would recommend this to someone but I doubt it will make it on anyone's list of favorites."
2,Quite expensive for cheap material,"These are cute, but they fade very quickly because the material is so thin. I already had the valance and that was so nice that I thought these would be the same quality. They are not. I never would have bought them if I had seen the quality first. They are much too expensive for the poor quality.My advice is the buy the valance (topper) and then plain colored drapes that are a thicker, better-quality material."
5,Opens the door to a new world!,"Great book. I normally don't read books of this nature, but was pleasantly surprised with this one. Wayne Teasdale gives the reader concepts that can be applied to give their heart and mind a sense of peace, at the same time making the world around them a better place."
4,Excellent product,This product is effective and sent free. One problem I have had is the roller ball 'locking up'. I have found if I squeeze the edge where bottle meets the ball the ball will be able to move freely again.
3,Dennis Miller - All In,"While Miller had a prophetic comment about Hillary and her election efforts two years in the future, the original Miller attraction has been missing for some time now. He used to make such arcane references that when you got them you felt 'smart' as well as in on an insider joke. His humor now is still entertaining but you don't have to think to follow it. The odd insertion of an offbeat reference just titillates those of us who enjoyed Miller back when..."
4,Highly recommended.,Excellent. Attention bankers: Keep this book in your corporate library. Goes beyond loan syndications and is a great source of information for other professionals in banking.
4,Chipeyye Diaries,Ths was cute. My granddaughters loved it. Ages 5 and 3. We got the 3 chipette dolls which they love. ait was a birthdaypresent for my 3 year old who's name is Eleanor.
1,NOT STEEL TOE,"THIS PRODUCT WAS LISTED UNDER OPTIONS, BUT WAS NOT STEEL TOE. THIS IS WHY I AM GIVING IT A BAD REVIEW. I HAD TO GET A APPROVAL TO RETURN IT, THE MONEY WOULD NOT BE REFUNDED FOR 2-3 WEEKS. SINCE IT WAS SUCH A HASSLE AND THE COST TO RETURN..."
2,Not Impressed,"The book does offer some good information but that particular information is so basic and just plain common sense it wasn't much help.The biggest problem I have with the book is how ""dated"" the information is. It makes it difficult to conceptualize the actual scenario being described. On the authors behalf he admits that the book is dated in the foreword.With all that said, because there is a lack of any other books on the subject (that I have been able to find) this book is worth getting."
4,Definitely worth reading!,This is the kind of book that stays with you long after you read it. I'd recommend it for any teen or adult with an interest in reading about adventures most of us will never experience. A very heart-warming story!
5,Good well balanced fan at a good price.,Got it on sale with free shipping. Great price. Delivery was almost instant. Running on low it is very effective and quiet. Use it to mix up the air in a room with tall ceiling. Eliminated the vertical temperature gradients and made the room comfortable. Does much better than a normal ceiling fan.
5,A Place for Zero,This is a fantastic book for teaching place value to young students (grades 2-6). The mathematical vocabulary carries for this grade span. The interest level will hit across the grades as well. My students liked it so well someone took it home and I had to buy a second copy!
4,"Go see these guys live, and feel the vibe.","To really appreciate the Grumby-ness, go see them live at one of their (usually weekly) shows in NYC. Bring a candle, light it, get up dance, spin yourself around, and then pour the molten wax all over yourself. This seriously enhances the live experience. And you can usually get a funny word from Schwartzer if you really get crazy and inventive with your waxing. Enjoy."
3,Video on Demand VS. box set,"so haven't yet finished watching season 2. I really enjoyed season 1, and have been looking forward to it. this review is more about the poor business practices of fox. delaying the release for so long, and the pricing... I can watch instantly for 21.00 a season, or buy the box set for 44.00. seems like a no brainer to me, and just idiotic for them to have such a pricing disparity."
5,COOL!,My classmate's Dad wrote this book. We live in Hawaii and he brought this book to show everyone. I thought this was cool!
4,Bluetooth Adaptor,"This product was a good buy, instalation was a breeze. Configuration wise, the only problem I could find is that when you try to bluetooth your contacts you have to do it one by one. The other thing is that when I bought it, it did no specify the contents of the box, and I bought a mic and it already came with the adaptor, so I have an extra mic. Other then that excelent."
3,Pioneer Bluetooth Adapter,i paired this unit with a Pioneer AVIC-D3 NAV HEAD UNIT. My cell phone carrier is Verizon. Once a cell phone is paired it then must be registered in order to maintain the pairing. Could not get the phonebook download to work with my phone. Overall unit works good with direct dial or stored numbers or when answering incoming calls. Not as smooth as factory installed voice recognition units in newer cars.
5,Pioneer CD-BTB200 Bluetooth Wireless Adapter,"Awesome little addition to the Pioneer head units. Though, the BT Audio seems to skip and/or pause a lot. Not sure if it's my iPhone 3G or the Pioneer Wireless Adapter though. Overall I'm satisfied. Phone call quality is absolutely excellent. Functionality and user friendliness are also definitely up to par. I think a system like this is a definite rival to Fords SYNC."
3,I can't get it to work,"I have had this for about a month. It is easy to install, but I can't get it to work with my phone. My phone will find the device, but for some reason will not pair. So I spent $130 for something pretty useless to me at this point. If I can get it to work I am sure it would be an awesome product."
3,between ok and not acceptable,"Not a lot of options, very simple, not impressed at all. def.. not worth the money. It does basic functions only."
2,Stopped working after 7 months,"Unit stopped working after 7 months, My Car was in storage for 5 of them months and Pioneer said there is only a 6 month warranty for the problem I am having. Waste of 100.00 down the drain, thought it would at least have a year warranty. While it lasted unit was nice. Seller was excellent on shipping it prompt."
1,It did not work at all :(,First of all it did not work as expected.I did waste $50 in installing this stupid device. Blutooth connection was successful. but i was not able to hear anything in case of incoming calls though the person is able to hear me.it does not show the number fully in the screens.Better avoid it..
5,Excellent technical reference,"I really like this book. The internals of the CIFS protocol is not a subject for the faint hearted, but Chris has really tackled it well. This is just the right book for people like me who want to understand what is going on on their network at the bits and bytes level.In the Samba Team we have been working on implementing the protocols that Chris describes in this book for the last 12 years or so, but we've always been doing this from sniffer traces and incomplete specifications. It was quite an interesting experience to see all this information distilled into such a readable format.This isn't the sort of book that one buys grandma for Christmas, but if you run a Windows network and have been curious about what is happening inside all those network packets, how your computers find each other and what that weird error message really means then do yourself a favor and have a read.Andrew TridgellSamba Team"
1,misleading title,This product wasn't in any way what I thought it should be...the title was misleading
4,A must have for all fight fans,"The fighting in Contour is truly amazing. Real contact and blazingly fast choreography. What it lacks in story it more than makes up for in fights. The movie is almost nonstop fighting, and all of the fights are so good it's really hard to choose a favorite. If you are a fan of fight choreography and have not seen this, you need to get it today. No excuses.4/5Special features on the Indican DVD are plentiful. There's a 30 minute making of, blooper reel, deleted scene, Tae Pho instructional video, practice videos for the movie, a stunt demo and trailers."
1,SHAME ON WARNER BROTHERS!,"Shame on Warner Brothers for calling this collection a COMEDY Collection. And the other reviewers - where's your candor? Yes, Philadelphia Story is a classic comedy. But DINNER AT EIGHT, which has a few (a very few) funny moments, is, in fact a very dark story involving suicide, hateful marriages and people at the end of their means; with no particular redeeming quality. STAGE DOOR, it had funny moments, yes, but always with a very sad, dark suicide looming. TO BE OR NOT, this is like a skit, a joke, being stretched out to an hour and a half. LIBELED LADY was funny, but hardly a CLASSIC. BRINGING UP BABY is screwball comedy, but we all know that this was NEVER considered a CLASSIC. My recommendation (now that I feel bad I spent so much based on the other reviewers) - buy the films you know individually. One at a time. PHILADELPHIA STORY is a MUST HAVE.Then you can laugh at the rest of us for buying movies we'll never watch."
5,Dragons are best kept on a short leash. This shows how.,"Hi,I read this as I was going through therapy. Together I was able to sort out my ways of reacting to people and how they got setup. He believes you can only have one of them, but I think I had three. I have different histories to explain each, but now I have them under control. If only there was a book that would help me sort out my Dyslexia this easy. (Sorry for the spelling errors.)Good read. (If you know anything about Dyslexia it's hard for me to read at all, but this was worth it.)BB"
4,Very good and well researched,This is the most accessible and available of the few ogham (or ogam) books out there. It is luckily very good and well researched. Working through this book will put you on the path of mastery of this tool. It includes in depth interpretations and a number of useful spreads.
5,Nicer than it looks!,"This is much prettier than it appears in the photograph. It has a dark purplish blue background with a rich teal patina effect. It's big, it's happy, and it greets all of my guests at the front door with a smile."
4,Good enough,"Excellent fit, no problems with size and for the price is good enough.I will buy a fancier next time."
2,Good idea but mediocre performance,"Caps do not stay on well, even with the sealant. Needs a stronger adhesive to keep the caps on."
1,alright gun,"this gun is nice if your just shooting at targets ten feet away from you, but if you want to actually play against people you will get owned, forshure. this gun is also very fragile and it already broke in half, so i would suggest spending a little more money and getting a better gun, it is well worth it if you want to play competitavly and dont want to get dominated."
1,IT SUCKS NUTS!!!!,"This gun sucks nuts. I had it and i never shot anyone with it. Also, it is immposible to assemble and aim. It breaks the second day you get it too. Dont get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Loaded Remote That Is Simple Yet Powerful,"I read so many negative reviews from this remote, I was very skeptical of buying it at first. Thankfully, I was so very tempted by the remote's affordability, and I decided to buy it anyway. I haven't regretted that decision I made around a month ago. It is EXTREMELY easy to program, contrary to what all the otehr reviewers are saying, and the instructions are simple and straight-forward. Basically, if you follow the steps, you can do it. The only negatives I have about this remote is that it is a bit bulky, and it is not very ergonomic. The LCD buttons are sometimes a pain, but this as far as it goes in terms of complaints. It is the most affordable all-in-one remote (that also has an LCD screen) out on the market. I strongly recommend it."
1,Worthless,"Doesn't have basic functions for preprogrammed devices. For instance there is no ""Open/Close"" for DVD. No eject function for VCR. No ""Guide"" or ""List"" function for the Cox HD PVR. You would think as I did that no problem I will just program the in with the ""Learn"" function. No way. I have used several programmable remotes through the years with no problem but after 6 hours playing with this one I have yet to program one function.I think they should have payed me to take it."
3,Not real thrilling,"Philip Kerr's latest involves Americas deadliest assassin Tom Jefferson. Jefferson is hired by the mob to kill Castro. After accepting money for the job, he happens across a secret recording of JFK having a go at his wife (who happens to work on JFK's campaign). This causes Jefferson to change targets. Due to his failure to follow through with the Castro assassination, the Mob now targets him.The novel takes place in 1960 and '61 and has been researched real well. From the songs that were popular to the talk shows and movies (Psycho). The novel lacks suspense. We know no assassination takes place in '60 or '61. It also lacks a protagonist to cheer for. Most characters in the novel are crooked and corrupt. The reading was dry.Philip Kerr's previous novels 'Esau' and 'A five year plan' were, in my opinion, much better books. As a thriller writer, I feel Philip Kerr has slipped a notch with this latest effort.Recommendation...Library"
4,Another great book from Philip Kerr!,"It was my second Philip Kerr's book, and it was so good as the first one. He style, remember a mix of Michael Chrichton, with James Elroy. The story is great. Brings a new view, about Jonh Kennedy's death. This is a fantastic book. Every thriller's fan should read it."
3,Kind of disturbing in an untalented way,I can't really give it a rating so to be fair - here's the median grade. The book is about Japanese soldiers in Burma as a marching band providing musical relief from the rigors of combat. I guess in 1968 or at least in the 1968 of Japan (this is a translation) no one clued into the lack of irony here.
3,Taken: Abduction of SciFi by a Soap Opera,"As can be expected by something produced by Steven Spielberg, this mini-series has good actors and high production values. The scripts and direction are fine, but nothing outstanding.Essentially, this is soap opera mixed with Spielberg suburban feel-good morality using the alien angle and government cover-up as a pure plot vehicle and nothing more. As with most Spielberg works, it is long on production values and short on depth or profundity.It does keep your viewing attention, but only in the ""what will happen next to him/her"" sense of soap operas. By all means, sit back and enjoy, but don't expect much of substance from this series. I suggest watching it first before considering a purchase. Probably a safe buy for those who loved The Waltons or Little House on the Prairie."
2,It had potential...,"At the start, this ten-part miniseries showed promise especially with the Spielberg name attached to the title. Unfortunately it wasn't long before promise faded leaving behind about 13 hours (without commercials) of boredom which offered nothing new in terms of storylines or ideas regarding the `alien abduction' theme.Perhaps ""Stephen Spielberg Presents Taken"" wouldn't have been so dull had it been reduced to 7.5 hours (or less) instead of the final 14.75 hour product. It seems as though the miniseries was flushed out to fit the original two-week scheduled run and to make room for all of the commercial advertisement spots.Throughout the two-week run I was optimistic that the story would get better and that the pace would increase. When the credits began rolling at the end of part 10, I realized that I had been mistaken. I also realized that I had wasted 20 hours of my young life on this miniseries. In short, I had been taken."
5,"Taken, The Series","An excelent production, very interesting. I saw this series on tv but a lot of chapters and scenes have forgotten. When I watched it again was hard to believe realize that really I missed a lot of essential parts. I reconmmend this article."
3,Dissappointed,I was pretty disappointed - These works don't live up to the Name Brand writer - Expected alot more for a writer of this caliber.
5,Riveting,I loved the series when it first came out. Now i watch it again with my wife. She wants to watch the whole box set in one night.
4,AMERICANA,"OF HUMAN HEARTS was Jimmy Stewart's first major piece of Americana, his first serious foray into the nature of the American spirit. This story of frontier life in a village on the banks of the Ohio River in the pre-Civil War era was a pet project of director Clarence Brown. A whopping prize of $5,000 was awarded to a high school student in North Carolina named Ray Harris - he gave the film its title which was based on BENEFITS FORGOT authored by Honore Morrow and published 20 years previously. Although there are definite cornball elements in the film, and its somewhat too slowly paced, the film stands up as a good evocation of the period in which it takes place. Huston gives a remarkable performance as the zealous preacher and Bondi is great as his gentle soul of a wife. The film was beneficial to Stewart's career; it was his first crack at a fully developed charactisation - and its success made it obvious that he was an actor with a definite future."
1,not happy,"I am not happy with the range of courseness. This grinder does not give a course grind to pepper. It is all to fine. If you are looking for course ground pepper, this is not the mill for you."
3,nice pump,"I don't use the pump everyday, but when i do use it it's great.. very quiet.. what i don't like is the awkwardness of the stand the two pumps go on is hard to adjust.. also i don't like how if both aren't being used, the suction is not strong. so i've got to use both everytime i pump..."
1,Don't buy this pump,"I regret buying this pump. I would highly recommend only buying a Medela pump. As a working mom, I rely on this pump for daily pumping several times of day and this pump cannot handle it. I've been using it for less than 7 months now and I've had two horns break and thought the pump was broken since it kept dying out. After speaking with Evenflo support and getting a replacement pump, I realized it's just a defect in the pump. I now see lots of reviewers complaining of this issue. With my first child I used a previously used Medela pump that was handed down to me after my sister-in-law used it for her 3 kids. I didn't have any problems and I pumped for 10 months. Working mom's don't need to deal with the additional stress of a pump not working properly."
4,Time for a little nostalgia,"If you yearn for a simpler time, when a community was more centered around the life of the local church, you will probably really enjoy this series about small town life in Mitford. The first book is primarily designed to get you involved in the main characters, and as such I felt it started very slowly. But hang in there, a mystery develops, there is a wonderful inspirational salvation experience, oh and of course a love story begins to unfold later as well. Enjoy!"
5,Wonderful therapy!,"These were the first books that I was able to read after the death of my father. I feel as if I were guided to them somehow. They have a peaceful, healing quality."
1,Never received items.,"Have never received items from this seller, even after trying to contact by email. Lost my money. Buyers beware!!!"
3,Brought back memories,"I bought this for my 4 year old grandson who is quite the little reader. I enjoyed the memories of Dick and Jane more than he enjoyed reading the book. (No cars, no interest for him) Maybe my 3 year old granddaughter will soon learn to read and enjoy it more. I do recommend the book, but if you're buying it for yourself because of nostalgia, you might want to consider buying the hard back version."
5,Great Product at a Great Price!,Joyce Chen Bambo Wood Oil has assisted in keeping my wok and all the accessories looking new and in great condition!Thanks
4,Seemed to Work,Bought this to use with Totally Bamboo 3-Piece Bamboo Cutting Board Set. Seemed to do the job. My cutting boards have endured alot and still work great. The 8 ounces last a long time.
1,Unusable due to strong oder of filters themselves,"I had high expectations for these filters, but they are absolutely unusable because they fill the room with a noxious fake-vanilla odor. In contrast to the statements in the owners manual (which claims the odor will only last a short while), this odor remained very strong for over a month of continuous use on the highest fan speed. Eventually, BlueAir sent me a replacement set of filters because the first set I had were supposedly defective. The odor from the set of replacement filters was even worse. All subsequent attempts to contact BlueAir customer service regarding this issue have gone unanswered.I have no idea if these filters are at all effective in removing odors because they have introduced a much stronger, equally offensive smell into the room where the filter is. If you have a room that you'd like to reek of fake vanilla, buy this product, or perhaps just a $5 Glade plug-in."
2,Overdramatized and not much helpful information,"This documentary was something on par with the crappy History Channel ""documentaries"" of religious material. It is over-dramatized and contains very little information that is helpful. Producers spent most of their money on the crappy actors and special effects. There was even a portion of the movie talking about the Holocaust because, well, that deals with Jews and so does the Gospel of Judas. REALLY? There was nothing in this documentary that couldn't be learned in a quick read through Wikipedia. It would save an hour and a half."
4,FAIRLY TRUE TO THE NOVEL,A bleak setting with a depressing tale which is exactly how it was supposed to be if you read the novel. Small roles by Charlize Theron and Robert Duvall. As the father struggles to get his son to the southern coast (where it will be safer) they come across a number of conflicts and we see that the father has lost a great deal of his humanity which is balanced (at times) by his son. I was going to give this picture a lower rating until I realized that it's supposed to be a downer. It kept me engaged enough for a couple of hours and I had originally planned to watch this one over three of four days. Fairly true to the novel which I read last year. After seeing this movie you might be grateful for the life that you have even if there are problems in it. WHEN WATCHED: 10/01/2010; MY GRADE: B plus (C plus to B minus if you don't get this is supposed to be a downer tale).
3,Bleak?,When I read the book I couldn't wait to see the movie.It is good but I was disappointed that it was not as bleak as the book described -there was more color and less inclement weather than the book.Where was the ash?I was also disappointed that the boat scene was so short and the boat so different from the novel which described a pleasure craft.Viggo was very good. The boy was too whiny and too healthy for having been through what his 'papa' had been through too.Will
2,"Dark, literally.","This movie is literally dark. It is filmed in such low light it might as well be a radio show. The screen is sometimes completely black for minutes at a time. I can't speak for other viewers but squinting at shadows for two hours gives me a headache. As for the story, I didn't find a lot here. It's relentlessly bleak and simple. Perhaps if I'd been able to see it I would have appreciated it more. As it is, I can't recommend it."
3,"Really like this movie..,took the characters behaviors personally","Where I agree with some of the previous summaries in general.., I became irritated by the father & son's inability to work coherently in regards to survival issues.., The son was to young to declare policy while being told matters of survival..."
1,One of the Worse Movies Ever,"Boring, a real stinker; and so much so that I won't spend any more time to say more."
1,Complete Waste of Time,"Being a fan of post-apocalypic genre, I would have bought the DVD, even if I had known how bad it is. Anyway, that's $16.00 and a hour fifty one minutes, down the drain. Too many screenplay, story line glitches, and nonsensical scene scenarios. The basic story line about the man's relationship with his son was intact. But, the rest of the film was ""out of sync"" with reality, given the conditions portrayed in the film. (Now, tell me you didn't think, the black guy would appear at the end.)I'm sure Guy Pierce and Robert Duvall got paid, for their five minutes each in the film."
2,Viggo Mortensen Wasted,"I think the idea here was to turn Cormac McCarthy's novel into a film which was more similar to ROAD WARRIOR, however with more literary value and somberness. Somber they got down. This is so somber that I had trouble sitting still. I was getting bored. The pacing was off too. I really like Viggo Mortensen and I am thinking of the many splendid movies he has made. My favorite of his was HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. There sure was nothing somber or leadenly paced about that film!So this is a film about a man and his son who keep living and trudging about in a post apocalyptic world even though they don't have a moment's enjoyment in the lives they are living. The father teaches the son how to commit suicide. They come across some suicides in a barn. They also come across a band of marauders.Viggo Mortensen can't save this film and that is saying a lot. This idea was done much better decades ago. In addition to ROAD WARRIOR, I would also recommend Jane Alexander in TESTAMENT."
5,Incredibly Realistic,"The movie is good. There are few characters, but the acting is near flawless. The story is great and the concept is just plain realistic. This scenario could possibly happen and I can honestly say that I could easily envision a planet like the one depicted in the movie.The movie is depressing and haunting because it is so realistic and it represents a possible future reality.From what I have heard from people not liking it, the reasons they don't like it are because it doesn't explain the cause of the new, wasteland conditions of the planet, and because it's so real.Seriously? That doesn't make a movie bad. It makes a movie different . . . . and GOOD."
2,The Road: Starring The Color Gray,"I didn't enjoy this movie. It seemed like something I would like, but negative emotions are all I can use to describe it.Here is a quick summary of things I remember about this movie:1. The color Gray - The entire movie is in various shades of gray and while I understand it's the end of the world, no hope, etc., etc., It gets old.2. The whiny kid - In a post-apocalyptic world, you would think that a father would figure a way to harden his kid to prepare him for survival in this cruel, post-apocalyptic world.3. People eating people - Cannibals were such a crutch in this movie. Whenever things got tense, the answer ultimately was ""cannibals""...4. For a movie called ""The Road"", it didn't really go anywhere - I understand that the point of this movie was to be depressing and hopeless, etc. My problem with it is that you can accomplish that feeling in a vehicle that is still entertaining.In conclusion, I found this movie mostly tedious and annoying."
3,Gloomy doomy greyed out movie,"Charlize Theron had the right ideal when she checked out early.I thought she was crazy, but obviously she had seen the movie.Kind of like dealing with work every day, then having an earthquake hit ...Double yech with grime all over!!:("
1,Pointless and nihilistic,"Hands down one of the worst post-apocalyptic movies I have ever seen. The enemies are as shallow and mindless as zombies, the main character spends all of his time wondering if he should kill his own son and then himself. Rather than self-reflective, the main character comes across as self-punishing and cowardly.Ignore this one. Go forThe Book of Eli."
4,LONESOME ROAD,This well-crafted movie is a very dismal and sad look at a futuristic world ashen and gray with little hope of anything better. Viggo Mortensen is superb as the driven father and Cody McPherson (sp) is heartbreaking as the son. Charlize Theron's brief role as the mother scores well too. Adding to the doom is we don't even know what brought on the apocalyptic event. Certainly a downer but quite well done.
1,Is the movie over yet?????,"This movie is apocalyptic.......and makes you wish you were there, at the end of the world with no electricity so you wouldn't be stuck watching this move which goes on like a blister in the sun."
4,The Road,"The Road was a very good movie about a man and his son struggling to survive the appocalypse. It is a very dark movie, but well written and keeps you glued to the screen. My whole family enjoyed it very much."
4,Gritty and honest.,"Gritty and honest. Not unlike the book. It did cautiously veer from the more disturbing scenes in the book, but probaby had to, to be allowed to run or be rated at all.It was depressing and sobering. It imagined a similar world I myself imagined while reading the novel by Cormack McCarthy. The difference is in the telling. McCarthy's words were beautiful in describing the world around his characters for all it's horrors. The movie could only offer visuals and hope that they did the authors verse justice.As true to the book as the movie appeared, I knew it couldn't offer me the experience of living the words.Good job, but in the end, the book was a better experience."
2,Too Ernest but Lack of Substance for a Film,"I am certain that ""The Road"" was a great or significant book.To make that book into film, the makers faced a challenge:There's no story!Another problem is the film makers took themselves too seriously(you too Viggo).The film gave the viewer a sense of self-importance."
5,"It's depressing, be warned!","Not your typical ""end of the world"" bravado flick. I believe it to be a more accurate as to the ""would-be"" state of humanity after an apocalyptic event. Just don't watch it if you are already depressed. This is a bleak movie. I did however enjoy and I do recommend it."
2,Mad Max meets The Kid....,"It was probably wrong of me, but I was giggling a lot during this adventure!That said, I should point out that I also thought this film was no joke.What I actually thought was this: what a waste of time, why don't I justturn it off and water the tomatoes instead, or clean out the litter tray?I'm sure other good folk who saw this oddity can claim to some sort of pointto all this (please don't respond - I'm really not interested) but it reallyescaped my attention.After the 17th father-son kiss and hug I couldn't take anymore save for one final and futileattempt to decipher Mortenson's words. I think they went something like this:""mumble, grumble, mumble, mumble, protect you, mumble, love, mumble and mumble.""It would have been a brilliant vehicle for Chaplin - as a silent movie of course.One star for the effects and one star for the unintended comedy.Oh, and the kid was terrible."
5,Saved me money!,"This was a great investment that helped me get the best quality at the lowest price. Thanks to this book, I was more knowledgeable than most carpet salesmen. They'll tell you anything to make a sell. Be armed with the best information before you make a large purchase such as carpet."
1,Perhaps better information elsewhere?,"I did not like this book because: It was too short. It was only 60 pages. 60 pages of paper stapled in the center. The information could be helpful to some If they had never read anything anywhere else ever about carpeting. I didn't feel like this ""book"" was worth the money. I think there might be more informative resources at a more economical value for the carpet buying consumer."
1,dreams from the sunny side of the street,Amazon says this tape is remastered but I got one that says mono and it sounds like it. The pied pipers sound like the chipmumks. I paid 15.61 for a tape that is awful and I cannot return it because I opened it and played a couple of tracks. The liner notes say tall order mastering what ever that is. But it seems to have made my tape really bad. Others have given this a great review so they must have received a better tape then I did.
1,_ _ _ _Gel Dispencer,"Pros: Great idea. Easy to use. Easy for travel.Inexpensive.Cons: Does Not Get Hot.Got tired of putting cold lather on my face in the morning (especially in the winter). Thought this would solve that problem. Instructions warn of steam escaping from the unit. Instructions say it heats up in minutes. It gets to it's maximum temp in 12 seconds. It heats up to just above room temp. I thought I bought a bad unit, so I had it exchanged. Same result with new unit.If you are looking for a Hot lather shave, then I suggest you pay for a more expensive product."
5,"UNIVERSAL : NO OTHER MACHINE EXISTS , YET","There is no other machine out there that fits my shaving creme. I was happy to get this.Maybe one day we can have the best of all worlds : our favorite shave creme and a hot lather?This one felt cool and different until a month later when I realized it was a nuisance and ineffective.If you buy one, you can always resell it on this site if you reach the same conclusion."
2,A luke warm reception to this gift,"Received this item for Christmas and was looking forward to anexciting experience on the 26th. It was not to be.I measured the temperature of the gel with a digital thermometeras it exited the ""Hot Gel Machine"";94.5 degrees F on average, and that's on the highest setting.Luke warm would be a generous description. I didn't bothermeasuring any lower settings.I thought it would be warmer than skin temperature!"
