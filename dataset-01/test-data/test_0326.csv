2,not as pictured!,"I got these bags for a holiday craft. They are nice and a very good price, but beware they are not as pictured. they have a large purple decal on the side of it... which is not as the picture shows. They would be perfect other than that... the picture really needs to be updated I would not had wasted my time and money if it had been accurate!"
2,Not all clear!,"I ordered these to use as party bags for Valentines. I needed clear decorating bags to put cocoa in for Valentines bags. Cute idea and they would have been great if there wasn't a big purple ""Wilson"" label on the bag. It did not make cute Valentines bags for my childs class and is not shown in the picture. I didn't have time to find more so i had to use them. Probably great decorating bags if thats what you need them for but just FYI there not all clear. It comes with 2 purple labels on them"
4,Baking,"This product is a great value for the money spent. Easy to use, especially since I am a novice to cake and cookie decorating. Again a great buy."
2,doesn't come with decoriting tip,"picture is misleading as it is showen with decoriting tip, but package contains only plastic bags.really annoying to find out taht tip is missing when teh cake is ready and you need to find somewhere to buy the tip"
4,Excellent,"This book so far has been excellent. The beginning chapter is easy and the first few tricks will get some ooohs and awwws. Take your time and read and practice. Do not be scared to make mistakes. And, like the book says, never repeat a trick. Try to develop a routine, even if it is just two to three tricks. Lastly, never, ever reveal how your sleight is done. mikeh."
5,"Amazing, amazing book to begin and grow interest in magic","This book is simply perfect. Each chapter corresponds to a specific technique and concludes with complete ""tricks"" that employ that technique. The chapters generally build on each other, but you can jump around to some extent. The book's many illustrations make the difficult aspects of the tricks transparent.This book, plus the willingness to practice card conjuring in private and then actually perform the tricks for friends and families will get you there! I ran one trick 4 or 5 times for one of my colleagues the other day; her only response: ""Oh, I get it, it's a trick deck right? They're all the same card, right?"" Nope. When I turned over all the cards (revealing a genuine deck) her jaw simply dropped....."
2,Try the DVD's....,"If this is the best book to learn card tricks then don't try to learn card tricks from a book! You won't get past chapter 1 of this book without letting out a loud, frustrating, ""What are they talking about."" There is a DVD series based on the book. I would seriously recommend you go that route and actually see what they are trying to tell you to do. The book just doesn't get it done."
4,Interesting look into an equal marrage,"The Bems tried an equal marriage that no one had tried before them. They had no role models, no guide books, only their unconventionally gendered past to lead them into finding a marriage that could suit them both. The idea of equal marriage is an old one these days, but it was a scandal only thirty years ago. The subsequent description of their feminist child raising is a look at how difficult it is not to bring gender stereotypes into the home. The results of this genderless child raising is unique insight into how much freer people become when they are outside the constraints of gender. This autobiography is very enjoyable account of a one of a kind life. I recommend it for anyone curious about other forms of marriage/child raising."
4,Reviews on the back of the book.,""" Gilfoyle has tied together into one package the interrelationship between the role and status of women, American ideas about sex, the effects of urbanization and immigration, real estate speculation, vigilantism, and politics....In short, he has effectively brought issues of sexualit int osocial history.... Deserving of the highest praise.""----------Vern L. Bullough, HIstorian"
4,Reviews on the back of the book .,""" A wonderful book . The reasearch is overwhelming in breadth, precision, and imaginatoin. City of Eros beautifully portays an aspect of social and urban, as well as economic, history, which we can on longer ignore.""--------Mary P. Ryan, University of California, Berkeley."
3,Rickety crunchy country,"3 1/2For those who take their alt-country with extra alt, Califone provided a reasonable diversion towards Wilco's increasing monopoly, but the urge to dress and edge up with production clatter can sometimes undermine an otherwise thoughtfully composed work."
3,Not all Diana and not her very best,"The title of my review says it... she doesn't sing all the songs and she's not at her best in this CD. If you want a CD in which she sings with others, you're better off with the ""Christmas in Vienna"" CD."
3,nice but kids don't use,"The torpedos were a hit, but these are not as popular with them, they barely if ever use them at all"
1,terrible...never received,"Never receieved anything even after contacting dealer twice. The charge went through immediately though. Ordered 3/13...Told 2nd shipment would go out early April. . Guess not that time either...Bad, bad, bad deal."
3,sudden impact dvd has better picture than the blu-ray,"I find it funny when people say the picture looks great just because it's a blu-ray. I have both the dvd and blu-ray for sudden impact . I noticed the blu-ray has purple halos around peoples faces in certain scenes. When i checked the dvd , the same problem did not exist. I find the dvd to be more realistic to the intended look, even with the lower resolution. I threw away the blu-ray and kept the dvd."
1,So disapointed!!!,"I bought this coz I am a dog lover...I have had 3 great friendships that have changed my life with three different Labs... I bought this dogumentary expecting to see part of the relation that i have had with my dogs...ummm...not at all...its so very cheasy and at the end of it all the dog is nice and she needs help.If you love dogs and you can see deep in their eyes, dont waist your money on this movie."
3,"Nice, but why bother?","The mouse may be wireless, but you still have to plug in a base, which is fine if you have a pc, but is not mobile enough for a laptop. If you are sitting in a chair and the base for the mouse (base is attached to computer by cord of course) is sitting out of your way on a side table, then mouse won't work. For the base to be close enough for the mouse to work, then the base and its cord are in the way, defeating the purpose of wanting a wireless mouse. I prefer a true wiress mouse, with no cords leaving the side of my computer."
5,Rare Music,"I had this record as a child and I loved it then, so when I saw that it was redone on a CD, I just knew that I had to buy it. There are songs written by Brian Wilson, Jan Berry and these songs you don't hear. I am very happy with my purchase.Cathy Ignatowski"
2,Pornographic book,"I'm not a prude when it comes to literature but I found the illustrations offensive for a child's book. The illustrations of the cat and Grandpa both depict human genitalia. In case you think that this is just my misinterpretation of the drawings, I polled multiple adults without telling them about the pictures and they all had the same conclusion. My 5 year old daughter did not like the modern Peter and we couldn't understand why the duck has such a ridiculous upper bill. The classic version of the story is better.I enjoyed the accompanying music and narration- it is creative and not overdone. I would recommend purchasing the music CD separately."
4,Earth Wind and Fire,Very good CD and easy listening. Enjoyed it mainly because you can't go wrong wtih an EWF CD....
4,very enjoyable,"I would have given this a 5 star rating except that I find the tempo to be to fast in places, and the gun shot in the rat battle is way to loud. This is the first music only version of the Nutcracker that I have listened to so I can not compare it to other versions, but it is very easy to envision the ballet while listening. I like to play this when I have a long car trip, it is about 1 and a half hours and the melodies are so beautiful that I find myself singing along and this keep me very alert - but, if you listen to these CDs in while driving and have the sound turned up, watch out for the loud gun shot."
2,I AGREE WITH rivercircus REVIEW ENTIRELY,"Rivercircus' review was well written and I agree wholeheartedly with every word written there. I also agree with the two star rating. ""The Story of Esther Costello"" is boring and trite and I have nothing more to add. Read rivercircus' review for the excellent run down on this mediocre film."
2,Doesn't stop odor,"I heard some good things about this stuff, and like that it doesn't have any Aluminum Chlorohydrate, so I gave it a try. It just doesn't work at all at stopping odor. I have average body odor, applied as directed to my underarms, daily, and used it for several weeks. By just after mid-day, I could tell it wasn't preventing odor. I was as smelly as if I hadn't put on any deodorant. Good idea behind it, but it didn't work at all. I'm just going to throw it away."
3,the book is fascinating if you're 16,"I like the beginning part of the book as it describe the life of the boy but as the story began to proceed, the story became too predictable and the plot seemed to be like from the Harry Potter's series. I like the description of the rainforest and that eventhough I'm only 18, I think the book is not as fascinating as I thought and the target audience should be younger."
3,Superhero kids,"Isabel Allende is one of my favorite authors and I was interested to read what she had written for young adults. I was disappointed to find Allende did not carry her usual writing skills to this book. The language was too simple. Even in this age of superheroes, I found the feats of Alex and Kate unbelievable and the adults to be totally helpless and irresponsible. Young adult books tend to give the kids the power but this was over the top.I did enjoy being immersed however in the wonder and mystery of the Amazon and found the ability of the People of the Mist to disappear interesting since the Aborigines in ""Mutunt Message Down Under"" also are well versed in becoming invisible. Allende is always a master at making the reader feel they are in the setting, seeing and hearing the sights and sounds. The positive reviews I've seen seem to be by young adults, but they should know this book is by no means the best of Isabel Allende."
3,Not up to Allende's standards,"Okay, even the great writers have lapses so Allende should be forgiven for this one. It reads as if she threw it together to appeal to all the Harry Potter fans and I mentally cast the actors from Smallville as the main characters.There are great descriptions of people and places in the Amazon backwaters and anyone willing to plow through the endless plot will learn how the native peoples suffer horrific exploitation.But the dialog is so stilted it makes you wonder if Allende or her intrepid translator hired out the writing/translating to interns. And the Grandmother character is so unlikely, even though we're expected to admire her unconventional ways, she annoys the reader whenever she shows up on the page.Too bad--I love so much of what Allende writes."
4,Interesting viewpoint but needs comparisons,"This was the first work by Chomsky that I have read and I found the opening few chapters quite interesting. It is definitely an eye opener on the behaviour of the Israelis, the US support and the regular cover ups that took place. The cynicism is refreshing, however starts to wear thin around the half way mark. The overly sarcastic tone detracts from the quality of the facts that are presented and it begs further reading to establish comparisons.The fact remains that the figures that are expressed when it comes to the bloodshed are astounding. This is definitely a book that warrants a look to see inside a world of activities that have not been fully exposed in the western press."
3,Kept me reading and guessing despite a few technical flaws.,"The characters interacted well and were quite believable. I couldn't help drawing comparisons with the Jon-Benet Ramsey case, but I was surprised at who the killer turned out to be. I am usually good at guessing so I can't help wondering if the author gave enough clues (even subtle ones). I was also quite disconcerted throughout with the constant shift in tense and point of view."
3,A pleasant enough read,"This is the first J.F. Freedman book I've read. It is, in summary, a pleasant enough read, but nothing fantastic. The courtroom scenes are not what we've come to expect from top-notch writers, and the plot becomes unnecessarily involved. Still, though, if you are a fan of legal fiction it is a satisfying novel."
2,TOO BAD ABOUT SECOND DISK,I bought Frazzetta: Painting with Fire a few months a go. The second disc was awful. The extra features were not that great. It was not worth $25. Now it comes out with Fire and Ice for free. I feel cheated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Three-Quarters of a Great Movie,"For three quarters of the way, Return To Paradise is an engrossing fable of a man's search for meaning in a world which seems to have spun out of control. Until Gary Cooper returns to the island and reunites with his 16 year-old daughter, this film is a warm and moving interracial love story. While the last 20 minutes don't sink the film, they undercut what could have been a genuine classic. Still very worth watching, especially on a cold, snowy night in January! Luscious photography, filmed entirely in the South Pacific. And it goes without saying, Cooper is aces."
2,Purchased for Mom as she is a big Gordon Lightfoot fan,"The packaged arrived a little torn and there were some lines in part of the movie which is common in a VHS tape. I purchased it for my Mother as she is a Big Gordon Lightfoot fan and he was not a main character, and had a very small part, disappointing. She still enjoyed it and I was very pleased that it arrived in a timely manner."
4,Maupassant's Diary,"""Afloat"" does not resemble anything else written by Maupassant. It is a true story (as indicated at the end) and is based on his personal travel. It has some amusing descriptions of the French Reviera and Monaco, but also contains some grim philosophical thoughts that explain some things about Maupassant, not the least of which is why he ended up in a mental hospital."
5,Surrender to Jonathan!,"My first exposure to Jonathan was hearing the catchy track ""New England"". I immediately wanted to listen to more Jonathan, and bought this album. By not taking himself too seriously Jonathan manages to make some profound statements. It is full of honesty, compassion, and straightforward fun that make Jonathan one of the most amusing and yet touching artists in the world. As another of his albums suggests, don't analyze Jonathan, Surrender to Jonathan! And oh yeah, see him live."
5,Obscure classic,"I found this album in the deletes bin at my campus record store in 1983 or 1984. I had heard of Jonathan Richman, but pre-internet (!), had never actually heard him. So I shelled out the $2.99, or whatever, and got took it home. I still listen to it, having long worn out the vinyl, lost the cassette, and now listening to a digital version. The songs sort of creep into your consciousness, find a home, and live there happily for decades.I remember a review that said that Jonathan Richman was at his worst when he was childish, but at his best when he was child-like. This may be his most child-like album. Enjoy!"
4,Very good,"A book without a mystery, but with much action. If you like other Agatha Christie novels, this might not be for you, as it is more like an action ""lara croft"" game, rather than an adventure book.Those that like things changing constantly will love it.Recommended as one of the best."
3,Worth the money,"I wasn't expecting to much for the price. The system isn't too bad, sound quality is ok and looks good.Long cables help position rear speakers.Over all, good value for money."
1,Should be retitled: Castrating Books.,"It's just wrong. If you want to create art - make your original work. There is no way you can justify defacing, damaging, and plagarizing other people's work.Palimpsest - the practice of reusing parchment and vellum by scraping off original work, was a necessary process, as material was not readily available. Too often, those who alter books justify the act by referring to this necessary practice, and it is ridiculous to do so.Learn about books and how to make them. Make them from scratch. A book is not your canvas no matter the condition."
4,Nice Popular Science Overview of Waves,"Nice Book. Definitely a good read. Does not go deep into mathematics of the waves or coriolis forces, but yet is lucid to understand and get an idea of the soup of elements at work to produce surfable waves. I am an engineer and could appreciate more math had it been there but I do not regret its absence. There are plenty of reference mentioned at the end which can be followed up for more curiosity.Must have for the scientifically inclined surfers."
3,Mixed up,"Owning clean versions of both the opening and ending tracks to this show are pretty much reason alone for this, but the inclusion of rap doesn't really make any sense at all. It actually sorta feels like they needed something to fill the CD up so they just filled it with their current playlist."
5,GOES HAND IN HAND WITH THE FILM'S GREATNESS.,"I never owned the original soundtrack on vinyl, so I'll take the word of the other reviewers who rave about the enhanced quality and production values on this CD. The tracks are well produced and I easily recall them with the appropriate scenes from the celluloid classic. That's the acid test with any movie music. And Bond obviously had no need for earmuffs with these sounds."
2,Broke me out!!,"I'll say the pro's first. It covered nicely, went on smooth and helped with my splotchy makeup.However, so much for being ""acne"" friendly!The next morning I broke out in random pimples and couldn't figure out what could have caused it.Then I researched the ingredients and silicone is known to clog pores.If you don't have acne prone skin this would be great for you. It's dumb that it is specified for acne prone skin though.Also it is only 1 oz which is really nothing."
3,Kindle Version,"Interesting overview of these five ladies. Not brilliantly written (or edited, for that matter) but made me want to look for more indepth solo books about each of them.BIG COMPLAINT and nothing to do with the book, per se, but as often occurs, the Kindle edition had NO pictures. I kept thinking ""must be at the end"" because I really wanted a view of what these ladies looked like, but didn't get it. I presume the print issue did have illustrations, as some of the other reviewers have commented on it.Again, want to know why Kindle's readers are being neglected this way."
3,"good product, but buyer beware!","This is a great product from a quality name brand, but beware as you only get the table. If you want the stopper and measuring tape, you have to pay extra. The image on both the Amazon site and the Biesemeyer site, shows the stopper. While I understand that all details may not be available on amazon, the Biesemeyer site does not indicate that these items are extra either. I researched before buying and expected to receive the stopper and tape with the purchase. Beisemeyer was less than helpful. Be careful when purchasing as the stopper and tape will cost you another $100+, (if you shop around for the best price). It gets three stars only because the table itself is a quality product."
1,Style over Substance,I am afraid that Mr. Sugarmann's logic does not add up. He has a lot of emotional arguments which are not supported by the facts. This book says that the gun industry is unregulated. In fact it is the most heavily regulated industry. Josh Sugarmann knows this because he mentions the ATF and NFA. It also says that gun sales are both going up and going down.
5,"Ahh, the taste of good cheese...","Wow! They just don't make movies like this anymore... in a garage that is. So if you take the production value saavy eye out of the equation, you'll realize these things are FUNNY! Some great gags in both flicks to be sure..."
4,FORGET THE SAXOPHONE,"For those of you looking for adult contemporary jazz, this album is what you need. Over a beautiful instrumental background is not a sax, not a guitar, but a voice. Yes, Randy's voice is an instrument and that is not something you can say of everyone. The best tracks here are ""Can we bring it back"", a gorgeous love song that should be (but is not) played on evening love song shows; ""In my life"", featuring demanding lyrics and vocals that leave you with such a sense of freedom you'll be playing it over and over again. If you've ever liked Chaka Khan and wished she did more adult contemp., you will be satisfied with this album. The final track(title track) will have you wishing it wasn't over.... Like many other lost treasures, I found this cassette in a bargain/clearance bin....why? i'll never understand. Gourmet belongs in the gourmet section and this album is worth a lot. Get it into your heart!!!!"
4,Good reading,"I encountered Bill Miner first in the wonderful film ""the Grey Fox"", which still is not available on DVD. I picked up this book some years later and was floored when I found out that Miner was born about 30 miles from me in Clinton, Mich. Miner's story is interesting and much of what was in the film actually happened. The part that the authors lost me on was their claim that Miner was a homosexual preying on younger men. I did not see any evidence of this in their material and feel it was purely specualtion on their part. As another reviewer pointed out, maybe it was to try to sell mpre copies. nit O dpm't see how that would habe helped."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Wonderful opera, beautiful performances, HIDEOUS recording. I can't make out anything at all. Save your money for one of the newer recordings unless you have an extremely good sound system."
2,Rushed to print?,"I've read all of Bourdain's other books and had a special liking for his ""culinary gangster"" stories. This novella reads like a first draft or outline for a similar story. It needs filling out. I was disappointed and felt that it was rushed through editing in order to capitolize on the author's current popularity. Sorry Tony."
5,Great book but sad story,"Well written and documented by Mr. Lapinski. This book exposes the unfortunate truth about Timothy Treadwell. He had no idea what he was doing around these brown bears and because of his careless actions, he and his girlfriend lost their lives. He was also directly responsible for the eventual deaths of the bears that attacked him. I salute Timothy Treadwell for the ability to pull himself out of a life of heavy drug use and I also admired his determination to help the bears of Katmai. Unfortunately his complete disregard for established bear safety practices was the last thing that people and bears needed."
2,A Deathly Opinionated Book.... blahhh!,"&#2951; Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:&#1150;&#1150; Not recommended. This product gives me cold pricklies.I read both this and Nick Jans' bookThe Grizzly Maze: Timothy Treadwell's Fatal Obsession with Alaskan Bearsafter having watched the great Werner Herzog documentary filmGrizzly Man. I have not read Treadwell's ownAmong Grizzlies: Living with Wild Bears in Alaska, but, in hindsight, I feel that both the Herzog film and Nick Jans' ""Grizzly Maze"" were much better and more objective treatments of the guy. Nick Jans' writing is far better than Lapinski's also, and one gets the impression that this book was banged together too quickly. If you are deciding between either Jans' ""Grizzly Maze"" or this ""Death in the Grizzly Maze"", your time is better spent on ""Grizzly Maze""."
4,Fire that guy...,"...Anyway, in my view _Hips And Makers_ is most notable for its startling variety, accomplished with mostly acoustic guitar, accompanied by an occasional piano or cello or tambourine. Charming, mysterious, harrowing, quirky... Kristin represents a broader scope of her songwriting ability here than in most of her albums in Throwing Muses. It is saddening to realize that even the most prodigious brilliance must always remain opaque to a poor, blighted segment of the population, but no matter what, we'll always have Kristin Hersh. I have to explain, you wouldn't understand..."
3,Give it Time,"3.5 Stars is my actual rating if anyone cares. Give this album a chance and you will come to like it. As others have said, Hips and Makers will almost attack your emotions and light a power keg inside your brain. Highlights include YOUR GHOST, the album is worth it for this track alone, just a great opener. TEETH, which features beautiful guitar picking and touching lyrics. The simplicity and loveliness of CUCKOO. The confessional LETTER. I'll admit that you have to be in the right kind of mood to listen to this music (15 songs), but it's one of those albums that just seems a little deeper than the others."
4,California surfing,"Good little kind of documentary or Malibu, Huntington Beach, and Maverick's near Half Moon Bay. Seem like it is done from the late 90's."
5,Takes a beating and hasn't aged a bit,"This little Hudson Hornet car goes EVERYWHERE with my son. He plays with it in the dirt, in the bathtub, and anywhere else he goes. I've had to wash it too and it still works great and doesn't look worn on the outside."
3,Bring back Doug Yule,"This album would be great except for one thing. Lou Reed has completely forgotten (or perhaps lost the ability) how to sing anything beyond a monotone. He sounds bored. The rest of the band is kicking butt. One only needs contrast this with his performance of Sweet Jane at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame concert to see he still can sing with power if he wants to. Unfortunately, this seems to be a paycheck performance."
2,Essential only for hard-core fans.,"Get this CD if you already have all 4 of their albums, 1969 live, and the box set. If you are still hungry for VU (and you probably will be) THEN get this set. But beware: 1993 is over 20 years after they disbanded and the energy that pervades their earlier recordings is not present here. This isn't a completely meritless collection. It's fun more than anything. Reed doesn't actually sing, he talks through the songs like he does on his solo albums. This is an interesting collection, not a fascinating one like their 60's recordings."
2,Unnecessary,"I'm sorry, but this album is not needed. I love the Velvets as much as anybody, but this album pales in comparison to any of the original live albums. I want my VU albums to be groundbreaking! This is nowhere near that. Just your usual rock and roll. The superb VU atmosphere and sound is not present here. Who cares about the sound quality, if the music is not as good as it was? Go for the old stuff instead."
4,Open Back a Problem,"My 19 month old son loves this climber. However, the design of the back side makes it possible to have a pretty nasty 3-4 foot fall if a child were to lean or slide too far back while sitting on the top platform. With older children this may not be such a problem, but for them the short slide will be pretty tame. Also shipping added about 30% to the cost."
2,bead and wire art,"I was very excited when I received this book. It has interesting and different designs and the projects are pretty. However, I have had trouble trying to replicate these projects with my own hands. I have been working with wire for a couple of years, and I would classify myself in an intermdiate skill level. I felt like the projects that were listed as an intermediate difficulty were actually pretty hard, which has intimidated me and made me feel like I will never be able to do the advanced projects."
2,Wouldn't want to wear most of the projects,"I was disappointed in this book. First, a lot of the projects are VERY basic, and similar projects are covered in other books, so if you've read one or two other wireworking books, this will be a repeat. Since the instructions are not very detailed, so a beginner might find other books more useful. There were very few projects I would want to wear, though, in all fairness, I found a few good ideas that might inspire me. There are also a few bead stitching projects, something I did not want to see in what I had hoped was a wireworking book. While some obviously liked this book, for the most part, I didn't."
2,disapointed,"If i had looked at this book before buying it, I definatly wouldn't of bought it. The instructions were very brief and hard to understand. There was plenty of empty space for the author to put in step by step diagrams, buut there wasn't any. The projects weren't that nice either. In the whole book I only made about 2 of them. there are a lot better free wireworking projects on the wigjig website"
1,Unfresh product,"I am very disappointed in this product. The first box was 75% hard, not a soft powder in each envelope. When I called to complain, I got fast results in getting a new box. The new box was 25% hard. I do not blame Saco, but whoever stored it incorrectly or for too long. The fresher envelopes did make great buttermilk biscuits."
4,Broke but fixed it by Zojirushi,"This is a great rice cooker, Zojirushi NP-HBC10, but it lasted just a little over a year. I bought it in November 2009 and die in February 2011. I have read another review stating a similar experience before I bought this but I took a chance anyway and I ended up paying for it with no rice to eat and lighter pocket tonight, so BUYER BE WARNED!!!Review updated on May 2011I would like to say that I contacted Zojirushi and they offered to fixed it at NO COST to me although my one year warranty has expired. All I had to pay for was the shipping cost. It is working perfectly again."
5,Amazing,"This rice cooker is the one to get; it's pricier than the aluminum models, but it's made in Japan (not China), and everything inside and out is stainless steel. Everything about it is good, except possibly for the Twinkle Twinkle Little Star music it plays when it starts...you can change it but I haven't figured out how yet."
3,Difficult payment handling,"When the estimated delivery date came, I checked online, and found that there was a difficulty in the payment, so I tried to straighten it out, but I continued to have problems, so I tried to cancel the order, but it couldn't be canceled because it was in process. I went to a store and bought the same item, without any delay. Eventually the second one arrived, which we will gift to our daughter. Payment process is difficult and awkward."
5,ITEM MEET MY EXPECTATIONS,Now we start to enjoy rice so much. Every time we have result 10 from 10on quality scale. Only one problem with Zojirushi --- company do not provide recipes bookfor rice cooker. I think it is very good marketing tool for product.Zojirushi Has Done the perfect design with NP- HBC10 rice cooker except--- how to change battery at HOME without sending unit out ???? Really not smart idea
5,always great rice,I just got this rice cooker and I love it. I'm sorry that I waited so long to buy it. I had a cheap rice cooker and it was terrible... I'd rather cook rice on the stove. The Zojirushi is always good whether you cook Japanese rice or regular rice but it does take longer to cook the rice 45-60 minutes. It is easy to clean.My only regrets... not getting it sooner and not getting the 10 cup size but the 5 cup is great for everyday.
2,Not for use with THIN KERF BLADES!,"I knew it was overpriced, but then that's to be expected with Delta (which now owns Biesmeyer) :( But the worst of it is that the spreader portion measures .120"". Thus, thin kerf blades can not be used with this product. I called the manufacturer to see if a thin kerf spreader was available: it is not. With a major investment in thin kerf blades and no desire to go back to .125"" kerf blades, I either machine down the spreader (more$$) or return it and do without. Hmmm......"
4,Great Safety Device,"Indeed the spreader is somewhat over priced but really does the job it was intended to do. Being heavy duty makes is one of the reasons it's wide at the base. Although never mentioned in any descriptions, this safety device cannot be intended for thin kerf blades. It's just too wide at the base. There are other spreaders out there that are made for a thin kerf blades but much easier to bend as well. The one I bought needed some ""thining"" to get it to work with a standard blade kerf. A few moments on the sander and it was ready to use and works just great. When it's time to remove the unit it only takes a few seconds and I'm ready to go back to work. I did't rate it 5 stars because I had to rework it some to make it work as it should. Considering it's cost, reworking, should not be in the formula. (This is the second one I purchased, the first one did not need any rework, must be a QC problem). Once installed and working properly it's a great heavy duty safety device."
3,Overpriced but works.,"I've had this splitter for about 6 years. It works as advertised but it's absurdly overpriced. I'm surprised another company has not offered a similar proiduct at half the cost.As was stated earlier - not for use with thin kerf blades. Also, be careful when inserting and removing it - it's very easy to bend laterally which then requires that you bend it back so it's straight up and down. Mine's been bent a few times and it's now pretty tough to get straight..."
1,Shop elsewhere !,Everything was cool til I opened the package. Item arrived as quickly as possible ! BUT.....it was the wrong Item...not even close. When I contacted the seller they credited my account and cancelled the order !
5,Phenomenal and unique belter,"I can't even find the word to express how much I love Julia Murney's voice. It's kind of a love it or hate it sound, but she's got a belt that is out of this world."
2,Slumming among the Blockbusters,"This book has been billed as a literary thriller, but--and this is sad, as Ms. Hospital is a writer with considerable gifts--it works only fitfully as a thriller and never even a hint of a whiff of a little as a literary novel. It's turgid and stagy; the main characters are badly underdeveloped; and the climactic scene in the terrorist bunker is as staggeringly pretentious a bit of hooey as I've ever read. That said, the book has some lovely lines, some persuasive details, and enough narrative momentum that I did slog through to the end. Due Preparations reads like the work of someone a little too desperate to write a blockbuster . . . and at the same time Ms. Hospital asserts her literary ambitions and respectability by strewing the text with clumsy allusions to Defoe and Camus and and Boccaccio."
5,A pageturner!,"This is the second time I have read this book, I was happy to find it's been reprinted! It has excellent pacing and good character development--and it's REALISTIC; also with humor (very hard to find a quick wit in the average horror novel). The authors obviously studied up to make it accurate, historically and culturally (I hope they don't know from experience! ha ha). I am most impressed with this book! Cheers to Mara and Traci!"
2,Great for background music,"I like the guy a lot, but this cd is obviously made to satisfy some contract. There are only a few cuts where Knopfler's guitar is obvious. Nothing is offensive, but the music is best for an occasion when you don't want it noticed."
3,Doesn't Compare to the Show,I've seen two of the Forbidden Broadway shows and enjoyed them both very much. This album is a poor substitute for seeing the shows. The songs don't hold up very well without the ingratiating stage performances and costumes of the typically excellent cast. It is very hard to understand the lyrics on most of the songs on the CD.
3,Enjoyable,"If there is one thing I love about Barry,it's his talent for creating original offbeat characters.This book is fun.It isn't meant to be taken too seriously.Therefore the sensible thing to do is not take it seriously.Just read it and have a good time.That's what I did."
2,Not too impressed,"Overall, an OK Broadway recording to add to your collection, but there are others that are more worth your money. Previous recordings of The Music Man are much better, and are more true to the way Meredith Willson created it. The modern up-beat percussion of ""Rock Island"" I found to be very annoying. Bierko sounds very good as Harold Hill, but he seems to basically be a re-creation of Robert Preston as Harold Hill. If you already have a recording of The Music Man, you probably own something that is better than this."
2,Simply ghastly...,"no friends this is not the wonderfull music man you may have heard on the previous cast albums or in the film. While there are some wonderfull things on this album that make it worth the purchase such as the dance music on several numbers, The Pick-A-Little reprise, and a few others. But when it coems down to it the album is inferior to the orginal. Im not referring to the gentelman who portrays Harold Hill or the lady who portrays Marian as they are both marvelous. But everything else lacks the smooth flow of the orginals. Forget the revival and get the original."
5,Fresh and Musky,"Originally a friend suggested I try an after shave balm; the first time I purchased Escada was on a whim and a sale at a local store. A brief whiff enticed me. It wasn't too sweet and not to earthy - nor too musky. It made me feel like a 'gentle' man. The other important element is that it is a balm. Daily shaving for work used to leave my skin scratchy and raw! The balm is a soothing lotion and helps heal any nicks from shaving. I still use other brands for different occasions but this is my ""go-to"" for daily shaving needs."
5,An Excellent Text for Teachers and Students Alike,"An excellent text that explains the various ways a media text can be analysed. As someone in grad school to one day teach Media Literacy, I would highly recommend this book. It addresses not only academic concepts regarding media, it teaches a set of skills for audiences to actively apply as they consume media. This books helps students become better critical thinkers."
3,Not as much fun for little ones,"I'm am a huge fan of music in general and will get up to dance to the YMCA at any wedding :), however the E-L-M-O did not really meet my expectations.PROS- Helps child start to learn spelling of ELMO- Helps child learn to make the shapes of the letters in ELMO- somewhat catchy tune for adults- seems to be pretty durable even though the arms are jointed in several places (although makes clicking noise when something is blocking it's motion)- Words are fairly clear and volume seems to be at a good level.CONS- The motions always seem to lag behind the words, so it's hard for a child to follow along- The actions are not very ""dramatic"" therefore it's hard for a child to understand what actions ELMO is really doing (the only reason dd knows what to do is because we've shown her the actual motions)ALL IN ALL, I WOULD NOT SPEND THE MONEY ON THIS ONE. THERE ARE BETTER ELMO PRODUCTS OUT THERE."
2,Morris Offers Cardboard Characters and No Imagination,"If you've read one of these books, you've read them all. The characters in these books are flat, boring, and stereotypical. Morris seems to be suffering from senility, as he has a habit of changing his characters' eye color or hair color from book to book. This annoying problem is obviously partly a lack of good editing, but also leaves you with the feeling that Morris does not know his own characters- a serious flaw! The romances in these books are passionless and so predictable they made me laugh. The only redeeming quality these books possess is their interesting historical settings. Even the history, however, is made somewhat boring and colorless by Morris's comic book style. These books can be described in one word- predictable."
2,Keep looking,"An interesting book at best. If you are looking for a book filled with page layouts and designs that market themselves only to the trade, then this one's for you. I agree with the review that suggests this book as a great addition to your library of graphic design books . . . however, I did not find it to be helpful in developing page layouts for real life clients. It IS a wonderful collection of cutting edge design but it misses the mark for designers needing inspiration for down-to-earth and corporate-type clients."
1,Amazon.com are liars,"I ordered this CD on Novemeber 22, 2005. It is now March 3, 2006 and I STILL haven't received the CD. They just keep e-mailing me every month and delaying the CD saying we will ship it next month. I paid for this item in full and everytime I call they say we will ship it next month. They must assume that I will give up and just say give me a refund. But I want my CD that I paid for, and they are going to get it. This service is horrible, the customer service lie to you all the time. NEVER, EVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM THESE PEOPLE AGAIN. 5 MONTHS FOR A CD THAT THEY SAID WOULD BE DELIEVERED IN DECEMBER 2005. Please don't order from these people I would hate to see someone in the position they put me in. They just lie and lie."
4,"extremely basic kit Solenoid, wire, button","This kit works. It does what it's supposed to do.But for the price, I thought it'd be more specialized. I though there would be some way to clamp it from the cable to the latch mechanism on the trunk. You'll have to jury rig that yourself."
5,the ultimate fighting game,This is the only fighting game that allows four players to play completely simultaneously. There are many different options to chose from which adds to the addiction to the game. The game is different every time and it is just really fun to see what the outcome will be
1,"Get,s old.","It gets really boring when you beat a Thousands of times.When i first bought it was so awsome!!But as kept on beaten the game it got boring.Although buy it you get secret stuff like luigi,Capt.Falcon,Jigglypuff,and,Ness.So buy it.It,s great until you beat hundreds of time then you gets boring."
4,One word springs to mind... Addictive...,All the words I can think of that describe this game:Cool Exciting Addictive Mind-Bending Crazy Increased-Blood-Pressure Wicked Graphics StunningShall I go on? Or leave you to buy the game yourself...
3,The graphics ...!!!,"This game is fun with friends, but not as good solo. Its fun while you get characters and stages. They could've done better with the graphics. What were they thinking?...But still, I recommend this game if you have friends."
4,Super Smash Bros Review,"Super Smash Bros is an interesting fighting game. It shows people how the company thinks nintendo game characters can fight. There are characters from the old SNES and the present N64. It is a fun game but eventually you'll get sick of it. The graphics are pretty bad, and there is hardly a variety of moves, but it's fun. There are secret people, hidden levels, etc. It is challenging and is much more fun with 2+ people. It is frustrating with one player if you try it to hard. There are no combos or health bars. At the bottom it will show how many lives each player has and how much damage is on him. Unlike other fighting games the only way to kill people is by knocking them off the edge or by hitting the so far up they go out of sight. It doesn't take off of any fighting games and is probably one of the best N64 has to offer."
4,ding,"This is a great fighting game. There is agood selection of characters. The caracters are Samus Aran, Link, jigglypuff,pikachu, Captain Falcon, Mario, Ness, Luigi,D.k.and Kirby. There are also different battle zones. The grahics aren't so good but it is still a great game."
2,if you want to bribe people into liking you this is the game,"When I got this game, I had extremely high hopes. I had seen the ads on TV, and this was the only reason I bought my N64. After about an hour, though, I soon grew bored. I had found it extremely easy to beat the 1 player mode with ""extra hard"" on and only one life. Neither of my parents wanted to play, and I could defeat the computer instantly. When a boy at my school found out that I had SSB, however, he would follow me home and play with me every day. I guess some people enjoy this game but I didnt. I found it way too easy and unless you have someone to play with, extremely boring. I reccomend this game to someone who is willing to find someone to play with them."
2,Gets Old Real Fast,"I've played this game before, I have it actually. But it's not fun at all. It gets boring very quickly. In a Squaresoft game call Ehergiez, I think, it has the same stuff except also a game to go with it. That would be a much better game to get than this one."
4,Pretty good,"I liked the game, but it got boring after a while because you just do the same thing again and again."
5,Smashing!!,"A very exciting and fun fighting game; Super Smash Bros. is definentally worthy of my approval. In this great multiplayer game you fight opponents using awesome moves and killer items. There are also a variety of levels, each containing their own special dangers. The object of the game is to knock your opponent off the edge of the thing you are fighting on. It could range from a spaceship in the star-e-ness of space to the tops of skyscrapers!Each fighter has their own special moves and abilities to crush other fighters with. Their moves are not hard to learn, so you can get pretty good at the game in a relitively short time.Also, Super Smash Bros. doesn't get boring after you beat it. I've had the game for about three, four years and I still love it. And if you get this AWESOME multiplayer combat game hopefully you will too."
5,Best reusable bag,"I use three different sizes of these bags and they have all held up for 5 years so far, and I bake a lot! Easy to wash and dry, they are soft and silky so they are pliable and not too stiff when trying to pipe. I would reccommend to anyone, especially if you are using disposable ones, you have to try at least one. Buy the 10 inch and start from there.Check out [...] to see what I have piped using these bags."
1,it's not worth it,"It gets fogged up, so it's basically useless for racquetball.Also, mine got broken after a few weeks..."
5,A new twist on the classic Little Tikes Cozy Coupe Car,"My son received this from his grandmother as an early birthday gift. When he first saw it, he got a big grin on his face and climbed right in. Besides ""driving"" it around, he loves to just climbs in and out of it, open and close the door, and push the button on the ""radio"", which makes 2 different siren sounds. I often see him just sitting inside the car smiling. It is great for imaginary play!"
2,"DAMAGED VEHICLE, THE TIRES AND STEARING WHEEL DO NOT STAY IN","AT FIRST I HAD FUN. BUT IT DID'NT LAST LONG BECAUSE THE WHEELS AND STEARING WHEEL DO NOT STAY IN PLACE. I WOULD LIKE TO ORDER REPLACEMENTS SO I CAN ENJOY MY CAR, BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO ORDER."
4,Every young cops dream!,"Wow! He loves it! He's really into the whole police thing, and he loves it! He chases the other kids on there cars, and gives them all tickets for doing something wrong. Very Cute!"
4,My child loves it!,I purchased this car for my son's 2nd birthday. He loves getting in and out of the door. I would recommend this toy.We had to put it in his bedroom the first night we had it and it was the first thing he asked for the next morning.
1,Bought second hand..... Unfortunately no refunds given,"If you are looking for something actually educational about Japan and it's secrets... keep looking.This volume is an extended rant by an obviously disatisfied outsider who managed to learn that Japan is a society where rule dictates action (SHOCK!) and not reason or free thought. Oddly enough, the author was astute enough to descern even some of the more obsure dictates of Japanese society, yet seems to have been completely dumbstruck by the concept that his time in Japan would be better served attempting to fit into the rules instead of acting like a dumbstruck tourist. This book comes off as little more then a baby ""waaaa"" rant that Japan isn't a western nation, foreigners are not equal to Japanese, and no.. you're opinion really isn't wanted. I suspect half or more of the authors semi-fictional difficulties with the Japanese could have been easily avoided had he merely followed the rules he clearly knew enough about to write in the book."
2,doesn't live up to the KitchenAid brand name,"The non stick coating on my set was wore down after only 3 years. I wish I had kept the paperwork, I would be getting them replaced right now. Instead, I think I will go with another brand for my cookware. All of my other KitchenAid items have been better than great, so I am very dissappointed with my set of pans."
2,Reinforcing Mathematical Misconceptions,"Although the text is rhythmic and engaging and the illustrations are fun, the author claims that ""Equals can be used like is, or totals, or makes."" This simply isn't accurate. The equal sign means ""the same as."" 3 + 2 is the same as 5 or 5 is the same as 3 + 2 or 4 + 1 is the same as 3 + 2. In the context of this book, children will continue to misunderstand the equal sign."
1,Streams of confusing consciousness,"This, like all of Osho's books I have read, seems to contain a lot of words and very little content. There are snippets that offer food for thought but overall it is repetitive and, in my view, poorly written."
4,Elite 3200 Scope,This scope has been on my rifle for almost a year and a half and has been used extensively hunting and target shooting. Probably have 700 rounds through the rifle/scope combo. Works well although the turret adjustmnet is not consistent I can shoot out too 600 pretty effectively. Good scope for the money as I picked it up on sale.
2,Great acting in 'Meh' movie,"Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling? SOLD! I could care less about the film, but I love these two actors so I was very excited to see this movie. All I can say about it is...well...great acting and 'meh' movie. I thought the camera work was choppy and didn't add much to the actual story. In fact, I dare say it took away from it. I know the director wanted the viewer to feel as fragile and vulnerable as the two main characters by hand-holding the camera, but instead it left me feeling nauseous.Although I thought the story was there, I just felt that I had no true feeling for either main character and in the end I found myself thinking 'They're both butt-heads, who cares?'But, again, Michelle Williams AND Ryan Gosling! Incredible actors worth watching every time!"
4,Fire Cracker Type of Love,"It's dark, which I love. But, It's also a very great depiction of the way resentment and guilt can deteriorate a pure love."
2,Yawn meter high,"This film is another in the genre of movies = watching people living their boring, depressing, ordinary lives. Michelle Williams mopes around convincingly, but she's such a depressing sulk, who cares about her and her crummy life. Williams gets pregnant in high school, abandons her life plans to be a Dr. and marries a loser. Since when did this constitute a movie plot? You could watch any fat slob with unwanted children in a trailer park and it would be the same entertainment level. I particularly like how they aged Ryan Gosling like 25 years (his fake pattern baldness was a gem), but Michelle Williams looks identical to her teenage self. You see, they flash between the present and past to seem deep and artsy. Finally, Michelle W. realizes Ryan is a baby, and doesn't want to raise two children, and she leaves. Movie over. Many yawns for this one. Will someone tell Hollywood to bring back the radical concepts of plot and action."
1,Not into it...,"I thought I could see them improvising, it just didn't seem like enough material for them to work with. Top 10 of the year? What?"
2,Durge,"This film is durgey and dank in combination. I'm not a fan of Ryan Gosling so I think that is why I didn't connect with his character. Michelle Williams is hit or miss. I liked her in Shutter Island and If These Walls Could Talk 2. Another thing I didn't like about this film is it was filmed docudrama style. There was something odd going on when the camera was rolling. It was filmed pretty harsh so it wasn't easy on the eyes. I understand they wanted this film to be charactery, with alot of character types roaming around. I saw right through this attempt. I also hated the character that played Michelle Williams other love interest. He was a typical white guy who looked like he should stick to gay porn. I DID NOT need to see her having sex and bent over. I can see how some people could relate to the story, but this film was depressing and dark in a bad way. All the dialogue and drama was in vain, I couldn't care less about either character, it's like break up or shut up."
3,Semi OK,"ENDing breaker, sorry Spoiler.""Blue Valentine,"" with: Michelle Williams, Ryan Gosling, Derek Cianfrance, Joey Curtis, and Cami Delavigne; the cast made up good and believable charters. However, saying this cast was good I felt something missing like a closing that was more positive ending. I wanted to like this film and all I felt was sick for the wife and kids as well as sick for the upcoming child. There was no happy ever after and definitely no moral codes in their up bringing.This film should not be seen with children. It is rated NC-17."
2,set-up is torture,"I have a shop full of tools ranging in quality from harbour freight to festool and I have never been so upset while trying to assemble a tool!!The video is so worthless they could just as well send a dvd on birdwatching.An absolute joke.the manual is no better.whats more I had to use a grinder,WD-40 and a hammer to insert the rod that holds the follower.Also one of the plastic knobs would not screw all the way down on the threaded post used to run the cutter back and forth.The brackets that connect the tool to the lathe are bare steel,how hard could it be for them to spray on a little primer?When I pay $640.00 I expect to get a lot better product than this.I believe that vega has the best product on the market,but it seems they need some competition to wake them up.oh and it seems to work fine if you make it through the assembly."
2,Mommy Dearest,"As a mother of adopted children, I would be interested to have this book reviewed through the eyes of an expert on Attachment Disorder. I cannot defend Joan Crawford; neither can I say her adopted daughter is a liar. But I can say from first hand experience that an adopted child often deals with attachment issues of varying degrees. Without healthy attachment from the adoptee, the adoptive Mom can become the target for all sorts of rage and fabricated stories intended to destroy her."
1,Deeply fabricated thru Christina's eyes,"Christina Crawford failed at becoming a success at anything. She couldn't act, couldn't stick with one job...and continued to accept money from her ""horribly abusive"" Mother.If Joan was indeed that cruel, I seriously doubt that Christina would spend many a evening with her in NY and be in touch nearly everyday. So what is left to do, that might bring in a couple bucks and exaggerate an unhappy child that Christina was?You got it, write a book and publish it AFTER JOAN CRAWFORD HAS DIED...SO IT CAN ALWAYS REMAIN ONE SIDED AND SYMPATHETIC FOR CHRISTINA.Both her husbands have admitted they believe her story was concocted,Christina admitted in print, she was never beaten with a wire hanger.The other children have denied Joan was a child abuser.This book is trashy, untrue, and reveals a very jealous, spoiled sad for herself,daughter of a legend.......this book doesn't deserve space on your bookshelf."
4,Interesting and gripping,"Whether this book was written for attention, or to expose the truth, I enjoyed it very much. Those who mentioned the errors in grammar better check their own spellings of words, while they're at it. I found quite a few in their reviews!Anyone who ""follows"" celebrities has to know that most of the time, they wear 2 faces--their private face and their public face. Many times, there is not too big a difference between both, but sometimes, there is. It shouldn't be a shock to learn that there ARE dysfunctional people out there, in all walks of life! Just because a person is a rich celebrity, it doesn't make them immune from being a horrible person!"
2,Great idea,"I love the idea of a snap in splitter! I've been using my snap-in spreader for about two months now. The splitter is slightly wider than an 1/8th of an inch. When the kerf contacts the splitter it can get hard to push the wood through. I finally had it with this splitter when I was ripping a piece of 12/4 Cherry and it got stuck on the splitter, much like an ax in wood. I had to stop the saw and whack the wood off the splitter. I finally called Biesemeyer, they said that it should be an 1/8th inch thick, they're sending a replacement. It is definitely not for a thin kerf blade. As for my blade, its an 1/8th inch Tenryu (I wanted to be different and got this blade over a Forrest) that cuts exactly 1/8th inch kerfs. I'll follow-up when the replacement arrives"
4,Needed for a class,Had to have it for a class. Had some interesting stories. Wouldn't have read any of these if not required but very interesting.
4,economical charcoal filters,"The price is great, however one must note these do not have the perferations allowing for easy adjustment of size like the one you normally buy. The filters are such a great savings."
1,Total Garbage!!,"It was advertised as a ""2 Pack"". When it arrived it turned out to be just one big sheet of the stuff. SO as the consumer they expect you to measure and cut the one big sheet into twop sheets that fit. GOOD LUCK! Even if you do get it cut right it makes a HUGE mess with all the fibers falling of it while you cut. Dont waste your money!!!"
3,"Starts off great, then looses enthusiam","It this were an album, the first side would be given a 10, then the second side would be given a 5, hence the 3 rating.After the 5th song, the other songs lose enthusiam, tone and bite. They could have been performed better.Sample the whole recording before you buyHope this review saves you money to buy another cd.By the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves. With some who are less mature, this the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews"
1,"Cute pictures, offensive text","I purchased this book after looking at the cute pop up pictures. When I got home and read the text, I was shocked. The book is pro evolution and becomes offensive when it mocks God who is referred to as Glob. Those who believe in God are labeled ""mental."" The author seems to be using his children's book to vent his anger against God and religion. This book is in no way a science book and based on the pictures it appears to be a fun pop-up. The text is inappropriate for the target age of 4-8 and it is offensive. The book teaches ridicule and intolerance. These are not qualities I'm seeking to teach my children and I highly recommend against purchasing this book."
4,good but not mine,the book was in great condition but i have returned it because i requested the wrong book.
1,Residential Mortgage Loan Origination Made Easy,"I went ahead and paid a whopping $137.99 for this book based on the write up and one glowing review. I've worked in this industry for 2+ years in the admin dept and wanted to truly understand the ins and outs of the business, rate sheets, etc. before making the jump to a commission only job. Guess what? The book is padded by printing only one side of the page to make it appear more substantial than it is. Many, many pages are copies of loan application forms, disclosures, etc. that are completely self explanatory. There is ONE page (barely - 3 inch margins all around) explaining rate sheets - the biggest mystery to new loan officers - in the entire book. I hope I can get a refund. This book isn't worth $19.95, let alone $137.99. Its a total rip off."
5,"Excellent Book, High Price for a Pamphlet","I paid about $35 for this book. It was recommended by the excellent tailoring website [...]. It's a very clear book, but I did think it was expensive for a short, velobound pamphlet."
3,Exactly what I would expect from Stork Craft,We purchased this to use as a dresser/changing table because we have a very small nursery. The changing table pad is slightly too big but it still works. The quality of craftsmanship is what you would expect from Stork Craft. Cheap wood & you have to be really careful when assembling this to not damage the wood.
1,I ordered espresso but got black!,"I can't explain how upset I am! I ordered espresso (like the last reviewer) but received Black. My order read black, but I know I did not register for nor order black. Amazon is seriously messed up, they say it is my fault for ordering ""the wrong color"" so I have to pay for the return shipping! My husband and I are currently stationed (US Coast Guard) in Puerto Rico so the cost to ship it back isn't even worth it! Now I'm going to have all espresso furniture with a BLACK dresser!!! So mad with Amazon's horrible customer service! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM UNLESS YOU WANT IT IN BLACK!!!"
2,Not happy with quality or appearance,"I chose this dresser for two reasons: real wood, and the changing area on top. Some of the decorative pieces are made of solid wood, but the structural pieces are actually MDF. It took my husband two nights to assemble this thing. The instructions were not clear, and the pieces were difficult to put together. When it was all assembled, it was really obvious that the drawer boxes are not square, so the drawers do not sit right. There are ugly gaps on the sides, top, and bottom of the drawers, making it all look cheap and junky. The drawers are also really shallow, so this will not be a piece of furniture that will be useful for very long. Disappointed with this item."
3,Changing Table/Dresser,"I bought this hoping that it was going to be of good quality, etc. especially considering how much I had to pay for it... Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Not only was it pressed wood instead of solid wood like I had believed, there were places where this was already taking its toll. For instance, one of the drawers was beginning to split so I have had a difficult time getting it to align properly and fit right (I will have my husband look at it when he gets home-hopefully his patience level is a little higher than mine is right now...)Also the holes weren't drilled very well so I had a difficult time putting together some parts of it. I basically expected much more for something I paid over $200 for. Sad that I was yet again disappointed by a furniture purchase on Amazon."
4,great forchildren,"If you have a child who is into reptiles and you can't stand snakes, this is the book to give."
4,Average Product,"Decent product. I like Philosophy, so I tried it. I wouldn't say it's the greatest shave gel ever, but it makes for a slightly smoother shave."
3,Not a shaving minimizer,"I bought this hoping I could shave less often. No such luck. It only takes a tiny bit for each leg so it is going to last me forever, but I wish I could shave a little less often. Only slightly better than the cheaper brands."
2,"DON""T leave on burner!",Loved this pan for the first couple of weeks........until I left it on the burner with no food in it for about 10min........it warped and now does not heat evenly! VERY disappointed.
2,"I like some DCD, but this one is not for my ears","I have ""Into the Labyrinth"" and ""Selections from North America"". I like all of Labyrinth and much of Selections. I found nothing I like on this album, DCD\DCD. To me the vocals, lyrics and overall sound come off as compressed and not interesting. For me it fits better in the noise category than the music category. Give it a listen to see what you think."
2,Well...,"Dead Can Dance (the group) is amazing, I love them, but this albun is not their best. Their experiments into industrial sounds did not really complement Lisa Gerrard's phenomenal voice, and it is just too diffrent from the rest of their body of work. I have all of DCD's albums, but, even if this one has some good pieces, it is the one I listen to the least."
4,A classic,"This is a great album, very inventive and unprecedented in its scope. It is one of a handful of albums from trhe late 70s to early 80s period that has the dark, raw sound that would come to be known as ""goth""."
3,"cute, but cheap","Other reviewers talked about how great this product is. I have a different opinion. I just received the box, and I pulled out the ratchet to place a bit in it and when I took the bit out, the cap of the ratchet flew off and the black handle came off. I put everything back together, but this is supposed to be new. I know the previous reviewers are excited that the tools are pink and cute which is the same reason why I bought it, but I also purchase the apollo pink tool kit several months ago (last June). That's a good kit . The box it strong (unlike this one), and most of the tools are durable. I'm also not happy about the pliers. They have small brittle springs that ""crunch"" when you squeeze the pliers. Sorry I'm not pleased with this kit. I thought it would be of similar quality as the pink apollo tool kit, but I was wrong. I'm think of sending this back."
1,Utterly Useless,"I too am moving to Chicago and thought this would be a great resource. This book is of no value whatsoever unless you purchase the actual map for an additional $20+. It's just an index that lists which section of the map each neighborhood is in and which streets are its borders!The description is extremely misleading. ""Product Description: The Chicago Neighborhood Boundaries Directory, the companion book to the Chicago Neighborhood Map, is the most thorough and comprehensive work ever done on Chicago's 222 neighborhood boundaries in the city's history."" So, if you're looking for a book that gives you a description and highlights of each neighborhood then THIS IS NOT THE BOOK TO GET.I'm even more bothered because now I have to pay the return shipping cost for this item."
4,Not your typical work of fiction,"I initially read this book because I came across a review of Grant Morrison's Invisibles in which that person stated the basis for that work plot was taken from ""The Final Programme"". After reading this book, I can say it is a real head trip. This author's work is very imaginative and crosses a lot of boundaries. The ending is left open so those persons who like clearly defined conclusions will be disappointed. But if you like genre bending weird fiction then you will probably enjoy this book."
3,Tupperware mini weatherproof S&P shakers,"Purchased for use in a summer lakefront cottage that suffers heavy humidity. Pros: airtight, small enough for a small table but large enough to require only infrequent refill. Nice shape and color. Cons: Not eligible for free shipping when purchased with other items, so the overall price is way too high. Seems like an item that Amazon should stock and ship itself."
5,Great,"Look as described, seal great and function as they should. Nothing fancy, but if I drop it on my stove, they won't chip the ceramic flat top..."
3,3.5 stars,"This is another of Janet Evanovich's rereleased romance novels. In my opinion, this is the weakest of the bunch so far. There is, of course, her signature humor and wit, but the plot is lacking. I just read it yesterday and I can't even remember what happened - maybe because not much did?It was cute, but not very satisfying."
1,Ridiculously high price!!,"I cannot say enough good things, about this brilliant early TV western, starring the great Clint Walker, which ran for years when I was growing up, from the fifties through the sixties (I own the first series) & while I am jazzed, with the release (finally) of the second season, I cannot see spending this much! 5 stars for the series, 1 star for the ridiculously high price, which will keep many people away, myself included, unfortunately!"
5,GREAT STUFF,I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS TO COME OUT FOR A LONG TIME. BUT ITS WELL WORTH THE WAIT.YOU HANG IN THERE CLINT DON'T GO RIDING INTO THE SUNSET JUST YET
4,THESE ARE THE BAD GUYS?,"Sure, James Stewart and Dean Martin have been in better westerns, THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE and RIO BRAVO, to name a few. Both of the aforementioned classics had John Wayne. The Duke isn't needed here in this great little romp and stomp and Jimmy and Dino had to have a blast playing the bad guys for a change. BANDOLERO! has some great scenes outside of Raquel Welch baking in the Mexican sun. It's well paced, anti-cliched, yet true to the formula Andrew V. McLaglen honed his craft on. Jerry Goldsmith delivers a haunting soundtrack."
1,Very poor camera,"Most pictures are blurred, the camera is very sensitive to shake/vibration. Also most indoor photos are too dark/dim even with flash. The color calibartion is poor too. Don't spend money on this product. It was bought for one of my teens and she would not accept it. It was replaced with a canon that was 100 times better."
2,Unacceptably poor battery performance,"Using the two included Panasonic alkaline batteries the unit came from, I ran out of juice after taking a dozen pictures and transferring one (as test) to my computer. My old, battered, taped-together Nikon Coolpix 5200 (does everybody have trouble with broken battery doors on Coolpix units?) *never* gave me a low-battery warning. The rechargeable battery seems to run forever - I recharge it ""preventatively"" every 5-6 weeks! The Samsung may be OK for the money in other respects, but this kind of power management snafu pretty much turned me off the brand altogether."
5,The Best There Is,This is the best robe I have ever owned. The sleeves are long but they are made to roll up and stay that way and still look real Good.
5,"warm, very warm","Watch out. These robes run big. It's not a show-stopper or anything but this sucker is huge. I'm not a tiny person but I still have to roll the sleeves way up to prevent from getting eggs and coffee on them. This robe swaddles you--nay, it ENVELOPS. Wear this robe and you'll feel the way those street vendor bean and rice burritos feel when there's three layers of aluminum foil and paper around them. You'll be like, ""Whoa.""And another thing...being made of very thick microfleece, it's warm. Very warm. Almost too warm. If you have a truly cold house in the morning, then it's great, but if it is merely cool then the sweat may very well start to flow. If your house is 70 degrees (F) in the morning, this is probably not your robe. That's not a knock against it really, but merely a warning to those who think this robe is comparable to your garden-variety cotton robe. No way, it's in another class. Yes, I really think very highly of this robe."
4,okay,"I bought this as a gift for someone in another state. I don't know how it fit, or even if he really liked it. It looked okay to me, although the fabric was thinner than I thought it would be."
1,returning this item,Not the quality I was expecting. Will return product as soon as I can find time to get it out.
3,cute curtains,ordered these because I have the entire bedding set. A bit overpriced for what one receives but it's a nice matching set.
1,The PEZ dispenser of USB devices,"This device feels very cheap. Took 15 minutes to copy a 6 GB file to it. Maybe I mixed-up my bits and bytes, but I think that's about 6MB per second...and that seems very slow. Anyway, it's going back tomorrow."
2,"Sorry, I fell asleep","This film moves so slowly that I fell asleep halfway through it. I'm willing to watch something that pauses on the scenery etc, but this film endlessly stops for nothing to happen several minutes at a time. Just could not stay awake."
5,the best christian band around,"third day is the best christian band to come along in recent years. their music is up lifting and unlike other christian music is centered toward the Man above. they can rock the praise of God, or they can slow it down and make you feel God's presence.Time is their second cd release, and it is worth every penny you pay. this cd may not be as good as the first one, but believe me it doesn't fall to far behind the first.this is truly one cd i guarantee you can listen to all the way through and not like one song. this cd is a must have for any believer."
5,The BEST southern rock album to date!,"If you liked Third Day before, then you'll love them after hearing this new album. ""I Can't Take the Pain"" is one of those songs that convicts you and encourages you at the same time."
5,third day outdoes themselves while praising God,this is an unbelievable musical masterpiece and there is not one bad song on the cd. the lyrics are completely centered on God and they pump me up. i got this cd the day it came out and have loved it ever since. a must ahve!!!!!
2,Dull DCD,"The first Dead Can Dance song I heard was ""Towards the Within"", which absolutely mesmerized me. So when I got Spleen and Ideal for Christmas last year, I was thrilled (having previously gotten Aion from the library and enoying that)...until I put it into my CD player. This is so different from the DCD music I enjoy. Personally, I can't get enough of Lisa Gerrad's soaring glossolalia, but this CD mostly contained depressing drones in Brendan Perry's depressing, unemotional voice. It either puts m to sleep or gives me a headache. I highly recommend Spiritchaser (my favourite to date) or Into the Labyrinth."
5,Forever better then No Way Out,"P.Diddy's sophmore album is way better then his debut album ""No Way Out"".Even though this cd was not well promoted and has bad reviews this LP is much better then No way Out.Every song is hot with great beats and lyrically Diddy is good. Also with the great guests on this album it makes this LP a classic in my books."
3,Moderately Effective,"This polishing cloth works better than all-purpose metal polishing cloths, but not as well as Brasso, a liquid polisher also specifically for brass."
5,Great fit!!,"These mats slipped right in, and fit snug to keep dirt in. They pop out easy to dump dirt and clean when car is washed. They Ddon't interfear with the pedals either. Great product."
5,Nice Fit!,I bought this for my 2008 Toyota Rav4. The fit is just what I expected. This seem to be well built and keeps carpet clean.
3,Not very complete,It's a nice book but you need to have and idea in painting because it's no so basic
5,Great job!!,"I really like this CD. My favorite songs on it Include ""You're first day in heaven"" ""Little is much"" and ""What a lovely name."" N'Harmony has been doing a super job. I think in a few years they will grow to become real popular."
1,Skip this one!,"Don't get me wrong, here. I love this artist, and pride myself of having all her albums, but this one is just awful. It's not even pleasant background music, because it's rather annoying. At least ""Punishing Kiss"" had some semblance of being understandable. this one, which she claims is the album that's closest to her heart, is too pretentious, no one but her can possibly decipher whatever the message in this is. Don't waste your money on this ..., especially the expensive Japanese release. You definitely won't need high fidelity or high definition on this particular recording. What a waste of excellent talent gone utterly confused."
2,Did anyone edit this edition?,"I have an earlier edition of this book, which I think is great. I ordered a second copy here recently, and there's a major, major publishing error in this edition. No numbers are included in the book! For instance, it will say something like, ""Pericles lived from ___ to ___ B.C."" Or ""Sparta was able to marshall ____ fighting men, but Athens could recruit only ____. There are no Arabic numerals anywhere in the book though numbers that are spelled out do appear. So, somehow it went to press without the numbers being inserted. Don't buy it."
1,Didn't like it,The book is not quite good.I bought this book for the source code it offers but it is hard to UNDERSTAND. it dosen't follows even one code convesion!I truly disappointed from this book.
4,Off The Hook,"since dre is awesome!!4real..then already you know the cd will be off the hook! but i have had the chance to get the dl on this set and i know for a fact that it is off the heezy!!!and i mean that. me and my friends love all the new cds he comes out with and so do alot of other people, and he ain't goin to stop netime soon! so Buy this if you want good entertainment!"
3,"Bring the Funky Beats, Please","From the manic energy of ""Rentstrike"" to the cool beats of ""Nerd,"" Groove Collective puts an irreverent spin on the acid jazz groove. The bass and drum lay down the basic beat while groovy horns and samples float in the sky above. Great summer soundrtack."
2,another re-thread that doesn't work,a aight cut but doesn't merit lead off single.not much different in sound&Production from there last project.the Re-Mix is decent.
4,It is what it says and its not a bad book,"I mainly read this book didn't play bass when I read but it covers a lot of territory you can read other reviews to get what the book is about. I mainly wanted to say what it doesn't covers, right hand or 4 finger picking technique, I was hoping it would that why I bought it, Ill be going through book again, good book for beginners and intermediate."
1,Bass Logic,"This was anything but a comprehensive method. It is more like a reference book. I recommend Chuck Sher's new book, Foundation Exercises for Bass."
2,The usual from Haynes,"I have owned a number of Haynes manuals and this is of the same mediocre quality. On the plus side there are lots of pictures and some parts of the manual gives good descriptions of different operations. The problem is the manual tries to cover a huge range of different machines manufactured over a 20 year period. This means there are inaccuracies, omissions and lack detail when you need it. I guess in defense of Haynes most of the manual was probably written about 30 years ago and expectations were lower - but they have had a lot of time for a rewrite...... So, in summary, the manual is a useful reference - but you need to figure a lot out for yourself."
4,Great Product... if used on the right grease!,"I have used this product for years with great success... to clean my automatic espresso maker. Espresso coffee machines extract all the flavor and oils from coffee, but the residue builds up and is really difficult to remove, especially from the internal parts of the machine. This product is every bit as effective as the much more expensive tablets the manufacturers recommend, and you can use less: 1/4 to 1/2 tablet does it.Try it on stained coffee and tea cups and mugs as well."
1,"Good Idea, Bad Execution","All I can say is thank God I got this game as a gift, and did not waste a penny on this piece of crap.I loved the idea of incorporating a ""life"" story to go along with a basketball game. Unfortunately, I think by adding this little ditty to the game, they decided to take major shortcuts with the rest of it.The gameplay is completely sloppy. Certain players (Lebron, AI for examples) almost NEVER MISS a shot, no matter how impossible. Your control over your player is spotty, and every game looks exactly the same (minus the team's logo at center court).I also own NBA Live 2006, which for a few dollars more, far exceeds this piece of junk hands down. If you really want to see what this game is like, rent it. At least that way, you only lose a few dollars for a couple of days of boredom."
1,Don' buy it!,"The metal was so flimsy it couldn't hold it's shape. Made of the lightest weight metal possible. I wound up buying another from a different company - theirs was stronger, less flimsy AND even had a handle."
3,Not Bad. Not great.,"There's absolutely nothing wrong with ""Writing Screenplays that Sell"" and that may be what's wrong with it; it's informative, comprehensive, logically structured, full of ""examples"" fromwell-known scripts...and nearly indistinguishable from the 30 or 40 other titles taking more or less the same approach to the same subject."
4,Dogs love it... just not mine,My dog is a finicky eater so I wasn't really expecting him to eat this... however the people I gave this food to said their dog enjoyed it. So it seems like good dog food.
2,They break,"I have used these few times. They come undone and they break easily. I have 2 out of 6 left due to breakage. You can use them for rolled items like roasts, but not for birds; nothing that needs a tight tie can be trussed with these.However, they withstand the heat and are easy to clean."
4,Mobile Base,"I bought this base for an older Craftsman table saw. The base seems to work well. It was easy to assemble. The only minor negative is the threads on the wheels could be 1"" longer. The lack of the extra height lets everything move when ripping 4'x8' stock. Price was reasonable."
5,Good product. Work as expected.,"Got it from Amazon for $35.99 (with 20% off on top of Friday sales price) for my work bench in the garage.Pro:1. Low profile. Does not add too much hight to my work bench.2. Easy to operate.3. Sturdy and flexible for resizing.Con:Not major flaw. Just to be a little picky. The manual is not fool-proof and some people will sure get lost at the very beginning. Just to read the manual couple of times and you will know what it is talking about.During installation, do not tighten up all nuts till you have successfully placed your equipment on this universal base. The fitting may take 1 or 2 trial-and-error.In all, I am very happy with this product. Now I can move my work bench easily in my garage. Even thought reading the manual takes some efforts, I still give this product the whole credit."
4,HTC Mobile base,"I have bought two of these bases, and am quite satisfied with them. I'm using one under a 16 inch bandsaw, and the other under a 1 1/2 HP jet shaper. Particularly good is the lifting mechanism, using two lifts rather than the competion's one. Two enable You to let the tool back down after moving quite gently with no jarring crash to the floor. Assembly instructions are clear, and I had no difficulty following them. I would buy this product again."
4,Mobile base,This product works very well. I was impressed on how easy it moves the load I put on it. I have had similar mobile bases in the past but this one works much better
4,Works well . . . but . . .,"Works well - just installed it on my bandsaw . . . Only one complaint . . . The instructions were abysmal . . . But, being the kind of guy I am, [one just like you, Buddy], I rarely look at the directions anyhow . . ."
4,Midwest Do-It-Yourselfer,"This product works as promimsed. There are a few minor issues as documented in other reviews, however for the average do-it-yourselfer that doesn't do woodworking for a living this is a good tool at a good value. Assembly is very easy. I have my model 2000 base set up for my radial arm saw and it has worked flawlessly and moves the 200+ lb saw around with ease. I have the 1000 model for my 10"" benchtop saw and have found it to be a good item also. For those Craftsman lovers out there, Sears sells this exact tool (Model 2000) for $30 more (with the Craftsman logo on it, of course)."
4,HTC2000 Mobile Base,"I own two of these mobile bases. One moves a 10"" Jet Contractor Saw around the workshop (the garage)and the other is used with a Jet 14"" Bandsaw. These bases are easy to assemble and allow for easy lifting to move the equipment around your shop. I am planning on getting another on to make my thickness planer mobile. This is a good product for a good price."
1,Hurts the hands be ready to replace the rope,"The disc portion itself is very durable, but the rope is so rough for little hands and some of the children in our area that tried this out could not balance themselves on it and went back to their ""old fashioned"" swing.Overall if I had to choose to purchase this or an ""old fashioned"" swing, the old fashioned swing wins hands down."
4,"Good, cheap fun","For the price we paid, this swing has been a big hit for my 6 year old daughter. We hung it on the tree out back. She likes to stand on a stool and swing off of it. She can get pretty high up. My 2 year old can't hold herself up on it, so I have to help her. They have not had the problem of getting their hair tangled in it at all. I can't see how they would get it tangled. It is the perfect swing for a sturdy tree where a regular swing would not work. It was also very easy to hang up over the branch. Overall, I am glad I bought it. The kids love it."
2,Tie back Children's hair!,"My daughter had fun with this until her hair became entangled in the rope. It took me a very long time to free her hair from being twisted up in the rope and I eventually had to cut the rope to get her loose. I would recommend if you buy this to go to the hardware store and buy a better rope and not one that is almost like plastic like this one is. Please make sure your kid's hair, no matter how long it is, is pulled back securely!"
3,May not be for your small child,"I bought this for my 5 and 3 year old, and they sit on it and swing. But, even though they sit on it correctly with their feet crossed, holding on tight, they flip upside down or go horizontal while swinging. They laugh for a few seconds and then want to stop because they know they will soon be hitting the ground. My husband and I both got on it briefly, and neither one of us flipped around but swung vertically. We figure the girls have trouble with it because they are both on the petite side in height and weight. I think they are just too small for it. Needs to be for an older child or bigger 5 year old. Just doesn't seem to work for kids under 5."
5,what's going on?,"after hearing gord downie lament about the Rheo's on Live Between Us....""thanks to the Rheostatics, we are much richer for having seen them tonite"" ...I figured I would give one of their CD'S a shot....tracks 1,2,3,9,13,17 are sublime.... and Shaved Head moved me in a way that only a handful of rock/alternative song have ... I played it seven or eight times before moving on to the rest...agree with the other opine...Guns could have stayed on the cutting room floor...the music gets stronger with each listen"
2,Time paradox,Was hoping for a continuation of the original story. A very forgettable sequel. I can live without another time paradox.
1,A Waste of Time,"I've always loved H.G. Wells' ""Time Machine"" and was really excited when I found this book. I managed to get about halfway through it before I finally decided why bother reading anymore. The narrator spends most of his time questioning and whining over just about everything and the plot becomes unmercifully confusing and complicated. I found myslf struggling through a book whose main character I could no longer stand. Save your money, take a pass on this one."
3,3rd in a Series,"Yes, indeed, Prince of Time is 3rd in a series of novels that begins with The Chalice and the Blade, and continues wth Dream Stone. Reading the Prince of Time without reading the other two novels would be like wading through mud. McReynolds is very good at characterizations--even for minor characters. Her plotting is a bit loose-feeling mid-text, but comes together. Vocabulary, for those who have already got limited abilities, or who have no familiarity with Gaelic/Welsh/Old English/Norse will be daunting. (Skraeling? Jacinth? Weir?) If you commonly read very simple romances, skip these; if you sometimes read fantasy or science fiction, as well as romance you might very well like this series. I normally refuse to finish poorly-written books, but I read all 3 of these, so perhaps that's a good review in itself!"
1,Save your money and time. A cereal box is more interesting.,"I haven't read a book this bad in 10 years. The writer is more in love were here own meanderings than she is with the plot. The suppossed romance is a farce but so is every character the writer tries to create. It is books like these that make you wish publishers offered a money back guarantee. I simply can't imagine how this thing got to print and those people who rated this book 5 stars, must be pseudonyms or friends of the author (but I can't even see a friend risking their neck on approving this garbage)."
4,Tamron 200-500 Rocks,I have had this lens for about a month now and wanted to test it out. Packed up and went to the local zoo. Focus was fast and on point. The lens proformed great and the pictures came out sharp. I print out three of the picture and should them to my friends. They were taken back with the quality of this lens. They were all saying before this Nikon or Canon prime lens is the was to go. Now they are saying I want a Tamron 200-500 too.
3,Good! But not her best,"I found this book very interesting at the beginning, full of mystery, romance, sadness,revenge and tragedies. But towards the end the story line became a bit boring"
1,"Not a film book, be warned","I know this text fairly well. I went to film school, and Joe Anderson was the head of the film deparment. I took his cognitive film theory class, and his own book, this book, was the text.This book will teach you nothing about film. It is a psychology book. It is moderately interesting to consider how the brain works to perceive the illusion of strobing still images and sound, bonding it together into a ""moving"" image on the screen. But this will not teach you anything about making film, video, or TV.So, if you really like film theory, but don't like film, then this book is for you. If you want to be a better filmmaker then run, run away.By the way, I got an incomplete in his class. But he left the university after that semester."
4,"Good Value, Good Product","The difference between this fence and a Sear's standard contractor's saw fence is like day and night. This fence is solid, moves easily, and you don't have to worry about it not being parallel to the blade or budging with use. Life before adding this fence was the opposite, frustrating with a lot of time and wood wasting. Installation is relatively easy . . . well under an hour. I studied the more expensive options before purchase and am happy I made the decision that this product delivered equal value and quality for significantly less money. One negative. It was delivered without installation instructions or any documentation and getting instructions faxed from the manufacturer took over a week."
5,Great track.,"This set is a lot of fun for both of my boys, my husband and I to play with. It took me 5-10mins to put together and then we played with it the rest of the day. It's very easy for both of my boys ages 3 and 2 to use and they have no problem getting the cars going on the track. They can get two cars going around at the same time. The set only comes with one car so we had to find one of our other cars to use and it did take going through a couple to find one that worked well.I do agree with the previous reviewer, the batteries are way to easy to access. The door to the battery compartment just pops off and you access it from the top of the toy not the bottom."
2,Not very durable,The track needs to be taped to the floor in order to work and did not really keep our chldrens interest since the car simply goes around the track by itself as you simply watch it. Not very interactive at all. The kids now proceed to try to beat each other up with the parts instead of playing with it.
1,Hot Wheel case that carries 100 cars,"The 100 car carrying case is a piece of junk, who do you complain to so it can be taken care of, I would like to ship it to someone and have them refund me, so I can get my grandson the 48 carry case, that is much durable, JUNK is the 100 case. So please don't buy it. Does someone know who I can talk to."
1,A static bore,"The story did not have enough scene shift relief in its screen adaptation (it was a one set play). When there are essentially only two characters in a screenplay there should be some diversion of scenery from time to time which is why one is captivated by a film like ""Sunset Boulevard"" which is fundamentally a two person drama. However, Gloria Swanson and William Holden are afforded shifts of scenes away from the mansion where most of the action takes place so that the viewer does not feel ""imprisoned"". Also, neither of the two actors possess the allure of Swanson and Holden, nor does this insipid story pack the punch of that of screenwriter/director Billy Wilder."
4,a real sleeper!,I rented this film knowing nothing about the storyline or actors.Boy was I surprised! The story and action keep you glued to thescreen. Characters and story are real and move you regardless of tthe content. They are amazingly believable..after all that's what acting is all about.
2,lost tone within 3 weeks,"i prefer the remo heads , i dunno why this head turned for the worst . i take care of my set"
5,Long lasting - best pen we've used,"We used this for 1.5 years writing our weekly grocery list. Eraser tip was useful, pen had a good flow and the thin tip was easy to read. Our favorite pen over other Expo pens which dried out and other markers which smell (this is low odor)."
2,boring...,I love Ani! I began listening to her back in college and the first album I bought was her first one (self-titled). I had since bought most things working from her oldnest to newest. Recent years have found me less angry and I'd moved away only to see Evolve the other day and thought 'hey how about a new Ani album'... this one sucks! I keep skipping all the tracks. It compares not all with her wonderful early years. Granted it has lost the annoying pop quality of UP UP UP UP... but it sucks compared to Dilate and Living in Clip etc.
4,Evolving pleasure,"I initially wrote a tepid review. I take it back. This is not tepid, but mixed. It's like going back to an old lover and finding that their body doesn't fit you quite the same way. Not bad, just different. It took a while for this album to grow on me. I'm a dedicated folkie, and the jazz riffs left me a little cold. Her lyrics are still incisive, but where they used to give me goosebumps, now they just strike me- 'oh, that was a good line...' She is still an amazing wordsmith. But I felt that the new sound left precious little room for that primal voice of hers to get the real point across.That said, I respect her defiant transformation as an artist. Art has to evolve, and repeating one's past success only leads to staleness. This CD may not have had the visceral impact on me that her others have, but I am eager to see what comes next from someone that I can only characterize as a tsunamic artist."
5,Beauty That Moves...,"I won every solo Ani Difranco c.d., including her collaborations and every other artist on her label. Not that this gives me any authority, only insight. We know she's an amazing song writer, a profound poet, and a deeply intellectual being, but this album leaves me speechless. I find it to be her most mature and deeply moving innovation since Not A Pretty Girl, and maybe Castles. While she has been EVOLVING through all of her c.d.'s, for better or worse, it seems to me, that with this particular release, she is perhaps finally, THE most prolific artist of our time. If her evolution were to cease here, and all her c.d.'s managed to capture the beauty of this one, I would be quite content."
3,At least she's consistent.....,"As is the case with most Ani albums in my opinion she's got a couple jems on there and that's about it. This album didn't even have many gems the one song that stood out (And really held it's ground.) Was the song Evolve itself. That tunes was almost worth the $18, and there are a couple other tunes that aren't bad but then the rest of it as is the case with all of her other albums is kinda bland."
2,pretty Average,"I've listened to Her Stuff for Years&the Last Album that I thought that was Alright was ""Little Plastic Castles"".but after that Hit&alot of Miss.""Up,Up,Up,Up,"" was the turning point where for me She became just kinda there&I think with the Changes in her Band&also with trying to add more to Her Style&Sound She lost some of Her Early Edge&Drive.this Album has some interesting moments but not enough when compared to Her Earlier Stuff in her Career."
2,im lost,"a fan of both alanis morissette and tori amos, everyone told me to check out ani. so i did. i respected her lyrics and motivation behind her songs, but the music never did anything for me. i decided to purchase ""evolve"". i gave it a good listen. and i just couldn't find how she's such a legend already. she's good but not that good. i'm not really one to judge as someone so unfamiliar with her material and style, so maybe i should give it a few more listens. but i know good music when i hear it, and there's nothing spectacular here. then again, i grew to like bjork, someone i hated at first. so i may end up an ani fan sometime soon. i know this wasn't much help, but basically...i can only say that if you're looking for music that catches the ear, it's not available here."
5,Wore out the tape and had to buy the CD......,"What can I say? A friend gave me a tape of both Turf and Riverside. The tape has worn to warp stage and I just can't go another day without replacing this music. These songs won't wear out like a cassette will, so do yourself a favor and buy the CD in the first place! Everything about the artist exudes REAL and this release once again proves his depth. In his heart warming voice, Luka poignantly paints another lyrical masterpiece. A must have for anyone who ""feels"" music. Bloom On!"
1,Ultralast UL-1216 Battery,"The shipment arrived quickly, but that's the only good thing I can say about it. The packaging was for the UL, but the battery had been replaced with a standard one. Not only was it not the correct battery, it was also dead on arrival. It was a totally disappointing experience."
4,one o earl klghs favorites,"even though this is not one of the most popular pieces by the master,as he has said at more than one of earls live concerts,its one of the most underrated.when you listen to big turtle river for the first time,it will make you feel so good you will listen to it over and over again.i also like.night walk.both fast paced toe tapping tracks.as always i love his ballads best,but this shows his versatility.a must buy"
3,Lots of Questions!,"If you want lots of questions to practice with than you will love having this, however wrong and right answers are not explained. I used the study cards more often and the online practice questions were of more use."
3,Get the newer version.,"If this was the most recent version I would probably have rated it differently but just spend the extra bucks and get the 5th edition. A lot of questions on this review book cover areas that are no longer tested on and no explanations are given for the answers chosen. This is nothing like the ASCP Board exam. This basically tests your knowledge and the Board exam is more of a ""What would you do next basis?"""
2,Catherine Parr on the cover of a book about Jane Grey?,"A book with Catherine Parr on the cover using a few embellished facts, very little research and fanciful story telling make this a book only for the passive reader."
2,"Glorious Vine, Glorious Color","Wine grapes and wine-making are splendid subjects for the photographer, full of colors and textures, people and things that seem to cry out for sensitive treatment. Most wine books are devoted to text, but not this one. It's almost all pictures, and very handsome ones at that. Large in format and well printed, this is a companion book to ""Cabernet,"" by the same photographer. (See my review of that book for more details.)--Bill Marsano"
3,Simulteneously solves all characters' problems,"I found it interesting how the author pulled together all the characters and simulteneously solved all their problems.I am, however, confused why the author chose to present Michael as a convicted murder, released from prison only after a few years sentense. Not only was he a convicted murder, but was at a point where he might have easily killed his wife and daughter. Yet, 3 women in the story, including his wife, forgave him for this crime. I could not follow how they justified this."
1,Making Kumihimo japanese interlaced brads,Darn I should have read the other reviews. I looked at the pictures and thought I could do them on one of my looms - but no it's for a way more complicated loom. Rats I should have not bought this since I am a complete novice!
4,M's review,"very informative book, but no real information on how to find supplies. This is a very techinical book which reads fluently with step by step instructions. I highly recomend although you may need other references to compete your project."
4,BEGINNER BASICS,"This book is good for anyone who has interest in the topic but is not familiar with it. Pretty Short, but in general a good book. Very interesting although you may need more sources to start on growing mushrooms."
4,Fun Toy,"We bought this for our twin boys for Christmas. They were one and a half yrs old. They do like it and sit on it a lot, but really are already too big to rock on it. They like to pretend to be driving it instead. So, I do recommend it because they are very fond of it, but wish we had bought it for them when they were closer to one year old and would get more use out of it. At about 30 lbs they have pretty much outgrown it and we are getting them 10 inch bike for their second birthday."
5,Very loud!,"My step son got this for his first Christmas in 2002 and he LOVES IT! It has held up very well and when he has it out its all he'll play with. We have had many tantrums when we have to take him off to eat or change his diaper because he loves it so much. He prefers it on carpet because the way he gets on and off he slides it in all different directions and he winds up doing the splits most of the time and isnt happy. I, however, highly recommend buying a bottle of Advil BEFORE you let your child play with it because it is very loud and it gets very annoying after a while. Ours ""lost"" its batteries. Maybe ear plugs to go along with the Advil too. It's a fun toy for kids and teaches them how to sit in a way that is different for them and it's a cause and effect toy too. All in all, great for kids, bad for parents heads."
3,Fun toy but sound dies after 3 months,"My little girl received this toy as a gift for her first birthday. She absolutely loves it!!!! She plays with it all the time. However, after three months the sound quit working. I had the cycle replaced, and again after 2-3 months the sound quit working again - with the exact same symptoms. The lights go off, but no sound. AND YES, we replaced the batteries - multiple times. It does have a year warranty, but what's the point if I have to keep replacing it every 2-3 months. It is just not the same without the sound......"
5,SO MUCH FUN,My parents and my sister and I have game night on Thursday nights. It is our favorite game to play. We get to learn more about each other and it's a lot of fun. We gave Chatter Matters to my best friend's family and they play it too.
4,Going Back to the 60's,"For a long time, I was hoping to obtain a CD copy of Hugo's version of Ennio's western music that would also include as a bonus, Hugo's rendition of ""Hang 'em High"". This is it, and as I though, the CD recording is excellent. The rest of the album music is rather average, but it does bring back fond memories of several TV programs (and films), from the 60's."
2,Buen diseño,"Es una herramienta util y con un buen diseño, pero es demasiado fragil, de no utilizarse correctamente y con el tiempo se rompe el recubrimiento."
3,Less info than previous (2002) edition for important works,"I have the previous full (2002) edition and it is great.But in this new edition, for many of the key works they seem to cover a lot less of the important recordings than they did in the 2002 edition! Not sure why: do they have many new recordings pushing out old (better) recordings, or are they adding more composers, or is it something else???Also, I agree with the other reviewers on the British recordings bias; they waste so much space waffling on about these when the space could be spent on other recordings.Anyway, if you have the 2002 edition, you will not gain a lot from this new edition, and you will have to look back at the 2002 edition to find out more info for very many works..."
1,practically useless but huge,"I have a huge classical CD collection and hoped this would help in my decision making for new purchases. The book is huge, and useless. Such a weird bias in the reviews, EXTREMELY shallow reviews at that and even the 2004 issue is badly out of date. The print is so small it is hardly legible. I guess the solution is an online source that can be deeper, wider and up to date. I'll use it for a door-stop, so it's not an entire loss."
5,Vertical Intercourse,"This is the best book by Paul Reed so far. I was truly blown away by the humanity, insight, and pure honesty of the characters and their lives. Rarely does a book in the ""gay"" genre delve into themes of aging in the community, or looks-ism, or the uncertainty of dating and all the pleasures and conflicts that brings. But not only are the characters intriguing, their stories are fascinating, and we can't wait to turn the page to see what happens next. Beyond this, the writing is exquisite. Reed is known already for his elegant prose, but in Vertical Intercourse, he has managed to grow beyond the elegiac poetry of his novel Longing and achieve something stylistically polished but that reads like a breeze, effortless. I don't know how he does it. This book should be a permanent part of every gay man's library. I can't recommend it highly enough."
4,Last of the True Good Recordings,Fresh and honest sounding. Its hard to believe Chrissie Hynde's band seem to be in disarray. I think she is the only original memeber left and there are about three different drummers on this record. None the less the songs and beautiful and performed very professionally. The cover of Forever Young is just lovely with the special effects augmenting the sound very nicely. Hollywood Perfume and Night In My Veins are probably the two best originals although the others hold their own.
3,Christmas gift,I gave this cookbook to my 9 yr old daughter for Christmas. She has loved it and is lookinig forward to making some of the recipes in here.
5,Worth the investment,"It did not take long to discover that the cookies, macaroni and pretzel mixes included with my son's Real Meal oven were a huge disappointment in terms of portion size and taste. We were glad my son also received Kristen Joyal's cookbook, because it has enabled us to make delicious and simple recipes. I especially appreciated the option of making baking mixes that can be stored and used later as needed! I would definitely recommend buying this cookbook instead of more Real Meal or Easy Bake food mixes."
5,This book should arrive with your Easy Bake Oven,"After purchasing my first mix for my son's Easy Bake Oven, I knew there had to be a better, and less expensive, way. This book has some excellent recipes in it - things I am happy to make and eat with my son. The half-dozen we have tried so far have been consistently good. Further, it allows my son to actually cook, instead of just adding water. I have to help a little more with things, since there are more ingredients and more steps, but the results are satisfying for both of us. And best of all - the desserts and snacks are portion controlled."
3,Driving Lessons,"This is a very good film about a relationship between a young man and an older woman. It is not a romance, but the two share some great moments. Rupert Grint and Julie Walters fans will enjoy this one!"
3,"different, but not boring","Julie Walters was remarkable in this semi-decent movie that blundered about at times, but was overall quite interesting to watch. And this movie proves that Rupert Grint can, in fact, act."
3,Driving Miss Evie...,"Learning to do anything is difficult, particularly if your Mom is your teacher. In this case, Ben (Grint) has a serious problem because his Mom (Linney) mostly wants him to take her over to see her new boyfriend. The only break this poor kid gets is when aging actress, Evie (Walters) hires him as a general helper.I love British comedy and got this movie thinking it was more of the same, but there's a lot of bitter reality served up with the laughs. Grint does a good job growing up and getting away from his Ron Weasley role in this coming of age film. Ms. Walters is amazing as always as Evie--and she does her own coming of second age in this drama. ""Driving Lessons"" is an interesting drama is just not as much escape humor as I would have hoped for."
1,Not international enough,"I could not obtain a subscription to Australia via this Amazon site. Funny, I had a subscription I initated many years ago but had overlooked renew last year, the magazine was promptly delivered to my door in Australia for over 4 years!!Vogue Intenational indeed! What does International mean to Vogue?"
1,THIS THING SUCKS,It sucks just about NO POWER! I really want my money back! As soon as I got I was frustrated and put back in the box in storage closest. Don't waste your money!
1,Weak and barely works,"Dont waste time with this vibrator..it doesnt hardly work, It is nice quality, just too slow and useless. Dont buy"
5,Enjoyed the ride,I felt like I was on the road with the author as I was reading. At times I did not want to put the book down and I wanted to see what was going to happen next on his adventure. His interpretation of some of the places in small town Pennsylvania and in the south were very thought provoking.
3,Drina Freak,"I consider myself an expert on the entire Drina series and can say with confidence that this is not the best in the series. It is, however, a solid performer. The main problem is that it suffers from being set in an entirely different location and lacking in the usual cast of characters, particularly Drina's grandparents.It is interesting to read others' reviews of the Drina books beacause there is so much confusion over the titles and which book is which. I'm also intrigued that no-one has mentioned the later books including the final book, ""Drina Ballerina"" which was only written in about 1990.I first read a Drina book in the 1970s, in coloured hardback editions. At that time only the first six books were available. Since then I have discovered Drina Dances in Paris, Switzerland, Madeira, Drina goes on Tour, and finally, Drina Ballerina, set in contemporary England and with considerable changes to the characters, particularly Rose..."
4,32 oz tote,"Built NY 32-Ounce Bottle Tote - Dot No. 7This is the 3rd Built NY 32-oz tote I've purchased. I love them. I freeze about 2/3 of a bottle of filtered water, fill them with water, then put the bottle in the tote. This way, they keep the water cold a lot longer than the 3-4 hours guaranteed by the manufacturer.I only gave this one a 4-star rating, however, because the 'dot' design is pretty dull-looking. I prefer the brilliantly-colored solid totes.The company's delivery was excellent. I received the tote in less than a week."
1,poor customer service,"I have not been very impressed with this fence's durability. In order to lock the fence you must drop the fence bar, which in turn compresses a brass spring on the rail. Well, this spring unsurprisingly snapped, clearly from metal fatigue, in less than two years of regular use. Trying to get a new spring from Vega has been a challenge, 3 weeks and waiting. I can deal with unpleasant customer service from a company that will deliver but this experience has been discouraging.If you are considering this ""pro"" model for a production shop, I'd recommend you consider other brands."
4,Vega pro 50 table saw fence,"I am very happy with the fence. I put it on a 12"" older craftman saw . I had to drill some of the holes on the back but it worked out very well. after setting it up I am happy with it."
1,What a total nightmare,"Don't know what I missed listening to this concert.I love Opera but this is a nightmare of singing ,if you can call that singing,there are very few moments that are ""Great"".Dessay is a total mess ,she screamed and shrieked her way through the aria,even Damrau is in poor voice,usually a singer I admire.The whole lot are not worth the price of the DVD.If you like great singing ,save you're money and buy the many ""Galas"" that are available ,skip this one.I bought the DVD on the recomandation of the three reviews,what a mistake,they are just like the audience in vienna,who would have given the artists an ovation,for being mostly terrible,yes there were a few arias sung OK but most of them had a hard time and sounded way past there prime.Will Domingo EVER stop singing?"
2,demse,same old story with a new wrapper. the last couple of pages told the whole story. waste of time
4,Demise of the Dollar,I received the book in excellent condition and in a timely manner. Thanks Richard M.
3,Dollar Dangers Explained,"The author follows through on only half of his book's title. He gives us an exceptionally clear explanation of why the the dollar is in trouble--massive trade deficits, outrageous federal budgets, and short-sighted interest-rate manipulations by the Fed. He explains why having gone off a standard of value, such as gold, has encouraged governments to print money at whim. He repeats this litaney from chapter to chapter--not stylish, but very convincing. However, his chapter on investment opportunities was disappointing. Most people who would be thinking of buying the book probably already know about gold markets and foreign currencies."
5,Your wallet wants you to buy this book,"This book is straightforward and easy-to-read. It tells it like it is: what will happen with the dollar, why it is happening, and how to capitalize on it.Some of it can be a sobering wake-up-call, but overall, this is a book that cannot be missed. I'm a financial advisor, and whenever one of my clients asks me about the ""Demise of the Dollar,"" I direct them towards Wiggin's book. It's a fine read--quick and informative. Don't hesitate to pick it up."
4,pretest emt basic self assessment and review,my friends and I found this book very helpful in our studies.. it showed us our weaknesses and what we needed to really review and our strengths... it is a very good book if you are going to take the emt basic class and the national registry exam.
5,Fantastic!,"I love these! It took me some time to get used to holding them, because they are huge. I knitted scarves for Christmas gifts using these needles. I did a straight knit using two different colors of super bulky yarn and the loos pattern turned out beautifully. I am a new knitter and a scarf took me about an hour. I would definitely use super bulky yarn, though, otherwise, the knit it is too loose and the strands catch very easily and warp what you are making."
4,Amazon Summary is Wrong,It would help if Amazon summarized the book correctly. The TV producer is female. The book is much better than the summary.
3,The Name of the Game,I am an avid fan of Nora Roberts' writings This is not the most exciting book Nora Roberts has written.
2,DVD not anamorphic,Buyer beware: the DVD is not anamorphic widescreen. Shame on Koch Lorber for such a shoddy transfer.
2,Not what I expected,"I picked up this album in a big box store. I had been looking for a good compilation album of some of ELP's hits, and this looked like it would do. Unfortunately, nowhere on the box does it say that it's a live album. I wouldn't have bought it if it had been labeled as such. Frankly I find some songs absulutely butchered by the long solo sequences, and the audience singing along in other songs just ruins the whole set for me."
3,for serious fans only,"I was very excited when I picked up this ELP gold collection. On first listen, however, the first track is of very poor sound quality. However, the rest of the two cd's sound quality range from fair to pretty good. Greg Lake's voice is strong throughout, and Emerson's keyboard is as spacey as ever. Overall, with the sheer amount of matierial, and low price, I would recomend this cd to progressive rock fans."
4,Science of Discworld II: The Globe,"This is difficult, as I am one of the authors! In my view, this is the best of the (first...) three Science of Discworld books. Pan narrans is a lovely idea!"
4,Not bad,My only complaint is they leave black marks on my seats from the car seats being on them for so long. Haven't tried to clean the seats yet.
4,Good product,"Good Product, could be slighly wider for seats in Yukon XL, over all made well, does not smell and stays in place. Would recommend."
5,"good price, great product","I went online and retail stores to check up different brands of seat protectors, and found this product worked the best for me. It's light weight and provides more coverage. It is not as thick as Prince Lionheart one but thick enough to protect my leather seat from any kind of dent or mark. It's water prove and does absorb a little water. I only hand wash it once and it looks pretty okay. I don't think I would ever thorw it in a washing machine though. Good product."
2,Niner towel,"The colors and graphics are great. But the towel is very small and thin. Not great for holding a lot of water. I definately wouldn't call it a bath or beach towel......maybe for my 5 yo, but not for an adult."
3,monster,I remember hearing this story on the news. But the book is slow and hard to read. Soooo many details and names of ppl to try and keep up with. I know its the details that put this monster in jail. I admire the detective that finally caught him for being so dedicated.
4,some good ideas,"I purchased this book for my wife and I in order to get some ideas about anniversary celebrations. There are some good ideas (though I really think many of the party ideas are way too 'hokey').The gift ideas for the various anniversaries are good (and easier for me to find than sifting through a bunch of internet sites trying to sell items when you perform an 'anniversary gift' search). I also like the book as a quick reference for 'what anniversary gift options go with what anniversary'...wood, iron, rock, paper, scissors, etc). The book does a nice job of describing the 'traditional' vs. 'modern' gift selections with some nice suggestions. I reference the book a few times a year for various reasons...overall pleased with the purchase."
2,I hate Phil Collins...,"... for making this an Eric Clapton album where the Guitarman himself has been reduced to a mere session player - and not a well used one at that. There is no serious guitar on this record, just eighties synths and, of course, drums. The only decent song is Holy Mother (instant classic about one of Clapton's friends who gave up on life and committed suicide), where Phil Collins had the common sense to back off and leave it to Clapton. That song is the reason for two stars, but it is not enough to save the entire album from the deadly grasp of a highly overrated producer - Phil Collins. He should be severely punished for what he has done to this album."
2,Clapton at his lowest,"I recently gave this one another listen and it still disappoints me. Eric was lost for directions at this time and it shows in this recording. He says it clearly in ""Holy Mother"" which is one of the very few high points on this album. I do like ""Tearing us apart"" but even that energetic song doesn't age well in time. Thank God he found his path again with the wonderful ""Journeyman"" cd later on but this one reflects a very uncreative stage of his marvelous career. Skip it."
3,worth buying for one song...,"Any Clapton fan should own this album, if not for a few good songs here and there, then for ""It's in the way that you use it"" alone. Once you get past the keyboards, listen to the guitar solo on this track- if you like blues at all, it will truly speak to you."
1,Probably Clapton's Worst,"Most of this sounds like a Phil collins album but without the energy or the wit. Collins has put out some interesting material, and some bland material. This Clapton album is right up there with the worst of Collins. This was such a disappointment, coming right after ""Behind the Sun"" where Clapton had returned to form. There is nothing wrong with experimenting with new styles or pop music. It's just this style is ill suited for Clapton's talents and most of these songs are just bad pop. There are alot of significant guest stars on this album, but they really don't contribute anything.The album does start out with Tearin' Us Apart, which is an excellent duet with Tina Turner. But that just makes this an expensive single. For the B-side there is It's In the Way That You Use It, but I always found this song annoying with its bombastic intro and chorus."
1,MISSING NICE CASE,"In the picture they show that it comes with a ""beautifully-packaged laquered gift box"". NO IT DOESN'T!!! We ordered it and it came with a box, a regular carboard box! We were going to give it out to clients. No way, we returned it. We wanted the nice box - false advertising!"
4,"Fits perfectly, nice quality","The drawer insert is strong and holds all of my silverware and some other utensils as well. You need to remember what you put in the back slots because you can't see them very well when you open the drawer(unless you move it all the way to the front). However, the shorter pieces-teaspoons, salad forks, soup spoons, fit very well there. My drawer is deep enough that there is some extra space in front of it to use some other frequently used utensils. A good purchase!"
5,A chronicle of continuing encroachments on Indian country,"Matthiessen is a methodical, although not disinterested, reporter of how the destruction of Native American culture was and continues to be attended by encroachments by and desecrations of their land (what little they've been left) by a society gone mad with greed.And how could anyone, journalist or not, remain disinterested in the face of such things? More journalists and writers should have Matthiessen's courage and conviction."
4,Worth what I paid. Okay router.,"Don't confuse this kind of Hitachi with the real heavy-duty kind of Hitachi and you will be allright. Some of the trim fell off right out of the box!But cosmetic issues aside, the router has worked great the month or 2 I've had it. It resides in a router table, so I don't even see it.One mistake I made was to tighten the 1/4"" collet withotu a bit in it. The collet came apart, and was not easy to reassemble. It is a really tight fit now, but that's really my fault, not Hitachi's."
4,The Fix It Guy,"Delivery was prompt and arrived in good condition. Good Quality Materials, good stitching. Easy to deploy once youre familiar with it. A bit pricey though, would have rated with five stars but for the price."
1,Whack !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie was'nt even worth the postage...A few scene with some tight Sistas is the only reason I did'nt throw it out of the window !!!!
3,Could be better,"The 3 spinning attachments are the best part of this product, however you cannot push too hard on them or they won't work, so you strain your legs to hold your feet up. The jets are nice but the bubbles are pretty weak and the heat maintence is marginal at best."
1,Terrible,"I purchased this in the store, wish I had read the Amazon reviews like I normally do. I put 2 towels under it since I was using it on carpet. Filled it up, turned it on, and it was all downhill from there. The bubbles never came on, the spinning features were weak and useless, finally turned it off and just soaked...then suddenly my feet felt cold, so I looked down and all the water was gone. And seeping through the towels into my carpet. It leaked from the bottom and all the water ended up on the carpet. This is the worst product of this type I have ever bought, I will be returning it immediately. Very dissapointed."
5,Wonderful story!,This is a second world war story of the Catholic church and it's participation in protecting Jewish refugees. The setting is Assisi and our hero is a Franciscan friar. Not all WWII Germans were bad. In Assisi we find an officer who was a devout Catholic. He protected the friar from one Nazi in particular. Heart warming and beautiful. I love this movie.
2,Great Sound - Extremely Poor Packaging,I bought this remastered version to replace my original copy that I have had since it came out. It's a great CD and I have played it many times over. You have to ignore the reviews that bash it because they are trying to compare the music to Led Zeppelin. Of course it sounds like Led Zeppelin. That's where the influence comes from. Is the music as good as Led Zeppelin? Of course not. But it is awesome music from a band that rocked. My big hang up with this new remastered release is the poor packaging. They didn't only screw up the track order but they were sloppy about sticking with all capital letters versus mixed case track titles. The rest of the packaging is about as bland as can be. There are no album credits or liner notes anywhere. Doesn't even list the members of the band anywhere or say who produced it. Looks like I will be keeping my original copy and trading in this new unprofessionally packaged remaster.
3,Great but need more options...,Great product if you want to connect your iPhone in your car system. I don't like the remote controller because you can't look through the iPhone's songs with it.
2,Developing .NET Custom Controls,"This book is full of typos and is not well structured. In the few chapters which were well written, I usually found that the material in the chapter merely whetted my appetite for more actual details (as opposed to more enumeration of properties and methods).On the other hand, I haven't seen _any_ other book attempt to tackle advanced design-time issues like this book does, and it's nice to see the similarities between Windows Forms and Web Forms designers."
2,False Advertisement,"Do not buy this, it is not as advertised (Sold by Audio Connections). 4 wires were missing. Buy Scosche VW03B instead, all wires included. Only good thing is that I received a refund."
5,Christian Dalits in India,Anyone interested in Indian dalits (ex-untouchables) and Christian conversion must read this amazing book.
4,Adequate Resource,"This text is great for basic information, but isn't practical if you are pursuing neuroscience. While it goes over a wide range of topics, it never goes in depth.If you have a lot of questions, you may want to consider a more advanced neural science text book."
2,It [stinks],"It was required by many of our introductory neuroscience classes. But the fact remains it is a comprehensive introductory text that deals very little with the actual physiology. It may be useful for psychologists or other non ""hard-core"" neuroscientists, but for physiologists, especially those trained in molecular biology or biophysics, I would not recommend this book since it does not present any topic to a significant depth, thus most of the time lacks insights. I recommend Shepards book on Neurobiology as an introduction for neurobiology and Johnston and Wu for a more in depth introduction to the physiology of the nervous system."
3,Lacks flanges,"We bought this lid for our Lodge deep fryer DFK2A and skillet 5SK2. Unfortunately this lid doesn't completely cover the two pouring spouts on the sides of both the skillet and fryer. The gaps let some of the steam escape during cooking, reducing its self basting, moisture and heat retention properties. And during storage, the gap is large enough to allow bugs to crawl into the pan. When we are camping, we still need to put foil over the pan, partially defeating the purpose of the lid. If this lid had flanges, like the 9 inch lid, we would have given it 5 stars."
3,Disappointing,"I thought that Rain was very disapointing. I've been waiting for another book by this auther for ever and this one made me feel as though I shouldn't have bought it. It was an okay book, but I definately wouldn't buy the 2nd. (Although I might borrow it from someone first.)"
1,what?,"It shouldn't be so much like Dawn. Come on! This is a NEWbook... why rehash an old plot? the fill-in-the blank plots writtenin some of the other review is true for each and every v. c. andrews book; it was good w/ Flowers, Heaven, and Dawn, but how much longer can it go on with people still being interested? Aren't you tired of reading the same book over and over again? END"
4,"Dawn, I mean Rain was a great book","Well, this was a great book. Although I wish she would change the plot a bit. I thought it was VERY predictable. But I love her writting style and will read all her books. I did like the fact that there was actualy a nice grandmother for once. Just a hint if you loved Dawn, you'll love Rain."
2,what was the point?,Okay I thought I would like this book but I really didn't! There is no way I would read this book again! My english teacher was right and I tried to tell her that I would like it but sure enough I thought it was DUMB! I wasted my time with this book and to tell you the truth I couldn't even finish it! I don't read much but when I do read i want a book that's going to grab my attention and this book absolutly did not! I wish i could say differently but I can't
3,You Can't Stop the Rain,"I enjoyed reading Rain, and I am looking forward to the next installment in the Arnold series. However, the ""rags to riches"" theme is a bit played out. This story reads like so many of the other books: Dawn, Ruby, etc. I am a V.C. Andrews fan, but the ""ghostwriter"" needs to work on a less predictable plot line next time. I also find it hard to believe that Rain ONLY listens to Classical music! I mean, come on! What teenager or young adult do you know that ONLY listens to classical music? I'm not knocking classical music, but this is a bit unrealistic! Why does the story HAVE to take place in the ghetto/projects? Not all black people come from the 'hood. I hope in Lightning Strikes Rain adds some variety to her musical tastes! And what is up with her mother (not Latisha)?"
4,V.C. Andrews does It AGAIN!,"I found this book very intriguing. I put this book up there with Sister Souljah's THE COLDEST WINTER EVER (5 stars for that one). Anyway I thought the storyline was better than VC Andrew's other novels i.e. Ruby, Heaven, Dawn, Melody... For once VC Andrews's(ghostwriter) made the main character an African-American female. I like the character Rain because unlike the other main character's in VC Andrews's other stories, Rain speaks her mind. I have one question though? In Rain's case...I would never want a relationship with a man that I grew up with as my blood brother and found out later on he wasn't. I would still think of him as a brother. That's repulsive! I get the Heebie Jeebie's just thinking about Roy and Rain. That's VC Andrews for you...the more incest the better. Either way this book was excellent and I'm on page 5 of LIGHTNING STRIKES the second novel in the Hudson series."
1,VCA Must Be Rolling Over in her grave....,"Dawn, I mean Ruby, i mean Rain, yeah, Rain was just the same old thing only repackaged in a different form. It gets very tiresome that the ghostwriter doesn't use his own material when he writes these novels then they would be very exciting and might actually be good. Not really looking forward to Secrets of the Morning, oops, i mean Lighting Strikes. With the mini-series, I lost all faith in the VCA francise for it seem to degrade VCA's memory and writing talent. His excuse for writing the crappy mini-series is that he felt that VCA would have moved onto today's problems. If she didnt write about today's problems when she was alive, why would she write about them now if she was still living? It's just an excuse to churn out these sappy TEEN oriented novels and kick us older readers to the side. So, mr author of the DEvil's Advocate, i read your the novels that you wrote under your real name why cant you add some of your writing to VCA?"
4,"Rain, Rain, Don't go Away","I have not been able to read all of the books written by V.C. Andrews. But flowers in the Attic was one of the best. But Rain was not as bad as some of the crtics are rating it. It was well worth the time and reading. It was some what realistic compared to some books that have been wriiten by V.C. Andrews. I have to also say that one character in the book did drag on and he really could have been left out. But all in all it kept my attention and it had a fairly descent plot. I guess the book could of used more of a suspense, vigance and mystery. What most of the readers are use to. I think they are just giving the ghost writter a hard time. I think it would be a great movie and it might draw attention considering Rain is bi-racial. I cant wait till the next book comes out I'm definetly going to buy the book."
4,Viva la Vida,Finally I was able to get this CD. I love it and hear it every single day. It is motivating.
2,No. No. No. No. It's not that good.,"I am not sure which album the majority of these Prince fans have been listening to, but ""Come"" is spectacularly mediocre.None of these songs compare favorably to either his 80's highlights, or even ""Musicology"", his most recent ""comeback"" disc. The grooves are OK, but overall the songs are so boring. 'Boring"" is the one thing Prince NEVER should be, don't you think? They meander, the choruses are difficult to remember five minutes afterwards, the lyrics sound made up...""Come"" and ""Letitgo"" are as close as he comes to anything that would make it to a Prince Best-Of compilation...Even ""Chaos and DIsorder"" is a better album than this.Yes, this album technically was a ""contractual obligation.""It's not one you'll be turning to very often."
2,More wack PRINCE albums,"The death of PRINCE? I'd say so. No more Paisley Park Records,discontent with Warners,time to release the wack stuff. Little does PRINCE knows (or cares) the wacks will hurt his fans more than it will hurt Warners (but I wrote this review too late for that). One word titles ""Come"",""Letitgo"",""Space"" and ""Papa"" are the good tunes. ""Loose"" and ""Orgasm"" are not. ""Solo"" PRINCE sings while someone plays the harp. A harp? PRINCE can't play the harp? If you're a PRINCE fan(atic),collect it. I said collect,not play it."
2,Mostly forgettable,"There are only two tracks on this recording worth listening to. ""Come"" the title track and ""Letitgo"". The rest is a waste of time."
3,NOT his worst,"Anyone who listens to this album can hear for themselves that this is not his worst. I have been listening to his music from the beginning, and believe me he's had a handful of disappointing albums. This is not one of them. It is one of his funkiest/sexiest albums ever. I do not care very much for the personal lives or problems of an artist. The song is what you care about. This album contains several songs that will have you grooving to the beat. Songs like Space, Come, and Letitgo contain some of the craziest grooves he has ever concocted. You would have to be a biased, brain-dead ""fan"" in order not to feel the funk."
5,Wonderful book,This is a great book with wonderful poems. I liked reading Roger's commentary on each poem. It's like being in a book group and hearing someone else's understanding of the poems.
2,Skip this for the 14 oz melting pot with ladle,"I love most everything Lodge Logic, but this little pot was not useful. I've replaced it with the 14 oz melting put with a handle and 2 pouring spouts. This pot is hard to set on a burner, doesn't have pouring spouts, and doesn't have the right kind of handle."
2,Was my least favorite of this series,This book was a very hard read for me --- had to practically force myself to finish it. I normally love Katie's writing style but this one did nothing for me.
1,Last of The Red Hot...what???,"All right. I love Katie and am eagerly awaiting her next Dark Ones installement, Crouching Vampire Hidden Fang but this book was sooo darn boring. I tried and tried to like it inspite of the completely annoying main character and the only so-so red-hot vamp but in the end I skipped more then I read and put the book down just as quickly as I picked it up. I feel like this book was a bunch of ideas rolled into one and then never fully developed. I didn't like all that other realm crap and couldnt be more disappointed that I ended up paying full price for it. A great author isnt going to get it right everytime so I dont fault her at all I just really HATED this book.Pia Thomason's tale on the other hand was absolutely hillarious. A perfect blend of action, romance, suspense and smoldering vamps that will melt women in all the right places."
3,"so so! good for a rainy day, boring",I was so bored at reading this book. usually i can blow thru a book and don't like to be bothered while I was reading. for once i was hoping something would distract me. i couldn't wait for it to be over with.
4,Good Scriptural Advice,"Using the Bible as his basis, the author tells us that often God guides us incrementally, i.e., that we have ""light for our path,"" but do not necessary see a long way down the road. Similarly he talks about taking opportunities as they present themselves as a form of guidance. If you're in a circumstance, do what is best at that time and place.He also points out that God may have a person in a place for a while, but things change and there comes a time to move on.One assurance that is given to people who might fear missing God's direction is that God takes the initiative in guidance. If we're sincere in wanting His will, He will see that His will is done, Smith emphasizes. He tells us the Shepherd illustration in the Bible is reassuring in making this point clear. Not only that, but God's guidance is a gift!There are some areas in this book where I completely disagree with the author. Overall, however, I found more positive than negative--by far."
5,Excellent router,"I bought this router kit as an upgrade to a Black & Decker 1 HP router from around 1990. The B&D; router worked... but this router is SO much better. It comes with two bases and it is very easy to change between the two. It also comes with all the collets and a second base for them.I love the variable speed and the soft start. It is also incredibly quiet compared to the B&D.; I also had no problems whatsoever with it, everything worked perfectly and still does after a year of ownership. It's powerful and it works, and it was a good price.I would definitely recommend this router."
4,GREAT BUT HAS A FEW FLAWS,"I AM NEW TO WOODWORKING AND THIS IS MY FIRST ROUTER, THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS ROUTER IS THE INSTRUCTIONS. THEY ARE NOT WELL DETAILED AT ALL, STILL HAVING ISSUES WITH ADJUSTING HEIGTH OF BIT . HITACHI REALLY NEEDS TO WORK ON EXPLAINING THE OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF THIS ROUTER BETTER, THERE SEEMS TO BE MORE EXPANATION IN FRENCH THEN THERE DOES ENGLISH, OVER-ALL VERY PLEASED WITH PURCHASE..."
2,"cheap plastic smell, usmooth plunger","The plunger can't automatically raise smoothly.Requested a replacement.The plastic smell seems strong like cheap plastics. A bit curious about the quality. But it seems quite, so I'd like to have another try with the replacement one."
5,Never better,"I have been an avid woodworker for many years. This is without a doubt the best and easiest to use router I have ever owned. I have always used Porter Cable or some other big name brand. But this guy puts them all to shame. It's very well machined, the motor and base plate fit together tighter than others and they still move very freely. The whole router just feels better made. You can see & feel the quality of this router the minute you lift it out of the storage case. Which by the way is the nicest case I have ever seen. I usually toss the cases I get but this one is so well thought out I kept it to store all the extras that came with the router and other things I like to keep close for routing."
4,Pennsylvania RR Rolling Stock,"Since I am a resident of Pennsylvania, I am trying to obtain all the different rolling stock with the name of the Pennsylvania RR. This gondola HO car will be a nice addition. The package was shipped & received on time. The item was packaged very good. The only item I was not happy about is that one of the wheels was laying loose in the package & I had to put it back on, which was not a real problem."
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!,"This is THE LAST Dummies book that I will EVER purchase. Whaddya mean, Internet Edition??? What about desktop publishing, PageMaker's forte??Lousy title, lousy book, lousy marketing scheme. IDG Books - you should be ashamed of yourselves. If there was a rating less than 1 star, this book would be most deserving of it."
5,So beautiful,"I have always loved Haitink's interpretation. So call it slow. I call it patient, ponderous, and majestic. The sound quality of the CD is excellent."
4,Gem Magic,This is a really cute hair accesory. It took a while for me to get the hang of how much hair to put in to get the gems to look good. My 5 year old daughter loves it! I wish it had come with more hair gems or at the very least how you could order replacements. You definately need more gems than the ones that come with the Conair jeweler
4,Conair Quick Gems,I bought Quick Gems for my 9 year old daughter for her birthday and she loves it! She puts the gems in her hair by herself. The only problem I have is finding all those little gems around the house! But - overall a great product that any little girl will love.
1,Terrible product,"This is one of the worst products I have ever bought. The jewels always get stuck in the chamber, and then they get broken when you try to free them from the jam! We used it twice and then I threw it out. Do not buy this unless you like junk."
3,disatisfied,"I thought the product worked ok, but my 9 year old daughter says that the gems fall out of her hair very easily. I guess it just takes practice on how much hair to use in each strand. She is frustrated and doesn't want to use it anymore."
5,Last Mouse Pad you ever need,"I use my computer, I am not talking alike most people either. I sit at my computer 10+ hours a day, both for my work, and play. I am a gamer as part of my job so my mouse is in near constant motion. I bough this pad 5 years ago and even today I am still using it. It cleans super easy, can sit anywhere on your desk and even if devices have to sit on part of it, the thin design means it does not matter. These are ultra durable and literally have out lasted ANY mouse pad I have ever used. In fact I just ordered a new one just to have it in stock, after 5 years I figure it might be getting close to it's end of life.Seriously this is the best mouse pad out, period!"
3,"Could have been the BEST, but failed to deliver.","I have a huge problem with the ""non slip bottom"" It does slip. Lets face it, any slip of a mouse pad is unacceptable, and this thing moved A LOT! Otherwise I love the fit and design, and in theory this was the mouse pad to end all mouse pads for me. Its super size allows parking for two (I have laptop I run simultaneously with desktop so two mice is a must) and the graphic design looks like it would do wonders for micro tracking adjustments inside my graphic programs.I never got far enough to test it. With the slipping being so noticeable right from the start I tried to remedy this problem. Unfortunately my solution was ultimately the demise of part of my desk and the mouse pad. (see photo)DO NOT GLUE (3m spray glue) this mouse pad to anything. OK, Maybe it wasn't the brightest idea, but what a disaster."
4,Does what it says,"I own a flat-top range, which possibly makes it easier to clean grease. Still, without using a splatter screen I'd wind up with grease in all sorts of places. Unambitious, but of good quality. It fits in the dishwasher though takes up most of the top shelf."
4,Inspirational,"A very inspirational story. Good for stock investors perhaps looking to venture into real estate, or the other way around.In general, the time period portrayed in the book (late 1990's - early 2000's) was fairly unusual in that stocks performed much worse than real estate, and both investment vehicles showed abnormal volatility. Although it is a good story, I believe it is unlikely to achieve similar results in future time periods.The one big takeaway was that according to the author, there are 2 types of appreciation in real estate. One is ""sit bank and do nothing"" caused by general inflation, and one is actively improving your property by sorting out problems and raising rents. Such is not the case in passive stock investing.A great read, recommended!"
5,A MUST FOR NANA FANS,"I have been a fan of Nana Mouskouri for over 30 years, I have most of her records and CD's. This one I can recommend 100 per cent, it is absolutely brilliant."
1,do not make the same mistake I did,"unfortunately this item seemed to be ""child-sized"" and though the width of the net was standard, the height was not. Also, bought because it was one of the only brands with steel poles but alas, the metal split open and was likely a cheap quality. No instructions were included either; too dejected to return and just sucking up the loss"
3,Blast from the past,"The movie is a hoot, but the picture quality is poor, and the audio is just awful. But the movie is so off the wall, it's worth the $6.99 just as a history lesson, as they certainly don't make them like this anymore!"
5,The media does a job on keeping good things away from us,"I got this gem for free as a promo in 1994. Six years later, when I needed good background music to sooth and inspire, I put this on. It filled the room with the most melodic, upbeat, sweet (as others have put it) and moving stuff I have ever heard. I have only took this cd off my player a few times since my ""discovery"". Why aren't the radio stations in LA, the big music town, playing this? I know, too well performed and professional for them."
1,If you have money to burn,"Everyonce and a while a game comes along that you wonder why it was made. Well, I guess you know why its made but can't understand wasting man hours to create a sub par game. I found myself instantly bored of the poor graphics and control. Even fans of this music or genre will wish they never purchased this."
1,to bad i cant go lower then one star,"dont waste your money on this garbage....not even worth a rental.if you like really crappy games that you can barely control because it is so bad then get this. if you like unnecessary swearing...that is so corny because its there to be more ""hardcore""...then buy this game. if you like crappy rap music and all of that g-unit garbage that those clowns spew out...then you might like this game. if you like playing as an egotistical piece of garbage....then you just might like this game. if you are unintelligent...then you just might like this game.if none of this sounds like you....then stay as far away from it as you can."
1,Spend your money else where,You can do so much more with your money than buy this game. Such as buy paris hilton's sex video. Just don't buy this.
3,Not what I Expected,"This was a good game and all, but I beat it in a matter of days. I loved the game and found it very exciting, but IT IS ONLY WORTH RENTING, NOT BUYING!!!!!!"
1,Avoid like the plague,What a waste of money this game was. IF there's a dollar to be made from anything this egotistical piece of trash will slap his name on it. It should be a crime to charge money for this garbage. If you have an extra 50 dollars and just have to buy some video games with it I recommend Grand Theft Auto San Andreas or get the GTA3/Vice City Doublepack. These are very well designed fun games with a high replay value. Or if you're a fan of shooters get The Punisher. This game is like a retarded version of The Punisher.
2,Good Idea -- Poor Execution,"There are a lot of wonderful stories in New York, but unfortunately you won't find them in this book.Instead, you'll find a pastiche of trivia, factoids, and opinion. Which would be fine if so much of it weren't, in fact, ""Strange but False."" Dates are constantly stated incorrectly and stories that are best questionable--and at worst untrue--are presented as fact. (For example, the barrels on the seal of New York City aren't there because barrel-making was such a hot industry in the city; they are there to represent flour milling. And there weren't 500 brothels in the Five Points in the 1850s. These are just two of MANY questionable entries.)On the other hand, in the section of ""Urban Myths,"" stories that are definitely true (such as the finding once of a small caiman [an alligator-like creature] in Central Park) are presented as tall tales.The book is highly disorganized and seems to have zero fact checkers. Which is odd with a book called ""Strange But True."""
4,A Great Reference Book,I have read the book in its original manuscript form and in its entirety. Every business worth the name should have this book. It greatly increases your productivity in a practical sense. The current book does not contain many of the ideas of the original manuscript - yet excellent results are achievable in business process implementation and are simplified. Good reading as well.
5,Excellent Scholarly Resource,"Simply put, anyone who may be seeking an alternative critical understanding of early Christian literature apart from the Eurocentric story line is encouraged to read this work by Dr. Byron. Her work is a welcome departure for those who haven't (and perhaps moreso for those who have) been lulled by the false belief that Christianity is wholly the product of white western society. Dr. Byron re-orients our misconceptions about ancient Biblical resources and clearly makes her case using ancient Ethiopic manuscripts that there are indeed many origins of Christianity and many centers of early Christian influence other than Roman. This is a great resource for serious Biblical scholars who wish to have a more profound understanding of indigenous responses to colonialism and World Christianity today."
4,not bad,"This album wasn't too bad. If you remember Rex Allen Jr. and like his music, then this album is for you. ""I'm Getting Good at Missing You"" and ""Two Less Lonely People"" are my favorite songs off this album. You might like it if you like Rex."
3,Disappointing and Superficial,"Six games covered in 38 minutes. It doesn't have the original announcing, not even the famous call, ""The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant!"" when reviewing the famous playoff game between the Giants and the Dodgers. There is no mention of Mickey Mantle being injured in the second game of the World Series, and there is no live action commentary on the tape."
2,cast iron is wonderful,"I have to admit that I am a cast iron fanatic. I have a kitchen full of all kinds of cookware but 90% of the time I end up using a piece from my cast iron collection. This Lodge square skillet is a fine, usefull piece. It is pre-seasoned at the factory and cleans up like a breeze. Just a litle water and a stiff brush is all you need. The properties of cast iron make cooking easy with usually good results. It's especially good for searing and roasting."
5,Great reading,"I can see how some readers might struggle with this one, there are at least three time lines alternating through this book, but for me it really worked. Sallis kept me interested in each part of the story (the far past, near past, and present). He has a knack for imagery and knows how to paint a scene. Likewise, the characters are well developed and believable. I just bought the other two books in this series because I enjoyed this one more than anything I've read yet this summer."
2,so-so,This book reads like it was churned out in the mystery mill of the South. Very cliche. I'm not looking for more from this author.
4,Cypress Grove,"I am in the process of reading this mystery novel. The story switches back and forth a lot from the present to the character's past life and experiences. It is a good story: however, I sometimes get a bit bored."
3,Too Many Statistics,"I recently became disabled and I was hoping that this book would give me some tools or strategies to help me cope. I think it had been recommended on the Muscular Dystrophy Association website. Unfortunately it was mostly full of statistics and dry facts and I also hadn't remembered to check the publication date, most of the facts were taken from studies done in the 1980's and early 90's. The other issue was that there was alot of focus on women with spinal cord injuries which is a much more drastic disability then what I have. Some of it was interesting and informative however so I'm still glad I read it, mostly it's just that it wasn't what I was expecting so I was a little disappointed."
5,"There are just flowers, but they do have HALL & OATES!","I am crazy about Hall & Oates soulful song, ""I can't go for that"", I bought the 12"" single(7 minutes). It's totally useless, as I burned out the LP, back in 1982.Now, I hear SIMPLY RED is using the guys whole soul background track for""SUNRISE"". I heard it on Youtube. That song blew me away, didn't care for the video, but Mick's use of Hall & Oates soulful song worked, Daryl & John should get royalties for this version of their ""CLASSIC"". The Bent remix of this song is as good as SUNRISE. What a great song!"
3,diana less the supremes,"After hearing Ain't No Mountain High Enough in the car, I rushed to buy this ""collection"" of Ms. Ross and my sentimentally got the best of me. This is Diana Ross' collection, not Ross and the Supremes. While there are a few real oldies (for those of us who grew up with Motown), most of the songs are from her movies and distinctively disco era. I have no complaints...But if you want the Supremes like I did, this is not the cd for you."
4,Lightweight and powerful,Trimmer does exactly what I need it to do in my yard. It becomes unplugged fairly easily but doesn't get wrapped in the cord.
1,"Beautiful, handy, but not durable!","I bought this grass trimmer by the end of last year to trim my small garden. After only 4 uses, the motor broke down! I took it to a Black & Decker authorized dealer in my country (I'm not in the US)and they told me the motor was broken and that there is no way to fix it. They offered me a new motor, but it was more expensive than a new trimmer so I just left it that way.Consider other options, this trimmer is not good."
1,Boo!,"amazingly light weight, just like described.if only the Black & Decker electric grass trimmer worked for more than three uses!grass trimmer went kapput 3 minutes into 3rd use.boo!"
4,Mom said it worked good,I bought this as a gift for my mother. I asked her how she like it and she said it worked good. That's all.
2,"so, so","I cuts about as well as I expected at this price-point, not stellar, but it definitely could use an extra few inches in length. I'm about 5' 8"" tall, and this is way too short."
1,Under powered weed eater,"Unfortunately this weed eater just does not have enough power. Honestly I think you could stop it with your hand and not get hurt. It just will not cut the grass without holding the unit over the blades for several passes. Also the way it is built (so the blade on the safety guard cuts the line if it gets too long) slows down the line even more. I tried to go cheap and buy this unit since I was not going to do any heavy cutting with it but now I am sorry I did, once again you get what you pay for. Do yourself a favor and pass on this product."
4,A small size product with lots of BIG power,"The perfect size trimmer for both tough trimming and delicate yard manicuring. Quiet and easy to operate. You won't find this 9"" inch cutting size in most big box stores - but easy to order on line."
4,Exactly what I expected.,"As others have noted, this product is very light, which is important to people (like me) with back problems. It seems sturdy enough, was a snap to assemble, and works well. Yes, it does tend to fling debris at your feet, but so did my heavy, expensive one."
2,not that great,"pile of junk for my needs, but that is understandable for the price I paid for it. but string trimmers are junk anyway because the string always breaks"
1,Not even strong enough to cut through grass,Cheap price and product. This trimmer certainly falls under the you get what you pay for department. The motor is so weak that the trimmer barely cuts through the grass in my yard. I'd recommend spending a little more for a trimmer that will actually trim grass.
4,"A mystery, a village, a skewed time line, and . . . .","Delicious village-cozy. Read it as much for rich characterizations and author/viewpoint-character's observations as for the puzzle.The body of an elderly children's nurse, reported missing, is found by two children, beyond where she could have walked. She is the recent recipient of a generous bequest by a former child-in-charge, delighting her niece who would inherit, appalling another who had hoped to inherit the sum to restore the family seat. But, one of the children says Nanny was dead in her house before the alert about her missing has gone out, and the autopsy says Nanny had indeed died before the alert.Add a resident rock-star, a neighbor who ""sees"" things vaguely, an Arabian woman with a secret, several motorcycles and people riding them, the policeman's little girl who barely survived the auto accident that killed her mother.And it's the intro to a series, so there's more joy to come."
2,Just Another Carbon Copy,"Brandston is a preatty good band but just like most new indie bands, they lack originality. This album borrows heavily from bands that have come before them like Mineral, Braid, and Sunny Day Real Estate. I'm not saying this cd isn't good, i really enjoy it, but don't expect it to blow you're mind because you've probobly own a ton of albums that sound identical to it."
3,Excellent Production Quality; Too Cartoonish,"In terms of production quality - particularly the animation - this movie is probably the best of the Wallace and Gromit series.Having said that, I agree with other reviewers that the plot is violent in a way that prior W&G; features were not. Death plays the central role here, and parents may wish to screen the movie before showing it to their young children, just in case.Overall, I thought the action was just too ""cartoonish"". More like an old Looney Tune feature than typical W&G.; It abandons dry, subtle wit in favor of wild, fast action. For instance, there's a scene where Gromit runs at near light-speed to intercept Wallace as he's about to taste some soup and I swear the soundtrack includes audio of the Road Runner taking off with Wile E. Coyote in pursuit.For W&G; fans, this obviously has a place in the collection. But don't expect too much from it."
3,Great animation as always but too violent?,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I've actually seen this. It was broadcast in the UK many months ago.While the animation is brilliant as always, the script is not quite as stellar as The Wrong Trousers (it's similar to A Close Shave in terms of the characters and plot), and overall it seems much more scary and violent than Nick Park's previous offerings, including the feature-length Curse of the Were-Rabbit.I know these are generally released as UNRATED here in the USA but my suggestion to parents would be to give it a go yourself before getting the family in front of the screen. It's especially harsh with regard to treatment of pets.Having said that, it has some funny moments; I particularly enjoyed the Ghost homage."
3,Too short!,"The film is very short. I was hoping it would be ""more."" Not that great of a movie really either. I loved the other Wallace and Gromit adventures...not their best work."
4,Fun Movie,I liked this movie. It's not as good as the original adventures but it has some funny moments. Great for Wallace & Gromit fans.
3,Not as good as prior titles,"Lacks the originality and charm of its predecessors, but worth watching to admire the technical aspects of claymation - a good title to borrow from the library instead of purchasing. OTOH, the Shaun the Sheep extra is actually decent (better than the episodes I happen to have seen on the dedicated Shaun the Sheep DVDs)."
1,Introducing murder to small children,"I bought this together with the other ones in a pack. I already own the other three but bought the whole thing again. I was shocked and very disappointed about the murder theme of this episode. We started to look at it together with my two 5 years old sons, who love the other three films. I had to shut down the TV after a few minutes, as the whole movie started to get violent with murder attempts. Really disappointing!"
2,Tired re-run of a Doctor Who classic,"The sequel to 'The Curse of Peladon', the third Doctor and Sarah arrive on the planet of Peladon, some 50 years after the original.Peladon has joined the Galactic Federation, and things are not as King Peladon had envisaged. His daughter, Queen Thalira, in now ruler and she leads her people as the Federation is at war with Galaxy 5. But someone is causing trouble...The main problem is that this story is that it is pretty much a rerun of the earlier story, but not as good. This is more or less a join the dots version of a Doctor Who story, and is therefore sadly not very good. Even the political commentary, this time the miners' strike, is rather more limp that the original.Terrance Dicks does a workman like job, but it is based on such a low basis to start from that there is no real hope."
4,Kal MSM 1000mg 1000mg 240 Tabs,Received the item about five days later than originally expected. I had to write to find out where it was. The product was as expected.
3,Classic book,Realized after it arrived that I already have a more recent version. Good basic information for novice riders..I will gift it to someone else.
2,difficult to find,"I first bought the liners, thinking they would fit the normal bottle. After finding out they don't, I looked a lot for these specific bottles, and just found them at amazon, any other store. I could finally use my liners! The bottles are ok, not too different from the regular one."
1,Contains BPA!!,Be forewarned the Tempo line contains BPA in the bottles! The ring touches the milk or formula (leakage of the neurotoxin can occur!). Why create a BPA-Free liner with a bottle that has polycarbonate in it? I got fooled... I don't want you to as well! Take care. Let's keep our babies safe!
3,"It handles bass, but doesn't quite deliver","The headphones overall are great; confortable, lightweight, and cheap. However, I was a little disappointed when I opened them. The music (a lot of bass filled, electronic music) sound like it was played out of a tin can. However, when I went to the equalizer settings on my iPod, and chose the ""Bass Booster"" everything sounded fine and clear. The headphones can handle the quality many buyers desire, but it doesn't not initially bring it to the table.They're great out of the house, but if you want a nice, quality pair of headphones for home, there's a wider selection at the same price."
4,Great Sound for a Great Price,"Few years back, I had a pair of Sennheiser over the ear headphones. Sadly, they gotten broke by a uncareful friend. So now, after buying really terrible earbuds; I decided I need something similar to the ones that were broken. I went with these and I am so satisfied. Music sounds so clear and wonderful."
3,ehhhhh,I bought these headphones to use with my electric drum set.Yes they are cheap.Yes they are sennheiser (Which is a great brand)but to tell the truth the bass on these headphones is absolutely terrible.so if you just want something that makes noise.get them. but if you are actually serious about sound quality.you need to bite the bullet and get some higher quality headphones.
3,Do not buy these.,"Spend the extra $20 on the HD212s. You will not regret it.I got these with my PepsiStuff points, in which case, they're a decent value for the money. They're certainly not terrible headphones. I'm no audiophile, but I'd say the quality is decent. But they're far more uncomfortable than the 212s. They feel hard, don't adjust well, and the headphones are too small to completely encapsule your ear, but too big to settle on them nicely. My ears hurt after only about half an hour of listening.The volume is also comparatively poor. Using them with my Zune, an 18-19 volume level is about equal to a 12 on the 212s.Also, the 212s have detachable wires. I've stepped on the chord a few times while they've been plugged in to my computer, bending the jack, but I was able to buy replacements. The wires on these are not detachable.If you really can't spend a penny more, you could do worse. Otherwise, go for the better models. It really is worth it."
5,Feathers with an attitude!,"They were a gift for my parents but I tested them before sending them on, and boy was I surprised.Audio excellence (as to be expected from Sennheiser products) and they're so light that I immediatelyforgot that I had them on so I immediately checked my head to make sure they didn't fell off.Some audiophiles will complain about how they can't feel their neurons dying from vibration stress dueto the lack of bass or loudness to these, but my parent's cant tell the difference (and neither could I).They are a bit airy so you will be able to listen to your surroundings at humane volume levels but thatis how I use them (apparently its a good thing to be able to listen to people when your old). But don'tbe fooled, you can burst your ear drums with these if you have an amp capable of it and you're a masochist."
2,"Good sound, good fit, poor craftsmanship","When I got these headphones, I liked them quite a bit. They had good (not excellent) sound, and a very comfortable fit.However, after 6 months, the right channel completely died. I've used a number of over-ear headphones over the years, and this is by far the shortest duration I've had a pair last.If the build quality were better, these would be 5-star economy headphones. As they currently are, they are 2-star ""disposable"" headphones."
3,Good enough,"Overall these headphones sound just great with a nice bass and clear middles. They are light and the cord is extra long, which gives you a bit of time to remember that you are still plugged-in when you get up from the computer--primarily where I use these 'phones. The problem is that the materials are a bit thin around the ears and they can get uncomfortable with extended use."
4,Really nice for the price,I bought these after reading some of the many reviews and I must say that I am very happy with them. I also have a pair of Sennheiser EH-150 Evolution Hi-Fi Stereo Headphones and I like these better. They are more comfortable than the EH-150s. I am able to wear them for several hours without any discomfort. The sound quality is really good. In fact it is excellent when you think about it in relation to the price of these headphones. They are a real bargain.
3,Eh,"Pros:* Cheap.* Nice long cord.Cons:* Maximum volume is way lower then I expected. When I have my volume all the way up, I still wish I could increase it by a fair bit. To put this comment in perspective; I'm not the type of person who likes to have really loud music blasting in my ears.* Noise isolation is ok, but nothing phenomenal. The earphones aren't capable of providing any sort of decent seal around my ears."
3,so so headphones,this headphone was not as loud as my logitech identity which was cheaper and the bass is not what I expected. but on the other hand the headphones are really comfortable.
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,I was very disappointed in this product....I can hardly hear anything through them...Volume is REAL low...Not worth the money I paid for them...The cheap set of headphones I paid $5.00 for has more sound then these do.....
1,long cord,The sound is good but the cord is unnecessarily long. Why is it so long? Not sure if I like them enough to use them. Maybe I'll give them to my mom.
5,These are great,"These headphones have really saved me in college. I have to share a room with one other person and when they are say, watching Family Guy, I can listen to some relaxing electronic music with these and they block (most of) the outside noise so that I can concentrate on my work.I am no audiophile but they sound great- I watch movies and listen to all kinds of music on my laptop and they sound great for the price.Another good thing with these headphones is that unlike ""iPod style"" headphones, you don't have to worry about them falling out of your ears and they block outside noises fairly well.A couple gripes about these headphones, though. First, they are not too fashionable. Secondly, the Sennheiser logo printed on the top of the headphones starts to chip off after only a couple months of use.All in all, a great set of headphones, and a great deal for your very own little world."
4,great price for a great product,The headphones have better sound then I expected.Very good deal for the money on a brand name product.
4,Very Good,"Muy buenos audifonos, los materiales son excelentes y lo mas notable de ellos es lo extremadamente largo del cable conector, y que no se apoya en las orejas sino que las cubre sin tocarlasSaludos"
4,Very good product,"I am satisfied hd201 it has really clear sound but not so powerful, Can be con or pro; Cable is so long..."
2,bulky,once I looked at these I returned them-they were too bulky and we travel a lot. I could see not taking them with me due to the size. I could also hear my baby coo in the next room so...
5,Love this,"I've had these headphones for four months now, and never have I heard better quality. They are comparable to the Beatz headphones, minus the swag and the brand name. They cover my ear completely, drowning out unwanted noise, and are comfortable enough to wear for very long periods of time. I have even slept in these.Despite how flimsy the bridge looks, I find it to be very durable. I carry these around constantly and they do not get babied."
1,Breaks after Three Months,"These headphones are pretty cheap, but the high customer reviews persuaded me to give them a try. They have good quality- while they last. This was actually the second pair that I bought. The first pair broke after a few months- something inside the wiring in the jack meant that I got the sound in one ear at a time, if that. (which ear was working varied, and sometimes I could get both ears working) I thought I would try my luck with a second pair- they ARE cheap, and like clockwork, three months and the exact same problem. This time it's even worse, though- I can only get sound in my left ear if I'm actively applying pressure to the jack and twisting it.A number of replies to the other one-star reviews provide contact information to the company with a claim that there's a two-year warranty. Having contacted the company and gotten no response, I'm not optimistic."
1,Gave it away to trash!!,This is undoubtedly one of the worst out there unless I received a defective piece. This just deserved my trash bin!! I did not know Sennheiser guys made headphones this cheap and they don't sound good at all!! I have owned at least half a dozen headphones now but nothing sounded so tinny and cheap!! I'd not recommend this to anyone!!
3,They are okay... not for loud listening.,"Hey there Amazoners!Just a quick note about these headphones... if you love listening to music like I do and want to listen to it loud, don't buy these headphones! They have good base to them but even with my Zune plugged into it that usually pushes out good load sound with crappy headphones, these head phones did not. Hope this helped!"
1,Doesn't live up to Senn's name,"The HD201 rests on the lowest rung of Sennheiser's product line - inexpensive closed headphones with a cheap plastic design and a sound that lags behind its competition in this price range. The sound has surprisng range, but the trebles can be irritating, with a hollowness that can't be overcome by any combination of music and volume. The pads are passably comfortable, and of course, they're composed of an inexpensive leatherette.Most listeners seem to prefer the Koss KSC35 or 75, but many headphone designers have products that surpass these. But these do have one thing going for them - name recognition - and that (with its price) might enough for them to push a few extra units. But if you're expecting a miracle from these headphones, it's probably best to look for your sonic miracles elseware."
5,"Awesome headphones, just make sure you don't sit on them","I've never understood the fantastically high prices of audiophile headphones. If you're like me, when your buddy shows off his new $300 headphones, you just put them on and say ""Wow, I really can't hear anything you're saying right now!,"" feign some awe and jealousy and GO BACK TO YOUR NORMAL LIFE.It's not that I don't appreciate good sound quality. My ex would encode all her mp3s at 96kbps... I'm not gonna say it directly led to our break up but it probably was a factor.These headphones just straight work for me. The cord is long, the earpieces are circumaural and the sound quality is great. They aren't quite as durable as I'd like (my roommate sat on my last pair and they've developed an annoying floppy fargo hat quality to them), but they're affordable so you can just buy another if you break them.Highly recommended."
1,"Uncomfortable, sounds terrible","Ok, what else is there to say? Worst headphones I've ever owned, except for earbuds that came with MP3 players. But I only paid $10 for them at Amazon, so I didn't bother to return them. Good enough for the kids to use on the computer or in-car dvd.FWIW, I later gave Sennheiser another chance, for some reason. I got PX100's. Now that's a good headphone. Pretty outstanding, actually. So thumbs down on the HD201, but Sennheiser is still redeemed."
4,"Acceptable, not great.","I have been using this headphone for about one week. Generally, I am satisfied with it for what I invest.Pros: Design and quality are good--this headphone is one of those will last for years. Sound quality is OK for a 20 bucks product.Cons: But if you want a professional gaming/music headphone, forget it. Sound leaking is significant and noise isolating is null. The biggest problem is the wire---tooooooooooooooooo long. Not ever portable at all.It is no perfect headphone. But it is good enough for what it costs."
4,Great for the price!,"I needed over-ear headphones while working to drown out the noise of other people talking in my lab. These headphones are pretty great for the price and serve the purpose of drowning out other sounds if I play some music. I had tried on the Bose OE headphones in a store and they were so light and comfortable that I absolutely loved them, but they cost about $110 more! I decided to go with Sennheiser and I am not disappointed. These are slightly heavy for my small head but my ears do not hurt even after wearing them for a couple of hours at a stretch. Would recommend!"
4,losing the connection on left ear,best headphone for the price..4 stars only since it didnt last for 3 years but worth paying for. but i dont mind buying another one and break it as long it last for a while. Now they are getting cheaper.
4,Big bang! Little buck!,"First off, let me say, I am a big fan of Sennheiser's Mic lines (especially the drum mic line E-series) Now, i received these headphone free with a purchase of a AT2020 condenser mic. I looked up the price after trying them out just on my computer headphone jack, and I must say I was impressed. I was even more impressed when I saw the price was under $20. I have a pair of ATH-M30 Headphones that I paid 69.99 for and I think I like the Sennheiser HD201 better. I would of liked to have a better cable, it seems a little cheap, also, I would of liked to see a screw on 1/4"" adapter. But for $17 you can afford to buy 3, and still not brake the bank. Note: The material around the ears seem to be a little stiff and when you move your head, the material makes a little noise. But it is still comfortable. In short, I am very impressed with these headphones, and will probably be buying a couple more in the near future.Hope this review was helpful."
4,Very good set of headphones,"They're pretty comfortable and stylish. The sound quality is really good, even on my little mini laptop. The cord is rather long, so if you're someone who needs some space to move while you're jamming, these are your headphones. Like some of the other reviews say, these werent really designed for REALLY high volume listening, but that takes nothing away from the level of sound they bring. A really good investment and a steal for the price."
3,"nice sounds, but not very comfortable","the sound quality is good, but it is not quite comfortable when i put it up for a long time."
4,It's absolutely fantastic,"But...it's a little quiet. Fits comfortably, my ears don't get uncomfortable after prolonged use, this really could've also benefitted from one wire coming from a cup. But they work, and they're cheap. I can't complain."
1,Bad Quality Sound and Uncomfort for a Reasonable Price,"I have a pair of bose that are about to break they even have masking tape to avoid them to fall apart, thats why I thought it was time to get a new pair.I hated this headphones since the first moment I used them. The leatherette is stiff, not comfortable at all. The plastic is cheap I don't know how long would it last. They are too big so they didn't fit me and the noise reduction is null since they don't make any pressure over my ears, and they keep falling backwards from my head. Sound is not as crisp, clear and balanced as I thought it would be, and it seemed to me too low.I'll keep my shattered bose until not wearable."
1,Old Cord Insulation,"The cord insulation on ours was cracked in a dozen places, exposing the copper wire. Returned. Would not buy again."
2,"Not great, not good","Headphones advertised as ""noise canceling"". I could hear more sound happening outside of the headphones than I could from the inside. Ended up returning them. Not worth purchasing if you're looking for something that will block out exterior sound."
4,The product lived up to 50% of my expectations...,"I was looking for headphones which both produced good clear sound quality, and had the effect of noise cancelling. These headphones are excellent for sound quality! Seriously, you don't have to turn up the volume loud to hear all the crisp tones and beats. However, for the noise cancellation, not so much. I figured that since they fit around ear, they would work for this purpose, but not like I expected. It does reduce sound (like by 20% or so), but not to the extent that I would have liked. Overall they still are very good headphones tho."
4,Great value headphone,Plus side:Good sound qualityGood quality cableThe long cable is very useful if you're like me who slides around while doing work.Low costMinus:The foam cushion started to peel after just more than a year.A bit lacking on the high frequencyA bit low in output. It's just about right for my personal listening volume though.
5,Great deal!!!,"So I was looking for a cheap pair of headphones to buy because I always seem to end up breaking them! Usually its the cord that connect to the heaphones. My boyfriend recently bought some Siennheiser headphones, but they were $100+. He loved the quailty and sound from this brand so I though I'd give it a shot! And these ones were super cheap, so even if i do end up breaking them, no worries! :) Sound quality is awesome! You won't be disappointed! :)"
4,"Not the best in comfort, but overall good.","These in my opinion are not comfortable when wearing them for more than 2 hours. The plastic on the inside will rest against your ear making it quite uncomfortable. Also the padding could be a bit larger and softer.That's really the only thing I found bad about these. The sound quality is good, surprisingly good noise canceling, decent materials, and very light."
4,"Good sound qualilty, and medium comfort while worn",It doesn't cause my skin and ears to sweat from being covered for a long time which is a blessing. At the same time it has good sound quality which lets me get through the work day while enjoying my tunes.
2,"Dissapointed: Average sound, needs power, poor comfort","I expected more from Sennheiser. Guess I got my hopes up for such an entry level price. But for $21 I'll just give them to my kid. I know it's not apples to apples but my $16 KOSS KSC-75's have FAR superior sound. I also have a pair of $60 Grado SR60's that blow these HD201's away. Just not impressed at all.Pros: PriceCons: Poor sound, needs power, Not that comfortable."
2,Good headphones but...,"Recently, I bought these headphones because I wanted the full experience for music with a touch of Deep-bass in any song in my personal music Library. Unfortunately, these so-called HD headphones did not deliver on what I wanted in a pair of full-cup headphones. Each time I wanted to listen to songs with a deep-bass pulse, it skips in the sound quality output because of the extensive cord. That's not what I wanted in a pair of awesome headphones. But yeah, it works on some songs, but not all of them. But the best parts of this product is that it is very comfortable, very relaxed and keeps your ears warm...with the power of music, that is. :D"
2,NOT Sennheiser's best,"I bought these headphones to replace some Sony's my cat had ruined by chewing the cord. I use headphones when I'm listening to music while on my computer so as not to disturb others. I bought these Sennheisers because I knew of the Sennheiser reputation for quality. But, I have to tell you these are not their best. In fact, they must be their worst! They have no sensativity at all! To drive the speakers in these earphones you have to crank up the volume to near max before you can hear anything. This has the unwanted effect of heating up your computer which is already heat sensitive. No, I agree with the guy who wrote the review called ""Not loud enough, sibilant, slightly bright"". Don't buy these if you intend to use them on anything but a full size home stereo system."
3,not overly impressed,"The reviewer, Raul Saavedra, was spot on with his review. My biggest complaints involve the sibilance of the sound and the lack of bass. On the plus side, they are fairly comfortable and really not terrible for the price. Unfortunately, I was expecting much more from these guys, so I'll be returning."
4,Great!,They fit perfectly on the handles of my Lodge cast iron pans. I can't feel a lot heat through them when I'm cooking on the range top but if I take a pan out of the oven the heat goes through them almost immediately.
2,May be usefull for some.,"May shield heat a touch better than a kitchen glove. They are OK if you are going to use them on the cast iron handles for a few seconds at a time. Anything longer than that and they will get hot and so will your hands. So, unlike what a previous reviewer said, you cannot leave them on while the pot is on the stove, unless you are not cooking long enough for the handles to get hot (and in that case why even buy them), or if you want to get burned. The choice is yours. Hope this helps."
3,Lodge 2-Piece Hot Handle Holder Set,"When cooking with cast iron skillets, these pans get HOT, extending through to the handles. I ordered the hot handle holder sets but it did not reduce the heat from the handle as I expected. Using one of the holders I continued to feel the high heat. But it worked better when I used two of the holders on the hot handle. It's too bad Lodge didn't make one holder strong enough to withstand the heat from the handle. CAUTION: Please note that these mitts are very flammable. Twice, the mitt caught fire from being in contact with the flame from a gas stove. Since these mitts are used to protect the handle from the heat, be careful to leave enough distance between the material and the cooking surface to prevent the mitt from catching on fire."
2,shouldn't take that long to ship!,I order it for xmas gift. It takes a month to get there. What did you do make by hand... If your going to sell it have it ready....
1,The Boo,"Poor rewrite of an early book. Love Pat Conroy, but seems like a quick way to make a buck. Very disappointed."
1,Very bad first book,This is obviously the authors first attempt at a book. Fortunately his writing improved. Skip this one and go on to the rest of his books which are quite good.
3,Part of the story,Seems to be a necessary part of the life story. Seemed to be tough in a lot of places but I guess that;s life!
4,Good enough...,"The book was not great but was good enough for Conroy's first book. It was a glimpse of what was yet to come, his five other books being excellent."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,Without Stevie Nicks & Lindsay Buckingham this album was hardly worth the effort. Buy it only if you need something to help you drift off to sleep. The fact that 2 years later the McVies and Fleetwood returned to recording with Buckingham and Nicks should tell you that the faux Mac sound on this album was both a critical and commercial failure.
3,"Interesting, new members give Fleetwood Mac a different flavor...","Some people consider that some ""Classic"" band lineups should never be changed. This is true for Fleetwood Mac.... But, even when in this album Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham are not part of the boys in the band, having Dave Mason and a wonderful female voice (Bekka Bramlett) give to Fleetwood Mac a different, interesting ""flavor"" to their music. An interesting one, but only for serious Music fans.I warn you, if you have the prejudice of ""Only the original lineup is acceptable"", then do not listen this CD..."
5,The Only Way to Cook a Turkey,"As a young mom, I noticed that my Italian neighbor used the Rometopf for everything she baked. I gave it a try. I think it is the only way to get a carefree turkey that has moist breast meat and nicely browned skin. Even my non cook daughter in law made a fantastic turkey with the clay baker. It is great for any meat you want to bake and bread pudding.Remember to soak it in water before using. It is a life saver if you get a late start on a holiday dinner or important meal. I have used a Rometopf for over 30 years and still love using it. I put it inside my dishwasher with no soap or rinse agent and run a cycle. It comes out fresh and has no soap or rinse residue to worry about."
2,Not as seasoned as it needs to be for eggs,"I got this because I need more iron, and I eat a lot of eggs. I found the surface too rough to cook eggs and get them out of the pan. You would have to float them on butter or oil to get them out of this pan. Back to my non stick pan...I would take it camping, if I ever went camping."
2,Not good,"Too heavy. I used it under 10 times, and yet it was burned on the side, leaving a yellowish mark on the side. And again, TOO heavy."
1,came damaged,There was a big chip on the edge.I could peel it off. I am So disppointed with the Lodge skillet they sold at Amazon!!
5,Great Non-Stick Alternative,"I don't use teflon anymore now that I have these pans. If you treat them right, they are non stick without all the who-knows-what contained in teflon.PROS: non-stick if you take care of it, can withstand very high heat (i stuck it in my 900 degree wood burning oven), durable.CONS: takes more care than a teflon pan, heavier than most pans, don't cook anything acidic."
5,13 dollars? what a great choice!,"This is my first cast iron skillet. After trying it out for a couple of months, I totally love it.I find it perfect for cooking one or two eggs in the morning. Because it's so small, it's not too heavy at all. So if you don't like the weight of cast iron cookware, this one is not a problem.Things like eggs got sticky at the beginning, but after several times of use, it became as easy as non-stick skillets. Even better, I use less oil to cook eggs with this skillet. A very thin layer of oil will do the job. Things taste same or less greasy, and it feels much healthier."
3,Great Item: Terrible Price,"This is the perfect cake board, but at 12.66 for only 8 boards, that is a TERRIBLE price. I found these in the craft section of Wal-Mart for only $4.00 and was so depressed I had already ordered them on amazon for $12.66"
2,2 Failed after a year,"Both my brother and I got this watch ~ 2 years ago for Christmas. I was drawn to it because it's the same interface as the Nike running watches, but you can replace your own battery which is a huge plus. During the time that it worked, it was a perfect watch. Good chronograph features, 2 time zones, stored runs... it was everything I needed. Then, after about 15 months, the beeper on mine stopped working, which was sad because I tend to use the alarms a lot during my day. Fancy it breaking after a 1 year warranty from High Gear. This would have been fine but when I returned home for the summer, my brother told me his stop watch was no longer working. It still displayed the time, but wouldn't start counting in the chronograph mode. One out of two can be bad luck, but having two out of two fail is strong evidence of very poor quality control. For me I guess it's back to the Nike, and just not being able to replace the battery myself."
3,The Story of BIG...TEN Years Later,"Good movie on the behind the scenes with the whole bad boy family and junior mafia. Im glad i got it, it gave me a diff understanding of the members apart of the junior mafia."
4,Underwater 007 and Beyond,"This is a fine James Bond soundtrack. I like this soundtrack because you get a lot of the James Bond Theme intermixed into the score. The restoration is OK but some of it sounds muffled. Still, it is good to have extra tracks."
3,ok,This comforter looks cute but it is 100% cotten and is very wrinkled when on the bed... Doenst look good in the bed and also colors are not that bright... My three year old daughter loved it though
2,Not For Someone Looking For Practical Information,"I purchased two books on Amazon at the same time, hoping to learn practical information about raising pigs: (1) The Complete Pig, and (2) Storey's Guide to Raising Pigs. I wasted my money on The Complete Pig. It does have a lot of cute photos and some interesting pig stories, but it has virtually no practical information. On the other hand, Storey's Guide to Raising Pigs was outstanding."
2,Ick,"I love Lemon Jelly, but this album falls far, far short. All the songs seem drawn out and like they got lost halfway through and just don't reach any conclusion. Go with Lost Horizions instead."
1,Don't Bother,"This book was so bad that I stopped reading it after one chapter ( a rareity for me). I am sure that Perri Klass is an excellent doctor, but she should stick to medicine. The book overall lacked life. It didn't take form in the first couple of pages that are crucial for an author. Maybe it's more of a chick book, but if you are looking for literary substance, skip over this one."
4,"A very good read, even if you could care less about football","Toss is a very satisfying read, one that is hard to put down. The research was excellent and the story unfolds quickly, without a lot of boring - and unnecessary - football details. Don't get the wrong idea - there is lots of football 'stuff' in this book and the facts ring curiously true. Most of the events probably really occured, names changed to protect the guilty. Yes, I read North Dallas Fourty. This book is nothing like that. It is told from the rookie point of view, by someone still in love with the game. The characters are vivid with gratuitous sex kept to a minimum. This book will be enjoyed by both men and women."
4,speaks to me,I like the fluid images and the tasteful shades. its not an easy deck to read from if you are accustomed to the rider waite imagery but the pictures do speak in a different kinda way..the minideck is really handy to carry. i think its great for everyday and relationship readings as a story always comes out to the fore in each spread in intuitive readings.
3,Norpro Meat Veal Pounder,"Works well, the tool is well balanced, for pounding different cuts of meat, not just veal. I highly recommend buying this."
5,"Very, Very, Good.","This book was amazing. I read it on a flight and was so upset when we landed because I had to stop! I was very surprised when I saw that this was the author's first novel, it does not read like one. The plot was exciting, the time period and lush landscapes of Africa were fascinating and the characters beautifully done. I am looking forward to her other books, and cannot wait to follow our heroine on another adventure!"
1,Rough cooking surface,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008GKDJ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleI've used this skillet everyday since receiving it hoping the cooking surface would improve. The rough cooking surface is still casting off iron colored 'muck' when I wash it. I know how to Season a cast iron skillet so this isn't the problem. I'm very unhappy with the pebble like cooking surface.
1,Very disappointing,"There are a number of very good books on Saint John of the Cross, including Fire Within by Thomas Dubay. The work under consideration is not well written and presents comparisons of the Saint to philosophers totally outside the historical and philosophical framework of his teaching. Toward the end of the book, the author actually begins to take a negative attitude toward his subject on both the style of his writing and what he mis-perceives as antiquated ideas. Avoid this book and go for more revealing and well developed works such as the Dubay book previously mentioned."
1,Do Not Observe or Report,"I'll be honest i've seen every Seth Rogen film and have yet to laugh at this guy. I dont understand how anyone could enjoy his movies, they aren't funny and he reminds me of Larry The Cable Guy. Well, that is a bit harsh because Rogen usually has a good leading actor or actress with him. Anna Faris is good but nothing really funny, Liotta plays Rogen's enemy in anther wasted role.The basic plot is Rogen plays a mall cop who wants to be catch a flasher at the mall and be a real cop. Everything is by the books and I never laughed once thru out this film. I'm still waiting too see why Rogen is the next big thing in comedy. People will enjoy this film but I found nothing funny about it, glad I didn't waste money on it."
2,Watch one then done,"This movie really is not worth more than one viewing. The humor really is not that funny. Snicker once, or twice here and there, then the movie ends. The story is dumb as hell, and really should not be attempted to be understood. Buy and watch when dirt cheap, or skip it completely."
1,Horrible movie,"This movie was so horrible...I watched it all the way through but using alcholism, stereotypes, and legitmate psychological problems and turning them into comedy is a slippery, slippery slope in which even Seth Rogen can not pull off.Don't waste your time with this one."
1,"nothing to observe here, people","Once Seth Rogen opened his mouth I started fast-forwarding this. The story and the script are just jaw-droppingly stupid. What Ray Liotta is doing in this, I have no clue unless they wrote him a huge check?Honestly, who thinks Rogen can carry any movie let alone one so poorly put together?If I could this a zero, I would."
2,"Strange, Dark but Just Ok","This movie has its moments. It is very dark and kind of disturbing. In that it is different than a lot of these screwball comedies. That said, it is just ok. Worth a peek but nothing I would rewatch."
2,"Not so great, Seth Rogen fans to be disappointed","I am a HUGE Seth Rogen fan, and this movie disappointed me. It started out quite funny, and then towards the middle and end of the movie it turned into nonsense; a rubbish-written script that leaves you feeling depressed and confused at the end, nothing like Pineapple Express or Knocked Up, or any other. Not recommended at all."
4,Classic 1980s CCM,"Leslie (now known as Sam) Phillips was one of the leading female vocalists in the contemporary Christian music genre in the 1980s. This 10-song collection can hardly be considered ""definitive,"" but it does contain some of her most memorable hits, including ""Strength of My Life,"" ""Your Kindness,"" ""You're the Same,"" and ""Answers Don't Come Easy."" The latter tune is, sadly, the only track included from her acclaimed 1987 album ""The Turning,"" which signaled her departure from Christian to mainstream music. All in all, this is a good budget-priced overview of Leslie's career, but it's certainly not definitive."
3,What happened?,I seriously wonder if she chucked her faith out the window about the same time as it seems Amy Grant did?
4,New Discovery,"When i listen the music of Lisa, is wonderful. I think that belong to the human essence. The voice and the sounds remember our origins. It a unique experience of beauty and sublime.Thank you Lisa for your music."
5,Emotional High,"Incredible CD! I can sum up my reactions to it quite simply. Listen to ""Sanvean."" If the beauty of the melody does not make you weep or send chills up and down your spine or raise goosepimples, then I truly wonder whether you are human, or at least whether you have emotions. Lisa's voice is an instrument; she uses it to capture people's souls."
2,Mirror Pool Review,"I purchased this CD expecting more of what Lisa had done on the Gladiator Soundtrack. I was disappointed though. There are a few ""gems"" on this CD, yet overall it is too dark and I just couldn't get into it. Lisa has an awesome voice, but the musical arrangement on most of the tracks is lackluster."
5,An Eschatological Masterpiece,"In the realm of 9.11.01, the sound (and even the apocalyptic jewelbox graphic) power of Mirror Pool both soothes and haunts us during this time of extreme sorrow."
3,Was hoping for better,"We registered for these for our wedding. I saw them at Bed, Bath, and Beyond. I have this thing about making sure the forks are really pointy. These really were. The ones we got are too! I love this abut them. They are really pretty out of the box and have a very simple style. When opening them I noticed that they were made in Vietnam (in case this is an issue for anyone). It has been about two months since we started using these. The one thing I don't like is that the knives are starting to loose their finish. I was expecting better quality given how much these cost. However that was not meant to be I guess. The rest of the silverware is doing just fine, but I don't know why the knives are this way. Hope this helps!"
2,Pretty...but pretty worthless,"These books were originally written for a French audience, and so unless your climate matches that of France, the statements about the weather that accompanies each season will be inaccurate! ""Spring is the season of mild, showery weather""...summer is a time of brief thunderstorms...beaches aren't cloudy for long...autumn is ""cool"" and ""damp""...and it snows in the winter. In addition, like virtually all the books in this series, it contains factual errors--""no two snowflakes are alike."" That's substituting folklore for fact, which is common with these books.The good points:-The illustrations are lovely-There is a brief, accurate (as far as it goes) description of fog, rainbows, and snow (""ice crystals"")-There is a discussion of the seasons, even if all the details are unlikely to match your climate.This saves it--barely--from one star."
2,not my favorite..but you might like it,"I love many of the other books in the discovery series...I just thought this one wasn't quite as concise and didn't keep it in our little ones' library. But, you may like it."
4,"Good Game, But Too Short","Don't get me wrong this game is by far a better buy then ""Angel of Darkness."" However for a ""Tomb Raider"" game it was too short of a storyline. I was hooked on this game, the controls are so much easier to understand and use. Lara moves so much better then in previous games and the graphics are awesome.As I said the storyline was a disapointment. In ""Tomb Raider Last Revelation"" it took me about a month or more to finish the game completely. This game I was able to beat in 5 days and thats from 5 hours of game play each day about.This is game is worth buying but dont be surprised about how short it is. Eidos needs to know for future games a much longer storyline for Lara Croft game is far better. To this day ""Tomb Raider Last Revelation"" is still by far my favorite."
5,One of my all time favorites,Eau d'Orange Verte by Hermes for Men is one of my all time favorite colognes. The smell of orange and spices is one of my favorites and it is my go to cologne for work most days. Highly recommend it.
5,Why is this such an unknown movie?,"As I sit here listening to the music, I can only wonder that this was so little noticed. A friend loaned it to me, demanding that I watch it right away. Now I have my own copy of the film and the CD (both from Amazon) and I have given them as gifts. The story celibrates performance for the joy of performance. It honor bands and choirs in communities all around Europe and America. And she is such a lovely girl!"
5,"Good music, great actors, right message...","Don't see it for Ewan and Tara, though there's nothing wrong with their performances.This is the kind of movie that most Americans probably would never see without the big names. But, the big names aren't what carry the film. The ensemble, which comprises the Grimley Colliery Band, is filled with very real types of people. You come to appreciate them, and fear for their well-being, as the British government seeks to close their mine.If you love music, you'll like it. If you're an anti-Tory, anti-Republican liberal, you'll like it. If you've ever been mercilessly laid off, you'll be able to relate. Just see the film!"
3,Haven't U ever heard of a...,"KILLER!!! I recently purchased this album and I really enjoyed it. Back when it dropped I always kept lookin over it because so much other stuff was consistaly dropping back then. RBX lyrically is a beast and to my surprise he kicks knowledge...I never took him for a ""message"" rapper. RBX Files has a Deathrow type production to it but in a twisted way. The album is dark and gritty with thumping bass lines.I haven't listened to the album but once so it may get better or worse but as of now I am comfortable with given it 2 1/2 to 3 stars..Hotep.P.S. My rating system works like this:1 star- Whack2 star- Average3 star- Above Average4 star- Real Good5 star- Classic"
5,Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Deep Fry Kit,"This is an awesome product, I love cast iron cookware and you can know it will work well or they replace it or try to fix it. I highly recommend Lodge Logic products! =)"
5,multi use,Shocked to find them. Our first one is 20 years old and wanted to have several for prep and trays. They are great to cut on the counter and no leakage! Great value.
2,Above Par,"All in all a brave concept, Allen manaages to pull it off somewhat. Unfortunately, the song and dance numbers seemed too numerous to allow the plot to move efficiently. Whenever the film needed to get on with the story, it would pause for a song break. Adding to the problems, Allen's screen partner Natasha Lyonne, who plays DJ, is not quite up to the challenge. I constantly found myself watching Natasha instead of DJ, and that spells trouble. Without plausible surroundings, one ends up realizing that they're watching Woody Allen instead of Joe, and that spells disaster. Still, the supporting performances were fine for the most part (especially Tim Roth and Alan Alda), and one must admire Allen for reaching back for a slice of a simpler, happier time. All in all, recommmendable, but certainly not among Allen's finer works."
4,Finally... a Musical!,"I haven't seen a new musical for a long time. I must say this flick was very enjoyable. The movie was over, and lo and behold I wasn't bored, irritated or sleepy. I agree with the comments about Woody's neurotic persona getting a bit tiring. Other than that this was a great movie. The musical scenes are very well done. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a light comedy and musicals."
3,Interesting book of magic,"Double-Yuck Magic was not a horrible book, but it definately could have been better. I realize it was written for elementary school kids, but even for that, it's not that great of a book. It has a nice story that shows a young girl discovering her magical abilities, and making mistakes along the way. In that regards it is better than most because it shows what happens when you abuse something that you have. It is good in the way it portrays Mathilda's desire for a dog."
2,The worst movie of the best book in The Barrytown Trilogy,"""The Van"" is one of my favorite books, but I really disliked this movie. So much of what made the book good is gone: for example, the character of Sharon could have been played by a cardboard cutout. Larry's family seems to have disappeared, and some of the funniest bits in the book (the death of the Jack Russell terrier, for instance) show up as unfunny sight gags. Do yourself a favor and read all of Roddy Doyle's books, and let this movie slide into oblivion."
3,Don't compare books and movies.,"This has got to be released on DVD. No question.It's part of a trilogy, it'll complete many Roddy Doyle fans collections and it is damn good!Some people have criticised the movie for not being as funny as the book -well duh! Books are almost always better, because you use your own imagination! Did Trainspotting live up to the book, not in my opinion -but millions still loved the movie.Forget those comments about not bothering with this movie, it carries on where The Snapper left off 3 years previously.If you liked The Snapper, do yourself a favour and get this movie when it goes to DVD."
2,Like eating bad chips,"Nowhere near as good as ""The Snapper"" or ""Commitments"". The humor is forced and not funny, and Colm Meaney's character comes off as small-minded, selfish and mean, while his friend is (literally, at one point) little better than a dribbling idiot. Not that there's anything wrong with that as such, but the whole thing is very 1-dimensional, there's no real story, and it gets tiresome after a while."
5,Good,"If you are currently unemployed, this is a great book. It is also good preparation if you think you might be laid off (or quit your job). The first part of the book is great and is right on target, showing that the author knows what he is talking about. Although the resume writing part is small and boring for those of us who keep our resumes updated, it is definitely good for people who have not updated theirs in years. Overall a very good book and an easy read."
3,Okay,"Not really what I was looking for, but it will suffice for now. Still had a hard time getting the jello out of this mold. This was the closest thing I could find to my mother's mold ring that was light green (actually found that at a thrift store)."
1,cast iron grill pan,"Not very happy with this purchase. Pan is hard to heat, smokes, and food sticks to the pan even though lightly sprayed with cooking oil. I thought this pan was pre seasoned as claimed. Save your money. It's certainly not worth the price."
1,THIS IS NOT NONSTICK!,"Upon receiving this grill/griddle, we proceeded to cook bacon the next morning. Using the current bacon press we have, the bacon stick terribly. It is also very hard to clean, still looks like there is food that will not come off. We have used many nonstick brands, some better that others and there biggest problem is that they scratch and don't last, but they are far better than this grill/griddle. The advertisement states that it is better that nonstick. Very false advertising as far as we are concerned!"
4,Does the job,"This instrument is decent. It is heavy and therefore I assume durable. I bought it for pancakes mostly. So, it cooks just about as many as we need, me and my gf. Sometimes I make breakfast and cooking in a pan seems to take forever, that is why we bought this. I do wish it was a little bigger, but I am not sure there is anything bigger out there. That and one more reason is why I gave a four instead of a five. The other reason is that the pan has a fat drain on the side and I thought that the pan itself was supposed to be tilted to facilitate the drainage. This doesn't happen. I have to say though that I have not cooked anything with much fat on it though so far. And I guess that if the tilt was too much that the pancake batter would spill over in to the drain. Anyways, I just thought that it would tilt a little more."
5,Love! Love! Love it!,I have just converted over to cast iron cookware and I have not regreated the switch from my Rivere Ware. Lodge is American made here in the USA. It isn't one of those cheap China knockoffs! The smooth side is great for eggs and pancakes. The Gill side is great for grilling meat or veggies and this side has a built in grease collector on one side so that the excess grease and etc. can drain off to the side. I love multi-purpose items! It is extremely easy to clean. I highly recommend this product.
3,Cast Iron grill/griddle,"I have other products from Lodge Logic and love them, but I was really disappointed with this one. I am yet to use it and not have my food stick and tear leaving big chunks on the grill. I usually spray it before using but to no avail. I believe there are a couple spots that were not done well when they ""fired it up"" in putting the coating on."
2,Buyer Beware - NOT pre-seasoned,"This is my first experience with Lodge brand cast iron and honestly, it's been a rough weekend! First of all be warned that contrary to what the box says, it is NOT pre-seasoned. I made the mistake of opening it up and immediately cooking bacon on this grill. Every piece of bacon was stuck!!! Two days later I am still scrubbing this thing like crazy to get the food off of it."
3,wasted space,"I was looking for a griddle and don't really care about a grill. A huge amount of space is lost to the grease gutter runoff system along the sides. You really only get about 9"" of cooking width. It's hard to see this from the pictures. I don't need a grease gutter to make pancakes, I need space! However, this is well made like all lodge cast iron."
4,Just the right size,We recently purchased a replacement gas stove and the one we chose had a large center burner for grilling so we searched the web for a cast iron griddle. This is the right size for such a purpose. The grill needed no treatment before using and clean up is simple. We like the two-sided unit because it serves dual purposes. I read other peoples reviews and many mentioned it's weight. They are right. It's heavy! Don't worry about it sliding around while being used. I'd reccomend this product.
5,Lodge Logic Pro 20-10-7/16-inch Cast Iron Grill/Griddle,"Always like Lodge. They make a great product! This griddle is just theright size. Can do up to six pancakes, also has a great grill on theother side to do grill fish or steaks. I also found that it is greatto use in oven when grilling lots of vegetables. This is a product thatyou will have many years. Also for those who don't like artificial coatingon pans, this is the grill and griddle for you. Just keep it oil afterwashing.B.Mcmenemie"
3,Disapointed,I am really disapointed with my griddle. Everything sticks on it. I wanted this so that I only had one utensil for cooking breakfast. My sausage sticks so do my eggs and pancakes. I dont know what I am doing wrong. I am still using it but just what I had expected.Cjenni
3,Beware - blemished model being sold.,While I love Lodge beware that the item I received was actually a blemished model. It had a big sticker on it that said it was blemished. There was one area with deep pitting . . .I took my sander to it so I could fix it but I shouldn't have to do that.
5,Lodge Logic cast iron grill /griddle (20by10-7/16 inch),My husband loves it. He cooks and he does the dishes when we go camping and he is very happy with this griddle.
3,Product is too heavy and larger than expected,"I am a strong 116 pound woman, and but product is a little bit too heavy for me to use on daily basises as I originally intended on using in my kitchen. Had any of the review mentioned the weight of this product, I would have recondisdered getting somthing smaller and less heavy. When I opened the product, I also noticed some minor surface color discolorations.My husband and I did enjoy the even cooking spread along the plate though."
5,Awesome and sturdy,Love this grill pan!!! So heavy lets you know that it is real and when it cooks up yummy!! I am looking forward to unlocking all of the wonderful taste that can only be found by using this grill
5,Simply a chefs best friend!,"I bought this griddle for 2 reasons. 1 it was a huge deal compared to the manufacturers real price which was 70 dollars compared to 35. I admit it is heavy but oh os worth it! I have never made such delicious pancakes or fish on the grill like this before! True u have to use it so the food doesnt stick but the more u use it the better it gets and best part was the shipping. I am cheap lol so i clicked on free shipping which said it would take 2 weeks to arrive, well it came in three days which was a huge surprise. All I can say about amazon and its eals r this Ebay, eat ur hert out lol Amazon is the place to shop and this grill is a work of art."
5,Terrific deal,Well worth the price. couldn't have gotten a better quality lodge for this price. shipped sooner than expected.
5,Doesn't Stick!,This product is very high quality. It represents the craftmanship of the last century. We have used it for 2 months now and we have not had anything stick! I would recommend this product to anyone.
2,Dissapointed.,"Just bought this item this week, was very excited about using it for the first time. Turned out to be a huge mess. The stove turned black right under the grill, it took like 20 min to clean it up, burned up mess. Also there there is soo much smoke coming from the grill I had to shut off the smoke detector for a while. Overall the food came out pretty good but the mess with the stove really upset me."
1,Logic cast iron grill,the is the worst cast iron pan I have ever had. It is hard to clean and it rusts easily. I followed all the directions and it still is awful. I would not recommend this to anyone.
4,better than most,I like this pan. perfectly fits my cook top.It does need to be seasoned eventhough it is supposed to be pre- seasoned the food stuck the first time I used it.
5,Its a shame I don't use it more,"I have a gas cooktop and like to grill meat and vegetables. Its a pain to start up the barbeque outside, waiting for coals... so this is the next best thing. Its double sided, one has a flat surface for pancakes, the other is a great griller for meats, veggies, etc. Its heavy and hard to find a spot to store it although it should be a permanent fixture on my cooktop."
1,The Real Story,"With the possible exception of Track 12 - Sick Punk (already recorded on another CD), this CD is nothing but tripe! This CD is full of painful ballads and horrible lyrics and deserves a negative rating if that were possible.I also considered Nuno one of the best (if not the best) guitarists in the world... but after this and his previous solo effort(s) (he's dressed as a girl on the cover on one CD), not to mention Mourning Widows, he's really lost whatever magic he once commanded. Sadly, at least Jason Becker had a good reason for his fade. He has set aside all that made him great - playing the guitar.As far as the other raters go - stop lying to the public! Nuno WAS one of the greatest guitarists, but that Nuno seems to be dead. Don't buy this CD without first hearing samples of the abysmal tracks first. Buyer beware!!!"
5,steamer,great product - bought three of them so far for self and giftsnice delivery time and price too
5,Love this thing!!,"It's so great, I bought two. Considering purchasing another.....Also, it's dishwasher safe, but so easy to clean by hand.If you have a hot water dispenser, use that in the b0ottom water compartment. LOTSof steam keeps the food moist, not dried out."
1,Doesn't fit properly,Doesn't fit on skillet . Seems to be a little to big in diameter . To sit securely on Lodge skillet I ordered with this. I ordered 8 inch skillet and lid and .It fits great.Edit: I ordered the chefs skillet this lid is made for the standard skillet. SKU L8SK3
4,Cast iron lid,This item was a perfect fit to replace the lid to my dutch-oven that had been lost over the years. I bought 2 inorder to have a lid for my cast iron pan also.
5,Better than College,"Mr. Cleaver's Book Immediate Fiction, did something for me that my entirefour years in a fiction writing program in college failed to do. It taughtme how to write fiction. The college classes that I took went on about howimage is everything. It is not. Plot is everything, but they never wentinto what a plot was. What is action? How does it affect your character? Mr.Cleaver's book teaches you how to write an action filled plot! Something youwon't get in college. I know."
3,this was ok,not the best and not the worst it kinda after reading it ==ur like i already know this -- so if your thinking about buyin belive me dont you already know what its gonna tell you
4,Introduction to dendrochonology,"This is a translation of the German original 'Der Jahrring' (1983). A very thorough introduction into dendrochronology, i.e. the science of dating objects, buildings, etc by determining when the wood was formed. A tree's growth reflects its circumstances: in a bad year a tree grows only a little (narrow growth ring), in a good year a lot (wide growth ring). A sufficiently long series of growth rings is unique and can be dated exactly. That is, in principle. There is slightly more to it, as this book explains in 276 richly illustrated pages (black&white photographs, line drawings, diagrams, etc)."
4,"Not quite Concrete Blonde, but good stuff.","This was the new group from former Concrete Blonde singer Johnette Napolitano in 1995. It came out the same year as her Vowel Movement collaboration, which is much more raw, punk almost. Both bands turned out to be a one-time thing. I often think of this as the great lost Concrete Blonde album, it's that good. This does contain a Roxy Music cover, and a song with Paul Westerberg. Johnette does her typical great job, and the music is mostly good, a few tracks real moving. Though this and VM are out of print, I would definitely check it out if your a fan of CB, and found it used somewhere."
4,"The follow up to 10,9,8..","Red Sails came marching in after the angry 10,9,8,,for some it was a little dark. In reality it led the Oils into commercial radio for the first time.It also came out the first time I saw the Oils live, November 1984. I was in Year 10 and it scared the hell out of me, not in fear but by how much everyone listened to Peter Garrett.Intelligent and eloquent he really made Australians think about where they were heading. It has everything, and really along with 10,9,8 is one of the better albums. Go on get it!"
2,Overproduced,"I would rate most Midnight Oil albums 5 stars. Not so this one. It has some good songs which are ruined by heavy-handed production in the studio and too much commercial slickness. Hello! Midnight Oil is a great band because of their raw rock sound coupled with savvy on-target political commentary. This album just does not work because the raw edge is gone, replaced with slickness that even veers into (somebody has to say it) disco influences on a couple of tracks. Only one great track - ""Best of Both Worlds"" - is up to the usual par one expects from the Oils."
4,A cute video for unicorn lovers everywhere,This is a 1980's classic. Recommended for little girls who like unicorns and rainbows. :)
4,Excellent for brushing up on spanish,"The author/editor made some good choices of stories and laid out the paragraphs well so that the left page lines up with the right, the words are sometimes changed from english to spanish in order to make it more conversational but the majority is a very close translation."
2,Wouldn't recommend.....,"Doesn't work well.....Cheaply built with cheap materials, to match the price.........guess it's true.........you get what you pay for........good thing I was just courious........"
2,Not so enchanting,"When I read the back cover, I was intrigued. It was fairly good until about 2/3 through. Then it just got completely ridiculous. There were some silly parts previously, but I could turn a blind eye. Many of the pun devices she used in the end completely turned me off. I will suspend reality to an extent, but it went a little far. Several other reviewer picked apart the same things I saw - pajamas, amulet, etc. - so I won't go into more specifics."
1,Handmade junk,"My sister gave this puzzle to my 3-year-old and within the first day the graphic was peeling off of at least half of the pieces under supervised use. I guess now ""hand-crafted"" is just marketing rhetoric."
4,hardy,"hardy wood materials, large pieces, great puzzle for kids. I would recommend this item to younger kids. My nephew is 3 and loved it. It reminded me of my puzzle like this when I was a kid."
5,Great puzzle,This was a gift for my two and a half year old grandson. He loves puzzles. This one was very colorful and fun for him.
4,Hilary and Bob's nice sound,"I liked when Hilary joined Fourplay for collaborations in the past. The music here is nice and her voice is pure. I really like if she would have had more of a jazzy sound to their musical selections. This release is a little heavy on the relationship/love songs, which are nice and have a pretty sound to them, I prefer the jazz sound. Maybe they will collaborate again on a jazz CD."
5,Lodge Cast Iron Camp Dutch Oven,Love the Dutch Oven. Was exactly what I ordered. Highly Recommend. Fast turnaround.
3,Bought as a gift,I bought this for my grandson for a Christmas present. He belongs to the Boy Scouts and sometimes cooks for his group when they are out camping.
5,Incredible dutch oven!,"This is one heck of a dutch oven.It's well made, and should last a lifetime. As with any cast iron cookware, you need to take care of it properly. Being pre-seasoned from the manufacturer was a nice touch, although I went ahead with the normal seasoning routine anyway before using it.If you have a dutch oven, you already know how much you can do with one. From cakes and pies, to chili, to deep frying it can do it all.This is one well made piece, and if you take care of it, it will take care of you."
5,who are you people???!!!,"What the heck!? Have I been seeing one-star ratings? Yes, and they are propostoruous. Don't listen to these people. Buy the album NOW"
2,Worst album so far,"Coming from a big eminem fan I expected this to be great, like his last 3 albums which seemed to progress in terms of quality. But as he was featured in songs with 50 cent and others before this album dropped, his lyrical delivery style or flow seemed to have changed, almost to a wanna be tupac style, almost whiney at times. Practically the only song that has a good flow from eminem on encore is ""Mockingbird"". If this cd has flows like that with the same exact beats I would easily rate it with 4 stars. ""Mosh"" is clearly the best track, which has a good flow, good beat, and good focus. Other than that song it seems repetitive. His chorus' are weak and corny and last too long. He obviously still possesses the same lyrical skills but this isn't a cd that you can love almost any track on (like the previous 3). Overall, you can look at this as a good cd but compared to his previous efforts it is definitely weak in comparison...by far"
3,Car Hop Costume for Girls,"The costume arrived on Halloween day - so perfect timing!! However, we ordered a size Medium and it was absolutely TINY for my 7 year old daughter. It was very cute but seemed to be a better fit for a toddler than a 6 or 7 year old."
5,I love it.,This book is phenomenal. It teaches you how to build and keep healthy relationships. I received it in a timely matter and I enjoy reading it.
5,8 Qt. Camp Dutch Oven,Great peice of workmanship..Many thanks for all the time and effort that went into the production of this sturdy cast iron cookware..
3,"Good, but not Great","I bought this after looking at all the reviews. For most cooking it does a fair job. Eggs, bacon and the like all cooked , providing that you wait for it the pan to heat to the right temp.I bought it mainly to cook crepes, Although a little big for them it did a good job. I found the handle unhandy to swirl the crepe mixture around when cooking them, since you need a potholder, or the like to hold it. If had to buy again, I would probably choose a small version of this item."
3,OK but not really preseasoned,This worked slightly better than a square griddle on my round burners but did not spread the heat as well as I had expected. The parts not directly on thye burner (electric) were not evenly heated although I waited plenty of time for that to happen. The preseasoning does not work that well and was a disappointment. Pancakes still stuck even though I oiled the griddle in addition to the preseasoning.
5,Great preseasoned griddle...,"The griddle arrived quickly and in good shape. The seasoning is just right, being ready for use immediately. If you are not accustomed to using cast iron, it takes a while to learn how to use it correctly. If you use electric burners, be sure to warm the griddle slowly and never use a high setting. I love how the griddle cooks evenly on its entire surface. I use very little oil, due the seasoning being naturally nonstick, and it will only get better with time."
4,Great!,We love this griddle! Have had no problems with it so far. Very easy to take care of and clean off.
5,Good deal even for picky people :),"Excellent product! Bought as a birthday gift for someone who is pretty picky about his cookware. He will only use cast iron. He loves it and uses it almost daily! Win! If you are looking for a fairly small, easy to use cast iron griddle to make pancakes and grilled cheese sandwiches, this is it!"
1,The one they forgot to season,"This pan is impossible to cook with unless you use a can of cooking spray, a tub of lard and some butter for good measure. I followed all the instructions to no avail. I'm feeding the birds with it."
5,Standby Griddle,"Bought as standby in case the Farberware Skillet was unable to take the Sear Heat.Thus, as yet unused, if necessary, it should be able to do the job."
5,cast iron griddle,Looks and works just like the one we used to have on the farm. Great product and a good price
1,I don't like it,"I got this product after seeing all the raving reviews. But I am disappointed as it is so heavy. Doesn't come with insulated handle. Had burnt my hand several times while cooking. I use this almost everyday, and everyday i think of changing it."
5,Just buy it.....,"Yes...just but it....you can't go wrong with this Griddle. I got mine on 01.31.2013 and I immediately made some paratha on it. It's easy to clean and moreover it's get hot very quickly including the handle so be very careful.For under $15 bucks with free shipping and made in USA, man I don't know what you're waiting for. Trust me, it's worth every penny to own this Griddle.Thank you"
4,Great!,"I also got the dutch oven set from Logic and I'm very happy with everything. I found that the pre-seasoning is starting to flake off in tiny bits, which I'm a little wary of. I would have preferred to season it myself, personally, and skip the flaking of the factory seasoning. I don't notice any taste and it's very little at a time, but still I don't like the idea of it in my food.Otherwise, I really like the cast iron. It is good quality and heats up fast, stays hot, and heats very evenly. The pre-seasoning allows me to use very little oil on it but still be non-stick. I use my stuff in the oven and on the stove top, and maybe in the summer I can use it on the barbecue too!"
5,lots of bang for the buck,great old school skillet..heavy and even heat. After a few uses it seasons n cleans easily. Just gotta wipe dry and put a sm bit of oil on before storing or there will be rust spots. Wish I had a horse n saddle to hang it off for a long ride Duke style.
2,NOT the stage musical at all,"I guess it is my own fault for not looking closer, but I wanted the original cast of the Sydney production of PRISCILLA and this is just the original ""disco hits"" packaged as ""the stage musical"" which is just not the same thing at all. I loved the show in Australia and wanted the cast CD. Beware if you are looking for AN ORIGINAL CAST CD. That said, it's a great 2-CD disco set and I use it a lot when I workout."
1,disappointing,Very disappointing.I just saw the show in London. It was a blast. The voices and the orchestra wereright on.This recording of the Original Australian Cast does not have the elan of the London show that I saw. It really comes out very flat. I hope the London cast will be better.
3,"Just ""okay""!!!!","I had very high hopes for this book after reading ""The China Garden"", but ""Mel"" was only okay. Yeah, it was quick, easy read, but it lacked depth & was a bit cheesy at times. It just didn't have that ""stay up all night reading it"" quality, which is what I look for. I am just disappointed with it & I wouldn't really recommend it, read ""The China Garden"" instead."
4,Tomb Raider improvement,"Thank God the memories of the old Tomb Raider games on the Playstation One are just that- memories! I HATED those games. Now, Lara Croft has arrived to the Playstation 2 and the graphics, action, and characters have ALL been improved. This is *so* much better than those old Tomb Raider games that it's not even funny. You have many weapons such as grenade launchers, assault rifles, and shotguns. Each weapon is a lot of fun, too. I love chasing and killing a guy named Takamoto. There's one REALLY hard part of the game where you have to kill a whole bunch of guards along the street while using the grappling hook. I always have trouble with this part.I think this game is good enough to say- Lara Croft is one fine, dangerous babe."
2,Short game,"When I first got this game I thought it was going to be as long and adventurous as Tomb Raider Angel of darkness. But it wasn't. The game is so easy,and it can be beaten in about a week depending on how long you play. Its a fun game but its way to short.I'm used to playing Tomb raider that are long and confusing,but you wont get it with this game."
3,Adventure in mediocrity...,"While i had fun playing this game, i didnt have THAT much fun.Everything in this game has been seen or done better before.The guns go 'pop' instead of 'boom' and feel grossly under powered. Especially when a panther or a human takes 15 bullets from point blank range...The jumping 'puzzles' are pretty fun though thanks to the games awesome controls. All of lady Lara's moves are simple to pull off. Though there are more worthless moves than useful ones. Whats the point of doing 5 cartwheels or doing a handstand on a ledge?Theres also a ton of different scenary and environments but sadly, they arent put to great use. They all look and play decent but nothing stands out or wows you.Tomb Raider Legend is a pretty decent game but its definitely not one of the 'must have' games of the year.If i were you i would wait until a price drop or simply rent it for a weekend because of its short, 6-8 hour, length."
5,Great Dutch Oven,"For those who have never cooked in a Dutch oven, it is wonderful. Dutch ovens are the most versatile cookware anywhere. I use mine camping, in back yard cookouts, and even in the kitchen, and have cooked everything from breads and pizza to ribs and casserole to cake and cobbler.Lodge is the only way to go for Dutch ovens. The finish is better than others I have used making cleanup much easier, and wall thickness is uniform so it cooks evenly. I have several Lodge Dutch ovens and they all perform great.I also have a cheap Chinese Dutch oven. The advantages of it are that it was cheap, and... hmm... did I mention that it was cheap? I rarely use it because it is so hard to clean. I only grab it if all my Lodges are in use.You pay more for a Lodge, but if you use your Dutch ovens for anything besides decoration, you will appreciate the quality Lodge delivers."
5,picnic cooking via Amazon purchase(fast delivery),"My husband loves the ease of use and the recipes are turning out great for our wooded camping area for the grandkids. They all tried breakfast, dinner & desserts. Now he uses my gas oven on rainy days!"
4,No more pampering of thugs!,"If you want to read the story behind the U.S. Sheriff with the highest approval rating, then this is the book for you. A man that has made being in jail exactly what it should be, a punishment, not a country club with cable t.v and nautilus. Sheriff Joe has sent out a clear and concise message, ""If you can't do the time, don't do the crime"" The Law abiding citizens of America salute you!"
3,Great keyboard at first but then...,"This keyboard worked great for the first 24 hours. Then it started having some kind of weird problem with windows xp. XP stopped functioning completely. I couldnt even get into Safe Mode. After unplugging this keyboard, all my problems went away instantly. I have no idea if its the keyboard or just my computer. Other then that, I think its a great buy. I like the layout of the board plus the function keys are cool."
1,Telly Savalas would not be pleased (1.5 stars),"A mediocre mess at best. I've heard the bonus CD on the Rhino reissue is good, but I'm not willing to subject myself to the original 'Kojak' again."
4,TurboTax Federal Home & Business,Seems to be just a little better than TaxCut which I've used for many years in the past. Interview format is good - overall easy to use.
2,Expensive Hidden Costs,Great software it gets to everything for you in a very ease of use processTurbotax Home & Bus TY06 with St No Backorders for This Item. Why the 2 stars? Well I used home and business for tax year 2006 for $80.00. Then they charge you 16.95 for each return (state and Federal). Well after paying those charges totaling $33.90 they give you this nice option of having them deduct the $33.90 from your return instead of using a credit card. Like a sucker I picked that option only to learn that for this process they charge you $29.99 to deduct $33.90 from your return.So total cost was$80.00 for the product$33.90 to e-file$29.99 to deduct the e-file fee from my returnTotal 143.89 that was to do the taxes myself....No thanks
3,Cute but ...,"This is probably the cutiest and the least used cast iron cookware in my collection. If you need to cook anything which requires stirring, this one is too small. There is too little room to toss and turn the food around. It maybe fine for heating soups and beans etc. but then its an overkill to buy something for just heating stuff. I often find myself using the 3 quart chicken frier a lot. Even if you make smaller quantities of food, you still need some room to maneuver."
2,StinkPot,"Lovely pot, but it smells terrible as soon as you get it hot. Sad, but it was more than we could handle. It has been returned to Amazon."
5,its so cute i wanna crawl inside and roast myself!,the best rice cooker ever. Stuffing is great baked in this dish. The best part is my drunken roomate cant destroy it! Its made too well. Thanks lodge! In your face drunken roomate!
3,Ultima Online,"Ultima Online used to be the best of the best, with great game mechanics and adventures that you will remember for years to come. However the game has gotten a total overhaul since the good days. They now have complex magical items and artifacts. Resists are no longer simple either, there are a large variety of them and some skills are now just plain pointless.UO used to be the best, now its on the verge of extinction (despite its steady, loyal fanbase). Another big problem with this product is the misleading label. It says that this is a DVD, when, in fact, it is a CD. I almost returned the item because of this, but figured it wouldn't matter. After returning to UO for the third time in its nearly ten year reign, I am done with the game.On a side note, I would love to see a revamped UO. It would be great if they brought all the old UO mechanics (pre-Trammel or pre-Mondain's Legacy) to a new, 3D game. Perhaps UO2? That would be wonderful."
1,Buy it elsewhere.,"While Ultima Online is one of my favorite wastes of time, and a very in-depth MMORPG, I have to give this particular purchase an incredibly crappy rating. ""Why?"", might you ask? Here's why... the manual inside has nothing but two blank, white boxes where the registration and upgrade codes should be. In other words, I've spent $24.97 for absolutely nothing, and EA's customer support has nothing helpful to offer. You can kill my character, steal my gold, even kill my character's puppy and that's fine... it's only a game. But take my money and give me essentially nothing in return? That's against the rules.If you plan on upgrading your account, do yourself a favor and buy it from your local video game retailer. That way, if your copy doesn't contain the codes you need, your refund is only a short drive away. While I do love Amazon and all the great buys it has to offer, I feel it's my civic duty to warn others about this crappy, crappy, CRAPPY piece of crappy crap. Thank you."
3,Alright,"Blizzard's Wake wasn't the best book that I have read, but I wouldn't say that it is horrible. I personally wouldn't recommend the book to anyone, but I also wouldn't say it was boring. I do like Phyllis Naylor, but this isn't one of her best books. This book, though, does have many examples of emotions and it also shows what certain emotions can do to a person. This book did make me feel glad that I'm not in this situation, and showed much emotion."
3,a challenging book,It was a very complicated book. It was about a guy that goes to jail because he was in a car accident with a lady. It starts where the guy gets out of jail. It was confusing because it goes from thing to another and back again. It wasn't the best book but it was o.k. I wanted to read it because the cover looked interesting. I wouldn't recomend the book to anyone that doesn't like challenges.
5,Tourist traps of the gods,"At first glance, this book is a simple travelogue of the Mediterranean (Rome, Greece, Egypt), but what makes the book really neat is that Perrottet decided to travel the same path trodden by ancient Roman tourists.He quotes liberally from old Roman tour guides and brings to life an ancient world of tourism surprisingly similar to ours. Obnoxious tour guides, hotel ranking systems, road maps, crappy souvenirs, tourist traps, and even the hassles of renting cars (wagons) are as old as the age of the Caesars. It is almost frightening how close our world is to the world of these Roman tourists. If you are into ancient history, travel, or any combination thereof, ""Route 66 AD"" is worth picking up. There not a dry passage in the book. Perrottet is an entertaining, informative and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny author."
5,Best on the Market,"The lightest most comfortable golf shoe I ever owned. I weigh about 250 and have worn them for months, still going strong."
1,It's a disappointment,"This one, from an accomplished and popular artist, is a disappointment. He seems caught up more in the harmonics of these tunes -- which are sadly similar to one another -- than he does in the rhythm. The result is clever chord changes without a steady tempo. Most disappointing is the audio quality. It's either his left hand on the frets or his right hand doing the plucking and strumming, but there are ugly squeaks that occur much too often, and it quickly becomes distracting. I'm a huge and steady Pizzarelli fan, of both Bucky and John, so this outing is saddening."
3,Nice kid's toy,"Definitely a kid's toy. Won't hold its tune at all. But, lets a child play with a guitar. Much better for a kid than one of those electronic guitars with buttons all over the place. This is at least a mock-up of a real instrument."
1,"Hello, JOE?","Which book are you reviewing? Your review sounds great, but has nothing to do with the book that I received in the mail. If I wanted a lengthy reference, I'd print out the DirectX SDK, not spend $40"
1,bait and switch,"I know it's rather dated now and there are lots of alternatives but it's so bad I just had to post. someone bought me this book a few years ago and I never really had enough time to read it. in the meantime I learned a lot about programming Windows GUI apps, and a smattering of OpenGL. recently I've had nothing to do so I picked the book back up.this book doesn't have any information about making games.the only way to learn how to program is to have some examples to look at. you can know all the theory of classes and objects, COM architecture, encapsulation, etc etc but if you don't have some actual code to look at your chances of writing an actual working program are nil.not to mention that I think focusing on graphics before you even know anything about the guts of the game is pretty stupid.There. venting over."
1,Waste of Time/Money,I was expecting working examples. As a video game developer I was sorely disappointed. I wish I could have seen the example code BEFORE I opened the CD. I with I could get my money back.
5,Jill D - TX,This THICK book is FANTASTIC! Is one of the BEST Self-Help books I have gotten! Very informative and exactly what I wanted & needed! Great Info!
4,Perfect gift for Tab Reader,"I bought this book and two others for my brother-in-law for his birthday. He is a tab reader, and said that what he liked most about this book and the others is that the chords are given on the first page of the piece, and which version of the chords are used for the piece - for those of you who don't play the guitar, this merely means that you can make the same chord by arranging your fingers in different ways on the guitar, and the book shows you the best one for the song. He told me that he can go over the cords before reading the tab and that makes it much easier for him, that extra prep before he gets into the song. From what he says, this is not common, but it is a plus for a tab style book which makes it a better purchase."
5,Outstanding!!!,"This book is captivating. I guarantee that once you pick this book up and begin to read it, you will not be able to put it down. The main character of this story helps the reader to understand that you must live with the choices you make. Don't miss an opportunity to read an awesome book that I'm sure you will talk about and learn from for years."
3,Seagal / Daemon = Action / Comedy / Buddy Movie,"This is by far one of the better movies that Seagal has been in, he even shows that he can act a little and there is comedy from Seagal's sidekick Daemon Wayans. This is a stereotypical buddy / action movie, with lots of explosions, fight scenes and 8 people going through windows. Even though it is a buddy movie, all of the time is spent on Seagal's character who is the Glimmer man, a detective who is a former killer who found peace and spirituality. If it sounds corny, it is the joke of the entire movie but Seagal gets the last laugh as usual beating up bad guys, doing comedy and throwing a few philosophical lines at the audience. Its not a bad movie, and it has a great running time of 92 minutes, because the action does get repetitive, especially the final fight scene, as the same kick is used a good 25 times against Seagal."
2,Needs work,"1. I didn't like how it fit on my ear.2. It died right after I got it. It charged fine at first, but then wouldn't charge - a common problem according to their tech support. The fix? Return it.It's cheap, possibly the cheapest bluetooth headset out there. You get what you pay for with this one."
5,A wonderful book,The pop up altars in this book are just amazingly detailed and so beautiful. I have given several of them away to friends who travel a lot as I thought it would be a nice portable altar while they were on the road. They were very well-received. I highly recommend this book.
4,One of the finest Rock bands ever.,"I maybe one of the few people in the US that has everyone of You Am I's albums. This is such a pity. They are one of the finest rock bands now or ever. #4 Record just confirms this. Great melodies and lyrics the whole package. On top of being a great album band they absolutely rock live. I had the pleasure of seeing them live in The Bottom Of The Hill Club in San Francisco, a tiny place where they were second on the bill. I am surprised the 3rd band even bothered to play. Probably the best gig I have ever been to."
2,A talkie!,"The print of this DVD-R is OK, though no subtitles, no extra features. The promoshots and posters of this Western promise a lot of action, but there a lot of talking, mainly by MacMurray. Only at the start and during the showdown there is brief action. The many (moralistic) dialogues in between (on one location) are irritating me, too much talk.My ratings: DVD: 3/5; plot: 2/5."
3,A Staple in my Kitchen,"I do really like these triangles. They are very useful and inexpensive. I wish they were a bit thicker, however. I do use them for 90% of my piping, however, they're too thin to use a coupler with without doubling up. Also, if left sitting too long, they will get soggy and burst when you go to squeeze them.However, if you have multiple tips and are working on a project at a good pace, it's far more affordable than using plastic bags and far easier than using canvas bags.I use these every time I decorate and een with their flaws, I will continue to use them."
3,Classic Bing,"This album is a prime example of Bing's wonderful talent. From his amazing voice to his humor, wit, and charm. All are showcased on this wonderful album. A true classic!"
4,Great game music,Rogue Galaxy is a rpg for the ps2 that had some extremely pretty background themes. Each world has 3 or 4 themes the cd places all the tracks for one planet together. There's 62 tracks consists of two cds and includes Rogue Galaxy's very beatiful theme song Dreaming my way home.
5,"GREAT, WONDERFUL",This is an awesome interview cd! It gives you a great insight into one of the year's hottest Brit bands. It is a must have for any Travis fan. Buy it now!
1,cheap metal broke within 50 uses,"that's just a guess but the thing looks spectacular and it took me along time to throw it away as I kept thinking the crack in the metal couldn't be so bad...but it only opened maybe 50 bottles of wine and then it snapped right off. Next time I will buy a really expensive one; right now it's back to the winged-supermarket variety which always works, though it hides in the draw instead of looking stylish on the bar."
2,too many birds!,"There are some nice frog sounds on this CD, but the red-winged blackbird noises are intrusive. They evoke a sunny daylight pond, rather than the dusky atmosphere I was hoping for. Even in the third track, which features a thunderstorm, the redwings are chirring away. They overshadow the frogs at times. Do birds even sing in the middle of thunderstorms? I'm starting to wonder if the recordings are authentic as presented, or whether the rain and birds/frogs were patched together at a later time."
5,Incredible art done with guitar and voice,I have listened to this album/CD since it was originally recorded. There is no equal to the work of this band when one looks at rock as art.
1,Not good enough,"What is new in this book? Unfortunately, not much. I bought this book from the recommendations on Amazon.com. What I was looking for is a fretboard trainer type of book, which would allow me to learn my fretboard thoroughly (as a type of exercise}. This book does not teach that. From my point of view, it would teach the reader to navigate the fretboard, but without improving your ability to read music and play it on the fretboard (How long can you fake being a musician without reading music?) ..."
3,It's not going to be easy,"Do not waste your money if you are not willing to put in a lot of time with this book. I am not that great a player and I am on the second page after 3 months..admittedly I haven't had much time to play..but let this serve as a warning, this book isn't for someone who isn't serious about learning how to play the guitar"
3,Don't use just this book,"I bought this book along with another basic music theory book. I find parts of it to be helpful - especially the second half. But, I am not sold on it. I really think that learning the theory first is important. Applying theory to guitar is the next step. I think that you will become a better musician if you work through applications on your own or with a good teacher. That way, alternate tunings will make sense and other instruments will make sense. Once you understand the theory, patterns will emerge and it will start making sense. This book makes a decent reference during that process, but it can also slow you down. At the price, however, it's probably not a waste - you should be able to find some insight that you can use."
5,buy this book u will not regret it !,"Ive been playing a long time, and i still buy referance material.Fretboard Logic is great wish I would have seen this when I started.It would have saved alot of frustration and time.At times it can be a little confusing for a beginner,but just read what is confusing you again and you will get it.This book simplifies the guitar much better than anything ive seen yet and it doesnt just use one style it covers them all.well worth the purchase, if your a beginner buy it, itermediate buy it this is a great referance to have around."
1,Disappointing,"I was disappointed by the lack of creativity brought to this expensive set of cd's. I'm sorry to say, ""Guided Mindfulness Meditation"" was silent, and slow going. Metaphors, stories, nuggets, and music were missing. My first purchase of Dr. Kabat-Zinn's work was the audiotape, ""Wherever You Go There You Are"". Dr. Kabat-Zinn did a great job here through his use of voice, music, and text. He was able to transport me to a peaceful state, his soothing voice lyrically illustrating relaxation metaphors. Soothing music was the backdrop for his interesting approach mixing together fact and story. I was hoping ""Guided Mindfullness Meditation"" would be just as inviting."
4,A good way to approach relaxation and meditation,"These guided meditations, relaxations and yoga routines were designed for use in Kabat-Zinn's stress-reduction clinic, and ""go along with"" his book Full Catastrophe Living. It contains four programs: a guided body scan relaxation (great), a guided sitting meditation (at over 35 minutes, this might be a bit long for beginners), and two gentle guided yoga routines.My only gripe is that the programs are pretty long (especially the sitting meditation), and they might not appeal to beginners. But the programs are excellent. Do understand that this is not only meditation, as the title suggests; it is also relaxation, and the 45-minute full body scan is probably worth the price of the set."
5,How do I order a copy for my son?,I am trying to place a reorder to be shipped to my son as I feel that he would like/benefit from it and I cannot find it again on Amazon. HELP!
1,I was not happy with this product,"The product came without any instructions, I had trouble playing it from the first, and eventually trashed it."
3,Awesome,This is a large towel and it looks just as it was pictured. Great for the pool or the beach. A great gift for any Bama fan.
3,A Nice but not a Great paper doll book,"Mattox's rendering of the classic Austen characters is helpful for English teachers and probably appealing to many Janeites, but Mattox is not Tom Tierney, and her drawings lack the bold lines and aesthetic superiority of his work. While I would like to see more paper doll collections illustrating literary works, I wish that they could all be as lovely and artistic as the books by Tierney. Mattox is GOOD, but she isn't GREAT, and on that level this book was something of a disappointment to me."
4,Regency clothing,"With the ongoing popularity of the works of Jane Austen, this paper-doll book should be one of Dover's best-selling examples of the type. It includes Elizabeth, Jane, and Lydia Bennett and their mother, Mr. Darcy and his formidable aunt Lady Catherine deBurgh, and his fellow-suitors Mr. Bingley and Mr. Wickham, along with 13 plates of clothes (48 outfits altogether) of the era c. 1796-1804 (Austen never exactly specified when her story was happening) to dress them in. Sunday gowns, party dresses, clothes for riding, visiting, at-home days, walking and travelling are included, with knee-breeches and full-length trousers for the men, high-waisted gowns and fanciful bonnets and hats for the ladies. This broad scope and the fact that the characters, while comfortable, aren't fantastically rich, should help purchasers get a handle on how the generality of English folk might have dressed at the time."
4,Filter,"I want to protect my lens. While not the most expensive, the Canon is adequate for what I need"
1,Bad Quanlity,I couldn't believe I bought such item from amazon. I am really disappointed. It's the worst item i ever buy from online. I want rate this item with ZERO star.
1,Major Disappointment,"I had heard nothing but wonderful things about Dogville so I was excited to rent it. Then it started. I hadn't heard *anything* about it being a movie about a play. That in itself is disappointing. I wanted a movie, not a play. Then there was the ""Master Of The Obvious"" narration. I thought it too distracting, and annoying because I was trying to concentrate on the characters and the story. Especially the excellent interactions between Grace and Tom. The narration kept butting in telling you what you obviously could tell what was going on. I also did not enjoy the camera work. The shakiness was a little dizzying. Because of all these factors, I couldn't last more than half an hour."
1,A lot of nonsense on non sets,"I give the director credit for trying something new. On the other hand, he could not have told the absurd story in a realistic setting. Without the artificiality of the non sets, no one would believe or accept what he had to say. The casting and acting were quite good, however. I am tempted to give the movie another star for that reason but I am too repulsed by the bleak vision of humanity presented here. The moral of the story can only be that if given power over another person, anyone will ferociously use and abuse that person. In this crowd, even the upright philosopher of the group was easily corrupted, while the Kidman character, who was portrayed as a kind of saint full of forgiveness, joined them in their depravity when she got the power. Sorry, this terrible tale has no relationship to the world I live in. I do wish critics would stop automatically anointing all stories of human degradation as art. After watching this one, I felt like I needed a long shower."
1,$4.00 down the drain,"I hate renting movies--and realizing they're not very good when they're over--but this was even worse--I couldn't even watch more than the first 30 minutes--and ten minutes into this movie I knew I'd thrown my money away. Pretentious in an artsy fartsy way--boring and in my opinion very amatuerish--most high school stage productions have superior props. (oh yeah-I guess that was intentional-there should have been a warning on this dvd-all scenes are filmed like a rehearsal)Can't say much about the story line-since I (and those I was watching this with) decided we just couldn't take any more of it-but if this was supposed to be interesting-I think I'd rather watch a spider spin a web!""Stepford Wives"", ""Dogville"" and ""Birth""--is Nicole on a losing streak or what?"
4,Ideological Bias,"First, I do agree with some of the reviewers that criticized director's point of view. However, the opposition should not be silenced, and if this is the way Von Trier imagines the social interactions so be it. On the artistic level this film works fairly well. Barely present scenery in function of revealing dark secrets of life in a small town (Twin Peaks, anyone?). Deux at machina resolution as the well worked out ending to the, essentially, tragic play. Overall atmosphere of bleaknees contributes well to the artistic intent.To sum up, I don't think it's fair to disregard this movie on the ideological ground."
1,There is a difference between Cinema and Theater!,"There are no words to describe how AWFUL (!!!) this ""movie"" was from beginning to end, but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined: Set up as a theater play more than a conventional movie, the film tries to capitalize on Nicole Kidman, who is without a doubt one of today's biggest and most talented stars! The movie, however, is ""different"" just for the sake of being different; nothing more/nothing less! One wonders how did this film win ANY awards apart from ""worst movie of the year!"" Rent or buy at own risk. You have been warned!"
3,Acer Laptop (needs more memory),"Very light laptop - nice to carry around. However, it runs way too slow under Vista with 512MB RAM. It runs very well using Windows XP but if you keep VISTA on it, you will NEED to put in at least another 512 MB RAM"
2,What is he talking about,Jeff Robinson writes with absolutely no regard for the reader. He does a poor job relaying the complicated details of the various money laundering schemes and relationships detailed in the book. You need a diagram to keep up with all the various characters he introduces. I recommend that you look elsewhere.
4,Fun Album for Cheese Lovers,"Linnea Handberg is the secret artist behind this project. She has great mainstream music as well at www.linneahandberg.com. Check it out!Linnea's voice, like a Papaya, is very sweet in this record and quite altered sounding. The songs are cheesy but fun, and to me, got a little too repetitive compared to other Bubblegum albums. However the album grew on me. The Cinderella song is the best in my opinion, although Hero is also very great, especially for DDR fans. I have to say the Party Song is one of the worst songs I've ever heard. It's in the typical Euro Reggae style. The Ballad is nice.If you like Bubblegum, you'll like it. If you don't, you probably won't."
4,Pfattzgraff Naturewood Accent,Bought dishes for daughter as a gift. All arrived safely in good condition and within the expected timeframe.
2,Will damage your body,"If you ignore all the book says about posture, actually this book is very good. It has good explanations of each concept. Much in the style of Kujulas book 'the flutists progress'. The only difference is that the posture the author advises the student do will damage the back, cause RSI in the pinky finger. as well as put the rest of the body under undue tension.If you as a student don't want to ever practise more than 15 minutes a day, then it won't matter. However, students who use this posture, but go on to levels where they need to practise for 3 hours a day, will find themselves very damaged. This is a very common problem among conservatorium students. The rest of the book is useful for the beginner to feel in control of his learning."
2,Does not last.,"This item is advertised as having a seven year life span. Mine signals the ""end of life"" for the unit by chirping every 30 seconds, even after replacing back-up battery. It is less than three years old, which is less then half as long as it is supposed to last."
1,Not worth the time or mony....,I purchased 3 of these units and took all three back because the battery doesn't fit properly. The units either don't detect anything or they start chirping after being plugged in after 9 hours. Not worth the time or money.I wouldn't even give it one star but I had to in order to write this review.
1,over-irritated,"I have to put my opinion out there since I feel others could benefit from it. I did not like this selection at all. I feel that Selke has a narrow view of what must turn her on and she insits upon limiting this book to only those sories. If you are her twin the book is great, but if you aren't then beware that this might not be your monies worth.I guess that is always a chance you take with an anthology - but I thought that maybe Lori Selke could redeem her value in the literary world as an editor with this one. Guess not."
4,excellent value for $15,"I picked up a couple of the 3 quart pans from Amazon for $15 each. These are a great value at this price. The pans are lighter weight than some of my other pans, but the build quality is very good and I was expecting much less for this price. The $50 retail price is too much for this quality of pan, but you can't go wrong for $15."
5,A PERFECT PAN!,"WELL MADE, SERVES MANY PURPOSES. HAS HELD UP WELL.SUBSTANTIAL WITHOUT BEING TOOHEAVY. THE GLASS TOP IS USEFUL. THE HANDLE DOES NOT GET HOT. CLEANS UP NICELY EACHTIME."
1,This is a badly made lot! Defective--beware.,I ordered both the 2Qt and 3QT of this non-stick pot by Cuisinart. There is a serious quality control issue. Neither of the lids (especially the 3 QT) fit the pot. It was as though either the pot or lid were warped. Aamazon better look at the invemtory as I own a lots of product by Cuisinart and have NEVER seen anything like this.
3,Works well,The pan works well and does a good job when I want to cook different types of soups. It's not too heavy and I like it overall.
3,Would be nice if the lid fit...,"It's a lovely, heavy pan. However, the lid does not fit. I ordered this through ""Best Overstocks"" seller and will not use them again. Not only was the order eight days past ""latest arrival date"" but when I contacted the seller they never bothered to reply. To add insult to injury, two of the three pots in the order are warped so that the lids do not fit. Amazon's A-Z Guarantee refunded only the shipping."
2,"An okay pan, but the lid could fit a little better","The glass lid could be just a little bit bigger - say about a couple of millimeters. It fits inside the pan's rim, but it kind of rattles around in there. There isn't a gasket or seal between the glass and the metal rim, so condensation can leak on a counter or stove when the lid is inverted. Kind of a nuisance.Aside from the lid, one gets the impression that it's a pan with acceptable quality.To give you an idea of the capacity, the pan will hold two 15 oz. cans of vegetables.SEVEN MONTHS LATER: a little of the nonstick coating has come loose, and I'm tired of the lid. This is not a quality pan. I just ordered this:Calphalon Contemporary Nonstick 1-1/2-Quart Saucepan with Glass Lid."
2,Better off with a non-fire fighter's nozzle,"If you want a sturdy and robust nozzle that has a high flow rate, this one is for you. It will fill a pail quicker than other non-fire fighters nozzles.If you want to have a higher pressure jet stream spray, then don't spend your money on this nozzle. You are better off with a less expensive quality rubber covered brass pistol grip nozzle."
2,My kingdom for an editor!,"I bought this on Kindle, so I expect errors in punctuation and such, but this one suffered from far more than just punctuation issues. It gave me a headache trying to follow the story -- clearly it was not edited for continuity! Not one of the better books out there."
3,A promising start,"Sallis writes beautifully. His turns of phrase are striking and evocative. His style reminds me James Lee Burke.But the segues into painful past experiences of both Turner and his former patients that do nothing to inform the overall story - his editor did him no favors leaving them in.While, in that sense, I want less, I also need a little more. Why did Turner go to prison for 11 years? How did he become a therapist? Most importantly, where's the third act of t his story? It ends with the second. There better be a sequel, and FAST - or he's lost a reader."
1,Cracked Bowls- Not Diswasher Safe???,"We purchased one of these bowls with the understanding that they were a quality product that would provide years of use. We were disappointed when our first bowl developed a crack from rim to base within the first three years of use. Fortunately, the bowl was replaced under warranty. We chalked that up to a manufacturing defect. Now the replacement bowl has cracked in the same manner and the distributer has said too bad for you.We used the bowls regularly for serving salads and it was not abused in any way. Although we did clean them in our dishwasher set at its highest level. The manufacturer claims they are the same as their oven-ready products but from our experience I believe they are much more fragile.They are a pretty bowl but I'd never recommend them to anyone."
1,Terrible,"I got into a phase of reading Old West history and biographies. This is not only one of the worst Old West books I have read but this is probably the worst book I have ever read. Earlier I posted two negative reviews of this book but curiously Amazon.Com took them down.This book claims to be a novel. What it really seems to be is a carelessly written, poorly researched history; I guess the logic is then to call it fiction (a novel) so it cannot be criticized as a carelessly written, poorly researched history. I believe that the book contains poor typography, poor grammar, and 'historical errors', but since it is called fiction, I guess the author is off the hook for historical or factual errors.If you are interested in Old West history or biographies of Old West characters like Doc Holliday, do not waste money on this trash - get a book published by a university press."
3,From Childhood to Adulthood,Here is a man that is torn between two worlds. One world offers him family and the other offers him the power of owning a powerful business. For someone ordinary without clear thinking will chose just one and make that one choice work for them no matter what. But here is John he is a smart one he chooses both worlds and finds happiness in both worlds.
2,After Two Months,"I am very disappointed with this product. Almost everything sticks to it, especially eggs, which is what I bought it for."
5,Very nice - Great Value,Being an all-clad snob until the non-stick coating came off. Then I tried this after reading a review in Cook's Illustrated. They hit it right on the head. Great value. Non stick is going to get dinged so dont spend a lot. Nice heat balance and easy weight.
4,A great deal for a large pan,"The only thing bad about the frying pan was the size, a little larger than is practical for most applications. The construction, match to others I have from this set and price were absolutely fantastic. If your stove can handle it, it is a great addition to the basic Cuisinart set."
1,"""Made in China ""- phobic !","""Made in China"", need more be said? Just got this today and I'm sending this back to Amazon. I'm afraid to use it, nothing in product description noted the ""Made in China"" label. Has not been 'recalled'...yet...""News of unsafe products infiltrating the American marketplace is becoming all too familiar,"" said Representative Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. ""It's clear that our consumer-product safety net has a hole in it the size of China.'' I don't want to find out 'too late' what has flaked off into my food."
3,Slightly Warped,I have a flat top stove and I have a hard time finding an affordable skillet that won't warp. This skillet warped as soon as medium heat was applied to it. It's only slightly warped and still works ok but I won't be buying another one.
4,don't go overboard on all-clad... this is just as good,"If All-Clad is 5 star, then this is 4 1/2... at about half the cost. Unless you need the name brand hanging in your kitchen, try this out first. Having worked in a professional kitchen with the real deal, it's tough to tell the Cusi from the gold standard. Great pans, just need to find how to get the covers. Try the stainless 12-inch too to make a set of great, cheap pans."
4,great size.,"perfect size for eggs and one-person dishes. the rivets are a little annoying but thereis no other way to have a handle attached and make it sturdy. it is a little lightweight.if you want the best, get Anolon. not much more money."
4,Cheap but superb pepper,"Tellicherry Pepper at this price is remarkable. The product is excellent, if a little difficult to pour from the large ""mouth"" into a small grinder. Otherwise, great!"
3,Help choosing the right aircraft,"For many of us, shopping for our first airplane is something of an alien experience. Since the average age of the private aircraft is over 20 years old, there are many considerations, and it is easy to second guess yourself. To help with my journey on the road to finding the perfect first aircraft, I purchased almost every book I could find on the subject. Scott Smith's book was one of the many.This six chapter, 126-page book contains many black in white photographs. While this text will not teach you everything you need to know about buying an aircraft, but it does feature photographs of various aircraft, covers cost, hidden costs, and will help you to narrow your search to the right kind of aircraft for you."
3,not as good as the stone,still great trance music from babble. the first half of the album reminds you why....then the last half seems to re-churn some of the previous beats. very worth a listen if you like babble's music..just dont pay too much.
1,Sony Lens,"Bought these specifically for my Sony Camera, used the search engine to find one to match my camera. I ordered it at a fair price, received it quickly. BUT buyer beware, my camera instructions says to read the instructions with the new lens, there were no instructions and only one lens fits my camera, what a waste of money."
3,Good Ghost Stories,"I actually picked this booklet up in Harper's Ferry for much less than the price here.It is illustrated with drawings by Suzanne Randell and looks to be something put together very cheaply.I did enjoy reading the ghost stories and admit to getting a few chills especially having visited the town several times.This booklet is worth a read, but not for the price shown here."
5,Real Quality!,"It was time to replace my 10"" Craftsman (best suited for cutting cardboard). JET band saws were rated the best choice at several online reviews. Friends who do similar woodworking have 12"" Delta's and both agreed that getting a saw that would take a 1/2"" blade is critical (their Delta won't). This 12"" JET goes upto 1/2"", changing blades and adjusting is a breeze. It's also much heavier (solid cast iron housing and table)which helps reduce vibration. It's MUCH quieter than my old Craftsman. Assembley and adjustment took me 1.5 hours (by myself). Documentation was excellent. Too bad they don't include a miter gauge and light. Overall I feel this is a much better saw than Delta."
5,The Essential Jim Reeves,I have listened to this Album over and over again since I received it. I have thouroughly enjoyed his music and intend to buy some more albums.
3,Nice little radio,As I said in the title it is a very nice little weather radio. Works well and the price cannot be beat.
5,search no more,Looking for God is like a religious dictionary. What's more you really get a feel of the author's direct experience completely unbiased.
1,The soundtrack was terrible.,A majority of the songs are one's I have never even heard on the radio. I would definately bet on these songs never being placed on a top 50's list. This soundtrack was not even worth it.
5,Great Condition- Mint Condition,"I received my CD in a very timely fashion, I was also grateful for the packaging, which kept the CD from any scratches on the outside of the album. The CD was without any scratches, completly new and unused with the clear tape still on. The music was clear as water, too. Thank you very much for this quality product!"
1,Terrible video quality.,"Maybe it's because I'm naive, but I keep ordering VHS tapes hoping I'll maybe discover some unappreciated gem. The image quality is blurry. Don't these people making the transfers have any pride at all? Seems not..."
5,great read!!!,This is an excellent true crime book!!! The author has really done his homework. It goes into all of the murderers past relationships. I would highly recommend it. I have to say I almost did not buy it because of the reviews on amazon. I don't know if these reviewers were reading the same book!!
3,A Different Kind of Movie..,"A Vietnam War movie, with Donovan doing the soundtrack. There are only two songs in the movie, and he does both. At the very beginning and during the ending credits, a weird version of ""To Susan on the West Coast Waiting"" plays, and sometime in the middle, the squad manages to hear ""Catch the Wind"" on their radio.Kind of a weird movie, done the same way that ""Blair Witch Project"" was done, with a film camera documenting all that happens, except that this documents a squad in Vietnam, and not an expedition of discovery.There doesn't seem to be any kind of central plot, really, just several days in the life of a squad in the jungles of Vietnam. A very unusual movie, but still good."
5,Concise wisdom,"I found ""Thinking from A to Z"" to be a concise, and well laid-out explanation of the logical terms in classical arguments. It paid off handsomely in a recent college class, providing explanations for each of the classical elements of logical argumental."
2,SAINTS & SINNERS,"THIS IS A WHITESNAKE ALBUM FROM EARLY IN THEIR CAREER, THIS CD CONTAINS THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF ""HERE I GO AGAIN"" AND A FEW OTHER FAIRLY GOOD TRACKS, BUT IT LACKS THE POLISH AND GUITAR RIFFS OF THEIR LATER ALBUMSRANDY"
4,"Strong,underrated album","Original versions of Crying in the Rain+Here I go Again are light years better than the Whitesnake album recuts.Basic ""Go for the Gut"" Rock-n-Roll."
5,The Last Jews in Berlin: Purchased at Amazon.com,"The Last Jews in Berlin is just that, a story of a few very brave men and women hiding in Berlin from the Gestapo. This is an absolutely thrilling book which shows what a human being will go through in order to survive. The time frame is mostly from 1942 through 1945. As awful as the whole Nazi regime was, it was so uplifting to read of some of the very few Germans that helped out some of the Jews in some way. In a small way it restored your faith in humanity. A great book that I highly recommend."
3,"Good guide, some information dated.",I've always enjoyed the eclectic nature of Moon guides and the Florida Gulf Coast guide is no exception. In hind sight I should have looked for an everglades guide but this one sufficed. A lot of the information is now dated because the last year's hurricane season. the biggest problem I ran into was places either being closed or having reduced hours. I also found the organization of the Everglades informations a bit scattered. Still I'd recommend this guide.
3,Devoces amd Desores,Lost some interest halfway through the book. Found myself skipping pages as I seemed to loose interest in some the details
1,The worst HRM I've ever used.,"I am college educated, and for me this was very hard to program. Following the manual, the functions did not do what the manual said they would do. I had to forget the manual and try to figure it out myself. Also, which is just as much my fault, the buttons are on the left of the watch, making it extremely difficult for right-handed people to switch between modes while on the go. I am disappointed in this product. I don't think they tested it out before they put it on the market."
5,Armed and ready,"All brass, easy to install. Use teflon tape. Don't over tighten. We use it with a heavy movable shower head and it works great."
5,FABULOUS BOOK ON BROADWAY,"This is a one of a kind Broadway book. The stories, the photos, the whole feel . . .it is like table hopping at Sardi's."
2,"Good movie, bad format","For the content of the movie I give it four stars. However, this is a 4x3 cropped version. This appears to be the only format it is available in, so no blame to Amz."
4,A Guy Called Gerald - To All Things What They Need,"As one of the progenitors of modern techno, you have to give Gerald Simpson (better known as A Guy Called Gerald) his due. So as _To All Things What They Need_ starts off on an ambient notes of ""American Cars,"" Simpson moves into a restless, genre-hopping album. From the electro fo ""To Love"" to the downtempo, spoken word ""Millennium Sanhedrin"" (with Ursula Rucker, of course), Simpson slides easily from one style to the next. A muezzin takes center stage in the Middle Eastern-influenced ""Call For Prayer"" while ""Tajeen"" spices the pot with with ethnic electro. ""First Try"" is a beautiful, swirling, string-laden piece of acid, while ""Pump"" is a straight-up house jam. Even if the groundbreaking part of his career has passed, he can still bring out the best of the machines."
5,A Great Sports Nutrition Reference,Athletes of all kinds will learn the importance of diet for their sport. There are also sample menus to help you learn how to plan your meals.
2,"Good for the neophyte, nothing new","This is a good book to have if you know nothing about nutrition and want to learn some of the basics. You can collect all the basic information here through general Internet research. True, it's nice to have it all in one place in a logical format, but I really expected much more detailed advice for a book targeted specifically to endurance athletes than 'you need to manage your carbohydrates over the length of the event'-type advice. Not worth the money in my opinion."
5,I DARE YOU TO READ THIS BOOK AND NOT GET HOOKED ON DUMAS,"This is by far one of the best (if not the best) books ever written. The First in a Series of Five (The Three Musketeers, Twenty Years After, The Viscount of Bragelonne, Louise de la Vallere, and The Man in the Iron Mask) Dumas does an incredible job of bringing you into his world of Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artangan. Good for all ages and great for the adventerous. This book is a page turner. Certainly the best in the series. I highly recommend this book to anyone who dares to get hooked on Dumas."
4,More nuanced than I expected,"Thanks primarily to Hollywood, I always thought ""The Three Musketeers"" was simply an action story with a lot of swordplay and lusty carrying-on. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it had an intriguing plot, that it actually had some basis in history, and that the characters were mostly well crafted, especially that of Milady. I must say that, for me, French Romanticism is an acquired taste and I was turned off by the exagerations that Romantic works put forth. The plot was very intricate and, although it depended on so much coincidence as required by its genre, it all worked well. The test of a book for me is: did I become engrossed in it. The answer for the Three Musketeers is yes, at least most of the time. A worthy read."
1,"An overpriced, unremarkable edition of this fine work","One would think, based on the price of this ""limited edition"" publication, that this would be an elegant and well produced hard-cover edition. What I discovered on delivery is that this is a truly plain-jane publication: no foreword, no introduction, no mention of who translated this edition, no dust cover and so on and so on. Save your money, and don't order this edition. This is a great story, and it deserves a better treatment."
4,The Three Musketeers..new translation,A good treatment with a modern translation but the book is LARGE.
4,4 Stars...,"It had a great plot and great characters (especially Milady), but it was difficult to understand because of the many French words used. If your not fluet in French keep a French/English dictionary on hand."
2,Oldie but not a goody.,I read old books but the language and writing in this book left me finding it weak and slow. I had hoped for better.
3,Have a dictionary handy when reading this book,This book was one of our Book Club reads. I probably would not have gotten through 700 + pages without the reader. I enjoyed the story but really had to concentrate.
1,Whitesnake come and get it,"I purchased this cd from the ratings it got, very blues/rock oriented, the best Whitesnake album they ever did, WROOONG, I have been a straight up blues, blues/rock, 80's metal, heavy metal fan for thirty some odd years and this cd is as far away from any kind of blues/rock as it gets. I usually can find two or three killer tunes on even the worst cd but I gotta tell ya, this cd is one of the worst I have purchased in a long time, I might just throw it in the trash, theres not one decent song on the entire cd, It STINKS !! It sounds like one of those contract albums they needed to make and threw together 13 really bad, uninspired songs to fufill their agreement. Buyer beware, this cd is awful !!!"
3,por terminar...,"Al principio la historia se me hizo algo larga, pero luego mejoro... no lo suficiente pero mejoro, no soy un lector entusiasta, pero esta novela me invita a terminarla.Hay que tener en cuenta que aun cuando esta novela esta basada en un personaje real, muchos de los eventos fueron unidos con otros nacidos de la fantasía, en ocasiones increíbles pero que le dan algo de color y romance a la historia."
4,"Excellent story, character development before your very eyes","I really enjoyed this book. In my opinion Myers best work. It has more action than Silverlock, and again detailed the transformation of a louse into a man. The book takes place in Celtic Europe, and talks about life and how individuals affect the events that eventually shape the way the world changes."
4,A gem!,"Here an almost perfect cast was chosen to record one of Verdi's greatest operas! The Voce Verdiana, Carlo Bergonzi, sings a most beautiful Don Carlo, the mature Renata Tebaldi sings a ravishing Elisabetta (except some tiny insecurities, how glorious she could have been 10 years earlier!), Grace Bumbry breathes fire as Eboli and Nicolai Ghiaurov offers his best Filippo ever. The low point is Fischer-Dieskau's Rodrigo, hardly idiomatic. Still, a must for Verdi-lovers!"
2,Good for the time,"This album was a rush job when Campell left for Whitesnake.Good guitar solos, lots of FILLER songs,sounds DATED.LOck up the Wolves was better."
2,Just Terrible,"Dio's last album with Vivian Campbell. Great vocals but just terrible lyrics and the guitar work just doesn't measure up. This is where Dio's mystery lyrics get just downright annoying: meaningless and generic. 'Last In Line' is the last good album Dio made: avoid 'Sacred Heart' and everything released afterwards as it just doesn't measure up in music and the 'magic' lyrics just get cheesier and cheesier. Dio's best stuff is with Sabbath and Rainbow really. He also did two great tracks with Kerry Livgren on 'Seeds of Change': 'Living for the King' and 'Mask of the Great Deceiver.' That's something you wont hear anywhere else, Dio singing Christian rock!"
2,JUST A FILLER....,"This album is just a filler in Dio's amazing discography...AFter ""HOly Diver"" it was hard to keep the pace, but he almost did that in ""Last in Line"". LAter, guitarrist Vivian Campbell left the band and Dio started a perigrination through an amazing number of different guitarrists."
3,Pedestrian Dio album...,"Hi- this ones' not the place to start with Dio. The vocals and musicianship are fantastic as always, but the tunes are rote, lacking spark and imagination, not to mention the lack of killer hooks. Also, this cd really needs a remastering job- the sound is fuzzy, grainy and distorted- making this album sound older than it could. Dio has made some great heavy rock over the years- his powerful metal voice, stick it to 'em attitude and fantastical lyrics have made him many fans. Start with Rising, by the band Rainbow, Heaven and Hell by Black Sabbath, or Holy Diver or Dream Evil by Dio for examples of this man's best.Cheers!"
5,Can not be missed!,"This Anthology is one that anyone can not afford to miss. Whether you are a life long Beatlemaniac, or a second generation fanatic, this rockumentary is the best for any information of the Fab Four!"
3,Why has nobody mentioned the HORRIBLE picture quality?,"This documentary is essential for Beatles fans, especially for the large amount of live footage from the early discs.But as I've watched this set, I am constantly stunned by the unbelieveably poor quality of the digital video in scene after scene. The picture constantly looks like some medium-quality JPEG on my computer (even though I'm watching it on a large TV screen). I'm not talking about the fact that the video is taken from decades-old film sources; there are clear, obvious digital artifacts in scene after scene (and, to a lesser degree, in the 90s interview footage). Given that there is less than 2 1/2 hours of content on each disc, it seems like they could have used better compression on this material and presented it as clearly as possible.This set contains unquestionably the worst DVD image quality in my collection."
3,Will not purchase another pair,"Been wearing these pants for over two years now and have not been very impressed. I love the lightweight material and the fact that these are convertible, but the cargo pockets are flimsy and the Velcro has worn out to the point where any heavier items, like a leatherman, will make the pockets impossible to close. I've lost a good multitool and a zippo out of these pockets. The built-in belt is comfortable with a backpack, but it will not stay tightened and it makes it impossible to hang tools off a belt. I tore the seam in the seat while rock climbing and the seam in the crotch is starting to go. If you need a comfortable, light duty pant for backpacking or traveling, buy these. If you are looking for something to climb, trek, bushwack, or work in, keep looking."
5,A great help,"This book actually did more than just interpret passages for me. I actually learned how to look at Scripture properly. I also learned a lot about Jesus, even though I thought I knew a lot about Him already, and the Kingdom. Most commentaries do not cause you to think and chew on passages, but this one did. These commentaries are so far above most of the others in insight and exegesis. Great insight into why Jesus cursed the fig tree. Well done."
2,"Decent book, but not really about the album","Meloy's book is a decent autobiographical look at his experiences discovering music as a child, but it really tells you nothing about the making of (or meaning of) the Replacements' most famous album.After reading the incredible 33 1/3 book on Paul's Boutique, I was expecting to actually learn about the Replacements, or about the creation of Let It Be. Instead, I learned about Meloy's childhood buddy and hiship uncle who introduced him to music. The book was indeed well-written, but not at all what I was expecting.If you want to learn about the making of Let it be, STAY AWAY!"
1,"I'd prefer a book about the Replacements, thank you","How annoying is this? I wanted a book about Let It Be, but instead got a coming-of-age-in-Montana story that only vaguely featured the Replacements. I like the Decemberists a lot, but I'm not *that* interested in Colin Meloy and his camping trips in the woods."
2,Jigga?,"The most self-indulgent words from one of the most boring songwriters in indie rock (though the Decemberists are no longer indie and never came close to rocking) -- this book has nothing to do with the 'Mats. I'm not objecting to the author's use of memoir as commentary about the album, I'm objecting to the unapplicablity of the album to the narrative. Also, I think Colin Meloy should refund the $12 I spent to see his band live. The Replacements would never have put me to sleep."
4,Orion is put back into the thick of world history,"Orion and the Conqueror puts our hero Orion back into the thick of world history as a royal guard to Philip of Macendonia, the father of Alexander the Great. As Philip struggles to conquer/unite Greece, Alexander's mother, who is one of the Creators, struggles to ensure the ascension of Alexander to the throne. This is Orion at his best, fighting with swords and knives as he struggles with his personal loyalties versus the desires of the Creators. As Orion's powers develop, he continues to try to find the mystery behind the intentions of The Golden One. A quick fun read, Orion and the Conquerer is definitely worthwhile despite the one shortcoming of Orion's constant whining about finding Anya, the Creator he loves."
4,Cute book,"Children like holiday books, and this one is a cute one. While not award winning, young children will certainly enjoy this one."
2,"Apparently, a classic text.....","But I thought it was boring & not all that informative. I struggled through it because I was taking a class on CIS. Surely, there's something better out there."
2,Freshpak Rooibos taste change,"I love this tea and drink several cups daily. I just bought 4 packages of Freshpak rooibos tea with an expiration date of Dec 18, 2009. These are packaged differently and do not reference South Africa on the top. The taste is very different however! The tea is much milder and actually a bit sweet. I am very disappointed that the formulation seems to have been changed."
3,A incredible documentary for Champlin fans!,"Ok, this movie is not a real movie but a promotional advertisement for the Club Med. Bad script, bad acting, bad everything EXCEPT if you're like me a big fan of BILL CHAMPLIN, songwriter, musician and singer member of the Band Chicago. In this movie you will enjoy to see him performing 2 entire songs from his album ""Runaway"" (""Sara"" & ""Take it uptown"") on stage. The movie also features Rita Coolidge performing the Boz Scaggs song ""we're not alone""."
2,The worst female vocal ever,"I bought this CD a month ago because I am a huge fan of power & progressive melodic metal. But nobody warned me that the lead vocalist Federica 'Sister' is awfull singer. I don't mind her voice cause it's OK. I hate the style of singing, like she has closed jaws all the time. And the very low point was the start of the album when I heard the singer of Grave Digger.... I don't like his singing too. Overally, the album has some good tunes but again Federica's singing ruins it all."
5,I still listen to this album...,"I got this CD when it first came out, and it has yet to become tired for one reason. Ghost's rhymes are so deeply encoded, I am still just figuring them out now. Lines like ""Rhymes are made of Garlic..."" sound trivial at a first listen, but once more deeply examined reveal hidden meanings (think about it...) On top of this, the album is constructed with some of the hottest beats (see: Mighty Healthy) that fit together to form a cohesive package that is listenable from begining to end. Lastly, the skits are hillarious (see: Woodrow the Basehead) and are still entertaining after hearing them numerous times. Plus this album has one of my personal favorite club songs, Cher Chez La Ghost which rounds the album out along with great collaborations which never seem forced (see: Buck 50). If you are a fan of hip-hop you owe it to yourself to own this album."
4,IRONMAN STRIKES AGAIN ! ! !,"Yeah lately there's been some mediocre Wu solo joints. But never call SUPREME CLIENTELE mediocre. Ghost is back and without Raekwon all over it. Which is a little better because now we have a chance to hear what Ghost is all about. Sure his last album fell off at the end but SUPREME CLIENTELE has hot tracks all over it. Like ""One"", ""Buck 50"", ""Apollo Kids"", ""Ghost Deini"", and one of my favorites ""Wu Banga 101"". Plus his lyrics are more tight on this one. A MUST HAVE FOR ALL WU FANS."
5,Thank You for this book,"It has been nearly nine months since I read this book and I think about it, and Brett, often. I cannot help but be changed by what I have read; Mr. Hobbie, thank you for sharing your daughter with those of us who did not have a chance to know her. I feel as if we could have been good friends, and I do feel close to her, and to your family, in spirit. Thank you again for your immense generousity."
5,Alton is awsome,He teaches you about food and cooking. My teenage boys even like watchingAlton. I have 4 sets of his DVD's and they are all great. They make greatwedding gifts for people that you do not know very well.
2,Look Elsewhere,"This device was purchased for a small office with around 10 employees. It was an upgrade from a much older and less expensive Linksys G router.This device however is riddled with problems. It routinley drops CPU's from the network, hardly works with any print servers, does not retiain settings, etc...I'm not saying that it doesn't work at all...but you can expect to be resetting connections on a regular basis."
1,"Bad product, worse support...","Cisco Linksys WRVS4400N 4-Port Wireless-N Gigabit Security Router with VPNAs the owner of an IT services company we frequently download large files. The version 1.1 of this router that we purchased would download a partial file and then stop due to bad code controlling the MTU. After calling Cisco support, who admitted being able to recreate the issue, they had no fix and basicly ceased to respond to any further request for support. Beyond that the router would disconnect from the internet frequently which required power cycling to get the router working again. One tech finally took ownership and allowed an RMA to be generated. The product was replaced with an older version 1.0 refurbished product which was poorly packed and was received damaged. I have now ordered a new NetGear to replace this junk. I wouldn't recommend Linksys or Cisco small business products for anyone needing quality equipment."
2,Expected more from Cisco,"The router is stable, and it does what says, but any access control is cumbersome. The documentation if fairly limited, and the help explanations are ambiguous. The menus are not straight forward. It was difficult to configure some fairly simple access control. The controls were limited, and it took Cisco support days to answer questions. They eventually had to resort to reading the source code to figure out the answer to my questions. When limitations on the manufacturer claims were discovered, the answer was, ""Well this is an entry level router"" despite feature claims. VPN is 3DES only. The first router also suffered from sudden death while configuring access controls and came up in a partially configured state that would not allow further configuration. Had to RMA the product back to Cisco.All-in-all I am very disappointed in this router, and 2 stars is generous. I gave it 2 stars only because it does seem to run for long periods of time uninterrupted (as expected). PK"
4,Not as bad as others proclaim,"We've been on the WRVS4400N for over two years. In the beginning the box was a bit flaky. It did sieze once but certainly not a lot. We figured it was firware on the modem so had the cable company update the modem firware (rebooting does it too) and after about 3 reboots of the firmware on the modem, the router has been stable, mostly.Over the years it has degraded WAN performance once. After suffering for a while with reboots, blogs, and helpdesks, the answer was a firware update. Wireless is not an issue. It is configured for local WPA2/PSK and also has a secondary WAP also configed but on a different SSID with WPA/PSK.As for SPI, our network of 1 PC, 2 SANs, 4 laptops, 4 wireless phones, 2 wireless tables, and a video server remain clean. Is it perfect, no but it is better than others we've worked with.Cisco is NOT heading in the right direction regarding stable releases but this device has been a good investment.-RJ"
4,As described,"I bought this router to connect VPN tunnel to a Cisco RV220W. Setup is detailed as required for secure connection. The Cisco VPN setup wizard did not succeed. What I learned is that VPN throughput is limited by the upload speed of ISP, which is generally sacrificed for fast download. In other words, VPN transfer is still slow on our system"
3,complicated,"I purchased this item based on my experience with previous products i have used and made by linksys/sisco now, and its very reliable without a doubt. I specifically wanted a VPN service to use it when I'm abroad and in countries where they have blockage on certain sites. The router is ready to be used with sisco server, but i tried so hard to get the service with them and faced with lack of attention, as they only care about companies and numbers, not to forget the charges are outrageous. The device has so many features that i don't use or need, its like buying a 7 seats mini van for a family of 2."
1,Dated and Biased,"There's some good points in the book, but most of it is left-biased. One of the authors was a speech writer (foreign policy) under Clinton. The book is also outdated (2005) and discuss insurgents who have been killed.There are better books out there on this subject."
3,Disappointing,"This book did not come close to the Griffin and Sabine series despite its recommendation for people who like Bantok's work. While parts are funny, other parts are too hard to follow or just too outrageous to get what the author is trying to convey."
4,Fun Look at the Toys We Used to Play With,"This video provides an enjoyable look back to the toys loved by baby boomers. The toy makers sure did something right, because to the best of my knowledge they are all still in production.This 52 minute tape examines eight toys -- Barbie Dolls, G.I. Joe, Slinky, Matchbox Cars, Etch-A-Sketch, Twister, Ant Farms, and Radio Flyer wagons. Much of the video has footage of the toys in use and their commercials.In addition, behind the scenes footage shows the toys' developers and some of the factories busy manufacturing them.Having never broken an Etch-A-Sketch, I was glad to see inside one and now fully appreciate how it works! Also noteworthy were the lengths Matchbox engineers would go to make sure their toy cars were accurate."
3,"Better title would be: ""Handbook of Handgunnery""","First of all, the title was misleading, second, the author threw in a few chapters of instructions on making guns trace-proof, how to make zip guns, and other extreamist rightwing jargon. On the other hand, the rest of the book is informative, and provides a nice overview of handguns in general. So, its a good book to have if you are thinking about aquiring a pistol, but not for details about specific guns."
1,Do not buy it!!!,"This machine is WORTHLESS. But I did get it at a fairly cheap price it was not the cheapest. The machine has classic ""nesting"" near the bobbin. Also there is something horribly horribly wrong with the tension. I have knotting on both sides, it's ridiculous. The machine can not sew a straight line, it takes hours to do a simple project, do not buy it."
5,Great Little Machine,"I recently purchased this wonderful machine after having my old one for the past 20 years. My old one was a Singer and had cost more when new than this one. The new one has twice as many features and is just so easy to work with. I am a novice when it comes to sewing, using the machine for minor repairs and alterations.I will certainly be using this one more frequently! This price was the cheapest on the net and in retail.Thanks,Abbey McLeod"
4,Nice Sewing Machine for light work,"This is a nice sewing machine for day to day simple work. Hard to use on think cloth and beware, trying to use it on Jeans may break it or at least Jam it. But for light work, it works flawless. Have been using more than a year and still working. Good value for price paid."
4,Blues Done AEROSMITH Style,I have always been a huge fan of Aerosmith which is why I bought this CD. I was going to name my favorite tracks but there are too many to list. I don't want to and wouldn't even try to compare this to original Blues artists. This is Aerosmith! enough said.....
3,good covers disc.,"this is a average cd for this band , it's mainly covers of blues tracks! but they are good covers. However: the band needed to follow this up with new material or release this in the same year as new stuff. Instead they haven't put out a darn thing since and that's a bad idea! you don't do tribute cd's without lots of new stuff around it, that sabatoges one's career even if the covers are good ones.The cd's name though was one of the worst in the history of rock to be sure but that didn't make the cd a bad one. The tour they did was excellent that year with kiss! and the songs they played from this sounded great. But they need to charge back now!"
1,Honkin is what you'll be doing Bobo,"Nothing new original or listenable here. 1 star for effort.Made a great frizbee,dog caught it on first toss."
2,Aerosmith in search for vocalist,"The band play superbly but what marrs this album is Stephen Tylers unstoppable hard man of rock, tuneless and for the most part inappropriate vocals. He sounds like he's sitting on spike all the way through the session. You can count on one hand the number of times that Perry gets to take a solo without Tyler screaming his nuts off over the top of it and reducing it all to a mind numbing cacophony. The overall effect is to over clutter the mix, a blues singer he ain't and the word restraint ain't in his dictionary.Shame really because after about three listens, I can honestly say that there a about three tracks that I can bear to listen to repeatedly, mainly because someone had the sense to glue Tylers immense mouth shut for a while."
1,20 Years to Late,This was a good idea that DOES NOT work out....Timing is everything and Aerosmith has been around and enjoyed success for a long time butthis is a album that should have been thought of in the 1980's before time took its toll on one of the better rock & Roll bands.....To the point......It stinks.
2,Ho hum,"I'm not really an Aerosmith fan, but I've been listening to the blues for about half a century, and play a little Strat myself. Subtract the 19 cent keychain and Aerosmith's previous arena-rock reputation, and what's left is mostly a very, very ordinary CD. Two or three tracks have interesting interpretations, and a comparison of the band's ""Never Loved a Woman"" to The Commitments' cover of ""Never Loved a Man"" is fun, but on the whole, It feels like I got about $3 worth of good rock / blues for my $13.99. That's not what I consider a ""good value"" for my money."
2,disapointing,Im a huge aerosmith fan...I have loved them from day one...but they have let me down with this cd. i have loved every cd but this. What is up with blues? go back to rock...rock rules...blues suck. they should make another cd like nine lives.
2,"The jig is up, boys","The last decent album these cats made was ""Done with Mirrors"" from way back in the '80s. Anything after that particular record has been complete garbage, sorry to say, and this blues wannabe CD is no exception.Tyler and co. should hang it up, but you know they won't anytime soon, since they love their inexplicable fame way too much.For music with a true message, check out Jackal 'n' Slade, not to mention Van Halen, who might be reuniting with Roth soon. Let's hope that's the case!!!!!!ENJOY YOUR DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,GREAT ROCK AND ROLL ALBUM !!!!,"Sincerely, this is and will be one of best rock and roll album of 2004. Congratulations, Mrs. Tyler, Perry, Kramer,Whitford and Hamilton."
4,Not What I'd Call A Good Title,"What kind of silly title is Honkin' On Bobo? Somebody please reply what bobo means! The music is great, the best they have done in years, but I give this album 1 less star due to the ridiculous title."
1,GLORY DAYS ARE NOT BACK!!,I don't know what the hub-bub is all about...this latest effort is sadly disappointing (yet again). As an early fan of great heavy and funky blues discs (first album up to Draw The Line....all throw-a-ways after that). I should've known better than to become prematurely excited about this waste of money. Oh well!!
1,Don't call it blues....,"You would have to be a die hard fan to appreciate the monotone screaming on this album. Billed as a blues album, it sounds more like Yoko Ono on helium. One star is 3/4 too many."
3,"Not Bad, but Not Great","Aerosmith is and will always be a Stones ripoff. And this CD tries to portray Aerosmith as a great blues band like the Stones is. Nice try, it's pretty good, but if you want real blues by a rock and roll band, try the old Stones CDs."
2,"Slow, without much to hold the reader's interest.",As exciting as you'd expect a book about a butler driving around England thinking about being a butler would be. It would be better if at the end he turned into a cannibalistic serial killer and Superman had to stop him.
2,I'll take Mr. Hudson,"I remain baffled by the acclaim heaped on this book. I was never convinced by Stevens, who feels like a literary construct, a cliche ""perfect servant"". He's so self-effacing that he barely exists as a man. I kept thinking of Mr. Hudson on ""Upstairs, Downstairs."" Now there is a butler who is also a real human being with his own opinions and feelings. I'm sad to learn that high school kids are being assigned to read this pretentious bore."
3,A compelling story of a private life,"A story about an English butler of post-war England that is well worth your time to read. It is a short 250 page book that is great for weekend reading in the cold of winter. I could not put it down and having read the book it added greatly to my enjoyment of the movie by the same name in which Anthony Hopkins played a ""perfect"" Mr. Stevens."
3,"INTERESTING, GOOD TO LEARN ENGLISH","I am not English, and I enjoyed this novel to learn such polite English. Rather entertainig.By the way, great delivery service by Amazon. Very fast."
5,Best people-oriented book for Six Sigma practitioners,"Mr. Eckes has done us all a great service by applying his background as a psychologist to Six Sigma implementation, both from a tactical and strategic perspective. It's easy to get caught in the technical trap of Six Sigma and overlook the people impact. In this book, George bypasses the technical side, assuming we are familiar with it, and gets into the people issues from every perspective I can think of. There isn't another book out there that deals with this issue as clearly and in as much depth as MAKING SIX SIGMA LAST. Great Book!!! Five Stars. Thanks, George!"
1,"donny osmond millennium collection, both cd's",both cd's skipped nearly every song. i am very disappointed as this was a Xmas present for my wife. have not yet rec'd my refund for the cd or for shipping both cd's back to AMAZON. I will not ORDER from AMAZON untill i get my refund back. I will also tell all my buddies about this. They will back me up on this as they all laughed at my wife's disapointment
5,The best,I frame custom homes for a living and use this hammer everyday. It is hands down the best hammer ever made. I have carried almost every type of hammer out there and there is no match for it.
5,One of my favorite Hillsong albums!,I have every Hillsong Album and this is may favorite.The first 9 songs I just listen to straight through every time I flip it on. Amazing pentecostal worship that exemplifies the power of God!
2,fit ok but not good,they fit ok but you could hit with your feet when you get in the car also very expensive product will not buy again
3,Go to the source,"Okay, I haven't read this book, so can say nothing about it (hence the neutral 3 stars). But I certainly hope Ardagh doesn't take personal credit for the term ""translucence"" to describe the next phase of human evolution. That term was introduced by Jean Gebser in ""The Ever-Present Origin,"" a genuinely original, ground-breaking work of genius written decades ago, long before there was a New Age Movement. Many ideas that people are tossing around have their roots in that book, without crediting the source. (He first introduced the idea of human evolution as a successive layering of magical, mythic, rational, and translucent consciousness.) Be warned, Gebser's book is not an easy read. It's not written for general audiences, so maybe Ardagh is serving a useful purpose in writing something that apparently is. Just give credit where it's due -- translucence was Gebser's idea."
3,Translucent Revolution - Arjuna Ardagh,"I have gained some insight to myself by reading this book, it can be a little heavy going so recommend to not rush it. My transaction with Amazon.com was seamless - what a great service.Beth MackenzieAnnandale, NSW Australia"
1,Not up to par with their claims,"Emile Henry claims that these are dishwasher safe, but mine developed a crack from rim to base within a couple of years. It was only used as a cereal bowl. Unfortunately, this is a common problem with this bowl. Not recommended."
4,Ho hum really,"These bowls are lovely quality I""m sure but they actually look more vibrant in the picture than they do in reality. They are a perfect size but they really don't look like the good quality item that I expected.....they are pretty boring really."
1,"Boring and not really a ""Faith Fairchild"" mystery","I had a REALLY hard time getting into this one; it really isn't a ""Faith Fairchild"" mystery considering the story is all about Faith's friend Pix and her daughter. I also didn't like the resolution with Duncan. A rather long and tedious read.Note: I've read this entire series up toThe Body in the Attic: A Faith Fairchild Mystery (Faith Fairchild Mysteries), and the best rating I've given any of them is 2 stars, which is sad and says a lot about the series. I kept reading because it really has potential but it never lives up to it, so save yourself the trouble and agony and try a a different series, such as Carolyn Hart'sDeath on Demand (Death on Demand Mysteries, No. 1)series, most of which are fun and enjoyable, or stop afterThe Body in the Cast: A Faith Fairchild Mystery, which was probably the best of the series. That's my recommendation, anyway."
4,too big,"i contacted the company directly to inquire about the sizing. they said that the toddle small was approximately for children in 2T clothing. I figured great, my son is in 18-24 month clothing so this shouldn't be too big, wrong! they are huge. with that being said im going to hold on to them until next winter instead of returning them b/c i really like the design of them."
3,Blink???,"I was seriously considering this band out until I heard the 9 million ""they are like BLINK"" reviews. Wow... what a turn off."
1,The Backstreet Boys of the pop-punk circuit.,"I was BEYOND dissatisfied with this album. It was overproduced to the point of killing whatever trace of musical talent these boys had in them. Due to certain 'connections' I have in Southern California, I heard a copy of this CD pre-production. Oh My God, it was dying, and going to pop-punk heaven. I immediately named them my new favorite band. I counted the days until the CD was released. I rushed to Sam Goody that very day and bought it. Listening to it on the way home, I couldn't believe that I had wasted money on this piece of .... They should have kept it more raw, more pre-production. Sure, they wouldn't have you kids who are now in love with New Found Glory's recent sound (you should have heard them while they were still on Fiddler...it makes your ears cry) drooling over it, but they would still have some musical integrity. Don't waste your money."
2,Don't do it.,"This book initially held a lot of appeal for me because of its part-of-speech format. And in fact, I found it to be a very helpful way to structure the lessons. The unfortunate reality is that the book is riddled with errors. It's hard to believe that it's even for sale. Some of the errors are small type setting problems, like constantly using the letter à for a in both French and English, but then there are also some very confusing mistakes, where the book breaks the very rule it just presented. I invariably had these errors confirmed by a friend who is a native French speaker. Don't waste your time or money on this book."
5,best hammer I've ever owned,Your arm will thank you. I broke the claw off it bending metal tiebacks/abusing the hammer. Figured what the heck worst they can do is say no. Sent it back they replaced no questions asked. I was so impressed with the warranty service I bought an extra one. All the guys you work with will have hammer envy.GREAT PRODUCE EVEN BETTER SERVICE IF YOUR BUYING TITANIUM BUY STILETTO.
1,Weightless,"Found the hammer head to be way too light, causing discomfortthroughout my arm from any extended nail driving. Purchased a 21OZmilled faced framing hammer at same time and found it to be completely satisfactory."
5,Worth Reading Twice,"It's simply astounding how good this book is. It's content-rich, intellectually satisfying, spiritually convicting, and culturally and politically relevant. It's the last book I asked my daughter to read before she left for college. It's all organized brilliantly and presented with intellectual dignity. Colson and Pearcy don't hold any punches spiritually, arguing that Christianity offers the best answers to all philosophical, scientific and ideological challenges -- we must simply resolve to articulate them to a lost society. In sum, a very engaging and profound work. I'll be going through it again with each of my other three children."
4,Great product,"My husband and I have tried different types of pedometers and found that we are very happy with this one. Others that we have tried have had problems with the clips breaking, really inaccurate counts and trouble staying on. I have hips and a 38 inch waist so I had a hard time finding one that stays on. This one does not have any of the above problems and it gives you the option to adjust the sensitivity for a more accurate count for each individual. I usually use the time, distance and steps features."
1,Now I understand what the other reviewers were saying...,"The Claber 8583 Koala Indoor Faucet to Garden Hose Connector looks like a decent made item but other than that, it was not what I had hoped for and is useless to me (not worth shipping back). I now understand what the other reviewers were saying about this item. If your faucet has any curves to the top - this will not work for you (I have the Kohler Fairfax). If your faucet is stick straight or from the ""1950s thereabout"" this may work for you (?)."
2,"Great Concept, But Won't work with any faucet in my house.","Briefly, like many have stated, it won't fit on any faucet found in my house. I actually see exactly how it could work, but you will need to have a faucet that is flat on top and with very little room between the faucet opening and top of the metal frame of it."
1,"Tried it on 7 faucets, didn't work on any","Purchased it to fit on utility sink so we could pump warm water into the backyard toddler pool (it doesn't get too warm in this part of the country) and it didn't fit. In fact, it did not fit on any faucets in our house, nor any at my neighbor's house. I took it to Home Depot to see if a cheap faucet was available that would fit it... none at a decent price. We rigged a couple plumbing fittings and faucet supply lines together create a solution for less than the price of this product."
2,doesn't work on all faucets.,You have to be careful because it doesn't fit all faucets they have to be thin or it won't fit. Then you're stuck with it because to return it wasn't worth the money.
4,More Of The Same ..But,"Also nice to "" See He Ain't Heavy He's My Brother "" gracing this CD!! Digital remastering is also encouraging. But...how many prominent 70's groups have sold millions of albums during a 40 plus year career and have one original LP out on CD to their credit? Can only think of a few and sadly the Osmonds are one of them. The true die hard fan deserves better. I would suggest to Curb/Universal to put a halt to any further Greatest Hits packages and try releasing their entire 70's catalogue of LP's to CD. This includes Osmonds , Donny Osmond , D & M , & Jimmy. And why stop there !! Their 60's catalogue needs dusting off as well. Generations of fans are missing out on all this great music !!"
1,poor quality!!,"I was so looking forward to this CD, but much to my dismay..it sucks!!Very poor sound quality, only will play on my laptop..not even on my cd player that will play burned cds...buy at your own risk!!"
1,Absolutely terrible remastering,"Like the Donny & Marie and Donny companion compilations, this cd sounds just dreadful. Like so many other recent reissues, the person doing the remastering tried to make these recordings sound as ""modern"" as possible, meaning that they have eliminated what little dynamic range was present to begin with on these recordings and also set the EQ so that the tonal balance is on the extremely bright side. Donny's voice, for example, is thin and harsh sounding. This is the worst sounding Osmonds collection I've heard, and I have everything Curb has issued on cd. Avoid this one at all costs."
5,The BEST book ever written!,This book is fabulous! I have met the author and he is the smartest man that ever lived. This book changed my life. BUY THIS BOOK!!! It will get you hooked! I love this book. There cannot be a better book ever written. I could not put it down. You will not be disappointed. Dr. Botzman is a genius!
3,Caution-Does not fit Hitachi M12V2,"The Router Lift appears to be a great device, but the design is so old that it does not have a hole pattern in the ""master ring"" that fits the newer (2006) Hitachi M12V2 router that replaced the M12. Make sure you can use this Router lift on your Router while the lift is still within the return perod to your supplier."
4,4 1/2 stars,"See storyline above.Carsten Stroud, one of my favorite spy thriller writers, delivers yet another exciting adventure involving both politics and terrorism. This novel will keep you on the edge. The story and writing style, both solid, will keep thriller fans happy. The only bad thing I noticed was the editing. If there are three or four mistakes I usually won't mention it, but there are at least twice this many.Highly recommended."
1,Disappointing,"This book is short (72 pages), inaccurate (all transsexuals must go to Mexico of breast augmentation), and pure vanity press. A certain charm in only that it gives a very brief view from a unique persepctive. For the price, not a recommneded buy...Of all the TS bios currently out in POD, this is the worst, and least informative.Willow"
4,Witches and Vampires and Zombies Oh my!,"I have to admit I bought this dvd for the sheer sake of the cover (at first) then after watching it and me being a huge total Horror head that I am, found it more and more interesting as I watched it, not as entertaining as the first time I had seen CREEPSHOW but still interesting. One reason in particular was it is hosted by John Russo ""and if you don't know who he is then may a zombie come into your bedroom tonight and eat you!"" no seriously he is the writer of Night Of The Living Dead and Return Of The Living Dead movies is that kool or what! There's several clips and scenes from feature films and even a short film you probably haven't seen yet? So to get to the Brains of the gray matter, *joke* I thought it was worth the money if you are a Horror enthusiast like me you will too. Now where is that remote, dim the lights, get the popcorn, sit down and relax and enjoy the show... Oh and don't forget to look behind you once in a while...he, he, he, he"
2,No Finland.,"I bought this product for the Finland episode and it's not on the DVDs, even though it says ""FROM FINLAND TO TOKYO"" on the cover.I wish I would have known that before I wasted my money on this product."
5,"Finally, a professor who tells it like it is!",What a great book that truly respects the importance of great literature. Such a rarity in today's superficial academic environment. I wish I could have dinner with the Prof and enjoy some great conversation!!sps
3,great footage less than great story line,dissproportionate allowance for american participation in the war Mostly for american -british audience rest of the war treated marginally. Great footage ok narrator
3,it was alright,I read this book when it was given to me as a present and i thought it was pretty good except for the feeling of the time it was set in the things these girls get up to would've ruined their reputation forever not mention preventing them making a conquest at all all in all it was a good story
1,Lyrically challenged,"To me, This is one sorry album. The lyrics are pathetic on 2 songs. Hookers taking her man? Hookers having babies. Give me a break. Keep your nightmares to your self. This one is for the trash bin. Aw, but you can dance to it. Glad I only paid $ for it. I'll never trust the magazine that recommended it. Another pretty face that someone decided to bank roll.Jim Tavegia"
1,Boring and Bland,"This was a book club selection. I am a librarian and was able to get the book from work and I am so glad that I did. If I had spent my hard-earned money on this book, I would have been very upset! The story had great potential but I found the ""tough love"" story line a little hard to believe and swallow. The story skipped large chunks of time and I found myself going ""huh""? I could not make myself have any type of emotional attachment to these characters. This book just didn't do it for me at all."
1,Do not buy this if you work in the construction field,Go with calculated industries if you need a calculator for work in the construction field. I bought 5 of these for my crew and they all broke within 3 months. The construction master series by calculated industries will last years under the same conditions. These are only good if you just need it for desk work.
5,"when it works, it works",I only used the sonin 2000 for stairs and rafters and to be perfectly honest it worked every time the given numbers worked like a charm and it was fast and easy.If I had anything bad to say about the inchmate it would be that it broke the very first time I dropped it from a 6' ladder.Another major issue is that I only paid 19.95 for it at a Menards home improvement center now it's online for 39.00 somethings wrong. At that price the construction master is a much better buy.
5,seems sturdy,I am using this for storing some craft / jewelry making supplies (mainly beads) It works great for utilizing unused space. I would recommend this item. So far I have had no problems with it.
4,very good,"i don't have any complaint about this product. you can see other products more expensive and similar, this one do the same job."
5,"Simple, cheap, perfect","We purchased the over the door shoe rack for our cruise that we were taking, being there is not a lot of space in a cabin. It worked perfectly. The metal hooks fit standard size doors and the top of the shoe rack has reinforced metal rings so that it won't tear. It folds up flat, so it is easy to pack and un-pack. We used most of the shoe rack for storing things other than shoes, and found that pockets were durable to hold all sorts of items. We liked it so much, it is now being used on the back side of our closet door. And for the price - you just can't beat it!"
5,Great for my daughters stuff,"We don't use ours for shoes.We use it for camera, ipod, nintendo ds, ect."
1,Won't play on a normal DVD player,"Sad day! My kid is obsessed with Fresh Beat Band, but the format to these DVDs is funky. It will play on my computer and portable DVD player, but NOT my normal DVD player, the primary reason I bought them in the first place. Bummer!"
5,Perfect Birthday Gift,"I ordered both videos for my granddaughter's 2nd birthday. I was kind of skeptical about ordering after reading some of the reviews about how the videos did not play in certain machines. Well I am happy to say that she has been able to watch the videos on her portable dvd player,laptop and regular dvd player. She absolutely loves the videos. This is her favorite show. She watches them everyday for hours. They have truly been a blessing."
1,Don't bother,"This is a piece of garbage unless you want to read about a ego driven nobody named Plym. This book is more about Plym than Tiny Tim. Plym embodies all that is bad [vulgar, self centered and sleazy] in an show business personal manager. Just one look at his photo [of which he has included many in the book] will tell you more than you want to know.It's is a testament to a loser ... Plym, not Tiny Tim, who deserves more than this book gave him. The 1976 book by Harry Stein is much better and worth reading. Buy that one. Don't waste your money on this. This one belongs on the bottom of the garbage heap."
4,for big beat fans only,If your into fatboy slim and the chemical brothers then this will be for you. nothing new just more of the same.
4,for hubby,Great book full of a lot of practical ideas on health and has helped my husband a great deal with his various old age aches and pains..............
5,Great book,Great book. I have taken some of the ideas to the Dr and they have helped. Would highly recommend this book.
1,lame,Got a message a week later after purchase confirmation that item was no longer available. Very disappointing. Should have better tracking system
5,Famous Men famously presented,This is an excellent survey of the men who shaped history in the middle ages. It brings history to life by allowing the reader to get to know the personalities of the men presented.
2,Poor design makes this a shoddy book,"If you're looking to buy a copy of Famous Men of the Middle Ages by John H. Haaren, don't buy this version!Although Rob Shearer is listed as one of the authors, his introduction is not in this book. The back cover copy is for a different book. The text was not formatted for pages of this size (if it was formatted at all), so captions for the pictures sometimes occur on the next page. The art appears plopped into the flow of the text almost randomly, and the copy quality of the art is poor: grainy and difficult to decipher the subject(s), even in the larger pictures. Altogether, a slipshod job.I was attempting to save a few dollars by buying this version, but in the end it's going to cost me more as I'm going to have to buy a different version, one with higher quality pictures and a more pleasing layout."
1,Marketing Phrase Book (Professional Edition),"On receipt of this book I was reminded of the Spanish proverb ""cheat me on price...never on product""The content of this publication provides a useful shortcut to the dictionary. However, having paid ... for this product, I must stress my disappointment with the physical quality. It is poorly reproduced. Unless you can live with the imperfection of the reproduction, consider buying the non-professional addition of this book and save yourself a lot of dollars in the process."
5,Cutting Edge,"I was hesitate to order a cheese knife online but when I couldn't locate one like mine in the store, I decided to order this one. It turns out, it is nicer than my other one! Nicely constructed and should last for years to come. I was pleased to give it as a gift and if mine ever dies, I'll order this one again."
2,Flawed design for cheese,"This knife has a serrated edge with an asymmetrical bevel. The bevel causes the blade to tend to deviate from vertical, making it somewhat difficult to cut straight down. I am learning to apply opposite torque with my wrist, but I would prefer a blade with a symmetrical bevel. I would not buy it again."
4,If you only read one book about literary theory...,"...who would blame you? Still, the educated layperson who wants to bump their understanding of contemporary literary criticism up to a respectable cocktail party level probably can't do much better than Eagleton's slim, thoroughly accessible introduction to the subject. ""Literary Theory"" traces the history of literature as a subject of academic study from English Romanticism, through Saussure and semiotics, all the way to the fashionable heavy-hitters of postmodernism. Neither an acolyte nor a debunker, Eagleton gives each theory a clear explanation and a fair shake in crisp, jargon-free prose. He is up front about his own ideological slants (feminist, Marxist), and although the last of these can at times make him sound quaintly Cold War, at no point does he drop into didacticism. This is a book that truly lives up to its subtitle."
2,Only experts need apply. . .,"""Literary Theory"" was one of the least useful books I've read in my career as a literature student. What poses as a general reader on theory studies instead gives Eagleton a forum for glorifying an academic elite. His eagalitarian stance aims to keep the ""common folk"" out of the white tower of academia. He is condescending and unwelcoming from the first chapter on, destroying any chance of engaging his LITERARY ideas. A sad waste of a potentially hepful book."
5,best choice of compact Hebrew dictionaries,"Comprehensive and easy to use. Good for the beginner in Hebrew language study. But it is just a dictionary, does not have grammar or pronunciation guides for Hebrew. It may be more intended for Hebrew speakers learning English, but if what you want is a reasonably compact dictionary that works both ways (Hebrew-English and English-Hebrew) this one is the best I've seen."
5,the zilberman hebrew dictionary,"for the price, this is one of the best hebrew-english dictionaries on the market. it is easy to use and has a large amount of information. this inables the user to have a quality dictionary without wasting time with usless information."
2,You only need the first video,I bought both and really only needed the first one. I agree with other reviews: the camera shots are annoying. I liked the instructor but it really was just a review of the first video.I did like Coralissa's dance. She was inspiring.
5,character driven- how smallness in life can really be big,"The wonderful character voices created by McGhee show, simply, how small things in life can be big and how we all deal with the SAME things in different ways. Examples of true human nature abound, while exploring grief and what it takes for some of us to move on. This novel is wonderfully written, really great character composition, which I find is lacking in too many books. Malle, especially, is someone who will stay with me a long time. Will definitely read McGhee's next work."
1,tri prep,"I bought this journal hoping to have a great place to record my workouts. That is not what I got. The space is limited, and I feel like I need to take a class in journaling the Joe Friel way. I only bought this journal, because I had read one of books and loved it. I quit trying to use this journal and went back to my old fashion way of using a regular journal."
4,Informative yet Expensive,"This book was filled with lots of information about networks, tcpip and other protocols. It does touch on some topics pretty heavily and can get confusing for newbees but overall it is a good book. I used it for a college course but may also be a good reference book. THE PRICE IS STEEP SO NO 5 STARS FROM ME!"
4,Revealing and Thought Provoking,"Read this book for a tutorial class called ""Construction and Maintenance of the Self"". Baumeister conveys his theoritical perspective on the meaning of the self (and its implications on the meanings of life)in a highly accessible and convincing manner. He argues from the perspective that the self is a social construct and that in the West, the meanings that have been put into the construction and maintenance of this self have created a burden on the individual. The stress associated with maintaining this concept of self can be used to explain why people engage in behaviors such as alcholism and sado-masochism. I highly recommend this book, especially if you are interested in concepts of the self and its relation to (what Baumeister would not consider) self-disruptive behaviors."
4,victor,"Please bere with me as I can not give a review for this album simplebecause I have no listing to give a review,however Victor Silvesterhas and always will be one of the great dance band leaders, so couldsomeone let me know what is on this album.thanking youMorris Part."
4,If only I had opened this book before the exam.,"A wonderful reference tool for the professional conservitor, or even the ""Matha Stewart"" home fixer-uper."
1,Disappointed,"I have purchased Deep Red many times on Amazon and it has always been fine. However, this time the bottle that was sent to me which I purchased for my wifes Mother's Day present was much different. Whatever was in this bottle was not Deep Red. My guess is that this particular seller is not shipping the genuine Hugo Boss Deep Red. There seems to be no return on this item. Very disappointed!"
1,Does not smell like the original,"This was a gif t for my Fiance for Christmas. Being her favorite perfume, she knows what it should smell like and this was not even close. She even had a bottle with a quarter left to compare the scents. A fake or old and gone bad, either way, it's garbage as it has that 'old lady perfume' smell."
5,SSSOOOO HAPPY!!!,"LOVE THIS PARFUM AND GLAD I FOUND IT ON AMAZON BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER BEING SOLD IN STORES.I AM SO HAPPY,BECAUSE ITS A FAVORITE OF MINE AND WHEN I WAS TOLD BY THE SALES LADY AT MACY'S THAT IT HAD BEEN DISCONTINUED I WAS UPSET. THEN I DECIDED TO CHECK ONLINE AND SINCE I MAKE A LOT OF PURCHASES WITH AMAZON I DID NOT HESITATE TO BUY IT FROM THEM AT A GREAT PRICE TOO...I AM VERY HAPPY!!!!!"
1,Product does not fit the shape of your foot.,I had bought this product to help with some of my overlapping toes. I feel I wasted my money. The product does not fit my foot at all. While wearing it the pad part sticks out an inch past my foot making it very inconvenient. I was hoping to find something I could wear with my shoes. This did not work for me.
4,childhood favorite,I remember this book from when I was a little girl. It was an all time favorite for me and brings back many great childhood memories. I had a hard time finding it so was thrilled to be able to buy it. The book was in a little worse condition than I was expecting. But the sentimental value outweighs that. I am quite satisfied with my purchase!
4,Pumping song,"This is a really cool dance song, its got all the bass beats you need. PLUS its got the phone ring that makes everybody reach in the club for their phone what a crack up!. This one really thumps out. Except a couple of the remixes on here are terrible. But still a good record none the less."
2,Sadly disappointing,"As a long time fan of Placebo, I must admit, I was expecting something more. Something different than...well, different than this. I don't know what I waz expecting, but after hearing the double CD Sleeping with Ghosts and the incredibly intricate remixes of the second CD of remixes, MEDS feels like, just the same old thing. Been there, done that. I was hoping for so much more. I can't say this was a horrible album, it wasn't. It just wasn't new enough and exciting enough for me to give a better rating. Very lackluster contribution to an otherwise phenomenal discography of a great band, who wasn't unable to live up to its greatness this time. Hopefully next time. I'm keeping my fingers crossed!"
5,Placebo is still awesome.,"I really enjoy Meds, I've listened to the album atleast once a day for the past 6 months. Although it sounds more ""polished"" than their previous albums it doesn't mean the content and talent isn't still there. If you like Placebo and you aren't afraid of growing give this album a listen. It truly is great."
4,Good but not as good As the others.,"I know that placebo took a few years to make this album. I love the band amazing and always suprising in live shows , Very deicated to fans . But I can only give this album a 4 out of five . It's a wonderfully addictive album with a dark erotic twist of Mellencollie . It's delightful but just not as dark as the earlier albums."
2,not very impressive,"this album really is nothing to be that impressed about. the best songs for sure are post blue and pierrot the clown and are really the only two that sound like ""placebo"" to me. a song to say goodbye and infra-red seem good at first but get old really fast and are pretty mediocre songs. meds and the rest of the songs are pretty boring and sadly predictable. i've got to say that placebo's self-titled has got to be my favorite. it is the most angst-filled and grungy and had nothing to prove. the rest of their albums are all really good though and are all different. i think the most dissappointing thing about meds is that instead of actually playing something original and different, it seems like they're just trying too hard to sound different and just end up sounding somewhat the same, somewhat predictable, and ultimately somewhat not their ""trueselves""."
4,I knew it!,"When I first heard about this, I knew they would turn it into a movie. And why not? This is a near tour de force espionage film, that is a splendid, though scary, watch. I read a review that said that they focused too much on one ""not so important figure."" What? How else were they going to get inside the personal side of him, if it wasn't from the person closest to him? How else could you tell a fully accurate version of this story? Idiots!Yes, I recommend this film for: 1) The intrigue of the story line; 2) The acting.Aside from Ryan Phillipes shody performance in the first half, Chris Cooper makes one of th emost splendid performances I've seen in years.Get it."
3,Perverted Breach,"Well done, but I didn't care for the sexual perversion part. It creeped me out! The movie would have been better, for me, without it."
4,Chris Cooper makes a great creep,"Cooper has played this same creepy guy role a million times, and that's because there's something about his expression that is perfect for these characters. It's a mix of righteousness, disappointment, creepy moralism with just the right amount of mystery mixed in. He is perfect as Robert Hansen, the spy who somehow managed to outwit the entire US security apparatus for 20 years while doing more damage than any spy in history. You wonder just how bad the government spy programs must be for one guy to be able to do this. The movie, though we know the ending, is suspenseful because the suspense revolves around the young agent assigned to help bring Hansen down, not whether or not the spy would be caught. Good script. See this asap."
2,"Excellent actors, boring plot","A kind of movie no one needs.Two and a half [ Phillippe ] good actors without any chance to pusha boring, non suspending plot.Allegedly after a true story, but Chris Cooper as a pious catholic and relentless killer seems absolutely incredible.Wasted time and money."
2,Breach smeach,"I was heavily disappointed after and throughout this movie. While I must say that Chris Cooper did an excellent job, I'm not so sure about his counterpart Ryan Phillippe. At times I couldn't tell if it was poor acting, or if it was done on purpose to exaggerate the fact that he was lying. I'm leaning toward this first. This movie seriously lacked action. Aside from a few somewhat tense moments when you think Cooper might be on to Phillippe, the most action occurred when Cooper fired his gun into the air. Very predictable, they didn't even throw in any twists or anything interesting. I could have written this movie between simulations at work. Not to mention the score sounded like a ripoff of Beethoven's 'Moonlight Sonata'."
4,very Good film,"Robert Hanssen is a Compelling figure and he is the Biggest American Spy in the history. He was a FBI Agent for 25 years and this film breaks down his rise, fall and the aftermath of this very compelling story. Chris Cooper and Ryan Phillippe have strong chemistry. the whole story and the elaborate takedown are classic. the commentary and the overall balance and pacing of the film will keep you drawn in."
5,Excellent product,I encountered terrible dust particles on my sensor that I couldn't remove from using the dust blower. I used the liquid and the wand and removed them easily and quickly. I did not damage my sensor either. This is by far the best cleaning kit I have seen. Every photographer should have this cleaning kit.
4,Nice collection of Early MBM,"This is, in essence, the first MBM album ever realeased. It's pretty good, but it has it's weak points. The quality of the album is pretty sub par. It sounds like it was recorded onto a tape that went through the washing machine. But once we get past that, it's awesome. Songs like ""Kneel and Buzz"", ""Give Your Body It's Freedom"", and ""Kick that Man"" are an audio assault for the ears. Great album, but not recommended for first time listeners."
3,not as good,This shampoo replaced a wonderful Pantene product that helped hold the color red and enhanced it. This one is the one that is available so I am stuck. It cleans my hair beautifully but does not enrich the color as the previous product did so well.
1,OLD,Big mistake didn't no it was made a long time ago. Didn't no it was being shipped from outside the U.S.
5,Sleeper,"Obviously another one of Woody Allen's best. The fake fruits and vegetables in one scene turned me off, but other than that, Woody Allen's acting makes it definitely worth watching."
5,"The ""party scene"" is enough to make this a classic in itself","Retro-cool, low budget, futuristic and ultra-chic, this comedy has it all. Not the typical Woody Allen film, and Allen is not for the typical audience, so the title is fitting. It's a glimpse of what Woody Allen USED to be ie ""Without Feathers"" and Take the Money & Run, but in his one attempt at science fiction. I'm definitely a Woody Allen fan yet there are a few of his films I will not watch. Annie Hall is my number 1, after that Manhattan, Hannah & Her Sisters (I've seen this one 10 times I think), but Sleeper is in a class by itself, so it's usually overlooked by most fans. To enjoy this film: relax, look for cheap yet clever special effects, the coolest sets, wardrobes, and dispositions you can ask for. The gay scene is hilarious. The party Diane Keaton throws could be the prototype of a subculture in itself. How this film has eluded cult status I do not know."
2,Certainly Lives Up To Its Title!,"I found it very difficult to stay awake watching much of this film and it certainly was a ""sleeper"" for me although a few of Allen's one-liners were actually really funny even for today's audiences although the vast majority of the film and consequently the jokes do not age well. To call this Allen's ""tribute"" to Keaton and Marx would actually be insulting to both whose works although a lot older than this are a lot funnier.The picture quality is VHS quality and the sound quality is poor and there are no special features worth speaking about on this dvd version of the film. ""Take the Money and Run"" by the way is a far, far better comedy and film and thankfully Allen as a movie maker vastly improves his output over the years since this film.A real sleeper and certainly not Allen's or anyone else's for that matter better moments makes this not recommended."
2,Boring -,"Woody Allen stars as someone who has been preserved for 200+ years after a botched hospital stay, then revived in a new environment. That new environment is supposed to represent some humorous vision of where we might be headed in the future. Except it's just boring - all the way through. Bottom-Line: I'll NEVER watch a Woody Allen movie again."
4,Classic Comedy,Sleeper has some great one-liners as well as some hilarious scenes. The revival of Mr. Monroe in a post-apocalyptic world is definitely one of Woody Allen's best!
2,Trouble with the spindle for large forstner bits,"I have had this drill press for about a year -- i have been building log furniture and fences and use the drill press primarily for large 2-2 1/2 in boring of posts. The press works pretty well for that application, but recently the spindle has started to strip and the chuck keeps falling off the spindle with some obvious metal scarring on the spindle -- I have yet to call Delta, but I'm guessing this shouln't happen under my use pattern. I'll revise on how getting this fixed goes, but I'm not too happy about it... Other than that I really like it, but that is a big caveat"
2,does what it is supposed to-,"- but it has a funny rumble/ rattle. I expect bearings will wear out one month after it is off warranty.Not near as smooth a machine as I had hoped for, I should have just bought a cheapo.Also hard to change speeds, I end up running at the wrong speed very often. Guess the variable speed would have been a better choice, but isn't that one also made in China?-Dan"
4,Great product - Better support,"2 parts: Customer Service anad the product.1. I purchased this 2 months ago. I came with a broken stop collar. I called Amazon customer support and they informed Delta. I got a part immediately, wrong part. I called back and the correct part was shipped without any questions.2. The drill is extremely easy to assemble and it's extremely accurate. It doesn't have any more noise from the hood than any other drill press I looked at. I like the depth adjustment on this model and that was the main decision point."
3,Ferlin Husky,This is a very old CD. The reason I bought it is because of my favorite song from my childhood - Wings of a Dove. Somebody needs to remake this song.
4,Replacement for old 33rpm,"A great replacement for my record that I could no longer play. It makes good listening as we travel the country,"
5,Excellent wrestling book,"For those who don't know, Greco-Roman wrestling utilizes throws that all occur above the waist. This is a skill that can come into play in folkstyle and freestyle wrestling, as well as judo and NHB matches. For that reason allone, I'd recomend getting this book. The author does an excellent job of showing where control points are for this kind of wrestling, and devides the throws into body, arm, and head-and-arm techniques. He also covers Par Terre, or ground wrestling, from a Greco-Roman point of view. The chapter on basics is fantastic, and there are sections on drilling specific skills, such as the bridge, as well as some basic weight lifting, and even a training program. This very rigorous sport has been given the master treatment by Mr. Martell."
2,Fair,"This is kind of a breathless story about some bright computer engineers in the 1970s trying to do something that had never been done before. Runs long, with what seems like a great deal of redundant information. And there's often melodrama (grinding, at times) when straightforward character portraits should have been employed instead."
2,Maybe only a programmer can enjoy this book.,"I was disappointed in this book because the characters were so sketchy. I could hardly tell one character from another until late in the book. The story seemed like a string of unrelated incidents, each one with little point. Every time Kidder would relate something going on in the computer lab, he would give so few details that it was impossible to get interested in the events. There was no definitive explanation as to why people were acting certain ways. Maybe you have to have ""been there."""
3,not as shiny as it looks,"I was watching an anime called ""Lucky Star"" that made me want to make Creme horns for a really long time. I was waiting for a while to purchase this mold, as i was searching for a great recipe. When i got the order, i was searching for the molds in a box full of books (i gave up once, thinking that they forgot to pack the box in). They were stack together in a very small box that could probably fit in your hand. The molds were not as shiny as the picture, but rather dull exterior. The molds did not have a great finishing as some of the metal were protruding (almost forming a triangle shape, rather than a smooth cone look). Overall, great for people with a little space to share and not wanting to spend a lot, but not for people looking for great quality."
4,Work well for the price,"They were exactly what they sound like. They are thinner than more expensive horn molds, which means they will get hotter faster. So if you are trying to roll hot things out of the oven in order to shape them, it's a little difficult. However, on the plus side, they cool quickly just like they heat up quickly. They are not flat cones so you can stand them up upside-down. For the price, and compared to 4 dollars apiece for other types of molds, these get the job done quite well."
2,Complicated,"This CD recorder has far too complicated a set-up to be user-friendly. The instruction manual is utterly useless, leaving it to the buyer to figure out how the machine works. Once the unit is hooked to the amplifier, transferring records to cd isn't easy and tracks need to be separated manually. Machine can only operate with music cds. Headphones are needed to check the CD sound coming from the recording tray. Digital display is also confusing. Maddening, frustrating, and very expensive. The only plus: recorded sound quality is good."
5,Lisa Angelle,"i absolutly love the CD, i love the voice and the way lisa sings she has a unique sound, I am very pleased with my purchase and I have recommended her CD to all my friends even in the UK."
1,pirated copy.,I bought this copy of XP since I had used it on another computer but did not find out until I got on to the Internet 2 years later that this was a pirated copy. And I called Microsoft and explained my situation and they said they were sorry but it was pirated and there was nothing I could do but buy a good copy.I am writing this just to let everyone know that sometimes what looks good isn't
3,"Works fine but not an ""Apple""","Is fine unless you've been in the ""Mac"" world and it is cumbersome in comparison."
1,rotten,I have not received my software. I have emailed the supplier twice and he has not responded at all. I sent Amazon an email detailing this and have not received a response from them either.
2,They should have let Disney make it.,"I consider myself a fanatic Discworld fan, and was really looking forward to the seeing this (and the Wyrd Sisters animation). Boy, what a disappointment. The animation is way down there with Pokemon. And overly exaggagerated british dialects aren't all that funny either. To bungle this when the books are so good is a [...] crime.Save your money and pray to the gods that: 1) The guys who made this never gets to make another one. 2) When the movie comes, the real movie, it is made a lot better than this."
4,Had a lot of good pictures.,There was any info really. There was a lot but the same stuff you can get on the internet. The whole thing was practically pictures but they had some really good pictures so thats why i gave it a higer rating. If you want info don't get this book but if you just want to look at some sick pictures i would get it for an ozzy memorance thing when he dies.
2,from a teenagers point of view,Recently myself and three other girls in my eighth grade language arts class read this book for a report. The book doesn't start out very well and it was difficult to stay interested. It is a realistic view about anorexia and what happens to people with this disease and the consiquences but it didn't hold my attention. I think if more exciting things happened than it would have been better but it was boring. All that happened is that Leslie suffers from anorexia and goes to the hospital we never know what ever happened to her. There was no resolution. But if you want to know about anorexia and what ahppenes to people with them than read this book but if you don't have a long attention span than don't read this book.
5,Great for Teens,"Very well written book about a girl who struggles with her weight and develops anorexia. The book unfolds insight into the life and a rutine of a anorexic person. It is well written and very interesting.The book deals anorexia and the impact it has on friends, family and everyday life.Great to read to young women out there."
5,"This series is spell binding, very difficult to set it down.","I have read all three vol. of this series. Its not quite as emotional as Vol. 2 was. It covers the war front on both the European and Pacific threater during WWII. I've read this book in a couple of days, and have several other people waiting their turn to read it. I highly recomend this book. I just wish that Vol.4 would come out sooner than a year from now."
3,I have mixed feelings,"I haven't decided if I like this DVD yet. The presentation of this DVD is very catchy, it attracts the attention of my 2 3/4 year-old-triplets but the sound is SO poor and vague. Most of the time, you wouldn't be able to hear the sound of ""s"" being pronounced. I am a native Chinese speaker from Taiwan, the pronunciation of this DVD is heavily accented by someone who is from Beijing. One can argue that mandarin Chinese is rooted in Beijing, but the accent is so heavy that it is a bit ""village-y""."
2,Isabel's novel is not alltogether credible,"Allende's imagination took incredible leaps based on non-historical documents to describe some South American early civilizations as extremely cruel and corrupt (Incas) while others were described as peaceful and loving (Mapuches). Probably untrue en both counts, based of textbooks. The book was wordy and tedious and could not even get to the end, somewhat boring."
3,"NO ""GLASS CEILING"" FOR INES","Based upon the life of a Doa Ines Suarez, a 16th century woman who left her life as a seamstress in Spain to travel to the ""New World"" in an attempt to find her missing husband, Juan. Upon discovering her husband is dead she decides to remain in Peru rather than return to Spain. She aligns herself with Don Pedro de Valdivia, a field marshall in the army of Pizarro. Their life together is initially filled with romance and a common goal to found a country based on Christian and egalitarian values. Their relationship is eventually doomed as Valdivia pursues his personal quest for glory. Through it all, Ines remains true to her ethics and triumphs to become the first female President of Chile."
4,Entertaining,"The novel itself is very entertaining. The narration is good at best, unfortunately the narrator's accent was inconsistent."
5,Amazing,"This is one of those books that you will be sad to finish. I loved it. It is the amazing true story of Inez de Suarez, the only woman along the spanish conquistadores that conquered the most remote part of south america."
2,Beginning knitter...these are awkward compared to Denise.,"I'm a super beginning knitter but I've been lucky enough to have a teacher that allowed me to use her Denise circular needles (or unlucky since it spoiled me - haha). I love how much easier circulars are to handle compared to the old fashion 'stick' type needles. Unfortunately these replace the stick problem with a hard to handle and in the way plastic cable. It's in the way, it won't move, the stitches don't move smoothly from the needles to the cable. It's just cheaply made and it really takes away any advantage of circular needles over the sticks. I guess I'll have to save up for the $55 Denise needles. You get what you pay for!"
3,Got three needles,Good set of needles for the price. If you have problems with the cable just heat it with hairdryer. It would have been nice if it was advertised that I was going to be getting 3 needles not one. Now I have 4 circular needles total in my stash that are all the same size.
5,The Duration and Six Months: Letters of a WWII Army Nurse,"The letters presented in this book offer a unique look at the day to day life of an Army nurse during WWII. Jerry's sense of adventure, dedication to her profession and her country,and the love for her family are expressed in detailed, heartfelt letters.I highly recommend this special book. It is a loving tribute to the women who devoted a large part of their lives to the war effort."
1,Why even listen?,"This cd is horrible, it was funny to listen to them trying to imitate Mudvayne. The music is decent, but the vocals are horrible. When masterpieces are writen, don't try to copy them or do a tribute, just let them be."
1,im so dumb,"again i buy a cd just to figure out that it isnt even the band on the label. this sucks. if you buy this cd, keep the reciept because youre gonna need it."
4,A Long Road I'll Walk Again & Again,Thank God some people still have great taste in Music to even out those who have no taste at all! Nickelback... Know that we're out here! This CD kicks A**. Nickelbacks true talent shines in this album and how anyone who was ever a Nickelback fan couldn't love The Long Road is beyond understanding! True Nickelback fans you won't be disapointed! Nickelback... THANKS!
4,real rock n roll,"this is what rock music is supposed to sound like, I heard ""feelin' way too damn good"" and ""figured you out"" on the radio and actually wasn't sure what band it was, not that is a bad thing, I'm not real good at names, but was just stunned at how good the songs sounded compared to most of the crap on the radio. I am not sure I would classify Nickelback as grunge, but they are a very good rock band, Maybe borderline grunge (smile)"
1,Formula rock for the masses,"Nickleback is Clear Channel's best friend: their music is ordinary, dull, and absolutely defining mainstream. The songs here are all the same, with poor lyrics, and Chad's standard, ordinary singing style. Sorry about using ordinary so many times, it just defines this band so well.I find it hilarious that ""A kid's review"" was chosen as a spotlight review, because he/she defines the average radio-listening, Nickleback fan. What I hate about bands like this is that they take away radio time to expose bands that deserve our attention.Anybody with brains should turn this off and listen to real talent like In Flames. If you must listen to a radio-dominated band, at least listen to A Perfect Circle, Tool, Nine inch nails, Muse, Metallica (pre-St. Anger), or anything elsewith substance. By the way, try looping ""Someday"" alongside ""How You Remind Me,"" you'll see how Nickleback has produced two almost identical songs, caused by their radio-friendly formulaic song writing skills."
1,Proof That The Radio Is The Black Hole Of Music,"I noticed that almost every band on the radio sounds alike. All rap sounds alike. All diva-pop sounds alike. And all radio rock sounds alike.I decided to download the ""How You Remind Me/Someday"" mp3 onto my computer for the fun of it, and I was laughing. Both songs have the same BPM, the same chord changes, wow, and I thought Creed was terrible enough.The rest of the CD isn't any good either. ""Because Of You"" sounds like something ripped off Metallica's ""St. Anger"", and ""Figured You Out"" has some of the most mundane lyrics ever.Nickelback's new album, ""All The Right Reasons"", hits stores really soon. Expect one of the songs to sound exactly like one of their older songs. Nickelback is a joke and a disgrace to Canadian music. Hopefully they will realize how terrible their songwriting skills are and retire from the music business."
1,this album blows,"If you want to blow chucks for over 60 minutes, get this album. Crappy modern-rock with a cocky lead singer who can't sing if he had to save his life. This is an insult to rock music. I shudder at the thought that this is not their first album ... ugh, and we all though Creed was bad...this is by far the worst rock band ever. Save your money and buy a CD worth while like Pearl Jam's 'Ten' or Soundgarden's 'Superunknown' because this is garbage."
1,Figured You Out,"I just heard the song ""Figured you out"" last week - June of 07'. I was flipping around on my car radio, and stopped on this song cause it totally rocked! But, once I payed attention to the lyrics, I was appalled they were playiing this song at 1pm in the afternoon! This song is degrading to women - it promotes sexual violence and applauds a female who is submissive and has low self esteem. How can we as a society say it's okay for radio stations to play a song like this, especially during hours most children could be listening. Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed in Nickelback for writing this song - as well as the new song ""Rockstar"". Shame on you guys. You may not have asked to be role models, but you are now. Show some integrity and live up to it."
5,THE LONG ROAD,this cd has some good songS but some bad ones tooFAVORITES 1 FLAT ON THE FLOOR3 SOMDAY8 SHOULDNT LISTEN5 FEEL WAY TO DAMN GOOD7 FIGURED YOU OUTBAD ONES 2 DO THIS ANYMORE 4 BELEVE IT OR NOT AND THROW YOURSELF AWAYOVERALL THIS IS A GOOD CD IF YOU LIKE NICKEL BACK LIKE ME THEN YOU SHOULD BUY IT
1,bad,"terrible, i heard a recording of ""someday"" and ""how you remind me"" being played over each other with the same beat, structure, everything. the verses, choruses, bridge, and guitar solo were exactly the same. too formulaic, listen to radiohead, the smiths or the pixies instead."
4,"More of the same, and i still love it","I was a big fan of 'Silver side up', and i anticipated the next chapter in nickelback and i wasnt disapointed. Like every new music played for the first time i didnt find allot of it catchy but after listening to it for about a day i was totally hooked'The Long Road' starts off with a bang with flat on the floor and if you didnt know who were listening to you'd know instantly because of the style nickelback play. That was probably the only down side to the album, allot of it sounds basically the same but after the success of silver side up, i think they wanted mostly the same success with the same kind of music.Three quarters of the tracks i love, including do this anymore, someday and feelin way too damn good so if you liked silver side up and want more, nickelbacks new one is the next album you should buy."
1,Pathetic,"Actually, there are no words to describe how bad it is.Anyone claiming this piece of trash ""rocks"" just doesn't know any better.Don't embarass yourself cos' in a few years you'll be ashamed to admit you actually PAID for it.There are thousands of great bands starving, making great, great music, waiting to be discovered and you make this crappy bunch rich?? What's wrong with you,people..."
1,Brilliant market researched product,"Nobody gets on the radio without the backing of a major label who spend on average $300,000 per song per ""artist"". ALL music heard on commercial radio has been extensively market researched using focus groups. So the music you hear on radio is deliberately chosen, if not designed, to appeal to the most people in the demographic that is being marketed to. Because so much money is at stake both in terms of profit and promotion, major record companies are interested not in music, but in moving product. Art and integrity don't matter, only sales. That is why we have bland, musical junkfood like Nickleback's The Long Road clogging up the airwaves. And it's only going to get worse as more and more radio stations or marketing outlets are owned by fewer and fewer corporations. Art by committee sucks folks. As a marketing device Nickleback are brilliant, as music they stink on ice. This is about as mindlessly commercial as it gets."
1,pray for coconuts.,"listening to a Nickelback cd is not unlike having a maniac dismember you with a rusty, dull blade. It is a horrifying, brutal experience and the best part is when it is over. Shame on anyone who likes this band."
1,Overrated and unoriginal,"Heard good things about the new Nickelback album. I must say however,it's no good. I can't comprehend how some people say how good it is,I find it quite the bore!To each there own I guess.The opening track is quite good,and 'someday' is excellent,however after that the album lacks originality and melody. Loud guitars are good when they are purposeful,not just whacked in for the sake of it.Give it a miss if you're not a Nickelback fan."
5,Nickelback follows last album with Long Road!,"After a major sucess with Silver Side Up, Nickelback does it again with The Long Road. This album is great because it mixes so many things toether. There are songs that are pretty much heavy metal, but some of the songs(Someday, Feelin' Too Damn Good)are softer. They are all good songs with great bonus tracks. Nickelback does a remake to ""Saturday Night's Alright (for fighting) by Elton John which s great. They stick to the song and do a great job of using the same words. They also put in the song from the Scorpion King soundtrack. There are many good things about this album. It is a must have.NICKELBACK DOES IT AGAIN!"
4,Vinyl siding can be stapled,"Contrary to one reviewer, most siding manufacturers allow for stapling of vinyl siding if done according to their specs. This attachment is designed to meet those specs by holding the staple out so as to allow for movement of the siding due to expansion and contraction."
4,I like these pans,"I got these pans as replacements. They heat fast and are good for warming things up. There are no tops so if you are boiling water or something like that it can run out fast, Once you burn these pans they are never the same. I did just that but besides that the pans wear well."
4,Takes you back to the 80's,"This book & the one before it takes you back...they are fun reads. I enjoyed the follow up with the characters & dare to say it was just as good, if not better than the original"
4,I really like this stapler!!!,"I haven't used my new stapler very long, but it seems to work flawlessly. For the price, I don't think you could go wrong buying a Porter-Cable prod. At my job, I use a Bostich stapler a lot, it has the mag. body, but does not seem to perform any better.......Brownsboro, TX."
5,At Last!,"In this book author Marc Lesser has - at last - bridged two worlds that need to meet! Lesser is an ordained zen priest and a CEO of the innovative greeting card company Brushdance. His book demonstrates how to go about weaving the equanimity of zen practice into the stressed out world of work. With great clarity Lesser cites real world examples connected to his dual practices to illustrate key principles in destressing work. It is a refreshing point of view. --L, San Francisco"
2,Disappointing,This was more about zen practice and ethics than it was about business administration. I was disappointed. You may not be.
4,loved the show,"I loved the show American Juniors and I loved most of the songs on the album. But I don't think ""One Step Closer"" was a good remake. I think the song was best sung orignally by ""S Club Juniors"" now ""S Club 8"" if you get a chance check out their version of the song."
2,Pitiful,"Let's be honest here. This cd sucks. No one can carry a tune even after being enhanced in a recording studio. I crinched while listening to the songs. I am no fan of this group although one person stands out, Danielle White. She is the only one who can really sing without sounding amateur. She should take lead vocals for the entire group or just leave the group and go on solo."
1,Just shy of child labour exploitation,"Here are a whole series of E! True Hollywood stories just waiting to happen in about 10-15 years.My headline just about says it all. Sure, the kids'll be paid better than third-world laborers. But realistically, for every buck the kids in this group get, the producers of the show and album will be raking in $100.00.At least the performers on Kidz Bop Kids series maintain anonymity. The American Juniors will be identified as such for the rest of their lives.Not only that, but there is supposed to be a follow-up album where the American Juniors become the world's youngest tribute band: every track on the next album is a cover of the UK bands S Club 7 or S Club Juniors."
1,track 1,im from the uk nd aint got this cd but i have 2 say sumfin bout track 1 nd sum other tracks ive heard of on other aj cds - hus big idea was it 4 aj 2 copy s club? u cant do that
5,Life of the Party- The Ultimate Party and Traveling CD,"I am really enjoying this CD. I am Joe's best friend and fan. I have been knowing him for the past fifteen years and I have had the pleasure of seeing him grow personally and professionally. This is some of his best work. Be a part of history by purchasing this CD and sharing this phenomenal musician's talent with family and friends. I was at the album release party on February 5th in Nashville and I was moved by the five star performance. I told Joe and his wife that the show was one the best shows that I have ever seen. Meanwhile, the CD is slammin'. I like Donnell Jones' (""You Know What's Up""), Erika Badu's (""Didn't Cha Know"") and Alisha Keys'(You Don't Know My Name"") tones. I played it in the barbershop Saturday and everyone wanted it. Please go out and get the CD. Joe's CD is right up there with Norman Brown and Kirk Whalum's debut CDs. It is a must have for people who like Urban Jazz."
4,"""Life of the Party"" is the life of the party","I must say that I get excited every time I find an indie project that just blows me away! This happens to be one of those projects. While it is just cover tunes for great recent R&B hits like ""Sumthin Sumthin,"" ""U Know What's Up,"" and others. I just really like these as my get started tracks for my day. Definitely worth the investment."
2,a little too fantastic,I enjoyed the first two books in this series but Iron Council is just a little too fantastic for my taste. I am able to follow a complex plot but there has to be some degree of believability for the book to be entertaining. Not nesessarily believability of the setting or plot but something I can find in the characters that I can at least identify with. The characters in Iron Council are all so grim and compromised in every way that it was depressing to open the book.I found my mind wandering as I read and I was looking forward to the end.
3,Another China book....,"I'll keep it short but sweet...It's a China book, that about sums it up. It has all the China tweaks, superb story telling and world building, difficult prose, over-used words, and page after page of useless imagery.I know that sounds harsh, but I've read every novel (well, Fiction novel) by China, and the only one that doesn't fit this cardboard container is King Rat (and somewhat Perdido). I'm not saying that's bad, hey; if you dig how many shades of white snow can be, rock on...All in all, this is a homosexual love story."
2,struggling to finish it,"Only about 1/4 of the way through, so mabybe this is premature, but jeez, Perdido was so amazing (5 stars) and Scar was nearly as good (4 stars).The incredible prose from the prior novels seems watered down here. And the obsession with the sexual proclivities of Cutter don't add to much of anything [to the story] that I can tell. I'm no prude and not biased; just seemed overdone.I'll finish it, but unlike the other books it's not a story that I just can't wait to continue reading.Perhaps it's time for Mieville to drop New Crobuzon and start afresh.For those that would say I'm missing the point (yes, I know about the socialism and my political leanings are likely close to Mieville's), I don't care about that if it's not a good story. I bought this to be entertained, not for socio-political lessons. I buy different books for that."
2,Not as Well Crafted...,"I loved Perdido Street Station, and thought the Scar was quite good, but this one is a real slog. There's very little suspense, and it seems more like a musing rumination than a novel. I sure hope his next will be better."
1,"What, exactly, is the point?","Almost completely unreadable. The author's prose obscures the landscape rather than describes it. The characters are stock figures from role playing games. The rhythm of the prose never varies, always landing on the downbeat. The author doesn't seem to want to share his vision as much as he wants to impress the reader with his vocabulary. He neglects the purpose of storytelling.The novel is filled with scenes of vividly described violence that do not further the plot, and sometimes characters seem to exist simply to provide bodies for the author to mutilate. The reader is left with a hazy landscape populated by two-dimensional characters that die in awful ways for no discernible reason than to acquire experience points.I agree with another reviewer - this novel should never have gotten past the editor."
1,"As bad as ""The Scar"" was good","If this had been the first book I had read by Mieville, I would never have picked up another. Plot-driven, with a handful of poorly sketched out characters we never come to care about, and a plot that is deliberately left murky long past the point where the reader no longer cares. Every sentence has both a metaphor and a made-up word in it, making for hard slogging through pretension. I put the book down with 40 pages left to go and almost didn't pick it up again; however, I finally relented and read the purported climax when stuck in an airport. If this book had been better written, it would have been a Stephen King novel -- which is still about 30 levels below what Mieville is capable of.All that being said, ""The Scar"" is a jewel, surely one of the best books in the genre that I have read in fifteen years. Mieville is a young writer and some unevenness is to be expected. I'm looking forward to his next book and hoping that he recaptures some of his magic."
3,4 in a pack no more,Product DescriptionEZ Levelers - 4 Pack10 blocks per set.This lead to believe that i was getting ten in a pack times 4. i guest my mistake o well. live an learn. we will try these out soon. i will let everyone know if we like them. the 3 stars are because of my confusion.
3,Wrong Size,"These forms are only about 3/4"" not 1"" as advertised. This is from the description: Product Dimensions: 1 x 3.6 x 6 inches. Have no clue what the 3.6 represents for a cylinder but they are not 1"" in diameter."
5,"love, love, love","I had just purchased the Rosetta Stone homeschool version- French for my 7 year old. I was on the look out for reinforcing materials as well as introducing the language to my 2 yr old as well. This was perfect. I tend to steer away from fast paced, intense television for the toddler stages so the idea of a simple, musical DVD was appealing. It's effective while holding her attention and captivating with cute little ""panda antics"" and skits in between short lessons. She has her favorite segments and has already shown favortisms which I expect to change with time and advancement. I've caught my 7 yr old staying in tuned with the videos yet grows tired of the slow moving video. However, the simplicity is catchy and it is hard not to pick up on learning. Imagery of words and action is provided while auditory is given through a well enunciated woman's voice. The cartoon-panda breaks up the lesson and also speaks in french almost encouraging the my toddler to engage and ""copy""."
3,Very poor intonation...Ansermet is better.,"Not quite sure what the fuss is..there is alot of stuff easy to condemn in this performance. Firstly the intonation throughout is very sloppy and in some places too much for one person to stomach. Musically everything is very good...however, the Scheherazade is simply not as good as many other versions out there. Try the Maazel in Berlin on DG to compare...even the Leinsdorf with Hollywood Bowl is better. The London Symphony is clearly not on top of it's form here."
3,Not too crazy about the taste,"I looked into mass meal because i was taking a break from Muscle Milk and it was cheaper. A lot of people do like this product and compare it to Muscle Milk in terms of taste (I picked the Chocolate flavor), however I find Muscle milk taste to be much better, even if it has a bit more fat."
4,Genius for only $139,"See, this is what I mean when I complain that there really is only one person who can be counted on to revolutionize the way we transport slurry. Really, K.C. Wilson is a genius!!! GENIUS!!! GeNiUs!!! I can't say it enough.Who would ever have thunk that you could push slurry around using centrifugal pumps. George Bush has mislead the American public and slurry handlers for years, and now we know better.I have only one complaint - this really shouldn't be in paperback at all. Get the hardcover edition - you'll be turning to this volume three, four, even five times a day.And be sure to read every page, because when your friends find out you possess this knowledge, they will be all over you like white on rice. You'll then need to know everything there is to know about hooking up those centrifugal pumps to transport all the slurry they will be creating.Geez, where was this enlightened, refreshing, essential tomb when I needed it most?"
5,Serena Mattthews is amazing!,"I discovered Serena Matthews a long time ago, and I'm thrilled to see her name actually come up when I search for it on Amazon! Her voice is like no one elses, and every song has passion and emotion behind it. Her voice is kind of raw, but soulful, too. Her songs speak to your soul, and leave you inspired. I am a huge fan!!"
3,A far out thriller,"The author's earlier books were fast paced thrillers with crisp dialog and interesting characters. ""Prayers"" is a thriller with an underlying political message. The United States succumbs to and embraces Isalamic rule because Mossad agents allegedly set off nuclear bombs in two major US cities and Mecca? That is pretty far fetched. If you can accept that premise, hard as it is, then this is a fairly good thriller although not nearly on par with his earlier novels. The characters are not very likable and it is pretty easy to figure out the ending. There are some riveting moments and some interesting theories about a democratic superpower split into several warring factions. I'd wait for the paperback."
2,Maybe I'm in the minority.....,"...but I read the first 75 pages and found this book to be completely implausible. Societies do not change as quickly as the author posits. The US is still healing wounds from the Civil War 150 years ago and he suggests we will break apart into a new society in the next 25 with current blue-states becoming pro-Islamic. ....No way. The more I think about it, the less sense it makes."
3,Ho-hum Characters in a Brilliant Exotic Background,"Ths is a stock thriller with super macho characters but the background and the geography through which they move is the most original I have seen in many years. The entire story, set in the not very distant future, takes place in The Islamic States of America. That is what the good old USA becomes after New York City, Washington and Mecca are nuked into rubble. The characters move through an interesting and scarey conservative Islamic world. Take it from there. Creating such a background is a difficult task done well here. The problem: I couldn't care about the characters."
3,Decent but...,"It was an ok time killer for a flight, but that's about all it is. I give it a third star because it might give some readers a sense of what it would be like to live in an Islamic America."
1,A silly book showing the authors ignorance with the subject matter,"Not only is the book badly written, the author clearly has no idea about Islam. Even when writing fiction, one needs some level of knowledge about the subject matter. Check out his ""plog"" right here on Amazon.com even. He thinks Muslim girls wear ""habibs"" over their heads! You will find the book full of silly errors and inaccuracies like this which have nothing to do with the fact that the book is fiction but show that the author just didn't care about reading up and took his readers for morons.Don't bother with this book; it is a waste of time and money."
4,picture frame staples,"These worked just fine for what we bought them for...making picture frames. At times we wish they were a little more sturdy, but with wood glue and the staples we were golden"
4,"Great music, but Tracks Listed on back incorrect.","The back of the CD lists the following ten tracks:#1: let me say#2: what God says#3: the law of love#4: deep & wide#5: get away#6: You've got everything#7: don't turn your back#8: spin#9: Cassie's song#10: Amazing Grace""Amazing Grace"" is not on the CD. However, inserted between ""You've got everything"" and ""don't turn your back"" is the track ""our God reigns"".So, you have ten tracks, but not the ten listed. All are great songs, however.I'd have given it 5 stars had the track information been correct.This is not what was actually on the CD."
1,wafer paper,Well from the reviews I ordered it...NEVER AGAIN. One user said taste good. ..YOUR KIDDING RIGHT? Horrible taste like brown paper bag and when you cut cake image pulls into cake...not good...
2,buyer beware,I love AFI alot and it blinded me to buy this CD. These are the worest bands i've herd in a long time. the do a pittful job of trying to recreate these songs(if thats what they were trying to do). It sounds exactlly the same except done by people with crap voices. And the girls butcher all life from these otherwise wonderful songs. please save yourself and buy Black Sails in the Sunset.
1,Horribly horribly horribly bad,"As a long-time fan of AFI, I wanted to like this album. Honestly, though, it is truly horrific. The covers either sound like poorly-played note-for-note reproductions of the originals with a different vocalist or they completely abolish any spirit of the original that they could have had, turning the experience of listening to it to a drudgery. What's more, at least one of the bands (the Independents) have been quoted as saying they don't even like AFI; they just did it for the money. I've liked the Independents for a long time, but this is -not- the way to do a tribute album.If I could give this thing 0 stars, I would."
5,Ol' skool,"When i noticed ""The Honeymooners"" on your site, it took me back many years when enjoying Jackie Gleason was mandatory early on in TV. These are the best episodes bar none..."
5,The Honeymooners Holy Grail!,"The Honeymooners is the best situation comedy ever made for TV. Here are the ""classic 39"" in all their pristine glory! Never again will you have to stay up late to catch reruns! Now you can enjoy the hilarious, timeless antics of Ralph, Alice, Ed and Trixie any time you want.A couple of the episodes have low sound levels and ""TV Or Not TV"" has a scratch line running down the left side of the screen for the entire episode.The nice thing is that every episode is complete and uncut, rather than the hacked-to-bits versions shown on TV for the last 50 years.Despite the minor flaws of this set I highly recommend it to all comedy fans.Helloooo ball!"
4,Away we Go,"Foo fans of Thee Origanal 39 this is a must for the avid Honeymooners fan, Nice Packaging and Bonus Origanal Opening and ending,also includes the Anniversary Special hosted by Jane Meadows. Only Caveat is you cant hit play all, you have to hit play for each episode which I found dis-appointing,other than that this is Televison at it's Golden age! must have for collecter's of 50's era Television"
5,EXCELLENT,the honeymooners clasic dvd was great!!!!! if your are a fan you would love this dvd collection the clarity was great it was as if it was just airing and the price for this collection i couldnt find it cheaper anywhere...i say get it for hours of laughter and to show the next generation what a great show should conist of.
5,Classic Honeymooners,"This is an excellent collection of the classic Honeymooners episodes. I don't have to tell you how great Jackie Gleason and Co were, this is comedy at its height of cleverness and reflects the more humorous side of the day to day life we can all relate to. Just reading the DVD jacket and looking at the carefully selected stills pictured is enough to send you down memory lane and remind you of all those great episodes and pick the one you want to watch next. Highly recommended and worth every penny. I looked all over to get the best price before buying it here."
2,IM Confused Vhs or Dvd,i already got the classic 39 collection set but im wondering why u call this a dvd box set if its a vhs video tapes box set i dont understand it is good it is clear and all but im confused
3,39 Episodes Minus 2,"I echo what a lot have already said. I had to turn my TV sound up almostfull to hear TV or Not TV. I have this episode on VHS, and it is very goodso I know that the episode is okay. The transfer to DVD was not. Also, theepisode Please Leave the Premises seems like it was done from cable TV.Near the end of the episode, the episode goes into slow motion, with thepicture breaking up, such as when your cable starts acting up. It is SOBAD that they actually write the dialogue on the screen!! Didn't anybodycheck these transfers? If the transfer was that bad that the dialogue hadto be written on the screen, you would think that they would have doneit over. Other than that, the other 37 episodes seemed okay, but I agreewith the others, this series should have been digitally remastered beforeit was put on DVD. My VHS tapes are better."
3,"Limited to 2000 files, do not waste money buying 2GB cards","Just want to confirm that COBY's guys cannot count above 2000. This is their limit for number of files they will display. I bought two frames for my relatives and wasted money buying number of 2GB SD cards for them. Copied about 4000 pics to each SD, fortunately, before sending the frames checked the pics on them... Bummer! Only first 2000 are visible on each. Verified with a USB drive - same! Why didn't they mention this limit in the specs?Other than that, this is a good frame."
4,Coby DP882 or DP-882,"Note: It appears that Amazon has lumped several different Coby models under this thread, so be careful that the review you read is really associated with the correct frame.Only have few negative comments: 1) you cannot run a slideshow on a specific directory of pictures. If you have three directories of pictures, it will play all of them. 2) No setup option to force pictures to rotate in slideshow. You can manually rotate still pics, but if you plan on displaying a bunch of vertical portraits, you will want to rotate them on your PC before playing them on the frame. 3) Forget playing video on this thing - the decoder is not efficient, so the .avi's are choppy.Positives: Easy to get started, 800 x 600 resolution is crisp, bright, easy to navigate with remote, fast image transition with choice of effects, music control during slideshow, clear menus and setup options."
2,Unable to get past the religious influence,"After a friend's suggestion of what an amazing book this was, I bought it through Amazon. He told me to skip the first couple chapters. The chapter I started on made some sense and I was able to identify with some of it. Unfortunately, there was too much religious references for me to continue reading through more than a couple chapters. Best of luck to you!"
2,"20,000 ft. view","I was hoping to get insights from the mind of an interior design artist. My disappointment grew as I made my way through the book. I did not once stop to ponder on advice that was given, I read about simplistic rules, ""the use of space is important"", ""functionality over conventionality"". The book is filled with photos but no unifying text that brings a flow of ideas. I would only recommend this book if you want a condensed ""how-not-to"" book. Otherwise, keep browsing and please let us know of any good finds."
3,only worth it for collector,"This would only be worth the $12.99 if you are a collector of Goldfrapp's singles. The DFA remix of ""Slide In"" is decent, laid-back, and funky. But if you like DFA, LCD Soundsystem, etc., this track can be found on the album, The DFA Remixes: Chapter Two."
4,WALT LONGMIRE SERIES,"I enjoy the Longmire series. I have read all but two of the books. They are a little slow to get into, but I expect that is how the character, Walt Longmire is - slow and methodical."
5,Nam Revisited,"Anothers man's moccasins, represents a story that intertwines numerous chacters while reliving a past event in the Sheriff's life. These flashbacks to Nam and the language used, caused me to relive my own stories of Nam and I too was able to cope with these old demons.. The author's realism about the past and present keep your interest throughout the book. Some people have dreams, others never came home and some drop out of life as we know it. This book personafies that urge and while solving one mystery the Sheriff finds solace in his past. I can't say the author is a Nam Vet but he must have good advisor. The way the author uses the Indian influence only enhanced my liking these books. I am student of Indian LOre and understand the bond between Henry and Longmire, the author plays the two beautifully in the books.The plot is real, today and believable, to be able to keep a story moving is a great art."
3,Poor quality,The quality of this costume is very poor. The buttons came apart even as I my son was trying to wear it for the first time. However my 7 year old son loved this costume
2,Two sisters I could do without,This is a novel with the chick-lit genre in mind. It's so predictable it's almost painful. The only thing I enjoyed about this book was that it was a quick read. Look elsewhere to be entertained....
3,Read it then give it to your sister,"I am a sucker for All Things Austen, so the 'modern day Sense & Sensibility' description lured me right in. I have always fancied myself an ""Elinor"", not a ""Marianne"", so imagine my surprise when my beloved little sister, to whom I gave this book - told me that she was amazed how much the Eliza character reminded her of me. If anything, it gave me a reason to reread S&S in order to glean some insight into my sister's meaning. This was a fun book, but not as well written as other more popular ChickLit books. It will however make you laugh, and will remind you how crazy your parents are, that men are only human, and that your sister will always be your very best friend."
1,Shallow,"Well, at least it was a short book. The story was shallow and the characters were--every one of them-way too self absorbed for me! An unbelievable plot as well. If you must read it, borrow it. Don't waste your money."
3,Entertaining reading,"Any book that includes a character who's writing a dissertation on the food in Barbara Pym novels deserves praise. This book will not change anyone's life, but when you're tired of reading books that grapple with Great Big Serious Issues, this is perfect-- it's funny and absorbing without being irritating, as a lot of novels covering this same territory can be (see: Bridget Jones Diary). Also nice: the men in this book aren't caricatures...and the Ferber parents are great characters."
1,About as heavy as an empty coffee cup,"I prefer books that deal with matters more serious, substantial, and complex. The world of naval-gazing is alive and well in this novel. The ha ha idea of studying toast in the English novel about sums up the depth of this book. Perhaps it is pleasing to those whose lives never lift beyond their own self-centeredness. If that's what you like, here's your book. The people in this novel are like the people you see in Starbucks chatting endlessly about every stupid and trivial detail of their lives."
5,An auspicious first novel,"It is a privilege to experience a first novel like The Perfect Elizabeth. The book is articulate, charming, entertaining and had me wishing I'd had a sister."
2,Dim lighting,"I had such high hopes for this mirror, especially because it's so expensive. It's flimsy and loose at the joint so you can't really adjust the height or angle very well. It's only one sided so there's no full view side. I wouldn't have minded that so much, but the worst part was how dim the lighting was. Just a little 4 watt bulb lights this thing and it's a joke. unfortunately, the poor lighting makes this mirror useless."
4,Very good cd...,"Very good cd, not as thrilling as vol. 2 though... wonder why. A must buy, keeps the legacy going."
4,"Nice quality, easy to remove","These are good quality staples. My Porter Cable stapler drives them all the way into hardwood yet they are easy to pull out with a staple remover if needed. They don't break off. The only reason I gave them four stars was because the price is a bit high. I found the same staples for a little more than half this price at a local upholstery supply store, but if you don't have a local source the price is still pretty good."
2,My mistake,I would have ordered another CD but by mistake I ordered the above which I do not like that much
4,best baseball game on earth,this is my favorite baseball game and if u get it it will be yours to the only thing i dont like when you look in florida marlins a aa aaa there is no d train not that i like the marlins i just want hem to be on the yankees my advice you buy the game and play it on xbox live
3,Laura Geller Balance and Brighten,I had read fabulous reviews and I had hoped this would be more illuminating.
4,Great Little Book,"The recipes are interesting and easy with sample menus. This would be a great book to put into a gift picnic basket and then give it to a friend. I'm looking forward to trying the grilled chicken kabobs with peach salsa. The herbed green beans with mozzarella and prosciutto look great, too."
5,Drive this into 'ya!,"Can TPB really be as good as everyone says? Absolutely -- this comedy is sweet, profane, violent, charming, it hits every mark. Holds up to repeated viewing like nothing else. It's amazing that this genius saga isn't more well known in the States. TPB insiders say Comedy Central wanted to distribute it censored, and the show's producers balked. That integrity comes out in every faced of TPB, from the acting to the writing, it's all there and it never cops out on itself.Fifty Shades of Trailer Park Boys: TPB in the Great Comedic Traditions"
5,Love the Trailer Park Boys and this has most of it.,"I love this show and haven't found anything to top it. Goofy, silly, and uniquely charming, everyone who is a character in this show is not good or bad, just a human living life. It is because of the constant dynamic of the persona of these characters that I find this show to be so great despite not having funding compared to shows like CSI or Big Bang Theory. The only thing missing from this pack is the Xmas episode but that is not the biggest deal since all 7 seasons are there in their glory."
2,Not as comfortable as i would have liked,"I bought these sandals a few years ago and was disappointed in the comfort factor. Too bad, it's a good brand."
1,The Teasing Trouble,"I am a 7 year old boy and I just finished the book in 2 days. It was a good book!! Now we are going to talk about the book.Well, this book was about this boy (Spencer) and girl (Halley). Spencer was teasing Halley and she got very angry at Spencer.Halley called Spencer a bully. Spencer calls Halley a baby. First they're are not friends and then they are friends again. Buy this book for your child and they will like. This book has 48 pags. Your child will learn right and wrong. thank you."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought these at my local Safeway (1# bag = 3.99) and ended up returning them the very next day. The color of the ""wasabi"" coating was not appetizing, which should have clued me in before even opening the bag. There wasn't much to them, and what ""flavor"" they did have, barely resembled wasabi. In fact, to me, it tasted of chemicals, however the other reviewer thought it was a cheap soy sauce; regardless, they were disappointing."
4,"Great price, great service!","I would have rated this a ""5 Star"" but haven't used this battery yet. I bought it as a ""back-up"" battery for my camera and couldn't have been happier with the price and fast delivery.Thanks!"
2,Playing Card Holders,"Great idea these playing card holders, but not very sturdy springs inside of them, the spring in one is so loose that the cards slide around in it. I bought two packs to have 8 for use when playing with friends. They work fine, but I don't think they will last long. It is a great idea for holding a hand full of a dozen cards when needed for some games."
4,Hollow Grind Chef's Knife,"Nicely made, cool retro look, most importantly works well- hollow sections release sliced products- I thought Mundial mostly made lower end cutlery, but we anticipate years of use from this product- all my cooks want one!"
1,This changer sucks XXXX,"I purchased it about one nad half month ago.From the first day, the tray does not work smoothly.Jamming, error, and .......... happens almost every time I use it. I went to a eceltronic dealer to check out the same model. The demo unit has similar problem.Whilw this player does produce good sound quality, the loading and reading units are just not reliable.Don't buy!!"
1,Would not purchase again...,"This unit crapped out on me after only 3 years and only limited play. The carousel always seemed as though it would break at anytime, although it still worked. The CDs just weren't being read correctly or with any consistency. I took it back to where I purchased it (Hi Fi Fo Fum in STL) they said they could look at it for $70. I only paid $189. They were ready to sell me the newer model of Denon, but I think I'll try another brand. I told them to throw it away."
2,Great execution on a bad idea,"This product does exactly what it says it will, and does it extremely well. This is a powerful sander which produces very little dust.However, after two days of experimentation, I could not control the device to the point that I wasn't dinging, gouging, and scraping too much mud (or the paper) off the drywall. This thing cost me way more time than it saved me. If I were a professional I might consider investing in this, as then I might be able to figure out how to use it effectively. As a do-it-yourselfer I have been having far better results and just as little dust with hand tools. The Hyde Dust Dog Pole Sander Kit for Dustless Drywall Sanding and the Marshalltown DuraSoft Dustless Drywall Vacuum Sander cost far, far less and give more predictable results. Yes, it takes a little more elbow grease, but it gives far better results and ends up taking a heck of a lot less time than going back and fixing the scrapes again and again."
3,Nice introduction/summary,"If you are looking for an indepth analysis of the strategy and tactics of 20th century battles, then this book isn't for you. Instead, what this book does well is give an overview of some of the major battles in the 20th century. Some of the descriptions are better than others as the authors/sources vary, but in general this book is a good place to begin a study of modern combat. It gives a good reference point from which a more detailed study/investigation can be made via other sources."
4,Highlander Kicks...!!,"Highlander the series kicks *** At first I thought it would be lame but now I'm hooked. The travels and adventures of Duncan Mcleod have captivated me. I thought it was good of them to pick up where the movies left off, but I was really bummed to hear of the cancellation of the series on the U.S.A. network. Also I have come to find out that the sci-fi channel will be airing all episode from all of the seasons in chronological order. If you love the series I suggest getting your hands on the Highlander Catalog and buying all three seasons fully uncut and unedited. It will be well worth your money."
2,Misprints galore,"I received this book only to immediately find that there was a large misprint along the binding, proclaiming the book to be ""SoildWorks for Designers Release 2005"". This does not count as a defect for returns, according to the company, so it would have only given me 70% refund or something like that! Besides the large defect on the outside, the text doesn't seem to contain anything that breathtaking, the SolidWorks tutorial in the program seems to cover what I need(and my job is mostly solidworks modeling as an engineer at a startup). I wouldn't recommend you buy this book other than as something to read on an airplane, etc. when you have no access to a computer."
3,"Disappointing following Sharp Edges, but a decent read.","Jasper and Olivia are not great characters. Their relationship is too business-like, not developed as well as in Krentz's previous works. I think she went too fast through this plot and left out some of her talent for intriguing romantic relationships. I hope her next one is a little more complex."
3,An incredibly fast read!,Krentz develops Jasper and Olivia's characters very well from the onset so you really like them throughout the book. The story is kind of weak but the spark between Jasper and Olivia and their lust for success and power keep you interested.
1,Boring !!!!!!!!!!,"Was this a Romance ? I must have miss something along the l-o-n-g road of reading this book. I will not let any friend of mine borrow this book. I have all of Krentz's book, but this one is going in the give away box. What happen,Jayne ?"
3,Beautiful But Not By Original Artists,Just want everyone to know that these instrumentals are not actually performed by the original artists as listed. I was drawn to this while looking up individual MP3 songs and then decided to purchase and download the whole album. It appeared to me that the original artists had redone their hits in a gentler fashion. Instead it's pretty much the same guitarist with nice instrumental backgrounds. Track 10 has a gentle vocal. All the others are instrumental. Lovely music to read by but not what I expected.
2,Robot Chicken Star Wars,"I enjoyed this movie, but it is a little expensive for what you get. If you could find it for around $5.00 that would be a more fitting price."
5,Robot Chicken Rocks,"Can't say enough about this little gem from Robot Chicken, except perhaps I wish it could be longer. If you like Robot Chicken, or Family Guy then this style of short sometimes schizophrenic skits with the Star Wars motif running through them are great for a quick laugh or party!By far one of the best Star Wars parodies ever, and the extras are interesting as well!"
4,A plesant read,This is a nice little piece of science fiction. I suppose it ends up being more a general piece of social commentary but I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it.
5,"Just buy the book, people","I wanted to give the book about a 4.5, but that isn't an option.Basically this is a really good book. I may not necessarily agree with everything the book has to say about this or that, but if you dislike a book because it doesn't back up everything you believe then you've got a problem. In fact, if that describes you, if you are the kind of person who gets all freaked out every time somebody disagrees with you to any degree, then don't buy this book. Because you won't get it.But if, on the other hand, you are the kind of person who actually thinks about his or her life and the consequences of your ideals and beliefs, then this book is right up your ally. Take the time to read and understand every word.So buy it already. I mean, it's only a couple bucks. Alright, fine, I'll loan you the friggin' money, and you can pay me back in monthly installments."
1,Not as good as I thought it would be,"Bought this stockpot with a lot of expectations. I used it for the first time to make soup, and there were scratches all over the bottom. I even used a wooden ladle instead of a metal utensil. I expect quality from Cuisinart cookware and also from quantanium non-stick coatings. I also expected it to be heavier."
2,Poor Quality,The first one that I received leaked where the handle was riveted. Amazon was great about replacing it with free shipping. The replacement's bottom is not level so it rocks on the burner. I also found that it's very light in weight....aaargh!
5,Great pan,"Excellent quality, love the nonstick anodized finish, 6-qt. size, deep shape, heavy duty metal handles, and that it has an ovenproof lid. Great for either stove top or oven roasting."
2,disappointed but my own fault,"Most of my familiarity with this artist involved inspirational/Christian recordings which I had heard over the radio. They were extremely good. I mistakenly, and it was my own fault, just assumed that all of his recordings were similar, so purchased all that I could find. This particular one, however, is just not to my personal liking. I'm sure those who like blues/jazz types will like this, however. I'm just not that type. Even the Amazing Grace song is so jazzed up that I would have to call it secular music style. At any rate, my 2 stars would be zero (for my own personal taste) other than that the artists are excellent musicians. It's just that I write this to inform all to look at the selections of songs before buying any album. If there aren't many on there to your liking, avoid the purchase."
3,Monitor Review,For the money this is a great monitor with accurate color. Don't be fooled however by the claims of being a flat screen (not to be confused with flat panel). It is actually a standard round screen with a flat piece of antireflective glass over it. I would not reccomend this monitor if image geometry is critical. It is a great bargain though if all you need is accurate color.
2,not so great >> 1.5 stars,"This story is not nearly as good as Beyond Control, York's latest. I really had to work hard to finish Crimons Moon. The werewolf and his ""mate"" just didn't have any chemistry. The plot was convoluted and there were too many convenient coincidences to make it suspenseful. The bad guy, Ethridge, was crazy and twisted - I would have liked to see his character developed a little more.Sorry to say, but this one is going to the used book store. If you want to give it a try, buy it used."
3,corney,Didn't care for it. The author went off in different directions and brought up not logical developments. Could have lived without reading it.
2,mix up,"I purchased this mp3 the other day kind of spur of the moment. It's my own fault I didn't pay close attention to the song previews. But what I found after i had bought it (if i can get this correct) were the songs for Vol 2 - Courage, with the song titles and author names that are on Vol 4 - Perserverance, and Amazon's listing says Songs for Sleepless Nights Vol 5 - Joy even though it has the Vol 4 picture. What a mix up! I would like to buy the ""real"" Vol 5 & the ""real"" Vol 4 on mp3 somewhere, but can't find it available. If anyone knows where to buy one please let me know. Thanks!"
3,Nothing Like The Book,"I did myself a injustice by reading the book and then watching the movie. To me, the movie was nothing like the book. The only thing that coincided was the title and the storyline(somewhat). I realize that some things have to be left out when a movie is made from a book. But come on, you don't have to rewrite the story. It just didn't fit. The movie itself was good had I not read the book first. If you've read the book, the movie will be a disappointment! If you haven't read the book, then don't, just see the movie."
3,Does not follow the book,I watched the movie after reading the book. The movie left out a lot of what I believe are important parts. Just would not recommend it when there are many other really good movies out there.
2,Dull as dirt,"This movie was so boring that not even Morgan Freeman could save it, excellent actor that he is. The heroes were dull, and I didn't care what happened to them. Worse, the villains were even duller. In a movie this uninspired, they could have at least thrown in a little gratuitous skin for all the voyeurs out there."
1,The Itsy Bitsy Problem.,"By the time you see the ending, you'll already be wishing that you hadn't watched this movie."
2,Weak and Predictable,"Should have read the reviews before I got this video. About five minutes in, I already knew what would happen. Totally predictable. Freeman is good, he always is. But the plot is more suited to a made-for-TV movie. The plot devices are all wrong (two secret service agents posted full time at the school of an obscure Senator's daughter?; the Russian president's son attends a US private school??; the Washington metro line that runs under Union Station doesn't come out of the ground in Virginia; nobody could run from the Watergate to Union Station in a few minutes in street clothes like Freeman does). Just weak."
3,Confused,"I'm confused because I have no idea why this movie is called ""Along Came a Spider"". Other then having few similar plot twists the movie and the book are two completely different things. I'm not going to go into a huge thing on all the differnces between the book and the movie (that would take forever) but its very dissapointing thing for two reasons: fans of the book are most likely not going to like it. You watch the movie expecting to see one thing and end up getting something you didn't really want to see. The book is soooo good so I don't know why so much was changed and left out. Secondly, the movie really is pretty good, but it won't get the recognition it deserves because of it's title. If you gave the characters new names and slapped on a new title it probably would of been a much more liked movie."
5,Along Came A Spider,Great movie. With lots of thrills and excitement. Also a neat twist to it :) If you liked the other Alex Cross movie Kiss the Girls then you probably like this one too.
4,"Gotta get that spider, great crime film","Okay. The opening plot of the movie has too many holes in it. A car falls over the ledge and hangs on by some wire or whatever and the doctor/detective loses his partner. But this is the ultimate cat and mouse game. The doctor/detective has to figure out who has stolen a little girl from a school. His new partner will help him to try to find the girl, but there's a twist. Watch the movie and you'll see for yourself."
3,Interesting,"I've read some James Patterson books and have watched Kiss the Girls and I like the detective Alex Cross. I enjoy that they have cast Alex with Morgan Freeman as I could not picture Alex with someone like Laurence Fishburn who rocked with the Matrix.I enjoyed seeing Monica Potter in this movie and though the plot twists and turns I hope to see more from her in the future as she has a lot of potential for these kinds of movies (and not like the one she shares cast with Freddy Prince Jr. in which she kind of played a flake).While I liked the cast, I just thought that there was TOO much jam-packed into the movie. Not enough character development to feel the actors out and not enough to sympathize with the situations.I was dissappointed with this movie but hope to see more from Alex Cross and Morgan Freeman should they decide to keep on the James Patterson kick."
4,Excellent health information,"Very good book. It has in depth information on DMG that everyone should know about, especially concerning autism. Everyone will find this a fascinating read."
3,Danny Boy,"Had a very important part of the story missing: scenes showing the antagonists abusive treatment of Danny Boy so that you could understand how they could be sentenced at the end.Would only reluctantly recommend this, because it was not the complete film."
4,"Cute book, but historically inaccurate","Hopkinson has written a clever picture book incorporating tasty recipes, but take the details of Fannie Farmer's life with a grain of salt. Hopkinson has altered the facts to serve her story.Farmer's first cookbook was an update of a cookbook, written by one of her predecessors at the Boston Cooking School, which already incorporated precise measurement using standard measuring cups and spoons. Farmer's contribution was ""level"" measurement (as suggested by Marcia) and kitchen-testing of all the recipes by the school's students and faculty.Read ""Fannie in the Kitchen"" to your child as an introduction to Fannie Farmer. Then read ""Perfection Salad"" by Laura Shapiro to learn the true story."
2,be careful when ordering,"Be very careful when you order to select the color on the small icons. I accidentally ordered the blue because the natural color always stays on the big picture. I sent them an email to change the color the same day since they were closed already, but it shipped the next day with the wrong color. Now I have to wait for it to be delivered and then call UPS to come pick it up again for return."
4,Good read!,Great Christian story about a young girl who changes lives through her strong faith in Jesus Christ and her Heavenly Father.
2,Not sweet enough.,Not as sweet as sugar or Splenda. Had to use quite a bit in my tea. I won't buy again.
1,WARNING: They use CORN for this product,"NOW has a policy to use Non-GMO'd products when possible BUT they can't guarantee that this product is produced from NON-GMO corn. With their low prices and the majority of corn produced in the US is GMO'd, I have to assume it's a GMO'd product. Isn't that just great!!!! And, Amazon has a NO RETURN policy on food items, so I am stuck with it."
1,Cannot review,It has to have been quite sometime since I purchased this item asit is another I do not remember - sorry
1,IS THIS WORTH TRYING TO BE SKINNY?,Erythritol is GMO corn!!!!!!! Does everyone know what that does to you???? Now they're pushin that crap in health food stores. I thought those were sacred places.
2,This is the first time I tried Erythritol,"GROSS. Tastes like salty menthol sugar or something. Might be passable if you're hiding it in something you're baking...but for coffee? NAH. If you don't own a dog, use Xylitol, because Xylitol will kill your dog. If you do own a dog, just be a man and either quit sweeteners all together, or enjoy sugar. Unless you have diabetes, the truth is that most of you will try this sweetener, that sweetener, and eventually end up back at sugar. Sugar CRUSHES Erythritol."
1,Bitter tasting,"After reading the positive reviews I thought I'd give this product a try. I do not know how anyone can say this tastes like sugar. This stuff is awful, the after taste was agonizing. I could smell the difference in the coffee let alone taste it. I am so glad I do not have to use this in place of sugar I was just trying to cut some calories. I am so glad I have alternatives to choose from. It's Splenda for me. The site would not allow me to place the review without giving the product a star but it is a zero in my book."
1,"No gas, my ass!","I purchased this product based on my research on the internet and the reviews on Amazon regarding this product's lack of aftertaste, low glycemic response, and mainly because people stated it had no gastric effects as Xylitol does. I used it this morning in a banana bread recipe. This afternoon I began paying the price and a few minutes later everybody near me began paying the price with me. This impacted my gut exactly the way all sugar alcohols do. I'll be passing this item on to my sister with diabetes. Her meds already tear up her gut so she probably won't notice as much. Back to the drawing board for me."
5,Great Speakers,"I've had a pair of these speakers for over 2.5 years now. They sound absolutely great. I'm golden ears certified, and do high level audio engineering for live bands, and so I am picky about a really clean and crisp sound. These speakers have never disappointed me, and I would recommend them for almost any setup."
3,Chair Dolly DY-9000 Review,"Adequate except for the wheel caps. One came off in the first 5 minutes of use, causing the wheel to fall off.We are going to have to retrofit both units by drilling a hole through the axle, and inserting a cotter pin thatshould have been utilized in the first place."
1,Just like the others,"Western view of history always falls short and this book is no exception. Written from a incomplete view it fails to consider a genuine consideration of all sides. It is written from the common perspective that is enamored with the Japanese.The biased is less noticeable in this book but clear when you consider all the accolades for the Japanese culture and the lack of mentioning of how the Japanese through kidnapping and espionage got to the position to start the war. In other words, it is like the mentioning of the Nazis and how great they were without mentioning any of their heinous acts."
5,Hot Stuff: boom boom!,"The tedium of watching America's top ten poets shift prizes, grants, fight each other and build academic air castles is about as much fun as root canal work without novocaine. Finally Deborah Garrison puts out a volume of poetry that is simply wonderful, gives the reader pleasure and accesses truth as we know it and feel it. What more can you you ever hope for? Thanks you Deborah, for writing! Don't quit, ever!"
5,Check these out,"This is very good poetry: insightful, articulate, and very witty. Garrison is quite deft with the English language and doesn't litter her writing with clever, irrelevant tricks. She keeps her work focused and to the point. She has the snap and sting of Michael Benedikt."
1,the gods must be crazy.,the powers that be in the poetry community should be ashamed of themselves. why in the world hasn't any poet publicly criticized these poems? perhaps the art of criticism is truly dead...or perhaps it has something to do with garrison's position at the new yorker?
3,Nice background music,"I bought this album to listen to while reading and doing other focus-intensive work. For that use the music is very appropriate, but for everyday listening it can be a little slow and boring."
2,Not appropriate for Middle School Students,"Our middle school uses this book, together with the textbook and the videotapes, as its curriculum for teaching French. While the storyline of the two main characters is cute, its subject matter (often involving one man trying to pick up a girl) is more appropriate to older students, not those between the ages of 11 and 13. Because every lesson pulls things out of the dialogue for study, my daughter's class has less of an understanding of French than they might have with a more methodical approach. Concepts are taught seemingly at random,and since very few practice exercises are given, and the instructions are all in French, comprehension is low. This might be a good way to study French for older students or adults, (particularly those who expect to be going to France in the near future) but beware of using it as a method to teach French to anyone younger - it isn't effective."
2,Nature's Elegance Parrot diet,"Would not recommend!!The majority of the 5 lbs bag is composed of tiny seeds (for doves or pigeon), which parrots don't eat."
3,A Colorado Winter by John Fielder,"I was happy with the book itself and John Fielder's work. But the front cover was a disappointment. Of six copies I ordered, the copies showed different stages of yellowing around the edges. But it would not have worked to take the cover off since the cover and title were essential to the design and photography to the hard cover of the book itself."
1,Don't Buy it!,"The series is so much better. This was stupid. There was only Lina, no Gourry, no Zel, or Xellos, and 2, only 2! dragon slaves. NO comic relief---buy the series if you want slayers, and if you have the series, this is just a waste of money."
5,My favorite chutney.,"Anyone who grew up in South Africa loves Mrs. Balls Chutney. I have been living in the USA for twenty years and have tried many chutneys, including many from local Indian Groceries and home-made varieties from speciality stores. Nothing quite beats the taste of this brand. I know many recipes that use this chutney to make a wonderful marinade, or sauce for chicken dishes as well. These recipes can be found on line. I was delighted to find that Amazon had listed this incredible product. I bought six bottles and as soon as they are finished, I know where I can find them again. Either the Regular or the Peach varieties are a family favorite, even amongst my American born children. Thank you Amazon."
3,Decent effort,"This to me was Sin Bandera at their best and at their worst. I recognize that this band has a heavy R&B; influence. I like that. It's really nice and they have the voices to carry it. However, there were four songs on this CD, two with Yung Kuntry and the two versions of Junto a Ti that I did not like. There was too much hip/hop and rap mixed in with it. It kind of reminded me of when I first stopped liking everything Gwen Stefani did just because it was Gwen S.I'm all for an artist experimenting-- that's what makes them artists. However, tastes do differ and I just don't have a taste for rap infused spanish pop. Other than those songs I mentioned, there's the duet with Laura Pausini that is amazing. Suelta mi Mano, Tocame and Que Me Alcance la Vida are vintage Sin Bandera."
4,Manana is Now a great cd!,"Great cd, every song is very good. #7 Suelta Mi Mano is one the best latin songs of 2005."
1,Pointless,This book is written for a grade school dropout. It is absolute garbage. I could say more--but do I really need to? Please don't waste your time or money.
5,Nice book,"Nice pictures. I guess the children found it fun to pose for the more dramatic looking ones specially in those far off days when photography was so unfamiliar. The pictures have a real period charm, and are a contrast to the usual stiff Victorian photos. They are art not just photography."
5,good bag,Having a lot of stuff and tools in my trunk and tools this was a good idea buying it to keep booster cables clean and dry and ready for use.
3,Why does everyone give this 5 stars?,"I bought this along with a pair of jumper cables (fell for the old ""customers who viewed your item also bought"" trick). The bag is nice enough, but realistically not worth the price. I don't understand why everyone gives this 5 stars. If I were walking through a physical store and saw this on the shelf for $7.99, there is not a chance I would have bought it. For the $12.79 price on Amazon and the extremely high reviews, I figured this would be very thick canvas (unbreakable?). Instead, this has the feel that you could rip it apart with your bare hands if you really want to. Oh well, nice enough, I guess."
4,"Sturdy, holds a the larger jumper cables","I have an extra long set of heavy gauge, bulky jumper cables. They've come to the rescue for coworkers and others many times. The box they were in started falling apart, and I was tired of wrestling with it and not having a good way to grab them and move them around when I'm loading/unloading stuff from the trunk of my car. I was a little worried this bag might not hold the larger cables, but they fit just fine. The bag is tough and sturdy. The round shape doesn't snag on junk in the trunk, and the handles make maneuvering the cables out of the way much easier.And when my coworker needs his 20th jump and *still* hasn't purchased his own darn set of cables, I'll feel better about chunking this at his head. :-)"
5,Devil'sPond!!!!!!,"wow i really loved this movie so much it was just as good as i thought it would be its scary, action packed,suspenseful the whole package and tara reids performance was awsome kips was good too if your a big fan of thrillers and of tara reid you will love this movie so much."
1,Dealing WithAnger,I found this over-priced book to be of no use to me at all...the reader was/is expected to do ALL the work while the author offers practically no help nor any self-help roads...
2,James Cameron love-fest.,"I love the general idea of this novel but the excessive gushing from all the characters about how amazing James Cameron and his Titanic were was just way over the top and so grating. The ""twist"" was glaringly obvious almost as soon as the ship set sail - not sure how a detective novelist missed it quite frankly!The really innovative idea for this novel was, for me, let down by the characters and the J.C. (not THAT one!) love-fest."
5,I Loved It !!,"The whole plot of this book is great. I couldn't stop reading. I stayed up late so I could finish the book in one evening. That doesn't happen very often. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good mystery. You don't even have to be a fan of Titanic. But, if you are, you will love it even more."
5,A Great Tribute to A Great Film,"I thought 'Titanic 2012' was a wonderfully written tribute about a writer whose journey aboard the rebuilt Titanic is one of discovery, as well as of mystery and romance. The best part about it is that the writing is crisp and descriptive, and keeps one turning the pages, wanting to know what will happen next. And the author has obviously done his homework, as interesting details about the ship are skilfully woven throughout the narrative. Even if you haven't seen Cameron's film, you will enjoy this book. I recommend it--highly."
2,"Pretty Girls, Pretty cars.",Pretty girls intermixed with stylistic viewpoints of cars. Found it a little drawn out. Could use more girls and more emphasis on one or the other ... girls or the cars.
4,"Great High Energy, Raw Sexuality Music","This is the first album I bought released by Mr. Young. Although at times the women backing him up can seem screechy, it was the backup choice of that time. His voice is unequivocal. There is a great strength in his voice. The only reason I didn't give him 5 stars is because of the female backup. Come back and stay earned him great US recognition, Wherever I Lay My Hat is a greater cover than the original in my opinion. Broken Man is so very soulful. One truly believes he has been a broken man.My only reservation in recommending this cd, is the female backup on a couple songs. But there is a wonderful option of not playing those tracks and just loving the groove you find yourself in.Great stuff!!!"
5,Quite a Character!,"This is a great film for anyone interested in aviation, such as myself, or anyone interested in a fascinating slice of 20th century culture. I first heard of Pancho Barnes in the film ""The Right Stuff"" and was aware of her presence in early aviation, but I had no idea what an intriguing, outrageous and larger-than-life character she was. This is a very well-done and enjoyable film."
4,Great piece of aviation history,"This documentary is a wonderful piece of aviation history. Not enough of us were familiar with, or had even heard of Pancho Barnes. She was a rare woman who obviously loved life and lived it to the fullest. A must see for all aviation enthusiasts, and 20th century American history buffs."
4,Their best cd?,"There are some gems of songs on the other cd's they have, but I don't care for a lot of their faster punk songs, and some of them are basically crap. This cd I listen to start to finish without skipping over songs. White boys talking with a Jamaican accent in between songs is rather silly, but they make up for it with songs like ""Fireshot"", ""Sensi"" and ""Couldn't get High"". ""Wiseman"" is also a great song.Definitely worth the purchase."
3,Fun to listen to,This is a fun recording to listen to and the guys sound great. My only complaint is that I had heard this recording had come from a radio show appearance they did. There's no sign of that on this disk and very little talking between songs. For a live recording it would have been great to hear them talk more. They end up sounding more serious without that and just play their music.
4,Good Story! Good Characters!,"My only wish is that M.J. Pearson would replace that cheesy anD awful front cover with something more tasteful or erotic. It prevented me from purchasing the book for over a year!!The story inside is very good with a great plot and wonderful characters. Good background on the characters which helped to either love them or hate them.I felt there was a loose end when at the very end Jamie's grandfather was identified at a soiree and was told what he could do to help Jamie. This thread was not picked up and followed through, which would have been a logical conclusion to Jamie's life story.Lots of tension at the end.PLEASE! TO THE AUTHOR M.J.PEARSON - GET RID OF THAT BOOKCOVER!! It cheapens a very good story inside!"
4,Good product,"One of these is a must if you want to observe what is being dumped. Make sure you get the one with four lugs on the bottom and four grips at the top. I had one before with only two grips at the top. It broke during a dump. What a mess. The one with four grips is more rugged, as it needs to be. I would have give five stars but it took 10 days to arrive."
5,sounds good,"sounds good, looks nice. Im pleased. I just wish these center channels were not so expenisve to begin with. Overall feel good about the purchase."
4,Good match for NS-C series speakers.,"For the price, this is a great match for my large Yamaha 555 speakers. The mica domes match sound across the front stage, so dialog is blended seamlessly. I only wish there was a rear surround speaker available that is lighter than the 333. Also, the 444 is a rather large box compared to modern soundbars, so expect to make some room for it. The box looks like a large bookshelf speaker on its side."
4,Just the right level of challenge,"Bought this for my eight-year-old, who loves mysteries. These are succinct and not too arcane. If the mystery isn't solved immediately, several clues are provided. My child could solve most of the mysteries before we ran out of clues, making the game challenging but not frustrating. It is compact enough to be good entertainment for travel, restaurants, and similarly constrained spaces."
1,Wrong title,"Although this book is titled: ""Living as a Lesbian"" it really doesn't live up to its name. It is basically a collection of poetry by this author regarding all aspects of her life, not really reflecting a lesbian theme in most, unless there was something implied that wasn't clear. The poems didn't really speak to me. I felt as though a lot of them had background stories that were necessary to understand what was written, but, alas, since they weren't included a lot of the poems just fell flat or didn't stand out. I lost interest after about 6 poems. This book might be better titled: ""Everyday poems by a lesbian author."""
5,Great book,"This book was recommended by my shul as part of our class. I like and recommend it. Great for the beginner, but has something for everyone."
4,Excellent guide to Jewish prayer,"In my opinion, ""To pray as a Jew"" is not for everyone. It is written by an Orthodox rabbi, and it does not say things many modern-minded people would like to hear. That is why I think that those interested in learning (about) Jewish prayers should start with somewhat ""theoretical"" writings on the subject of prayer and ""mitsvot"" in general by Y. Leibowitz. Once they understand that a prayer with a fixed text at a fixed hour is the only serious way to pray, they they may move to R'Donin's book, which is an extremely helpful practical guide to synagogue and Jewish prayer, written in a very warm and welcoming manner."
4,An essential resource for anyone wanting to learn to pray.,"There are few books as easy to read as ""To Pray as a Jew."" You will find all the essentials ... from preparing to attend synagogue to what to do when you leave and thereafter. If you desire to learn how to make prayer an effective part of your everyday life, then you MUST read this book. It is a ""how to"", ""when to"", ""what to"", ""what else"" manual. You will certainly wear this book out!"
4,"Works Well, Fan is LOUD","I use this to power my 2 meter radio for amateur radio. It does the job, quite nicely and loudly. The fan is ridiously loud."
5,"Big Amps, Low Price","Have had several Pyramid* products which have all been great but for the price, this is amazing. Any other 20+ Amp power supply would cost well over $100. Have had one that has worked great at 10-20 Amp loads running the TEC coolers for my computer. Just bought another one recently because it is such an amazing deal and I could always you a backup, although I will probably never need it since my first one will probably last for more years to come.*It took me forever to find out who actually makes these and though they can be used for anything, found out that they are actually made for car audio systems. The company website is [...] ."
2,Like a gusting silk scarf it's full of metaphors.,"I had a real problem with this novel. The author tries way to hard to make everything a metaphor. Everything is ""xyz was like a blah blah blah."" It was very distracting from an otherwise boring book.This is a time travel to change history story. I'm sure everyone has read a dozen. I'd be happy to never read another.The main problem with this book isn't the plot, the silly metaphor's, or even the slow boring pacing; it's the fact that nothing really happens until the last two chapters. The rest of the book is, in my opinion, just filler to create a novel out of a short story.Here is my reccomendation, find a Peter David novel instead."
1,It's awful,Klingons attempting to change the past by destroying the Federation before it's born? It doesn't sound honorable.
4,put it on your desk,"A JUnit monster book! Detail after detail after detail... Such a amazing thing to see some many tips bounded together. But that's not all, rick background knowledge behind all those tips make it fit for all level readers. The only thing I would like to see more is about Mock from J. B, which definitely deserves at least one separate chapter. That's why I give 4 stars. Overall, this is really a master piece!"
3,Smaller than you think,"The description does not give you the size of this bag so I'll break it down for you. It is very narrow, maybe 2-3 inches front to back. Approximately 15 inches tall and maybe 12 inches wide. It basically has ""just"" enough room to drop my Dell Inspirion laptop into it without room for much else except maybe a 1 inch textbook or something. I showed it to my brother who thought it looked like a big purse...so for the price there is better out there, but all in all it isn't terrible."
