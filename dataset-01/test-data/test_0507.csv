3,They Could Do Better,"The Cd for me sounded the same... i gotta admit it was a good cd but im looking for uniqueness in the cd, and unfortunately i did not see it. The songs on there that shone were Ten Thousand Fists, Stricken, Overburdoned, and Avarice. the rest just sounded the same. This is probably Disturbed's weakest cd. They can do better"
3,could be better,"the new disturbed album left me thinking about what the hell is going on today in the music world. all of the great bands are starting to drop like flies. it was a decent album, the songs i did not like were made up with songs like ""ten thousand fists,"" ""guarded"" and ""stricken."" i also believe that excluding disturbed's cover of genesis's ""land of confusion"" disturbed doesn't sound right making political songs. disturbed is about bone crushing metal and raving lunatic lyrics. but most of all, disturbed is supposed to be about being disturbed in the head. disturbed ones don't dicuss wars, THEY START WARS! disturbed ones don't bitch about not liking a president, THEY TAKE ACTION! instead of doing nothing, they take the dude out of office themselves. i don't know, i just think disturbed sounds weird going ""can't you tell the war is far from over now"" and crap like that. if you have an opinion on this, i would like to hear it.[...] give me your opinion disturbed ones!"
5,Add another fist in the air,"Love Disturbed, and this one is already my favorite of theirs.10,000 Fists gave me chills the first time I heard it, it's a great opener to the album. There are actually a number of great songs that stick with you well after you've turned off the disc, something that's really missing from too many new releases. It's rare that a metal band can actually stay angry after becoming successful, but Ten Thousand Fists may well be more emotionally driven than Disturbed's first two releases.The only weak spot on the album is the cover of Land of Confusion, but I've never liked the original song; it's probable that your own mileage will vary with it.An angry, political, driven and inspired album that I haven't been able to put down for days."
5,It's fantastic!!!,The lobe wonder is an absolutely amazing product! It is worth every penny and if you have torn or even slightly enlarged earing holes. You will be amazed at how this product works. You will be able to wear earings again with no discomfort or unusual appearance! It's a life saver!
2,Not as great as I thought it'd be,"These little stickies don't lift the weight off heavy earrings that you would hope for; it's fine for light earrings where you don't need too much support, but fail to provide support for heavier earrings where support would actually be useful. I wouldn't recommend these because it's just a little piece of tape, but it might be useful if you have torn ears? I bought these as preventative care."
5,Surprisingly Moving!,"The first ""big kids"" toy I ever wanted was a GI Joe, and getting it may still be one of my fondest birthday memories. What is it about the endless adventure possible in our pal, Joe? Every aspect is explored in this documentary. Not only was the toy conceptually risky, but the lengths that its creators went through to bring it to us are as astounding as Joe's adventures, themselves. The unlikely subject of a toy line becomes a genuinely gripping, suspenseful, and honestly moving story about art, optimism, and the beauty of play. I found myself emotionally engaged on numerous levels as the story of this piece of Americana was shared. Fans of toys, nostalgia, business, and American culture will find much to love in this documentary. I wish we could award six stars instead of five!"
2,Not For New Knitters!,"This book is adorable and many of the patterns are also really cute. My issue with this book is that I thought the patterns were geared for beginners. I have knitted numerous scarves and about 10 hats (mostly on circular needles) but had trouble following the patterns in this book. Once you've really gotten the hang of knitting, I imagine that the book will be great...For what it's worth, I plan to hang on to the book until after I have gained more knitting experience. I just wanted to warn beginning knitters that you might want to consider starting with another book."
4,Knit Hats!,"_Knit Hats!_ is a very eye-catching book: it is bound between a sturdy hat-shaped cover. Inside, there are fifteen cute and fun projects. There is a lot of circular needle work included in this book, so it is helpful to have a good grasp on that before you start any of these designs. There are different designs that are geared towards beginners (a headband, and easy hat designs) and others that an intermediate or advanced knitter could settle in with. Everyone will appreciate the easy-to-understand instructions, and the full-length color illustrations.A fun and special addition to any knitting library."
4,Knit Hats!: 15 Cool Patterns to Keep You Warm (Knit),I really like this book and I bought a copy for a gift. I have found good basic reference information in it and some good basic knit hat patterns. I even learned new techniques from this book. I consider myself and advanced beginner when it comes to knitting so I still have much to learn.
3,2 lovely hats,"I liked this book, but I had to be careful the hats didn't end up too big around. Not all the hats were that great, but the few that were were worth buying the book."
3,Lengthy,"Interesting reading about this icon, but very long-winded. Could have been written with many less words. llIt will take a while to read."
3,"Not a bad game, but has defects","This game is essientially a Side scrolling, furturistic shooter. You command a robot in the future where a war is going on. The game takes you through several levels, having a steep difficulty curve. Weapons vary from your basic machine gun, to missles, to laser beams. all levels have damagable walls (what i mean by that is when you hit a wall, the part it hits turns into a slightly damaged piece). the game gets insanely difficult at the last level, and you dont get many lives or countinues. In short, this game isnt for people who dislike frantically dodging gunfire and facing huge bosses."
5,THE BEST OF PARTY ZONE,"this cd has such a great selection of music ,i would reccommend this for all .arrival before due date , price was perfect"
4,"Well, I expected the thermometer in the photo...","I expected a thermometer that went to -40F. I specifically bought this one because of that, since I'm going to be monitoring a freezer temp that might be below the normal -20F. The one I received only goes to -30F..... Anyway, my freezer isn't even below 0F, so I'm not going to return it. Still a bit annoyed, though."
3,"Works fine, but hard to put in place","I bought three of these. One for my refrigerator, one for the freezer and one for my big freezer that is outside. The thermometers work fine. They are very hard to put in. The included suction cups are hard to mount and they don't stick. If you get them to stick, they won't stay long. The metal hooks on the back work much better, but they still don't fit well. They would probably work fine hooked on a regular refrigerator rack. Mine has a piece over the front that prevents me from hanging it there. My only option is to use the door area, but I had to force it on, bending the metal brackets out a bit."
5,Excellent. Superb. Brilliant!,This book enhances the reader with techniques in which he or she can use to identify and refute relativistic statements.
5,And that's the truth,"If you've ever heard anyone say ""That's just your truth"" or ""Don't force your morality on me"" and you don't know how to respond, then this book is for you.It exposes the contradictions of a postmodern world and really lays out the dangers of being a relativist.Beckwith handles postmodern ""logic"" clearly and concisely and makes it easy to communicate the idea that there are absolute moral truths that exist, just as their are physical and scientific truths. This book is an essential tool for anyone who wants to make sense in a postmodern world.And for those who say that relativism works and Christians and others should just go away, ask if they believe that statement is true - by making this claim (that relativism is true and everyone else is wrong), not only are they making an absolute statement, they are trying to force this morality on others.In other words, even relativists can't live as relativists!"
3,Track listings are wrong...,"First of all this is not a xmas collection as AMAZON screwed up with the track listing. Without me listing all 48 tracks, you get a solid compilation of jazz greats mostly from yesteryear. There are many live cuts and most are remastered better than what we usually get from MADACY.Ofcourse in budget collections as this there will be omissions. Like! Where's Count Basie? Etc. The performances are good for the most part making for a subtle listening experience and some jazz aficionados will be pleased. There are no recording dates or personel credits provided.Overall this set is well suited for background listening when your wanting something else other than melody filled pop standards. And don't pay more than ten bucks for this!"
5,great!!!,"My husband and I have viewed about half of the dvd set. I missed the second season when it came on TV. It used to be that all new seasons started at the same time in the fall, but not any more, alas. So I bought the dvd set. The second season is just as good as the first. I really love this show. I like this kind of futuristic sci-fi and there's enough humor to weight off some of the heavier subject matter. It is a real winner!"
4,Came in good packing.,"It is everything i expected. The bigger, morew expensive remote was not as good. I have this one in the bedroom and now have the same one in the game room. Keep things the same. Less confusing."
1,Damaged Remote,"I purchased this item on Dec. 17th 2009, just before Christmas as a gift for my brother as he was getting a new home theater system for his new home. When he finally got everything hooked up in mid January, he realized that the remote LCD screen was black in one main spot and that it looked as it may had been used! When we contacted the online merchant to see if we could return the remote and get a replacement, we were told that this had to be done within the first 30 days of the purchase of the item... However, his gift was not opened until it was time to program the complete system and unfortunately it was 2 days past the 30 day time slot!!!! What a waste... No one would even respond to make an exception for the purchase!!!!Universal Remote Control MX-350 Osiris IR/RF Remote Control ( 8056 )"
1,Great value,"I have been using these Taylor Instant-Read thermometers for years in my deli. They are very durable and have lasted a long time. Since you have to be very careful in having food temps just right, these thermometers are easy to use as often as needed. Prices are great. They are worth more but cost less making them a great bargin. Made mistake in giving this item only one star, should have been 5. Sorry."
5,Works just like it should,It works! no worries with batteries... it was smaller than i expected it to be but all in all It does the trick
3,"Hard to read, very small face",I like the sheath/ handle that come with which allows you to hold it over a hot pan without having to hold the metal thermometer and safely store it in a drawer. the face is just a bit too small to read easily so it makes it less likely I will use it often.
2,thermometer,"Not water proof fogs up quick but, quite accurate readings needs some of the silicone sealant on it to last longer"
1,too short,I didn't realize from the picture that this thermometer is only about 5 inches long. This is way too short for measuring the internal temp of a compost pile. Most of these are 18 in long so I thought this one was too. It's pretty much useless.
1,Disappointing,"For the price I paid, I guess I shouldn't have expected too much, but I really can't even use his thermometer. Checking visually for doneness is about as reliable. It takes so long for the temperature to register that the food loses heat while you are checking its temperature, and if it is not done then it just has to cook longer because it takes over a minute for the needle to register 160 degrees."
3,Thermometer,Classic thermometer. It gives the temperature without all the fancy additions that I don't need. Good for cooking and baking.
3,Melts at 400 degrees,"These seem like decent little thermometers but are not oven safe contrary to the packaging. I bought two for cooking to replace an older thermometer that is unreadable now. I read the packaging when I first got them to verify they can be used in the oven and it said they were ""not safe for rotisseries or convection ovens due to high heat"". As I was making chicken in a regular oven I figured it should be OK, only to find out after 45 minutes or so at 400 degrees F the plastic on the front had melted.I am keeping the other one as it works well for checking the temperature, but don't buy one of these if you are looking for something safe up to regular oven temperatures."
3,Do NOT leave in oven!,"I've had this thermometer for a year and have loved it. I've used other thermometers for roasts and have left them inserted in the roast in the oven without any damage. With this thermometer, you must realize that the face is plastic and WILL MELT if it's left in the roast while it's baking. If you're using this thermometer, insert it each time you test its ""doneness"" to avoid ruining it!"
4,Tons of helpful advice if taken with a grain of salt,"This is an easy and enjoyable read; I find Lowndes' style engaging, entertaining and instructive at the same time. Some of the ""92 little tricks"" probably can make a real difference in someone's life. Some of the advice is a little repetitive, but most ideas are novel and readily applicable in various social situations. Some reviewers felt that Lowndes' style is too colloquial; I felt that her writing made it an easy and enjoyable read. What I especially like is the way the author summed up every tip in a little grey box so you can pick up the book at a later time and quickly reread what you're interested in. I can highly recommend this book, but I yet have to apply its tips in my life and see how valuable they are."
1,I'm disappointed,"I just got this - January 2012. In May of 2011 the USDA updated their guidelines for safely cooking pork. They recommend that pork be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit. Yet this thermometer still says 170 degrees for pork, which I cook a lot of.They certainly have had enough time to make that change on their thermometers. I wish I hadn't bought it."
1,Numbers wore off during 1st wash,"This thermometer is accurate, but numbers wore off too easily. During the first use it got covered with the gunk that meat thermometers normally do. I hand washed it and the numbers started to rub off. They are barely readable after only the first washing. They are not etched in, but merely printed on the metal and not sturdy enough to withstand scrubbing."
3,"Good, but fragile","I prefer to use thermometers without dials as they are more accurate. I was very pleased to get this thermometer a few days ago. I used it for the first time and it performed well. However, after I removed it from the meat I accidentially dropped it into my sink from about eight inches and the bulb that goes into the meat broke off. Five stars for accuracy, zero for durability. I will order another, but treat it as the fragile item that it is."
5,best type of roasting thermometer,"As a long time cook, I've found that leave in thermometers work best when trying to cook a beef roast to a rare state. It's important to see when the temperature is approaching what you want it to be so that it is not overdone. Today's nanny-state mentality and information tells you to cook everything to 140 degrees, but then it will be overdone. A good beef roast is too expensive to ruin by overcooking."
1,"Facile, Annoying and Self-Righteous","In this rambling stream-of-consciousness blurt, the author shares his opinions about foreign aid while linking them loosely with different settings he has found himself in. The conceit of writing this as dispatches frees the author of actually making, much less defending, arguments in a coherent way. Apparently, there are no real disagreements about aid, aid effectiveness or the best road to development. Everyone who disagrees with the author either doesn't have his field experience or has spurious motivations. Barely readable."
2,Not worth your time or money,"Thackrey's ""a radical practice' is an essay, not a book, and a thin essay at that. If you're like me, you buy anything with Oppen's name on it and sort it out later (this is not so dangerous as it sounds since there is next to no litrature on this astounding poet), but this essay will not assist you in understanding Oppen's poems or his relationship to Heidegger's philosophy. Thackrey's ""philisophical"" investigations consist of verbatum readings of Oppen's letters on the subject, which points you at least in the right direction. Put twelve bucks toward DuPlessis' ""selected letters"" and you will be very happy you did."
4,Celtic Christmas,"This two CD set is 83 minutes and 45 seconds long. All of the 29 songs, with the exception of four, are instrumental. I thought is was a nice Christmas album. I just don't think this is truly Celtic Christmas. It was something different for me."
3,Restoring CD 175 Honda,The book fails to provide enough detailed specifications of the different models within the book.
2,Silly,"Full of gimmicks and silliness. If you are into ""gimmick therapy"", you might like to call your eating disorder ""Ed"" and talk to ""him"" in an empty chair. Not helpful at all, although Ms. Schaefer seems sincere enough. Glad I checked it out of the library instead of buying it. I prefer to be talked to like an adult."
4,American Eskimo Dog: A comprehensive Guide to Owning and Caring,"This was a good overall dog book. Somethings were general about all dogs, some specific to just the eskimo dog. It was a good book to take you from puppyhood to a well behaved adult dog."
1,Taylor 1470 Digital Cooking Thermometer,"I bought two. Both were broken out of the package. One would at least register a tempature, but stop working as soon as you put the alarm on. One of the probe cords came out of the package in 10 pieces."
2,Some annoying features,"First, when you use the temperature probe, the meat temperature shows on the display. Also, it is very easy to set the temperature alarm. However, there is a small switch that must be turned on to activate the alarm. Good for one burned roast. Granted, a mistake you will only make once.Second, when the timer gets to zero, the alarm sounds, and the timer switches to an elapsed timer. A very nice feature. However, there is no way to shut off the alarm without stopping the timer. It will eventually shut off after one ear-splitting minute.Otherwise, it works."
1,New Model is Defective,"New Model has following problems.1. Times will not key in consecutively. If you press and hold down the key for your minutes, you will have to punch that key for EACH minute. Older models allow minutes to be entered with one press of the button.2. The probe did NOT work and would shoot up and down by ten to 15 degrees.3. Timer blinks and makes inappropriate noises???4. This is a MUCH POORER product than earlier models.5. AND OF COURSE IT IS MADE IN CHINA.6. Company rep was very helpful but when you have a small business and this product was crucial, it is wrecking my business.Probably won't buy again from this company."
1,Stopped working after 15 months,"It came with a 1 year warranty. The probe stopped measuring temperature three months after the warranty expired. Otherwise, it was an okay product. I thought the jack for the temp probe was a bit flimsy. But it worked well and was easy to read -- until it broke."
4,1st use went well,"Used the Taylor Digital Cooking Thermo today for the first time and found it EZ to figure out and reliable in roasting turkey breasts. The timer feature worked as I expected and the birds were properly cooked. To soon to see if the probe survives the oven heat, but I don't have high expectations. All else does what I need so it's a fair price for a good product."
2,Great Until It Stops working,"I picked one of these up last Thanksgiving for the turkey and it worked wonderfully. It responded so fast that it I was able to use it almost like I would an instant read. And, unlike the Polder probe thermometers, there is an on-off switch you can use on this unit.The bad news is that while it still works wonderfully as a probe thermometer, it is useless as a timer because it no longer can make any sounds. I use it solely as a back-up to my new Polder at this point, using it when I'm making two roasts at once or need to monitor two temperatures separately (such as white and dark meat of fowl).If you don't plan to use it too often or only need it for the big holiday meals, it's worth saving a few bucks and choosing the Taylor. However, if you have need of a high-quality probe thermometer for long-term use, go with a different brand."
3,Dissapointed,"I got mine about a month ago. It only reads 208 in boiling water. I can't justify sending it back because they're so cheap. It will work for me, but I'm disappointed with all the hype about how good they are."
1,Piece of JUNK,Right out of the box it displayed HI even in meat that my instant read thermometer read 46F. I am returning this piece of garbage. Do yourself a favor and buy something else. I would give it 0 stars if I could.
2,Great product loust temp prob,It worked great for about five or six times then it would max out the temp every time you plugged in the cable. after going on google and searching this problem I found out this quite common problem for this product and all you can do is replace the temp cable so if you are alright with that it works great.
2,Probe is fragile,Life of the probe is too short for the thermometer to be worthwhile. They should sell it with a few replacement probes or fix the problem.Sad situation because device worked well while it was alive.
1,Very disappointed,"I was so excited to get this because of the features. I bought it to use when I make crock pot yogurt and to get accurate temperature readings when cooking meat. This worked great the first time I used it. The second time it worked fine at first but then the readings went up by about 20 degrees F. Now, I turn it on in a 75 degree F room and it says its 164 degrees in here. I've tried removing the batteries, resetting it in the back and trying to find so me way to calibrate by putting it in ice water. Nothing helps. I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews before choosing this one. It's not worth the money. My $2 meat thermometer works better than this."
5,The Turkey was perfect,I used this digital thermometer to cook a 24 pound Turkey for Thanksgiving and it came out perfect to the last second. Very reliable. I've used other brands and they weren't as accurate or didn't last.
2,"probe keeps failing, no customer service contact info.","I keep buying these because they're the only ones I can find in my neighborhood, and I do wish to keep a constant eye on the temperature of food when it's in my oven. But the probes are prone to shorting out and have never failed to malfunction, sometimes after a year, sometimes after a few months. I can find no customer service contact information on the package or the 'manual' that comes with the product. If I could, I would contact the company to ask them to replace the probe. Since the probe goes out without warning, one can never be sure of the actual temperature of the food, and that pretty much renders this item worthless."
1,Stopped working after 4-5 uses,"My first digital thermometer. It was very useful and worked perfectly when I first got it. Then after about 4-5 uses, it just stopped working. I changed the battery a few times to no avail. I'll buy a different brand next time."
1,"Awful, calibration off by 25 deg after 1 use.","I used this thermometer once for beer brewing and it worked great. The probe is still in fine condition, but during a test today (I'm brewing tomorrow), the thermometer reads 98 deg in a 70 deg room. I stuck it in the fridge (about 39 deg), and it reads 67 deg. What a horrible product. Tried taking out batteries & replacing with new ones, hitting the reset button, changing to Celsius and back to Fahrenheit, nothing. It still reads about 25 deg off."
3,Used for Home brewing,"I use this for measuring mash temperatures in my mash tun. It's kind of cheaply built, but works ok. I water proofed the probe with a silicone aquarium air hose, a couple of O rings, and some keg lube (thanks Bobby M).It does work, it's just a little on the flimsy side, and I'm worried the one off switch will break at some point."
1,jfreel,"After nearly ruining a 20 lb turkey, we suspected our 1 year old probe thermometer was broken. Maybe the ""Lo"" indicator after 3 hours was our first clue. We put our other thermometer in and...Yowza...the breast was at a whopping 180 degrees! We were shooting for 161 degrees and 1 hour tented to 170 degrees.We immediately took it out and rested it, untented. Fortunately, because we had brined it, the breast turned out ok..not my best work. we had to gently rewarm in turkey stock to get it to the table warm.I am throwing away this entire unit...cant risk another $500 dinner."
1,Breaks after a few uses,"This Taylor thermometer would be nice, IF it worked. I like the big buttons, big numbers, and easy controls. However, there seems to be something faulty with its computer chip, because after just 4 or 5 uses all the numbers come up as ""888"" and it won't respond to any buttons. I tried replacing the batteries, ""power cycling"", holding down the reset button, and nothing will jar it out of the ""888"" mode. It is broken.I returned the first one (everyone gets a lemon sometimes) but the second one has the SAME exact problem. I believe it's simply not designed to last, and I will be choosing a different brand for my reorder."
2,Sorry I can't recommend,"Worked once just like I wanted it to, but the second time it only registed HI. I could get it to work for a second or two by moving the cord which leads me to believe the preoblem is with the probe and wire but a replacement cost the same as the complete unit."
2,It will break,I have had my taylor for about 18 months. It now reads 122 degrees without being in food. It is broken. Read some of the comments about other products like this and you will see that similar products are also unreliable. Keep your receipt.
1,Worthless meat thermometer,"I bought this item with high hopes and Amazon delivered it great with a fair price. I've had reasonably good luck with previous digital meat thermometers, but this Taylor model broke the first time I used it. It reads the meat temperature, but it's off by at least 70 degrees and doesn't track evenly, so you can't even use a temperature offset to measure the meat temperature. The timer part works fine, but that's about it. I ended up buying a Rosle digital thermometer and it works great. You can't leave it in the meat while it's in the oven, which was the desired appeal of the Taylor, but it is a well-made digital thermometer and I recommend it highly. Stay away from the Taylor."
1,Prob burns up,"I used this a few times and the prob wire started smoking and filled the oven with a toxic smell. I had to throw away 30 dollars of food and now I don't have a themometer. The last one of these lasted several years before it failed. Also, the timer does not work. So all in all this is now just an ornament and it is after the return window so I am out of luck. It lasted around nine months using it 3 times a month."
4,Melted my first thermometer in a turkey,"After destroying my first meat thermometer with my Thanksgiving turkey, I purchased this one for Christmas dinner. I use the timer quiet often and am pleased that I can hear it upstairs. It has a very long cord with the thermometer."
2,Fragile probe cable broken after several months,"When it works, it is good. But, the probe cable was broken after several months of light use. This was the second digital oven thermometer I bought, and both of them died the same way. No more cable-bound probes and no more of these thermometers. Stick to the dials that you stick in the food."
2,"Great, for 6 months......","I got this to replace a ""pyrex"" brand one that lasted about 10 years before finally succumbing to a fall. On the plus side, the screen is large and easy to read, the buttons are easy to use, and the beep at the end of the timer is loud and persistent. The problem? With gentle usage and no significant mishaps (i.e. I never dropped it into molten candy or the sink etc), the ""start / stop"" button has completely ceased to function. Great. So - lovely machine, but not if you want something that's actually useful for more than a year."
2,"1st Unit, I LOVED, 2nd and 3rd, not so much!","I am on my third unit for this digital thermometer. The first one I had, my kids lost the unit and I could not find it anywhere. I had the first one for well over a year with no problems.I bought another unit to replace the lost one. I noticed the cord on the probe was different. The first one was a metal wire, the second one had gray insulation around it. The 2nd unit bit the dust in about 2 months. I just bought my third, hoping the 2nd one was a fluke. Nope. The third one worked ONCE and that is it.I am tired of this brand and will be looking for another."
1,Died after a year,I loved this but I have to give it the poor review because it stopped working. It didn't get too hot or anything. Just started reading far hotter then correct temperature.
1,Temp probe broke first time out,"I've had this timer for a few months and finally tried the temperature probe function. It lasted all of 45 minutes and then when ""HI"" and after removing it from my roast it stayed there. Now it's a timer and a timer only. Very disappointed and wish I had seen these reviews before I purchased this item. I didnt buy it here.Don't buy this... EVER"
1,Terrible product,"Used only twice in one night (last night). Just put raw sausages in the pan and wanted to monitor temp but the led screen registered the meat at 199F! I then prepared to cook a flank steak, seared both sides and put in a 375 oven to finish with the probe inside and set the gadget to beef/rare. the first minute it seemed to register a real temp (105F) but a minute after all the screen read was HHH. Even now as I turn the gadget on the screen reads HHH and if you try to select a temp (say beef/rare/140F) the alarm goes off and there is no digital read, just the letters HHH. What a terrible product!"
3,Worked well; not very durable,"I used this product less than ten times in the year I had it. It worked pretty well. It had a timer and temperature function so it was pretty spiffy. The cord and temperature taker cleaned up pretty well.However, the thing stopped working about a year after purchasing it. When I set it on temperature mode, the thing's beeping alarm wouldn't turn off, even if the meat was still cold. I'm disappointed."
3,Fun To Play At First,"I recommend this for a one-time rental. It's fun to not even worry about trying to win and just go around shooting everyone. I think the game's only drawback is that it moves SO slow. Everyone in it looks like they've taken in vast amounts of tranquilizer, especially the hero."
2,program of stopwatch,"hallo, I just want to know about program of stopwatch.can you tell me about that, please."
3,"Just OK, Not Spectacular","The premise of Dragon Knights is good: three handsome and very different heroes are on a quest in a mythical land. We have a blond elf called Run, a redheaded human named Thatz, and a brunette half-demon named Rath. Each knight has a small, adorable dragon on his shoulder.My problems with this manga are that the art is light sketching without depth or shading, the story is confusing and hard to follow. The knights' eyes take up most of the panel space. The story leaps from nothing to action, which is a lot of swirling mist and you don't know who is who."
3,A FINAL FIGHT WANNABE 5.25 OUT OF 10,"Why during this time period did so many developers find it necessary to rip off Capcom franchises like Street Fighter and Final Fight? Cliffhanger is your basic Final Fight rip off. You punch waves of enemies and you pick up objects like knives. Overall, it does an embarassing job of trying to be the great Final Fight, so just play Final Fight because it's the real deal."
2,A disappointing read,"I read a favorable blurb in Newsweek about this book and therefore decided to read it. I myself have struggled with my career aspirations and with trying to mesh reality with my dream of what I thought adulthood would be like, so I had high hopes for this book. I found the first few chapters engaging and compelling and then I began to get . . . bored. The author teases you with the hope of upcoming revelations but then never gets around to making any sort of point. The whole book is rambling and disjointed and lacks any sort of a central theme. I also feel like the author contradicts herself by gladly embracing that which she earlier purports to reject (i.e., a glossy magazine lifestyle). Also (and I know this is a petty point, but I can't help it) her tendency to begin sentences with ""For"" (as a synonym for ""Because"") drove me absolutely CRAZY! It sounds so artificial and stilted! Overall, a disappointing read."
1,Natural hormone balance,Didn't find this book real interesting. I've read other books on this topic that was easier to understand.
2,End User,This Thermometer won't stay put in the pan! It moves all over the place if the recipe requires stirring! Other than that it works fine.
3,Not too accurate,"Initially thought it was way off, so I looked up how to calibrate (or if it was even possible) & found out that you need to have it in rapidly boiling water for 10 minutes. When I did this it registered 206 degrees (when I was hoping for 212). So, not super accurate....but hopefully we can accommodate for it. It seems sturdy and I like the clip for attaching it to the pot."
1,Great until all the numbers disappear!,I was very happy with this thermometer until to my dismay all the numbers started to wash off. Completely off! I washed it by hand every time. It is completely useless without numbers so now I'm in the market for a different brand.
1,Don't Buy - The numbers wear off,What good is a thermometer that you can't read? Its ridiculous to make a deep fry thermometer that cant stand up to the oil its measuring.
4,Neat little gismo,"This is quite a nice thermometer. It's extremely sensitive, so if you have very specific temperatures in your candy recipes, then it will work wonders. The only problem with it is it's awkward shape, which makes it difficult to clean and store. Otherwise, I would highly recommend it."
2,lost my numbers...,looking for a replacement. Too bad most of the dial-style thermometers fog or flood after washing. The worst part is not knowing when/how the numbers came off :(
1,A thermometer without #'s is No Good,"The numbers rub/washed off after two sessions. However, since I use it so rarely, it was too late to send back."
1,Horrible--numbers wear off!,"I really like the design of this thermometer, but it has a major fatal flaw: the numbers wear off! I bought it yesterday, used it once to make candy, and the numbers are now unreadable and smeared. I can even take my finger and rub off all the numbers and markings...how crazy is that??! It's a worthless piece of junk--back to the store it goes!"
1,Fatal Design Flaw,"I have begun making my own homemade yogurt and this was my thermometer of choice. Almost immediately, I noticed one major problem - the numbers on the scale began to disappear with only minimal cleaning pressure. I now own a useless thermometer. Save your money-buy anything else!"
5,Visual Emotions,"I use this bulletin board set for an after-school art expressions program.Children readily identify with the pictures. It helps normalize drawing and discussion of emotions. Sometimes the kids copy an image, and later personalize it. I think it's helpful for them to see examples, rather than lead in with a discussion about emotions."
4,Very good... but still needs 2 things.,"I am very pleased with this item, but there are 2 things that can improve this case.1) It's a lint magnet, so you have to clean it once in a while.2) It doesn't have a clear display cover, all thou the player's display is more protected, it still can be scrached, so be careful.Overall it is very good for the price, but if this could be included it could be far better.[...]"
3,Yet another Final Fight wannabe,"Great video games based on DC Comics are few and far between. Luckily, this one isn't so bad. It's basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up in the Superman universe. In addition to Superman, you also get to play as Super Cyborg, The Eradicator, Superboy, and Steel, depending on where you are in the game. Unfortunately, you can't play as Super Girl (surprise, surprise), a female version of Superman with a skirt and a valuable asset (no pun intended).+ Solid hard-hitting action- Can't play as Super Girl"
4,"Good value, more stable than a slip-on.","I ordered this after getting a similar product locally that ended up not being quite wide enough to wrap around the steering wheel completely. I put this on a 1985 Corvette with damaged leather on the steering wheel until I get around to restoring the interior. This is better than the one I purchased. Thinner, but denser, material. Looks pretty decent, feels good, and doesn't slip. Quicker to install than the ones that require actual stitching. Seems to be holding up well and it's easy to clean. I'd definately recommend this brand if this is the type of cover you're looking for.Only thing I didn't really like on it was the overzealous texturing. It's not convincing as leather."
4,$230.06? Are you nuts?,This is a good map of a very nice section of Maryland. Some of the roads that look like they might be significant on the map are often very minor (dirt) but I suppose that is the nature of this county which is quite rural.It is a good map to have if you plan on driving or exploring this area but don't pay $230.06. You can get it for $39.95 plus shipping from[...]I wish the seller would let us know why he/she thinks we should pay $230.06.
1,JBB is up sh*t creek,"JBB is not the same. They lost their bassist, their keyboardist, their sound man, some of the horns. Its not the same. The JBB of old was a roots reggae revival, of new a poppy excuse. If you want to hear some white guy doing roots reggae try Groundation."
2,Horrible !!!,"Wow! I liked their first two albums,but since,it has been a steady decline. Modern roots fans beware of this watered down UB40 (AT THEIR WORST) sounding album."
5,"A lot of ""old school"" fun.","Friends and I had played this game quite a while ago - it is a lot of fun, if you like ""old school"" tech. I received the game promptly and in condition that was posted. Very pleased."
3,Not so good outside the kitchen...,"I purchased this timer primarily for non-kitchen use, and so I was unpleasantly surprised to discover that the timer makes a buzzing noise as it winds down, which can be distracting when one is trying to time an activity which requires concentration.This probably won't be a disadvantage if you are only planning on using the timer for cooking (which is what it's marketed for) but if you need to time something free of background noise, consider another product."
2,Powerless,"The product did not work as promised. I wanted a natural product instead of the chemical laden normal drain openers and this had received excellent reviews. I purchased it and was excited to use it, but it didn't work as promised it did nothing, frustrated my husband went and bought a bottle of ZEP which of course opened the drain right up. I hope to find a natural alternative that really works, because this one didn't."
1,BAD BORING AWFUL BOOK,"I have never read such an awful, boring book in my life. Sitting through English class while reading this book made it diffacult to stay awake. I recommended it to an English teacher as a cruel joke. HA! HA! and she fell for it!!! if you have trouble falling asleep at night, pick up this book. It will make your eyelids very heavy."
2,wouldn't it be better to do something productive,"It seems that this book is simply negative. If you are so concerned about these ""insane crazy people"" then get away from them. Reading a book while imagining these people seems extremely obsessive and histrionic in itself."
2,Don't Bother,I found the book to be repetitive and boring. The information lacks clarity primarily due to tedious comparisons between the various character disorders and vampires.
5,Great book,I found this book to be very interesting and eye-opening. I was amazed to see some of the most difficult people in my life so perfectly described. I thought that the advice was helpful and the warnings about these folks well worth heeding.
4,Thoughts - Mardi,Very interesting book. Captures diverse personality traits without specifically diagnosing personality disorders. Easy and enjoyable to read. I think any person could identify with at least one of these personality descriptions.
2,Save your money!,"For a few dollars more, you can get a better quality cable. I bought this cable to use with my security camera DVR to hook up to my flat screen TV, I thought I would get a better quality picture over RCA's with my updated cameras, but I have faint rolling lines across the TV now and the picture quality got worse! I ordered a high resolution cable for a few dollars more that I'm going to try before going back to RCA's. If the new cable works good, maybe I just ordered the wrong cable for the job and it falls back to you get what you pay for!"
2,Dissapointment,"When I received this cord it was not goldplated as I thought it would be. And it WAS NOT 6ft, more like 3 1/2ft cord. >:("
5,amazing,"If you are on the smaller side this bra is great. It doesnt ""stick out"" like some padded bras. Stays close and conforms to your body. I highly recommend it. It has been hard to find though because it was being discontinued. Too bad!"
1,Blasphemy!,"I saw this CD in the store today, and was outraged. Apparently, I'm a bit out of date. ""Lilith Fair"" was bad enough, but to associate Christmas music with a demon? There are no words for how truly offensive to Christians this is."
1,What a dissappointment!,"After purchasing the same series book for Javascript 1.3, I was eager to breeze through this book as I had with the other. This book has no fluency and you will NOT know ASP in 24 hours. There are several different ways to complete tasks using ASP and the code given is the most confusing and difficult to follow imaginable. Learn from my mistake, stick with WROX."
2,Ok - but either the books or PWS on NT w/SP 3 is wrong,"This book was ok to get a feeling for asp, although for the life of me I could not get the source code in chapter 15 to work. I kept getting wierd errors the the objRS.cursorlocation = adUseClient on line 46. I guess either the code is wrong or PWS for NT workstation (sp3) cant hack it. Anyway being a SQL programmer I would rather write my own sql instead of using recordsets, as much as can be done at least. Except for that shortcoming, which i dont know who to attribute to the book is ok. Not a technique book though - pure nuts and bolts."
5,Another winner,"Once again, Fiona Buckley delivers a page turner. This, along with her other Elizabethan mysteries, is a rare treat, filled with historical details that seduce the reader into exciting hours of good reading."
4,MCAT Gold Standard Review,"This book contains a very clear and concise explanation of all the key concepts in science, complete with sample questions throughout the chapters. Material is presented logically, and no time is wasted with extraneous details, it get's right to the point. There are 3 sample exams as well, and each has a detailed answer key, which is of key significance in helping one learn from their mistakes."
5,The best ever!,Literally the best series I've read in a long time....the characters stay with you long after you are done reading. I loved this series. Please read - it will touch you too!
5,My favorite!!!!,"I love this series and am so excited to have it on my Kindle. Francine Rivers is an incredible author. The way the characters are developed make you fall in love with them. I read these books every couple years, and they are always exciting. I highly recommend this series to everyone!"
5,best series i have ever read,"this is, with out a doubt the best series i have ever read. ever person that i recomend it to also loves it. you can read it over and over again and it just get better."
5,Best series I've read so far,Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed these books. They are historically interesting and spiritually uplifting. All 3 have applicable solutions to living life as a Christian today. Each book is interesting and the character development is very good. I highly recommend these books!
4,Lots of FOUL play here!,"Rivers is a cut above what you normally see in so-called ""Christian fiction."" She creates interesting characters and vivid situations. But, is anybody else bothered by her overused description of all things nasty as ""foul?"" Is that the only word she's got? Maybe she needs a Thesaurus, or at least an editor who is awake. Also, I think her pagan characters are much more interesting than Hadassah, who is a bit of an abstract cipher for the uttering of the necessary pieties that make the book acceptable to its Christian audience."
5,an insight into 1st century Christians,This series was so great. Not only does it keep your attention in an entertaining way but it makes you think more about what it was like for 1st century Christians.
5,Incomparable Historical Fiction!,"Reader Beware.....You will never be the same after reading this this trilogy by my all time favorite author, Francine Rivers. She has surpassed all boundaries of Christian Romance in these three books. You like classic epics like Ben-hur? Or early Christian Romances like The Robe (film)? Then you'll love this treasure of these brave early Christians. The Romance. The Courage. You'll be on the edge of your seat before ""A Voice in the Wind"" is over. And each novel ends with you wanting to tear open the next. Words cannot describe the warmth in which I recommend these books, along with another favorite, ""Redeeming Love"". Readers will never forget the outstanding characters, the meaning of unconditonal love, or the value of faith put to the test. You cannot imagine the love the will fill you. I've even dreamt about the characters. You just cannot be the same without them."
5,Rivers at her best,"I read this series not long after it was published, and Francine Rivers' Mark of the Lion series is one of the best Christian trilogies published. Following Hadassah, Marcus, Atretes, Rizpah and all the other characters' lives is truly a journey well worth the time. The books are historically accurate and very informative while still being highly entertaining. This is Rivers at her best. Her other books are good as well; I especially recommend _Redeeming Love_ and _The Scarlet Thread_.I loaned my books to a friend at church, and from there, the series fanned out to at least nine people -- moms, daughters and even my father is now reading the series. These are books everyone can enjoy, learn and grow from."
5,Best series I've ever read!,"This is the second time I'm reading this series. The characters are so believable and realistic. I became so attached to many of them, especially Hadassah!"
3,Broke taking the battery strip out,My wife is petite. She is not a powerhouse in the arms. She tried to take out the battery strip and ripped the top of the unit off and broke one of the solder points. Pretty lame in my eyes.Luckly had a buddy with soldering iron.Otherwise we really like it. But would be a 50:50 on buying it again due to all that trouble. The battery strip thingy is way to tough to get out/off.
3,A bit Flimsy,"A good thermometer, but I found it a bit flimsy. It seems like the battery connection is not all that tight and it often just turns off when I am trying to take a temperature."
1,Not Even Worth the Cost ($10),"It worked great until the battery ran out. Once I replaced the battery, the temperature read only as ""LL.L degrees"" and wouldn't change no matter how hot or cold the thing I was measuring. The parts are barely held together - when I was swapping out one new battery for another to see if that was the problem, the temperature gauge mechanism came out of the metal needle with barely a tug. I had to toss it out after only using it about 8 times. If you cook meat regularly, invest in a better quality thermometer."
2,I haven't used it yet but...,"I've never used it myself (my coworkers have), so I can't say much about the functional side. I can say it's very cheaply made. I dropped it once and the top came off and exposed wires and batteries. Also the thermometer itself falls out of the case."
4,"Good Product, Great Service",I received this product in brand new condition as it was stated on the website. I received the delivery quickly and it was packed to prevent damage. I would work with this seller in the future.
3,Not quite so fast,I had read that this was a fast reading thermometer. Well it just isnt't. It can up to a minute to read.
5,Great Product,This thermometer is a great unit. I have used many thermometers over the course of my cooking career and this is by far one of the best ones I have used. I take food safety extremely serious so I need a product that gives me accurate results and this product delivers.
5,Use it every day,"Everyone should use one of these to watch the 'doneness' of meats and fish, to make sure that things are hot enough to be safe and cool enough to be on the table.I love this thing and would not be without it."
1,Cheap and shoddy,"Cheap - switch failed (that is, it broke completely off!) after less than a year of occasional use. Replaced it with another Taylor thermometer, which had its own problems. Will never buy a Taylor thermometer again."
2,Only lasted one month.,"I've had a couple of these digital thermometers, and somehow they don't seem to last very long. This one died after only about one month."
2,Broke after only a few uses,"This worked very well for a few uses; however, the on/off switch was always very hard to move, as though it was jammed or something. Eventually the switch just broke off. Now it can't be turned on and is essentially unusable. This might just have been bad luck; still, I will definitely go for a more durable model next time."
4,"A few things missing, but still good.","Short and to the point, this novel depicts the return of Jean Grey and the creation of X-Factor by the original X-Men. It is a very well done story, but it was definitely missing a few cogs. It should have included X-Men #201, which depicts why Cyclops left the X-men. A few segments from Defenders #152, which show why Angel, Beast, and Iceman were ready to retire would have been a huge plus. (Not the entire issue, however, as most of the comic was not that good.) Still, a nice job."
4,rob30328,Great for third and fourth grade science experiment especially when teaching life science segment with growth and reaction. Also mad an excellent class pet.
4,More Metal than the second and third album,"It's the fourth Cruachan's album and I think it would be helpfull if I compare it with their albums came before.The first Cruachan album, Tuatha na Gael, is a extreme Metal masterpeace. It's perfect and beautiful as Cruachan will never make better.When Karen Gilligan came with her pretty female vocals, Cruachan made two albums with low Metalness, The Middle Kingdom and Folk-Lore.Pagan isn't so good as Tuatha na Gael, but it has a higher Metalness than the second and third album. Karen's vocals became better and more interesting, and the presence of Keith Fay O'Fathaigh harsh vocals are stronger than before."
3,Sexual!..,"Liked the story plot, could have been better if some things where left out that didnt make any difference in the story."
4,Good Tool for Difficult Job,We bought two of these to make this incredibly messy job go faster. The bag is a great idea and the clasps which hold the bag on work great. The bag catches a lot of hte debris and makes cleanup a 'little' more bearable. However; the bag gets really heavy quickly and can cause you to gouge the ceiling. The corners of the scraper are REALLY sharp and will also cause a lot of damage to your ceiling. Thankfully I read this in a previous review of this item and it was recommended that we round the corners of the scraper before damaging the ceiling. We did this and it worked great!
1,Poorly designed tool,This tool is sub par... It is poorly designed and does not have enough strength in the attachment to work well. The area that attaches the scraper to the handle bends as it is too weak to support the necessary pressure to scrape wet popcorn ceiling..Consequently you have to re bend the tool after about three scrapes. I highly recommend a much less expensive wide blade putty knife and a vacuum cleaner over this worthless device!
1,Worthless,"Worthless. Angle is all wrong. Just does not do what it is designed to do.A spray bottle with water and a 4"" scraper works much better."
3,nice,it's nice but it's an irregular fit. if you are buying this for a tall person 6 feet it might look young at the sleeves
4,The Actions of a 12 year old,"This book is a really good book for someone that is about to turn 12. It really does tell you how Katie lives her life and everyday she does. To her ts kind of like a symbol. But, luckly, she doesn't care what other people do or think about her. Thats what I like about her. Thats the most coolest thing about her. Her journel is like her diary."
3,Needs improvement,I've been using this product for a couple of weeks. I haven't seen any changes on my skin tone yet. Though I'm not allergic to the product I found it smell quite unpleasant. Very acid-y.
4,Very nice,I love this set set except the fact that sugar pot's lid does not have a sure grip.It slips out of my hands.Otherwise it's great.
2,too lengthy for my baby,"This DVD is well done and nice to watch, but the massage technique is just too long and involved for they typical baby in my opinion. I bought it when my baby was just a few weeks old and she couldn't tolerate a 40 minute massage, nor do I have the time to give her a 40 minute massage every day. I was also a little but put off by all the oil they used on the babies in this DVD. Now my baby is three months and I just purchased Aimee's Babies Baby Massage DVDAimee's Babies Developmental DVD with Baby Massageand I really like it. The massage is exactly what I was looking for, very practical and simple. Aimee's Babies also includes baby stretches and other tips for reaching milestones that are really relevant to my three month old. I wish I had it when she was a newborn because it talks a lot about vision too. I got it on the Aimee's Babies site and it is a little cheeper. The Gaiam DVD is nice, but not at all practical."
1,Christmas in the South,"I am sorry to report that Christmas in the South did not live up to my expectations. I was looking forward to some cozy Christmas stories but unfortunately, most of the stories left me wondering what the point or message was. Perhaps if read in a classroom or discussion setting, more could be gained from reading this collection, but for the reader looking for some feel-good, cozy Christmas stories, this might not be the book for you."
4,Return of the Wolfman,"What a fabulous book! It's a shame that it's out of print (I own two copies)as any fan of the Universal Monster Movies will enjoy this tremendously.It begins at the climax of the movie ""Abbott & Costello meet Frankenstein"" (a favorite of mine)but does not dwell on A&C. Explanations of the so-called ""demise"" of the Wolfman and Dracula are given as well as why there is an old castle on an ""island"" off Florida's coast. Although the story centers on the Wolfman, a great deal of coverage is given to Dracula, with Dr. Morney (Sandra) and the Monster given ample coverage. It is also a shame that Ken Jacobs took over what had been a great start to a promising series. He went off in a different direction and lost the atmosphere of the would-be series. Hopefully Mr. Rovin will return to the subject matter and use other characters in Universal's menagerie as well as he did with the BIG THREE (Frankenstein, Dracula & the Wolfman)."
2,Cheap Rehash of Frank Miller glory,"I'm sorry but all the smoke that gets blown up Kevin Smith's... for this book is unjustified. First, the only reason I gave the book 2 stars is because of the great art(coloring included). I bought this book on a recomendation from a friend and was close to being offended. Having read and loved the Frank Miller DD run it seemed to me it had been done before. Gee, Bullseye killing DD's love interest, where have I seen that before? I don't mean to be rude, but that is just one (of many) instance of similarities. Also, didn't I read recently that Kevin Smith wanted to have a challenge? Why doesn't he try to make up his own characters instead of ripping off people that worked hard for their name in this industry. Try going to work for ABC(America's Best Comics) for a change with your own characters. Maybe THAT would be a challenge?"
4,A great book for an excellent character,"A few years ago Daredevil was in the pits. No one cared since Frank Miller left and he was at the bottom of the top 100 list. This storyline changed everything. Brought together with a magnificent and compelling story by Kevin Simth, action packed and sexy art(Black Widow, va va voom) by Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti, and vibrant colors by Avalon Studios made this book the gem that it is. This storyline is a savior to fans everywhere. And you won't need Mephisto to tell you that."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Not bad, but not as good as people say, I think, this tragedy of Mysterio. A loser supervillain builds up an elaborate revenge and other fantasy around Daredevil. This is in large part due to the fact that is dying of cancer. As a consequence, Daredevil has a lot of problems, and loses a long time lover to AIDS, as she was an ex-junkie."
2,Does not work on VISTA!,"This game would have a better review, but it doesn't work for Vista. I'd have even forgiven that, but the reason it doesn't work is ONLY it's copy protection! Yes, you paid good money for it and the people who ripped it off for free from the Internet have no problems at all.The game itself is OK, nothing spectacular. It is quite difficult, but not impossible. You spend most of the time as Wolverine, thankfully little time as Iceman (awful). Nightcrawler is a real treat, he's done better here than any X-men game I've ever played. If you have XP and can find this for maybe $15 it's probably worth it. I got this for like $7 and it was worth that."
5,Complete Wildflower Reference,"I am very pleased with how thorough and complete this book is. It is very comprehensive and user-friendly. You do not have to be fluent in botanical terms to identify an unknown flower.I also agree with the other reviewers that there should also be an index (or at least a cross-reference) of common names. Having to deal with only latin names does create an obstacle.That being said, this is THE best field guide I've experienced with Pacific NW Wildflowers."
5,Lovely book,"We bought this for our daughter who lives in Seattle. She walks often out in the wild, camera in hand, and many things in the west are different from here in Michigan. When she got this last Friday, she was thrilled. Photos are lovely and information is very helpful."
2,Monopoly Review,"The board filling the entire screen and spinning tended to give one vertigo. But when you minimized the board and stopped the spinning, it was almost impossible to see the player pieces and who was where.Having to insert the CD every time you wanted to play was not acceptable. I travel a lot and have no intention of taking a CD with me so I can play a board game I loaded on my PC.The second time I tried to play at home, my PC would not recognize any data on the CD. It was as if the information had been erased but the CD had just been lying on the table for a few days.I would not recommend this version of Monopoly to anyone."
5,All the info you'll need,I picked up the Disney World Passporter at a book fair and was so excited to see they have one for the cruise line too. This guide is packed with more information than you could possibly need with honest reviews and detailed information for the on-board activities and shore excursions. This spiral-bound version is nice because you can remove the pages you don't need and tuck things into the pockets. Highly recommended!
1,I hope CAPCOM sued them for this.,"I always wondered why they never continued to make Double Dragon games once the Nintendo 64 and Playstation era came around. The SNES version of DD4 was OK but nothing compared to the NES or arcade versions, then this atrocity made its why onto my computer.It is a cheap rip-off/clone of Street Fighter II. None of the charactors you can choose are even slightly familuer, the moves arnt that easy to pull off and it ends up a boring button masher.No wonder Double Dragon never continued after they buried it with this garbage. This games even worse then watching the DD movie!!!!"
3,Better book than the first one in the series,"I don't have a lot ot say on this book other than I liked it more than I did the first book of the series (Tempting The Beast). The heorine for this story was a better character. She was actually a strong female vs. Merinus from the last bok who was just a brat with a potty mouth. (In fact I found myself wishing Merinus out of every scene she was in for this book, that's how much I disliked her in the last book.)I think that this is a series that will build with each book getting better and better with more detail as we go along the way as the ideas develop.Not the best world building series I have read, but there is a lot of potential here for this to be a great series in later books. I am looking forward to catching up and reading them all."
1,it's all about sex,I've got an headache while I read this book... to be honest... this book was very disappointed... too much expectation...
1,Absolute garbage!,"The heroine was vicious and nasty. The hero might have been a nice guy but kept reacting to her accusations and venom in the same way that anyone might. Repetitive sex on every page between people who seem to hate each other all because they are FILLED WITH MATING HEAT. I myself prefer to LIKE my sex partner, both in and out of bed. I couldn't even finish this book and deposited into garbage can without further ado. Wish I had my $12 back."
4,"If you liked the first book, you'll love this too.","This book is every bit as good as the first with the added bonus of a little more romance!A lot of the complaints about the first was that there was more sex than anything else. This book gives you more of a chance to learn about the main characters history together. Yes, they actually have a history and relationship before the sex starts. You can actually believe that they love each other and it just isn't about the heat.For those that love these books because of the hot sex, naughty language, and alpha males, be assured that those traits continue!The only reason I haven't given these books five stars is because I think the author needs to give a little more information on the breeds, labs, etc. I have hope though because it seems as if this book was a little more detailed then the last. Another thing that I can not get past is the cover - it does not do it for me!"
2,not accurate but humerous,"well, i asked my vietnamese friends their opinions...they said the language was not accurate. but the choice of terms was humerous."
3,Not pin point perfect - but pretty darn good,"I own a small paperie so needed a heavy duty cutter. This isn't pin-point perfect and you need to adjust your alignment for buckling/shifting. That said, it's pretty darn close to perfect and saves me a TON of time.There was a little bit of rust on the measuring stick so I contacted the seller who sent me replacement the next day. Great customer service."
1,Not real Delta parts from Wholesale Plumbing,"Don't be fooled by the picture, what they are selling is not a genuine Delta part. The one I received didn't even fit in the faucet. Waste of time and money."
5,What a album of wonderful music!,"I first heard about this album when I attended one of Jim Brickman's concert in Singapore. At first, I was reluctant to spend money on another of Jim Brickman's albums ( I had 4 of them already). But when I heard that song, "" My Heart Belongs To You"" , I knew I had to get this album.It turned out that this album is a wonderful collection of songs. I loved all the songs in this album.....especially Your Love by Michelle Wright and "" We Live For Love"" by Stephen Bishop.Cheers to Jim Brickman for another wonderful album. And I will be looking forward to his next album, Destiny, coming out next year (1998)."
4,Not so traditional wedding music!,"After finding the couple who has been married the longest at the wedding reception and hearing their words of wisdom to the bride and groom, The DJ will play After All These Years. The lyrics are perfect. I look forward to dancing to this song on MY 25th anniversary."
1,Horrbile ASP reference!,"This is the worst technical book I've purchased, and I have a few. I was enticed by a code sample mentioned on the web, and even that is garbledygook. Horrible index. This is not a reference, not for real programming."
2,Vague at best !!,"I think the Authors are trying to cram to many engine types into 1 book. The majority of the info simply refers you back and forth to different sections. None of which help you much when it comes to actual troubleshooting.The book doesn't take into consideration the various parameters you might encounter as a vehicle ages,or even list possible causes if a component is outside the listed values. A Haynes book costs about a third as much and is just as informative."
4,The dragon info,hey peeps yo this game is off the hiz hook u should get itit is the one game u will be proud to have
2,DBZreview,It was okay but wherever u went you'd be attacked and if you aren't at a good level you would die. You'r attacks like spirit bomb is cool but they don't get you very far so this game is a piece of junk!!!!!!
3,Huge!,"FYI, these things are huge! I ordered my regular size and they are at least an inch too long. They also are very wide."
4,Good quality socks,"I ordered these socks in purple for my son who plays pee wee football. The quality was very good, and the purple matched his minnesota vikings uniform great!"
2,time consuming,"I returned the item as it took too long to calculate the foods that I ate away from home into grams and most of the time I wouldn't know how many grams the food was. I put half of an avocado on the sccale and it didn't give a readout. I had to put the whole avocado on the scale to get it to weigh, although I was only using half of an avocado. I'm going back to looking everything up in a book and save a lot of time."
4,A must have...,"This is one of two scales I own. I keep this scale at work, and it's extremely convienet, as it doesn't take up much desk space. It's great for those that work, and must purchase food at or near work (i.e., not bring food in), as it allows one to weigh any type of food. It has a library of about 1,100 foods, and will give nutritional breakdown of all foods in library. Also, if the food you weigh is not in the database, at the very least, one can weigh the food, and then obtain the food's nutritional info online. It also allows one to store their food intake day to day."
2,Mic OK but picture quality lacks,"Liked the built in microphone. The zoom and pan features are nice.Unfortunately the video and still picture quality is poor. Probably will toss when another ""good"" deal comes along."
4,Its good,"Its good with its result and quality is fine, Easy to install and use.The only problem is , its hard to attach it on the laptop , because of it usually fell because of the loose grip."
2,Works okay.,Not totally impressed with how the cam works. A little slow and choppy and had to reinstall.
3,Good tips,"Being a beginner knitter, I rather like this book than the Knit Hats book. Although the 2 books have color knitting, this one on mittens gives out several tips on how to continue with the color patterns when increases are made for the mittens and the explanation can be easily understood. Just wish they teach how to continue the color patterns if there are decreases."
2,Too delicate!,"These glasses are not packaged very well by the manufacturer. So the larger the Bodum glass, the greater the chance it will arrive broken. They're made of very thin, weak glass. It's like drinking out of a Christmas tree ornament. I'm afraid to even drop ice in them, let alone toast a friend. Also, they do not stack."
5,Truly a knitter's book,"This is at its core a character study set in Australia of two very different women, both widows, who forge a rocky friendship while laboring over a project involving both of their preferred crafts. One woman is a teacher and writer and the other is a prolific knitter. It is a quiet story with loads of (not gratuitous) knitting references. I really wanted to see and touch the handmade pieces in the story. ""Knitting"" has a very satisfying ending."
4,"lacked a song, but good","""The bold mounseer"" was missing, but the disk was otherwise great. The performances were very good, indeed. As was the disk quality"
1,Awful!!!,This is an awful G and S production. The whole British series is a disaster but this is about the worst. Even Price can't save it. And why did they leave out some of the best music? The best G and S on DVD remains the Australian Opera's PATIENCE and the Canadian Stratford's MIKADO.
1,Worked for 2 months...,"...then died (hangs on writing the lead-out).Technical service was pretty terrible - they basically told me that they don't support Nero (with which it worked fine for 2 months) and had me waste time installing their own bundled software and firmware updates, which of course did not help."
4,An inconsistent series (the stars are for The Mikado only!),"Refer to the previous reviews that actually review instead of talking about their feelings, and my opinions are similar. I disagree, however, with the estimation of the main reviewer. The Opera World version of The Mikado is one of the picks of that series. Not only do we have excellent casting in most of the named parts (except for William Conrad who manages to only barely hold on to the tune!). Every time I watch, I catch another little nuance in facial expressions (watch Peep Bo). And the glorious voices of Nanki-Poo and Yum Yum! If I could find any thing else with Mr. Stewart's voice I'd snap it up in a heartbeat."
1,Badly Distorted Sound,I screened the VHS tapes a few years ago.I trashed the entire set because the sound recording was badly distorted. Apperently the transfer to USA format was made at too high a sound level resulting in completely unacceptable distortion. I don't know if the DVDs are any better. I hope another reviewer who has screened the DVD version will address this issue.
3,The Best,"My wife and I watched them all when they dirst appeared on television, and I have only one short phrase to say in criticism - THE BEST!"
5,ESSENTAIL CAPTAIN AMERICA,THIS IS KIRBY AND LEE AT THIER BEST.THE EARLY DAYS OF MARVEL WHEN EVERYTHING THEY CREATED WAS FANTASTIC.FROM THE SLEEPERS TO THE SUPER ADAPTOID WHICH ARE SOME OF MY FAVORITE CHILDHOOD STORIES.AND THERES ALSO LOTS OF THE RED SKULL.THE DEFINITIVE CAPTAIN AMERICA VILLIAN.
4,Definitely got a bargain,"First, buy it one size larger than you normally wear. Made a little on the small size. Overall, great bargain. Well sewn, good lines, but the pockets are a little small so don't expect to stuff fluffy gloves in them. 4 stars is appropriate at the sale price, wouldn't have been quite so generous at full price."
3,"Informative, but too technical","I bought this because of good reviews on the book, but I find it hard to follow because English is not my first language. I'm having difficulty to get the author's meaning. Apart from that, this is a good book and very informative, but too technical on psychological perspective."
5,An Excellent Resource for Any Parent or Caregiver,Dr. Holinger has written a book that gives me a new way to view my child's actions. He gives me the ability to understand and react to my son in ways that keep him safe but allow him to explore this wonderful world he has entered into. The book is fun and interesting to read (even with all my highlighting!) and the vignettes make his points even easier to understand. This is a must have book.
3,Too Much For Too Few!,"While this book is funny/interesting, there was nothing in this book that I had not heard before or that experience or common sense (remember what that is?) had not taught me. I believe that the the book is also vastly over priced for it's size(120 pages). Save your money, buy gas for your bike, and use the best teacher of all, get on the road, and in the wind."
4,Cute Book - A Fast Read,"This book is very easy to read--takes only a little while. It provided many chuckles, smiles, and nods acknowledging the truth in some of the quotes.I'm recommending it to everyone in my HOG (Harley Owners Group) chapter."
3,not listened to it completely yet,I cannot give a proper review because I never finished listening to it. I got bored with it and never listened again. I guess I didn't really get it.
4,Good Flamingo,I like this stuffed flamingo. It is pretty decent quality and did not disappoint when I received it. I would recommend this to anyone who likes flamingos.
3,its smelly.,"it fits well and not hard to install. But, after i drove, my hands smells like rubber from the cover. I like the grib, just wish that it doesn't smell so bad."
3,moquito net review,"Texsport Hiker's mosquito netting is a good netting as far as I am concerned. I used it during a night out in Virginia and laid it just over my head and my pack, it worked great, I have already reccomended this product to my friends."
1,MY ONLY ROTTEN AMAZON DELIVERY: SHUN THE VENDOR,The product is great! I love these 200 watt GE bulbsfor the wide range superior light in my front hall lamp.THE VENDOR WAS JUST AWFUL!!!! DAMAGED GOODS!!!2 CRACKED BULBS OUT OF 12 IS UNACCEPTABLE!!!!I didn't bother contacting this inferior packer.That would increadse the losss..w/further waste of effort & time.I did write a review about that grossly inferior serviceand expected no follow*up nd got none...of course.THIS WAS MY ONLY AMAZON ROTTEN EXPERIENCE/ Fingers crossed!
2,"Nice, but image is not great","Great design, it is definitely very compact. Installation was simple however the image on mine ""jumps"" every few seconds. This is very annoying to the other person. I contacted Creative support and they were not very helpful. Unfortunately, this one is going back...."
5,I like it a lot,"I really like this camera because it's compact and saves me a lot of space compared to my old one. It's clear and none of what the previous person's ""jumping"" happened to me so maybe it depends."
3,Windows Vista,This camera is not compatable with Windows Vista as stated in the description.If you go to creative Labs web site they will confirm this. You can't use the software that comes with it.You have to download a newer version from there web site.Plus you have to download the driver which is a Beta version and it still might not work.I know i have one and tried using it on my laptop.I finnally got it to work but software was slow in responding. They do have a newer version of this camera just for Vista. That's why there selling cheap Normally they sold around $79.99 in retail outlets
1,worste camera I ever owned,"I too have had this camera for 3 years exactly and have the same problem it suddely went black. I would do all the functions but the picture would turn out black no matter what I did. I called a couple of places and they told me to replace the battery and reset the camera and neither worked for me either. I am very dissatisfied with this camera and Sony. I am now forced to buy a new camera because of the rediculious cost to fix my camera. I am going with the Nikon I have not heard any bad issues with these cameras. I own a 35mm and love it. It takes excellent pictures, but I require a digital because of the kids and it may take 10 tries to get a good one. Anyway I will never buy sony agian!!!!!"
3,Good Overview,"This book gives a good overview of all aspects of in-hand showing, from feed and nutrition through presentation. However, it is a little weak in the area of training (i.e., how to teach your young horse to stand correctly or to trot in hand). If you are looking for alot of detail in that area, keep looking. The discussions regarding conformation/movement criteria for the breeds covered in the last portion of the book is excellent if you are showing one of those breeds (those most commonly found in England)!"
5,Hard to read and stay focused,"purchased for a class and it changed the way i analyzed things, . . . . . . . . ."
1,Overpriced,"Forty dollars for a 50-page book? That's about 80 cents per page. Not sure if this is worth it. Besides, how much information can you cram into a 50-page book? And this book supposedly has color plates? Where would you fit them?"
1,This is NOT belly dance music,"This is cheesy funk music, redolent of clapper lightswitches and huge sideburns. Were the artists trying to mislead the middle eastern dancers out there?"
3,NOT TO GOOD,"I'M A KORN LOVER, BUT THIS DVD DOES NOT SHOW WHAT I WAS EXPECTING, IF YOU ARE A REAL KORN FAN YOU MUST HAVE IT NOW, BUT YOU'LL NOTE THAT ISN'T AS GOOD AS ""LIVE"" IS, WHAT I LIKE THE MOST WAS THE PEOPLE WHO WORK BEHIND THE BAND, SO BUY IT IN CASE YOU ARE A KORN FAN, IF YOU DON`T KEEP YOUR MONEY SAFE!"
2,Horrible Taste!,"Wilton fondant is easy to roll out, but the taste is disgusting! At first it seems okay, but the after taste will ruin any cake you serve. I highly recommend making your own fondant using Wilton glucose and glycerin. The following link contains a recipe and directions: [...]."
5,inside the whirlwind,"Little Eva evokes in us childhood memories of things we don't fully comprehend, but experience at a gut level. We're inside the whirlwind with her getting through each day, trying to live in the child's world, which is constantly being interrupted by the adult world and adult goings on. We see through her eyes, almost as pure experience, without judgment or rancor. Ms. Leveton recounts the Berlin of her childhood with a humanity and a love that overcomes our suspicion of the Germans. These are people who are trying to find their way in a world beyond their control, much as we are. Eva takes us where few of us have stepped, and I feel very enriched by having had the opportunity to share this journey with her.Mike Spring"
3,"Just ""ok"" for me :(","This video isnt terrible and I read the mixed reviews before I decided to purchase. With that said, I was not interested in an upbeat video as I wanted a sculpting workout. I have cardio. But the instructor's (forgot her name) form was not the best and she did not communicate clearly enough for me like whether to use light, medium or heavy weight. I liked about 70% of the video, hence the 3 stars."
2,This isn't the Bulova I know,"I purchased this watch about six months ago, after my old Bulova's (7+ years old)band broke. Instead of sending the broken watch out to see if they could repair the band, I bought a new one. This one is beautiful, and I have worn it almost every day since I bought it. The downfall is that the ""stainless steel"" is actually plating; the steel rubbed off and exposed brassy looking metal underneath, and the clasp won't stay shut-I've actually had to resort to taping it shut.This watch is less than a year old, and it's falling apart. My old Bulova was a Caravelle, (the lower grade), and it upstood my harsh job at a grocery store; this one can't handle my job as a teacher and a student.My conclusion is that I'm upset I didn't buy another copy of my ""old"" watch; and I've had cheap-o Walmart watches last longer while looking better."
1,The most insipid book ever?,Ms. Davis' book represents a new low for publishing--the insipid chronicle of a woman who could get vertigo in a sewer. Let's hope this Carnie Wilson-look-a-like's TV scripts aren't as inane as this.
5,"If they won't let you play it, throw them out!","I once, long, long ago, and very far away, had my in-laws over for x-mas morning while my young-er son opened his gifts, and they objected to it being played. I told them they could leave if they didn't want to listen to the best x-mas album I'd ever heard, and I've heard a million of them, (my dad used to start listening to the stacks of his as soon as Halloween was over). They did. I turned up the volume. 'Nuff sed."
3,A version of PHOENIX,"This is a game by IMAGIC that made Imagic a lot of money and it resembles a version of the arcade game PHOENIX (Which Atari got the license for). It has some mild differences and graphics, but is basically the same thing. Shoot these giant birds out of the sky. I was not really that impressed with the game and I really enjoyed playing the licensed game by Atari PHOENIXPhoenix (Atari 2600). If you are a collector I might recommend it. And Imagic has better graphics then Atari has...which is funny since the guys from Imagic worked at Atari...come to think of it, so did the guys from Activision.-Thanks"
4,DON'T LISTEN TO THE CRITICS,"This movie plays like a long Saturday Night Live skit more than anything else, which is why people complain so much about the script, but it's pretty good actually, it made me laugh plenty of times. You have to remember it's a wry John Candy movie, not Lethal Weapon 4 or something. Plus Meg Ryan is in the movie-- which is always a plus."
3,Funny movie,"I loved John Candy and will never forget this movie. I laughed hysterically at the scene with Eugene Levy taking on the mob at the union meeting and both of them guarding the dump and the guy comes up and asks them if they want a toothbrush - c'mon classic stuff. Candy was Johnny Le Roux for those of you who remember SCTV, and here partnering with Levy they hit a great piece of fun. That's all this picture is is fun. Don't look for laugh a minute, and don't lok for sitcom TV, it's not. It's just a movie with a story about two guys who find themselves in situations that result in comedic performances that are pretty good. C'mon when he tells the truck driver at the end that he needs to get somehwere to save a friend while the southern truck driver is in the middle of a traffic jam and the guys says to Candy ""Well hop on in here slim!"" is classic."
2,"Really Two-and-one-half stars on normal scale, but Dir. Mark Lester screws this one up!","Take Eugene Levy (Puhleez!), his formerCanadian (R.I.P.)SC-TV alum John Candyand add 'Commando's' Dir., Harold Ramisand (!) James Keach (!!) to the writersand what do you have? An only moderatelyfunny John Candy movie! There are somegreat bits in here - but this movie isthe greatest waste of space (make thattalent!) since Greenland! Robert Loggiaand Meg Ryan are wasted in stupid stereo-typical roles. And Levy with Ryan?! Aboutas bad as Billy (Clipper-fan, his onlyredeeming quality!) Crystal with Ryan!Or Tom Hanks! Lester did better herethan with 'Commando',but is that reallysaying much!?"
4,A simple bit of fun,"I read some of my fellow viewer's comments; I have to say you people need to lightenup somewhat. This is not meant to be a sketch from the Royal Shakespeare Company. It is simple, corny, but fun! The scenario has already been written above, but I think Levy's banter with Candy, especially in the Peep show booth is hilarious. Also in the courthouse as Candy knocks Levy to the ground. ""Thanks a lot, made my day."" Great stuff! So, if you want to be entertained by pure stupid fun, go ahead, watch and enjoy yourself. This is a funny movie and not meant to impress pseudo-critics, of whom far too many adorn these pages."
3,Pretty Good,I was looking for thick cotton socks and this is the closest I could find. There's a bit too much acrylic in these (can be sweaty) but they're better than anything else I've found.
2,They just don't do it for me...,"The video is well done. The sound quality is good. On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd rate the music that the band plays at a 4. I just don't like it. I find it mediocre at best. It's nothing to do with ability, technique, or any of that. I watched it once and will probably never do so again."
2,*A TEDIOUS READ*,"This book had some humour, but for the most part I was bored. I did like the main female character but the men in her life were very frustrating. I really struggled to finish the story. For the ""erotic"" content; not enough and again boring. I did not find even the suspense part of the book capturing. I expected more of a mystery novel with some hot romance but I was left wanting and again struggling to complete the book. Hope this helps."
1,Sat in the warehouse too long,"When I received this pedometer, the display did not work. I don't know if the battery's dead or if there is some other problem with it. If I press on the display, I get some weird characters to flash, but that's it. I can't really review the functionality of the pedometer itself, sorry."
2,HoHum,"I was very excited about this book, based on reviews and the fact that he worked on Might Magazine. I wasn't really pleased. I kept reading, mostly because I finish every book I start. The ideas he had were entertaining but the product was horrible. The writing was totally uninspired and I wasn't laughing at all. Too bad, I was hoping for more..."
1,This CD makes a better Frisbee!,"I get more out of this CD using it as a mirror than I do playing what's on it. This guy is a horrible singer and should have his vocal cords ripped out. Then he can communicate on paper and not have to irritate the rest of us with his voice. A good singer understands what he's singing, can share his emotions with the audience through his voice, and has the vocal talent that makes us want to listen. Since Paul Hull has none of these qualities, I don't understand why he didn't become a male nurse. Skip past this one."
3,eh....,"This movie is just o.k. Like pretty much everyone else I bought it so I could drool over Adam Ant for an hour and a half. For that it was good. If there is an actor you have the hots for in this movie, it's worth buying. Otherwise.....skip it."
5,An excellent history and overview of math,"If you are interested in mathematics at all you must read this book. It manages to take a subject that can be downright boring to many, and turn it into an interesting account of math down through the ages. It not only provides the reader with a history of each topic in mathematics, as well as teaching about each topic, it also introduces the many, many men and women who have each advanced our knowledge of mathematics.I highly recommend this book."
1,R.E. Lee is J.C.!,"Crocker the Third describes R.E. Lee as the second coming and then develops articulate reasons why the slaves should not have been freed by the cursed Union, who fought against God, the angels, and of course the blessed Lee. It then applies these lessons to personal growth and leadership. I could only read a bit in the beginning. Then I had to take a shower."
5,5 Year Old Bottle Still Fresh & Like New!,"I just found a bottle of this Mandarin Magic Hair Gel in the back of my cabinet.It has been there for 5 years.I have used it twice since finding it and am very pleased with the results on my fine, loose curl hair.Amazing test of time results. Still smells fresh and consistency is like new. That's one more reason to love Aubrey Organics!{{* *}}"
1,Awful-seems too subjective,"I received this book from either my mom or my aunt who's quite religious. The authors seem very close-minded. It's a book for someone who is fanatically religious and some of the statements made in the book are a bit ridiculous, mentioning that movies like Harry Potter and Astrology is evil. Also, it's very discriminating against gays, the book gives the idea of homosexuality being unacceptable. There's also a typo on page 165 saying ""You many even feel proud of your new hairy look."" It had a few good points but overall it was so very one-sided. I didn't like it at all."
5,great book has influenced me greatly.,Armstrong takes a tough stand on how this therapy is able to be effective for any disease. Wish I had his biography to understand the man more.
5,pretty awesome helmet,let me start off by saying this helmet is awesome. Ive always wanted a helmet like this one but they all seem to be all beat up and old. This product is the complete opposite of that. Although its a little too big on me its great.I like the way it looks and the way it feels. Im also very glad that it came with the helmet band because another person that reviewed this helmet said his didnt come with one. Even though its a little big that doesnt matter because im only 13 it will probably fit me once i get older. I deffinetely recommend getting this helmet.
3,Not As Pictured,"It came without the ( pictured) elastic ban. The chin strap is hard (almost impossible) to work with. Other than that the helmet is in good condition. I got it to use on my motorcycle but with the inoperative chin strap, that is not going to happen."
4,Good restorer's companion,"I'm restoring a 1971 CB350 and although I haven't had the chance/need to really get into this book yet, but the odd couple of times I've referred to it, it's been really helpful.Great step by step instructions that reference well labeled pictures have made things really easy.It's also pointed out a few tools to me that I never would've thought of.No-brainer purchase for anyone wanting to maintain/restore one of these bikes."
2,Better than old one,"I have both the new book and the old one - the new one is better, but I agree with the other reviewer above that it misses the mark. It lacks full specifications, forcing you to go to the dealer or surf the web. I do recommend it (its cheap), but buy it as a thin reference guide only."
5,A Show To Be Seen and Heard,"I saw the first production of this show at Stratford, where the cast included some veteran members of the Royal Shakespeare Company. I thought it was amazing how Mr Taylor managed to weave Shakespeare's own words into lyrics and how true he was to the spirit and the characters. There are some wonderful songs in this show and they all work very well on stage, fitting in very smoothly with the story and helping to move things along at a rollicking pace. The singers on this recording are all excellent and the music captures the spirit of the period. Even those who do not like Shakespeare would find it highly enjoyable.... I think it is a great work and deserves to be seen and heard more often."
1,Garbage!,"The worst video you can imagine....I would suggest NOT buying this, or you will be disappointed!I cannot believe this man would charge $30, or even $5 for this horrible home video.This terribly made video is a man telling a class of 15 or so people to put their hands close together to feel the energy. Then he gets them to look across the room, and try to see someone's aura. He just says blur your eyes and try to see it. Now you've just read the whole lesson...you don't need to buy it, lol.In the second half of the movie, he calls on a spirit and pretends it has entered his body. I believe this is possible for people to do, but I'm pretty darn sure he hasn't done this in the video. There is no purpose for this, as this 'entity' has no relevant knowledge to offer!"
1,Crips and Bloods Made in America,"Thinly disguised as a documentary when in fact it is propaganda from the likes of tom hayden, even the Fascist nation of islam. Apparently the solution is government funding and nanny state instead of personal responsibility. At least that is the impression stacy peralta gives you. ""The Man"" and other old clichés from the left. I Applaud sincere efforts for better parenting,but as for not locking up criminals it is silly and unrealistic,TAKE responsibility."
5,"Terrific book for students, activists and everybody!","This is an excellent collection of chapters by experts who are clear, articulate and accessible to a general audience. The focus is on policy strategies to raise women's incomes, which still only average 55% of men's in this country.The policies discussed are* implementing real welfare reform* paying people for parenting* increasing public subsidies for childcare* reforming social security to benefit older women* increasing the minimum wage* re-focusing the movement for pay equity* organizing more women in unions* strengthening affirmative action* opening the trades to women, and* encouraging women and girls to enter math-based occupations.Strong introductory and concluding chapters make the case for the need to raise women's incomes, and point out the potential of a broadly-based, multi-pronged political effort to do just that."
3,doesn't fit with backseat headrests,"This booster seat looks wonderful, but it will not fit in my Volvo because of the non-removable back seat headrests. The headrests cause the back of the booster to be too far away from the seat back. I just bought another brand of booster with a curvier back and it works fine in the Volvo back seat.Too bad, because my daughter loved the purple flowers on this booster."
2,Not For ChryslerTown and Country or Dodge Caravan,Well I liked the booster seat at first and then my daughter fell asleep and she fell completely over the armrest the opposite side of the seat belt..that does not seam very safe for my child....another thing is that my seat are so upright in position that she sat like she was in a prision being made to sit up with her back straight as a board..not very comfortable....unless you van has captains chairs in the middle seat this booster seat is not for you.....also the way my seats are shaped the booster seat leans from side to side evertime i made a remotely sharp turn...that also does not seam very safe to me...if they just made a latch booster seat with those pretty colors my daughter would be in heaven and so would moms peace of mind
1,VERY poorly made power cord.,"I rarely write reviews, but I felt this one was very important to do. I purchased this as a replacement power cord for my Thinkpad six months ago, and it worked fine for the first month or so. The powercord plug began to not work consistently in the outlet. The electricity would not flow from the outlet through the powercord continually - it would suddenly stop. Today, the grounding prong on the plug stuck in the outlet when I removed the plug from the outlet. I was very glad it was the grounding prong and not one of the live prongs that broke off from the plug. Unfortunately, I will have to order another one of these cords and hope that it is MUCH better made."
2,not as advertised,"they sent a 3 prong and i need a 2 prong adapter for travel (as in the picture)!amazon was no help and i tried to contact the seller, but this was next to impossible.the 3 prong works fine, just don't care for pictures on a website that are not consistent with the product sent.i will be happy to remove this review if/when the seller tries to fix the problem."
5,Good product,"This is a charger, nothing to say besides that it work as expected and looks like a brand new, genuine lenovo product"
1,Broken in 2 months,Read the other reviews and couldn't believe it would break that fast - it has. Bought in November and the cord covering has separated from the plug exposing the wires. Tape will probably work for a while but this is poorly made.
1,"Good, Lightweight adapter- but broke in 2 months","The adapter works perfectly for my T60. The cord is very long so it reaches practically anywhere. The battery pack is slightly smaller and lighter than I was expecting which was very nice. It also comes with a velcro tie which is convenient. Overall, very nice product.Update: I bought the adapter in March. It is now April and broken. It might just be mine, but this adapter seems defective"
2,Broken in 3 months,Much lighter than the original adapter which is usually a sign of poor quality IMHO. Also only two prong power cord which is probably why it shorted out after a small static electricity shock hit me. Not very good quality.
5,Laptop power adapter,"65W Ultaport Ac Adapter UWanted a second power adapter for travel. This is an original equipment adapter by Lenovo. Good price, good delivery, good product."
1,Caught On Fire - Flames,"We bought 8 of these for work do to the great price. I was working on a Lenovo T420 with this adapter when I heard a popping sound and smelled something. I didn't know what it was at first until sparks shot up a good 2 feet in the air. Then a decent size flame ignited on the cord. Fortunately a couple of us were in the room and able my coworker was brave enough to yank it out of the wall and put the fire out. Do NOT buy these, I'll be writing Lenovo immediately."
1,Don't waste your money,"If you want to purchase an AC adapter, it is better to buy an official product from Lenovo. Even the official product is not really reliable but at least they won't get short and gets spark or some sort of explosion."
2,So much unexpected work.,This rail is OK. Not a favorite nor will I recommend this. I would've liked more pictures and description of the end hinge piece as it did not fit my foot/head board as well. We had to customize it and add screws and holes of our own. I used this rail for my 4 in 1 crib conversion for my daughter and it needed a lot of customizing to it. The rail is not as sturdy as I had hoped. We placed the foam mattress on it and with the boxed frame and it didn't caved down in the middle in a little over a month. My husband had to build additional cross railings to help stabilize the bed and frame with post through out the rail so it will stay in place without caving in. SO much work that was unexpected.
5,Great undies!,"Nice to have added lining that is so comfortable and pretty! For winter, it offers warmth and is so modern. I love these."
3,Good product if taken care of.,"Batteries are not replaceable which wasn't stated when I bought mine. MAKE SURE you do not charge unless it is completely dead for extended life. Other thing is that the design makes the spinning rod VERY easy to throw off balanced if even so slightly becomes bent, and the more you bend to fix the worse it gets; rendering the frother nothing more than an automated stirrer. DONT let the kids get there hangs on it! Avoid those two things and it is worth the money."
3,Great while it lasted,"We were very pleased with the frother when we got it, it worked great, made a good froth and we took care to recharge it only when the battery ran down, but 3 months after we bought it, one morning it suddenly stopped working, completely dead."
5,"""Sometimes the most expensive isn't the best""","After first trying this product with no problems or issues, I thought I would give a more expensive frother a chance. None of them froth milk as well and as quickly as the BonJour Frother.Yes, you have to pop in microwave to heat up milk, but the clean up and easiness, is worth the extra step! I'm back with my BonJour and won't stray again!!!"
2,Disapointed,"Many previous reviewers were right, the batteries do not last very long. We used this item several times a day and charged it only when is was almost discharged. It last just a few months. When it was new it worked great. We then went back to a standard frother using alkaline batteries. They only last a couple of weeks.Today after it had been sitting in my garage for a few months I was getting ready to throw it away when I decided to see if could be fixed, I do that to almost all things that break, I can't help myself, I am an engineer. Seeing no screws I resorted to brut force and grabbed it with both hands and tried to break it in two. To my amazement, it came apart and revealed two replaceable NiMH batteries. It snaps back togher also. It had AA 600mAh batteries inside. I ordered 4 POWEREX AA 2700mAH for $14 though Amazon. The higher capacity batteries should make it last much longer between charges."
4,good but short,"This film was quite interesting, but very brief. It would be great to know if this type of treatment has received a positive review from the majority of people taking advantage of it. Has the price of the treatment decreased? Will insurance ever pay for it? Is it still being used?"
3,Not like it used to be...,"My kids enjoy playing with this, but I was so disappointed in it. First of all, it uses sharp ""teeth"" to grab onto the pole instead of magnets like the one I played with as a kid did. It's not very easy getting the pole to catch just right on the teeth and the kids can get pretty frustrated when they can't catch any fish. Second, it goes really fast! Again making it difficult for little kids to catch any fish. And lastly, there is no music like it states in the description but it is REALLY LOUD!Overall it's cheaply made and doesn't live up to it's description and pales in comparison to the original fishing game that used magnets to catch the fish. But my boys have fun playing with it and I got it for half the price it's going for now."
2,Not the same game we grew up with,"We had this game growing up and loved it. Like most toys, now that everything is made so cheaply overseas, this was a huge disappointment. It is very cheaply made. When it arrived many of the fish were already missing their sticker eyes...and the rest came off within just a few uses. The poles used to have a thick string on the end (um, like a fishing pole!) but these are plastic that get stuck at the hinge. Overall it's just cheap. I wish we would've saved our game from the early 90s...sure it still would've worked better than this one."
1,Should have been recalled,"When I first got this toy, my kids loved it and I did too. We had lots of fun. However, I want to address that this toy can be a hazard. My son almost lost his finger with this game! I'm not sure if this has been recalled. A toddler/kid can stick their fingers on an empty fish slot while the game is on and can get their fingers caught in it. I turned off the game quickly, but the gears have already caught my sons finger really bad and it was impossible to unscrew those tiny screws! I tried to get his finger free for like 5-10+ mins. to no avail. I had to call my husband at work to come home (and my mom-in-law who was in town) to help me. My son was screaming and crying and fingers almost turning blue. Thankfully, my husband works about 5 minutes from home and yanked the toy apart to save my boys' finger. Needless to say, we threw that toy away and would never buy it again."
2,Just ok,Toy was broken and missing pieces. I will never buy games from Amazon again. I am sure that this is not a problem with Amazon. I bought 2 games from them and one was broken and the other was missing a piece.
2,Too fast! Not for toddler!,My 22 months girl couldn't catch at all.It's hard enough to me.It really needs speed control option.(slow and fast - at least)Also this is very loud!
4,3 Cheers for the Fish,"I have 2 grandchildren approx. 2-1/2 yrs old. They were about 2 when I purchased this. They enjoy it when they come over. We play together for about 10 - 15 minutes which is about their attention span right now, but it is a toy they will bring out to play with where many are gathering dust.Its easy enough for a 2 year old and fun enough for an older child to play with it. A younger child will hold the pole rather than letting the string hang down and stick the pole into the mouth of fish. They get a kick out of catching them.It's a game they will always come back for."
1,Don't bother - too fagile for kids,"Just like the Alian game, this one too is far too fagile for children to play. the ""fishing pole"" is flimsey and the ""hook"" snaps right off (choaching hazard). Without the hook on the pole the game cannot be played. The poles break at the joint then they are too short to use. The fish jaws snap off and they break easily at the connection point as well.Seriously, this one is just another version of a super cheap, flimsy, use it once and send it to the landfill kind of game. Don't bother.I can't believe the company pumped this toy out after the marketplace expience with the Alian toy."
1,Disappointed:(,We got this toy for Christmas for our little girl and we just opened it for game night for the first time. Put a new battery in it and turned it on but all it did was make the motorized noise. Tried another brand new battery from a different pack and it did the same thing. My daughter is making the best of it and just fishing anyways but you can't actually play the game so she was pretty disappointed.
1,Cheap plastic,"This game was fun for my child while it lasted. The problem is after only a few uses, it started to fall apart. This toy would of rated higher for fun had it not started to auto-destruct from use. Sadly, it has joined the rest of the inferiorly made games at the dump."
1,no longer sold or supportd by Red Hat,"Red Hat's legacy Linux operating system, launched in 1994. Predecessor of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and the Fedora Project. Last version available was Red Hat Linux 9.Was $39.95 to $149.95. No longer available for sale - this directly from the Red Hat website.Try SuSE - better product anyway!"
2,Pay for the support or shop else where,"I used Unix many years ago and thought it could be a fun to install Linux in my old desktop. Without understanding the status of Red Hat Linux or the available choices, I bought an used Red Hat Linux 9. The installation was not a problem but I quickly ran into a series of problems that my 3Com wireless USB and USB mouse do not work and the Firefox that came with the Linux could not open Google's webpage.After some study on the internet, I realized that Red Hat Linux 9 was so old that it requires a lot of update to work with the new hardware or the latest websites. Unless one is willing to pay the annual charge to Red Hat, Linux fan should look for other options."
1,Is the Pope Catholic?,"Pennington has fanned an arid wind over a dry topic. Heads were banging on desks when we discussed this in my senior history seminar. Nevertheless, the second chapter is comendable for its brevity."
1,Dangerous book,"This book has a few good things in it but she is not trained in mental health disorders and has misrepresented personality disorders.It sounds like she has had experience only with men and relationships that are violent and abusive and chosen her baseline for ALL men which someone with thisclose contact with DV has a biased negative view of men.I recommend anyone using this book should be under the care of a trained therapist BEFORE, DURING and AFTER this book is read to ask their therapist what is validabout her points and what is way off the mark and actually angry at men.Dangerous!!"
2,I should have gone,My doctor recommended this book when my husband left me. I did not get any help from this book. Perhaps it was me and not the book. I would not tell any of my friends to order this book.
5,Feeling stuck in the middle? This book is pure guidance.,I searched for guidance and self-help books to help me with the agonizing decision of where I should turn when my husband & separated. Most books out there were 'how to make a better marriage' or 'how to cope with divorce'. There was nothing in the middle until I discovered this book. I read the book in one day and actually took a highlighter and highlighted the parts that hit home. I have a completely different outlook on what separation can do for a marriage. It doesn't necessarily mean the end to a relationship but possibly a new beginning.
3,DS Hobit,I bought this game for my son. He seemed to enjoy it. It was one of those games he played a number of times.
4,Fascinating Time Capsule of 1960s Perception of Homosexuality,"Daringly forthright, this suspenseful story of blackmail (expertly performed by a great cast led by Dirk Bogarde) is a valuable time capsule of the pervasive homophobia that dominated all reaches of 1960s society. There are great, timeless moments that remind the audience of simultaneously how far and how little we have progressed since then.A 30 minute television interview from 1961 with Bogarde is also quite interesting, particularly for American audiences who may only be peripherally aware of his wonderful work on the stage, in film and as an author."
1,I think this chair is made for large/heavy people,"This chair forces the normal body into an awkward position and there is no way to adjust it. The reclining mechanism uses your own body weight as a counterbalance, and there is no way to adjust the tension. The chair looks really cool, but the comfort is poor. What a mistake."
3,Great chair except for the arms,"I've had my HumanScale Freedom chair for 2.5 years and there's a lot to love about it. The automatic adjustments and back support are superb.The arms, however, are its Achilles heel. First, they're hard to adjust correctly, but more importantly, they're very brittle. We have half a dozen of these chairs in the office and every one of them has had problems with the plastic bits that anchor the arms to the frame breaking. Some of our chairs have been repaired twice. Even though I have taken scrupulous care never to push down on the the arms when I stand up, one of the arms on my chair has still failed.The good news is that other reviewers report that the company has a lifetime warranty and is good about facilitating repairs. I sure hope it's true."
2,great for short periods,"I borrowed one of these while recovering from a severe pinched nerve and needed strong shoulder support. I found the chair great in that aspect, and I loved that it would adjust to my seating position instead of having to move a bunch of levers.The big problem is that I can't sit in the chair for much more than an hour. There's hardly any padding in the seat, so after I while my butt gets sweaty and starts to hurt. Other chairs seem to have solved this problem by having either a mesh seat or a lot of padding. Not sure how they messed this up.Maybe this is a subtle way of encouraging us to get up and walk around every hour or so. If so, that's not what I was looking for. Even after taking a 5-10m break, sitting back down still hurt.Too bad; otherwise it's a remarkable chair."
4,Fact or Fiction in Detail,I read this book with a basic knowledge of what happened on the last days in the life of George Custer. There was a great deal of research into all of the happenings of The Battle of the Little Bighorn. This book covers a great deal of information that will be useful for other researchers or anyone interested in history. The conclusions drawn by the author are insightful and educated. It is definitely a keeper.
3,Looks good but....,"Has a poor sound quality, the speakers are cheap and the reception of FM stations leaves a lot to be desired. Very easy to use and prgram. Overall, I think it is a bit pricey for what it delivers, like most of Philips products has a very nice design but the quality is a bit on the lower side."
1,Jake is a little snake,"My 2 year old son is semi-obsessed with vacuums right now so naturally, I looked for a book that would incorporate his current passion into our night time reading. I was so excited to find this book online and anxiously awaited its arrival. The story is not at all what I expected. Jake is not merely mischievous - he is a downright brat. When his mom tells him to vacuum, he sucks up everything around the house including her. The book ends up stating that Jake is never asked to vacuum again, which was his goal to begin with. I realize this is just a fictional story, but I can really do without Jake's attitude and so can my son. What a disappointment. I will exercise my library card instead of my credit card from now on."
3,"Ok, but don't expect much.","The organizer is nice, if you're looking for a glorified pen and paperclip holder, but beyond that, it's not really anything special. The tape dispenser is a nice add on, but consistently pops free. The rotary under it is also fairly cheap and doesn't really spin. You'd be hard pressed to get a full 360 degree turn out of it, but then again, why would you really need to? Overall, it's fine if you just need something to lessen clutter, but don't expect much else."
3,"Not great, just OK","The fabric is OK but nothing special. It is not soft. The words/graphics printed on the shirt are fuzzy around the edges and look gooey so washing and ironing may crack, smudge or otherwise erase them over time. For the price, I would have preferred a better quality shirt. Nonetheless, it looks exactly like the tshirt featured in the image. The downside of shopping online is always that you can't touch the merchandise. Also, I was told that some part of the code should fall on another line. I'm not technologically inclined so I'll have to take their word for it."
2,Not for professional use,"This product was disappointing. I was expecting a professional clapboard that I could use for my film classes, but instead all I got was a childrens toy. It's smaller than a laptop keyboard, made of wood glued together, and it feels like the clap part is going to break off everytime you use it. This would make an alright gift for a child, but is not meant for professional use."
3,Movie clapper,My son in law has a movie room and wanted to decorate it with movie memorabilia.This was a great addition.
1,Really Bad Quality,These feel like sandpaper - seriously. Even after washing. I never used them and for me they were a total waste of money. They do look like they would fit very securely on a mattress though.
1,very thin and it will slide on you,"This mat is very thin and is not skid proof. If you have this on a tile floor and try to do any standing yoga forms it will slide a bit too much. I had purchased a similar mat on sale one time but that one was slide proof, made of a more flexible ( rubberized ) material than this one. This blue one looked the same but was not; I ended up cutting this one I purchased here up and using it to line tool cabinet drawers."
4,Great Value!!,"I am kind of suspicious about Phillips products. I have collected only positive experiences with this brand.I bought this clock because I wanted a nice and inexpensive battery operated AM clock I could listen while shaving in the morning.The clock delivered it all with an awesome ease of use, packed in an excellent design. The only downside I could find is the difficult to read the dial, making it a guess exercise to find the desired station."
3,Good enough to buy two,"We bought one of these to see if it would work, then bought another right away. It's the right depth for a kitchen cabinet, and the steps are an appropriate height for spice bottles."
3,Works but has its limits,This light is bright and the movement is fine but it has two flaws. One is it has a ten minute on ten minute off duty cycle. Two it takes 96 db to get it to function.
3,Short Lived,"Bought it two weeks ago. It was pretty cool, have to admit. That was till' it fell a short distance halfway through the first party I used it for and the bulbs' filaments exploded. Now I have a broken strobe light.Also, this thing gets extremely hot. Like, touch it while it's on and prepare for 1st degree burns hot."
2,Tastes like wet cardboard smells,"I was amazed when I read the label stating that this item had no fat or cholesterol, and fairly low sugar content, so I was happy. Unfortunately,it tastes like wet cardboard smells. I will not be ordering it again. I hope this helps."
4,"very good, but the puzzles are not what i expected.","I havent gotten very far into the game, and i have to admit i did have to cheat and go online for some help in some of the puzzles. Other than that, its what i expected, only thing i can say is that, the puzzles are..... be ready for the puzzles- or should i say, have a cheatsite ready for the puzzles."
4,Great game...too short,"Being a huge fan of the book and now the movie, I was excited about this game. The puzzles were too easy for the most part. Only one or two had me for any length of time, if I could call it that because I beat this game in about 6 or 7 hours. I would have liked to see difficulty levels. I feel like I played this game on the easiest setting. Now don't get me wrong I did like this game a lot. There are many good things about this game. The minor deviations from the book were great...The location renders were awesome...I think I spent at least an hour just wondering around, looking at things, not really trying to solve the puzzles presented. All and all I would recommend renting it instead of buying it because the time it took to finish didn't merit the money spent."
4,Forensic Biography,"Even though, as others have correctly observed below, this biography was written some time before Stanley Kubrick's death, Lobrutto is about as well equipped to write definitively about this one-of-a-kind filmmaker as anyone would be.Kubrick died just after completing ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" and those who were critically unkind to that effort would conclude that he'd about run out of steam.It's understandable. The more we learn about Kubrick's personal life here, the less we understand his art. He was and remained an extremely private and elusive man, and simply pursued his various compulsions as they occasioned. The results are what we see on the screen, of course.Lobrutto's a good writer; you'll enjoy the effort a great deal."
2,Utter cr*p,Vincent LoBrutto actually managed the impossible. He made the subject of Stanley Kubrick Boring. If you are a fan of Stanley Kubrick (like me) and are interested in purchasing a biography I'd suggest the one written by John(?) Baxter. It's ten times better.
2,for die-hard Kubrick fans only,"Let me start off my saying that I am a die-hard Kubrick fan, especially of his films Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, and 2001. And I enjoyed this book enough because it dealt with the process by which my favourite films were made. But, as carefully researched and meticulously deatiled as Stanley Kubrick: A biography is, the writing is flat and ineffectual. It feels as if a fifth grade student got a hold of tons of info about an interesting subject---then wrote a D- report. Informative, interesting, but if you're just looking for a good read, look elsewhere."
1,Contradictory summaries sowing seeds of confusion,"I dislike this book because some of the summaries contradict the Church documents they quote. The Church documents are not given in their entirety, but only a paragraph here and there. This book has the potential to sow seeds of doubt and dissent of authentic magisterial teaching."
5,WORTH THE WAIT !,"If you've been waiting for a long time for this , like me , you won't be disappointed . It ain't low cost , but a lot of work has gone into it . The usual Criterion attention to detail and design add to the experience . You will enjoy this set more if you have a surround system and DTS capability . Don't expect thundering bass , it hasn't been toyed with at the expense of the music - rather , updated .The booklet puts it into context , although I always wonder about people who write about places/things/events when they weren't there themselves . Leave the secondhand stuff out and listen to the commentaries about Jimi and Otis . The writers know a lot about their subjects - I would strongly recommend Peter Guralnick's books on Elvis to fans . Mr Guralnick helps Elvis come across as human , which is quite a feat when you think about it . Buy and enjoy - save up if you have to ."
4,The Complete Monterey Pop Festival,Very good purchase. 3 good CD's plus interesting Booklet. Some footage is a little bit amatuerist but thats what i expected. Footage of Tiny Tim shows just what a nutter he is.
3,an important perspective on creek history,"the author brings a unique view of the creek nation's little known history to light, with tens of southerners of documented descent from removal-era Creeks, this book is a great addition to your library on SE Indian history."
4,Cat called little bird,"Whilst i was in year 8 at Langly Park School for Girls i read a most fasinating book. It was set in the Middle Ages and the appealing tittle was 'Catherine called Birdy'by Karen Cushman. I found it increadibly well thought out, the book was a diary supposedly written by Catherineabout her life. Each chapter reprisented a monthand all in all the book told us a whole year about Catherines exciting life as a growing woman. I found Cat's events engaging and well detailed. The story's of how she managed to keep away all the suitors set up by her father were very different but incredibly funny. I thouroughly enjoyed this book and would defintly suggest it to read."
4,Birdy,I thought this was a wonderful chronicle of a feisty young girl's life in the Middle Ages. I would have liked to have read it when I was 14.
3,Catherine called birdy by Allie,"Catherine is an average girl with a wild and humurous imagination. She has a big problem though. Her father is arranging a marrage for her and she has to wed some big, fat, ugly, gross pig! She calls him ""Shaggy Beard"" because he is so gross. He loves her but she really doesnt love him at all.I think this book it man vs. man because Catherine is kind of againsd every one accept for a few people. One theme in the book is marrage becausee they talk about it alot. Catherine Called Birdy is a good book and i fully recomend it to other students. This story is said in 3rd person because the author doesnt narrate it. It is also a great learning process. Kids don't even realize they're reading, and learning at the same time."
2,Sam's Reveiw,"Catherine,Called Birdy,written by Karen Cushman is about a young girl whos dad is forcing her to get married to the oldest,meanest,and revolting man she has ever met. Catherine wants to move out and have an adventure of a life time,but her father and her soon-to-be husband will not let her leave.Perkin, the man that her father wants to marry off to her daughter, is the most laziest,most stubborn man. Whenever Perkin sees Catherine he winks at her and it makes her sick to her stomach. She is so scared to tell her father she doesnt want to marry him, and will never love him. George, the man that Catherine loves is trying to get her to leave with him, but they have to figure out a way to escape with out her father and Perkin knowing. It took them four and a half days to find a plan. Then all they had to do is escape to a land that they will never be able to find..."
3,"Cathrine Called Birdy, 1290's girl","Cathrine called birdy is an okay book. All of my friends are reading so I tried it. I didn't really like it as much as i thought it would be. She thinks of her father as a Beast and her dad is selling her like cheese for her marrige. Then someone wishes to marry her. She will not consent. If she does she will be Lady Shaggy Beard. Shaggy Baerd is ugly un mannered beast! But by some mysterious accedent he dies, leaving her to marry his son Stevon. During this time, she runs off, and helped her mother with her new baby girl. With i brother as a monk, another who works with the King, and one the Adominable Robert. Then her best friend, Aleis is marrrying Robert but she is not that happy about it. This book is one for the historcal aspect and loves Medival Times."
1,BORING!!,"If any of you have to read this book as an a requirment, I feel so bad for you. It's the worst book I ever read, because it was so slow and boring. My mom even tried to read it and said the same thing. I'm so thankful that I didn't have to read it as a requirment, and was able to change books. If you take my advice and not read this book, you'll be thankful too."
2,"Horrible! If you call this new, how bad is old!","Ok, so were reading this book in school, and my teacher tells us that if we have our own copy so we can take notes in she will give us 5 points extra credit on the next exam. So ofcourse i order the book, and i wanted a new copy, with fresh pages and a nice new glossy cover. What i got was a book with yellow pages, a scratched up cover with a sticker on it. To make matters worse when i ripped off the sticker some of the cover came off! I dont know how this is considered new, it may be true that noone used this book, but the condition can not be considered new. Do not trust these people, they will rip you off!"
2,"Catherine Called Birdy By, Justin","This book was a terrible book. It was very slow moving and I do not suggest it to anyone. I think it was written just to have a book written. From this, the book seemed very rushed and disorganized. An example of this is when Catherine talks of the Queen's death just to fill up pages. Parts of the book were a little too exact about the Middle Ages. For example, talking about pigs and goats was too much detail. Also the book had an awful ending. Through out the book, Catherine says she wants to expand to better things. In the end she decides to be happy with her horrible boring life, instead of traveling and being a crusader. In a way though this was somewhat of a good thing because, Catherine learned to be who she is. When I say this I mean she wanted to have a different life, but she realized she is who she was born."
1,Catherine Called Birdy,"Catherine Called Birdy is about a 14 year old girl who lives in the Middle Ages and her name is Catherine. She writes in a journal and her mother and fathercall her Little Birdy. Her father wants to marry her off to the richest man he can find.But,Catherine doesn't want to get married yet.Catherine likes a goat boy.She has an uncle named George who likes a girl named Aelis. Aelis gets married to an 8 year old boy. A guy named Shaggy Beard wants to marry Catherine. Catherine ends up marrying someone else. If you want to find out read the book and find out!"
1,Buyer Beware - This glassware is paper thin.,"I ordered 2 sets of 2, canteen style Bodum glasses. They sounded like such a good idea, lovely design. Well, I never got to try them. All four glasses arrived smashed to smithereens, hundreds of pieces of glass as if they had exploded. Part of the problem was almost no packing in the box, however, I think they would have arrived broken anyway. This glass is practically paper thin, almost thin as a Christmas ornament. What a disappointment. Supposedly, I'm getting a full refund. Save yourself the hassle."
5,My Favorite Movie,I love this movie. I like this version a tad bit better than the original version simply because it's updated.
3,Missing Song?,"When I watched the movie, I sussinctly remember listening to Ray Charles's ""Ev'ry time we say goodbye"". I couldn't remember if it had Betty Carter or if it was just him, so I looked up the soundtrack. Surprisingly it was not there. I read some of the reviews and others mentioned amissing song. I don't know why it isn't on the CD, but it should be seeing as it was one of the movies best songs. There are some other good songs too, Here Comes the Sun and There She Goes, but I didn't buy this CD and I'm glad I did not."
4,Excellent for what they are.,"First, the tip caps are designed to protect the contents while standing up. They are friction-fit, and thus these are not suitable for use in a portable kit of any kind unless you use elastic or some other means to secure the caps.They are petroleum-safe. I use mine to dispense small amounts of 10W40 synthetic motor oil precisely.For the price, how effective they are, and the amount of use I will get out of them, they easily earn 4 stars. If the tip caps screwed on or otherwise secured well enough to pack one of these in a go-bag with no other method of securing it, they would earn 5 stars, easily. If you want to use these in a go bag, a strip of elastic, a properly secured rubber band, etc, will secure the tip cap just fine. If I do use one of these that way, I'll keep it in a ziploc bag as well, just to be safe."
1,One Dollar Per Minute?,"I have read a lot about this film, but I'm still in the dark on a few things. Is the film heterosexual, homosexual, or what? It won a feminist award, and that confuses me even more.It sounds interesting and I might like to see it, but not $30 for a 30 minute short."
2,Doesn't match description,"I thought there would be more story than what was presented. While I appreciated the intimacy, that seemed to be the crux of the story. Intellectually didn't keep my mind in the story."
3,Matinee DVD,"This movie was very short. Although the film accomplished it objective, the characters were poorly identified. The best part of the film was the interview conducted of the writer, director."
5,The best ever!!,I have read many books on the subject over the past 10 years or so. This tome is by far the most extensive and easy to read. I recommend a combination of the book and the CD which is also available (for easy access as the book is heavy). The CD has diagrams in color as well. The author has put a huge amount of work into this work and he deserves all the credit he can get. This book is destined to become a classic.
1,Overpriced card shuffler,"The description for this shuffler states that it is a deluxe model and that it takes ""C"" batteries, it does not. The shuffler uses ""AA"" battieries. The same shuffler sells from many other vendors on Amazon for less than $10.00. No reason to spend $25.99 for a shuffler when you can get it for far less."
4,Saves Me So Much Time!,"I have many of Dr. Fry's series of spelling and vocabulary books. This is one of the best! I spent months making up my own activities for my weekly spelling words, only to discover that this book would've done it for me!I like that there are two sets of word searches for each week's words. One has the words listed only horizontally, while the other word search is much more challenging. I also like that there are cut-apart sheets listing the words, so the children can study using flashcards at home.All in all, one of Dr. Fry's best!"
2,Zach,I Really enjoy this Cd really great old German wehrmacht music. I just thought I'd let people know that Amazons track listing for it is wrong there are actually 28 songs on the Cd and Ich hatt' einen Kameraden is not included.
5,A Cowboy History Must Read,"I ordered this book for my husband as he loves wearing custom made cowboy hats. The book is a history of cowboy hat making and also of the cowboys who wear them. The pictures are excellent, well written and a good resource book for cowboy history buffs. An excellent purchase."
3,Worx 2-inch 18 -volt cordless electric hedge trimmer,I liked the light weight feature and not having to deal with an electric cord.
4,Worx Hedge Trimmer,"The quality of the trimmer is good, design and balance is fine and it is easy to use. I wish the battery would last longer."
1,Was good for the 20 minutes it worked,"I bought this product thinking it would be really convenient. When I got it was fairly straight forward to assemble it. I tried it briefly and seemed to work, but was not charged. So I charged it. After what seemed like over an hour, it was not fully charged, but I figured close enough.I used it for about 20 minutes and it ran out of juice. So I put it back on the charger. The green light stayed on and wouldn't charge. I remember someone else posting it needed to be ""cold"" to charge so I left it unplugged for over an hour and tried again, no good. The light stayed green, got a few seconds of charge and died. I tried several times over the course of 2 days and finally gave up and sent it back to Amazon. It seemed pretty good while it lasted, but I figured if it was this faulty it was probably not high enough quality to be worth getting a replacement."
4,Nice Trimmer,"Works really well. Wish the battery would last a little longer, but for medium size jobs, this is the ticket! Very well constructed and Amazon is the only place I'll purchase any of these products in the future. I received a bad trimmer and they sent a replacement immediately with return instructions of the old one, which was also postage paid. That's real customer service! I had thrown away the packaging material from the first one, but was able to use the packaging from the replacement to send back the defective one. Wouldn't have been able to do it if I had to return the bad one first! Thanks Amazon! I'm a customer for life!"
3,Worx doesn't work as stated,"I was excited to receive my rechargeable trimmer. However, on a full charge it didn't last more than 15-20 minutes. It's ok for small jobs but if you have a lot of trimming you would be better off with a power cord version."
3,Fight and Knowledge = FUN !???,"This game is fun. The puzzles are hard and I used [...] to get through the cryptography ones, but the rest are fun. The game follows the basic story as the book: fonding the grail (Mary) but goes to different places. While at the different areas you will see different painting and learn about ancient civilizations not metioned in the book (like Roman gods and goddeses) and are able to look at the stuff you seen in a menue where you can read more about them. This is one of two features I love about this game. The other feature is the fights where you press a series of bottons to knock out your enemys. It is quite fun! I would never think Robert Langdon would be beating up police and monks! I only rented this game and i have not beaten it, BUT I LOVE IT!"
2,Boring,"Who in there right mind gave the okay for a game based on the Da Vinci Code. Sure the movie was okay, but it was boring and so is the game. The game is exactly like the movie. It is never challenging or even interesting. I was given the game as a gift as I would have never bought it myself."
2,The Book Is SOOOOO Much Better,"First off, I loved Dan Brown's book. It was a really well written piece of work. But this game.........OH MY GOD!!! Okay, so I don't completely lose my control, I'll list my opinions in a good and bad list.THE GOOD- GOOD IDEA- PUZZLES ALSO A GOOD IDEA- STEALTH WORKS- WEAPONS WORKTHE BAD- THE VOICEOVERS- THE CHARACTERS THAT LOOK NOTHING LIKE THEIR COUNTERPARTS- THE COMBAT SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE- THE GRAPHICS ARE VERY, VERY BLAND- WHILE YOU'RE ATTACKING A GUARD, ONE OF HIS LITTLE BUDDIES RUNS OVER AND GRABS YOU, THEREFORE PREVENTING THE ATTACKOverall, this was a good idea that could've been a lot better. Actually, I think 2K Games should've just gotten their dirty little paws off of this game and left it at the book. This really isn't a game at all. It's a piece of crap!!"
4,Good for a Start,"The level of detail wasn't what I was hoping for, but it was a good book anyway. This book gives an overview of most aspects of marketing and selling food specialties.After reading this book, you'll want to get some companion books, such as a book on trade shows, or getting publicity, or any of a dozen ideas the author touches on."
5,get out the sandpaper,"When I turned the board over,it left a 2 inch sliver of wood in my pant leg. Sand all edges before using."
1,Warning,"Be sure to note that the artist of this CD is Party People, and not the actual original singers of the songs."
1,Probably the worst lighter ever,"After a short time, this lighter requires several attempts to get lit, adjustment of the spark gap, etc."
3,Classic 1960's album,"This album Has just 2 good tracks, White bird,Bombay calling...... But The Album Cover is a Classic"
5,A Long Time Searching,"I have been searching for a copy of this CD for what seems like decades. I had the original on vinyl and unfortunately it disappeared. Listening to it again so many years later brought back such wonderful memories. I had also forgotten how pure and clean the music is. In this day of ""anyone can make a record with the right band and special effects"" this is a breath of fresh air. The harmony and clarity of the voices at times gives me shivers. It's a shame they are no longer together and making beautiful music."
1,I hate this cd it is the worst cd I have ever listened to.,When I first listened to this cd i thought it was so bad that i which i could go to every store and brake all the cd's of these songs that is if she is rich enough to afford to put them in stores!!!!!How do you feel now huh?
3,Classy,Beautiful item but I had to return it because my ponytail was too thin (postpartum hair)--it just fell right off. Was afraid to keep for later for the price. Great service from Silver Insanity though.
3,Not as pictured!,Crayola now offers markers made from recycled plastic. All markers are black! I purposely ordered these because they were picutred on the site to be the original white plastic with the colored stripes that match the caps. It is very difficult for students to grab the right color (assuming more than one have the caps off). It also makes it difficult to get the caps back on the right marker. Not always does the tip appear to be the color it does on paper. I am disappointed that I received the ones I was trying to avoid getting.
4,Contains a good selection of opera scores,"Contains the bulk of famous tenor arias for lyric and lyric-dramatic voices. Scores are from operas like La Boheme, Carmen, Elisir d'Amor, La Traviata, Rigoletto etc. No Wagner stuff. Texts are in original language with translations."
5,FANTASTIC Collection COMPLETE!,Of all the Video Collections from the Music world this is the most complete and utterly entertaining. This collection includes everything! It took me back to my high school days when I first saw the video for How Will I Know and brought me right up to 2000. Wildly entertaining I LOVED IT!
1,Not Pleased,"I am very dissatisfied, I could not get this CD to play on any player in my home.It appears to me that this CD was burnt. I'm sure this seller made a one time killing on this product, however. I would never do business with this person again."
4,about Whitney Houston - greatest hits..........,"The music collection is nice but the sound of it...hmmm.....'do badly"".........:-)Written by:Dr, Prof (PhD) Ang Poon KahTC submission for 'this'/money government.Imagine entertainment for Da Vinci Code.DNA production for notes on a scandal...all can just have it....Syncast for Mystery of the Nile.Director for upcoming film harry Potter - order of the phoenix, all can just have it.Zakkers film director."
5,A rich DVD,"I received this DVD as a Christmas present and let me tell you, it is excellent. There are so many videos that Whitney has made over the years as an artist. And when you first view the DVD, there's a short intro made by Whitney herself, as well as a fun and interactive menu of what you want to watch. I enjoyed the interviews of Whitney and Clive Davis. One thing that made me laugh is seeing all of her old videos that she made in the 80's. It's amazing to see how much the style of pop music has changed. To sum up, this DVD is rich with Whitney material that won't put you down at all."
5,Greatest,"Everyone who loves Whitney should have this DVD, and if you don't love her you still should have it.Its great, the interviews are great and the videos are super.She is my greatest female singer of all times, and I am looking forward to the new album she's working on."
3,Where are the duet videos?,"""If I Told You That"" (with George Michael)""Same Script Different Cast"" (with Deborah Cox)""When You Believe"" (with Mariah Carey)They all had videos and they all were great duets. You don't get to see two superstars together very often (Deborah Cox hasn't become a superstar but she deserves to be one)"
1,Should have looked more carefully.,"The tragic loss of Whitney caused me to go on line and quickly order as much of her music as I could in one album. In my hurry I missed that this was a remix, not just a remix but a horrible remix. All those gorgeous iconic songs were drowned out by a mind numbing beat and synthesized overshadowing of her beautiful voice. Save your money and spend the time looking for the original sounds. If updating means destroying, they succeeded."
5,most greatest recopilation of the Whitney Houston's top songs,Whitney Houston - Greatest Hitsevery hits that you have listened of collection of Whitney are included in this magnific DVD. Beutiful videos shows her excellent perfomance.
1,Useless warranty and useless product,"Bottom blade broke after about 10 uses. No, I did not try to cut a fence. Called Wrox customer service (mis-nomer, should be non-service). First they told me they could send me a new blade, then they told me management would have to ok and they would call me back within 24 hours. They did not call back. So, I called again, they tried to sell me the blade for about $30.00 with shipping, when I asked about warranty, the person at Wrox customer non-service said Amazon would cover the warranty, since I bought from Amazon. This is BS. So, the hedgetrimmers are in the trash, I will never buy another Wrox product and I advise you to be very careful if you are considering buying this one."
5,How to make everyday a terrific day,If you are looking for a motivational DVD for employees or students this is the one Ed Forman is incredible.
3,Mai fan review,"The other review is really detailed so i probably wont get too detailed. ok for the first one its mako vs. yugi it is kind of a difficult battle but yugi wins next episode mokuba (Kaiba's little brother) Plans to defeat yugi in a duel before pegasus does because if pegasus does ownership to kaiba corp will be his! The final episode At least im pretty sure it might be different for dvd Anyways Yugi has to face kaiba's ghost or so they think but if your buying this dvd you might as well by vol. 4 ""give up the ghost"" because this ends at a to be continued but over all i think they are ok episodes."
1,"This book is for statisticians, not general users.","This book has more equations than words -- it is of no use if you want practical advice on statistical analysis of data. This is a stats book for statisticians, not for scientists in general.Another problem -- the index is very short and incomplete.(I should note that I do use multivariate stats in my work and have had course work on the subject -- I still found this book hard to understand)."
3,Non Fiction,"Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysisby Richard A. Johnson is your basic beyond basic if you will, garden variety big honking textbook deal.A somewhat useful tome, but again, not that particularly interesting or great otherwise, other than being a text. These things can certainly be done better."
3,Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis,"This is the textbook used in a graduate statistical analysis math course. Statistical methods presented use a great deal of math and applications are often obscured by the mathematics. This is a good book for the reader interested into understanding applied statistical math; however, if the reader's interest isin applying statistical concepts to practical problems; he/she need to look at other books."
3,brilliant prose rescues overcooked story...,"Ian McEwan certainly writes wonderful prose. When matched with a fine story, as with Atonement, one can easily say he is one of the best novelists around. Unfortunately in Black Dogs the author chose to stretch what should have been a short story into a short novel, leading to barely passable results.Black Dogs is based on the confrontation between a pair of wild dogs and a young woman, and its aftermath, shortly after WW II. Beyond this rather frightening episode, with the fear factor captured beautifully by McEwan, we are led into a rather silly mish-mash of mysticism - eg, were these dogs some supernatural entities meant to represent something other than nasty canines? Not being a particularly mystical person myself, I found all this to be a bunch of nonsense stretched to tedious proportions by the author.Bottom line: generally a pleasurable read but McEwan has written much, much better."
3,I am mystified,"The good news about this book is also the bad news. From the beginning it suggests a cataclysmic event and throughout, just as my interest flags, he offers an intriguing fact that keeps you interested. But when I got to the end, I could only ask Why. Why did he think these very dry people were interesting, they weren't. Ultimately, I felt it was more of a tease than anything. I also felt like the writer had been living in a bubble if he thought his character's story was interesting, let alone compelling. I gave it three stars because I liked the writing and loved the French countryside venues."
3,Slow action,Did not hold my attention.It started to bore me I gave up.did give it a real go but failed to finish.
3,Different from the VH-1 edit,"My four kids (between ages 11 and 4)taped Weird Al's concert on VH-1. They watched it constantly until the tape began to wear out. So I ordered a copy from Amazon.com. I knew there would be stuff that VH-1 had edited out but I was surprised to find out that some of it was not suitable for the younger children, especially ""The Night Santa Went Crazy."" I'm not knocking Weird Al, but I thought other parents might want to be aware of this."
5,Very Funny,This dvd and the video collection are my kids two favorite music dvd's. Both of them are worth having.
4,Cardio Overdrive,Good workout gets you sweaty. It took 2 or 3 times going thru to get the routines down. Like it a lot.
5,I write for a teen magazine and I see a lot of books...,"but this is one of the best advice books to come across my desk. Jill helps me with my advice column in ym, Ask Anything, and, like this book, her ideas are always clear, succinct, non-condescending, and creative. It's very hard to find something new to say about typical teenage dilemmas like talking to parents who won't let you date, but Jill manages to have fresh takes on all of the problems she addresses. I'd definitely recommend this for any teenager who finds herself stressed and confused by the ins and outs of life."
2,"Perspective, people","The Supremes were great. The Temptations were great. This review is not a knock on either of them. Together, they recorded a handful of decent tracks. But this 2-disc package, though reasonably priced, is a needlessly padded expansion of two not-very-good albums. If you don't have at least a good hits compilation of each of these legendary acts, don't start with this. Each album (which represents the bulk of it's respective disc) has loads of filler (some of it bland, MOR stuff). Of the bonus tracks, many of them (the majority on disc two, in fact) are simply alternate mixes of album tracks that will thrill only the hardcore.Most of these recordings are far from terrible, and some are very good. But it's not as good as you might expect if you are a fan of these two groups and Motown in general."
5,Very informative! If only it were fiction,"Ann Jones is passionate about her views on domestic violence. If there is any issue that needs passionate advocates it's this one. I found this book very informative, full of case examples and important information on how our justice system doesn't currently work very well to protect battered women or prosecute violent men. Concerned Americans need the information provided in this book so that we can work together to make the changes necessary in our society to put a stop to this horrendous epidemic. However, a word of caution to potential readers; this book contains so many horror stories, it is difficult to cope with. This can cause perfectly logical people to feel overwhelmed, and even be overtaken by denial, simply because it can be to much for the heart to bear. Well researched and well written, a great resource for anyone working in the law enforcement, medical, or human services fields. -Sharice Lee, Author: The Survivor's Guide-"
5,Great reading for anybody interested in leadership,"Anyone interested in learning about leadership should go back to the classics. Clearly has done a great job putting together a collection of the most influencial eastern classics in three volumes. The five classics included in this volume present crucial aspects of human development and empowerment. The most insighful readings in my opinion are thunder in the Sky and The Book of the Five Rings. The first one talks about the skills and behavior of succesful leaders, while the second one deals with the art of confrontation and victory. Clearly's comments are very good in providing insights about the reading. My last recommendation is to start with the first volume: The Art of War by Sun Tzu."
1,Designed by someone who doesn't sleep?,"The problems I have with this unit are numerous:1) The display is backlit *only* when you press the face of the unit. Which means you can't tell what time it is at night unless you reach over and push the face.2) The phyiscal orientation of the unit determines which alarm you hear, but the controls to turn off the alarm are only on one side. You will have to pick up the unit, turn it around, hunt down the little alarm on/off button, and put it back down on the side you want. No thanks.3) The sleep function only sounds the alarm three times. Once you've snoozed the third time, the alarm won't sound again until the next morning. A great way to miss work :(Yes, it looks cool; yes, the alarms are very nice and will wake even a sound sleeper. But if any of the negatives above sound annoying to you, you'll probably find this unusable."
4,i can wake up,"its loud,lovely shape and cheap price.i wish that the backlight was brighter and the control keys were in front or any position with better accessability..like this i will give 5 stars for this product."
2,Hard to open flaps.,The flaps in this book stick and are nearly impossible for little fingers to open. The pictures are just average.
4,This is a scream!,I am not really interested in video games. I leave that entertainment to my kids but the arcade games in this game are hysterical! Imagine racing your car at top speed down the ramp and then launching the driver in to the air to score a basket in basketball or a goal in soccer. We all just laugh as the guy flies through the air. It sounds morbid but the oversized arenas (imagine a dart board the size of the drive-in movie screen) and funny sound effects are really funny. Everyone we have played with has headed out to get their own copy! It's really fun!
1,did not work!!!,"game does not work, got ripped off. do not buy from them. game was from blockbuster so it was stolen anyway."
4,"Very Difficult, but not impossible","First off, id like to say that this is one of the best if not best ninja games out there. If you like to jump around throwing shurikens and cutting guys heads off, this is the game for you. Many people complain about the difficulty, and i must admit that beating it in Normal (The easiest difficulty) was quite a challenge. I did have to reset A LOT of times to save up my precious Scroll of Reincarnation, and would fight each boss around 5 times so i can find its weakness, and beat it using the least potions possible. One has to be careful about using their potions since buying them is a waste of money. Even though it is frustratign at times, the satisfaction of beating a boss with only one potion is priceless and the feeling one gets after beatign the game (final boss wasnt too hard since i had 3 scrolls of reincarnation) is also priceless. So i would highly reccomend this game to anyone of age 14+ because little kids just dont have the patious us older guys do."
5,I DAY NEVER WITHOUT,"I don't really own an XBOX, but my cousin owns one and he just got this game. The graphics are ****** crazy! I played this game once and it got my adrenaline pumping at a gaggilion miles per hour. The gut splattering fun is NASTY, and the enemies are RIDICUOUSLY HARD! MY HANDS WERE GLUED TO THE EXTREMELY LARGE XBOX CONTROLLERS! Take this game for a joyride and get SCREW-BENDED! Seriously get this incredible game."
2,Devil may Cry: attack of the clones,"The game is a simple updated imitacion of capcom's Devil may cry, shame o you ninka team. The game is great but at that price you can get something better (prince of persia to start), buy it if you are a die hard fan, and i will say it again. Shame of you Tam ninja"
5,WHEN WILL THE PRICE DROP,"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, WHEN WILL THE PRICE GO DOWN>...... IF YOU DONT THINK THIS GAME IS AWESOME, JUST LOOK AT THE OTHER REVIEWS!!!"
2,the hardest game ever made,"this game has little fun factor to it. if you want a game that raises your blood pressure to unhealthy levels during each chapter, to the point where you want to trade it in everytime you play it, then this is the game for you. if you're looking for a game that is fun, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. as much as i love being a ninja and chopping enemies to bits, it is not worth the hours spent trying to advance 50 yards in the game. the average grunt soldiers can at times give you a run for your money. not to mention bosses. weapon power ups are only possible if you spend hours doing repetative killing with no advancement in the game. i thought i could tough it out but only made it a little past half way before i decided to trade this game in for probably half of what i put in to it. rent it dont buy it."
5,Team Ninja does it again,Dead or Alive and now this. What a game. My hopes of this game was what I got. Buy this game or throw your xbox in the trash.
1,ONE BIG SHAM!!,"I wish I would have taken the poor reviews seriously before I ordered this book! I am doing research on the Lilith Fair and was desperate for information. However, I could have got the same information off of the net with out having to read about the authors little ""cowinkidinks"" that have been thrown in over and over (and over) again throughout this entire book. Fitzgerald (or Fitz, as the people who know her in the book, and lovingly refer to her as, once they discover what a great gal and a great ""reporter"" she is) writes in such an irritating and ""cutzie"" way that this book makes for one HUGE annoying experence. The only conspiracy going on is all the five star reviews this book is getting!! Save yourself some time and money - Do not buy this book!"
1,Bashing a reviewer,"Okay, I believe that you had no right to bash anyone that wrote a review disliking this book. Yes, you have a right to your opinion, but you have NO RIGHT to tell people that they're stupid/stalkers because they disliked this book. People have made valid points as to their feelings about this book. It's just an opinion. Maybe, on your next review you should stick to your critique on the book and not the people who critiqued the book. Hey, thats just an idea. I am personally offended and hurt by your personal remarks towards me and other reviewers. Who's sorry now? You should be."
1,"If you want to read about Sarah, don't buy this book.","I really don't care how much judith fitzgerald thinks she knows about the music ""biz."" And I really got tired of her trying to impress the readers with her vocabulary. If I wanted to read about her, I would have bought her own autobiography (please tell me there isn't one.)No...I wanted to read about Sarah. That's why I bought the book in the first place. It was a mistake."
1,Horribly written.,"First of all, this book is horribly written. A lot of it makes no sense; plus, the punctuation and grammar are disgraceful (if you need examples, just open the book to any page). This thing could not possibly have been copy-edited or proofread very closely--Sarah's last name is even spelled incorrectly on the spine! Second, the book is just a nasty unauthorized bio. The author engages in some ethically questionable methods to get her ""information,"" and implies some outrageous things. Even if you're not a Sarah fan, you'll probably sympathize with her after reading this hatchet job. It must be tough having people write things like this about you. Please, please, don't waste your precious time and money on this debacle of a book."
1,Tries too hard to be cool,"This is one of the worst books ever made and it was made just so they could turn a quick buck with the name of a rising star. I wonder what the author was thinking when she wrote this pile of crap. The book tries too hard be slick and cool, but it ultimately goes nowhere and it takes awhile to get there."
1,How to make money at the expense of others...,"Building A Mystery: The Story of Sarah McLachlan and Lilith Fair, Judith Fitzgerald's pathetic first foray into the world of the unauthorised biography, might easily have been titled: ""How to Make Money at the Expense of Others"". This is simply another trashy tell-all that abounds in sale bins at your local bookstore. Fitzgerald makes Sarah out to be some evil beast of a woman who kills anyone who gets in her way. It's pointless to read a book that was only written asa vehicle to strike back at Sarah and her management for whatever imagined slights Judith Fitzgerald feels they've perpetrated against her."
1,not recommended,"Regarding this biography by Judith Fitzgerald, I don't know about anyone else, but the book completely made me ill. I think Fitz has some kind of personal vendetta agianst sarah and Nettwerk. I mean, a whole chapter on Uwe Vandrei, and a memoriam credit to him in the beginning. What's up with that?? I totally agree with the other reviews. The book was so awful. Not only that, but it was BORING. I had a really hard time staying awake reading it. This book is completely annoying and is was not authorized by Sarah orNettwerk so keep that in mind."
4,Pretty Decent!,"O-K, so I didn't think it would be very good after reading some of these nasty reviews which makes Sarah look like her fans are psycos but, it's a pretty decent job. Sometimes I didn't understand what the author meant but, over all, it's pretty decent. Any fan of Sarahs should have a copy anyways because its pretty good on her growing up and where she went to school and all that too, not just when she becomes famous."
1,MISINFORMATION!!!,"I did not know I was purchasing a fiction book, Really now -- a huge chapter dedicated to Uwe - the obsessed fan -- and a few pages about the Lilith fair? This book is just to far-fetched to even belive. Do not buy it. It is a waist of money."
1,"Sad, really...","It's sad, really, that someone capable of much finer work than this would choose to publish a half-hearted tell all such as this book. The character development is slow and shallow, merely re-contextured quotes that don't give any real sense of the true Sarah McLachlan.Little is mentioned, if at all, about the other half of the title, Lilith Fair. A small chapter, heavily burdened with the displeasure Fitzgerald felt at not being given free entry to the venue or backstage access the object of her prose.Don't mistake this book for what it isn't. It's not a biography. It's a specious retelling of the same old story through the eyes of its author. It also happens not to be very entertaining, or interesting."
1,Trashy...,"This book is pretty bad. Why spend good money on it? It's not well written, and it's boring.Save your hard earned bucks, and use them to buy a Sarah McLachlan cd instead. That'll tell all you need to know about Sarah McLachlan."
1,Poorly written...,"What strikes me most is how poorly written this book is. It gives you the impression that the author knew Lilith Fair was going to be big news, so she decided to cash in on it by writing a book in a few weeks time. She interviews Uwe Vandrei's sister at length, and goes as far as hinting at a conspiracy (Nettwerk involved?) surrounding his suicide. And if you didn't like the cover picture, that's a good indication that the author is not going to paint the best picture of Sarah in the book. In many ways, she praises Sarah as a singer and musician; but it is pretty clear that she dislikes Terry McBride and some of the people at Nettwerk (maybe she has good reason to, maybe not). I think that Rolling Stone did more of a number on Sarah that this author does, simply because nobody of importance to Sarah (except her birth mother) would give her thetime of day - that's why the book is full of past soundbites from Sarah and why the book really doesn't bring out anything of new interest."
3,ok,"The book is from the prospective of people around sarah mclachlan, this is an unauthorized biography. It is more like a recap of every interview sarah mclachlan ever had in her life."
4,great starter books,My kids love the illustrations and the stories are easy and fun for them to read.
1,Fake show not worth your time....PLEASE READ!,"Produced and over-acted purely for ratings, Paranormal State is one of the many reasons the field of paranormal studies will never get the credibility it deserves. Funny how much 'ground breaking' evidence just happens to show up when the cameras are running. They should admid to the public that this is an obvious sham and let the real investigators do their job. Most Haunted opened the door for theatrics and fakery and Paranormal State blatently walked through. Jerry Springer would be proud as his audience now has even more bad acting and low budget directing to follow. Buy this and spit in the face of all that's scientific and genuine in the field of paranormal research. It's a shame that they set the field back 100 years for a paycheck. A&E; should be embarassed!AWFUL! AWFUL! AWFUL!"
1,Absolutely Ridiculous With Little Attempt To Hide It,"I've watched this show a few times just due to the ""train wreck"" effect. A bunch of college kids with some video cameras and other ridiculous instrumentation trying SO hard to convince the audience and themselves that something paranormal is going on. They never come up with anything that could remotely be considered as plausible evidence, just a bunch of suggestions, and speculation that they don't even bother to dignify with additional research.I caught a couple recent shows and now they've added this other fraud, Chip Coffey, a ""medium"" who in BOTH shows I watched, happened to have something ""move"" unexpectedly near him. Both times it was obvious that it would have been easy for him to move the item himself, and his acting was so bad that it convinced me that was the case.The greatest achievement here is that these kids are getting paid to put this crap on the air."
5,Cute and soft!,"My daughter can't sleep without it! It's so cute and soft. It's not that big, perfect for a newborn or infant baby. I got it at a great price through Amazon."
4,Good but...,"I started listening to DCT since like 12 years ago - I love the group, esp. Miwa's voice. I was a bit disappointed though, to find that all songs on this CD were sung in English... she sounds WAY better in her native tongue."
5,Living Vatican II in the Day to Day,"The author of this book has created a collection of short personal stories that introduce and brilliantly exemplify explanations of the main focal points of two of the key Vatican II documents. In the best Catholic ""both-and"" tradition Doyle manages to thoroughly present most aspects of the issues associated with the documents, offering his skillful synthesis to the reader to then consider and digest. The book is a wonderful read, ideal for both everday ""Catholics in the pews"" and undergraduate students who wish to learn more about their great Vatican II heritage. Overall, a masterful work."
1,Life After People- Blue Ray,This was total CRAP! After being assured it was high quality blue ray material it did not work on my blue ray player as it apparently not made for Australian blue ray players. Thus i have a whole tv series i cannot watch.
3,very good but national geographic film is better,"Very good, but not as thorough as the National Geographic version - Aftermath: Population Zero. For those who are detail-oriented, you're better off with the National Geographic one."
3,A brief comment,"Although I enjoyed the visual presentation and the special effects, compared to the book, this is more eye-candy than anything really substantial about how our civilization might end. I would have preferred a bit more detail and in-depth analysis to the presentation, but what the heck, it's intended for the general public and you can't get too scientific, otherwise the viewing public will switch from your channel to something else that requires less of an attention span, and no one will see the sponsor's all-important commercials. It's fine for something entertaining but not too demanding to watch on a lazy night, but don't expect much more than that. If you're really interested in the subject I'd just get the book instead."
2,Gets more and more boring,"The first few moments of the video were okay, it was a blend of computer generated effects and scientific predictions about what would happen if there were no people left on earth to maintain and live in buildings, parks, cities etc. After awhile, it just gets kind of tedious to watch and sit through."
1,these suck do not buy!,very small and as soon as anything gets in there they stop draining water through because they are so small
2,Neither fit my washtub,"These are sturdy and shiny and should last for a long time. My problem is that neither one fits my utility tub well. One is too large for the drain hole. The other fits better, but the lip sits high enough that the tub doesn't drain. Disappointing."
4,So Far So Good!,"I have only had the battery for two weeks. I arrived on time and was as described. Charged it overnight and installed in a hard starting pickup the next day. Have the power to start it and worked fine. The only worry is that except for Sears there is no place that carrys it, if I do have a problem."
4,Excellent for iPod Video,"I bought this dock specifically for the S-video connection because I wanted to be able to watch my iPod's mpeg movies on my Sony LCD TV. S-video is, of course, a little better than your standard RCA connection. Hook up was easy and the picture quality totally exceeded my expectations. I have a 26 inch LCD TV and the movies looked about as good as a DVD. I ran a Monster AV cable from the line out connection on the dock to my Onkyo TX-SR604 receiver and then ran the S-video cable from the dock to the receiver as well. Sound and picture were great. The other good thing about this dock is that I was able to keep the skin on my iPod and still have it fit in the dock. If you are wanting on screen menus this is not the dock for you, but if you want good picture and sound quality you can't go wrong with this gadget. Remember to change your TV setting to ""on"" in the iPod's video settings!"
2,Awesome Country,Lane Turner is awesome. He reminds me of early George Strait. He is sure to be the next big country star.
5,Really got me thinking about what I could do with my life,"""The Why Café"" was a quick read with a deep message. As soon as the book asked me the question ""Why am I here"", I had something bubbling inside me that told me this was going to be a special book. I loved the connection the author made between living a life you love (living your ""Purpose for Existing"") and reducing your need and desire for things and money. This book starts in a motion a new train of a thought about life and why we're here. It's smart, it's simple, and it's a pleasure to read. Get a few friends to read it and spend a night talking about your Purpose for Existing. That'll be a night you won't forget."
1,for the money ....,"I can't help noticing that, for $75, we could simply install a new hard drive (and a larger one at that). My Xbox isn't modded, it's just getting to b e v e r y s l o o o o w loading/saving game etc (even froze on autosave recently), and $75 seems pretty darn high for a simple reformat. Obviously this is more gripe than product review, but seems like it needs to be said. - unless, of course, Microsoft *wants* us to get our Xboxes modded (to void warranties?), in which case exorbitant prices are just right."
4,Armor for your ds,I have to say this is the best protective product for your ds on the market. The pouch/bag is way too bulky; the silicon tube doesn't stay on tight enough; and the adhesive filter peels off after some time. But this plastic shell does its job of protecting the outside of your ds while perfectly maintaining its stylish sheen. The only thing I have to complain is that the clasp on the edge of the screen prevents the ds from fully closing up. The widest gap is about 2mm.
4,Use the free spools program,"Sorry Amazon, I love you, but $7 for two spools is crazy when you can get six spools for $6 from the manufacturer. The item itself is fine, but the price here is not."
4,Really nice,"I really like this cd compared to most of the run of the mill Native american flute music that is out there...this is much more varied, and not nearly as boring as listening to a full album of flute music, ...I mean I like meatloaf, but not every night. good music, well done, glad I got it."
5,This music makes it so everyone can relate to the Native Am,I have been impressed with the music since I have heard it on a Pure Moods CD. The music from Sacred Spirits has a little of everything in it and seems like everyone could and would enjoy listening to if given the chanec to hear it. I'm surprised that more of this music isn't heard on raido stations because of the up beat toans and the calming and relaxing chants. I feel it erasses the depiction of American Indians just beatting on drums and howling. There is a real beauity in this music to where you can envision the music in your head.
4,Haunting sounds of a bygone age,"Pleased with purchase some of the tracks are great, a few not so much, but well worth the purchase for the few"
2,total screw up,"if I had wanted to listen to crap electronic music I would have gone elsewhere. TOTAL dissappointment, authentic singing ruined by REALLY bad taste electronics, it went straight in the trash can in disgust. Keep looking, for the real thing. I am.Sacred Spirit: Chants and Dances of the Native Americans"
3,Nice but use your imagination,"The music is nice, but a fusion of Western and Natvie American.I am Native American. Most music is traditional, yet the fusion, in many cases requires a beyond the spiritual imagination. Imagine Crazy Horse doing the ""Robot"", and you will get some idea of the degree of fusion in this music.(nu-da e-lo e-lo-hi ga-nv-go-i a-ge-a-di-s-di)"
5,Teaches through example.,"Gail's book doesn't just talk about the feelings and thoughts that we experience during major life transitions; she puts sidebars with very specific prescriptive recommendations on what you can do. I think that's what sets this book apart from many that explore inner struggle. The book is 1/3 deep, personal diary; 1/3 ""this is how it made me feel""; and 1/3 ""if you felt this too, then do A, B, and C to get through it.""I am impressed with the author's candid, vulnerable, and honest exploration of her own struggles and willingness to expose her own weak moments to others, so that they can learn from them. Only a strong, self-assured person can use their own dark moments as a teaching tool for others. I think Gail has done it well."
5,BEST SHOOTER SINCE HALO!!!,"This game is DEFINITELY the best third-person shooter ever, and probably should be considered one of the best shooters ever. The bad thing is this game may not sell much, due to a lack of publicity, but if you read this, I suggest you buy this game. Overall, the only bad thing in this game is some pretty annoying/hard levels. But its got the best multiplayer levels ever, and the perfect length for campaign mode.Overall: 12/10!"
2,"pretty, but flimsy","I love caps & thought this beautiful color newsboy would work, but material lacked body."
3,"Great item, poor packaging for shipping","Love the crayons, but the packaging was so poor that several of the crayons arrived broken. My son was really disappointed when he opened the box and lots of crayon pieces fell out. I would buy the item again, but not from Amazon."
3,Not what I expected,"Maybe I haven't owned these sheets long enough (it sounds as if they get better over time), but I was a little disappointed. For 500 thread count, they felt similar to my 200 bed-in-a-bag set. They have a slightly papery texture, even after a couple washings. I do love the color, so i guess I'll keep throwing them in the wash and cross my fingers."
1,Boring the whole way through,"This Indiana Jones book is the first one that I bought, thinking that a book about Indiana Jones and Noah's Ark would be a great story, but to my disapointment it was boring! It took 252 pages to even get to Mount Ararat! It took a long time to get going, and when action got going it was gone just as soon as it had begun. Not the kind of story I would expect from Indiana jones. In all of his movies Indy is finding clues and making sense of them, but in this book there are none of it. Dont get this book if you like the movies, you will be disapointed."
5,"Great Slip, Great Price","Great slip. Fits well, it is true to size, and it doesn't ride up, as promised. I will buy more of these in different colors. And buy a couple to cut off and make into camisoles."
4,A good story,"I really liked the story, but I am unsure why I did. The characters are likable and the plotting is good (but not great...I have a large anime collection, so there are some truly great films that I have viewed). This is a PG-13 film with no frontal nudity. The story is not juvenile and is essentially a nice fantasy genre tale...it is, again, enjoyable and well worth the cost."
2,Forgery,"Be warned that some of this book both in text and drawings is a modern-day forgery by the modern translator. This statement has been proven by various European scholars. Liwwaet Boeke did not write the essay talking about sex, for example. BEWARE!"
4,Bought to make bath bombs,"I was looking for citric acid to make bath fizzy bombs. This was a good price for the amount you get. You can buy it in bulk elsewhere for a cheaper price, but this was all I needed at the time. The company shipped it super fast!"
3,Five Points,Any history buff would love to learn of New York's 'Five Points' and all that went with it.
1,Don't waste your money,"I began using this product at 8 weeks when I didn't have stretch marks yet. Then I developed red stretch marks around my belly throughout my pregnancy. Unfortunately, at 4 months along, we lost our baby. It's been almost 6 months and I still have stretch marks and they have gotten worse. However, the stretch marks didn't get worse because of the lotion. I read in an article that stretch marks are due to the hormones in your body and lotions typically do not work.I applied the lotion as directed and there are no changes at all. The lotion is sticky and does stick to your clothes. I've been using the product everyday for 8 months and there have been no changes! The only reason I'm using it is because I paid $40 for a tube of lotion.I do not recommend this lotion to anyone."
1,Couldn't hook it up,"I tried it on two television sets and tried all recommended available hookups--and I have been doing this kind of connection since the 1970s. But I couldn't get the setup to start. When I finally located the producer in Taiwan,whose only advice was to get another one from the seller, who said they weren't producing it any longer. End of story. But I had read a review which concluded that it was the best in its price category."
2,trombone slide oil,"I am a long-time player of trombone. This oil is very good, but I've been working with a different one which in my case seems better for my ""tight"" Bach trombone slide. I feel that for a tight slide like in the Bach, one needs extra smooth lubrication. But, the sale of the this Holton oil was handled very nicely.Chuck"
5,Espectacular portatil,"Este es es un producto asombroso, es un computador que ademas de ser un diseno precisoso, tiene muchas caracteristicas que yo buscaba en un cmputador portatil, como suficiente memoria ram, disco duro de gran capacidad, control remoto para la opciones multimedia, sencillamente lo que yo andaba buscando, ademas su tamano de 14,1"" que para mi es ideal."
5,12 Volt Orbital Battery,"I've been aware of the orbital automotive batteries for over 20 years.I've always used them when ever possible. They are rather expensive but well worth it.The items that normaly go wrong with a car is tires batteries, and oil changes.It's is great to know that one of those items can be taken care of without much thought, under normal conditions.thats installing a orbital battery. I've used Optima till recently,they have changed their warrenty so I have tried the EXIDE ORBITAL for the frist time.The past reviews on this battery are as great as the Optima reviews ever were.I think the warrenty today is better.I bought two of them.Now if they could just make oil and tires last as long. Thanks ceoci1Auto Repair For Dummies"
2,"Image shows (2) bulbs, some reviews said (1) bulb?","Image shows (2) bulbs, some reviews said (1) bulb? Which one is it.I would like to buy it but no sure what I would be purchasing a (2) bulb or (1) bulb light? So for now I will hold off til I know the for sure."
4,good.,"This light produces nice fluorescent light. Body feels a little cheap but that doesn't take away from the performance, just preference. However, I recommend."
2,Reconsider buying this for campers,"The sleeping bag is extremely warm, no matter the temperature (it should hold few degrees below zero cel).However, the zipper box ( the little square at the end of the feet side on the zipper ) somehow fell off or broke off within only months of purchasing. And I only took it to camping one time. This happened while I was sleeping in my own bed.Therefore, I am very disappointed in having spent 30 something bucks on this product, and do not advise you to take that risk, especially if you camp often."
3,Not as good as her later books,"I got the third book (She Came By The Book) as a gift in '98 and spent the next three years hunting down the rest. I finally got my hands on this one and, sadly, I'm dissapointed. Maybe it's becuase I know how things end up, but I was expected a set up book to lead me from 'She Came Too Late' neatly into 'She Came By The Book'. All I got were more questions and confusion. Not enough character development and too many plot holes. In the end, I had to tell myself there was a mysterious 'missing' book that would explain all my confusion away. Read as a part of the series, it'll only perplex you. Read as a single story, it's pertty good. The mystery holds togeather enough that I kept turning the pages, but I could have done without the (poorly explained) imprisonment.Mary Wings does get better, and I'd suggest skipping this one and going straight to 'She Came By The Book'."
5,Sterling Silver Chain,I bought this to wear with a big silver locket that has an antique look and needed a heavy looking chain. This one is very pretty and it shipped to me super fast. I would buy it again!
1,Chain 2mm sterling silver chian,Not good not what I want so do not get in touch with me less I get in touch or make right
5,Very solid product.,"The baskets comes in a nicely packed box. Each of the basket comes in good shape, solid made, high quality. I would recommend it to my friends."
5,Good Quality,I bought these to store magazines. They are very nice looking and of good quality. I would buy them again.
5,A great book!,"I'm a teenage girl who loves to read Everything!! Summer 1990 was unique and totally up-to-date. The author is from Kuwait, which is also a first. Besides telling the story of the Gulf War, it also has an exciting plot and events. Once you start reading it, you can't put it down. It's a real page turner."
3,this product is unacceptable.,"I was very pleased at first, but being a collector I was very eager to open it. I did, and I was kindof bummed. the original owner must have painted cutter's gold arm band green, and given his sin on his chest a new coat fo paint. you could have really told the difference in the paint/skin color. nightrunner was really, really sticky, the original owner must have re-glued his head back on, and put a coat of god knows what all over his body. The condition of cutters hands and joints (Elbows, legs, wrists, etc.) were in an ok shape, his wrists were not acceptable. I wanted to put him in a pose but, due to the condition of his wrists, I could not. and the white ""Tendril"" things on his vest, were also poorly glued on. Although, I do like it, I was really, really mad and I wasted 65 dollars on this. kind of and kind of not worth my money."
5,Gatlin's best writting,"Larry Wayne has written the best songs of his career, each song is an inspiration and truley from God. ""In My Life"" is every christians prayer. Larry has done a great job, each song is different and appealing to a wide range of people with varying taste in music."
4,Buster Cube Review,My dog hasn't quite taken to this toy but she does't really play with any toy.I hope to use this more on future puppies.
3,For Carpet Only,"Although this product is good for keeping our dog busy, the cube shape and hard plastic make it impractical to use on any non-carpeted surface. The cube is incredibly noisy on our hardwood floors, and it slides so much that our dog can barely turn it over. Moreover, we are worried about it scratching the floor or our furniture. A spherical toy with the same concept (lots of internal compartments for treat dispensing) would have been better for us."
2,Buster Cube - Great for 5 Minutes,"Buster Cube - Large - 4 1/2 in.We were excited to get this for our German Shepherd Dog, because we wanted something that would keep him occupied while we were gone. Based on the reviews we'd read, we thought it would be a good idea. It was, at first. Our dog had a great time tossing it around, trying to get the treats out of it. However, not more than a few hours after we gave it to him, he was poking holes in it with his teeth. He'd completely destroyed in within two days.It would be perfect if the material was a bit stronger for those aggressive chewers and larger dogs like German Shepherds!"
3,Buster Food Cube,"This looks like a really great training toy for your dog when you watch the video, but it is very difficult for the dog to push/turn it over because of its cube shape, and therefore the treat/food isn't dispensed quickly even on the easiest setting. We've found that a more spherical shape with an opening at two ends is more appealing to our dog because the reward is almost immediate (A.D.D. dog I suppose).We will continue to encourage our dog to learn this toy, and maybe it will become more productive..."
4,Dog is crazy for it,"My yellow labrador loves the busters food cube! I only have one complaint I cant take out the middle to clean it. If you are unhappy with food cube try the ""kibble nibble"""
2,Doesn't stick to sink,"I had high hopes for this 'sink center', but we have a stainless sink and one of the suction cups doesn't stick. It is a huge disappointment."
4,"Works well, nice size","This product is well made and works well for getting clutter off the counter. There is room for a regular size sponge plus a little extra room that I use for a nail brush & plastic scraper. I have removed it twice to clean underneath and both times have had to moisten it a second time and press very hard so that it stays attached to my stainless steel sink. Had it not been for that, I would have given it 5 stars! Would recommend."
2,It doesn't stick,"The point of this tool is supposed to be that it sticks and stays stuck to the side of the sink. It sticks, initially, but doesn't stay stuck, except to the bottom of the sink after it falls there. Frustrating."
4,Cute impulse purchase for me,"Okay, my honest feelings now that I have this item is that it's a little bit goofy, but nice nevertheless! The suction cups are not as strong as one would hope - when will they invent a really tough suction cup??? But it works well and is a nice size. I don't have an especially deep sink and I thought if I got one of these, it would encourage us to be better about keeping the shallow sink bowl cleaned out, but that's our problem - not the problem of the product! I do like this and so far it's holding up well to our abuse.Is it going to revolutionize your life? No. Is it cute and kind of convenient? yes. And I hate the dreaded sink top clutter so it suits me."
5,Get Wig!,I actually liked this version better than both the original cast recording and the movie soundtrack.The slight raw edge and variances in song-rendition provide for a richer listening experience.These performers are totally enjoying their own performance.Worth every penny.
2,"French Fortresses in North America 1535-1763: ""Québec, Montréal, Louisbourg and New Orleans""","Title a bit misleading..........When i saw the title of this book I instantly jumped for it, being a fan of french military history in the north america, especially since the title includes fortress of new orleans. Sad to say there were only six pages devoted to new orleans, with no intricate, detailed illustrations that accompanied Louisbourg, Montreal and Quebec. If you are interested in the canadian fortresses, by all means buy this title, but if you are interested in the fortifications of new orleans and louisiana, look on wikipedia instead, you will find much more detailed info."
3,too basic,"A brightly coloured and well laid out book, Great on the info for dates, times and elements but thin on the info about each sign. A good first book intot his subject but for more details about each sign and combination there are better books"
3,ehh,to find where a signal is coming from and if it is moved then you have to move it again is jus dumb. I prefer omni directional from trendnet. but it seems of nice quality
4,IF A BUS COULD TALK,"The book If A Bus Could Talk is a great book for preschoolers. The pictures are full of color, and they are very clear for 3 year olds to retell the stroy by."
4,Annulment Primmer,"This is an excellent basic intorduction to the questions about the annulment process of the Roman Catholic Church. It touches all the bases in simple straight forward language. I think it should be read before reading any other material on the subject, some of which are a might too technical for the layperson."
3,Not TOO Horrible...but,"I think we've owned this for about 4-5 years now and it still vacuums fine. I haven't had to replace any broken parts or anything, and its still doing its job. My only problem is, I'm tired of cleaning the filters. Whenever I finish vacuuming, I have to first empty the canister, then unscrew one filter from the canister and beat all the dust out of it (takes a few minutes to get it all out), and then up inside the vacuum while the canister is out there is another filter you have to unscrew and beat all the dust out of that one too.Once I get all the dust and dirt out of the 3 areas (each and every time I use it), the suction improves 100% and I can get the job done. Hoping to find another vacuum thats less maintenance."
1,bissell powerforce sucks,Do not buy one.I purchased one of these and it lost its suction within 2-3 months.I purchased another one and it had the same exact issue.I should have read the reviews ahead of time but needed vacuum cleaner in a fast pinch and thought that this would be a good one.Do not buy this unless you are willing to waste your moneyIf I could give it ZERO STARS I WOULD.
1,Junk,"I owned the previous model of this vacuum, had it for several years, and loved it! So when it was time to replace the old one, I went and bought this model, even though it looked different and felt like it was made of cheaper plastic. After using this vacuum 5 times, the belt broke. I replaced the belt with the Bissel recommended belt, used it again, and it broke after 2 times of using it. I got my boyfriend to replace the belt for a second time and still had the same issue, so I took the vacuum back and bought another one - exactly like the one I had and still had the same problem with belt breaking. In this case, you get what you pay for. Actually, I didn't even get what I paid for, considering I couldn't even get the thing to stay working!"
3,Could be better,"I bought this set so I could prepare for the GRE, since there are not many options for CAT-specific software. While I find some of the low-budget cartoons amusing (there are segments where the program tries to make you chuckle), the software has some pretty big problems. The audio for many sections cuts in and out, which can be a bit frustrating in the middle of lessons. Also some of the word drills available in the games section don't work very well. I'd have to say that when the tutorials are working, it's a fun program that tries to put you at ease. However considering all of the glitches, I'd recommend searching more for other potential CAT-specific GRE prep programs."
4,Very Helpful Study Tool for the GRE,"I really found this study tool to be quite helpful in preparing for the GRE. It helped me significantly improve my scores. I followed the personalized study plan the program devised for me based on my performance on the diagnostic and my specified time table. Furthermore, I learned to master the nuances of the computer adaptive format of the GRE. Although the program is a bit juvenile at times with the cartoons and movies, it helps enliven the sometimes dull GRE content and lessons. I would definitely recommend this product."
5,Box Link Sterling Chain,This item was shipped so fast I didn't even have a chance to anticipate the delivery date! Thanks $1mm!! The item was beautiful and arrive in perfect order.
4,Must read for fans of the movies.,One thing I found interesting is that the book actually has a very similar ending to the newest movie. It may even help explain the movie's ending.
5,Just as Seen In Picture,"This Is Just as shown in the picture... exactly what i ordered, what more can i say"
2,Disappointing. Not even worth a rental,"Sorry, this is a disappointment. Went out to buy it first thing. No Halo. Part of the problem is just feels to realistic. You keep shooting these robot like things and they don't fall down. Also, the concept is sort of stupid. The robots have weird faces, etc. It was just very disappointing."
2,two thing wrong,The only things I can see that are wrong with this are the fact that it your child does not stay still in his sleep he will end up on the floor and the bed on top of him and possibly suffocating your child and also the pump took for ever to fill up the bed. It is a good idea but kind of tippy.
5,The easiest and tastiest cokbook I've yet to come across.,"I just started cooking not to long ago and I have been trying out lots and lots of cookbooks. I love eating healthy, low-fat foods and this book is absolutely wonderful. So far I have not had one bad meal using any of these recipes, and can not wait to try out more of them. It has a wide variety of entrees, side dishes, soups, salads, and wonderful desserts. I am usually only cooking for one or two but all of the recipes can be doubled easily and taste just as great. If you want to experience great low-fat cooking you can not pass up this book."
5,hazelnut cappucino cooler,"Love the product, I can't find it in stores in my area, so this is GREAT! Thank you... fast shipping, product as expected!"
4,"Inspiration, good advice, lots of laughs","This book helped me a lot. I've been paddling a plastic 16-foot kayak for two years and felt I was ready to advance in the sport. Reading Glickman's book was the next best thing to knowing a really experienced paddler who is happy to answer all your questions - including those you don't know enough to ask. When he listed the common mistakes paddlers make in the forward stroke, he could have been talking about me. I followed his advice and saw immediate improvement. The chapter on choosing a kayak was invaluable, and will save me a lot of money and time when I'm ready to upgrade. Glickman's stories of the trials and tribulations of his epic wilderness paddles were alternately inspiring and very funny. If you love kayaking - or think you might - you'll devour this book."
1,Don't read this book if you are over 13 years old!,"I ordered this book after reading all the Twilight and Sookie Stackhouse books and was very disappointed. I only read about fifteen pages and gave up because the book was so childish! I know that the Twilight books are young adult books also, but the story was so good I finished the entire series in a week. This book is nothing in comparison. It is only about 200 pages and has huge type. It reminded me of the books I read in sixth grade! The Sookie Stackhouse Southern Vampire Series are short books also, but at least they deal with adult topics and the type is of normal size. I really wanted a new vampire series to read after I finished Twilight and Sookie Stackhouse since I enjoyed the books so much and wasn't ready to leave the world of vampires yet, but the Vampire Diaries just doesn't cut it. The characters aren't developed and the writing is very immature. I think I'll try the Anne Rice vampire books instead!"
1,Struggling,"I picked this book up on a whimp because a co-worker said she enjoyed it. I found it pretty dissapointing. I had to force myself to get through this first book in the hopes that the next 4 are not so miserable.I find all the characters to be very shallow and unbelivable, especially Elena's 2 best friends and their unquestionable loyalty. I also found the romance to be so cliche. How many times do they have to say ""oh, stefan!"" and ""Oh, Elena..."" really now...All in all, if you are about 12-15 you might like it because it is very childish. I am currently reading the 2nd book, and find it picking up a bit. But I, like many other raters, prefer the much more mature version on the TV series."
5,"The Awakening (Vampire Diaries, Volume I)","This book is very well written. I loved it. It had a very good plot to it. You couldn't even begin to guess what would happen next. The end was very surprising. I would recommend it and the other books in the series (The Struggle, The Fury, and Dark Reunion)"
1,Not as good as I hoped,"So I absolutely love the TV show. Surely the book is even better, right? Uh no! The book is awful. It is poorly written and boring. I have no idea how this inspired such a good TV show."
4,Vampire Diaries,I am a huge vampire diaries fan and this book helped see where the show is coming from. I enjoyed the read.
1,Just bad,Don't even bother. Terrible book. The characters are soooo unbelievable. A huge waste of my time when the tv show is way better.
5,I Love The Vampire Diaries,"The first time I ever read Vampire Diaries, I couldn't put it down (I still can't). It has become my favorite book series of all time.I love Elena and Stefan, they are the perfect couple, I also cried at the end of the third book when I thought they could never be together.I relate alot to Elena and I am inspired by the Story.L.J. Smith is my favorite author, I hope she keeps writing more books! I also enjoy reading her other books, such as The Secret Circle and Night World series."
3,The Vampire diaries Book one.,Very much a teen book. I enjoyed the Twilight series and thought this would be of the same caliber. Not quite.
5,AN EXCELENT BOOK SUSPENCE TO THE END AND THEN SOME!,This book and all of the vampire diaries accutly is a magnificent book i loved them all they kept me up beause i could NOT put them down i think 5 stars is hardly enough but tis the highest rankest so it will have to do
1,I'll Wait for the Next to preach and praise,"After reading this latest book by L.J. Smith, I am prepared to the worst this series has to give. I didn't like this volume in particular, too much lovey dovey females aimed situations, but I'm still hopeful that Smith still has the power to pump out powerful and beautiful books in the future. Get well!"
5,Thrilling read,I thought this book was great. I loved it from the moment I picked up the book. I started watching the show and was captivated by it (I have to say I am 41 years old). I decided to try out the books. I like the fact that they made the show different from the books - the fact that you don't know what is coming up in the show or the books are nice. Elena does start out very conceited at the begninning but then changes as the book goes on. If you watch the show and want to read the books just open your mind up to the fact that they will be different from each other - it is much more enjoyable that way.
5,Amazing,I actually started watching tvd and I love the book much more! If you like the show you will love the book!
5,The Awakening Vampire Dairies,"I loved this book, it is better than the TV series although I love that as well. There is alot more happening in the book, you almost wish you were there in it. I love the way Stephan is a stronger vampire in this book and he is using humans for blood, in the TV series he never does that.I would love to see the books over here in Australia......"
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this CD based on 11 five-star reviews. Didn't find it calming at all, in fact I found the music so annoying I didn't have enough patience to listen to the whole thing. Much happier with the Richard Kaplan CD that I ordered at the same time. Anyway, I think that for the moment I'll stick with Arvo Paert when I feel the need to calm down."
3,so-so,"this is a good indicator however i had to put a paper backing on it so that i could tell what the lettering said since the plastic is transparent and black and not white and black... this is a bad design flaw, also it spins freely and easily when you don't want it to"
4,It Works,"It works for me. Suprisingly the suction cup has not fallen off of my dishwasher. And the dirty-clean spinner, while a little loose, hasn't rotated all the way around on accident. A firmer feeling spin might raise the rating, but for two dollars this little spinner just works.Note: my dishwasher is black. While the clean side is clear on black (not white on black), it is still visible against the black of the applicance."
5,No more confusion!,"Our dishwasher has all plastic outsides except for a 3 inch strip at the bottom. All of the big-box store sell only the magnetic option which is frustrating. My mother has had this type for years and so we found it here on Amazon and ordered it right away. It's nice for a family with shared responsibilities to know when it's been run and when it's time to unload or okay to load the dishwasher.As soon as the control dial on the dishwasher is turned to run, we spin the dial to ""clean"" and then once the washer has been emptied, we spin it to ""dirty"" so we all know when we can continue loading. It's so much nicer than openning the door and looking at the dishes to look for any residue to clue you in if they're clean."
2,Not the best choice,"This product would have been a lot better if the two sides of the disk were in colors other than black and white. But the main problem is that just opening and closing the dishwasher door can cause the disc to easily spin, which defeats the purpose."
4,Inexspensive Purchase & does what's needed,"We got this so everyone in the house would know the status of the dishwasher and fill it when empty. We also have a nanny at the house when we are not so this helps keep her informed too.It is a suction cup and only fell off once after the 1st time I purchased it and has not again yet.Mine came with a slight chip and black paint in the clear area but it isn't a big deal.It looks nice and more modern than some of the others.We have a steel dishwasher and all the lettering shows up just fine.Also, the wheel does stay where you place it. I was concerned that once I put it on a certain phrase (clean vs dirty) and opened and closed the door it may move but it hasn't appeared to thus far so I have been pretty happy with it.Inexpensive purchase and it does what is needed."
2,disapointed,the problem is the suction cup isn t holdingso the it s kind worthlessthe solution as previus review glue a magnet
1,Not a fan,It spins very easily so your dishes can look clean when they are really dirty just by brushing up against it.Not worth it.
4,Quite good with small room for improvement,"The dishwasher indicator is functional, well constructed, and useful. I am pleased with its quality and the fact that it matches well with our black fronted dishwasher. Two small items for improvement; (1) the white background could be a little brighter, for more contrast with the dark background of our dishwasher; and (2) it could use a little more friction so that it wouldn't spin around quite as easily."
5,just what I needed,"Box received quickly and the quantity and quality exceeded my expectations. Ordered to use on my dog, but I have found other uses including wrapping my own knee instead of using an ace bandage."
2,Camera fell off,This t-adapter is made of two metallic parts with two small screws keeping both parts together by friction. This is inadequate. My camera was attached to a telescope and fell off.
2,"Perhaps a song, if you're of a mind to think so.","It's like someone playing a song off key and much to fast, you recognize the song they're playing but the feeling's just not there. It leaves you kind of wanting...I'd enthusiastically recommend the first 2 volumes, to me they are a rare masterpiece. This third volume I do not think I would recommend. This is not to say that you should or should not watch it, I really can't say much on that subject."
4,Well received gift,Gave this to my sister and brother-in-law for Christmas. They said it was very pretty and a nice weight - looks good on the bar. They haven't had a chance to determine how effective it is as a chiller so I couldn't fairly give it 5 stars.
4,My Favorite Spy,I saw this movie over thirty years ago and thought it was a great movie; when I watched it recently I still enjoyed it but not as much as when I was younger. It seem more thrilling then. Still I enjoyed it and love classic movies that are comedies.
4,Enjoyable,"Bob Hope always makes me laugh, I enjoy his humor. This story was predictable but the humor made up for that. I would recommend this movie if you like comedies."
1,1-2 Days = 2 MONTHS?????,"I ordered 4 of these cables, the shipping date showed up as August 29th....what the heck? It said ""usually ships in 1-2 days""...if the vendor is OUT OF STOCK for two freakin' months, SURELY they could let you know before you order them!!"
3,This book is not primarily about Paul,"The title of this book, ""Paul Between Damascus and Antioch"", is a little misleading. This book is not nearly as much about Paul as it is about earliest Christianity.Hengel explores the first 15-20 years of the Christian movement in great detail. Unlike many scholars today, Hengel gives the book of Acts a great deal of respect as a reliable source of historical information for this era. This aspect was refreshing.Unfortunately, I did not come away from this book with the belief that I had learned much of anything about the person of Paul. However, I did learn a great deal about the Christian movement in the 30's and 40's C.E.A basic knowledge of Greek vocabulary would be beneficial to the reader of this book, but its certainly not necessary. You can know nothing of the Greek language and still learn much.A much superior book on Paul is by F.F. Bruce entitled, ""Paul - Apostle of the Heart Set Free""."
2,Bad translation,"This book was apparently written in German and then translated into english. And it certainly reads as clearly as any instruction manual transled from Japanese. After struggling through the first chapter, I just put it down."
5,Fun and memories,"A couple of happy evenings in St. Marks Piazza before traveling on to Venice were what my wife and I had listening to music like this. We danced with glasses in hand and smiled as the musicians enjoyed our enjoyment. Maybe this music won't mean much to those who have not traveled to Venice, but if you listen to it it will give you a smile and a wish to be. The small things in life are many times the most enjoyable. Have a listen."
1,Stopped working in less than 3 monthd,"This is a comfortable mouse that installed and worked out of the box with minimal effort. Unfortunately, it stopped working in less than 3 months. The large USB connected component and the mouse both appear to be working, but the mouse does not move the cursor. I downloaded the manual and also searched for troubleshoting information but have been unable to get it working descpite a couple weeks worth of trying. Considering the price, I would have expected better."
2,Read the manual,"No additional information, the book doesn't cover any new ground or offer any added value, the information is a recap of the manual...although in a abridged form, which may be better for some usersSkip this one, read the well presented manual....."
4,Comfortable and unique looking,These definitely look different from any other shoes that I have. I have grown to like the stitching detail on the uppers. Taking another reviewer's advice I bought some thinner laces at the drugstore and the shoes look and fit a lot better. I don't think the athletic style laces fit this shoe well.The Kip Oxfords require very little break-in time. They are very light and have excellent cushioning all over. I have had several pairs of Rockports and these exceed those in comfort and style.These are a good value at $45. I am not sure how some of the reviewers got them for $30. Other online shoe sites do feature these same shoes for around $90.
3,It's okay,"Purchased these to make solé per the ""green smoothie girls"" recommendations. Wile I'm guessing its good for you (solé that is) I found it impractical and difficult to stick with.The product came as advertised. But if using for a medicinal purpose, I'd find someone to borrow a rock from before making the purchase. I do believe it to be a good bit over priced, personally."
4,Actionable steps on putting more discipline in your life,I've known Harris for a couple of years now and would to say that he is among the most disciplined persons I know. He can juggle so many projects at once it's amazing.The book provides an actionable plan for increasing productivity and living a more enriched life.Highly recommended!
2,"Very disappointed, lots of filler with little substance","From the reviews, I was expecting more. The word ""discipline"" was used so often without giving a clear definition or clear steps of how to obtain it. A lot of the meaning of this book was lost in ramblings about their authors own lives, families, and innate discipline.Mostly the emphasis was on maintaining a strict schedule and talking to yourself in your head to trick yourself into doing something. Yes, positive affirmation can go a long way to training the mind to achieve your goals, but this approach was unscientific and childish.Save your money."
4,"""A good read""","I enjoyed reading ""Discipline: Training the mind to manage your life"" by Kern and Willi. As an executive manager with a large corporation for the last 14 years I have read a lot of personal development books, but this one is different. The book is concise, succinct, and precise. Whilst at times entertaining this book is focused on the reader getting their life together with pragmatic maxims."
5,I'm exercising consistently now! I used to have every excuse,I'm exercising consistently now! I used to have every excuse in the book (even more then Kern and Willi have in this book) to miss my workouts. After 7 months I'm proud to report that even in India - I'm a believer and I play those mind games all the time. You guys have changed my life!
1,Simply read an excerpt and decide for yourself.,"Be your own judge, read an excerpt. What you see is what you'll get. This book lacks the faintest trace of substance, the authors any trace of authority. Harsh but true."
5,Behringer Xenyx 802 and Amateur Radio,"I bought this mixer at the recommendation of Bob Heil (K9EID) of Heil Sound fame. I put it in line to my Yaesu FT-897 after making an adapter for it. My reports went from ""Sounds good"" to ""WOW!"". I have a deep voice and this allows me to let it stay deep for ragchews or increase the highs to punch through pileups. The adapter was simple to make with an RJ-45 and a mono "" plug for the microphone to mixer and a Heil AD-1 iCM adapter for the mixer to radio. http://heilsound.com/amateur/products/headphone-adapters/index.phpMy on air reports tend towards the AM quality. Plenty of bang for the buck here!"
5,Great Small Mixer for the Money,"This is the second small Behringer mixer I've purchased this year (I also have the Xenyx 1202fx). So far I have been extremely pleased with both mixers. I use the 802 to record instruments (bass, guitar, keyboard, drum machine) directly into my laptop, with the assistance of an Edirol RCA-to-USB converter. The channels are clear and noiseless. What ""imprints"" onto the cakewalk tracks shows no discernible sign of distortion or coloration. All jacks and knobs work well and appear solidly built. There are no effects, but I wouldn't use them anyway so that is a non-issue for me. Note that there is no on/off switch (again, not a problem for me personally as I turn on my equipment with line plug switches). Also, the light is VERY bright, but that is easily solved by covering it with a small piece of electrical or duct tape. I highly recommend both mixers."
4,Behrnger Xenyx 802 premium 8 input Mixer,"it is a mixer that you would use in the house not for professional,but for house use is really good and of corse you can use the 8 input at onceI like it, the price is really goodTHE ONLY THING THAT I DID NOT LIKE IT ABOUT IS THAT THIS MIXER DOES NOT HAVE ON AND OFF BUTTUNSOON AS YOU PLUG IT IN THE MIXER IS UP AND RUNNINGI DON'T LIKE THAT.BUT OTHER THEN THAT IT IS A COOL MACHINEA SCALE FROM 1 TO 10I'LL GIVE IT AN 8THANKS!!!!!!!!!"
2,Behringer,"I want sellers to sell the appropriate cords with these kinds of items so that the buyer does not have to search around for it.This is actually the second thing I purchased with the hopes of getting a clearer sound during recordings. Both items came on time and this item came exceptionally fast. The seller was great. However, I have searched the manual and used several different mics and they are not picking up the sound and it is not working. Neither Behringer products that I bought works as the manual states. I believe it is the cords or just the set up. Anyhow, it is now collecting dust with the other until I figure it out."
5,Works great!,"I ordered one of these when I needed to control all of my inputs for playing or recording jams, and this sucker works great. I love the preamps and the low noise coming into my firewire 2626, I will probably buy 2 more for my Drummer and Guitarist as gifts!"
4,Great for what it has,"Maybe its too much to ask for XLR outputs, but I'm asking. Also, I use the CD/Tape input for backing drums out of my PC, using the Berhinger USB external sound card. For some reason, I get a high pitched sound through the control monitor channel. It doesn't seem to show up on the recording, but I can't get rid of it, and I don't understand why its there. Otherwise its a solid unit."
4,Great little mixer,Didnt work out for me but I'd recommend them to a friend if they were looking for an inexpensive small mixer.
5,Super Mixer,Excellent mixer for my needs. Just don't know how they build so much for that smallprice. Amazing.
5,One of the most moving books I ever read,"World of Yesterday is an unforgettable classic and it should be mandatory reading in high school. In this autobiography, Stefan Zweig not only tells his life story and how he became a successful writer in Vienna, but he also paints the most vivid picture of Europe in the beginning of the century, with heart-breaking detail of the consequences of World War 1 and Hitler's rise to power on his life and the life of all Europeans. What touched me the most is his suggestion of a free-thinking continent with symbolic borders and no passports, and his definition of peace. Reading this book reminded me of the meaninglessness of war. How one's friend and neighbor living across the river can become his ""enemy"" once war is declared. Its message is still 100% valid today. Just watch the world news..."
5,"SHINE GOT ME ON ""THE RIGHT TRAIN""","Larry Thompson so eloquently writes about the importance of being on ""the right train"" in life. You can work on which ""seat"" you're going to take later, but you have to be on the right train. I was wandering aimlessly in my career and personal life. I thought my train had left the station long ago without me. I was wrong. My train had been waiting for me the whole time. SHINE got me to the station and on the right train. I'm now on my way to my destiny! Thank you, Larry Thompson."
2,Disney's Sing Along-Very Merry Christmas,"I ordered this DVD thinking that it would be in the same format as the VHS sing along that came out in the 80's. The actual songs are good but the narration is not. As my son puts it ""the voice is sorta scary""."
5,disney's sing along songs,this is for my granddaughter and she really like to sing along with music and likes to listen to music.
3,We LOVE this show but...,"I have ordered this DVD twice, from two different sellers and both copies tend to completely freeze up in different locations. One of them works fine on one particular DVD player in my house, but when I play it on my XBOX 360 the freezing happens right in the middle of ""Let It Snow"". On that copy, it must just be my player. But the other disc I ordered freezes up on everything. GREAT show though. I put it on while my daughter takes a nap. Hope it plays for you."
3,Disappointed-Not as expected,"Disney was very misleading on this CD. I have the VHS version that I played many times over the years. I wanted the same on a CD, only to find out that they changed the format & included a lot of talking in between the songs - not something children are interested in - they just want to sing along. And trying to find & play the next song only without having to listen to all that talking was next to impossible, as the songs were not numbered in this way."
1,Ingredients missing from recipe.,"I was so excited to try these recipes and was so disappointed. The first one I tried to put in a jar was Lemon Poppy Seed Cake. Ingredients would not fit in the 1 quart wide-mouth canning jar. Cut back flour and decided to try the recipe anyway. Recipe states cream the butter, butter was not put in the ingredients to add to the recipe. So no idea how much butter to cream. Contacted the author of the book and no response.Tried another recipe Barley Rice Stew again ingredients did not fit in 1-pint wide-mouth canning jarI'm done with this book and would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Not my top pick.,"There are not many recipes in the book to begin with, and only about 30% that I have tried have been worth making again."
3,"good pictures, not much substance.","This book has some wonderful pictures in it. A great coffee table book to flip through and look at all the really nice golf holes Mr Fazio has built. Unfortunately from reading this book, You would think that designing a course is just merely looking at the land and just sticking golf flags in the ground. If you are looking for a more technical explanation (and more thorough) description of the how and why of a golf course, get Nicklaus by Design."
1,Fooled,I bought the Worx weed wacker and thought the replacement spoolwas the one that matched the product I bought. Unfortunitlythe spool is for a different model!!!
4,Just shy of great.,Simple light and easy to use. the only thing that would be nice is an extra flap in the back to cover the screen when not shooting and sort of a hood when you are. Other then that It works!!! If you shoot a lot on a tri-pod it might be worth spending the extra cash for the velcro bottom but I think it could be done if you know how to sew.
5,Epson T5570 PictureMate Color Ink and Paper Pack,"It is nice to be able to order the Epson brand and to get such a savings over even the ""discount stores"". I purchased 2 boxes and got free shipping. What a deal. We love our Epson PictureMate. We have never tried the compatible ink packages."
5,Epson Picture Mate Printer Kit,Super and easy to use. Much better than other paper and ink on after market. Very pleased
5,Epson Ink is the Best!!!,I won't even thry after-market cartridges because the quality of Epson ink is superior to all other types of ink. The pictures are of photo shop print quality!!!
4,Epsom picture ate print pack,Purchased for a family member and the paper worked out very well. The colors in the photos were bright and true.
1,Product defective. No ink.,Product received in new unopened package but was defective with no ink. I give this zero stars. Do not buy this product.
2,EBSON PICTURE MATE INK,"I HAVE ALWAYS USED EBSON INK FOR PRINTING MY PICTURES--THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I ORDERED IT--TWO THINGS,THE CARTRIDGE SHOWED HALF FULL--SECOND,THE COLORS WERE OFF--I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS SHIPPED TO ME OR WHAT--"
1,Warning!! Ink not completelyfull!,"I bought this ink [...] The ink was only 60% full and the pictures came out green. If you need to but ink for your picturemate printer, but the ink in store. The return will be so much easier."
4,one more thing...,"I love that the ink and the paper come together in one pack, but why don't they have ink by itself?? I've needed ink more than paper and now I have a bunch of extra paper. The printer, the paper, and the ink are all great though!!"
1,Does not perform consistantly,"I purchased this a few months ago. Almost from the start I got errors trying to print pictures. More often than not the first picture printed each time would come out with the wrong colors and lines going through the picture. I would then have to perform a cleaning a couple of times and then it would print normally. This problem was repeated every time I tried to use the printer. Now when I try to print, even cleaning it doesn't help. I keep getting error messages telling me to replace the ink cartridge, even though the cartridge is no where near empty. Maybe I got a faulty cartridge, but whatever happened I hate paying for something that never worked correctly."
2,Small Book,I didn't realize that this was just a very small book that was being used as a fund raiser. I love Bill Bryson but was soooo disappointed when I got the book.
4,A brief but interesting book -very short.,"This African diary was informative and entertaining. Bill has a way of making regular situations hilarious. I was very surprised to see such a small volume though, but knowing the proceeds go to charity helped me to feel less ripped off. I hope Bill goes there for a full length adventure he can write about someday."
3,Far too short and unsatisfying.,"The first book I have ever downloaded to my Kindle and was left wondering if I had, in fact, received the whole book! I normally love Bill Bryson and have never been disappointed. Glad to have bought it just to contribute to the Foundation, though.I would recommend any of his other books."
2,Bill Bryson' African Diary Review,I was disappointed that there wasn't more writing to it. I also would have like to have known that this was a contribution in advaned
5,Not for everyone,"If you like a true jazz rock fusion with a heavy rock sound, than this is it! The most amazing rhythm section I've ever heard. Not accessible to an 'average' music fan, though very rewarding to the connaisseur. It's intoxicating."
5,Rockin Hard,"This trio of Gambale, Hamm and Smith really rock out with great groove in odd meter. Great fusion cd!"
2,Be Smart in other Countries!,"Why do they always depict college students as sex crazed, party going, irresponsible, extremely poor judgement of common sense characters in movies. They also had to include an immature adult male to go along with the adolescent behavior.The plot was farfetched. Why would anyone be dumb enough to give someone their passport. Like one reviewer stated, a moving train to steal human organs, come on. It seems to me that this movie was more about the gore than anything. Toward the end, I started to laugh at the movie. The guy falling from the train to the rocks below, while missing the water was priceless. Such as the guy doing the carving throughout the movie, was run over by the train. How did he roll over on his back when his neck seemed to have been broken?Well for some, I'am sure they will enjoy it. This is not my type of movie though."
4,It truly is Hostel on a Choo Choo,"Well more like Hostel and Turistas. Yep it isn't just violence for violence sake about half way through u discover why the killing is occurring and u may reflect for a moment or u may rewind just to watch that person get char-boiled again. Something I did not expect was how long this movie is. It seemed very long for a horror movie but it really kept me engrossed. In closing if you are waiting on Hostel 3 but don't know if it's on Eli Roth's to do list yet, check this out I think you will enjoy it"
3,a decent direct to dvd movie,i did not expect much when i rented this movie form the redbox but a friend of mine reconmend it so i rented it. it is not a great horror film but for a direct to dvd you could do worse. an amereican college wrestling team competing in eastren europe have a wild party one night and oversleep and miss their train to odessa for their next match. the coach is mad but then a woman offers then a ride on a different train heading to odessa. unfortanly it is a front for a black market organ trasplant operation and they are the next unwilling donaters. ture the plot is stupid and is not orignal at all and has a poor script. but the actors did a good job as they could with the matrial and the gore effects were amazing and old school. none of that cgi crap. so that is one place were they hit on all cyinders. so all in all it is a decent horror film and will appeal to gore hounds. just do not expect too much form it
3,"PRETTY GORY ,AFTER ALL NOT BAD!!!!","Train (2008) is basically ""Hostel"" and ""Turistas"" with slightly less gore. The plot is simple. Some American kids end up on an Eastern European train that is in the business of harvesting American organs while the donor is still alive. The kill scenes were decent and included legs removed while conscious, tongue cut out, multiple organ removal scenes while the victims are screaming, spinal cord cut with pruning shears, and burned alive. If you like torture slasher flicks then you might want to give this one a watch..."
3,Informative...Yes--Too Informative...Maybe,"I used this text in my 3rd semester Materials class at Stevens Institute of Technology (the school at which Professor Ohring currently teaches at). I liked the overall structure of the book--the material was presented in a rather orderly fashion, having each new concept build upon earlier concepts/methods/procedures that were touched upon. At times however, I feel the material presented became too deep for an introductory level Materials course. I had a hard time distinguishing the core material and theory from the many specialized, specific examples and applications discussed. At times, I became exasperated and despondent because I could not fully understand the concept that was being treated. I feel that this would be better used for a more advanced level class than an introductory"
5,Whoa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book sucks you into a mystifying and yet sill beleviable view of the future. Although I don't belive the ""future"" as stated in the book totaly, since as of yet there is no ""Pete Armstrong"" yet born; however, I truly belive that the world is scheduled for another prodigy. The book is well researched and written beautifully. While reading this book I felt that I was in the same time-line as the characters. This book is a must read!!!-TT"
2,The Demagoguery Machine,"The Truth Machine is nothing more than pedantic PC dogma couched as speculative fiction. How anyone could forsee a truth machine as being liberating and self-actualizing is beyond me. It's ironic that Mr. Halperin mentions Orwell's, 1984 but doesn't recognize that his conceit is nothing more than a technological Big Bother.In addition to the paternalistic liberal propaganda, the story itself suffers from poor characterization and a hackneyed plot. As others have mentioned, treatment of ethical issues are dealt with shallowly and the protagonists are insipid. The contrived resolution of Armstrong's fate is laughable and the sole character in the book with any personality is the A.I. (a machine) that does most of the narration!The only thing that I can identify with in this book is Mr. Halperin's attempt to get free marketing information from his ""survey""; Scoggins would have loved him for that."
5,"Riveting, believable, wonderful","I've just finished The Truth Machine and found it riveting. The premise is believable, and the story was a wonderful plus. I have subsequently word-of-mouth advertised it, although I don't think it'll need it. I am even going to get my husband to read it, and he NEVER reads fiction. You know you've become ""attached"" to a story when the next book you pick up pales in comparison. Valerie JL Spence, Kingston, Massachusett"
5,"Exciting, believable, stimulating.","Riveting basic premise and story -- makes an extremely credible effort to gauge and factor current and future acceleration of social, societal and technological trends. Does NOT underestimate the the probable future effects of technological development on the human condition. The character relationships and conflicts are somewhat lacking in depth (i.e. almost all the characters unambivalently admire one another), although this could be due largely to the messianic plotline. Thanks to Halperin for his gift of writing this book!END"
2,Good idea that got lost,"The author starts out with a great idea but got lost along the way. The ending made me throw the book across the room. As for the writing style - had I turned this in to my high school English teacher, I would have flunked."
1,Bad on a couple of different levels,"I confess, it's been awhile since I read this book, but I recall it well enough to know that I felt the author had wasted my time. The only reason I even came back to this book was because at one point in my career I worked with ""truth"" technology and I remembered this book as an example of a good idea poorly presented. As someone once said, ""Some books should not be thrown away lightly. This one should be thrown with great force.""The prose clunks along, the characters lacked likeability or believablility. And, as one reviewer put it, the future ""world"" Halperin postulates was not very well thought out. Some items pop out of nowhere or have no connection to the story--like the bit about Einstein's brain--if you're going to mention it, USE it. A lot of the little factoids about the ""future"" are just gratuitous to show how different things would be, but they don't hold together in any sort of theme or logic.Going to have to say no on this one. With great force./b"
1,Does not print shipping labels!!! WARNING,"I bought this product because the advertisements all say ""Prints 4x6 Shipping Labels.""Once I received this printer, plugged it in, and called tech support, I was informed that while this printer does technically print shipping labels (only for Ebay or Paypal), it does NOT support or print labels through any of the main shipping companies: USPS, USP, or Fed Ex (unless you also subscribe to Endicia for $16 per month). I promptly returned it and called DYMO. Their 4xl printer is the only one I've found that prints typical shipping labels on a Mac computer through the major carriers. (They provide the Endicia software free of charge.) Be forewarned..."
3,Skip it if you have CCNA,"The material in the book is covered in the basic Cisco Certified Network Administrator. If you already have this certification skip this book. In fact, if you're CCNA and you need information for your job, but you're not ready for the CCNP, then pick up:Network Warrior: Everything you need to know that wasn't on the CCNA exam - an O'Reilley book - by Gary Donahue.This book is for people who have responsibilities for basic Cisco routers, but don't have a networking background."
2,Basicly... poor...,"Hi everyone... I think this book is a quick reference, but don't have real troubleshooting situations, the same information that you can find in other books or simply on CCNA. I've read this book in a morning. Not recommend. I'm sorry."
3,A Good Starting Place,"This is a very good survey of Shintoism. If you know nothing about the religion, this book will walk you through the most basic information. The book is separated into different topics and enplanes it through the lens of Shintoism, like: sacred texts and the afterlife.Even if you know a few things, this book is a good refresher. And you never know what basic detail you didn't know."
2,For D807? Come on....,"A lovely looking case, but it's a generic case which doesn't fit around the D807. The phone fits SO snuggly in the case that when you have a call, you can't get the phone out quick enough. So as a tester of your voicemail it's brilliant but as a case, well no."
1,Sirius is Expensive,"Dude, if you pay for a liftime subscription you can only trasfer you membership 3 times??? Ahh then what? So you have to take you in dash radio with you for the rest of your life!!!??? So I go buy a few radio's to tryout and I don't like the first 2 Im stuck with the third, for Life???!! Ok peeps if I buy a life time subscription it should be for my lifetime not my radios lifetime...."
3,Cotton Newsboy Cap - Black,"This hat is tight on my average size head, not at all as described. I'm trying to stretch it. It just seems all black hats run small? I hope it stretches."
5,Back to Basics,"This book is great and I would recommend it to everyone who is interested in getting the low down on what it takes to feel better and build healthful eating habits. Weight loss is just a nice side effect.The book is easy to read and explains each topic in scientific yet easy to understand terms. ALG's Fat Flush Book will remain as my basis for my menu planning for the rest of my life.My husbands says my skin looks better and so does my body. I don't have PMS as badly or mood swings, and I don't experience blood sugar crashes...Thanks ALG for putting my body straight!"
4,Similar to Lindora and Dr. Oz' You On A Diet,"Buy You On A Diet from Dr. Oz - it's an easier read and very similar, i.e., a lifestyle change to low carb low fat eating - plus the supplements and other tricks to keep your metabolism humming. If you need help/supervision, try Lindora if you live in CA. This is a medically supervised diet clinic that does the same but with support and daily or weekly weigh ins and counseling. All of them teach you the basics of a healthy lifestyle - these are not diets - they are avenues to changing your lifestyle, which is the only way to keep weight off."
5,Weightloss,It's about time someone is telling us the truth about weight loss that is achievable and makes sense!! This is a complete guide of the whole body!
5,You must try this program!,"My goodness, this program is not just a rehash of all the Atkins, Zone, and Sugar Busters, stuff.This woman is original. The concept of detoxing the liver to lose weight is mind-boggling BUT it works.I had a little trouble giving up coffee, but now, I have more energy than a 25 year old (I am 53 this September).Besides, my whole family loves the flax seed oil, loves the Long Life Cocktail and really enjoys the fat flushing herbs and spices the author recommends. Even the Fat Flush Soup is great.I encourage any body who cares abou their health and weight to read this and do this for a quick cleanse or for a lasting lifestyle change.C.M."
1,The fat flush plan,I followed this plan for 3 weeks and did not lose one inch. I gained a pound and was hungry all of the time.After spending a couple of hundred dollars on products to supposedly help you lose weight. Save your money.
5,"Finally a book that proves nutrition can heal, and help you lose fat!","This plan is extremely rewarding and the book is full of wonderful information on how we can heal through proper nutrition. I've long been a believer that dairy, wheat and excess sugar, especially refined white sugars and flours, are at the root of many modern chronic diseases as well as the obesity ""epidemic"" our western culture suffers from. Ann Louise Gittelman has given us a tried and true way to cleanse the body of the toxins formed by life-long consumption of these and to give our bodies a chance to naturally find balance again, without resorting to prescriptions, hormones and surgeries. The losing weight part is just icing on the cake!(an organic, rice flour and organic butter cream cake that I will only have in phase 3!)Jennifer Kersten, CMT,RYT[...]"
3,Innovative,"The premise is great! I was able to endure the program for about a week. At that point I had to modify it somewhat in order to continue. I realized that I could give up alcohol, coffee and even sugar but no salt not even low salt or sea salt was more than I could endure. I was still able to loose 10 pounds and incorporate the rest of the diet into my basic routine."
5,A diet that works and does not require you to exercise a lot,"I have lost 20pounds in 8 weeks and lost weight from the first day on the diet.I was supposed to exercise for 5 minutes a day on a mini tramploline to move my lymph fluids but did not do the exercise on a lot of days.I was supposed to walk for 30 minutes a day but could not find the time.I continue to lose weight each week.The only drawbacks have been hunger pangs at night and constipation from the high levels of protein.The plan is backed up by dozens of references.By eating flax oil ,fish oil and evening primrose oil, the dieter gets a balanced intake of healthy oils and speeds up metabolism.You can eat fruit, vegetables,eggs, meat, fish,chicken ,turkey etc so the diet is very flexible.I recommend this book as the plan really works."
3,DESPERATE TO LOSE WEIGHT,"This book is not enough at all. May be because while i am desperate to lose as much weight as possible, I knew more even than what is in the book. But, I believe it contains valuable info."
2,"If you're allergic, this book isn't for you","Well, I like Anne Louise and I think she has helped so many people but I am disappointed that I cannot do this eating plan because I am allergic to whey, borage and flax. Why can't it be a FOOD plan without the added supplements. What would happen it one tried the plan without the all the added whey etc.? Are there substitutes that one can use?I'm still waiting for someone to come out with something that takes we allergic folks into consideration.Congratulations to all who were successful and I only gave it 2 stars because I could not use it. I'm sure it's a good program for some."
2,Not a fat fix for me,"Well, in all the attempts to lose weight this isn't the plan. There is no way anyone with a ""normal"" brain could keep up with this diet. It probably works if you do it her way but just giving up the coffee I never made it past that."
5,Pure Knowledge,Found this book to be very knowledgeable and doable. Now all I need to do is to do it. I have already begun to incorporate some simple things and they seem to be making a difference. Feeling very positive about this book.
5,"Lost 8 inches from waist, hips, thighs -I'm very psyched","No program has ever done what this one has. I bought the book because of the cover and the author's reputation. Just finished the Two Week Fat Flush and I am hooked for life. I got the results, feel terrific and don't mind spending a little extra for supplements that will make me healthy for life.The book, the diet, and exercise program and the journalling experience are highly recommended.Thank you, thank you, thank you for chaning my body, my mind, and my spirit..I can't wait for the sequel..."
5,Very good music.,I can never figure out why Joseph Martin Kraus is not better known among classical music buffs. I strongly believe he should be included as one of the more talented composers of his time. I had the radio on one day and sat up and took notice when one of his symphonies was played. I have since collected all four of his symphonies and I consider them to be very worthwhile contributions to my Classical music collection.
5,A real must see!!!,"I saw Ron White's show on the Comedy channel last night and I busted a gut. He is hilarious. While the main review accurately reflects some of his work it doesn't come close to doing him justice. The facial expressions, the smile, the accent (Texas drawl, but not overpowering), the timing, etc. Even though I've already seen the show I will certainly buy the DVD. His routine about his ex-wife and her family will leave you rolling on the floor!"
2,Reused material,"A lot of this material was reused from the Blue Collar movies. But as someone told me if you like Ron White you will like this movie. I personally don't care 100% for him-but at times find him funny-that is why my rating is low. Yet, if you find him funny and you enjoy him on the Blue Collar show you will enjoy this movie. It is a personal prefrence."
3,I'll skip this salad,"I bought this DVD because I saw and enjoyed the first ""Blue Collar"" movie. I thought Ron White and LarryTheCableGuy were the funniest of the 4 and wanted to see more of their acts. Larry's ""GitRDone"" DVD did not disappoint, but this one did unfortunately. He already did the funniest bits in the ""Blue Collar"" show. I honestly thought the rest of his material was a bit lame. I suppose his ""trademark"" cigarette and glass of (what is supposed to be) alcohol were very cool and with-it in the 80's. But in today's world it's downright unhealthy and makes him look lazy. The material and structure is typical stand-up... you know what I mean : topic, set-up, joke, joke, ... ehmmmm,yeah, so anyway....topic, set-up, joke, joke,... yeah,that's how it is,anyway.... topic,set-up, joke, joke,ect. As you can see I was irritated by this show, maybe I should have a cigarette and a drink and try to watch it again. Till then I'd rather watch Mr White in the BlueCollar show, and give this DVD a miss."
4,Lugnut Day,"Not a bad release, but much of the material was done on the Blue Collar Tour movies (and with better results). I did find the bit about Lugnut Day quite amusing. Also, the bit about his (ex) wife and in-laws is hillarious, as well.If you have an extra 15 bucks and need some laughs, go for it. If not, just chuckle at your memories of Ron's performance on THE BLUE COLLAR TOUR:THE MOVIE."
3,Amazing Births...,"Attending Birth should be seen by all childbirth educators, providers and moms to be. The birth stories and videos of the moms giving birth are beautiful, amazing, and show clearly the way birth was and is created to be. The birth professionals and experts, Dr. Wagner, Robbie Davis Floyd give personal experiences with birth and information that somehow the Western world chooses to forget regarding the creation of life.This should not be missed.Maddy Oden"
2,I like the old Colorforms better!,"What happened to the Colorforms I played with when I was a kid? It was simply something you entertained yourself with; different combinations of clothes, scenery, etc. to experiment with. Does anyone else remember this or do I just have a poor recollection of this simple but self-entertaining activity? I wanted to buy my daughter one of these but I'm disappointed in the fact that they have chosen to transform it into a game where 2 or more players are required. What happened to encouraging children to play by themselves? Why did the manufacturers of this classic toy choose to make a board game out of it?? Oh well, I'll just have to look for another classic toy I grew up with and hope it didn't get changed as well.Signed,Flitter, The Disappointed."
3,overal all good value,"this toy engages my 2 year old son more than I thought it would. I would like to have seen the storyboards be larger, they are about 6 x 6 which isn't big considering the girl and the duck are about half that size. The sizes are not relative to the picture on the story board. But still a fun product"
5,Beautiful,"I ordered 4 total chains. 16, 18, 20, 22"". They all look beautiful and shine brightly. They all come in a simple and small zip type plastic bag. However one chain came so tangled that it took me 20 minutes to get it straighten. I'm guessing that this is rare since the others were perfect. My gal Loves how they look in groups of 3 or 4."
2,A no go,I was super excited to get this chain as I had been given a silver pendant and needed a silver chain. While it is very sturdy in construction within two weeks of wearing it the shiney silver finnish has worn off leaving the majority of this chain looking like cheep costume jewelery.
2,"Good for beginners, good recipes,","This book was good for beginners, folks just starting a workout plan.Buy the book for the recipes... this book gives very good options for tasty low fat / sugar foods."
1,Awful with dangerous exercises,"Simply put, this book is absurd. The diet prohibits fruit and bread, assuring failure down the road, as for any quick fix. I had to laugh at the ridiculous exercises in the book -- pushups off a big balance ball, both stupid and dangerous. Leaning forward holding the ball -- just GREAT for the back. My recommendation is to avoid any author with excessively white teeth."
5,AWESOME Book that made us feel very special!,"Oh I loved how the author expressed his appreciation of multiples and how we used dissociation to survive! Too often, especially in the Christian realm, MPD is referred to as a BAD thing and we often times have to hide who we became becuz of the abuse. But, the author of this book really encourages multiples and honors our hard work to survive and the creative talents we used to survive. It's an AWESOME book!! It was a book that made us feel really good about ourselves which is a good thing."
2,Low Quality,"The batteries worked okay for about 2 weeks, then began to lose charge quite fast, they yielded only 18 hours of stand-by charge once completely charged. They seem to be cheap fakes."
4,Interchangeable batteries,"I paid a couple of bucks extra for this battery instead of the BR50 widely advertised for my RAZR, since this is the model that came with my phone. What was delivered was the BR50 instead of the 5777A that I ordered. I asked the vendor, who said they were identical. Not worth returning to order a BR50 for a couple of dollars less. Live and learn, I guess.This battery works fine, and having a fresh battery does make a difference, although short battery life is still a problem with this phone."
1,Not as advertised.,I purchased this item expecting that is was a Motorola SNN5777A as advertised. Instead it is a generic knockoff that my Razr V3 claims is an 'invalid battery' and won't display a battery meter. I'm very put off by this.
4,Good game. Not as good as PC,This game has a decent storyline. The graphics are pretty good. It's just not as good as PC. It isn't as much fun to play.I would rent this before you buy it.
3,A low carb bible of recipes,"If you are a true low carber and you like to spend time cooking, this would be your bible. This is a huge collection of recipes which covers everything from soup to nuts. In addition, the author provides explanations of low carb ingredients and substitutes.I will warn you that some of the recipes are involved and have a lot of ingredients in them. Most are well researched and fit into your low carb diet just fine."
3,Not made of cotton.,"This item was a disappointment to me. I wanted a cotton bumper and took my chances with this one. It's made of polyester and so I returned it.But still, the product was well made and may have made a lovely bumper for someone who doesn't mind using unnatural materials in the nursery."
4,Celestine Vision on the mark.,Thoughtfullness in both content & approach. Mr. Redfield's books have helped me clear away the mind-junk.
1,dont do it,bought one does not work needle gets stuck in motion shift light comes on when it wants and is impossible to set sunpro refused to do anything about it
3,controller breaks.,"This blanket worked well, but the controllers are fragile and quit working.Nice product, but not durable. The circuit boards for controlling the temperaturewere easily broken"
5,Super Christmas Gift!,My niece bought this for her mom for Christmas. Mom had purchased heated mattress pads for them last year and she wanted to return the favor. Mom loves getting into a warm bed and it's especially nice since you can wash it. All are pleased and will look for more of their products!
4,missing something,the music was a little different but basically the same -- the concept was excellent -- but feel its to commerciallized -- wish to see her children - more personal touch -- my grandson lovesthe show cause of the familar format -- the different aminals they show -- my view is if it isnt broken dont fix it -- keep it the way it used to be -- the commercials turn everyone off -- the puppet action is grade a --
5,The Best!,"My children have loved all the Baby Einstein movies. They dcapture their attention, they aren't too long, and they are educational. Perfect combination!"
2,Disappointed in lack of story,"I see that other people also agree with me that this DVD was disappointing because it implied that the story of Noah would be told but reallly there was no Noah, just animals. I really wanted the have the Bible story with the animals for my baby and felt misled by the title. I've since discovered an interesting new line called Baby Miracle and there is a Noah's Ark DVD with brilliant graphics that tell the story of Noah. My baby loves the cute music and puppets!"
1,Marketing Trash,"I own thirteen (early) Baby Einsteins. All very good, until now. Baby Noah is the first to start directly marketing to the children. I don't want my 1-year old to be blitzed by Disney marketing executives, period. They've ruined a good thing.Maybe someone else will start producing videos for kids without the marketing junk."
5,A great Baby Einstein,"My toddler loves all the Baby Einstein videos but usually it takes him a few views to get excited about a new one. This one he loved from the first minute - maybe because some of the animals are familiar from prior videos? He only says a few words so far but the morning after I bought this he tugged at my pants and said ""Baby Noah!"" until I relented and let him watch it again. I am also very happy with the special features on this one - a storybook, discovery cards and ""guess the animal"", all in three languages."
2,Predictable,Ok as action thriller flicks go but it gets tedious as well as predictable about halfway through. The best part is watching Denis Leary - he plays a chilling killer. Check it out if you have nothing better to watch.
5,Still one of my favourite films EVER,"I can remember seeing this film about 7 years ago and bugging the local video store for its release so I could buy it. The acting is fantastic with both Emilio Estevez and a young Cuba Gooding Jnr doing a superb job. Stephen Dorf and the guy that plays Ray are also brilliant. The star of the show for me is Dennis Leary who is pure evil with a fantastic sense of humour as well. The DVD is simply BRILLIANT with great surround sound and picture quality. I would recommend this film to anybody. Shut the lights off, get your four pack and pop corn, turn the volume up and enjoy!"
1,Want to hear true expert singers of medieval music ?,"Try recordings of the late Andrea Von Ramm from the ""Studio der Frhen musik"" or Montserrat Figueras from ""La Capella Reial"" or again the vibrant voice of the late Barbara Thornton. While M. Lambert's voice is pretty it's also very monotonous and is more suited for pop music. Moreover she has no knowledge of the languages she sings in."
4,"Good Hitory and Review of ""Top Air Aces"" during WW1,WW2,Korean and Vietnam ""Top Guns"" !","This is a old VHS handled introdugtion,History and Reviewed and explained someWorld Well Known ""Top Aces"" in the world.Edition and clarity of pictures are notsatisfactory. but as the one of ""Light""refferences. CHUCK yeager,he was a nicetest pilots of flighting MiG-15bis fromSen.Lt.Roh who defected from N.Korea withMiG-15bis. he knew the neccessary ""Dogfight""even in near future. he also piced up small,light,agile , good maneuverable, fast F-20""Tigershark"" as one of imaginary Enemy Fighter !"
1,Too brief and tabloid that do investors and traders no good at all,"I didnt expect to learn much from a book that summarizes a great mind in only three to four pages. However, I also didnt expect the author, or editors employed by the successful fund manager/author/columnist to adopt that tabloid style to drill into the personal life rather than the investing/trading/business success of each. For e.g. on Benjamin Graham, ""Meanwhile, Graham was also busy bustling between his homes in La Jolla, California and Provence, France, where he ultimately died in the company of his long time French mistress, whom he'd courted away from his son!"" I had not read through the whole book, but similar ""insulting style"" was applied on Bernard Baruch, Jesse Livermore and William Gann, of which I had studied before. If you read to sharpen your edge, I strongly recommend you to put your valuable time and money somewhere else."
2,Assumes too much,"Very selective in what's included and what's not. There are certainly many trade journals out there, yet only THE CRAFTS REPORT is reviewed. There are a lot of areas left up to the reader to research, and some overly simplistic summaries."
5,A wonderful addition to any parent's library,"I love this book. The advice is practical and seems to speak to ""real"" parents of ""real"" babies -- and has about it a gentleness and true regard for both.As far as the a-z format, it works for me much better than one based on chronological development, because so many of the topics covered span different time periods with different babies.Regarding Dr. Sears' fantastic books: I don't see the two at odds at all. In fact, they complement each other very well. In another recent book of hers I read (""No Cry Sleep Solution""), she writes, ""Dr. Sears is my parenting hero."" A parent who's interested in informing her- or himself would do well to buy books by both authors. Each author serves to illuminate the message of the other...i.e., different words, similarly great approach.This book is chock full of helpful tidbits. You won't regret reading it."
1,crap,I had the first one replaces because the wire would not feed at all. the second one worked the first 3 or 4 times I used it and now it will not feed again. Do not buy this spend the extra money and buy a Hobart. or other American made product.
2,"Fantastic ride, but short life!","I bought one of these brand new at Target for $35 -- can I just say if you spend the hundreds that it's listed for at Amazon right now you are crazy?? It lasted my 3 year old about a year before it totally fell apart, and about half of that time it was stored for the winter, so it got maybe six months of intermittent use. They sure are fun while they last, but just not made like they used to be. We'd also bought the red/blue/yellow one for my son, and it got about the same amount of play time before it cracked and fell apart. My kids really aren't hard on toys, things seem to last well at our house, so I really just can't recommend any of these products... Just not worth the money. Well worth it to spend a little more and get the sturdier Green Machine."
5,The most beautiful version of Irish Tune from County Derry/Danny Boy,"I only purchased one music, and one of most favorite music, Irish Tune from County Derry. I've heard many version of the same tune, but this is, in my opinion, the most beautiful version of it. 99 cents is definitely worth it."
4,Sweep #13,"This was my first read in the Sweep series; I was pleasantly surprised that despite being #13 in the series, I was easily able to pick up the story. In other words, it can stand on its own. Alisa has recently discovered that she is half-witch. She is accepted in her circle but her best friend is wary of this knowledge. Her dad's girlfriend is pregnant and getting ready to turn Alisa's room into a nursery. She runs away to a relative on her mom's side, hoping to get more information about the strange visions she's been having. Her newly-found grandmother seems to hate her but other relatives are happy to share information with her."
5,excellent,"I loved this book, and I love this series. I couldn't put it down. I don't understand how some people reviewed this book below 5 stars. It was different than the other books, from a different person's point of view. I got to know Alisa more, and I am so happy she met Charlie, he sounds so nice.Everyone has to read this book, if they haven't read any of the series they definitly should, they are missing out."
4,Replacement,"Sent wrong side at first. Only primer, you will have to paint. It worked for what we needed, just to sell."
1,By the way,Just to let you people know...they have never made Last Full Measure..the third part of the Gods and Generals/Gettysburg trilogy.Ted Turner backed out it on the box office failure of Gods and Generals.They say it may still be made sometime down the road
2,"A disappointing book, poorly developed characters and plot.","The author appears to have written a few grisly murders and then quickly penned a plot in which to use them. How the victims could have been so easily set up for these particular methods of demise is a stretch of an already thin reality. Everything in the novel is too convoluted and too difficult to be even close to believeable. The principal murder is developed so that the villain is frustrated at every turn. Characters are an unreal spectrum of extremes: too successful, too beautiful, too talented..... The good guys are the average humans. The hero is a character we are too familiar with from other authors, a talented, hard working ex cop with instincts that save the day. The final confrontation is too choreographed and unbelieveable, suddenly the villain has fatal flaws, and all loose ends are neatly tied up in a happy ending"
2,The Gallant Men of Leisure,"Who ever said this is no Combat was right!!!! These GI's do more singing than shooting. A better title would be a soldiers life of R&R.;I did not know you could fire a BAR without your finger on the trigger or that the M1 carbine was fully automatic!!! The same village is used over and over, alongwith same footage of town battle scenes. The actors (if you want to be kind) do not act or move like soldiers. The only one who does a good job is Rob Mcqueeney andhe's not a soldier but a war correspondent. The saving grace is the guest stars and all the WWII war film footage. I was 12 when this show aired and thats why itappealed to me, as most shows of my youth hold fond memories (especislly westerns) I didn't have much memory of this show. Now I know why!!!"
1,Incredibly stupid and overly hyped!!!,"This book is so stupid it kind of makes you laugh. It says that it'll take an hour to learn how to use the cursor! The rest is just a bunch of bunk that means absolutely nothing. If you know absolutely nothing about computers (if you're reading this you do) then this is too basic a book for you. Also, any schools out there that think this is a good book as a textbook, you're troubled upstairs!"
2,The Cloud Messenger,"I would like to have known the publisher,the length of the book, and a table of contents."
1,frustrated with product support,I offer this assessment with a certain amount of sorrow and I offer it on behalf of myself and the friend who I gave this item for Christmas last year. I actually liked the knock box in terms of function. But I'm unhappy with the company response when I attempted to purchase replacement rubber grommets that split after a short time. I was told to buy the entire knock box bar and that was my only recourse. I found this to be very poor customer support. You can't tell me they don't have the rubber grommets they could sell at a fraction of the cost. Plus I don't like scrapping a perfectly good piece of metal. Very not green.
5,You should get this book!,"All of the recipes I was looking for. Authentic, informative and the food turns out great every time!! I highly recommend this book."
2,NO tech support,"Over the years, I've ordered several of VL's spanish programs directly from them when they've had sales. Many years ago, they had a customer service line, but no mas!I personally think VL Spanish programs are excellent, but after you've spent your money, if you need help (i.e. downloading software)-- you're on your own.All questions have to be answered via email ONLY. And guess what? If you send them too many emails, they'll BLOCK your IP address.NOT nice!So, they lose 3 stars."
1,Spanish,"Not worth the money. They start at the arse end and difficult to use. In retrospect I should have bought a different package, though I don't know which one would be better. Should have spent the money on lessons, which I am going to have to do now anyway. Not recommended!!!!"
4,A Different Sound Everytime,"First off, this is not my favorite Against Me! album. Not their greatest release to date. However, I still like it. It is still worth the purchase. Don't listen to the reviews about how they have sold out. The band has never had a consistent sound. Hell when it first started it was just Tom and his guitar. Against Me! has had a different sound each studio album they have released. ""As The Eternal Cowboy"" sounded completely different from ""Reinventing Axl Rose,"" and ""Searching for A Former Clarity"" sounded different from the others as well. This album is no different. It isn't titled ""New Wave"" for nothing.If The Clash had kept their sound the same every album, no one would remember them."
5,Required Viewing,"Obviously, if you're a Red Dwarf fan you'll probably own all the series anyway, but there is no doubt that RD3, Byte 1, is one of the essential videos to own. It is a fantastic intro to use when convincing friends why Red Dwarf is so good. But for this loyal fan of Red Dwarf the fun of all three episodes is to see how they were later used in the books. Having actually read all the books first I think they did a phenomenal job of stretching the story lines out onto paper. However, nothing is as funny as seeing Lister twirl the bat around and whack himself 'in the happy sacks'. Well that is if you like physical humor. Now I have to go watch it ONE MORE TIME."
3,Disappointing for a Barney video,"My 2 year old daughter is a major Barney fan and we have most of the Barney videos on either VHS or DVD. I was looking forward to getting this DVD because of the subject matter, but I have to say, after a couple of viewings, it's a major disappointment.The DVD seems to be kind of thrown together, the production values aren't the greatest, and the kids aren't especially interesting. My daughter has wandered off after a few minutes both times we've watched this one (which is rare - she's usually glued to the TV when Barney is on!)We're still fans of Barney and of many of his videos...just not this one."
2,A disappointing read,"From the title and chapter headings, I thought this book would explore the myth and meaning behind Harry Potter somewhere around the level of ""Goddesses in Every Woman"" or ""Hero with a Thousand Faces."" I am really disappointing that the level of analysis is closer to ""An Idiot's Guide to the Harry Potter Universe."" Don't buy this book unless you want a regurgitation of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, one of JKRs books for the Comic Relief charity.Harry Potter Schoolbooks Box Set: From the Library of Hogwarts: Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them, Quidditch Through The Ages"
1,oversite on manufactures,"The screw cannot be tight enough and it pops - I removed the cap ring and still it won't stay on a pepsi bottle.The inside straw should be a straight hard plastic straw, one that goes to the bottom - the current one is all curled up at the top of the bottle when in use. Obvious design issues going on here. It was returned.Harold Import Company Jokari Soda Dispenser"
1,useless junk,"It is hard to come up with any positive attributes for this particular product, so I will start with the negatives. The cap cannot screw on very tight because the seal is bad meaning that you strip the threads on the cap with any torque at all. Also, the straw to draw the liquid up is flexable plastic which is curled up for shipment, meaning that it will not straighten and only goes halfway down the bottle. Because of this, the despenser would only work for half of the bottle, which defeats the purpose of the cap anyways. As for positives, it does dispense at first if you shake the bottle hard, but this also destroys the carbonation that it's supposed to protect."
1,Buy a double cheeseburger instead,"Sorry folks, it just does not work. The only way to keep the soda fresh is to pump some CO2 back into the container - and those devices are not cheap. Don't be fooled, these devices do not work. Save your money and buy a double cheese burger - or two."
4,I recommend it to my traveling friends,Once in a while I am disapointed to find the mom & pop places are closed up & replaced by a corporate place. Those that pan out are right on the money with the reviews that are included in this book. Calling ahead is always smart.
3,Nunca he escuchado este disco. No lo encuentro en Japon.,Quisiera puder comprar este disco en Japon pero nose como
5,Great Idea that really works!,"Wow! It didn't go flat on me. This is one of those simple ideas that should have been thought of years ago when they first invented plastic soda bottles. Screw it on and pump it up a little. Your open bottle of soda will now last up to a week or more. Made right, they last a long time too. Have fun!"
4,Fizz keeper pump,I really like these product and it does work wonder when I don't drink much soda as long it stays fresh.
1,they don't work,"just received 3 fizz-keeper pump caps and all three do not work. i am very dissapointed because i had one many years ago that was great so when it broke I thought I would get three more, wrong......."
1,Lasted about two sodas,"This thing seemed real solid and worked great for two or maybe three sodas. Then something on the inside malfunctioned. I'm guessing some sort of rubber o-ring that keeps everything air tight slipped off and now any sort of pumping action results in no air movement. Very disappointed. Also, it appears there's really no getting into the thing and fixing this very fixable problem without cracking the plastic. This was the cheapest one of these things i could find with the free super savers shipping, but please spend a couple bucks more on another brand. I know I will be soon enough"
3,So So,"It works so so. It will fill the bottle up with air. It will keep the soda from going flat for a day or two, but not much more than that."
5,Fizz Keeper Pump Works Great!,We use this product on our 2 liter bottles of 7-up (for mixed drinks) and Dr Pepper and it works to keep the fizz for up to 5 days (depends upon how many times you open the cap). Excellent product!
1,ha,Too bad this product actually does nothing to prevent soda from going flat! Pumping oxygen into the empty space in a bottle doesn't actually affect the carbon dioxide within the soda. The only way that you could keep pop from going flat is by pumping it up with carbon dioxide to increase the partial pressure of the CO2. So chemically speaking this product doesn't work. Just learned this in chemistry class :) Placebo effect!
2,Not a big fan,"This kept on breaking on me. First the batteries wore out (after a month or two). Then the outdoor sensor died (I think because it got wet in the rain, but isn't an outdoor sensor supposed to be able to handle that?). Finally the indoor one died. I probably had it for less than two years. Not a big fan of this brand anymore..."
3,Not one of her best!,"This is not one of Norah Lofts better books. If you really want a good read and enjoy Historical Fiction may I suggest House At Old Vine, The Town House, Pargetters, or Bless This House. I am a big Norah Lofts fan."
4,5 years of use with no problems.,"Hi, i have this SD card from near May 2005, and today, March 2010, i have no problem.Only thing i would like to know if my kodak easy share z740 can hold a 4gb sd card.And, by the way, price at 2005 was around 45 usd + shipping.Still one of most expensives SD card.4.5 total score. But, thinking well, 5 years of continue use for the price (near 50.00 with shipping included), it is a great deal!!!"
2,It's okay,"I needed a kid's apron for a Halloween costume, so it served its purpose. If I wanted one for dress-up clothes, I would have bought a nicer one -- the straps are very thin and probably would rip off soon."
2,Material good; copy too much for price!,"The book is fine, in fact, a great introduction to German. However, a number of people in my class got brand new books for next to nothing and mine cost $35 and is definitely used."
1,cheaters,1 star is far too good..it deserves nothing.I will never buy wilton food products on line.I received my order that its expiration date has expired.
4,Solid Sony Product,"So far, I have had zero trouble out of the two Sixaxis controllers that I have. They are very accurate and have good range. They are easy to setup and charge quickly after the first full charge. The battery lasts quite adequately (sorry I never actually timed it). The controllers are pretty light and seem reasonably durable. What else can I say? Overall, this is a good solid product and gaming with the Sixaxis is quite enjoyable."
2,PS3 sixaxis controller (used),"The item description said the controller was in ""like-new"" condition, but when I received it, it showed signs of much use and actually didn't work properly. The left thumbstick doesn't automatically return to center so when I'm playing a game in which I'm moving a character around in a 3D environment, the character constantly moves forward, even when I'm not touching the controller. For a $42 controller, I'd expect it to work properly."
4,PS3 Wireless Sixasis Controller,"Fast Shipping, but the Controller had hair and dust on it. The Controller came in box with on only Office Max(not sure if it's the right company) Sale Paper Protecting it. Just including this, because I had controller damage by sony, after they repaired my PS3... don't want to experience that again... lol"
5,perfect,if you have a ps3 this is the item to have. i got it during the after thanksgiving sale for 20 each so i was thrilled :]
1,Garbage,"Spend the extra $$ to get a dualshock, these controllers are JUNK! Lightweight and very flimsy. I dropped mine off the couch and it didn't work anymore. I didn't even get to throw it before i had to get a new one! Why are controllers getting more and more expensive and more and more delicate?? Give me an old NES controller that can be dropped off a building and still work and I would be happy."
5,Works great!,"I bought the controller from Amazon because they had it cheaper than any other place i know of. The shipping was great and everything was well taken care of in the package.As for the controller its the standard controller that coems with the PS3, works the same, does everything great and is good for a backup or extra. It all works fine and i recomend buying it."
4,"Plus, Minus, Neutral","The controller is pretty much the same as the PS2. The only major pluses of the PS3 controller is the wireless capability and it has the PS button for other useful functions. The minus is the missing rumble pack, which takes away from the gaming experience. I'm currently neutral on the SIAXXIS technology because I haven't used it for any games yet. Having the feature doesn't hurt and may be a promising feature in the future.Advice to those who have older PS2 controllers: Buy adapters for your PS2 controllers so you can plug them into your PS3 when friends come around. It'll save you money for games."
3,Waiting for Dual shock 3,"Controller is nice but, not being able to remove the battery for recharging and plugging in a fresh one is annoying as I experienced today during online play of CoD4. Wasn't able to plug into the PS3 quick enough and lost some kills then got a weak death."
3,good but far from great,"I have to say honestly that the wireless ability and being able to turn your console on and off from the controller make this unit a worthy improvement. The tilt capabilities, I feel, are a gimmick and get pretty old quickly. If I want to get some exercise I'll go for a walk or something. I don't need to swing my hands around like a fool when watching t.v. (leave the cheap gimmicks to Nintendo.)the wireless is nice. the sixaxis is pointless. The overall size and heft of the controller makes it seem cheap. I stepped on one by accident and it shattered into a million pieces...not nearly as durable as the PS2 controllers...oh yeah..sadly lacking dualshock.. sixaxis??? give me a break.should've bought an XBOX"
3,It's a functional controller. Same as the one that comes with the unit.,"Well, this is the standard controller that comes with the PS3. I do wish that it had the rumble feature, but it has 6 axis control as well as wireless use. It's a nice controller.I'm sure Logitech will come up with something better for a lot less eventually, though."
4,feels great,"its teay to get used to if you have been a playstation fan throughout your life. not much difference except its very lightweight and there is that ps button in the middle. the only downfall is that there is no rumble. not a big deal, but i have heard complaints about it."
3,Left stick doesn't work well,"Overall the controller I bought works great, much better than the cheap gamestop version I bought beforehand. It's an improvement, however, the only thing wrong with it is that fact of the matter that the left analog stick on the controller is difficult to use for some reason; I have to press it rather hard and sometimes with both thumbs to get it to click."
3,Lolana is in it!,"First off, i want to say that Lolana is in this movie. Such a babe, a hottie, her alone is worth the purchase of this movie. Second, i would like to say that Lolana is in this movie! :) 5 Stars for Lolana, and -2 stars for the movie. So add or subtract that all up, 3 stars. The movie is set in the 1st century. Very old costumes, and time line. That alone makes the movie almost completely unwatchable. But my favorite adult actress Lolana, makes up for that. I think if the director and or producer made a movie with a 2000+ or even 1990's setting, they'd probably make a good movie. But this one, set in early times, really sucks. if they made a new setting type one, 1990'+ i'd see it. Well, they better put Lolana back in it! :)Where ever you are Lolana, I love you! no wait, i LUST you! lol"
4,Love Kennedy Johnson,Love vampire movies and love Kennedy Johnston. This hit the daily double for me. I am a happy customer! I already had a VHS version. DVD is better.
5,Startling look into the future,"I don't understand some of the critical reviews of this book. The fact is that Grids do exist today and are being used by Research oriented companies. About two dozen companies are already serving clients in the realm of grid computing. Platform Computing, United Devices, and Avaki are just three companies who are helping to create the future of the grid computing. The web succeded because it connected everybody. Until larger grids are contructed for business enterprises I agree that grid computing will not grow. The book does a great job of showing what the future may be like in terms of grid computing. Someday your computing resources will come from your local Grid Computing Company just as you get electricity from your Power Company. How that comes to be is still the ultimate question."
1,Terrible product! Don't waste your money.,"We ordered this product because of the cost, but it wasn't worth even that amount. It never would work properly and you could not understand the voice.If you really think you can't live without this type of product, search around and buy another brand. We had a Phillips for 4 years, but it quit working recently and was not willing to replace it at the $70 cost. You get what you pay for! Sending ours back."
4,Great product,I really love my cookware set. It cleans easily and i love the idea that i can start something on top of the range and finish it in the cookware in the oven. I also was very impressed with the way amazon resolve the matter of the glass top that was damaged in shipment. They contacted me and we were able to resolve the issue quickly and to my satisfaction. I plan on order many more things through amazon as this was the first item i ever purchased on line. I also liked the speed at which i received my items.
3,Flight stick good Website bad.,I got this for battlefield project reality mod. Which turns out most say it is easier to use mice with. It does work great for my purposes and having the dedicated throttle and many! other buttons on the device comes in very handy.For most games you would probably be better off with a cheaper smaller alternative.My main gripe with this is the software that saitek provides. The site for downloading his horrible and it took me ages to get software that worked. I think it may have had to do with the madcatz takeover but I'm not sure.
3,Good so far but some issues though,"I like the X52 but for some reason it will not calibrate the joystick to the center, it is stuck in the uppewr left hand corner.Also, there is no printed manual included, just a dvd and a flyer for the Saitek pedals.In addition, going to the Saitek website to DL game profiles for FSX and Falcon 4.0 is a pain b/c they do not tell you how to install these profiles. They point you to their forum but trying to search their forum is impossible and fruitless.I will update this as soon as I get this thing firgured out."
2,"Looks good, but stick is way too loose","The stick looks really nice.However, the fatal flaw of the whole product is that the stick is way too lose. There's almost no resistance, making it far more difficult to control.Overall, the stick is a downgrade from older products that have a tighter pull."
3,half and half,The system has lots of buttons for programming. This is very appealing. I found the axis control stick very poor . For flying games I found the stick to be unreliable for resolution of the target. No matter what the adjustment in sensitivity it was useless. I ended up going back to my old logitech Extreme 3D Pro. And its worn out. However I combined the throttle side with the 3D Pro using the program disc that came with the Saitek. The program allowed me to have greater funtional abilities within the game. A very good addition to the gamer. All the buttons on the stick are appealing but the axis control is far from ideal.
2,It didn't work with the game I had bought it for.,It did not work with the game I had bought it for. May have been my mistake in purchasing it.
2,cool but crap,"I've used this item for 3 weeks now - programming it was straight forward and time consuming but never held the positions.The integration constantly dropped out forcing you to recalibrate every game and often again right in the middle of play.At first I thought it was cool to not have to use the keyboard for stuff, but as it was so tempermental - I went back to the keyboard...what a waste of $100!"
3,The Best in Tent Camping,"It's a nice reference book, however, since it's only ""The Best in Tent Camping"", it's missing a lot of other areas to camp."
3,Good information but dense and not complete,"I'm not an electrician or engineer, but I consider myself fairly intelligent and didn't mind the challenge of learning something new. Unfortunately this was not the book for me. While Piggot does an admirable job of laying out the basics of how a wind turbine functions and the components involved, this is not a start-to-finish guide to building a wind turbine. For example, there is a chapter dedicated to constructing (or modifying an existing) generator/alternator and a chapter on constructing an appropriate tower, but literally no information on how to mount your generator to the tower. There's information on what you need from the electrical controls to prevent battery damage, but no information on where you could get these controls or how to build them.If you're interested in getting into wind power and have a solid engineering foundation, I'm sure this book would be helpful. For everyone else, you might want to start elsewhere."
3,Parallel to the Apes,This is an helpful book if you want to understand the decent of man.But he is not an expert in this field and he doesn't cover some major areas very well.His title and subsequent text make you think that apes and men aren't directly related. But they are by allrational interpretations of the fossil record. It is worth theprice as a paper back but is seriously dated.
4,LOVE it,The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was b/c it's supposed to be handwashed in order to preserve the seal of the double wall. And the straw makes a kind of whistle noise when I drink from it.
2,"I Used to Love it, but things have changed","I have owned at least 20 of these bottles and my husband and I seldom leave the house without our bottle. BUT, I think I am done. The last four or five bottles we have ordered have had problems. The company is wonderful about replacing defective products, but they've done this three times and what they sent wasn't much better than what I had - Hard to screw on caps- just don't fit perfectly, ice melts faster than the older bottles, the top turning device sticks badly on all the new bottles and that is a huge problem. One of the selling points is being able to close and tote around with you. When the top sticks that's not an option. Now, since I keep everything, I've got plenty of old parts that I've been able to substitute, but that will someday end. I'm afraid until Trudeau Corp. gets quality control in China under control, or does whatever they need to do to make their product wonderful again, I will be looking elsewhere."
1,UGH!!,"These bottles look very nice but they are so impractical for me. Very bulky, the rubber straw is weird to drink from, very difficult to keep clean, and the ice only lasts a couple of hours. The large version is so big! How can I fit it into my bag for work or appts?? I'm sticking with my old favorite (from FlyLady.com) - stainless steel, sleek, and keeps ice even over night! They don't come in colors but they are far, far superior to these plastic ones!!!"
5,Pool and pond netting,This netting is the best since sliced cheese. I don't know why we didn't buy this years ago for all the falling leaves. Sure saves the pool cleaner a lot of work which is me. The fish appreciate it also because it keeps debris from poluting their waters.
2,ok to cover pond but not protect fish,"idea is what is described but didn't work to protect our koi from otters.the netting is small and thin, the otter ripped right through it and got into the pond"
3,Spicy,"These spice jars look great, only problem is the lids do not fit very tightly and probably will affect the quality of the spices over time."
1,Horrible!,"this gun is really cheap plastic. My friend got it and the next day it broke because the cheap plastic trigger broke. Then my dad who is increadible at fixing things fixed it again, and then the next day after that it broke. My friend was so upset he cried. (he's a little smaller).Well my advice to you is don't get this gun. And incredibly good gun however would be the lasersoft 1900."
3,The Kings Privateer,The King's Privateer (Alan Lewrie Naval Adventures)The book was enertaining and gave an interesting insight to the risks for commerical shipping in the far east durning that time peroid.
3,It gets the job done!,"Not your top of the line controller but it gets the job done if its a one man show or a small dj setting. Jus plug it, use one of the 4 settings a forget it. A great value for the price you pay."
1,Don't buy this one!!!!!,"I'm a big fan of Illya Kuriaky, I have all the albums and I'm ""friend"" of the band. This album is the same as the unplugged ""Ninja Mental"" minus one song. So buy the original Mtv unplugged and enjoy this great funk-latin band. if you don't find the original buy it ,the songs are great."
1,"More monks, less author","This book was absolutely, absolutely horrible. Only the rare nugget of interesting or useful information stopped me from flinging it against a wall. Repeatedly.Basically, it contained page after page of meaningless, empty religious-speak. It's presumption that [X] -- whatever [X] happened to be at the time, say an adventuresome spirit, or interest in life or whatever -- was impossible without god or faith was annoying in the extreme.I found myself at the end reacting towards the author the same way that his sons did in one chapter at dinner -- rolling my eyes and snickering at his spouting religious nonsense yet again.If I could give negative stars, the author would owe me a universe."
1,Reprinted in Black and White,I missed the reviews of some of the other books in the Essential X-Men series and was very disappointed when this book arrived to find that it was a reprint in black and white. I'm a fan of these stories but for me they fall flat w/ out the color.
5,GOTTA GET FUZZY!,"'Get Fuzzy' is my favorite comic! This is my third desk-calendar that I've had, and every day is a new laugh!!"
3,Could not pull them up,"Product seems good, but my hands are not strong enough to pull them up - and these are the lightest tension."
5,"Great example of ""Don't judge a book by its cover.""","...because the COVER of the Ace Original 1983 paperback edition really doesn't do the book justice (it's crappy!). I thought I was going to be reading a P.O.S. pulp sci-fi for laughs, and ended up crying at the end, having read the whole book cover to cover in one sitting. If you're a sci-fi fan at all, you'll dig this one. It's great.Funny how it's getting an average of five out of five stars from people who have read it, and yet it's out of print, and used copies are going for pennies."
1,you need a table to add support,"you will need the additional support of a table to use the nine ft. umbrella with this stand. the knobs are plastic and break easily. the recommended 9ft umbrella leans slightly in the stand, ie. wont stay perpendicular. overall, you get what you pay for..."
5,Rare Epic/Sony Version,"Due to the contract dispute that Sons Of The Desert had with Sony Records over The Dixie Chicks releasing ""Goodbye Earl"" which was originally supposed to be done by Sons Of The Desert on their next Sony album, Sons left Sony before the album was officialy released. This version of ""Albuquerque"" is different than the one you'll find on the MCA release ""Change"". I think it will become a collector's item for Sons Of The Desert fans. Both versions are exemplary."
4,The long awaited cd,"I grew up in Italy and always liked Rino Gaetano's singing. Didn't buy record because i heard it on radio.Since here in Australia have been wanting to hear his songs. Decided oo Amazon and "" Bingo"" ! Got double cd with all the songs i wanted to hear. Am very satisfied. Amazon was quick in delivery. Good work!!!!!!!!"
3,Movie,This movie was better when i ws younger but not so much now. I loved the dodge charger in the movie.
5,On target!,"The Remo Controlled Head centered the snare sound as I'd hoped it would. I'm using it on a Pork Pie metal 14"" x 6 1/2"" drum with 30 strand wires and an Aquarian Studio Ring. The head is tuned down giving me a ""fat"", controlled sound that doesn't pierce the listener's ears - very musical and listener friendly. Definitely pleased with the end result!"
3,"Great concept, some flaws","Love the concept of this! It's not very comfortable to hold- it needs a custion or something, and its bulky with no grooves for fingers, I'm 6ft tall, my hand isn't huge but it's proportioned to my body so I think if someone smaller than me would use it they would agree. Also, it just pops, or snaps over your current sprayer, which is great but if your like me, after you pull the hose out and your all done, you kinda just let it retract on its own like its supposed to, we'll every time I do the spray scrubber pops off, pretty annoying to manually retract the hose and seems kind of pointless to keep putting it on when I want to use it. So It just sits there seldom used."
1,Good but is not in production,I tried to order 3 items and all I got was a response that said the product was out of production. I was very disappointed!!!!! I need a replacement. Now I don't have anything to use.
1,Gave me a Headache!,"I am a great fan of Sherlock Holmes, and thus decided to take a gamble buying this series despite the negative reviews about the quality of the remastering. On hindsight, I should have taken the advice offered by all the reviewers who gave a one star rating based on the poor quality of the product.The video quality is very bad indeed. You can see ""shadows"", as if you are having double vision. The picture was also shaky. Sound quality is bad. I had to replay certain scenes and listen intently to make out what the characters were saying. I did not see any evidence of ""remastering"", unless the original version had been trampled on by a herd of rampaging elephants.The DVD gave me a headache, and I stopped trying to watch it after only 10 minutes. At the moment, I am not sure whether I should return this for a refund, or just write off the loss."
1,"Promising series, defective dvd, don't take the risk","I managed to watch only one of the 39 shows presented on this series. The second episode began to fall apart into digital clutter and finally quit playing altogether.This is unfortunate -- the first episode was actually of interest and the series promised many hours of entertainment.As I have learned, to my chagrin -- if there is a quality problem with one dvd or cd, there is a strong likelihood that the others in the production run will have the same issue.In short, there is a reason for the low cost of this item, and one gets what one pays for. Don't count on being lucky like other reviewers -- my recommendation is you avoid this until the company announces that they have fixed the quality problems."
1,The Case Of Inferiority,"Apparently most of the positive reviews for this set are based upon the previous 5 disc release by Mill Creek rather than the 3 disc release by Mill Creek as being reviewed here. Sherlock Holmes would likely call this ""The Case Of Inferiority"" relative to the overall quality of the video and audio. The video quality is ghastly as is the audio quality. A rating of 1 out of 5 is much too generous for this disappointing release of a wonderful series. Two of the three discs will not play at all while the third freezes and goes back to the root menu. Potential purchasers of the 3 disc set are advised to carefully consider the lower ratings by other reviewers prior to making the decision to purchase."
5,Sherlock Holmes - Fantastic,"First of all, I am a major Sherlock Holmes fan. I have nearly all films in my collection. I've watched all 39 of these and they were great. The films have not been re-mastered so there is a little snow in the picture and the sound isn't the best but not bad. I recommend this package of CDs to anyone who really enjoys Sherlock. Each film is about 30 minutes so they fly by. All were written for TV except one. Very enjoyable, you won't be sorry!"
5,New Edition Available,"Just a note: Marvel recently reprinted this book, with a great new cover by Salvador Larrocca, though for some reason the major online bookstores haven't received it (at the time of this review). Unless you are specifically collecting old editions, there is no reason to pay twice the cover price for a used copy."
4,a thoroughly good read,"Once again Joan Vinge has managed to combined intriguing and topical sci-fi (ESP, ancient alien races, complex technologies) within an emotionally satisfying plot. She takes us into strange and powerful alternative moralities that are yet plausible enough for us to connect to them with our own humanity. Like all the best writers, she forces us to look at ourselves and our own civilization through telling a terrific story with well developed characters. Though I think Snow Queen and Summer Queen are the best of her novels I've read, I thoroughly enjoy Cat's brooding and painful coming to terms with himself and hope fervently that Ms Vinge is preparing to send us another entry in this series."
5,Great first of a series,"LOved it, all I can say. The story and plot is very well done and the dialog propels the story onward. I especially liked the action scenes, they were done in a way to get the blood pumping. Gread job**A book I would also recommend is The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. This, the first installment of The Morcyth Saga is a great beginning for a new author. Battles, magic, gods, secret passages and intrigue, all the elements of a classic epic fantasy! Any fantasy reader will enjoy it"
5,excellent !!,This book totally surprised me !! i didnt expect it to be this great! its a excellent story -well written with characters you care about -it has hints of many possible stories too come -and i cant wait for the sequel or anything this author writes!!
4,"Bags, bags, and more bags...","If you're like me, you have those plastic grocery bags all over your house. I love this bag holder. I use most of my bags for pet clean up, so this was great to mount right by the back door for when we go outside for doggy potty breaks. It was easy to mount and holds about 25-30 bags depending on how full you want to stuff it.My only complaint is that I wish it were longer and could hold more bags!"
5,Reckless,I recommended to anyone who hasn't read Hannah Howell work. She is a great author and you won't be disappointed.
1,Bible Cover,The bible cover was not the correct size for the type bible I ordered for my husband. So I am having to return this and I guess take the bible somewhere that I can see the bible covers so I know before I get one that it will fit the bible.
5,Excellent if you like to eat the shells,"I used to eat David's pumpkin seeds, thinking they were pretty healthy, but if you read the note on the nutritional imformation, you find out this: If you eat the shells, you get about 15 times more salt than it claims in the nutritional information.If anything, these Klein seed are a little too low in salt. But they taste great. My family goes through a case every couple weeks."
3,too salty,and thats saying something because i like salt. I had to rinse them briefly then stick them in my dehydrator to redry them. After that they had just a touch of salt left and were perfect. But the shell are pretty tender so you can eat the whole thing and get lots of extra fiber. Except for the salt issue they are very tasty.
5,Peterkin's island is a place to spend time,"I wonder how many people now alive were changed by Peterkin? Although I remember reading books by the ton when I was of an age, it was this book, above all, that made me understand the power of language in the hands of imagination. Perhaps some 32 years later, my mind still finds Peterkin when it stretches for its greatest fancy. It is not just the power of the book itself that is a wonder to me, but rather its power to make people into evangelists for reading. I am firmly convinced that is is a consciousness-changing experience to dwell a month on that island."
4,Very inspiring,"I have had the camera a month and so far it has lived up to its expectations and stated specifications. Using the big LCD display without the battery-saver enabled, I was only able to operate it on a fully charged battery for maybe 20 mins before the battery needed recharging, so if you were bringing the camera to an outside event and you like the LCD display, you will need to buy another spare battery..."
4,good buy.. no sound however,"It is comfortable and easy to grip. The pictures are outstanding. It adjusted well to poor indoor lighting conditions. The movie format produces great pictures as well. I have friends with 2.1Mpixel cameras and the movies are not as good a quality. The only downfall is that the camera doesn't have any sound features, which is disappointing."
3,priced good,"just doesn't last as long, not as strong. If you could bring real perfume down on price, that is all i want."
5,WHAT BASE ?????!!!!!!,"BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!Misleading representation,as photo shows umbrella in a stand,no where in buying information is it stated a stand is not included.... Only after buying this as a housewarming gift that was sent out of state, was I made aware that a stand was not included in purchase.. Contacting Amazon I was informed the information was included in editorial reviews,which it was, however after reading the buying info. wouldn't one assume that it contained all information necessary about the product!!???"
1,"Cheap Umbrella, Cheap Performance","I purchased this umbrella for my deck in the Northeast, as a replacement for a much more expensive one that had lasted 5 or 6 years but had developed a few holes and wear.I've had this one for a year, and it's now heading for the trash.As described, it arrived in two pieces and was never straight. (The same problem others have described.) It simply never looked like it was sturdy, and within a couple of months one of the umbrella ribs was broken.Now, in a mild wind, the umbrella snapped into two pieces right around the area where they were screwed together.I expect items, even ones that are reasonably cheap like this umbrella, to go together well and be reasonably sturdy. I made a mistake with this product.I would definitely advise against buying this unless you need a cheap umbrella that will last one season, and you don't mind something that looks pretty cheap."
1,"Good idea, but bad quality","The idea of the rack is pretty neat, I bought it, installed it in a minute, and loved it the first day. I only put 5 small plastic bottles of spice in the rack, after the first day, every night it would break your nerve by popping open with no warning!I first thought I overloaded it, so I bought a new one, and put almost practically nothing in the rack just to ""keep its mouth shut."""
4,very compact and convinient,"Good quality, easy to carry, clean and adjust. My grandchildren used to take it on vacation trips and sport games."
2,This is for photographers,"I ordered this after searching for books on data visualization/infographics. Felice Frankel is a well known expert in the field, however this book is about her photography, not graphics. Be warned! Beautiful book but not what I wanted."
2,Not what I expected,"This book is not a coffee table book of Frankel's amazing pictures, it is basically a textbook of her techniques. The pictures are not the focus. The focus is on instruction- creation, exposure, color, composition, and the like. I'm not a photographer, and really couldn't care less about that stuff. I just wanted a book of her work. If I had looked at this book in a bookstore first, I would not have bought it."
1,I should have believed the reviews!!,"I bought this clock, after reading and ignoring the reviews. I thought, quite arrogantly ""These people can't get their clocks to work, but I'm sure with a little patience and after reading the directions, I'll have no problem. After all, a company wouldn't outright sell so many clocks that don't work, right?!"" EEERRRT. I bought 3 of these clocks. 1 works, 2 don't. I've followed the instructions--even the one's that are really quite ridiculous: Use only name brand batteries that are fully charged and within X weeks from the expiration date-DONE, hang the clock on an eastern bearing wall-DONE, wait 48 hours--DONE, hang the clock x-feet from another clock--DONE, and the list goes on! I tried to call their support number (posted on their website, and on a card that comes with the clock--and the number doesn't work!! (608-782-1610). THESE CLOCKS SUCK!! Don't waste your time or money!"
3,Easy to set but annoyingly loud,"I put in a battery, selected my time zone, manually set the time close and hung it on the wall. The next day it was synchronized with the earth. I noticed today it 'ticks' with every second. Not a good thing when you like silence."
3,Good clock,"With the DST issues this year, this clock was annoying... I have two of them, and one worked (updated) and the other didn't. Now it's fine, but I think the automatic setting thing may be overrated."
1,What time is it? Time to take out the trash with this clock in it.,"From the reviews I have read from other La Crosse purchasers, it seems about 50% of all La Crosse clocks are busted. I am on the busted half.The Big Wall clock from this company my girlfriend gave me had the second hand busted which she managed to fix just before giving it to me on Christmas. Apparently it was rattling around in the face.The first time I purchased this clock (the WT-3102S) it had some pretty ugly wear marks on it and didn't work. At all. So I returned it. Got the new clock and it worked great, except for the second hand. No go. I tried fixing it recently by jiggling it, and poking it like a dead rat. Well, apparently I pushed it over the edge and it hasn't worked since.I just bought a different brand with better reviews (plus it's digital). I will never buy La Crosse clocks again. If you buy this thing, it's your own fault."
5,pure non-mainstream music,"this is 100% pure non-mainstream music all the way. no idiot grammy winners here. if you're looking for independent music, stop here, but if you're looking for mainstream, leave, because you will not find it."
5,Strategic Planning & Performance Management,This book has made Strategic Planning easier to understand and impliment.It is highly applicable to any size business. This book helped us enormously to focus on what is critical to the success of our business.
4,Blackie at sea,"This was my second Blackie Ryan book and I found that I enjoyed it far more than the first which was The Bishop and the missing L Train. This one kept me on the each of seat and page turning, trying to guess what had happened, along with all the other enjoyable characters kept me going untill the final page. A first rate book and a new author to read had me doing handstands for joy."
2,Mediocre self help book,"I give this book two stars for effort and its Christian perspective, but he reverts to the ""forgive at all costs"" mentality. Some things aren't forgivable, nor should people be expected to do so. This may lay an additional burden on people who are suffering, trivializes their injuries, and it gives the abuser an out. Still, a decent effort. Might be helpful in addition to counseling from a minister"
2,"Oxford Cushions are okay, not great","I returned my cushions. The natural color was too stark. The single welt was not nearly as nice as a box welt. The cushion thickness was a little too flimsy. If you are on a tight budget, these are fine, but if you want something that looks really sharp, I would pass on these."
5,MRS. BREWER HAS DONE IT AGAIN,"Anne Brewer has written another book that has the power to change your life. She writes in a clear, descriptive manner that makes it easy to understand and apply to oneself. I have read all of her books and she just keeps getting better."
1,Flimsy,"The bowls itself is fine but the base/hanger is super flimsy. If you fill it with water it bends. In my case, the dog getting a drink busted the weld on the hanger the first week. Disappointing."
2,Not so great...,"The only story I finished in its entirety (and actually enjoyed) was the one written by Karen Marie Moning. She has not disappointed me yet! The others, however, successfully kept me bored!"
3,Trumpet players,"Good band, mediocre arrangements and a ""so so"" trumpet player heavy on the loud, brassy side, definitely not in the Harry James/Bunny Berigan class."
5,Makes a great gift!,"I bought this for my boyfriend who is in a neo-soul/r&b band, and he thought it was great!"
2,Disappointed in this DVD,"I thoroughly enjoy salsa, and enjoy learning from DVD's and tapes. The title and reviews of this product suggest one will learn great things about this lovely dance. Unfortunately, it is not clearly stated that this is for salsa rueda, not salon style or club salsa. Although the moves are nifty and presented in a reasonable fashion, rueda requires the expected step to be called out, somewhat in the latin version of square dancing. So if you are looking to turn your date around the floor in your own style, leading with non verbal ques, this is not your DVD."
4,motivational rhetoric for the breastfeeding advocate!,"Already over ten years old, Gabrielle Palmer's eye-opening book pioneered some of the breastfeeding advocacy arguments being used by activists today.Links obstacles placed in the way of breastfeeding mothers to the devaluation of the motherhood role which occurred during the growth of the industrial revolution.Detailed history of breastfeeding and wet-nursing. Narrates the history of the Nestle scandal, in empathy with 3rd World perspective. A strong advocate for the rights of all babies to be nourished from the breast.Counters anti-breastfeeding sentiment in today's society. Explains away sexuality myths which hinder women from breastfeeding in public. Terrific book for the breastfeeding professional who wants to boost their arguments!"
1,RIP OFF,"WELL, 2 WEEKS LATER I FINALLY RECIEVED AN ENGLISH SPEAKING BARNEY SEVERAL E MAILS LATER ,NO SORRY OR ANYTHING I SENT THIS BACK SECURED BECAUSE I KNEW THEY WERE A RIP OFF ...BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AND BE TAKEN THATS ALL I HAVE TO SAY THERE GOES MY DAUGHTERS EASTER PRESENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!CUSTOMER SATISFACTION HUH ..SCAM ...."
2,Straight aerobics w/5 min of hand weights,"This is about 30 min of Denise Druce leading with Melissa & Donna (2 thin blonds) in the usual grey carpet & colored basement looking place. The sound/lighting is good, not high production, but does the trick, only one or 2 camera angles all from the front. The backup dancers have very little enthusiasm & a bit stiff. Music is the usual fare.Warm-up - 5 minAerobics - 15 min90s style moves, there is no dancing here except a simple chasse & mambo for a few seconds. The usual 90s style aerobics.Aerobics w/hand weights - 5 minmore moving with the feet with hands moving to do simple bicep curls, etc.Cool-down - 5 minhas some good stretching like yoga side angle pose.I don't like straight aerobics & thought since had the word DANCE in it it had more dance moves since there were 2 reviews on an online dvd rental site saying they enjoyed it.The dvd series website is fitessentials net"
4,"No his best, but a keeper","Jerry made this book for people who don't like to read, but love to learn. Information is all over inside, based on need to know. So he educates you by his 5 groups, which lessons can be applied to other areas though not mentioned in those areas of the book. Great resource."
3,Not a Collection of Interesting Facts,"When I purchased the ""Micropedia of World Facts"", I was expecting a small book filled with interesting information and little- known facts about countries, people, and history. However, I received a small but thick book containing alphabetical listings for such exciting topics as ""furniture"", ""fungi"", ""nutrition"", and (listen to this) ""microwaves"". The book listed many countries, but with only basic information such as population, major cities, and important national figures. There were no maps to accompany the country listings, and no interesting facts.The three stars are for the high quality of the paper, for the book being easy to use, and for the great index. This is a good reference guide for a wide array of information, but is not nearly as good as many other books of facts."
4,great,Product arrived in orginal box and great condition. There was some confusion with shipment but it all worked out.
5,THE best smelling stuff!,"I've been sampling a wide range of very expensive fragrances and ran across this fragrance by accident. Surprisingly, this is THE best smelling one I've found (and I've spent hundreds of dollars on perfume). I will continue to order this over and over again. It's a wonderful, uncommon fragrance, with a fruity lightness blended with a creamy delectableness not found in other perfumes."
4,Beautiful and strong perfume for special occasions,"I received a sample of this perfume and had to have it. I almost paid full price for it, then found it for such a bargain here at Amazon. The bottle of this perfume is so pretty and mermaid-esque, and the fragrance is excellent. I love reading about perfumes and finding special perfumes to wear, and this is one that I save for special occasions. It is strong, but wears close to the skin, and the vanilla note is really sexy."
2,"Great idea, poor construction",I orginally bought this product to use as a tool to help my autistic son. I thought this would work well as a visual reminder. I set it up so that he would use his personal hygiene time wisely before school. Once I learned how to operate it (it was challenging) it was indeed helpful to my son. My problem is that this product lasted somewhere around 6-9 months and then quit working. When I bought it I paid much more for it than what Amazon is asking. I like the concept but I don't believe the manufacturer has all the bugs worked out yet. Back to the drawing board!
4,traffic light kids timer,"I purchased the timer to help with time outs. I've seen it used on the show supernanny and was curious. It's a little complicated to program and learn the screens but once you read up and practice a little it a great timer. The kids love being able to watch the timer and know when time out is soon to be over. We also use it in races and cleaning up. For example, I will tell them ""lets set the timer and see if we can get this room clean before the red light comes on. Even my three year old has not problem joining in for the race."
1,Concept is great but the design is poor.,"This product concept is a great idea; however, I believe that that both the software and hardware were designed by inexperienced engineers. I am sorry if this is not helpful, I just don't want to waste my time discussing all of this product's shortcomings. The biggest complaint though was that to even change the countdown time it is far too tedious and requires you to step through several layers in the menu to make even simple changes. In the end, we simply never wanted to go through the trouble required to use this product and it sat on a a shelf until I finally sold it on e-bay for one third what I paid for it."
3,"Great concept, unfortunate execution","This product concept is great, and when I take the time to set it up, it completely solves any problems we have with transitions. My son loves it and asks for it. Unfortunately, it is a huge pain to set up. Every time you want to change the amount of time on the timer, you have to go through a painful process with lots of button pushing, because you can't set the time without setting all of the options for sound effects and lights. The buttons are hyper-sensitive so sometimes after pressing the buttons 15 times you end up with a ""double-click"" that you didn't intend and have to start all over. If you always use the same time (5 minutes, for example) then it's no problem. Otherwise you might consider a kitchen timer. It would be a lot easier to use."
1,very dissapointed with seller,"The item was purchased from NorAm International Partners, Inc.through Amazon. The packaging material inside the box was torn from a previous purchaser. The item appeared to have been returned previously due to a defect and then resold as new. Product did not work. Very disappointed with NorAm International Partners, Inc. and disappointed with Amazon for dealing with them. Returned product for a refund. As listed in other reviews, operation is not intuitive... would not purchase again."
3,You need a doctorate to program this thing!,"Once you figure out how to program it, it's very useful. I used it for dinner time as my kids would spend eternity chewing. It helped keep dinner time to a reasonable amount of time, but then the things I programmed somehow got deleted & I just couldn't figure out how to program it again; maybe it was dropped too many times (or maybe I was).. either way, it collects dust now. It shouldn't be so hard to program! If you can master what I couldn't, then this timer will help the kids stick to their tasks. Sort of recommend this."
2,Loved it while it worked,"I used this in my classroom 40-50 times over approximately 2-3 months before it stopped working. Numbers appear on the screen, but it doesn't countdown the way that it is supposed to, nor does it keep the time correctly. Thinking that perhaps the charge on the batteries was running out, I changed the batteries multiple times, but the problem persisted. I kept the timer in a cabinet behind my desk and brought it out only when it was in use, so I know that the issue was not middle school students experimenting with it and breaking it. Regarding the ease of programming, which seems to have caused issues for others: once I learned how to set it, it was quite easy to use. My students loved both the visual reminder of how much time they had left as well as the sounds."
3,What a pain,"Setting this thing is a complete drag. I can never remember how to do it, and I do not quite understand why it should be so much more difficult and less intuitive than setting any other timer - clock - alarm.My first VCR was easier than this to set up. As others have mentioned, if you set it wrong, you have to pull the batteries and start over.Once it's working, it is a great tool for teaching children time management."
2,"Worked great, until it didn't","I love this timer, I love the way it works, and it does wonders for my kids in being able to see when the time is almost up. We used it a ton. Then suddenly it started malfunctioning. We had to restart it several times, and now it won't even work long enough to use it, even if you do restart it, and we have only had it for a few months. I think it is a great idea, and if it didn't keep breaking I would give it 5 stars."
4,"Great, but not perfect.","I teach 3rd Grade. This thing is PERFECT if you have a routine that lasts the same amount of time every day. For example, two times a day my class does some practice activities that last 11 minutes. I literally have to say NOTHING and they already know to get ready to correct their work when the lights starts flashing red. In terms of its positive effect on my class management, I probably save a good 3-4 precious minutes each day as a result of using the Time Tracker. I give it my highest teacher recommendation for using it for DAILY ROUTINIZED activities.The problem with this thing is that it's a pain to program. It's not so much that it's difficult, but that it's not worth it considering the disturbance it would cause, as it is quite noisy to reprogram. The memory only allows for one 100% programmable slot (the other programmable slot is a little restricted). The TTVC would have gotten 5 stars if it had more memory slots for programming."
4,Love it!,"First of all -- I didn't find the programming to be any more difficult than programming a VCR or a digital clock. I only had to look at the instructions once and I've been able to change it plenty of times since then.I do wish that there was a way you could save more than two settings for time, because having to go in and change it every time you want to change the duration is a little annoying. It would be really nice if there were maybe four or five presets that you could use... like 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, etc. I also think it would be nice if you could start it off on red and then end on green instead of having to do it the other way around... so when we're ""cooling down"" or at bedtime/naptime -- I could use the red and then have it flip to green to signal that it's okay to get up/play.Other than that, it's working well. It made bedtime routine a breeze last night with my 2 1/2 year old son. :)"
3,"Ok, not great.","Kids like the colors and can anticipate the various countdown stages. Like many reviewers have noted, it is challenging to change the countdown settings without referring back to the manual. For the most part we use this only to time meals where the amount of time for each stage does not vary from night to night.Worst feature is that only a couple of weeks after purchase the retailer dropped the price by 50%. For this new $13 price I would recommend this product. Probably not worth the $25 I paid.Good idea running poor software (limited and difficult programming).Hope this helps you."
4,Great Idea,"All in all I was really excited about this product.. all the research I did said it was very effective. I have a child with ADHD, ODD, and an extremely high IQ.. he needs structure and to be challenged constantly to be able to stay on task. It however did not work for him, he could careless about the timer and continued to do things his way.. Im not saying it doesn't work, Im just saying it didn't work with my child."
1,CAUTION TO BUYER,"Other reviewers have mentioned this, and I have just run into the same experience myself. The filter being sold by Crawford's Superstore is NOT a HMC UV(C) filter. It is an HMC UV(N) filter. The N model filter is an asian market model and is made with inferior components. If you look on (insert name of popular auction site here) you will see that the UV(N) filters are about 25% cheaper than the UV(C) filters, so this is a bait and switch operation.I can't comment on the filter yet because I haven't opened the packaging. As soon as I saw what was going on I immediately contacted the seller and have yet to receive a response. It could be a good filter, but I wanted to warn people that what is advertised here is not what you will receive. If the seller takes care of the problem then I will update my review."
2,Item not as advertized,"I specifically ordered the Hoya HMC filter. The Hamazon store tag says it is HMC, but the filter is not HMC. One can buy this on eBay for $10. Not happy with the experience. I submitted feedback to seller, but it was removed... hmmm is this an Amazon related store front??"
5,A excellent desk reference,"Ashenden covers many of the finer points of the VHDL language including differences between '87 and '93 implementations. I have used suggestions from his book with Cadence, Synopsys, Altera, Xilinx, and Model Tech tools for several years without any problems(all source code for the book is available at his web site). In addition, this is one of the few books to handle text and file I/O adequately, a real necessity for test bench design. Along with Kevin Skahill's and Douglas Smith's(dual Verilog/VHDL coverage, real handy) books it's definitely in the top 3."
1,Spots,"I can understand the applause for this set, which I purchased as a gift. However, when I examined the plates, I noticed that 6/8 of them had spots on the upper surface, of varying obviousness. In one case, a small gouge was present. There is simply no excuse for this lack of quality control, which had previously been reported for the Italian pattern from the same manufacturer. As there were no complaints for this item, I thought I would be relatively safe.Unfortunately, Amazon no longer directly sells this set, so I could not get an exchange and try, before shipping the defective set back, to swap items between the two full sets to create a new one that wasn't defective.Now I have no gift to give, time is short, and I am most unhappy."
1,Not for families of suicide victims,"This book may be useful from a clinical perspective, but I definitely don't recommend it if you are someone who is trying to ""make sense"" of a loved one's suicide. At one point the author actually says something like, ""a sensitive and astute person can recognize the signs of suicide and prevent it."" I thought this was a very insenstive statement, as it seems to place blame for a person's suicide on their loved ones! It is also innacurate, as many people who have lost loved ones to suicide can attest to, for even if a person shows signs of being suicidal, you cannot force someone to get help if they won't accept it. Having said this, this book may be useful for people who are studying the subject objectively, and in fact it seems like this is the intended audience."
5,My Dad's Album,"So excited to see this!!! This is my dad's group. LITERALLY! He was in it lol. Great album, great music. yay dad! <3 I wish I could find it in the original album form to frame it for him. Thanks to the post above for support even after all these years."
1,use it less than a month it started leaking air.,use it less than a month it started leaking air. and i ended up throwing it away.
3,the song is tight,"this groove puts me in the frame of mind of Stevie Wonder style era late 70's early 80's. problem for me is that Omarion ain't got the voice to knock this out Proper. Vocally he sounds like he is emulating former Lead Singer of Hi Five Tony Thompson. ""Entourage"" to me is the best song that justin Timberlake,Janet Jackson, Beyonce&other Acts who aspire to make Dance Music didn't do,but dude is MIA in the Vocal Department to me. but this Groove can't be denied."
2,Corrected track listing,"There are 44 tracks on this CD but only 37 are noted in the track listing since the manufacturer omitted listing tracks 26 - 32 which are the Little Preludes for W. F. Bach (26 - BWV 924 in C Major, 27 - BWV 925 in D Major, 28 - BWV 926 in D minor, 29 - BWV 927 in F Major, 30 - BWV 928 in F Major, 31 - BWV 930 in G minor, 32 - BWV 931 in A minor). After these, the tracks listed as 26 through 37 actually correlate to CD tracks 33 through 44. Note: BWV 929, the little prelude for W. F. Bach in G minor, is not contained on this CD."
1,Description WRONG,"Like another person wrote, this did not sing the I love you song and Everyone is special like the description says. It sings Twinkle Twinkle and some ""Mr Star"" song we've never heard. We were VERY DISSAPPONTED.This toy is VERY VERY LOUD and not appropriate for bedtime like I wanted it for. My baby likes night lights so I thought this would be good but it gets pressed accidentally during sleep & wakes the neighborhood."
3,satisfied,"I play contemporary violin on our church worship team. In the past, I have had to either leave my fiddle on the floor in its case or bring it back and forth with me between the music and preaching. The price of the Ingles violin stand was worth a try. It takes only moments to open up and fold out. It is sturdy enough to protect my Hornsteiner and it doesn't clash with my white electric violin. The only drawback is that it is easy to mix up the tightener for the bow holder and the tightener for the neck support for the violin itself. I have almost banged my bow on the floor when I went to adjust the violin holder and ended up loosening the bow holder instead. (Good thing for carpeting.) The stand isn't top heavy, one of my concerns. So far it has been stable. And my violin looks sweet in it, like an art display."
5,Love it,Cheap great stand that does its job! Makes me want to play 24/7 because its just right there.Great gift for anyone who plays and doesnt have one. it will instantly become their best present.
5,Best Millet on the Internet,We have 10 babies and over the years we have been buying Millet from many distributors. This Millet is by far the freshest and most consistant that can buy.
1,Probably the worst movie I have ever seen.,"The only reason I watched this film, was because I am friends with one of the cast. Poor guy!!! This is a mess, no wonder its never really been released and even the DVD is virtually impossible to buy anywhere apart from Amazon. (not necessarily a compliment guys)The gore and violence is laughably bad and the incestuous ending is deeply offensive and makes no sense at all.But none of the movie makes any sense. It also looks cheap and is poorly edited. Actors never really know how a movie is going to turn out, but did anyone read the script? The final scene ---yikes. !!!!!!!!"
2,What the heck is going on?,"What can I say about Red Canyon? Well, its a confusing mess. It does start off well though. The first 30 minutes of the movie are full of suspense, mystery, ominious scenery, and good acting. I was intrigued and wanted to learn about the bad guys and what transpired in the cave at the red canyon. Unfortunately, the rest of the story is told in brief blurry flashbacks which only serve to aggravate and further confuse the viewer. From what I could glean from the annoying flashbacks, the movie seems to end with a disturbing incestious twist but by that time I was too bored and annoyed to really care."
3,Works OK,For the most part this box works just like it says. The one exception is odor. I can't even get 2 weeks out of one re-fill. I have one cat. I clean solid wastes out every couple days. But the odor still over takes my condo.For that reason I will probably end up going back to a regular litter box.
3,Yey for lazy! Yey for clean!,"Great product for those of us who dont like to scoop the box every day. Not a great product if you are on a tight budget as the refill cartridges are spendy. All in all I was very happy with the Scoop Free box, it was tidy, kept the cat box smell away and the cats liked to watch it do its thing (and that was pretty amusing). However one of my cats has a ""issues"" and will only use a box with super fine sand. ::::sigh::: my vet recommended that I stop fighting it and just use a regular box and go back to scooping. However, if this had not happened, I would be a happy scoop free customer forever."
3,Smells,"Loved the tray but I am allergic to the perfume of the litter and my condo smelled really badly of cat pee after 5 days which is way shorter than advertised. They have recently brought out some unperfumed litter, but I suspect the smell of cat pee would be even stronger. I might try it with clay based litter as the actual litter tray is awesome."
1,Hate the litter box,This turned out to be the biggest waste of money I've spent in a long time. If you use the metal permanent tray the urine doesn't get absorbed by the crystals and there is an overpowering smell of ammonia in my utility room. I have been undergoing surgery for cancer and have had relatives taking care of me and I suppose out of politeness they never mentioned this stupid litter box. Since I am now taking care of it myself I have discovered my stupidity in buying the darned thing. It's too late to send it back and besides that I don't believe UPS or USPS would let me put it in their delivery system.
3,It takes a little time,"I have used this box for about six months. My first impression was that it was the best automatic litter box out there. I was wrong. The scooping part is fine, but the cardboard container is not good. I have two cats, one male and one female. After about a week, the odor gets pretty strong and the urine soaks through the bottom of the box. It not only went through the box, but the piece of carpet under it, and the permanent carpet and pad. I wouldn't mind paying the high prices for the cartridges if they actually worked. I'm only getting about a week out of the cartridge before the bottom is wet. As much as I hated the Littermaid's breaking down, and having to spend more time on maintenance, I never had to replace a whole room of carpeting when the Littermaid was in that room. I just ordered an older model LM9000 Littermaid. The new Littermaid ""improved"" model is the most expensive one yet, and the worst one they have ever sold. That one went back to Petsmart after two days."
5,Great Product,"This thing is awesome! It has performed above the my expectations. Ensure you change to trays as directed, but it does a superb job of cleaning the litter box. I have two cats and they both use the box without any issues."
1,Not worth the time and money,"This item was pretty good a year or so ag when I purchased it from Petsmart. But recently it has been malfunctioning a lot! It lost the metal squares that cling to the magnets so that it raises and lowers, the outer teeth to the comb are easily bent, and it does stink often. I am sad that not only did I pay over 100 dollars for this bu then have to spend 16 dollars every other week to replace the litter. It is a money pit and I am searching for a replacement!"
2,not for multiple cat house holds,"im disappointed, at first i was exited to use it but now i have to clean it out every single day, even though i have 2 litter boxes and both seem to get used. The crystals dont soak up the pee that well, i know this because when i went to clean the cartridge there was green stuff at the bottom which was pee, also the crystals don't mask the odors that well, it helps a little bit seeing as how i have 3 male cats (one 4 month old, one 6 month old, and one 1 year old) and there is no ammonia smell, but there there is a poop smell."
4,Different to original,"We bought this to replace our original due to it getting really noisy and rake getting crusty, we have had it for 2-3 yrs already. The new one does not have a button to manually initiate the raking and also in the construction noticed extra two screws in the top in the rear which makes it less water tight. We used to be able to rinse it down with the hand shower but now have to be wary of water seepage.Otherwise still prefer it to te old scoop and shake with litter dust floating around."
3,Ive had one of these for 2yrs,Ive had one of these for 2 yrs and the only compaint i have is the tongs keep breaking off. Ive added all the attachment they recommended to keep this from happening but to no avail. im on my 3rd set of tongs/prongs.
5,Excellent litter box,"I was a bit skeptical about this item but it's a godsend, no more litter tracking the house, no odors and best of all, no cleaning the box several times a day! We have 2 large Maine Coon cats and their waste is also large, this unit cleans it up and keeps it under wraps so there are no strong smells. It's such a relief not having to clean the box every day and then dispose of the waste, and the house smells cleaner. It is a bit pricey but I save over $30 dollars by purchasing it at Amazon, the nearest store had it for $178+tax."
1,This thing sucks,"I have one cat, and as soon as he went you could smell it several rooms away, they expect you to be able to use the same box for 2 weeks, that's crazy it can't handle a single day from 1 kitten.Do not buy this unit."
1,worst investment ever.,"Pretty much its a complete waste of money, It makes a huge mess the cardboard leaks, crystals suck and its overpriced. I would not recommend it to any one. Back to the old litter box."
5,Works great for me.... should have gotten this years ago.,"I am a former Littermaid user. That unit's gears died after 3 years of use. It was a decent automatic litter box, but this is so much better. With the crystal litter, there is no dust, no smell, and minimal noise. We have two small persians who share this box, and they took to it without a problem. Each fill of the litter box lasts 3-4 weeks.The trick is to stir and evenly distribute the crystals once a week or two so one area does not get saturated. Also scoop out the poop under the lid once every 1-2 weeks. Still a lot less mess/ maintenance than the Littermaid."
2,Not worth the money.,I purchased this litter box for my two average sized cats a few months ago. The product works fairly well but I have some major issues with it. First the claims for the lifespan of the cartridges are incorrect. I can use a cartridge for about 7-9 days. So I use about four a month which costs about $40 a month. I'd rather spend the money on something else. The litter box requires a specific amount of light to work which is very annoying as far as placement. I have to leave a light on most of the day and it's in front of a window! The litter is almost exclusively available on the internet and not cheap. I haven't had too many problems with function and am still using the box. I tried using a conventional box along with it and the cats quit using the automatic box. So I'm not sure I made a wise investment and I'm still paying every month.
2,ScoopFree,"It is efficient to ensure that odors do not linger in the room, however it does not stay clean, and the scraper is covered in feces after even a week... I don't look forward to cleaning it!"
3,Great product for a young cat.,"I was so excited to get this product. However, my older cat could not adjust to such a big change from clay regular cat box to a self cleaning crystal litter. I was sad to let this one go. But if you have a young cat, I recommend giving this product a try."
3,"ok, but...","This product is convenient, but the trays don't last as long as they say they are supposed to. I have one cat and the tray starts smelling after 2 weeks. So, it is actually more expensive, initially and long term, than a plain old regular litter box and litter. I also hate the ""crystal"" litter because my cat's paws end up wet after she urinates and tries to cover her mess. I do enjoy the self-cleaning aspect though!"
3,Ehhhh,"It took about a week for the smell to take over the room. I like the fact that you don't have to do much and it's clean for my cat, but the smell really is too much. It's basically the same thing as putting the turds into a bucket on the side of the litter box. I still have a week to go until the 30 days is up...and at 19 bucks for litter I am using that whole month :o) Other than that, it's great"
2,Disgusting!,"I have been using the ScoopFree Litterbox for over 8 months now, and it is the most disgusting pan I have every owned. I replace the cartridges every week, even though they supposedly last for a month, and it still stinks up the entire second floor of my house. The crystals do not work nearly as well as they should. They soak up the urine but just stay drenched and smelly. It doesn't even get a chance to work on the poop, as it's pushed under the lid after 20 minutes. This things is going in the dumpster. What a wast of money! Some things really are too good to be true... (sigh...)"
3,Review Scoop Free,"I think the product is fine, I am still in the trial period.Two things stand out and hopefully the designers will take notice1) the litter is pretty expensive, some one will come out with a clone if this thing catches on.2) this is a problem beyond money - the solid matter often gets trapped behind the rake. This requires manual intervention. When I called the company they blamed the way the cat did its business and why solid matter could fall behind the rake. I think this is a design issue and can be resolved (put metal behind the rake and squeeze tight so it crumbles and gets out)Overall it is a great product, however, my reason for a 3* is that I do want it to be totally automatic....."
2,DON'T BUY IT!,"A few months ago, my girlfriend and I adopted a 2nd cat. We got tired of scooping their poop so we've decided to go with something automatic (who has the time to clean cat's poop anyway?). So after a few weeks of use, I don't know if it's because our cats are special or what because they poop a ton! This box gets filled in no time. I feel like we need to change the cartridge and litter every week to keep up. I think it's more designed for super small mini cats.At times the rake will drag the poop across the bottom of the tray and mushes it across the bottom. The poop eventually dries up on the rake producing the ultimate smell we were trying to avoid (you guess it, cat poop). Anyway, we're going to throw this baby in the dumpster and switch back to regular litter boxes.Even after getting this box, it felt like we had to do more work and it did not cover the smell. So if you have a small cat, maybe it will work for you, but if you have multiple cats, stay away!That's my 2 cents!"
1,Smells worse than a regular box.,This is not worth the money. I have a kitten and I live in a house not an apartment it smells up our house after about two days of replacing the cartridge. You can't see it but you sure can smell it and it is disqusting. I can't believe I was dumb enough to really believe that this would work. I'm going back to the old fashion way....I never had an odor problem like I do with this I just hate to clean it out. Waste of money.
4,Works Great,"This product works pretty much like it says it will. The product itself works pretty good for me, but the litter cartridges haven't been lasting as long as expected. I only have 1 cat, but it seems like I need to change the cartridge every 2 weeks or so."
1,Cats are now traumatized,"I really wanted this to work. I really did.My cats absolutely hated this product. They refused to use it; primarily because of the noise the motor makes (and it is loud). The rake was also disappointing as it did a poor job of scooping , and what it did it did not fully scoop it into the tray. I also found the smell to be rather bad for extremely light use. You should know it's also a very large box, much bigger then originally expected.Again, I really really wish this would have worked. I think the design needs one more good revision, and maybe some cats with more open attitude to new changes.In the process of returning this item for a refund."
1,STINKS!!!! don't buy it!!!,"is not fair that i have to give this product 1 star, it should get none!!we got this litter box because i got pregnant and my doctor told me not to clean my cats' litter box, so it sounded like a good idea... we tried it for a month and we're returning it because of the smell... the refill doesn't last a month like they say, we've been changing it every week, but before the end of the week all the nausea and throwing up from the pregnancy is being triggered by the stinky crystals, and as a bonus, the trace of the crystals is all over my carpet!!!"
4,"Wow, what a good product!",After purchasing three automatic litter boxes from another company - all of which broke down in a short time - I purchased a Scoop Free litter box. What a difference. There is virtually no odor. The motor is adequate for the job it has to do and is reasonably quiet. The cartridges are expensive but worth every penny. I am so grateful for this product and hope I have not jinxed myself by saying how great it is.
3,sloped waste cover causing some problems,"So far this is working great for one of my cats. I love the hood (I can't believe littermaid hasn't stepped up to complete with it). I read comments about the litter trays leaking, so I just put a doggy potty pad underneath as a just in case. Another positive is that it is much quieter then the littermaid. I didn't even hear it at night, whereas I used to wake up when the littermaid went off.The problem I am having is that my other cat does not turn around in the litter. So she is stepping in and going and the urine is hitting the angled waste cover, which slopes away from the litter. Not a good situation. If only it was sloped the other direction it would just flow back in. Not sure how to encourage her to turn around, so this may be a dealbreaker."
3,Not odor free,"I have had this self-cleaning litter box in place for one week, used by one cat with average ""output."" The last three days I've noticed a residual odor, which is especially unpleasant since there is a 20-minute lag before the waste is swept away. Overall, I'm disappointed."
2,"Good, but has problems",I have two cats and have to change the box at least once a week because the coated cardboard box the litter is in gets soaked through. I also have not found a mat to put in front of it that works effectively to stop the litter crystals from being spread ALL over the house. And they hurt when you step on them barefoot!I'm going to hold on to it in hopes they fix the box but am replacing it for now. It really does work great as far as the self cleaning part goes. It just costs to much to change it so often.
3,My Cat didn't like it.,"Product works, yet my cats did NOT like the feel of the crystals. My one cat even sat outside of it and leaned her butt into it as not to walk on the crystals. Needless to say she missed so I went back to the old Arm & Hammer and problem solved. Also...the crystals didn't seem to LAST as long as the company stated they do. I was changing more often than stated and thus spent more money then I antisipated.Good Luck"
4,Catbox review,This litterbox works great and is very quiet. My only problem with it is its size. Bigger than I had expected and does not fit into the place I wanted to put it. Other than that it is great. I have two cats and they had no problem adjusting to the box. I change the litter after every 60 or 70 uses. which is about every 3 weeks.
2,"Expensive to operate, not as described","This product works OK, but not as described. Refuse area is too small and has to be emptied manually every 3 days. I have 2 kittens and the litter only lasts 1 week before getting really smelly and needing to be replaced. I've purchased the forever tray from ebay and am buying the litter separately to try to cut down on the cost. It's still an expensive option. The crystal litter does work better than clay litters at controlling odor. If you have the time to scoop daily, crystal litter in a regular box would be the way to go. This box makes it a little more convenient, but is really not worth the cost."
4,Got the Scoopfree plus the Litter-Bagger disposal system,"I have owned Littermaids in the past and this is definitely a MUCH better built machine, and much more quiet too. I (as many) was concerned about the expense of the refills and how bulky they are to throw away so I started looking for alternatives and ended up getting the Litter-Bagger here on Amazon. http://www.amazon.com/Litter-Bagger-Scoopfree-Replaces-disposable-crystal/dp/B00AG0C066So, instead of the ""turds"" just piling up at one end of the tray, they fall through a hole and into a bag. It comes with it's own permanent tray thingy so when it's time to change the litter I just scoop the wet litter through the hole into the bag and fill it back up with crystal litter. So far, I can say this is the lowest maintenance setup I've ever had, using crystal litter at all is more $$, but worth it for us as we live in an apartment and this litter box does not stink at all. It's been 3 weeks, so far so good!"
5,Better than Grandma had....,The quality of this device is much better than most. This is especially true for the gears. I've seen manual beaters that have plastic gears and plated steel construction that rust for twice the money. I am very pleased and will use these for a lifetime. You just can't beat a manual beater for those delicate jobs that need a little finesse. Buy these with confidence.
1,THe dark side of Ludemann,"At first point, it seemed to be a good idea. But after a few pages it becomes quite clear that Ludemann's opus is a comlete failure. Bad anti-apologetics which is just as poor, ideological and biased, as the narrowest minded old apologetic. The worst bit is the part about NT. To make a long story short, here is an example of Ludemann's type of ""reasoning"": he just lines up a sample of antijewish polemic out of the NT (ignoring completely the context), puts it along with some nasty bits by Eusebius and Luther, and here we go. And this man (who, nervetheless, did some good job in the past) pretends to be a serious historian! Obviousely the poor man is undergoing deep psychological problems. One more ageing teenager desperatly trying to ""kill the father""... What a pity."
3,Not bad but not great either,"Without Noise is an alright album but I would say that is nothing great. It mixes between Spanish and English a lot so everything can get really confusing at times. I understand both the English and Spanish language but when you hop back and forth several times in a song, it can confuse you.The beats have a salsa flavor to it along with some pretty good bass. It's good enough to rattle the windows in my car. But again, the lyrics don't fit in too well.This CD is pretty much for people who understand the Spanish and English languages extremely well (as to not get so confused in the middle of the song). I don't know Spanish extremely well....more like, just well enough, so this CD lost me in that aspect. The beats were good though so it helped the CD a lot."
2,Squirrels love it,I should have a picture of the one sitting in it eating right now. The only way birds get food is when a squirrel knocks some to the ground.
5,Outstanding,"Excellent!!I love this backpack, it's so useful, helps me a lot. I'm a Network Engineer and this backpack was just like a gift from heaven. Almost unlimited storage space for my HP DV6-1030US (watch my review on it) and network tools/network cables, etc.So this was a great purchase, i totally recommend it."
2,Shame on Fox and WB,"I agree with everything everyone has said. FoX and WB can Kiss my you know what. Way to pull TSCC in favor of Dollhouse, we all saw how that worked out and now hey lets further fray the fan base with their shoving blue ray down our throats to get the movie we really wanted to see. I wish James Cameron had the means to buy his baby back and do this thing right. Screw Fox and WB. I still liked the movie but I'm tired of the Pg-13 ratings and blue ray being forced upon me. I already spent my money on a 300 Dvd collection! Im not building a blue ray collection. Is it better, yeah, but hollywood has made enough money off of me. Thanks for making me hate you more Fox and WB, hope you got what you wanted. I am just one person but I am sure you have just alienated over half of the fans you had left. Good movie poor distribution content."
3,Terminator Baleout,"I avoided watching/owning this for quite some time since it stars Bale, I just think he's the worst actor on the planet. True to form he adds nothing to the Terminator franchise. If you're a fan of the series of movies then it's worth getting, but this movies doesn't really do much aside from stagnate the concept even more. I can't even remember how it ended already."
2,Terminator DVD release sucks,"The movie was great and all, but what happened to the extras (Deleted Scenes, Bloopers, Gag Reel and other extras)? This was a bare bones release. If they are going to release a movie to DVD, they should have all the extras that the fans would like to have. What's the deal on the digital copy? Why should I have to log onto the Web to get my digital copy. I paid for a 2-Disc set, do I expect to have a DVD of the movie and a Digital Disc copy of the movie, not a coupon to download the digital copy. Let's see that's fraud in my opinion or disceptive practices. Wonder what the FCC would think about this?"
5,Awesome Movie,"If you like the Terminator Series, this movie is a must. It is a very good story line with excellent effects. There's only one part of the movie that I thought was a little ""cheesy,"" but that's my opinion. I know what the reasoning behind it was, but I think it was just unnecessary. I won't say what it is because I do not want to spoil it."
4,Is it a prequel? Or a sequel?,"This really is a good movie. Good action. Good acting. and above all it's a good-dang Terminator movie I am not looking for Academy Award stuff here. I just want a movie that has explosions and robots. Does the movie have to have a good script? No, the thing that makes the old movies so good is the ridiculous script. I want people to stop whining that this movie sucked because if you compare it to the old films, without letting your biased for the ""classics"" get in your way, then this movie is actually better then the first two. The third one was really just a mistake and I will acknowledge that at least.So if you want a good action movie with a decent story, and quite convoluted at times if you think about it,then watch this one.PS think about the title of this review also while you watch."
2,A Disappointmentator,"I have really liked the the first three movies, even the goofy third. This one was difficult to follow. The individual acting was good with very nice especial effects. However, the plot was really simple with few surprises and figuring out why some of the important characters were important was distracting. It turns out that aside from Conner and Reese, they weren't. Not really. Then, we have the end. I felt it was straining for some deep moral/ethical statement, but just struck me as empty, loose and amateurish. I think it's really time to Terminate this series :)"
4,Nice franchise,"I really enjoyed this movie, as a Terminator fan I was wating long for the aftermath of the judgement day event..The movie doesn't actually follows the same timeline as the original date, there's no laser guns and no T-800 walking around in packs.Nice performance from Chistian Bale and Sam Worthington, great fx and sound.The director's cut edition really leaves you kind of dissapointed as there's no valuable new material..."
3,disappointing,"The plot of this movie is weak. It is OK if you want mindless action though, just don't expect a satisfying story."
3,Factory fighting scene again,"I want to add two things:first, early into the movie, the sequences in which John Connor tries to escape a trap of the terminators by driving a helicopter and gets shot down, obviously imitate the sequences of Children of Men in which Julian gets shot in a car. Indeed, McG expressed his admiration to that movie in an interview for this movie. But the interaction between the helicopter and its environment is not strong enough. Therefore the so-called ""you-are-there"" feeling abates. In addition, because the way those sequences are shot is not the style of this movie's cinema photography, they seem to be abruptly tucked into the movie.Second, the fighting scene between human and terminator in a factory, as a climax, happens yet again. Perhaps it's a solution to the series' previous instalments but isn't it repeated too many times?"
2,Not the best Terminator movie but I will buy the BluRay,"For me this was the least liked Terminator movie,, I even liked 3 better.It was a bit corney and watching Cristian Bale is hard to do after hearing his screaming rant temper tantrum he had while making the movie, its just hard to like or support an actor that is such a jerk in real life.CheersDavyo"
5,Wow,"awesome film, better then T3 and problem was storylines but this was doing the writer strike, other then that awesome movie"
3,DVD Extras,"In regards to DVD Extra's, you have to buy the 2-Disc Edition at Target. It has the same extra's as the blu-ray edition. So if you don't have a blu-ray player, go to target and get the movie there."
3,Where they kidding?,"This movie was sub-par. It was just called Terminator to sell tickets. I didn't enjoy more than half of this movie. It was OK. But the other three where so much better. For those of you who scoffed at T3, I think after you saw this one you where probably more grateful for T3 than you had been. Let's hope, since they did take in a little bit of a profit, if you factor in the worldwide total, let's hope the next one is better. Let's hope they get better writers and a better director and a better soundtrack. I'd hate to see the Terminator franchise meet its own Judgement Day.I think my favorite part about this movie wasn't the movie itself but Christian Bale's on set tirade.I give this movie a 3/10. Sorry...It grows on you a little but, mostly it disappoints."
2,Cap won't close,"Great oil. However, you'll never get the cap back on the bottle. Once you open it, the cap won't go back on. I placed the cap on top of the bottle to cover it, so next time I went to pick up the bottle, I ended up dropping it, wasting the oil."
4,Really good!!!!!!!!,"Have been looking for truffle oil for some time and after reading the reviews here, I decided to give this brand a try. It is excellent, a little goes a long way and it's a great addition to soups and pizza. Expensive, but worth it. I will order the larger bottle the next time."
2,GW Wallet,"The wallet I received, while it was a Gundam Wing wallet, did not have the correct image on it. I only had the gundam on it, no Heero Yuy at all."
4,Carl Thomas Never Disappoints!,Carl Thomas' new project is EXACTLY the way I expected it to be. He stays true to his own style and gives the listeners what they want.
5,brown and black snaps,this is for la raza you got a revolutionary song by the under rated Mexicano MC Man. You got an old school bump from Brown N Proud. Then you got some more raza in Mr. Kee from the Bay. The Hood got some bump with a tight song from Triple Beam and another heata from Taydatay. If you can get this album its gotta alot of snaps.
1,Poor Guide to Alaska Rivers,"I bought this book expecting to get a comprehensive guide to Alaska's rivers and found that it was a large let down. I am a life long Alaskan and the book is missing several rivers that are well known to boaters and easily accessible from the road system which is very important when choosing rivers to raft in Alaska since there isn't a large road system. The river descriptions are poor along with the directions on how to get to the put in's and take out's, several of the rivers in this book are missing put in's and take out's that are well known to anyone that has run these rivers."
2,The one month waiting is not good,"I bought this item and it took one month to get to me. I really think a month is rather long. I know I live on an island, not on another planet. I also emailed the seller twice and never got a response. So much for good business practice."
3,God's Smurai,The book was very enlightening through the second world war and a few years after. It clearly told of the experiences of an officer in the Japanses Naval Air Force and his many expeiences throught the war years. It also was interesting to see what the war left him with to a point. The last third of the book was loose and somewhat hard to follow. I appreciated his experiences but they could have been summarized more clearly than just going on and on. I rate the first half of the book as four stars and the last half as two stars. Hence the overall rating of three stars.
3,"Light reading, surprisingly enjoyable -- with all the warts","I see the prior reviewers covered just about every point I had intended to mention:- holes in the plot- healthy humor, even if a little over the top at times with a bit of believable romance- beginnings of a great author in the making- characters needing a little more fleshing out- great setting in Chicago with ethnic diversity- light reading, fast paced (for the most part)- not excessively wordy about non-essentials (in other words, this is not an someone trying to make a word quota)I look forward to reading more by this author and see how he develops not only his protagonist, but also as an author."
5,A Twist on the Pied Piper,"This is a great book. When Gast(the piper)comes to Hamelin, he befriends Geist, a badly treated baker's servant. Gast thinks up a plan to rid Hamelin of disease-carrying rats. When the citizens refuse to pay Gast, he takes revenge on the city's children. This book is based on the Pied Piper story, but has enough of a twist to make it suspenseful and interesting. I very strongly recommend this book."
1,Worst vacuum on the market!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I bought this cute little vacuum, and after absolutely hating it for nearly one year, I have junked it. First of all, it is very loud. Second, wildly flimsy. Beyond that all the tools fall off while you use it! Even the main floor attachment. To make this more aggravating, the actual hoses (the metal ones) fall off each other! It also has a flip brush option for carpet/hardwood. When you flip it into position, it just flips right back when you begin your task!If I hadn't immediately thrown away all the packaging, I would have returned it.Please dont waste your money on this piece of crap. I am sooooo surprised that hoover actually has not pulled it! I would never buy any hoover again."
5,A woman to admire,"As a reader, I don't frequent the biography sections of bookstores. But I chose to buy and read this book, because Lou Salome's name was familiar to me from Irvin Yalom's book ""When Nietzsce Wept"". She was the infamous femme fatale who played a very signinficant role in lives of some of the most remarkable men, intellectuals of 19th-20th century Europe - Nietzsce and Rilke to name just two of them. Though she might have destroyed them emotionally, she also inspired and guided them intellectually and creatively. That's what makes this biography such a fascinating read - Lou Salome had a life filled with most exciting men and most extravagant choices. This book grabs you with its light writing style, eventful ""plot"", and interesting yet not overwhelming insights into the people and spirit of that era. This a book I enjoy to go back to, and re-read certain parts of it."
5,Excellent. Everything was perfect.,"The filters arrived just as they said they would, and they even arrived a little bit earlier than I was expecting!"
3,this is ok,"I recieved this in a timely manner...I had one issue, and won't go into it, but the seller more than compensated me. I give this a 3 star as the filters, even though they say they are suppose to be the size to fit my humidfier, they are shorter than the ones that came with it therefore they don't work properly in my humidifer."
1,This should be in the Fiction section.,"This book is rated right up there with Furmon's (sp?) book. It should be classified as Fiction, not non-Fiction. The medical examiner's proved Furman so wrong, and time will show just how dysfunctional Terry's family is. I am half way through Michael's book now - a much better read if you want to see what was really going on - regardless of what side of the issue you were on."
1,Broderbund Customer Service is a Bummer!,"In view of the terrible reviews that were posted for PrintMaster 17, we ordered a DVD for PrintMaster 16 to replace our old PrintMaster 15. When the DVD arrived, we uninstalled PM 15, disabled our antivirus program and firewall security programs and ran a Norton WinDoctor to clean up our registries. When we started the PM 16 installation, we got the following:""Error 1904/ModuleC:\Windows\system 32msxml4.dll failed to register. Contact your Support Personnel"". Contact with a Broderbund Customer Service Representative resulted in an e-mail address for Technical Service. We detailed our problem in trying to download PM 16 and stated that we provided enough data to warrant a human response and NOT AN AUTOMATED Frequently Asked Questions answer. We still got an automated FAQ answer back. Bottom Line! Broderbund does NOT provide any real product support! Think twice before you order any of their products."
2,Doesn't really work.,"I had high hopes for this based on other reviews. I was hoping to not have to spoon grease off from soups and stews any more. I tried this on a crock pot dish, braised lamb shank. It seemed to pull off more than just the grease, so I stopped using it, didn't want to lose all the sauce. The clean up is difficult. I ended up spending a long time with this under very hot water. It was hard to get all the spices out of the bristles. I don't think I will be using this again."
2,not very good,my husband wanted this to help keep his fat intake down and this was not working as it stated. the price was ok but needed it to work alot better.
1,What a mess!,"This product should be taken off Amazon's site. Cheap, inferior, waste of money. Horrible to set up, leaked, collapsed under it's own weight. I feel stupid for even having considered buying it. What a mess."
3,"big, fat, and green","Big fat book that covers a wide array of investing areas. However, sadly, it is very surfacy. Does not go deep in the how- to's and is not exhaustive in the areas that it has chosen to focus on. I have read many books covering the topics that the authors write about. The authors have left out much info that one must discover the hardway if one chooses to pursue the author's chosen investment routes. Would be nice for junior high kids looking to learn about what investing means."
1,Cheepo,"I ordered these with high hopes, but was very disappointed. I don't even know how well the electronics worked because the workmanship was too shabby to last, and the padding was so thin and uncomfortable looking, I put them right back in the box. I am sending them straight back to China. I can't imagine how unhappy I'd be had I paid $140!"
1,Most uncomfortable shoes EVER!,I loved the way these shoes looked in the picture and couldn't wait for them to arrive. As soon as they came I tore open the box and tried them on. I could not believe how painful they were to have on. I tried different socks but it made no difference. I had to return them. I was quite disappointed. They hurt so much and were so stiff that I could not even keep them on for five minutes.:-(
4,"It's good for its use. Nothing more,nothing less","Good thing is, the product is exaclty what it says it is online. I will hopefully be used again next year, but with kids, who knows. I think it served its purpose well. I have no complaints, except that it could make sounds in the future. Product was perfect overall."
3,"when, book 5 ? (Prophesies)","The Blending series is the first Sharon Green I've read. Really enjoyed it, though I'd say that book 3 (Challenges) was my favorite. I still like Kambil, even though he's grown more villainous. Does anyone know when Book 5 is supposed to be published? I certainly do hope all the loose ends are tied up (but I know it's already written). Does Avon plan to reprint any other Sharon Green books?"
5,Great Product,Perfect...this is just what I needed. The imbeciles that gave negative reviews didn't realize that the cigarette lighter in their car didn't work while the car was off. If your cigarette lighter doesn't operate with the car turned off then this product is worthless to you. If your cigarette lighter does operate with the car turned off then it is a great product.
4,Outdoor Fan Works Well if You are Sitting in Front of It!,"Wonderful concept but it could probably move more air if it was oscillating. Just the same, it is cooling if you are sitting in the direction of the fans."
5,Beautiful and lightweight,So far I have loved every item I have gotten from Silverspeck. I wasn't too sure about these when I ordered them because I usually don't wear dangling or heavy earrings. But these are so lightweight I hardly even notice them. Plus the etching on them is beautiful. Another win Silverspeck!!
3,Maximum sexual build-up for a sub,"""Morley"" creates a terrific build-up in sexual tension in this book and this build-up is actually the subject of the book. The last chapter is a disappointment but the chapters before are steam-generating haps and mishaps. The mental make-up of the heroine is not worked out as well as in ""O"" but the story is good."
1,Disappointing,"Took the product as directed, 3 pills a day for two months. Did not increase nor enhance my waning libido. Felt tiny spikes of desire here and there, but overall this product did nothing for me. Placed an order for Hot Plants For Her & will try for two months to see if this one will work."
5,My experience with Fematril,Great female libido aid. I am far past my sexual prime. Especially after losing my husband to cancer 12 years ago and 3 children to guide through thier young adulthood. I was accepting the fact that my own love life was obsolete.I have since met a wonderful man and felt I needed a bit of help in the intimacy department when I researched on the internet I found Fematril as being the one I felt confortable trying and I'm happy I did.If anyone over 50 finds themselves reading this do youself a favor and order a bottle...you'll thank me later!
2,not recieved yet,"Ordered product 1 month ago and have not recieved it yet,therefore i cannot review product"
2,Not worth the 10 bucks!,"Virtually every track of this recording is distorted due to what must have been excessive gain during the recording. Shame, otherwise a pretty good performance."
5,Entertains and educates -For hours!,My 5 year old loves this cd-rom. I have to make her stop playing after about 2 hours. She has learned a lot from this ans well as the other Magic Schoolbus games she has started collecting.
5,So sad it's no longer available!,"I love this tea kettle! I wanted to buy another one for our vacation house, but it is no longer available. I understand the problems that people had with it but I had found simple and effective work-arounds. Yes, the base gets a few spots. For me they came off with a quick wipe. I never did have any trouble reading the water gauge. And the lid. Yes it's quite difficult to take off so I only use it for cleaning the kettle. To fill with water I use the spout. It's fast and much better looking (to my eye) than its big brother. I'm hoping it has just been pulled for a redesign"
5,Synergy's Magnum Opus,"Synergy's best album, and one of the truly best electronic instrumental synth albums ever made. All of Larry Fast's (Synergy) works are worthy, and they were certainly original, but this CD has the makings of a true masterpiece. There are elements of so many styles of music here, but all done in an aesthetic, harmonic way. Unlike so many electronic artists and albums of today, Audion contains not only listenable, plesant music, but challenging compositions. If you buy only one Synergy CD, make it this one."
3,CLOSE BUT NO CIGAR,"One of the most memorable events of my lifetime as I was an awestruck 16 year old keeping one eye on the moving company as they were packing up my family's belongings to move in the following days..... ""I said you can pack whatever you want but don't even think about touching the TV..... ""...... Anyway, it is awesome this long awaited EVENT is finally out on DVD but I have to admit great disappointment over the omission of several acts completely (Rick Springfield, Power Station, The Hooters, ( & key songs/ performances by Madonna (""Love makes the world go round"", The Cars (""You might think"" & ""Drive"", and last but not least considering it was the #1 single on BILLBOARD that week DURAN DURAN's ""A View To A Kill' ....... If anyone knows the real reason Rick Springfield and/or The Power Station was not included, please feel free to post...... Let's just hope that one day, a more comprehensive version of July 13, 1985 will be released with or without Led Zepplein........."
1,My MTV copy is BETTER,"I have recorded entire live aide broad cast on MTV back in 1985, and is better than this official release for quality, and sound, as well as MISSING so many valuable performance. WHY????? is my question. Yeah, it is about Hungry for Africa, but to raise money, you want to provide what its worth. DO NOT BUY it if you want to go back in time for your personal memory....give DONATION direct to UNICEF instead. Also, PLEASE make sure where your money is going to first."
4,long overdue with a twist,I too was dissapointed that the DVD set does not include all material however as far Led Zep are concerned they did not want their performance to be included because they thought it was sub standard and not worthy.That being as it may it's taking 20 years to get material such as these DVD's on such a momentous world event that defined a generation is long overdue and I'll take anything! One for the library to the younger generation.
4,Live Aid 4 disc set,"I bought the one disc version of this. I was not happy with it because the songs were not in their entirety. I waited until the price came down and I was ready. I am so glad. What a wonderful experience this is. To see the artists in 1985 is an adventure. Even the oganizer Bob G performing is wonderful. Do buy this and forget about your problems for a while and be part of this. A good cause and a beautiful day. It is easy to find the artist you want to listen to. The menu is so helpful. This brings a lot of joy to share with friends, don't watch it alone have people over. You will be singing and taking it in.Debra Envall"
1,wassup,"manson used to be cool but now all he does is exploit his ""fans"". he complained about exploitation and now he does it himself. what a hypocrite. these slapstick interview cds r not art, but instead another income scource for the already rich rock star. exploitation at it's best (or for us worst)!"
4,A Cool Friend!,"My 5-year old daughter is not a ""dolly girl,"" but loves animal toys. So she LOVES ""Duchie"" the Chihuahua and all her accessories. Good for imaginative play and just to love, plus she's ""cute and cool,"" according to my little girl! Though the purse is a little J-Lo-ish, she loves carrying her around and changing her ""outfit"" and jewelery A great gift for any little doggie lovers."
2,Beware the weather - and the F-bomb,"The story's fun, no denying it. In terms of plot, my only problem was that the author tried to be too coy with why the heroine was on the run from her Weather Warden peers.I just wish Ms. Caine hadn't been so coarse in her choice of language. When the ""F"" words start to outnumber the plot twists, I decide the author lacks creativity.It's a shame, as I was looking for a series to enjoy. This one's got a good concept, but I won't fund it."
2,Mistakes do happen,"Ill Wind is the 1st book of the Warden series. The Warden's are a special group of people who have control of the elements; wind, water, fire & earth. I felt the series overall to be lacking. The author had the potential to make the series great, however it falls short with the one-dimensional characters. Its like reading the same book over & over with different scenarios. The main character is just bumbling along. I ordered the complete series, & stopped reading it after the third book."
3,Good concept..Needs polishing,"The concept behind Ill Wind is a refreshingly new one in the ""urban fantasy"" genre. The characters are good and the magic system is pretty interesting. Unfortunately, it felt like Rachel Caine wrote this in a hurry to lay down a backstory for the second book in the series. Ill Wind just seemed to lack polish and had that ""rush to the ending"" feel to it."
5,Truly awesome,"This book was fantastic. What a wonderful place to go for several hours. I was glad to see on the author's website that two more books will be coming out this year - Summer and Winter. Don't pass up this book - you will be cheating yourself of a wonderful, original adventure."
3,ok,"this is one of the movies of Fellini that although written well, it lacks 'life'....this is the best way i can describe it"
1,Rip off!,"This book is a word for word rip off of Lois Duncan's ""Stranger with My Face."" The publisher of this book should be ashamed, as well as the author."
3,Obsession: No Ending,"3-Stars is out of generosity for WS.I've read numerous books over the years, but never, ever read one that didn't have an ending. Of course, some authors intend keeping their readers in suspense, 'especially when a sequel or trilogy will follow,' but not to the point their novel doesn't answer 'any' questions. Literally, NONE!Obsession is the only book I've read that ended without an ending.After reading the reviews, apparently, a good number who read this book back when, couldn't locate the sequel, Possession. Since it's out of print, I bought a used copy, which I feel unfair and tricked, as a reader and consumer. But, I don't particularly care for senseless endings, and curious if and how Ms. Staub whips up a real conclusion."
5,Excellent first novel! Gripping Story!,I was unable to stop reading once I picked up this very well-written first novel. Susan McBride has created a multi-faceted book that hooks the reader from page one and doesn't let go until you've read the last page. I look forward to more books from this new author.
5,A classic book that establishes the bases for sustainable development policy,"As a classic in the field, the book establishes the bases for sustainable development policies, and can help to cope with the challenges of future energy supply, limits to growth, and climate change.I deserves deep consideration by those responsible for policies and actions that can influence the next decades scenario."
4,Impressive personal knowledge of the subject.,"Looking through the lens of social philosophy rather than musicology, Bill Martin succeeds in his very personal account of the importance of Yes. Entirely absorbing and insightful, this is a compelling volume of social criticism which explained much of my own past to me. Eventually, however, I found the personal interpretations too much to bother with and was made hungry for a fuller technical study of this fascinating music. For example, writing out strings of note-letters is an inadequate substitute for quoting the musical lines, and avoiding musical techno-speak develops a techno-speak all its own. A fine and absorbing read that goes 50% of the way towards being comprehensive."
5,"Excellent, practical handbook","This is a great, practical guide to EMI testing and troubleshooting. Includes basic fixes, utility of those fixes to resolve observed issue(s), and estimates regarding the improvement those fixes might provide. It also includes a section on in-house, ""confidence"" testing (without shelling out for test chamber and all of the expensive test equipment... though you'll still need some)My background - BSEE, 15 yrs commercial and military experience. I think the text would be especially useful for Test, EMI and project engineers. It avoids deep derivation of formulae and would be useful to technicians and designers as well."
1,BEWARE!! MADE IN CHINA,"I am so tired of finding my favorite tools now being made in China! These pliers are sub-standard quality, poorly made, and just as expensive as the original USA made good ones! Look elsewhere...maybe you can find one MADE IN THE USA somewhere!"
5,"Wisdom from over 6,000 years ago","I just finished reading The I Ching: The Book of Answers and was most impressed with the author's insightful interpretations of the I Ching's sixty-four hexagrams. The origins of this timeless classic of universal wisdom are thought to date back more than 6,000 years to the great sage Fu Hsi. The I Ching lies at the root of both Confucian and Taoist philosophies. Wu Wei provides perfectly clear, unambiguous direction while remaining completely true to the ancient writings. This newly revised and expanded edition of Wu Wei's classic is unparalleled in its clarity, making this the easiest-to-grasp I Ching on the market. The cover design and packaging with french flaps make this easily the most attractive I Ching available and I'll be giving this to friends as gifts.This is a totally different book from the author's earlier edition and is a delight to read."
1,This Kindle book very limited-get Wilhelm Baynes version instead,"Run away from this e-book. The author provides a readable history of the I Ching, describing its origins, its use through the ages and its place in the contemporary world. HOWEVER, without a table of contents, the text must be read straight through, like a beach novel. A Kindle reference work without a table of contents! What was the publisher thinking?? And then have the nerve to charge over $10?? Run away from this! If you want an excellent Kindle I Ching with an active table of contents, please get yourself the Wilhem/Baynes version, with the introduction by Jung; the Princeton University Press knows how to do a Kindle I Ching! And its under $10."
2,Spirits in the Wires,"A bit sophmoric, actually. I was disappointed as i have enjoyed a lot of de Lint's books. But this was too obvious, too pedandic and i wound up not finishing it."
2,Disappointing,"Spirits in the Wires held a lot of promise for me, but it just didn't deliver. De Lint's regular stable of Newford characters is here, and I found that distracting rather than pleasant, since I felt he was a little too self-referential. Even the presence of Christy and Geordie Riddell, among my favorite de Lint characters ever, couldn't quite save this one. The writing plodded along in places, and the magic in the books didn't take place in Newford, but rather on the Internet. Since De Lint is a master of urban fantasy, that disappointed me. I also didn't feel it would have made a good introduction to Newford, since a lot of the time I found myself reading passages and going, ""Huh? Who are they and why do they matter?"" For a better introduction to Newford and its denizens, try one of de Lint's short story collections, or maybe Someplace to be Flying."
1,The worst Adult movie ever seen,I have no Idea why I watched the whole movie it was all about herI felt sorry for the guyWild Wendy
2,MADE IN CHINA!,"These work O.K. and seem to be well made, but they were not made in America like it says in the product features."
2,Not what i thought,I bought this CD on the recommendation of the other reviewer because i also saw the 3 Irish Tenors on PBS.These are not the same people.I am very disapointed in the CD.
4,GROOOOOVY!,"Although no new ground was broken here, I still liked it. The music is quite infectious and fun. The lyrics range from serious to campy. My favs are: ""Hey Now Now""- What isn't to like about this one? Rockin' video too! ""There""- Nice ballad, good melody. ""Rewind""- Really cool, great bridge and transition after second verse. ""Forget You Too""- Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved? You decide. Mellow with acoustic guitar. Overall, this is a CD worth owning. Looking forward to some new stuff. Peace"
4,Cute Little Book with Great Pictures,"I was having a hard time finding books with bouquets. Out of all the books I looked at, this book had the best pictures and ideas. I like the fact that they tell you the names of each flower. It also tells you which flowers are in bloom for each season. I found it very helpful. A lot of info. in a very cute little book."
5,,"Red Dwarf is the best show ever. The first three episodes that are on this tape are probably the best, I'd have to say. I think that the first series is the absolute best thing ever on TV, and the other 6 (soon 7) are right behind it. I definitly suggest buying these videos."
3,A Good Read But Not Scholarly History,"The book is a homey narrative written many years after the fact. As a consequence, it has some factual errors. Divisions were (and are) commanded by Major Generals, not Lieutenant Generals. The commander's name is misspelled. The caption on the photo of Capt. Boniface's body speaks to another incident at a later time. Nonetheless, the author's folksy style makes it an easy read."
4,Actron CP9125,"This one is very basic OBDII code reader, it works on both Toyota Camry 95 and Honda minivan 2001 and save me time to go to Auto Zone. Can not reset check engine from this but not a big deal."
5,"Great deal, works perfectly.","Don't bother with the more expensive units that display the explanations of the codes. This is all you need. There are plenty of sites in the net that can tell you what the codes mean for each vehicle. Works great for getting and clearing codes. If your check engine light is on, this is the tool for you. Highly recommended."
5,"As always, Kate Walker shines","Cesare and Megan marry for what seems like the most practical reason of all...she's pregnant. Thing is, it's another man's baby. Cesare steps into the role of husband and father, only to discover there won't be a baby after all. Can they make the marriage work? Two people who leave too many words unsaid--words that need to be said--do they have a chance at love?Kate Walker shines in The Sicilian's Wife!"
5,Leaving home-David P. Celani,The best book for adults with childhood trama. The approach offers (the survior of abuse) a greater understanding of the aspects of their behavior. As it relates to the past abuse. A must read for both the survior and their family.
2,This is not an accurate book. I do not like it,"The author poses an entirely false dichotomy between ""heart"" wisdom and ""brain"" knowledge. I have news for him -- if he did not have a positive brain he could not have written this or other books and could not communicate period. The brain is NOT, repeat NOT a negative hostile entity, as he posits. Having integrated body wisdom is important. People cannot function adequately and positively -- they cannot think, act or anything else -- unless they utilize both brain and heart. I am sorry that Paul Pearsall's docs missed the clues of his lymphoma for so long -- but that does not make their brains -- nor his -- nor the brains of others - hostile and negative entities. I was going to sell my copy to a used book store but I think I will just put it in my recycle bin to reduce the risk that someone who knows little would be misled by it. Oh, and Chinese medicine does not refer to ""chakras"" - never! That is a Hindu concept. How ignorant can he be?"
1,slippery quasi-science,"This book was well-meaning. It alleges that heart recipients take on many of the neuropsychological chacteristics of the heart donor. It never tells us how much contact/communication the heart transplant recipient has with the family of the donor [Suggestibility is a powerful influence in situations like these]. There was no attempt at ""blind"" evaluation of the recipients. The data is not fleshed out - much too flimsy, ethereal.But then, in all fairness, if we go back 150 years or so when we knew little about microwave transmission and some one were to have suggested the possibility of long-distance transmission of sound and images, he/she would have been thought to be a bit ""looney""."
1,A confusion of paradigms that comes out looking silly,"Yes, there are sometimes personality changes in heart transplant patients. The surgury can result in hypoxia or small strokes that damage the brain causing personality change. Multiple sources of information overwhelmingly demonstrate that the brain is the seat of emotion as well as reason. Claiming that memory and emotion reside in the heart obscures the useful message - the message that we would do well to slow down and pay better attention to our bodily feelings and our emotions."
4,More relevant than when it was first written,"Nine years after this book was first written, the fictional confrontation between the China and India is more believable than ever. Just recently, the Indian government will be allowing the Dalai Lama to visit Tawang in spite of the objections coming from Beijing. India has been making a series of critical errors in just about everything it has done, while the growing gap between China and India in almost all areas has emboldened Beijing to humiliate New Delhi every chance it can. The fictional war described in the book turned out very badly for the Indians. The recent revelation of the lack of a credible Indian nuclear deterent given its falsified thermonuclear test and failed missiles only increases the risk of such a conflict."
2,Not good for small hands,My wife could not squeeze the press together since she has small hands. The handle also broke around 1 yr of use. It is not able to crush many cloves of garlic at one time. We have since bought a garlic press made of stainless steel at Walmart under the George brand that works much better and only cost $10.
2,Must have hands of steel to prees garlic through!,What a waste of money! It would be easier to smash it with a knife than use this thing. I have a no-name press that works much better than this one!
5,A refreshing perspective on the doctrine of God,"In 2000, I went off to seminary in Kentucky. Before I left, my parents bought me this book as a gift. As I leafed through the pages and read this doctrine of openess, I couldn't help but be drawn this argument theologically, philosophically, and even Biblically. We serve a relational and loving father - attributes that are key themes in scripture. The openess proposition is a welcome addition to evangelical thought. Thank you Sander's, Basinger, Pinnock & Boyd."
3,Not sure if it is the disc's fault,"I bought this to clean my Daewoo vcr/dvd combo player -- of course, the dvd player, itself. The dvd player would skip while playing my dvd's that I had burned. I'm not sure if it skips professionally recorded dvd's because I don't play them. The disc cleaner functioned exactly as described it would and was easy to use. Unfortunately, my dvd player still skips. But I don't know if it is due to the Daewoo brand or the disc cleaner. So in fairness, I cannot completely say it did or did not do its job as I know as well as anyone that when you own something like a lower brand electronic for 4 years, you sometimes have to be greatful that it has lasted as long as it did. Plus, before buying the disc, I had disassembled the dvd player and tried to manually clean it, myself and that also did not fix the problem so the dvd player may be beyond repair."
5,great!,Awesome book--I love it & there will definitely be another one to follow with the cliffhanger ending :) The Georgia Nicolson series never fails to amuse me--I love them all!
4,More of the good stuff,"another amusing Georgia Nicholson story -- nothing too new, but hilariously funny as always"
1,springy,"Nothing against the product, I'm just an idiot. Apparently there are different lengths of cheese slicer wires and this one was too long for my marble one. I fudged it to work but the slicing is weak. I had to buy another cheese slicer."
3,Cheese Wires,I don't know why they don't make super heavy duty ones.. they often break. i don't even use my cheese slicer anymore... too much of a hassle to take care of and clean. Knife and board it is from now on.
5,Just Happy,loved the quickness of arrival and the ease in ordering. Will keep the order slip when I need more of the same.
4,Cheezy wires,"Works great! Fast delivery! Since I have 4 now, I wont be ordering more for a while, but if needed, I will buy them here again in a heartbeat!"
3,Fischer-Dieskau has no soul,"I don't mind having a man sing Orpheo, even a baritone, but Fischer-Dieskau does not seem to feel his emotions at all. Maybe I'm holding him to a high standard because I'm used to Janet Baker, who just acts the hell out of the piece, but DFD sounds to me as if he's reading an encylopedia article, not playing a role.The nice surprises are Gundula Janowitz, warm and vulnerable as Euridice, and Edda Moser formidable as a goddess should be.The duet is very beautiful but it seems to be abbreviated, the whole second section replaced by an extended solo by Euridice. It's very wrong not to include the whole duet, which was so great an influence on Mozart and Beethoven, but Janowitz's solo is a joy.Really, if Fischer-Dieskau were more in his role, this would be a fine recording."
2,Broad coverage of material but just not that good,"I'm using this book for a class. We're up to chapter 6 now, and while I'm learning a lot of basic concepts, I've stumbled several times on the writing. It's terribly unclear in places, and clarity is essential in some of these places -- to be short, it's poorly written.The scope of the book is so wide that it necessarily is shallow. The illustrations are a bit silly and are not a great improvement to clarifying the concept. I am reminded of manuals that go into overwhelming detail as to what mouse-clicks or menu items to select, but don't explain why you want to do this to begin with.I haven't taken any certification exams as yet, but I would only recommend this book as a brief introduction to subjects that are covered more thoroughly and competently in other books."
3,Missing,"The Phantoms of Death triple Feature ReviewThe Phantom Killer falls short. . Unfortunately 8 minutes of this Feature is missing the begining .Note: Mantan Moreland was key in those 8 minutes before the feature story picks up.These 8 minutes is very essential to to the rest of the Phantom Mystery.I was very disappointed.After watching, you can determine as to what is taking place.The two other Features were good.The Phantoms of Death triple Features Would have recieved a 4 stars had theThe Phantom Killer been complete."
4,Emotionally moving experience.,"The soundtrack for ""The Cell"" is as emotionally jolting as the film itself, capturing all of the pain and intensity that the movie conveys to its audience. Howard Shore uses mostly strings and hints of new age chords to evoke the proper emotions for each unique scene. While certain moments in the music are meant to make the audience jump during the film, this soundtrack is mostly an emotional one, especially in the ending sequences of the film. Shore's gift with music especially shines here, and this is a soundtrack that is sure to please."
1,"Awful music, a real disappointment from the great Shore","Howard Shore has written some of the scores that matter the most to me--for Cronenberg, for THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. But his score for THE CELL is bombastic and bludgeoning, a lot of sound and fury passing as music. Dreadful. I hope he finds his way soon. The closest thing to a Bernard Herrmann of our time should do better than this.david g"
3,Shore's Middle Eastern Turn,"Howard Shore heavily utilizes Middle Eastern instruments and sound, borrowing some passages from a Moroccan band. Often loud, busy and unpleasant, ""The Cell"" is sometimes interesting, with a massive and awesome sound, but then it just becomes noise. Kudos to Shore though, for originating a different feel to his music, even if it still overworks his usual moods."
3,Decent workout,"* I workout a lot, as much as I can, and try to make sure my training is specific to the martial arts and fighting as much as possible. That's why I got this, and it did not really disappoint.* Now, I'm not really a fan of long warm-ups, which this program does have. However, once it gets started, you can definitely work up a sweat. It's mainly body-weight training and MA punches/ kicks (often with horrible form), but it does an excellent job of getting you mentally and physically ready for most altercations. The tempo is often too slow for me, but it will get others in better shape, to be sure.* Add in a good football-styled workout for your impact training, plus picking up the tempo, and you'll definitely be getting in the right kind of shape for beating off attackers.--- If you can't find a solo football impact-and-aerobics training workout you can do at home here on Amazon, contact me and I'll send you one for free."
2,"Pushups and Burpees and Punches, Oh My","The title just about says it all. Not that pushups, burpees and punches aren't great exercises, but do you really need to buy a DVD to tell you ""Do 30 seconds of X. Now do 30 seconds of Y.""There doesn't seem to be much thought given to the sequencing or timing of the intervals, and there is little to no actual technique instruction. Plus, the three workouts follow a goofy upper body, lower body, whole body split, which is presumably borrowed from body building, but makes no sense in martial arts training where movements are not designed to isolate muscle groups.Hackleman's second home work out DVD ""Crosspit"" fixes many of these shortcomings and is a much better product."
3,Beginner beware....,"I have training in kickboxing and kung fu, and I was looking for a home DVD that I could zone out to and get a great workout in.This is definitely a great workout, but it is NOT for beginners. I say that, not as a means to imply the workout is above anyone, but more so there is NO instructor guidance or form suggestions. It would be very easy for a beginner to do the moves wrong and injure oneself.The intelligence of the instructor is lacking, poor guy, but he gives you a great workout. Just don't expect him to be able to count above 10.It's a tad too repetitive. I've switched it up and did my own thing for a few rounds just because I was so bored with doing 10,000 burpees over and over again.As far as looking for a DVD to give me a guide while I do my home workouts, it's just fine."
5,3 heavy workouts,I was sweating pools when i first started these. these will get you into shape no joke. I recommend these to anyone looking for a workout
2,Ugh...,"I bought and have this doll. I don't recommend that you buy THIS Dana. When I first saw her at Target she looked cool, but when I took her out of the box some of her hair was shorter than the others, so when you took the ponytail out her hair looked horrible. Her make-up made her look like a psycho. If you want to buy a Dana, I would advise you to buy Campfire or Girls Nite Out. Her suspenders looked like an old man's, so I cut the suspenders off which made it look okay, but then her skirt wouldn't stay up. The streaks in her hair look unnatural. I ended up not using this doll at all."
2,OMG,"These are cute and have pretty cute clothes, but they are HOOCHIE MAMAS IN TRAINING.I HAD to get that off me chest.My mum agrees with me, and even said so on the radio lol!They have skimpy clothes that barely cover their ""areas"" and have these huge lips!They're teaching kids it's OK to wear micromini skirts and belly shirts, and the ""Punk"" ones introduce kids to stereotypes, which are bad."
5,Lewis Grizzard,"I just love Lewis Grizzard, his humor is outstanding. Excellent service.Sincerely,Pat Scott"
2,This may not be the book for you.,"At first glance the book looked pretty well written but you can't judge until you work through the tutorials. After going through the first few of them I decided to switch to another book due to the following problems.The projects do not load correctly from the CD since some of the media files are in the wrong place and there are mistakes in the tutorials as well. The most recent mistake was when a clip was moved out of the way on one page since it was not to be used until later, and then referred to on the next page as though it was not moved. Not only that, the space on the timeline where it was suposed to be was occupied by another clip.It is discouraging to follow a tutorial for quite a while only to get lost. I tried it several times to make sure it wasn't I who was the problem.The book does contain some fine examples including the Confidence Builder at the beginning but more time should have been taken to test all of the tutorials."
4,Sterling Silver Multi-Gemstone Ring,"Very pretty. The stones have a lot of clarity, and the garnet is an especially pretty red color. A good deal for the price."
2,a disappointed 9 year old's Dad,"We got this today and my son was very anxious to play with it.He used it with ""Need for Speed - Underground"". It was a very mixed bag - the car's view in the game changes and becomes hard to see very frequently. At times, it seems to take control of itself and there were times when it didn't work, period. I would caution anyone considering buying this...We are returning this one....."
1,waist of money,"i brought this for my son, it worked for about the first 10 days then the sensor i guess broke the throttle pedal would not accelerate neither brake using the brake pedal. it's a good wheel overall when it worked he said he could feel the response of the car perfectly with the wheel and it accelerated asoon as u taped the gas, 30 days has passed and the pedals no longer accelerate i really wish i new this would happen before i spent my money on it."
4,Couldn't Believe the Price,"I have used these hinges in the past. They work pretty well, but do wear out after a while (thats why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5). When I saw the price from this seller (Geroy's), I knew I had to stock up on them for all of my cabinets."
5,Excellent,"I purchased this from a local hardware store for a couple bucks more, which I find expensive for a drill bit. Connected to my 18-V drill it's going through 4-by-4 like butter. I like it over the Speedbor Max because the hole shaft is cleaner. And I love it over the spade bits because with those the exit hole is a huge mess. The 9/16-inch size is perfect for driving rebar through wood for a shed pad I'm doing. I have tried 1/2-inch (too small) and 5/8-inch (too large). This 9/16-inch size is harder to find but a better match for regular 1/2-inch rebar."
5,Double identity,"Amazing totally not what you would expect!!!!I recommend to any one!!!! Totally one of my favorite books of all,time"
4,Great read!,"Bethany Cole is just a normal girl living in Greenleaf, Pennsylvania> and then weird, unexplainable things start happening. Her mother> can't stop crying and her dad gets them all into the car to drive> off to a relative Bethany has never heard of in her whole life.> Bethany's surroundings get even hazier as her dad mentions an> unknown girl ""she must know about"" -- Elizabeth. In this> breathtaking novel, Haddix's foreshadowing and climactic twists are> perfect. With every chapter, she'll have you hungry for more. So if> you love twists and surprises, then ""Double Identity"" is the right> book for you! -- Alex Satola"
1,Didn't work with gamecube and satellite,"This device had everything I figured I'd want, except when I used my DirecTV R-15 and GameCube with the device, it caused my TV to lose color at random intervals. Neither device had a problem when hooked up directly.Returned item."
1,"Even at $159, it's not worth it.","This unit should be a simple (but effective) AV switcher box.If it worked as advertised, it would be a welcome 5-star solution for many a household.However, ours has never functioned properly from day one.The picture still cuts out randomly, while the audio continues.This is a problem that is well documented with these units. We chose to buy one anyway, because we couldn't find a similar unit in this price range. We were warned and we proceeded anyway.Now we're seriously shopping for a REAL replacement. We'll pay more, if necessary. In the end, the inexpensive $159 price tag is irrelevant. It's inexpensive price will quickly become insignificant, when the picture keeps cutting out during movies, concerts etc.I never write reviews. However, this unit has been so reliably unreliable, that I felt compelled. You've been warned."
5,The Ultimate Supercar Publication,"Evo magazines are more than just reading material. They are filled with extremely high quality full page, and quite often two-page spread pictures that are as stunning as they are artful. Also this magazine is very hard to find in stores, and if you do find one, its been read a thousand times, so I highly reccomend a subscription. Bottom line this is the ultimate supercar publication. Well worth the high cost, trust me."
4,Cross Country travel,"We travelled from NY to OK with two cats and a dog. We had limited space so the size of the carriers was a factor; the Kennel Cab I Medium was just right. The cats were unable to unlatch the front of the cages, one cat is 17 pounds the other is 8 pounds, and each were able to turn around and sit comfortably in the carrier. Any cat owner will tell you, getting them into the carrier was the most difficult task, as there is one entry. The seat belt feature made it easy to remove the carriers from the car to a hotel room."
3,Good For An iPod System - But Mediocre Sound,"Mediocre sound - highs are not particularly crisp, lows are limited and a little muddy.That being said, it's the best of the iPod speaker systems that I've heard - I suspect that the small enclosures in this type of device just don't have enough volume to get good bass. The sound is easily bested by any name-brand satellite (2 speakers + (sub)woofer) system that I've heard, even those costing $30 or so.The system is very portable, good looking, and it's wonderful that the unit plugs straight into a wall outlet without needing a power supply brick."
1,Quality control anyone?,"I bought these speakers twice, due to excellent reviews for its sound.The first one had a remote that wouldn't control fwd songs on ipod. The 2nd one was dead out of the box. Excellent service from both Vann's and Newegg who emailed RMA and shipping voucher that paid for shipping back the defective item."
1,You get what you pay for,"My first unit didn't even wok, so i had to replace it. Second one worked. Not an expensive unit, but sound quality is medium at best. Remote is not very helpful, bulky in size."
5,Amazing,I Just recieved this product today and so far im impressed. The sound quality is great it gets really loud plus it has a good bass.At that price is a steal. It took UPS 5 days to deliver so it was pretty fast. I will definetly recomend this product and buy from this company again!
4,notsobad-for the dough,"I checked these sound docks out for quite a while - a lot of comparisons .... i was leaning towards the Bose because that is what I have in my living room. This dock is for the kitchen ... Anyway - I couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger on that price ... So this, according to all my research, was comprable / or better. I'm very happy with it - I don't think anyone would be dissatisfied with this product .. unless they are stupid and think they are going to get similar sound to a $2,000 system -"
5,Awesome Sound,"For a small unit, the sound that comes from this packs quite a punch. It looks nice, works well with the Ipod touch. It also charges the ipod while it is docked and/or in use. I couldn't be more pleased. The only negative thing that I noticed is that when you remove your ipod with the unit still powered on you can hear buzzing from the speakers. This is corrected as long as you power off the unit. But I've tried many systems that have docking stations and this one competes with units many times the price. You won't be sorry you bought this unit."
4,Great gift for Mom,I read a professional review online that raved about this unit so I gave it a shot as a gift. Its an alternative to larger and/or more expensive units that take up more desk space...otherwise I'd just get a regular home systems. My mother enjoys the unit in her bedroom and said it sounds fine but isn't punchy bass like the Bose or the units with a subwoofer. It is way better than a clock-radio type speaker and beats the little junky units (anything under the similar price point of $100) you'll find at the big stores.
3,"Soft, not durable","These are very soft, warm, and comfortable long underwear pants, but after only 2 or 3 washings they have come apart at one seam. For the price, I'd expect them to last much, much longer. I won't buy this brand again, simply because of the durability issue."
4,Creme de La Creme,These pants are so comfortable and are exactly what is needed for cold winter days!
2,Chieftain,In contrast to other New Vanguard books does this one not provide new information. A far better publication is the old CHIEFTAIN book by Geroge Forty published by Ian Allen in 1979.
1,Received Broken - Bad Customer Support,I never got it to work. I contacted the company and they said that I must have plugged something in that drew too much power. But I hadn't - I especially tested on a low power item first.In all I was very disappointed - I have since bought a transformer from another company and have had no problems.
5,Wish there were more,This product arrived quickley. I love the purple pyrex I wish it would make a come back.
3,"Not just another skillet, almost",Very hard to find the right temp for some things. Easy to overcook some items. Easy to clean except bottom seems to get cruddy quickly. Inside shows scratches and has not yet been used with metal utensils. Unsure if more purchases of this series will be made. Only used 4 times to date.
1,Worthless pan and warranty,"We have one of these pans that is about two years old. The non-stick coating is coming off when you try to clean the burned-on food that sticks to the ""non-stick"" coating with normal use. The pan is now worthless and when I called Cuisinart regarding the warranty I was told that I would have to pay to ship the pan to them to ""be evaluated"" before they would honor the warranty. Even if they did honor the warranty I would have to pay $7 service charge in addition to the shipping cost to receive a replacement.This ""Lifetime Warranty"" is a joke and the pan is now not even safe to use.I will never purchase another Cuisinart product based on my experience with this pan and the customer service of the company."
2,Nonstick finish not in it for the long haul,"Have owned this pan for about five years, and really liked it at first. I'd hoped it would last a very long time, given the new-formula, supposedly sturdy, nonstick finish, as well as its strong stainless steel clad construction. But the nonstick surface has been progressively peeling off around the rivets for the past couple of years, not anywhere we use utensils. It's just plain surface failure, and we don't want it in our food. The degradation of the nonstick surface is all the more disappointing because this pan seems otherwise to have everything else going for it."
2,Poorly balanced and not flat,I was very excited to get this... so maybe I'm more disappointed than I should be for the price. This is a heavy pan with a nice thick non stick coating... but I don't actually use the pan because the balance is off. It tips far more than my super cheap lighter weight pan. Maybe it would be better on a grill on a gas stove but if you've got an already tippy electric stove this is *not* the right pan.
2,Think and Don't Think,"This game is a mix of well thought out missions and some that defy military tactics/strategy; even common sense(...1st Air Cav and Air Mobile)... when you can hole-up in a bunker(s) and fight off swarms of enemy = it would only take a few lobbed gernades to wipe everyone out OR on sneaky enemy to wrist-flick one in sideways ... when you're in a Huey and you're not able to control/aim any of the door gunners; well, that's pretty weak ... when there's multiple gunshots within a room containing prisoners coupled with sounds of struggle, yet the guards don't investigate; well, that's pretty weak (...Russian Roulette)... however, the game does deliver various types of missions over different terrain/environments ... it's just that one doesn't know when to ""think rationally""(...tactics / strategy) or ""think irrationally"", and do what one shouldn't do = the game is hit and/or miss"
1,Does not work,"I bought this game for the pc and the game does not even work, I guess it uses a program that is like obsolete or something like that"
1,Vironica Diangalo's clone,"My favorite book series is The Saddle Club and this thing looks like Vironica Diangalo's clone;NOT GOOD. All bratz look like her clone. They look MEAN.Buy a Myscene today!!!(Myscene ROCKS and so-called Bratz don't...Like I said,buy a Myscene today!!!"
4,Good guidelines/,"We used this book in combination with Magic 1, 2, 3 and didn't really find any conflicting principles. It worked great."
2,Could be helpful in certain situations.,"We bought this book because the reviews called it ""essential"" but we found it to be useless when we tried to put its ideas into practice. The authors do detail problems and offer solutions but their advice is actually quite vague. We bought the book to try to get some help but following the advice in the book just made us frustrated. They don't have suggestions for people like us, whose discipline issues aren't as pat as those in the book. For parents who are starting out, this might be a helpful book to read but for us, whose problems are more established, the book really wasn't any help at all."
2,Didn't Help Me,"I bought this hoping to find out how to better discipline my children. It was a big disappointment. I believe that children (even young toddlers) need to be told ""No"" and have set limits. Redirecting does not work for all children and certainly didn't with mine. They are too strong-willed and wouldn't forget what I was trying to direct their attention away from. We need to teach our children that we, as their parents, are in charge, and I don't think that this book advocates that."
3,Good insight on young toddlers!,"Reading this helped me understand what my 1-2 year old can process and how to approach discipline with her. The way Sears put this in perspective really opened my eyes. I reference this book often when encountering new problems....not that I always find an answer to my question.I do not like the constant attachment parenting preaching and the way Sears suggests you wont have any issues if you practice a.p....at this point the book falls very short, mostly for those of us with strong willed children. But this and the baby book are something I would buy again, I really like the facts they give you."
5,"Love your child, love this book!","Almost all of the parents I know say they want their child to grow up to be likeable, successful in a complex world, and capable of close loving relationships.Dr. Sears, a Pediatrician of 30 years, shares the way he and his wife Martha Sears R.N. (also a pediatrics expert), have raised their eight children with these same qualities in mind. With a loving approach tailored to each child's individuality, this couple gets results, while respecting the rights of all concerned. Wise, witty, and wonderful."
3,"Not what an 'attached parent"" needed...","I loved the ""Baby bBook"", but was quite dissapointed with this one. It has little advise to balance excessive attention and control our sun was getting as a result of this approach. At this point I beleive that most ""attachement"" parenting families with one child spoil their children rotten and deprive them of independance they crave by age 2. Unless they have 8 of them like Sears. For balance I would highly recommend all books by Magda Gerber, particularly ""Your Self-Confident Baby"". She is a recognised authority on early childhood by both Montessori and Waldorf movements. They changed my life. By the way, i did not need a huge chapter on benefits of not spanking my children. i doubt many Sears followers do."
4,Great for all Bebop and Manga Fans,"In case you haven't noticed, one of the greatest animes ever, Cowboy Bebop had come out in manga form with all new stories. The second volume is very good and funny, while keeping the Cowboy Bebop spirit. This features, of course, Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed and Ein. It is read in true manga form, right to left which can be a problem if your not used to it. There are 5 stories in this edition, all are good in their own right. But the last one is most Bebop-like (featuring Spike, broke, and following a raven haired girl with an old guitar looking for a bounty. It has a twist at the end.). I suggest you at LEAST look at it, and I recommend buying it.Later Space Cowboy"
3,Headphones work great...Headset for cell phones not the best,"The headset works great playing music from my MP3 player, however the microphone for the cell phone is less than great. Many people that I have talked to while using the headset state that they cannot hear me clearly."
5,Castles,"""Castles"" by Philip Steele, published by Kingfisher, is a wonderful glance into medieval life. Although written for children, this book will appeal to adults as well. ""Castles"" can provide a special reading time between parent and child. The historical information is presented in a colorful, easy reading format accompanied by beautiful illustrations and well-researched descriptions. Timelines, photographs, and artwork allow the reader to learn many aspects in an entertaining manner. ""Castles"" encompasses the social system, heraldry, knighthood, and lifestyles of the time period. This book provides a detailed glimpse into the past. Originally, I purchased this book for my nephew, but I will be acquiring a copy in the future for myself and my children. To anyone who wants to encourage their child to learn about this time frame in history, this book is perfect. By the way, I think this book will be a good time for a parent to spend reading with their child."
5,must read for introspective students,Reminescent of Joseph Campbell. Deep insight into the importance of being.
2,Miss Butterworth is no Miss Marple,"I wish people wouldn't compare Miss Butterworth to Miss Marple. Miss Marple is a likeable character who is very astute concerning human nature and is a humble person. Miss Butterworth is haughty, snobbish and nosy. I didn't like her at all. I also found the Victorian-era dialogue off-putting."
5,great beds,These beds are even better than I hoped for at this price. My dogs curled up in them as soon as they were out of the bags.
5,great bed,"my dog loves this bed. it is very sturdy and she loves the pillow around the edge. my dog is about 50 lbs and there is plenty of room for her, so it would be good for a larger dog as well."
4,Funny stuff!,We were first introduced to Patrick F. McManus' works by my father-in-law. They are interesting to say the least and often knee slapping funny. I recommend them to anyone who likes good wholesome humor.
1,they dont work,These gloves get luke warm at best and that is stretching the truth. Returning them is a very frustrating process and takes too long to do. It seems as though they don't really want you to return things here.
4,For a gift,I gave this as a gift to my sister-in-law and she really likes it to go skiing and snowboarding. The battery pack is easy to use.
2,Don't bother . . .,"When I purchased a pair of these gloves a couple of years ago, I had high hopes. My hands become cold easily, and I was looking forward to wearing gloves that would actively help in warming them.I will admit that these gloves are respectable as normal, unheated gloves. They are fairly well insulated and provide a moderate degree of dexterity.However, the heating element is ineffective. Inserting batteries into the gloves provided little (if any) increase in warmth. My fingers remained cold.In addition, I have recently discovered that the thin wire connecting the heating element to the battery in one of the gloves has become disconnected. These gloves have not been subjected to any harsh abuse, so it is disappointing to find that the wire had been disconnected so easily.If you are looking for a pair of heated gloves that will actually make a difference and keep your hands (including your fingers)warm, look elsewhere."
4,Great sound at a good price,I think Fluance products sound great and priced right. I wasn't looking for the loudest or cheapest home theatre system. I just got this subwoofer and love how subtle the bass range is. It comes with metal floor spikes (and metal pads). I have a set of Fluance speakers and I'm glad I didn't buy a cheaper subwoofer. This a great price for a low frequency sub. It includes shipping. I think you'll be happy with Fluance.
1,Bad service,"I ordered my product from Kegworks on 12/7. I quickly received a confirmation e-mail afterwards. My order did not ship till 12/14 at which point I did not receive any e-mail confirmation. When I called to inquire about my order, the customer service was clueless. Poor service all around. I will never order from this company ever again."
4,GRANNY DEAREST...,"When Melinda Rice returns to Silverhill, her mother's ancestral home, upon her death, her goal is not only to bury her mother in the family plot, but to bury the past, as well. Something had happened to Melinda at Silverhill many years ago that had left her scarred her physically. She seeks to discover the truth about what happened to her and to deliver a cryptic message from her mother to her aunt.Unfortunately, Melinda's grandmother rules Silverhill with an iron fist, and all there bow to her will. When she arrives, she is barely acknowledged and is made to feel unwelcome. Still, Melinda is determined to stay until she has accomplished what she has set out to do. Until such time, she will not leave Silverhill. There are, however, forces afoot that are equally determined that Melinda should not stay.This is an enjoyable novel of romantic suspense by one of the doyennes of the genre and well worth reading."
2,Middle of the road,"I bought this book because it came up as a recommendation based on previous purchases. While that fact may have led me to want the book to be better than it was, I tried to approach the book with an open mind.Overall, this book was neither good nor bad, just typical The author's writing style is fine for the genre. It did suffer from the fact that all the characters tend to sound the same in the dialogue. The plot is basic witch meets vampire and they are chased by baddies thinking they are good.Basically, this book was safe for the author to write. Upon learning that this was Hallaway's first book, I do hold some hope that her later works will change in a way to push them beyond middle of the road. This book, however, is a bit of a snooze in the middle of the road. Personally, I prefer Mindy L. Klasky's series."
3,A pleasant bit of fluff,"This book was enjoyable, but a little weak and more fluff than substance. The main character is good, but I was not impressed with her love interest or the story line."
5,Excellent book for my daughter & her dad!,"I bought the first book in this series as an extra gift and my daughter now anxiously awaits every new edition. I've also read all 3 so far and really enjoyed them. They're ""real"" books, not shallow or fantastic, but absolutely captivating. I highly recommend the entire series."
1,Pregame stuff after game,Pre-game stuff often shows up after the game has been played. I have not heard from them in more than five days.
3,Thief of Lives,"Thief of lives continues where Dhampir left off, Magiere, Leesil and Chap are now living in Miishka and running their own Tavern/Inn when a letter comes for Magiere. Seems the folks of Bela have been plagued with some undeads themselves, and some people have been getting killed. Bela needs help and has called upon Magiere and Leesil to eradicate the Noble Dead.The writing style is the same, some good, witty quips some nice fighting scenes and plot twists. There was no downtime or lag that I came across, the story is engaging and characters intriguing. The new noble dead they face each have their own story and personalities (except for Sapphire who was just a major pain in the butt) we learn more about Leesils past, as well as some interesting tidbits about Chap.How's the romance? Well, nonexistent, and that is okay! I don't like it when sappy romance or needless romance gums up my action. However, the end did make me smile and I am actually looking forward to the next book."
4,Thief of Lives is great second novel,Leesil and Magiere move closer to their destiny in this new installment. The story line flows very well and we are atonce caught up in the adventure and horror they must face. Leesil learns more about himself and Magiere is trying tocome to grips about what she is. A slow romance starts to unfold between them...which should heat up in the next book!!!
5,Charlotte Reigns !,"If I were booted to an island and could only take 5 DVD's, I'd take 5 copies of the Charlotte Church DVD, to ensure I'd never be without at least one copy. I got goosebunps the first time I saw/heard it,and 6 months later,it still knocks me out. Charlotte's command of her voice and her audience is something even seasoned pros would be smart to examine.To anyone with any sensitivity or love for music will go nuts over this feast for the eyes and ears."
5,Voice of An Angel,"God and his Angels weep for joy everytime Charlotte Church sings.I have had the fortune to travel and hear many of the greatest singers of the 20th century and none can compare with the voice of this young lady from Wales.Being of Celtic ancestry myself may prejudice my thinking somewhat, but her voice speaks for itself. Magnificent!I know that she will only become more acomplished as she matures and anyone who says otherwise is sadly mistaken."
1,use-value?,"Nice hypothesis to mangle Marxian theory of use/exchange value into the semiotics of signifier/signified sign equivelance, but it's this kind of rubbish that allowed the ridiculous terminologies of postmodernism to get a foothold in the bastion of tertiary education.A nice laugh for those who know better.A red herring for those who don't."
2,She was nice for a while,"Unfortunatly this doll isn't very durable and only lasted for a few months. She's pretty, though, and if you collect Bratz, and leave them in the box then i guess this is okay."
4,Jessie got nothing on Harry,"Great album, so will focus on the few negatives. ""Don'tcha Go ""Way Mad"" should have been an instrumental!! The ""singer"" must have been a band member who drew the short straw!---Awful!The vocalists on ""Star Dust"" and ""Body and Soul"" were, to be nice, sounded like losers on American Idol..""Things Ain't What They Used To Be"" great tune, but here was tired and draggy!Especially liked "" Hurry"", "" Lamond and Mon"" and of course ""Two O"" and "" Ultra"""
4,cool as hell,"I was looking to wear something to the gym and also when i jog on the tread mill specifically, also the sound quality is good, will challenge any stero phonic head phone, the neckline of the headset is foldable, one can fold them and slip them in your pocket and looks cool when u wear them, So 2 thumbs up from me atleast"
5,Thought provoking and entertaining,"Dennett has written a very thought provoking analysis of how free will is compatible with determinism, clearing away the bug bears and myths, by analysins just what we mean by 'choice' 'can' and 'inevitable'.Definitely the leading book on the subject."
5,"Go Spidey, Go!","This is a great music cd for little kids. (Well, maybe not for those in kindergarten or older, they might think they're too mature for this.) If you're an older spider-man fan, you will either love or hate this cd. I however, love it. It was completely worth the $1 I spent for it. All the songs are pretty good, but my favorite songs are Spidey's On The Fire Truck, Do What Spider-Man Tells You To Do and Dancin' With Spider-Man And Friends. The only sad thing about this CD is that it doesn't come with a lyric booklet. Despite this, however, the lyrics are clear, catchy, and easy to remember."
2,Do not play these songs on your Boombox!,I thought I could appreciate kiddie music and that these would be the most tolerable of the bunch. But....
2,Don't waste your time or money,"I don't mean to sound harsh, however, I wish that I had read the reviews before I purchased this book. The title and story line sounded beyond intriguing, however, the book was far from that. I am not quite sure how a person is supposed to learn about the psychology of serial killers in this book when the majority of the book is a compilation of convicted murderers claiming their innocence. Out of the 306 pages and 14 serial killers I found only one to be somewhat informational. Although the testimony of David Gore was at times hard to read I felt that his confessions were the only ones that allowed a person to get another glance into the mind of a serial killer. My suggestion would be to go to the bookstore, find this book, spend a few minutes to read the David Gore letters and then put it back on the shelf before you waste your money."
1,What A Yawn! Extremly Redundant and Disappointing...,"I read the reviews, but decided to purchase the book anyway. I was hoping for ""A Penetrating Look Inside the Minds of Murderers"", but instead I got more of the same...send photos, visit and most disappointing none of her letters were in the book. The reader had no idea what Furio wrote in her letters.Also disturbing to me, being a mother, she freely sent photos of herself and her family! She seemed to like the compliments she was receiving from these inmates on her looks. Your not all that Jennifer! Stick to being a mom."
5,one of the best hair care products out there,I dont usually use designer hair products but I recieved a liter of this product from a friend and fell in love with it. The product is not sticky or goopy but rather light and clear with a very clean smell which appeals to us who cant tolerate heavy fragrances. The shampoo has a nice lather and washes away clean. I like that my hair does not feel weighed down or oily. Another perk is that Paul Mitchell is dedicated to protect against animal cruelty by using plant based ingredients and not testing on animals.
5,Perfect for X-Box,My 12-year-old son had the network extender hooked up and running in minutes! Easiest and most economical option for adding a wireless connection to our wired home network.
2,hmm....nice but generic,The shoes are nice and my son loved them when he first stared wearing them but i purchaced these due to the lights that lit up cause i think that light up shoes are cute on kids but ive only had these shoes for about a month and the lights have stopped working already one shoe already which now looks funny when he wears them and walks cause only 1 shoe lights up so i wouldnt recommend you buy these for the lights.
5,Excellent resource,I am responsible for administration at a 150 employee company. This book explains all the legal issues facing a business like ours and has a full range of document templates that are very useful. I wish I had purchased this book years ago. Great book!
5,Great product,This is a great item thank you for sending it out promptly it arrived in excellent condition I look forward to doing business with you
4,The Missionary Position,Great book. With a razor wit Chris Hitchens shows the dark side of the Mother Teresa phenomenon. Instead being a savior of the downtrodden and dispossesed Mother Teresa comes off as advocate for the conservative branch of the Catholic Church. It also raises a question about the amount of money her organization receives while her patients ( or victims in some cases ) live in squalid conditions. This book should be required reading for anybody taken in by the Teresa for Sainthood bandwagon.
1,Bigotry,I worked in one of the MC's hospices in seminary. They took in those no one else does and do work that no one else will. I bet the author has never changed an AID's patients diaper. I also bet the other critics haven't done it either. When I see them taking over Mother Teresa's good work then they have the right to be critical. I never saw such hard working and dedicated women as those nuns. Certainly the Indian people have expressed their love for Mother Teresa during her funeral. These critics are typical liberals who hate the church for opposing their anti-child and anti-family policies. I guess my main question to them would be how many children have you saved?
5,"Relgious People, Why Don't you Read the Book Before you Write a Review?","Hitchens writes with clarity, and an eye for brevity. This is a poignant look at the way that an image can overwhelm a society so much that it takes an author like Hitchens to point out what should have been obvious to everyone. It takes Hitchens less than a hundred pages to point out the hypocritical stances, and the cruelty of the one know as Mother Teresa."
1,Smells like (cough) journalism.,"Well, it seems anti-catholicism is everywhere these days. First John Cornwell's ""Hitler's Pope"" now this wonderful book. I guess the ""enlightened"" people of the Nobel Prize commitee must not be as smart as we thought. After all, they actually gave Mother a Nobel Peace Prize. I suppose Martin King and Albert Einstein must have been frauds too, or perhaps Hitchens (like Cornwell) may a few facts crossed. I'm just glad there is a generation of Catholic Apologists who can shed light on this type of ""investigative jouirnalism""."
2,I question Christopher Hitchens credibility,"I used to work for Gift of Love, Mother Teresa's Aids Hospice in San Francisco. What Christopher Hitchens reports about the hospice is completely untrue. We administered pain medication on demand. Our hospice was highly recommended by UCSF's Aids clinic and all of the AIDS organization in SF. We had a long waiting list of AIDS patients trying to get in. Public Health Nurses would work on a daily basis at the hospice and were highly supportive of its operation. In this one area, Christopher Hitchens seems to have purposefully sought out people who would support his side of the story. Such deterministic reporting makes me wonder about the accuracy of the rest of his book. The title reflects his bias. Hilary Kotter"
1,Pessemist,"Christopher Hitchens is getting at an interesting point, but I don't like the way he puts absoluteley everything against Mother Teresa. She did several wonderful things, although like everyone else,she made mistakes. As the priest of our church says ""look to the future, not the past."
4,A man may lose his head...,"Maigret does an audacious thing at the beginning of this book. He arranges for a condemned man to escape from his cell.All the evidence points to the man's guilt, yet Maigret does not believe the simple fellow can be guilty of viciously stabbing to death a rich old lady and her companion. He didn't even know the victims, and he stole nothing from them.What diabolical puppeteer is hiding behind the scenes, plotting events, contriving scenes and pulling everyone's strings?This Maigret mystery is a fascinating study of how the warped personality of a killer can get under the skin of the investigator.Simenon thought a novel should be concise enough to read in one sitting. I suggest reading A Man's Head in one sitting if you can, to experience fully the mounting tension of tracking down the killer."
4,Adjustible Wood Bit,The good points of the Irwin Lockhead Adjustable Wood Bit is that it gives you the ability to drill holes to your specific requirements.The bad point is not really bad but the bit is a little difficult to adjust to get an exact hole size. There is a gague on the bit but it is only a rough measurement for the diameter that you need. To get an exact size you need to drill a hole and measure the diameter and adjust the bit until you get the size needed. This bit is not balanced because of the offset to the adjustible cutter so it needs to be used in a drill press at slow speed.
2,Terrible Bedtime Stories,"This book has legends from various cultures, many of which are violent and do not contain a moral. This is the worst bedtime story book I've ever purchased."
4,"Excellent format for DVD, great music and action",Good cast and excellent music make this DVD a good purchase. Kim Yates is hot! Setting really adds to the film. Playboy should focus attention towards this type of production in the future.
3,Charles Todd's books,I love Charles Todd's Ian Rutledge books! The Murder Stone was just OK. Didn't measure up to his other books.
3,I spent half of the book going HUH?,"In my opinion, Charles Todd is usually one of the best 5 mystery writers today. I enjoy his books because they are well-written...usually. This one meandered all over the place. I wonder if it was because he was trying to write it from mainly a woman's point of view. I really enjoy his other books, so this was a big letdown.I figured the missing mother was going to come into the story alive, somewhere along the line. So much time was spent on the mutual angst of the two characters. Nobody moans that much, and has someone stick around to listen to it.The second half picked up somewhat, and I really enjoyed the snippets by each of the brothers ... their take on their childhood, and on World War I. It was partly because of Todd I became interested in WWI. I am really hoping the next one is more like his original series...Karen Sadler"
5,Hebrew Word Pictures,A great aid in helping you learn Hebrew. Easy to follow and understand the Hebrew alphabet. This is an excellent starter book.
5,Got lucky with this one,Bought this as second hand and was concerned since there was no picture from a relatively new seller. Since I could return it if needed I went ahead and ordered it.Lo and behold it was like new alright. Best part is that it was the more desirable C series and was dated 1973. Didn't even appear to be broken in. These are desirable because of a better trigger and higher valve output (more power).Current collector value is about 75.00 more than I paid. I'll keep it for sure.
2,Frustrating and anger-inducing waste of time...,"As a gamer since age 9 (when I first saw Asteroids in an arcade) I have played and beaten hundreds of games. Battlestar Galactica is so frustrating that I put it away after 9 attempts to get through level 1! Yes, LEVEL 1! I just stopped caring. Any game that forces you play through the SAME 15 minutes of gameplay every time you die towards the end of a level is a waste of my time. No save points. No mid-mission saves. I could be out making money, or going on a date or playing something that's actually fun and rewarding. What makes me so mad about Galactica is the fact that the graphics/sounds are really well done...that and the fact that I have waited 29 years to fly a Viper in a video game and when I finally do, I want to forget the name Battlestar Galactica altogether. Strictly for the sadists out there. I just finished the game BLACK and found it to be a walk in the park compared to this game....Look for my copy used online."
1,Not too good...,"Im not a proffesional video game player, but I just didn't like the fact that if one doesn't finish the level completely, you'll have to start the whole level over. I understand the realism factor, but it's just a game."
3,not as good as My Very First Book of Numbers,"We checked this one out of the library after buyingMy Very First Book of Numbers. Unfortunately, it's not quite as good. First of all, although black, white, pink, and brown are represented, the color orange is missing - how can you skip one of the secondary colors?! Secondly, at least in the copy we saw, the fire engine is a muddy color somewhere in between red and brown (and definitely does not match the bright red color square). Finally, it would have been nice if the colors had been arranged in the order of the spectrum rather than randomly. This really had potential, but fell short."
1,Should Be an Article,"I agree with ""A Reader from Oslo."" I have never seen a book with such large type (the capital letters in sentences are around 5/16"" tall!!!) and empty space (around 1/4"" between lines!!!). I can stand four feet away and still easily read the pages.I actually looked to see if somehow I received a special edition for persons who are visually impaired. Nope."
1,A poor value proposition,"Like most of the other reviewers, I am disappointed. Too much of the overly large print on small pages was wasted on anecdotes. Far too little was spent on facts. It would be an easy deduction that the author spent time in the legal profession solely from the repeated disclaimers, hedged opinions and references about cultural relativity.The only tidbits I found worthwhile were the references to more fundamental source material."
1,"Amanda Lanning, no it isn't","When I first saw snippets of this show on pay tv/cable I was thinking ""This is awful reality junk,"" that was all I was thinking. Now it's a good thing Free to air in Australia hasn't picked it up and is too concerned with Big Brother and s*it like that. This is not the greatest show on TV as far as I know (24 and Family Guy are better) so Amanda Lanning is wrong. Avoid this and MTV. Amanda, reality is not TV, you're probably thinking this is."
2,Its old news,"From what I read, I was expecting this to be a recent edition of the book, not one that is 12 years old."
