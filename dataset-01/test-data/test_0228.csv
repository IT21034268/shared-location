5,"Excelent, not just for Halo fans!","I have to admit im very biased towards military sci fi. Its hard for me to review this book without mentioning Starship Troopers and Enders Game (which are oustanding), Fall of Reach is in the same vein and it has and excelent flow, the pages just keep turning themselves. To be perfectly honest I found that the game seriously lagged at the end, but this book most definately does not, it helps to put the whole Halo universe in perspective and it's a fun read, it could just as easly stand on it's own."
5,Great book,Halo fans if your looking for a great book and the beginning of master chief's story this a book i recommend.
3,"If you liked the game, read the book","Halo: The Fall of Reach is better than you would expect from your average computer game adaptation. The plot, though nothing special in itself, is at least well thought out. The writing is not fantastic, but it could be much worse. Still, an interesting read. Some of the training of the SPARTANs is somewhat unrealistic at points, and the military discipline they exhibit tends to be overbearing; sometimes it's just plain incorrect. If you liked the game for its story as well as its graphics and gameplay, give it a shot. Don't expect a masterpiece."
3,Actually pretty good?,"Cobrawas the first of a series about medically ""improved"" warriors. In this book the plot also involves wars in space that remind one ofInvaders from the Infinitewhich is one of the oldest space operas from the 30's. Earth is behind in a war with an Alien confederation/ society and must come up with new weapons fast or have all their planets ""glassed"". This book is obviously a serial type ofwars in space with a hero who is ""designed"" to be a deadly killer.Dark Angel - The Complete Seriesis about a girl much like John 117 in this novel, but done better? Eric Nylund has done pretty good on a writing ""contract"" here, but it could have been better."
4,A Fine Addition to Military Sci-Fi,"I have not really played Halo, but after hearing several people who have absolutely rave about the books I decided to check them out. I was not disappointed. One small problem I did have was with the editing. There were several typos (ie colleges instead of colleagues)which tend to take me out of the story.If you are a fan of Robert Heinlien'sStarship Troopersor Warhammer 40KHorus Rising (The Horus Heresy)or even Frank Herbert'sDune (Dune Chronicles, Book 1)you will greatly enjoy this book. Also, fans of ancient history and mythology will love all the names and references that pay homage to the ancients."
5,Ten Inch Hero,I am a Supernatural fan and wanted to watch because of Jensen Ackles. This is quirky movie that I enjoyed very much. The movie new arrived on time and packaged great. I would order from this company again.
3,Cute,"It is a feel good movie, that I definetly would not go to the theaters to watch. I had never heard of it, until I saw that Jensen Ackles was on it. I think he is a great actor, who has done a lot of growth on Supernatural, so I wanted to see him outside the show. I thought he was great, and not just him. The main characters in the movie did a great job with their acting, as opposed to some of these other movies where the acting sucks but they still get all the praise.Maybe too many story lines for such a short period of time, they could have been developed a little better, but overall a movie I would not mind sitting on my couch and watching again with some pop corn and some girlfriends."
1,Does not seam to last,"Picked one in Lowes, and it worked buitifully but only for ~ 5 sharpenings. It seams that metal plates easily ware out. However, at the cost of a few dollars - should anyone complain?"
4,Good bang for buck,"What more can I say? The little money you pay for this little rig is just fine. If you only need to touch up your blades, this is all you need. If the blade needs more, or you are just,""Hard Core"", you may need a stone, or pro sharpening."
4,Anything that can put an edge on a dull machete is good in my book,"Had and old dull machete sitting around the house, and wanted to make sure it was sharp for camping this summer. Picked this sharpener because it was well priced and the reviews were good. Well, the machete now has a clean edge, able to hack and slash through anything. The carbide side created the basic edge and the ceramic honed to a nice sharpness."
4,Worked Like A Champ,"Our kitchen knives were pretty dull after about a year of use. Bought this item becuse it was cheap. Sharpened all of my kitchen knives and it worked really well. All the knives now have a razor sharp edge. The sharpener, when it came in seemed to be a little small, but size doesnt always make the product better. I would reccomend this to anyone in need of sharpening straight edge knives."
5,A very useful tool,This small tool worked perfectly for my need and I would recommend it to my other friends and neighbors soon
2,Gothic Blue,This was one of the very few Black Lace books that I didn't finish. The story line was strange and it was drawn out. There are a lot better ones out there. The Gallery or The Tutor.
3,Very random,"Some interesting stories. Some very boring stories. A few seem like they would only be interesting to other doctors, which is fine, as it is written by doctors. Very badly edited, which is why I called it random. The stories are just thrown together. At one point, in the middle of the book, there is what reads as an introduction to the purpose of the book. It would have been appropriate at the beginning of the book. Some of the stories just end, with no explanation or conclusion--they don't make any sense.As another reviewer stated, this doesn't work very well on a kindle. Some stories were written in very tiny writing on background pictures, which made it impossible to read. The supposed ""ads"" are mostly stupid and childish.It seems that this book was just thrown together hurriedly to make a buck."
2,I sure hope this is farce...,"I sure hope this is farce. It reads like a bunch of articles written by the doctors of the several people I know who have been turned away by their doctors for being hypochondriacs (or worse, in case of the several ""my favorite Munchausen"" sections of this book), only to turn out to have incurable bone cancer, breast cancer, giant ovarian cysts, and blocked up gall bladders. If the first doctor had not called up the specialist for a laugh (see the ""new doctor vs. old doctor"" list), these conditions may have been caught before they reached the critical or fatal stage. Read this if you want to get inside the head of the doctor who told you that you're fat and lazy rather than the one who caught finally ""caught"" your 40-pound tumor (true story)."
1,Where are all these accesories??? TERRIBLE QUALITY!!!,We bought this for our 4 1/2 year old daughter and are very disappointed. The floor on the fold out part is all bubbled (it's a sticker) and there are not all the items that you think are included. The box is very decieving. Good thing I opened it before giving it and bought some extra accessories. At least I thought good thing until she tried to put the babies on the rocking horses and they just keep flipping off or won't fit at all (one of their legs won't open wide enough to fit!. The drawers on the changing table cannot be opened by a child (not even our 9 year old) and have to be opened by us. Very upsetting gift. Lots of fustration here. I even called MGA and got NO help at all. I would not recommend this toy at all.
3,more like 2 1/2 stars,"this book was good, but not great. mr. roth does a great job in telling the story but he fails in presenting the story to the reader. mr. roth includes very little dialogue in the book. either he feels it isn't needed or he is insecure about his capabilities to write meaningful conversations. his characters barely speak, and when they do, they rarely say anything of substance. mr. roth's descriptions of people and items are extraordinary at times but it is not enough to carry the interest of his audience. the second half of the book is much more interesting than the first half and it rescued me from waving the white flag on the whole experience. if you can, purchase this one in the bargain books section."
4,Sterling Silver Ring,"This ring is a great item for the price. It is very comfortable, and the sizing is accurate."
3,half and half,I ordered 2 rings at different times. I love its size. Its a good fit. My only problem is that they seem to have a different finish. One is shiny and the other is dull. But it came fast and is a good price.
1,Why?,"I'm a huge fan of lance's movement and will be taking the livestrong challenge next year.... but you can buy these bands for $1 a piece on the official website. I dont think all the money is going to the foundation from here, someone else is getting a $2 profit on the bands. Please support the actual company and the fight for cancer, not companies on amazon making double profits on these."
5,Great product,"All you need to be a fan and support Lance's fight. The quality is excellent resistant to daily sun, water and professional outdoor and sportsman"
3,Duffy and the Devil?,"This tells a cute story similar to the traditional version of Rumplestiltskin that is familiar to many of us. The watercolor illustrations are the perfect companion to this text as they are subtle with their opaqueness, yet still tell so much by themselves. Because the book deals with the devil and also some witches, it may not be appropriate for all audiences. Due to the difficulty of the, at times, archaic grammar and length of the text, students shouldn't be expected to read this independently until the 3rd grade, but can have it read to them at a younger age.Why 3 stars?:I felt the portrayal of the Devil in this story was an element that could have been eliminated. The character could have been named something else or taken on a different persona. Also, although the book did win a Caldecott Award, it failed to grab my attention, and the attention of the first and second graders that I tested it with."
2,duffy did nothing for me,"I was not very impressed by this book. I felt that the language was, at times, confusing and inappropriate for young readers. The illustrations, while better than anyhting I could do, were not outstanding."
5,Liked this book for lerning the older software.,Started going through this book. Lots of great training information well written. One of my favorites for learning dynamic website creation and development.
3,From the Source means literally that,"I just noticed that the Macromedia ""Training from the Source"" series bear a striking resemblence to the pdf manuals that are available with Macromedia products. That is, anyone can log onto the Macromedia (now Adobe) web site, and access their ""manuals"" in pdf format free of charge. This and other training from the source manuals appear to be rewrites of these basic manuals. I am not faulting Macromedia, as this makes sense from a business perspective.However, this series, like the basic free manuals appear to be rather basic, rudementary and cover the topics in a dry corporate tech writer manner. Few illustrations, little use of colors, etc. This series is OK, and even expected in a free manual, but I expect a little more for a purchased printed and bound book.Overall this book is certainly adequate, but in my experience many other series are a better value."
2,Not well cut,"We got this for my 5 year old son who loves puzzles. The picture is nice and the cardboard is good quality but to my surprise one piece was missing (no, we didn't loose it on the floor) and at least 6 pieces were ""doubles"" - not cut properly. I was very surprised because we have had no problems with Melissa and Doug products in the past."
1,"Another derivative, cookie cutter Cornwell clone.","There's nothing new here. Just the same old stuff you'll find in Patricia Cornwell's worst books (only not as skillfully written) and in dozens of other books trying to emulate her success.You've got an improbably perfect female coroner, flirting with an ex, a small town that hides secrets (worst cliche of all ) and both graphic physical and sexual violence involving kids in an attempt to shock and titillate (and sell books) from a safe distance. It's so shallow and the mystery so contrived and obvious that I have no doubt it will hit the bestseller lists so everyone who reads it can feel good about deploring the violence it depicts (all the while loving every juicy detail). I'd rather read a book with more insight into real human behavior or with something braver to say."
3,Very gory.,"I HAVE ENJOYED SEVERAL BOOKS IN THE GRANT COUNTY SERIES.THIS ONE WAS VERY DETAILED IN TOO MANY WAYS.DEFINITELY NOT FOR ANYONE WITH A WEAK STOMACH.WISH THER WAS A WAY TO GET THESE BOOKS IN SOME TYPE OF SEQUENCE.I HAVE TRIED YEAR OF PUBLICATION,THAT HAS NOT WORKED.THE AUTHOR SEEMS TO GO BACK AND PICK UP ANOTHER STORY LINE,WHICH CAN RUIN IT AS FAR AS THE TIMELINE GOES."
3,Not entirely unpleasant,"This is the second book I have read by Karin Slaughter. I found both books very easy to get through (about 2 days each). I did find both of the books pretty predictable though. I figured out who the bad guy was pretty soon. I didn't think either book was really great but they were okay. Like I said, pretty easy to get through. I guess I'll have to read the third installmant to see if she keeps with her pattern."
5,Taste of the 20's,"What a movie !!!! What a cast !!!! Anthony Edwards, Robert Mithchum, Mary Kay Place, Anjelica Huston, Harry Dean Stanton, Lauren Bacall and so many more..... What a great idea to have a novie that says to kids.....you can try something out once,but it may not work. If it does great but always be on the lookout for things not to work. It was great."
1,Same old stuff,"Morton has nothing new to add to Diana's story except perhaps to promote himself and his earlier books on the Princess. He also seems to have a personal vendetta against Paul Burrell, Diana's butler, and never wastes an opportunity to make a nasty crack about him. Do not waste any money on this book!"
1,"Same Old stuff, nothing new!!! don't buy it",This book has all the old stuff everyone already knew. Morton must be lacking of money that's why he is trying to make some out of the poor princess. Please do not waste your money on this book. Please do not waste your time and money
3,NO COLOR PHOTOS!!!!!!!!,I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE READ ABOUT THIS BOOK MORE CAREFULLY. I WAS EXPECTING NICE RICH COLORFUL PICTURES AND TO MY DISMAY THERE WERE NONE! ALL PHOTOGRAPHS ARE IN BLACK AND WHITE. 5 STARS I GUESS FOR THE CONTENT OF THE TEXT BUT 0 STARS FOR THE PHOTOS. SO DISSAPOINTING. POTENTIAL BUYERS PLEASE TAKE NOTE!
2,Down for the Count,"What could go wrong with a movie written and directed by Charles Chaplin starring Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren? Well, everything. The plot may have had some possibilities but none of it emerged with any coherancy. There were scenes that were supposed to be funny but were merely embarassing (consider the scene with the cigar smoke and ask yourself, Why?). The acting was uninspired and that's hard to say about Marlon Brando. I was disappointed in everyone although I understood Chaplin's purpose; he spotlighted his offspring although they were uninspiring as well. Even the two songs he composed for the movie were played too much. I'll continue to watch other works of Charlie Chaplin and Marlon Brando because I know what they're capable of. Unfortunately, ""The Countess from Hong Kong"" has shown me what else they're capable of."
1,"Thick and long, but oh the smell!!!","I ordered this mat three weeks ago and was very eager to try it out when it arrived. However upon opening the packaging, a horrible penetrant rubbery smell filled my nostrils. It was so bad, that I didn't dare to bring the mat to my yoga practice, as I was afraid that the smell would prevent me from being able to concentrate, and even more, that it would bother others. I washed the mat by hand and the smell is a bit less potent, but I still keep this mat for my at home practice of yoga only. If you don't mind the smell, the mat is very thick and long, and the design is cute, but for me it was a waste of money."
2,Not the same as the anime,"If you are looking for a printed version of the FLCL anime, you won't get it here. Other than the character names and small bits of the plot, the manga version bears no resemblance to the anime. I won't outline the story here because, well, I can't. Let's just say that the manga is more of a surreal exercise in style rather than a coherent story."
2,2 stars for the drawings,"The artwork for this manga is pretty interesting to me, but after reading 2 volumes, I feel I have wasted my money as far as the story goes. The story is totally incoherent, and I have heard from people that watching the anime is the only way to understand the manga (which I feel makes for bad manga) and so I cannot reccomend this manga as a stand alone product. I've watched a lot of anime and read a fair amount of manga, and so I'm able to put together even strange stories... however this manga has almost no story and jumps around so much that nothing is ever developed."
4,Four Stars for Creativity!,"Ah, this is an imaginative book, to be certain.Though I've not yet been honored with the chance to watch the anime, I've heard that the manga greatly differs from it. So if you're looking for a follow-up or the manga-version of the original shows, you'd best stay away.Listen, if you're the type to love by-the-book mangas and that type of art style, you'd better prepare yourself for this. The storyline is incredibly, there's no other way to say this, WHACKY. The art can also, at major points of action in the story, be scrawly and hard to follow. VERY hard to follow. Well, you were warned.I personally find the art style cute, especially Mamimi (she's a dear ^^). Being totally new to this, this manga was my first experience with Fooly Cooly, I was wholly bamboozled and pleased with this purchase (well, gift, really). All in all, this book, in it's onesome, has greatly diversified my 63-book collection. Thanks, FlCl ^^!"
2,Atkins is soooo much better,"I purchased this product because its very comparible to the Atkins shakes, but less money. Boy, you get what you pay for. I had trouble mixing it. I even used my power mixer and it still clumps. The taste is a bit gritty. Finally, I took a suggestion off of this review site and made it like hot chocolate. Well, the powder mixed up this time and does taste a bit better, almost like sugar free hot cocoa. I would not recommend this product. I was using the Atkins shakes and thought I could save some cash, but, they are much tastier and mix without any grit. Just my opinion."
1,deficient in both quality and quantity,"The book gives incomplete instructions about adding sound and graphics, incomplete instructions about linking from one card to another, and no instructions at all about entering, testing, and exiting the program.The suggested projects aren't red hot either. When I see a computer file which abounds with scroll bars, I wonder why the author didn't write hard copy instead.The book is 64 pages long. That comes out to about 6 pages per dollar."
4,whoa,"Thats all I can say about this. My mom is actually the one that checked this movie out. I really enjoyed it. I agree with everyone else that It really feeling like your watching these girls life and they dont know it. I like the way OUR SONG just tell an honest story about three NYC girls and their everyday lives living in Crown Heights,Brooklyn. Even though this movie is rated R(for language and some teen drug use)it is safe for kids of all ages to see it. Its not just a chick flick. Im a guy and I liked it. This movie combines poverty, friendship, boys, hard choices, and teen pregnancy in one. Well check it out for yourselves. bye. im out. I admit that the movie was hard to keep up with but it was still an awsome movie."
4,As real as real can get,This movie is as real as real can get.It was tape in my area. But be warned that when you are done looking at this movie you will be moved.
4,Overlooked Gem,"Released on a limited basis around the United States, OUR SONG deserves a wider audience. It tells a honest and often moving story of three teenage girls in a marching band. All of the lead performances are strong, especially from newcomer Kerry Washington. Check it out."
2,Great story - incredibly bad editing,"I had a great deal of trouble getting through this book. The story is absorbing, the writing is vivid --- but the editing, to say the least, leaves something to be desired for a trade hardback. In the first 18 pages, I found ten serious editorial errors, including left-out apostrophes (""the Mullahs men"") and hyphens (""off white"", ""five day""), misspelled names (""Addidas"", ""Dusseldorf""), misinflections (an image of an eagle ""rung"" with a circular band), and, unbelievably, an incorrect conversion from kilometers to miles. Such errors continue through the book. One cannot comfortably move with the flow of an author's prose when one's sensibilities are being continually assaulted by such barbarisms."
2,Wrong Design--I think,"I used this PQI 2GB SD 133X on my Canon SD450 digital. The card tend to be stuck to the slot when I ejecting it. I have to use the tweezers in order to pull it out. I think because the of PQI designed. One side of the card, the plastic is not smooth--therefore it tend to be stuck . My other 2 cards I have is Sandisk and Canon, I don't have any trouble ejecting them. But only this PQI, hence give it a 2 stars. Have tweezers nearby if you need to ejecting this card out ."
2,Not what I expected,"It was not what I was expecting. It was 95% reprints of old motorcycle reviews. If you read the reviews from 1969, 1970, 1971, etc. by the time you get to 1985 there is not much excitement. You might know year-to-year changes but not much else. Other than reviews there were two articles about rebuilding the top end."
4,ELENAS FAMOUS MEXICAN AND SPANISH RECIPES,"This cook book is a tried and true recipe book for authentic Mexican food. A friend told us about the book and we ordered a book for each daughter. The chili rellano recipe tastes like the first ones I ever ate in New Mexico. The binding is a bit stiff, and I wish I had ordered the spiral bound one. Great for Mexican food!ELENAS FAMOUS MEXICAN AND SPANISH RECIPES"
3,Property,"I was able to read the book. However, the condition I received it in was horrible. The front and back covers were filthy; covered with what look like dirt and some sticky substance. Fingerprints were all over it as well. I wiped the covers with a damp cloth before reading it. I enjoyed the book but it should have been wiped off before being mailed.Brenda"
3,"A few gems, but not a bad collection","I was lucky to pick this book up at a used bookstore. It's not a bad collection, and it shows the authors strengths and weaknesses as he honed his craft over the years. My favorite stories were ""Love Hurts"" (which is probably where his later novel Survivor sprang from), ""A New Life"" (a really cool vampire story that is very unique...something I've never seen done before) and the title story, ""Old Ghosts"" about a psychiatrist who tells the story of an old friend who was a dangerous sociopath and how the psychiatrist later married the guy's ex girlfriend...is he telling the story now out of guilt for cheating his friend? You'll be surprised. All in all, not a bad collection, but some of the stories are a little rough around the edges."
5,Great little letters,I use these on the headstocks of guitars I build. I have yet to have one fall off and I started using them in 07.The auto parts store I used to buy these at stopped selling them. I was fortunate to find them on Amazon and bought 40.00 worth of them.
4,Cuisinart CHM-BTR beater set,"These were replacement beaters to an approximate six-year-old Cuisinart Hand Mixer. They appear to work fine although I noticed tiny rust spots in a few areas after the first time I used and washed the beaters. I did not let them soak in standing water. This concerns me as my original set of beaters never developed rust spots. Again, they appear to work fine."
1,Do not purchase,"I just ordered these beaters as a replacement for my Cuisnart CHM-7 hand mixer. The beaters are no where near the quality of the original beaters. The replacement beaters are lighter in weight, not the heavy duty stainless steel the original beaters are. Not only that, but they do not stay in the mixer which is the problem trying to be solved for. And it looks like they cannot be returned as they are considered an ""in touch with food' item. Extremely disappointing."
2,Not happy with this Video,"I have a few of Leslie's other videos, my favorite is the Boot Camp and second favorite is 4 mile walk with Weighted Gloves. This video is 5 miles which is what I wanted for this winter but a bit too rah-rah and lacks what is in the Boot Camp video. She spends a lot of time talking to others on the set and mis-cues happen. I will give this video away and use the others I have."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"I thought I was buying another 5 mile walking CD. This workout interrupts the walking with stretch bands. Guess I am just not very coordinated. I was afraid I would trip while trying to move using the bands and walking. I wanted another version of her other 5 mile CD. This is not a very good cardio tape, but I guess if you want fake muscle building, you might like it. I prefer going to the gym to do weight training."
5,I did this workout today,"I did this workout today and I love it I sweat my butt right off I'm not completely out of shape but I am a thicker girl trying to tone up and look more defined this will definitely do it I love this dvd along with her 4 really big miles,Walk away your waistline,and Walk it off and Tone it up I simply Love leslie and I will continue to drink my water and eat healthfully thank you so much for bringing this new dvd out I love all the music associated with this dvd"
1,No more Leslie DVD's for me,I own quite a few of Leslie Sansone DVD's but I stopped buying them because I can't stand her constant talking and when there are men in the group she really acts goofy. I agree with a lot of other reviews that the moves are repetitive in all her DVD's. I really enjoy the walking and wish she would read these reviews and stop all the useless chatting by the time I was done with a walk I wanted to throw something at the TV. I have since moved on to using Stephanie Huckabee DVD's which I enjoy a lot more she is not a useless chatterbox and when I'm finished I don't feel like throwing something at the TV.
4,Motivating,"I was introduced to Leslie Sansone a few years ago and at that time really enjoyed the workout. As all of us I stopped and now several years later I've decided to really do something nice for my body without injurying myself. This DVD offers safe and effective moves that bring results. You can customize to fit your pace/needs. I personally enjoy the first three (3) miles. I also love this DVD because it doesn't require floor/mat work and YOU REALLY DO SEE RESULTS.Think about it when you go to the gym you are doing the same routine why not invest in a DVD and enjoy in the comforts of your own home, save the money and invest in new clothes."
4,Good workout,"This is a great workout. Like the breakdown of miles. My only negative would be is that if you do the whole five miles, you have to have a LOT of time, over and hour. That's most times hard to fit in, so I save it for my off day."
3,Fine if you don't plan on upgrading to XP,"This camera is listed as XP compatible but is not. It will work with Win 95,98,ME, and 2000 (the software will not install on Win 2000 but the camera driver will). Do not buy this camera if you plan on using XP. Instead go for one of their new cameras such as the PDC 2150 that just came out."
1,Fuzzy images,"I recently bought this camera for my 5 year old and I can't takea good picture with it. I have made sure the lens was clean, Iuse a tripod and the camera's self timer(to eliminate shake), andI have tried all kinds of lighting (even full sun light). I alsoused my nikon coolpix800 on vga mode (same resolution as thepolaroid) with the basic quality (super high jpeg compression).The images from the nikon were 1/3 the file size of the polaroidimages and the quality is far better. The nikon images aresharper even though the jpg compression is greater. Thepolaroid images are all blurry."
1,Disappointed! :(,"This camera was handed down to me, because it didn't work on my brother's computer, which uses windowsXP. Beware... It will not work with windowsXP. Well, I was very excited, because I already owned a PolaroidPDC640, which always gave me great pictures. I was very disappointed when I saw the quality of pictures this camera took. They are all blurry. It's almost looks like their is something smeared on the lens. I cleaned the lens, but still no improvement. If you want clear, crisp pictures... I do not recommend this camera, not even for online viewing. This one is going to my 6yr old."
4,Color Cure Car Polish with ChipStick Blue,"My husband has been looking for this product, thinking it might help to restore some of the faded areas on his Civic. He's used it once and, for a week or so, it looked much better. However, it did not seem to last as long as it should. He's going to try it again, in case he did not apply enough of it, or polish it just right. Other than that, it seems to be exactly what he was looking for."
1,its dumb,its electric? how about gas powered dirt bikes? huh? i highly recomend gas powered items. Like the pocket rocket! get a couple gas powered pocket rockets! you guys are pathetick!
3,Ryan's mom,"My 11-year old son loves this bike, but it does not keep the charge it reports to keep, especially if it is used on hills or dirt surfaces. We are finding that it needs to be re-charged every 1/2 hour which is very frustrating. Otherwise, it is very fast and very quiet, but the battery is not sufficient for a child's weight (mine is 85 lbs) and hills/dirt.I am certain the bike will run longer on flat paved surfaces - which is not realistic. Also, the bike is a lot shorter than we thought it would be, measurea about 3 ft when assembled. We like the bike, but are a little frustrated with needing to charge it every 1/2 hour. If am afraid we will not ever get much use out of it, but it is a good alternative to a gasoline dirt bike for an adventursome child"
4,missing battery charger,"the motorcicle is excellent , my son is very happy , the only problem was that it came without the battery charger so i had to buy a new one directly from the Razor company and it tooks more than a week to be in my house so my son couldnt use it for that long.ThanksJorge Majluf"
2,Great bike...at first,"As the title says - it was a great little dirt bike, at first. After two days, however the common problem came up. Many other reviewers said the same thing: the rear wheel seems to disengage from the chain drive. The chain is moving, but the rear wheel does not move. We sent it back for a refund, since the first one we got was dead on arrival, the box was beaten up, etc. The manufacturers are close to having a great product, but still need to do some more road testing and better packing for shipping. Bummer!"
5,Razor MX500 Dirt Rocket Electric Motocross Bike,This is the third MX500 we have purchased. All have given very good servce and are still going strong.
1,Dirt bike DUD!!,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son and after putting it together it didn't work. I bought it early as a Christmas present so the warranty ran out by the time winter was over and he was ready to use it. After putting it together there was a disconnected wire in the throttle which I had to find a razor dealer to repair. Brand new, never used and already an extra $40.00 charge. After that it ran for a while and now it will not hold a charge. I read other reviews and decided I will not go through the exercise of buying a new battery which is about $90.00 without tax. I highly recommend not buying this dirt bike!!!"
1,Works great.......for a while.,This bike worked great for a the first four months and then quit. The warranty is only for 90 days. I called Razor tech support that told me that the problem was the electrical kit and I would need a new one for $50. Two weeks later the kit came in and I replaced it. Still didn't work. I called tech support again and they said it was the charger for $40 that needed to be replaced but it was back orderd for 4-6 weeks. Still not working but have many useless parts!
1,Horrible Experience!!!!!!!!!!,"I too bought this bike for my son on his birthday. It came the first time with the bike half way out of the box, cardboard missing from the box and numerous parts missing including the front axle and tire!!! Amazon said they would send me a new one no problem. Two days later I received the same item in the same box as before. Amazon said they would send it one more time! Well, after three weeks have gone by and I finally recieved the bike (AGAIN DAMAGED TO THE POINT THAT THINGS HAD FALLEN OUT OF THE BOX ON THE UPS TRUCK) I got a refund but my son still did not have a bike a month after his birthday!!! What a disaster!!!!!!!!!"
2,Short warranty,"We purchased a MX500 Razor Dirt Electric Motro bile from Toysr' Us in July, 2007 for our grandson to use when he visited. The bike ran very well the 4-5 times he came over to ride. This past weekend, Feb 15-17, we got the bike out after charging overnight and it did not run. Called Razor and they said it was likely the electric control module? Warranty is only for 90 days! Way too short! Module wil cost $24.99 plus shipping. Very dissappointed!"
3,Great when it runs,"I rated this a 3 stars because when it is running it is a 5 star product, when it is broken which is half the time or more then it is 0 stars. Kids absolutely love this thing when it is running..however we are now going on to our third replacement rear wheel assembly due to the hub failing (very common problem apparently as they are almost always out of stock). Basically each wheel last a couple of months and then you have to wait a few months to get a replacement. My kids do not bash the bike, basically drive it up and down the street and around a flat lawn. Very disappointing and expensive at $35 a wheel. Clearly a design fault and you get no help from customer service. If they could get this fixed then this would be a five star review"
2,Have two weekd and broke,Purchased this product for my sons 11th birthday and two weeks after the chain tensionser broker. Received replacement part and screw is stripped so we can not even fix it. This is suppose to be a dirt bike and the videos show kids doing all kinds or things with it. I suggest if you purchase to just have them ride up and down the street and make sure there are no bumps.
2,Razor MX500 experience,The product was shipped without a front axle so could not be used until Razor sent a new one. Throttle and controller broke down after 2 weeks. Rear wheel has a clutch that broke down now it in the shop waiting for a new wheel from Razor. A friend also just bought one and the rear wheel clutch also broke after 3 weeks. The bikes are fun for the kids when they are working but don't seem to hold up and getting warrenty parts seems to take too long.
4,Fun but back wheel problem,My kids got two of these for Christmas. One of them broke after just five minutes of riding. The back wheel problem that everyone keeps talking about is true! My brother was here so he took the wheel off and rigged it up so it's working for now. I would send it back in for another one but the problem is so common I'm scared I would just get another one that did the same thing. The other bike (so far) is working great. They do have to be kept in the house if it gets below freezing! The kids love them so much. The only time I can get the kids off is when the batteries die.
4,Dirt Rocket rocks - when it's charged,Our 10 year old really likes the MX500 and it performs great for his size. Everything was easy to assemble and no parts were missing from the box. The only complaint I have is the 40 minute run time compared to the 8 hours needed to charge it up. It will be fine for after school playing but can be frustrating if you want to ride it for a whole day.
3,To little action in the gym,"A buch of pretty girls who aren't allowed to do a proper training session. Most of the time they are outside of the gym, and i think that is a shame. If they had more action in the gym instead of letting the girls pose on other locations, this would have made a really god video."
5,Minding The Monsters,This another funny comedy special from Jeff Dunham. It is as funny as the other specials. I chose the rating because the first time I watched this special I couldn't stop laughing. I like all the specials. I would recommend this to any comedy fans.
2,A little cocky......,"Think fame has gone to his head....... Was not anywhere as good as past dvd's! Language was a little over done and I'm no prude. Do u really need the F bomb that many times?? Gay jokes get old......... NEED something new, fresh........ I so love Walter but wish there could be some new material. Red box worthy....."
5,Minding the monsters cool album,I really enjoyed this album Jeff Dunham has dune it again' if you bought his previous albums this is one that's a hit
4,funny,Very funny any Dunham fan needs this DVD in their collection. Not as good as one and two but still great.
1,very disappointed,I love Jeff Dunham but this DVD was lame and really not funny at all. Very disappointed and will read other reviews before purchasing another DVD.
4,not as funy as the previous ones.....but ok!!!!,This dvd is ok.....not as funy as the previous ones....but my favorite was Ahmed.....the second was peanut and jose jalapeño......
4,Jeff always provides a fun time,"Was not as impressed with this show as I was with his first two. Have purchased a disk of each of his shows and I'm always amazed at his talent & genius. Not as impressed with the joke material this time. Not as sharp/edgy as his earlier material, but the sets he created for this show are mind blowing. Have always enjoyed the bonus features he includes on these disks & am always stunned at his creative & artistic talent in creating both his puppets & the set backgrounds he uses. If your a Jeff Dunham fanatic like myself, I was add this to my collection. But again in my book, his first two dvds are his best work."
4,ink cardridge hungry?,"i have this printer for 6 months now without problem, though it already costed me a number of ink cardridges. i calculated it only makes about 50 print-outs per inkcardridge and i do not understand why it does so. website says it should print about 250- 450 for thr 9m, or 10ml ink cardridge.and i use it in fastdraft format which should save ink, not waste it. HP tech support suggested the ink cardridge was faulty, but how many faulty ink cardridges?i' m still trying to figure out what is wrong with it, or what i do wrong to make it waste the ink. with the cardridges i bought up to now, i could buy another cheaper printer and be also more economical."
1,Don't bother,"I recommend that you pass on this printer. I tried to install the software and kept getting the following error: Setup has encountered a severe error and will exit. I went to the HP support site and followed the instructions there for this error and still got the error. I sent a message to tech support and didn't get an answer. I tried the online support but kept getting disconnected.When I would reboot after trying to install, Windows kept doing a disk check.Save your money or buy the Canon BJC-55."
1,I have never received the cream lost in the post,"I've been waiting for 3 weeks for the cream to arrive and still waiting so I can't comment on this product. I hope I get a refund. I was really looking forward to try it on as I suffer from melasma. It started as a small hyperpigmentacion but now it is extended on all over my face. I used to be very pale, but now I look brow."
2,Messy,"I agree with heindenkind. This was a very messy book. All of the characters change their minds about who they want from chapter to chapter. First Lauren wants Alistair, then she wants Oliver, then she wants Alistair again. Alistair can't decide between Barbara and Lauren. Oliver can't decide between Barbara and Lauren. Barbara can't decide - anyway, you get the picture...Halfway through the book, I was shouting, ""Would you make up your minds?!""Unfortunately, by the end of the book, I was thinking, ""Who cares!"""
3,Chet Baker's last pleasant surprise,"Chet Baker's last years were, sadly, littered with mediocre or negligent performances. He frequently sounded as if he was intoxicated and sang so off-key that it was like fingernails on a blackboard.So this CD, one of his last, comes as a very pleasant surprise. Chet sounds straight, plays well, ballads and bebop, plays tight arrangements and actually sings on-key most of the time.If you had written off Chet Baker's last decade this one will surprise you.This CD set would have attracted a lot more attention if each CD had been released separately, the high price of this late set made me wary. But not to worry, both are well worth the listen.by MY rating system this CD gets 4 1/2 stars for a performance better than most of Chet's work. END"
5,Love Suzanne but AM tape has a tracking problem,"I too purchased this set from a vendor on Amazon. I love this tape set and Suzanne Deason. Suzanne is an excellent instructor, with a calming voice. Her instructions on each pose is so complete you don't have to look at the tape unless you want to. Which makes it easier to do the poses that have your head turned away from the screen. However, as was stated by another reviewer that purchased this set the AM tape has a tracking problem. I noticed it to late to return it or get another one. I was about to purchase another set from Amazon because of this problem. I am thankful I read the reviews first. I will purchase this AM tape again because I enjoy working with Suzanne. Maybe if I purchase it separately it will work properly."
3,does the job,these body bands are effective. the 3 levels of resistence give variety + are good for building muscle resistance. the only concern i have is the 'rubber' smell.. it lingers on my hands after use. i'm uncertain if the odor will diminish after longer use since i haven't had them too long.
3,So-So,This is my first Helen Brooks novel - for some reason I just couldn't get into the storyline - the heroine (Tamar) seems to have a chip on her shoulder throughout most of the book trying to revenge a wrong done by the hero (Jed) to her cousin - made all the worse since she herself was a survivor of physical assault - and catagorized most men (with certain characteristics)into that mould. She was attracted to him but frightened if he came too close.I did not finish the book because it simply didn't hold my interest. I'm rating it a so-so read because I really hate giving negative reviews. This authors other books could be perfectly wonderful =)
2,Poorly Constructed,"I bought this product only a week ago. I was impressed with it's high quality recording capabilities, but not its craftsmanship. I had the Edirol R-09 in a protective case and dropped it barely 2 feet from the ground. As I examined the product, the side had completely busted open. The ""on"" button was moved and the rubber had completely separated. As I tried to repair it, more and more plastic pieces started coming off. I was so disappointed how poorly this product was constructed. If you choose to buy this product buy a heavy duty case immediately or just beware that it's not durable."
3,"Good, but I expected it to be a little bit better.","When I first saw Calvin's video ""Keep on Pushin'"", I fell in love with his voice. (And he sure does look good too). I also heard him on the Rapheal Saadiq album which I also purchased (it's really good), and when I heard him on the track ""Excuse Me"", I knew I had to get his album.Vocally, he does very well on this album, and I think that his production skills are cool too. He has tons of potential as an artist, and I know that one day he's going to be a household name. So, eventhough this album wasn't spectacular, it wasn't a waste of money, and he has some good tracks. You will enjoy his vocals.Calvin, I look forward to hearing more from you in the future. I know that you will only get better.Let's keep supporting all of the ""soul"" artists out there."
4,Do what you have to do ...,"What does it take these days to get REAL talent noticed? How is it artists like Calvin Richardson, David Hollister, Raheem DeVaughn and Donell Jones take backseats to flavorless, colorless, pre-packaged robots that dominate MTV/BET rotations and airwaves?If you're tired of the aformentioned regurgitated mess that is most of PROMOTED contemporary R&B;, give CR's ""2:35PM"" a good listen.I copped this CD in summer '04 after seeing CR's video for ""Not Like This"" latenight on BET ... (incidentally, I never saw that video again).CR's got that old school soul and sings with a deeper, more sincere vocal approach that more than compensates for the fact he's not gonna blow you away like Joe, Brian McKnight or Maxwell.Personal favorite tracks are ""I'm Worthy,"" ""Keep on Pushin'"", ""More Than A Woman"" and ""Not Like This.""Highly recommended album for spending quality time with'cha girl or just for chilling after a long, hard and tiresome day."
3,middle book curse?,"the character development, the relationships and the storytelling style are as in the first book. the story itself takes a turn for the worse in this second installment. I wished it wasn't all downhill and negative. Some of the occurrences and turns of evens are also not very believable. Still a recommended read, but not as good as it could have been"
2,An assassin should actually kill people.,"Nothing ever happened in this book. It was full of heartache and sadness for a little boy and even though he as truly an assassin's apprintice, he never killed anyone and doesn't seem to have the prospects to do so.This is chic lit in a fantasy wrapping."
2,Heroes in Chains,If you like your heroes constantly captured by his enemies this is the series for you. Its unbelieveable how often he is captured and clapped in chains. Where is the actual hero in this story? There is more traveling in this book than any other book I've read. It would be nice if the Protaganist wins just once.
3,Poor ole Fitz gets ass kicked again.....,"For a ""Royal Assassin"", Fitz sure manages to get himself into some fixes. But then, not even death itself can knock him down for long, so the boy/man(?) can continue on his un-merry way right into the final book of the trilogy! Of course I will finish the final book, but wish I'd known what a stupid dolt Fitz is before I purchased the Tawny Man trilogy! (I purchased it based on reading Hobb's Liveship Traders trilogy.) Ok Fitz, let's get on and get this over with......"
2,Turn back now,"Book 1 of Farseer was full, complete, and plot driven. With each book beyond (and I've read all the Fitz books through the second series) there's more feminized men, irritating plot twists, pages beyond count of sopratic whining, and anticlimactic endings than anyone need bother with. The world is creative and the characters have some complexity but Fitz and his snivelling for pages and pages about old pieces of story are murderous. I found myself skimming frequently and honestly if I hadn't bought so many at once I'd have stopped at this book midway through. Hobb has talent but needs editing and some direction to keep her plot moving. Personally I hate protagonists that are stupid and/or whiners and Fitz becomes both. Enjoy the warm fuzzy from her first book and imagine it stands alone. Nothing more to see here... move along."
2,Eh.,"Not really much words for this book. It was ok I guess, a bit slow at times, didn't really like the characters, wasn't all that interested in the story. That's just me though. A disappointing sequel to a promising book... oh well."
4,Brillaint declaration of high fantasy,"""Royal Assassin"" is a worthy sequel to its predacessor ""Assassin's Apprentice"". This is where our charming young hero Fitz really comes into his own in his strange little world where he is caught between the royal family with whom he can never quite truly bond and his duty as the court assassin.The fantasy and plot continue to strengthen in this amazing novel, and open us up to an entirely new world outside the palace walls where Fitz grows into more than he ever dreamed possible. That is my testament to Hobb's talent at character development.The characters are wonderful, and the entire book vibrates with intense mystery and passionate love.I don't read a heck of a lot of fantasy, but this is certainly worth reading. Hobb is a wonderful writer with a marvelous sense of prose and a feeling for high fantasy."
5,Great read,Id have to agree with evertone who gave this book 5 stars it was amazing and I really enjoyed this book. As soon as I finished this book I had to go and read the next one.
5,"Again, another super book from Robin Hobbs","I know that Kindle/amazon and [...] both have the first book in this series for free. Please start in the beginning. get the free book and you'll love this series.I tend to read books that are atleast 3 or more in a series. There is;The Farseer's TrilogyThe live ship tradersand the tawny man trilogythese are in succession, and are wonderful reads.I choose authors that have many in a series, as i read very quickly, about 650 pages per book and i tend to read 1 book per week. If you are a fast reader, or just love to get caught up in a series that will hold you for a while. Robin Hobbs's books are the ones for you."
2,Sorry!,"I could not finish reading this book, just not my cup of tea. It was hard to settle down in. I placed it aside, can't say that I will ever pick it up again. I wish that the book was as strong as its cover but it was not."
3,A 70-minute acid trip.,"I've never taken drugs, but I enjoy watching movies that I feel are like the equivalent of tripping on acid or some other such thing. Even though this movie bored me to tears, I was still fascinated by the bizarre sense of creativity that went into it. Movies are supposed to entertain but movies are also art, a canvas for the filmmakers to do with as they please. This movie is art. An Andy Warholesque art nightmare. Frankensteins Bloody Nightmare.I feel that the filmmaker was attempting to make ERASERHEAD but wound up making THE JAR instead. That's okay. I enjoyed THE JAR."
3,thyme ground cover mower,"This lawn mower was as pictured in the ad. It came fast, has a great price tag, is the right size and was put together easily. I was disappointed that when I wheeled it to the grass on cement, it couldn't be pushed in front of you. It had to be turned around and pulled after you. I have thyme ground cover rather than grass. It had gotten rather lush and I wanted a mower that would cut off the blossoms (since blossoms attract bees). I found that it cut the thyme quite well if it was given some short up and back passes, it did a credible job of cutting even though it was not designed for ground cover. What I found was distressing was it had a tendency to flip. I borrowed a push reel sears model before buying this and found that their model cut better and rolled easily to the site of cutting but was harder to push while mowing. I have only used this mower once as the new dog we got at the time of the order killed most of the thyme with her urine."
5,Bigg Mouth,This is one of the best Metal records I have heard in very long time!!! This CD is a must have for your CD collection
4,Makes you feel the complexity of protocol design,"It's clear that this book is a little bit outdated compared to Holzmann's recent book on the SPIN model checker. However, i feel that the SPIN book does not explain how difficult it is to design even very simple protocols. In this one, Holzmann provides examples of protocols that look really simple while proving their correctness is utterly difficult. The examples are of particular interest for people working in networking.The interest of this book is mainly historical, since it treats protocol standardization and the design problems in early computer protocols. The latter half of the book presents the Promela language and the associated SPIN model checker, both of which are far better presented in the recent book ""The SPIN model checker"" by the same author (hence only the four stars since half of the book is now outdated)."
5,Excellent but Advanced,"I thought this dvd was excellent. I found that after I started doing the workout that I was more relaxed throughout the day. It was hard to do the first time because my body is definitely not as flexible as Ana's but I did find that my body was much more relaxed. In fact, it is kind of addicting so when others drink coffee to wake up, I now find myself doing Pilates. No DVD will be perfect but Ana's is definitely one of the best."
2,Advanced moves / lesser ab workout,"I'm a big fan of Gaiam fitness videos, mainly yoga. Although I got a good sweat during this 25 minute workout, I found the moves to be advanced and difficult from a coordination standpoint... but not necessrily hard on my abs, specifically. The next day my back and sides felt more sore than my abs. The Stott programs, even advanced, I could do... and felt more burn in my abs."
5,The V.Flash game system is the BEST!!!!,I gave my 4 year old son the V.Flash game system as a Christmas present. He wants to play it every waking moment. He is learning so much from the Jumping Bean Island game. He absolutely loves it!!!
1,junk,"Bought this for my 5 year old sons birthday. He loved it, played with it for about a week then it just stopped working. Can't figure out why. Don't waste your money."
1,worst hot wheels ever,i got this toy 4 x-mas about a year ago and guees what after a day of play it literly blew upone of the cars caght fire!im sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo disoponted after a year dont get any cars like this they never work!
2,RETURNED IMMEDIATELY,I thought this was a great toy for my two grandchildren who are 2-1/2 years old when they visit me. What a big disappointment. The balls never return to me they get stuck near the opening. When you throw them at the openings with the flap they never go through because the balls are to light and the flap stays in place. My granddchildren enjoyed climbing into it and just playing with the balls. I folded it up and returned it.
3,Unstable,I will give 3 stars to this product. Kids can have more fun with this if it stays up. It keeps falling.
5,A great read,"I picked up this book while out of state and finished most of it on a four-hour flight. The storyline was riveting, the characters concise and the dialogue believable. It seemed to me that some of the issues in the book were brushed over somewhat, but not every book delves into the deep issues of humanity. The ending was rather ""happily ever after"" but don't we all like to read a book that ends that way every now and then? Over all, a great read."
2,Uplifting,"This book is an assuring and comforting reminder to those that may be lost, and in inspiration, a light for those who are uncertain. Either way, I believe any reader will find comfort in this read, maybe even a little soul searching."
4,Realistic religion...,"Nichols does a great job of creating characters with realistic lives and views on religion. It's refreshing to read a Christian romance novel that has imperfect characters. Real life is imperfect and religion is a daily quest. Nichols draws you into the lives of her characters and lets you become a part of their world.In this story, Mary is running from the sins of her past and Alasdair is holding onto his. These two are brought together because of one little girl... Putting her foot in the door by being their nanny, Mary is drawn into the MacPherson family. Will Mary be able to help this family when she can't seem to help herself? Is their going to be any help for her once her past catches up to her?This is a great read."
1,disturbing and agitating,"I tried very hard to give these three albums a fair listen and all I can say is, see a doctor before listening to this one and be ready to dial 911 in case you pass out in sheer shock. On the other hand if you like listening to hours of continuous havoc than this is the album for you."
1,"People, People, People!!!!!!","This 3-CD cacophonous collection makes me want to wring the neck of anyone who complained about some of Jaco Pastorius's bewildering musical forays onstage. Jaco, at least, had clearly definable medical and mental problems that steered him in the directions he occasionally pursued. Folks, this is not an exciting new form of musical expression designed to enlighten us about the uncharted waters of musical directions yet to be explored and appreciated. Nor is it the catharsis of a tortured soul with the inability to control inner demons. It is ego gone wild as Mr. Metheny assumes his fan base will purchase and find fascination with anything he elects to offer in recorded form. This is not music? to slap on the headphones and soak in. It is neither appropriate in the background of a social occasion. But, for trashing a hotel room or fighting with your wife, this is the perfect soundtrack!"
1,AWFUL WITH 5 STARS OF AWFUL! (If I could),"I bought this a few years back and came back to listen again in hope I would understand it. Nope. Today I came to amazon hoping it would be worth a fortune. Nope. So, PM please warn buyers if its an experimental CD. I have almost everything he has on CD but this one, it is the worst. Occasionally a crazy song, but see, A SONG is on other album. On this one not even one."
3,Pretty good pastiche,"One of the better pastiches out there, with an inventive plot involving Holmes, Watson, Moriarty, time travel, atomic explosions, life on Mars, and more. There are a number of slow spots and Dvorkin's style is pedestrian -- and not a convincing replica of the voice of Doyle's Watson -- but all in all an enjoyable read."
4,Bjork - It's Oh So Quiet,"This CD is excellent. It makes you think ""big band"" meets Middle America! It just makes you want to get up and dance. Bjork's quirky, nontraditional voice adds a new feel to this song as well. A great overall single to make to get up and boogie!"
4,Pioneer Avic S-1 GPS is great,the purchase was prompt and i'd purchase from this seller again. the GPS works very good. i also purchased from someone else an external range antenna which gives me a stronger signal from a 50 mile radius.
2,Missing a lot of useful features,I bought this item based on the Pioneer name but I think they should stick to just audio. The interface between the device and the PC is just a windows CE plug in that is incapable of doing anything useful with (like planning a trip.) I recommend not buying this product if you want the convenience of planning a trip on your pc. You have no idea what route you are going to take until you are on it. Their avoidance of blocked roads a couple of miles ahead doesn't change your course at all. It is good if you only care about getting from point A to point B without any idea of what is between and don't care about planning the route on your pc.
1,Bad software,The software with the Pioneer will get you lost faster than a blind navigator. Worst one on the market.
4,Chicken soup for the single parent's soul,This is a great book. It help to know that there are other people like me that have the same struggles and get through them.
2,A whole lot missing,TO begin it does not run in Windows 8. So i cleaned up an PC to install it on. After installation I found that most of what I wanted was not on the CD it then directed you to spend an additional $49.95 to get other reference books. The word Ultra is very misleading.
1,He forgot the insert statement.,"This book is usefull only for extracting data. There is nothing about inserting updating or deleating. How can it be called ""Definitive""?"
5,For introverts and psychedelic causualties alike,"This CD probabaly gives the best presentation of Spooky's esoteric hypothesis about his work. His trademark production moves like aminotic fluid and the tracks exhibit the streets of New York as a telephone pole erupting with flyers, each providing a destination for his after-hours stroll."
5,Amazing buy - great for almost anything,"We use it for bbqs, tailgating, camping, and anything you can think of.The instant-start ignition is awesome and it has always worked great. You can usually buy 2 cans of coleman/generic brand gas at Walmart for about $5 so it's definitely not costly to run it."
5,bjork cd single,"Roughly prior to the mid-to early 2000s, it was easy to find CD singles at your local record / CD store like Best Buy, Musicland a.k.a. Sam Goody, a.k.a. FYI and (most famously) Circuit City, the latter of which even allowed one to preview his or her purchase by actually listening to a already-loaded copy of it there in the store. With the ever-increasing allure of the Internet's MP3 applications for music downloading and the repeated ""doom"" forecast of CDs, this is no longer the case---for the most part.Yet, every so often one can still find a (decently affordable) CD single of a favorite song on Amazon. Having first heard ""Army Of Me"" by Bjork on the Sucker Punch soundtrack, I was happily surprised to find it available at a good price. I've always been a collector of various remixes of my favorite songs, and though this CD doesn't have the same exact bass-heavy version from the movie, the three versions it does have are interesting."
5,beautiful and romantic,"This is a beautiful, romantic set of songs. It's very minimal -- just Bey's baritone voice crooning over some delicate piano chords. It's a CD to play when you're having an intimate evening with someone important to you."
2,The diet might be great but its description is too skinny,"While the science of the diet might be sound and the diet itself might work wonderfully, the book's description of the mechanics of the diet are way too vague. For example, in its discussion of Phase 1 of the diet, it states that one should eat only those carbohydrates that exhibit a low glycemic index value, but fails to indicate what values should be considered ""low."" Because of the lack of concrete detail, it seems as though the diet would be a bit too difficult to truly follow unless one adheres closely to the extensive meal plans provided."
4,lost 10 lbs in 8 weeks,Hi I lost 10 lbs in 8 weeks.. However I'm switching to body for life.. it has more foods available.. im tired of eating the same thing all the time
5,"Wow, I am amazed.",Diets have never worked for me until I tried this diet. It is a very good diet and the food is incredible. I love it! I am never hungry and the diet is giving me plenty of energy. the only drawback is that it is expensive to eat healthy. 5 stars!!!
2,Diets dont work!,"People don't seem to get it. Diets don't work.Eat less and exercise and you won't be fat.But people want to ear Happy Meals sitting down.It won't work.Of course, people will always buy diet book and never exercise."
3,"Solid advice for healthy weight loss, yet incomplete...","This book illustrates that dieting can occur from within a holistic context. Furthermore, in this book, Agatston has put forward a reasonable dietary curriculum for achieving positive results in very little time. This is a must-read for any disgruntled former adherents of the Atkins diet. However, at the same time, there is not sufficient elucidation of the essential spiritual, mental, and emotional aspects which are inherent in such a disciplined program. This reviewer gives Agatston three stars for his promising, yet ultimately incomplete ""South Beach Diet""."
4,Good food costs more than junk: so what?,"I agree with the reviewers who have noted that following the SBD plan can seem both expensive and time consuming. But that's nothing unique to the South Beach plan: following good health habits in America today takes time and money no matter how you do it. We live in an economy where junk food is everywhere and dirt cheap. Lean protein, whole grains and good quality produce are way more expensive than Twinkies, Hungry Jack Cheesy Potatoes and Whoppers. Preparing actual meals takes way more time than drive-through or throwing something in the microwave. If you want to be slim and strong in our society, you're fighting an uphill battle and that's going to cost you. Think of yourself as a counter-culture warrior, prepared to invest in the best weaponry. And maybe stop buying those fancy latte drinks with the 5000% markup so you can afford fresh salad greens."
5,Highly Recommend!!!,"I went on this diet last summer with a friend who wanted to lose weight. I wasn't interested in loosing weight but she talked me into reading the first few chapters. I started the diet to lower my blood sugar, which I did by an average of 50 points. But in the process I lost 31 lbs. over the next few months. I only stayed on the diet for the 1st Phase (2 weeks) after which I added back fruits, whole grain breads, oatmeal, rice and potatoes. I never did weigh myself during this time, but when I returned to Texas and got on my daughter's Wii Fit it told me I had lost 31 lbs. I bought the book myself this time to help my daughter lose weight. After the 1st week sbe lost over 5 lbs. and I lost 10 lbs. We are scheduled to weight in again in 2 days. I am looking forward to seeing great results again."
5,South Beach Diet Cookbook,"This book has literally turned my life around. I never realized there were so many ""good and healthy"" choices. I have tried many things I never though of and loved them. The best part is I have lost 28 pounds in the process."
1,Vegetarians beware,"Leafing through every page of this famous book, I found it utterly useless for anyone who's vegetarian. Four of the meatless recipes were useful, though not particularly appealing in terms of taste."
5,It works !!,"My wife and I went on this diet 13 weeks before we went on vacation, she lost 30 pounds and went from size 12 jeans to size 8. I lost 35 pounds and went from size 40 pants to size 34. I have never found a diet the would work and let me eat enough that I didn't always feel ether hungery or starving. Like I have stated this is one diet that really works."
1,Best Diet for Life. Lowered my Blood Pressure 30 Points in 4 weeks,"Very Easy to Read, Easy to follow and only 90 simple to read and understand diet. The other 200 pages is daily diet day by day, and menu and recipes. (EASY Recipes), I'm a Guy I dont have time for complication. If you read the first 40 pages You will be convinced and understand from a practicing Cardiologist why people are Fat and why Diabetes is taking over lives. Get this book TODAY and you will live a longer healthier life."
3,"Certainly scientific, but..not sure about its result ..","I would definitely recommend this book to somebody who is over size 8 and have quite alot to lose. But for me, size 8 trying to lose down to 4, this did not have that much of a dramatic result, even in phase 1. and I swear, i followed it pretty well.I lost about 5lbs in the whole course of phase 1, and i am assuming it is because i didn't cut down enough on my ricotta cheese which Dr.Agaston does approve of enjoying ...Well, overall, i certainly do agree with the whole idea of insuline resistance diet, but i'm not sure if this is the life long way to lose weight unless one is seriously overweight already."
2,Expected Much More,"Not worth the price for the little bit of information you get from this book. I expected much more indepth information and guidance on nutrition, reading labels, etc., and I didn't feel as though I got it. I felt like I got more of a cookbook and a lot of historical commentary I felt was unnecessary. The philosophy of the diet seems good, but I would save my money and instead get the information from friends or online."
2,hi protein gives you kidney disease,"After 10 days on the South Beach diet I had lost 7 pounds, which was great. However, on day 10 I was also in the hospital with kidney stones so big they got stuck on the way out--a direct result of the diet according to the urologist AND the ER physician AND my family doctor. (Because excess protein makes your body excrete calcium, which makes the stones.) After 2 weeks of excruciating pain and $16,000 in medical bills, I have realized that this diet is really NOT such a good idea. I give the book 1 star for dispensing dangerous medical advice and 1 because the recipes are actually good, and easy to prepare."
2,Old news.,"For anyone who has ever read about The Zone diet, the information in this book is old news and incomplete."
2,There's a much better book,"Take a look at the very new book, Beyond Atkins, by Dr. Douglas Markham. Better, more concise, covers everything including a real exercise plan. I just started on his plan and love it. And Dr. Markham has been doing this work for his entire career, not as a recent money maker. You can see my review there."
3,Wordy,"Buy the newer book South Beach Supercharged, it is updated and easier to follow.There are a few to many testimonials and not enough meat to serving sizes, exact diet. But, that is the same in both books"
5,It Works!!!,"This book is great. Not only is the diet easy to follow, the book explains everything to you. I always went on diets not really knowing why I needed to eat certain foods. This book explains the ""backround"" to the diet so you don't look at it as a diet but a lifestyle change. I was about 15 pounds overweight and have lost all 15 pounds on this diet. Phase 1 (2 weeks) was really not that hard. It is tuff to eliminate carbs but if you concentrate on the foods you can have (protein, certain vegetables, etc.) it really does not feel like you are on a diet... I would recommend this diet to anyone."
3,Good diet (I think)/ Bad Book,"After only 4 days on the diet, I cannot comment on the diet itself but I am horrified by the outright mistakes and inconsistencies in the book. This just shouldn't happen in a bestseller like this. For example, Dr.Agatston recommends in Phase 2 to add fruit to your diet but advises not to have it with breakfast (p.42). Yet in the meal plan for Phase 2, nearly every breakfast includes fruit. A meal plan breakfast item in Phase 1 is said to have a recipe on p. 131 but it is the wrong recipe. Additionally, it is suggested in the text to eat nuts as a snack in Phase 1 but they are never shown in the meal plan as an option. The doctor writes in the text to eat only low-fat cheese in Phase 1 but in the meal planner for 2 days in a row he lists fresh mozzarella cheese balls as a snack.I could go on...but did anyone proofread this book ????"
3,"Good recipes, but..","This book has some good ideas for eating low on the glycemic scale, and the food recipes are very tasty. I did have a low energy problem the first week on the meal plans provided in the book. It's not recommended to start with Phase II of the plan, but I think it would be a healthier beginning, albeit slower in weight-loss."
3,Good diet but hard to follow,"This was a good book, but it was hard to follow and lose weight because I was hungry most of the time. Also, the snack foods, lowfat cheese and nuts didn't agree with me, so that left me with fewer choices. But I do know people who have lost weight on the diet, but when they go off, they gain the weight back."
2,Atkins copied,"This is nothing more than the Atkins Diet revisited. Diet books are big money makers and the Atkins Diet is the only diet that really works over time - so you get a number of re-written Atkins Diets with ""new"" names. This is just another one. The best book is still Atkins' own, which explains the inner workings of the diet. This uses a jazzy ""South Beach"" version as a promotion gimmick.I do recommend the book, however, since there are so many of us who need a diet that works and while it is a copy-cat, it still works."
1,Just Like Any Other Diet Book,"Can you say, ""FAD""? Just like any other diet book out there, you read the blah, blah, blah, look at the restrictions, glance at the recipies, and then put it on the bookshelf. There is actually more and better information on The South Beach Diet web site."
2,nothing new,"This book has some helpful recipes, but it is basically the same low carb diet that can be found in less complicated form elsewhere. It's not all that different than Dr. Atkins work, really, particularly if you read his newest book, Atkins for Life."
3,My Review is as much for the diet as the book-both average,"I planned to quit my Atkins diet after getting down to my goal weight and go on South Beach. When I was ready for S.B., I got this book and decided to skip it. The problem with this book is that it's far too lenient and is ambiguous about what we can and cannot eat. He says Atkins is too strict and yet he gives us way too many carbs without strict guideance except in the early 2 weeks. A magazine on low carbs mocked South Beach (again, this was a pro-low carb magazine) saying people went on S.B. thinking it was the healthy Atkins when in reality it's the same diet only fewer rules. It's the fewer rules that makes S.B. a diet that you do not - and cannot - know for sure if you're ever following this book's advice except in the VERY first 2 weeks. If you've been on Atkins, stay on it or you'll only be confused here."
1,"A bit of a fad, with modest results...","No diet replaces healthy exercise. I lost 50 pounds last year by minimizing/eliminating sugars, running 3-4 miles per day 5 days per week and little else. This diet will help you lose weight; but to keep it off, I suggest exercise & moderation. Nothing more."
1,"Shedding pounds the easy way, YEAH RIGHT!!!!","Look people, To lose weight is simple. The only effective and inexpensive way to lose weight is to eat less and work out more. Diets are apart of our societies ""I want it NOW not later and heaven forbid it, if hard work is required!!"" mentality. I dont care if your obese or just plain overweight you can lose weight if you work out at least 4 days a week(at least 45 min of cardio), watch your fat intake and drink more water. Keep this up for 12 weeks and you will have lost more weight then you could have imagined. The one flaw with the above is that it requires will power and diets feed on your lack of will power to survive. good luck!"
1,Another diet book,"Here we go again, another doc telling us what to eat and not to eat. The recipes looked good and I might even give some a try. However, I will never give up my carbohydrates! They get me moving, I feel happy and although too much is bad I manage to balance it all out with a little exercise. thanks, but no thanks, in the bin with Atkins it goes."
4,Nice book.,This book is as advertised! It is a nice hard bound book. Now it would be good if I could or would actually use it!
2,Better information online,"I liked what I'd heard about this ""diet"" and bought the book to get the details so that I could do the two week phase 1 correctly. But, I ended up with so many questions that I needed to go online for help. The information at the free support sites was more than enough to follow the plan. (I didn't need the fee-based official site.) For example, the book lists food that is ""banned"" for phase 1, but then listed as an ingredient in some of the phase 1 recipies. Is it ok for me to use in my own recipies? Also, a large part of the book is the section with recipies, but these are from restaurants and are too much trouble for me to make when I just want to grab a snack.Bottom line -- good food plan, but the book isn't worth buying."
5,South Beach,Purchased this for myself - really great advice about dieting the right way. Was not able to follow the right way but still lost weight. Will use again to keep myself in check. Recipes are great.
5,A diet book that actually works... who knew??,"My cousin and I have been on this plan just over five months. She's lost 48 pounds and has dropped from a 16 to an 8. I've lost 91 pounds and have gone from a 32 to a 24. Obviously I have a long way to go, still, but for the first time in my life I have the tools to make it happen. The book is clear and an easy read. The recipes are helpful, though I never followed the meal plan. I have given away several copies of this book and many of my friends have bought their own. It works. It's the best money I've ever spent."
2,How long will it last?,"Losing 20 pounds in three weeks: how long will that last. I would like to see how many people keep this kind of weight off over the course of one year. There are millions of diet books sold each year in this country, enough for all the overweight folks to have lost huge amounts of weight by now. Why the need for another diet book? Because in the long term, diets don't work, especially diets in which one loses weight rapidly."
3,good recipes and flexable,"I think it is easy to follow. Since I only have 10 pounds to lose, I skipped phase one and stayed on two. I am slowly losing about 1-2 punds a week. Which is fine with me because I have only 10. I can only speak for those who have this to lose. I love veggies, I love protein now---I was a major carb overloader (breads!Pasta! etc) I find I eat less often, have far less cravings then ever in my life, and I feel great. My workouts with the weights are better then ever. I am feeling the protein is helping....not sure. I drink more water now. I can not complain. But, it meets my goals for slow weight loss, long term eating plan, more energy, less cravings for sugar, and not feeling ""fat""! Works for me---"
1,This is a rip-off of Atkins!,"I had decided to try a low carb diet this year and bought this due to all the 5 star reviews here. It is dissapointing to say the least. Basically Dr. Agatston has simply taken the principles of Dr. Robert Atkins and put together a book with not much substance in a fancy package (truly not worth the price). The 2nd and 3rd phases of the diet are high in carbs and are more like the Atkins maintenance phase. If you have a carb addiction, don't waste your money on this book. Pick up Dr. Atkins NEW Diet Revolution."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this as an extra TV in a spare room. The speaker system is not very good. Very distorted. I am very disappointed with this purchase. I have always liked Toshiba products, but this model is awful. I would not endorse."
4,Shiny spiky sonic horror,"I dunno. It's really hard to impress the uninformed with the power and energy of this band. This epitomises the fervour and feeling (sometimes I think naieve when put into the context of modern writing and recording - though not a bad thing) of the post punk era, NOT Britney Spears, thats for sure. Even though the Birthday Party's last releases (Mutiny in Heaven et al) and the following album (Junkyard) are, to me, better in their fullfilment as albums, Prayers On Fire is a baptism by fire - brave, gregarious and terrifying, but nonetheless thought provoking on where music can take you. King Ink is probably the most truculent song I'd heard when I first heard it - the band probably laughed their heads off after completing it! Drop your guard, and leave your preconceptions of what music is about at the cloakroom and listen."
2,Not for the oversized cranium...,"This is a very neat product and I seriously wish it worked for me, but I find myself constantly messing with it because it's just too damned small for me. Worn around the neck it strangles, and any way I put it on top of my head it immediately starts creeping off. I see they make a ""slim"" fit now for the ""pinhead"" types, how about one for us with the ""jumbo gourd"". Seriously, I'll pay extra!"
3,Buff Review,"perhaps it is just the style i purchased, i should have got a different one, its tight on my head, although i have allot of hair, i was looking to buy one to where like a beenie, i will keep it for camping trips and such, and where it to keep my hair down so i can where a ball cap,it should be 10 dollars not 20, they have so many styles it is worth it though"
5,Awesome,"I already owned a buff, but realized I used it so much that owning two would be advantageous. I LOVE the pattern of the new one and use it preferentially now. Buff headwear is so versatile...I use it mainly while working out to make a hair restraint device that is appropriate to the activity and the climate. I use mine so much that I really could use three, so am contemplating purchasing another. I have used it as a warm-weather cap, a headband, a hairnet, under a bicycle helmet...you name it, you can create a new way to use this simple tubular-shaped cloth. Def like the ideas given on the packaging. At first, you may think it seems expensive, but the functionality of the piece is definitely worth twenty bucks. If you are getting it for cheaper than that, then don't think twice about buying it. You are getting an incredible deal."
4,"Perfect counterpart to ""Post""","Bjork's ""Telegram"" is a revamped and remade version of 1995's ""Post,"" and it is a perfect counterpart. The remixes are all very good, and one new song ""My Spine"" is a standout track."
5,MF 135 Shop Manual,"This is an excellent Manual. Well worth the money. Of course, it is incomplete without the ""MF-135 Operator's Manual"". The two manuals are meant to compliment each other. If you have an MF-135...you need these two manuals."
4,Don't Overplay,"The graphics aren't great, the house is small but hey its okay. Though there is alot to do but it's repeated often. You have your own pets but its sometimes hard to pay attention to that pet. I didn't think it would be like a vet game, Sims could of done better."
3,Not too bad.,"If you know the Sims, you've got a baseline for what to expect here, Except that Pets and caring after them is the focus here."
5,"this is a scholarly book, it's good for CHARACTER STUDY","A PURITAN MIND is not the normal kind of book one would read about Puritan life in the 1600s, Colonial America, as it pulls more on quotes from religious Puritan documents. You have to already know the history of all the A, B and C-list people in Puritan history to appreciate this book.I'm a playwright who is focused on a story that crosses into the Puritans in their utopian society in Massachusetts."
5,Excellent book,Great book with impressive quality pictures and great information. Any Doom buff will love it.
2,Worked for 4 years then quit,It just won't start. I've did everything that you should do and it just died. Next time I will just buy a Honda.
5,Excellent CD Beautifully remastered.,"Bought this mainly for two trax but the whole CD is worth the price. My only quibble would be that I would like to have seen the track Outside Help also included, but I still rate this as Five stars. Delivery was very quick well inside the estimated time."
1,Awful!,"I'd never read Woody Allen before, and I just wanted to give it a shot. I ordered it online and for whatever reason I didn't look at any excerpts first. I really wish I would have, because it literally only took one page for me to know that I couldn't read it. I never got past that first page. If you've never read Allen, find some excerpts first - his style is unique and to me, very annoying."
3,trained a couple of cats with these; ordering another,"I have used this to train 2 cats, one got it in a couple of days, the other it took a couple of months and then he used the potty for 15 years. I'm buying another to train a friends 2 cats at once while I'm pet-sitting. It is just a piece of plastic, but I can't see how I'd make one myself, and it has done the trick - the whiz ring and LOTs of patience and encouragement and praise for your kitty."
1,wild animus,"i was given this book for free on the street as a promotion. i started the book with much interest and realized that it truely was one of the worst books i ever read. i left it at a coffee shop about half way through, i could not bear to read any more. do not waste your money!!"
1,Inspiring...,"After just reading this book I can say that this is the most inspiring piece of work....why??? 1. My 5 year old daughter, my dog or I can honestly can write something more creative and interesting. I will honestly keep this book as a reference point. ""If he could do it...so could I."" Thank you Rich Shapero you are also my inspiration... I might write something about turning into a barkeeper with no hands..."
2,Misses the Mark,"This book wants to be about man's search for God, or God's search for man. Shapero writes lyrically, with unrepentant paganism, of the natural world and of the god who permeates it, but he never reconciles the two faces of animus - the spirit which brings life, and deep-seated resentment and hostility.His protagonist is either the first Messiah of the New Millenium, or a brain-burned Berkely dropout whose self-centered journey toward shamanism ends up destroying not only himself but all those who love him and trust him and believe in him. I tend to lean toward the latter. Bob Dylan told us a long time ago - a saviour's a nuisance to live with at home.Sam becomes Ransom - and a ransom is something you pay, something you surrender, to redeem that which is precious to you. Sam becomes Ransom - a ransom, *the* ransom -- but what does he redeem? Shapero never manages to make that clear -- and that's the failure of the book."
1,Unreadable,"Truly unreadable, sprawling, rambling garbage. Once the first italicized paragraph hits, the reader is in for it. Like everyone else in America, I got this book for free on a street corner. What the author tries to do is admirable, but Wild Animus is just choked with god-awful metaphors and flowery prose poetry. If you can wade through them, maybe you'll find a story worth reading, but I'm not sure the chore was worth it."
1,RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!,"I listened to this book on CD while I was driving, as a result, I listened to the whole book. When I was done I have never been so angry to have read a book to the end! But having read many of the reviews, I pose the question, is the author a narcissist? He was clearly very full of himself and I think he needs medications. I would recommend avoiding this book, but I have to wonder if maybe his intent was to provoke us. That is the only justification I can make of this insane story."
1,I can't believe I read the whole thing!,"I can't believe I read the whole thing! The main character, Sam, is some sort of megalomaniac who is abusive to his co-dependent girlfriend, who for the life of me, I can't imagine why she continues to support the guy.I think this book does a disservice to the 60's--sure, naive in a lot of ways, but highly idealistic. Where are the ideas in this novel? And also does a disservice to the shamanistic cultures--these were serious spiritual journeys that eventually brought enlightenment back to the whole tribe. For that matter, Christ and Buddha shared what they learned. Sam is in it for his own glory--or destruction--and brings everyone around him down. This guy was crying for INTERVENTION. Didn't they do those back then? Didn't they do them in Alaska?"
1,I tried very hard....,"I tried very hard to finish this book, but in the end decided that some things just will not suit my sense of literature.Granted, I am not a fantasy person.....I at least hope that I was not supposed to buy into the story line as credible. 60's, acid trips, flat female character suffering from emotional outbursts, and strange guy with a strange goal---not my thing.If you decide to read this book, try to get it free from someone else."
1,Boring...,I couldn't stand this book... I read the first couple of chapters hoping it would get better. Just not my cup of tea.
2,"beautiful setting, cheap stones","This is clearly not a sapphire, but the picture makes it seem much bluer. The stone is violet, not dark blue. The ring itself is lovely, has very nice milgrain working all over, but the side stones are nicer than the center stone."
1,"Great, until they break.","Ive had three of these now, and I'm not going to bother returning the third one. I don't know if I am just having a giant streak of bad luck or what, but I have had the same problem on all three blenders. They work great, for about a month, and then they quit.When you try to power them on, the motor moves for maybe - 1/10th of a second, and then the blue light flashes... and thats it. Too bad, its a decent blender when it works."
2,Mayday! Mayday!,"Help! My love of Banks' Culture series forced me to read this book. Bad idea. Now I know more than I want to about Scottish hippies and their nightmares.Still, this is Iain Banks, and there are some good parts of the book. But I can't recommend it, even to Banks fans."
4,Critical Pedagogy: For Teachers and Parents,"Critical Pedagogy Notes from the Real Word is an interesting read. In this book Dr. Wink weaves stories from her many years in education with her thoughts on everyone from Socrates to Stephen Krashen, and everyone in between. If you are looking for a concise definition of critical pedagogy or an instructional manual on how to do it, you wont find that here. What you will find is the tools and inspiration to discover what critical pedagogy is for you.Although I'm not sure this is a text that many parents would find their way to I believe they should. While most of the reviews seem to be from educators the book is written is such a way that parents would find the examples and tools extremely useful in navigating their child's education."
4,Critical Pedagogy: Notes from the real world,"In this book (Critical Pedagogy:Notes from the real world), we explore and learn the road of one teachers experience and we are given applications for the `real world'. It is a book that is for anyone and everyone including but not limited to researchers, administrators and teachers. It teaches us issues, terms and philosophies in the educational environment. I think wink helps those of us who have trouble reading and learning theory-based books. She gives us many real world examples to help us better understand multicultural and critical pedagogy. This books help to be more amusing and easy to read rather then dry and boring. It is Winks real life experiences and attentive personality that makes learning about the educational systems issues more open and helpful. I recommend this book for past teachers, administrators, but more mainly for future teachers."
5,Great Book,"As a future teacher, I greatly enjoyed and benefited from reading Dr. Joan Wink's book, Critical Pedagogy: Notes from the Real World. Not only did this book help give me an understanding of what pedagogy is, which in simple terms is the interaction between teaching and learning, but it also made me critically think about what kind of teacher I hope to become. The three models of learning (transmission, generative, and transformative) are clearly discussed in this book, helping readers understand how each will affect the learning that takes place in classrooms.The information in this book was clear, relevant, thought provoking, and presented in a reader-friendly manner. Dr. Wink also did a fabulous job of sharing some of her personal experiences to better help convey her ideas, which made the book very entertaining to read. I found this book to be very enjoyable and much better than the average text book. I highly recommend it."
4,Critical Pedagogy,Critical Pedagogy: Notes from the Real World (3rd Edition)Easy read and a lot of information. Author seems to repeat the same basic idea over and over. A good basic start to critical pedagogy for newer teachers or college students.
1,Major Disappointment,"If this book were written by a first time author it wouldn't have been published. Sydney Sheldon has too much talent for his editors to allow something as juvenile as this book to go to press. It's a major disappointment. The plot is telegraphed a mile out, the story itself is shallow, and there is no effort to develop the characters. This could have been the outline of an idea, but not a finished novel."
1,stupid mistakes,"In standard form, the Police Chief (Wash, DC) is being pressured by politicians for action on a celebrity murder. His secretary tells him the Mayor is calling but he says he can't take the call because he is on the phone with the GOVERNOR. Of DC? Right! This is on page 46 and long before that the reader has discovered that logic and realistic basic information have NO place in this book. I read another 20 pages before tossing this one. A real dud."
2,Ugh.,"The Sky is Falling, the latest of Sidney Sheldon's books, is one of his worst. Sheldon found his formula for writing a best seller some books ago and...he's consistent. Sex, drama, wealth, power...and the shallowist of characters and most fantastic of motives. Then add some travel, an exotic place or two, and a heroine with enough money and a dearth of brainpower. Bingo! Another best seller.Don't fall for it. It's not a very good book."
3,Mediocre - not up to par,"Usually Sidney Sheldon books are real page turners. This book was not nearly as interesting as his previous books. I didn't like Jeff because his ex was more important to him than his fiance. The main character was unbelievable. The romance didn't work. It certainly wasn't boring, but not very exciting either."
1,Definitely not his best!!,Being a tried and true Sheldon fan I was terribly disappointed with this book. I am left wondering if he even wrote it. I thought the writing was very poor and the plot was very disjointed. Hopefully his next book will be better.
1,SHeldon is Losing It,"Sydney SHeldon is known as a GREAT storyteller and master plot twister. ""The Sky Is Falling was a big disappointment for those who expect more from this author. The plot was sooooo predictable and rather trivial to boot. Wait for the paperback if you must satisfy your curiousity."
1,Don't bother.,"The story line may have been interesting, but the writing is horrible. The descriptions and the analogies are eye-rolling. The abridgement was halting and didn't make sense in some parts as if a vital part to the story was lost. But these are not the worst parts of this audiobook, it was the narration that was grossly inept and flat. It could not have been worse. Instead of sounding like a thriller, it sounded like a person on valium reading a bedtime story to a four-year old. A long cry from the Sidney Sheldon that I remembered"
2,Ridiculous,A well known anchorwoman turns into an international sleuth. It goes from the sublime to the ridiculous in it's super hero main character. It also goes past the improbable. Wasted space in her fiance's relationship with his ex-wife. It's so unbelievable it's almost laughable. The good thing is it's a very quick book to read....and forget
1,Stupidly told fairy story,"Dana, the goody two shoes reporter is back in from ""Best Laid Plans."" She's a goody-goody who adopts a boy with one arm and ends up in a relationship you could see from chapter 1. Naturally she rises in the journalism field and naturally she wins at everything. From feeding orphans in Eastern Europe to battling Russian officials in an underground Russian village, goody-goody Dana wins every time as everybody knows she would. Boo to this book!"
1,Oversalted Broth,"Sheldon's latest serving comes up empty. His soupy tale is at best a broth, and way oversalted. It seems as if Mr. Sheldon kept trying to make his formula more interesting by adding more and more to it, but he left out the meat and potatoes. Don't waste 4 hours reading this if you are looking for anything substantial.The only reason I gave 1 star is because I was impressed with how he handled Rachel's relationship to Jeff.The lesson we should all learn from this book is heed the warning."
2,It's almost like a diary,"I joined my voice with those who said that Sheldon could have written it much better. I think the devlopment of the characters is not convincing at all. They seem clearly unreal. For example, the channel boss who always lets Dana take a leave. Dana's lover whose character is unbalnced. Only Kemal, the adopted orphan, is well developed and can give you a sense of emotions.The events are extreemly very fast. The first paragraph Dana is in the house; the second one Dana is in Moscow, France or Italy. It really looks like a diary. This makes the plot so predictable. It could have been better, but the pace of the story makes it so.Probably, Sheldon didn't want to make the novel longer. In my personal opinion, it was the big mistake which lead to the negative points I pointed out."
3,The Sky Is Falling Review,"If some of you haven't noticed, this book's characters comes from his other book ""The Best Laid Plans."" You don't need to read that book to know who the characters are, but it helps because it will give you more background information. Anyhow, I thought the plot was interesting, and no doubt a page-turner (especially since I finished it the same day I bought it) however I'm sorry to say that this book was not all that great compared to his other books. In my opinion, it seems like he's losing his touch. I can't exactly figure out what it is, but the book seems to be missing something.. and I guess I didn't get the ""fullfilment"" at the end that I usually get when reading his books. Anyhow, Sidney Sheldon is one of my favorite authors, so if this is the first book you've read from him, check out his other books, they're awesome! =)"
4,Gets the job done!,"I actually own the Velo 8 model, which has 3 features more than this one.With a very comfortable design, the Velo 5 cycle computer offers the rudimentary set of features that your average cyclist needs.Ease-of-use and reliability are its strong selling points; however, once installed on the handlebar, the unit housing might need a little strengthening.Overall, if you need a cycle computer and are a tight budget, the Velo 5 is the model for you as it gets the job done!"
3,should have been one CD at most,"I am a big fan of Sun Ra, so I was excited to see some previously unreleased work released. Unfortunately, this collection has many tunes that few Sun Ra fans would find intriging -- his pop tunes with various Chicago groups in the 50's. The last two-thirds of the 2nd CD is pretty good, though."
4,A new way to look at an old God,"Borg gave me insight into what I always knew that God wasn't just a benevolent dictator. The God of Grace is not just out there, but in our world among us, beside us, inside us, and around us at all times and in all places. I'm not sure I can buy into a lot his ideas on the Post-Easter Jesus, though. I enjoyed reading the book, but I think I was ready to read it. That is, I finally reached that point in my life that my faith journey demanded that I read it. I'm sure other people would have opposite reactions to the book. Therefore, I suspect that the book did just what the good professor expected it to do -- provide more questions that have no answers."
2,keep the enemy closer,"Typical fare from a postmodern theologian who fearlessly stamps out a version of God the is limited to that which is rationally provable or at least plausable. Physical resurection? Hocus pocus. Orthodox divinity? Clap trap.I always wonder how modern theologians, 2000 years after the event, claim to have found in the scriptures the ""real meaning"", which the great minds of the last 2000 years were too stupid to see. How can we possibly read more clearly than those who were from the same culture and period? Can we really look down the well of time without merely seeing our own faces reflected back - seeing what we wish to see.Marrying the spirit of the age, as this school does, is lonely in the long run."
4,Thoughtful Christianity,"I've enjoyed all of Borg's books. In this book, I felt the chapters dealing with reconciling the ""two"" Jesuses - pre- and post-Easter were helpful to me as a Christian. Readers who enjoyed this book might also enjoy the books, The Good Book by Peter Gomes and Narratives of a Vulnerable God by Charles Placher."
4,Alien movie book,"This is a nice book about the original Alien movie if you are primarily interested in seeing the conceptual artwork that was created before the film was shot. There are also many behind the scenes photos of the sets and of the Alien creature being built and worn by the actors in this complex costume. If you are really a fan of this film and want more in depth information on pre and postproduction details then seek out back issues of Cinefex and American cinematographer magazines. Also there are websites dedicated to memorabilia and information about this film, as well as a nice write up in Wikipedia."
2,Good for beginners upper body excercise only,There are two set of exercise: upper body and lower abdomen. It is a good supplement for building arms and chest but not for your abs. Fall short on this and you could injure your neck if not careful. I think new rubberbands cord are better and free weights.
4,Birthday present for nephew,I bought this item as a birthday present for my nephew and it was a wonderful choice. The item arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition.
1,Not functional - spoon is almost flat.,"I don't get all the good reviews for this. The spoon is so flat it would take a month to eat a bowl of soup...and most of it would end up on the floor. If all you want is an OK fork, then get this...but if you care about a spoon, set the bar really, really, really low."
4,as advertised,"it's a thomas the train set with carrying case. so far its durable. the carrying case is very convenient and functional. I bought this really a spare for my 2.5 year old son to keep in the bag b/c of the nice carrying case. Because of the pic, i thought it was a set of 4, but it's not. not munch angle on the utensils and the spoon is shallow, so it may be a little too flat for more experienced eaters. Points on the fork are dull, for safety, but can provide some challenge for picking items up. overall, a good set but i prefer to give my son the better utensils without thomas on it."
1,don't buy this book.,"Save your money and buy a real book. This book is so full of errors that there is an independent website where you can log the mistakes you find in the book. Harbin's explanations are simplistic and his English is marginal. After studying from this book for several weeks, I took it to my college instructor to ask him what I was doing wrong. He laughed and told me that I was doing the problems right but that the book was wrong and that he figured that about 8% of the answers in the book were just plain wrong. This is an awfully expensive book to be so riddled with errors. There is also the fact that this is the THIRD EDITION. Hello Harbin, you would think that after two tries he might get it right. I guess that as long as people keep buying the book for an exorbitant price someone will keep printing it. Save yourself the headache and expense and keep shopping."
5,Truly the only investment guide you will ever need!,"I purchased my first copy of Mr. Tobias's book when I was in my mid thirties and it truly changed my life. I found it to be such practical advice that I started following it immediately. Written in a self depreciating manner the author just made the complicated financial decisions we all mishandle or put off seem so simple. Insurance, banking, investments, clipping coupons, saving money - he addresses it all and you can understand it.I am now 56 and retired and I know a lot of it I owe to this book. Read it!"
1,I don't think so!,"Hopefully if you own this book you have not followed everything Tobias states to invest in. No doubt you could be picked out of a crowd because you would be the one wareing the ragged clothes begging for change. In fact let me let you in on another fact about this book. A person doing the opposite of most of the recommendations in this book would be doing extremely well about now. Don't be fooled, if you're savy on any type of investing, this book will insult your intelligence."
1,AVOID THIS BOOTLEG - IT SOUNDS TERRIBLE,"This CD is an illegal bootleg on an outlaw label from a source outside of the U.S. All of the Carpenters master recordings are controlled by Universal Music, which now owns A&M Records. This CD is made from scratchy records and has terrible artwork as well. This is not an authorized release. You need to buy the original Carpenters ""Horizon"" album for the proper source on most of these songs plus one of the Greatest Hits collection. This CD is total junk and should not be purchased under any circumstances. Beware!"
5,AWESOME,I bought this gift for my husband and 3 year old daughter to play together.They love it!It is great for pre math skills and problem solving skills.As a teacher and a mom I highly recommend this toy.
5,my 4 yr old loves this,We saw this in the gift shop of our local science museum and just gave it to 4 yr old daughter as a birthday gift. She's loving it! The two levels are perfect for her age. Level 1 shows how the shapes fit into the bigger picture. Level 2 either tests memory or creativity. Great puzzle.
5,Transcendent Photography,"Poems of Sorrow delivers a song to humanity, to women, to children, to age, and to grief and myth and darkness.Breathtaking to behold, rich with symbolism and supernatural energy, the imagery of Luis Gonzalez Palma is a spiritual and emotional experience.Maija Veide, New York"
3,"Good watch, weak watchband","The USB interface allows the user to have some fine features everywhere you go, like the other reviews say. I had trouble with the watchband, which broke and was hard to replace. The other problem was that the watch's software needed an update after it locked out the computer and gave a false ""low batt"" error, so get the update soon!"
5,One of the Best Kept Secrets,"Kavakas is probably the best violinist alive in the world today. If not the best he is in the top 3. This particular album is excellent, you will not be disappointed if you truly like classical music, especially world class violinists."
5,Delightful,I've owned three different version of the violin concertos. I am not a connoisseur but this one is the most delightful both from musically and technically (recording sound quality). The only exception is concerto #2: musically I prefer the Perlman / Levine version.
3,must be for older kids,my nephew loved this thing with the movement and talking but at 18 months he hasn't gotten the hang of the educational side yet. here's hoping he grows into it.
5,Great Toy for 6 months till 2 years (at least),"My son first played with this at a friends house when he was 6 mos. old and loved just playing with the animals. He received as a gift when he was just a year old and now is 19 months and plays with it all the time. He still loves playing with the animals, putting animals on the various stations where they talk to you. I keep thinking he is too rough with it and that it will break but it is still in one piece. i think he will keep playing with it and enjoying it. As he learns his abc's he will be able to see the letter and hear the sounds as he plays. Great toy!"
1,Badly Designed,"My 17 month old received this toy as a Christmas gift.He was eager to play, but unfortunately, the toy is designed so that in order to play with the train station, the toddler must sit on and/or kick the train tracks. The toy's babble resulting from the toddler inadvertently activating the alphabet train track is annoying at best. At worst it prevents the toddler from realizing and enjoying the features he is actually activating.Another design flaw is in the folding action of the toy. I imagine they were going for better storage ability, but the train station can easily tip forward onto the toddler as he is trying to play. Not much fun.The animals resemblance to the creatures they are meant to represent may be a little too abstract (our toddler could not recognize any of them and he's an animal nut).I do not recommend this toy."
4,"Great, but...","I loved the idea of this train for my 1 year old son. He gets a kick out of all the animal sounds. I love the bag that holds all the extras you get with it (comes with like 18 animals, signs and the train). However, he is still in the pulling up stage and the track is attached to the station, so whenever he leans on it he falls flat on his face. Other than that I love it!"
5,Good reading skills lend to the story of a crocodile which helps Peggy in both bath and bed,Mom and Dad are about to go out for the evening and poor Peggy is facing a crocodile under her bed. Luckily he's more interested in playing than eating - and the two friends enjoy a lively night in which fear turns to fun. Good reading skills lend to the story of a crocodile which helps Peggy in both bath and bed.
5,Well worth the money,"If your looking for professional quality paper , this is one of the best i have used. Great skin tones as close as you can get what you see on your monitor.Would highly recomend this paper to anyone and the price is great from Amazon.Papers I Would Recomend:Kodak Pro Lustre 8 1/2 X 11Ilford Classic Galarie Pearl 13 X 19These are the only papers i useYou get what you pay for , better quality prints"
2,Not as advertised,"I bought one of these for each of my children (7 and 4) for Christmas and we were disappointed that this did not come as advertised. The description says it comes with 24 oil pastels and 20 crayons... Well, it came with 24 crayons labeled as oil pastels and NO oil pastels. My daughter was specifically looking for oil pastels and was very disappointed when the ""Oil Pastels"" just turned out to be crayons. Instead of the oil pastels advertised there were water colors in one side. I had to go to an art store the day after Christmas and purchase what was supposed to be in this set to begin with."
4,Art Box,Art box comes with lots of supplies. I saw several reviews which had problems with quality of the box but the one I received was and still is fine.
2,It was just OK,A lot of details crammed together and not what a real beginner would need - as I am. Better if it was a Dummies Guide.
1,This Book Is Terrible,"I don't know where they came up with the ""Practical Issues"" part of the title. This book is painfully theoretical.It might be OK material for academic types, but I'm a SQL DBA and have real-world problems to solve. It goes on and on with this formal language about what the data represents and examples of what can go wrong with obviously-bad table designs. Not much help here.And instead of offering usable recommendations, the obviously-annoyed author makes worthless suggestions. For example, he suggests that instead of denormalizing for performance benefits, my best course of action is to ""demand better soltions from DBMS vendors"". I guess that instead of finishing my current project, I'll call Microsoft and demand a new release first.Skip this one.Matt"
4,I liked it!!!,"This is a great project and I think he did a great job!Sure the songs have at times a different flavor but nothing is lost from the original feeling of the songs.Alexandre has a great voice blending into a beautifully produce album.He just keeps getting better and better. Bring more on, its worth listening to over and over again."
3,Defective dvd,"The disc had no sound once the concert started. The opening credits had sound, but not the concert itself. I tried it in 2 different DVD players. I returned it and got a replacement. Same problem. I took it to a friends house, and it worked fine. Took it back to my house, and no sound. The concert was very good"
5,Surprisingly Nice!,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this ring, but have been pleasantly suprised thus far.The materials and craftsmanship definitely exceed the price paid for it. It it really does gives the appearance of looking more expensive than it actually is. It is comfortable to wear runs and true-to-size.The enameled design is finely done. From a distance it could look like tiny sapphires. I don't know the technical term, but where CZ is set there is actually a cut out, in the ring, behind the stone, it for maximum sparkle."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!,"The sound quality is abominable. It's below amazon's standards. This record company should be blindfolded and given a final cigarette. It's a ripoff compilation by a cut-rate record company. I thought it was just that the streaming demos sounded a little funky, but it's not....the purchased files are bad too. Be forewarned."
4,The Underneath of things. Marian Ferme,"This is a deeply researched piece on Mende beliefs and customs by a Social Anthropologist. It claims to be on Violence,History, and the Everyday in Sierra Leone. This it does not accomplish. It is rather a study of a certain tribe and limited to a defined geographic location within Sierra Leone.For someone interested in Mende culture it makes good reading,familiarizes one with unusual cultural practices. On the whole it gives you a better understanding of common phehomena which the casual by-stander would count as nought. It however requires concentrated reading, and for those who have travelled in Mendeland much reflection on incidents and practices that were once observed. I recommend this book for any student of African Philosophy, travellers, and also the casual curious types.Ked E. James, M.D.Petal, MS."
1,zzzzz.....,"If you can listen to this whole album without falling asleep, you may need to cut back on the heroin."
1,Russell Watson,Very unfortunate that the format of this DVD will not play in either of the DVD players in my home. One player is a high end Lexicon & the other is a Sony player. The return policy @ Amazon worked just fine..
2,not the same voice we love,"First of all, I'm a huge fan of Russell Watson. Sadly, at the time of the performance (one day after radiation treatment), he does not have the voice we love. I pray he gets it back. Mr Watson looks somewhat scared and is lacking his usual exuberance; the camera angles and programming content add to the somber mood.The best that can be said is his unmatched perfect ear allows him to create a new voice, but the new voice, though quite good, is not fantastic."
1,Things you should already know about poker,"This book is for beginners, and even then you would be much better off getting another book. I started out with an Internet Poker guide, and moved onto Harrington on Holdem I and II.Pass on this book unless you have never played poker in your life."
1,Havent read the book yet but.,"just to let you know. BARRY SHULMAN is the CEO of CARDPLAYER MAGAZINE. THE DEFINITIVE poker mag. most of todays top pros write in it and many published poker authors contribute strategy.Phil Hellmuth9 time WSOP Bracelet Winner, Scott Fishman First man to win Back to BACK bracelets in 36 hours, Daniel NegreanuWSOP PLAYER OF THE year 2004, Thunder Keller and Roy Cook all write for cardplayer..and Barrys son Jeff is an accomplished Player himself.Oh yeah, DONT speak as an authority on something you know nothing about."
5,Founder Winninger Institute For Market Strategy,I've thought it for years but you have confirmed it. It's the will not the skill.As a small town boy from Iowa with a lot of determination and not a lot of skill I was gratified and convinced by your book that where I am to day was based on my will.I will suggest your book to everyone who needs the will to win not just the skills to succeed. Thanks Jim I have waited a log time to hear your words and they are music to my ears! to my WILL!!
3,Nice try but not good enough,"This book was a good read, but nothing special. Once done I did not feel satisfied. While reading it I was waiting for the ending that would just blow me away but the conclusion was not satisfying at all. The nun ( only by name ) never realy acted as a nun. She did not indulge us in her religious ways that would have created a better compliment to the theives. She was just as devious as the criminals themselves which did not make her nun character anything relevent. I will continue to read Leanord's books, hopefully they will end with more of a bang than this one"
5,Great book - Now (10/19/2006) Out of Date,"That's the problem with these ""up to the moment"" books: they quickly get out of date. This was a book that has been on my list for a while. The book was excellent, but now--2 years later--we know so much more about this foul war and the fould things that have come from this war.I recommend this book--for what that's worth--with one caveat: know that it's now 2+ years post publication. If you're a news-hound, you already know everything within its pages."
3,Disappointing Mary Black,"I ordered this CD based on the existing reviews and was disappointed. I like the Celtic type songs. This CD has more modern ""American"" songs. Her voice is still beautiful, but the type of music was not what I was looking for."
1,Fails on all fronts,"The explication of the science is a failure. The ecology is poorly treated and the implications for evolution are under-addressed.As a piece of science-journalism it fails to ignite. The author spends too much time dwelling on her own success at becoming the first female pilot of deep-sea vessel, Alvin. She forgets the ""gee-whiz factor"" which is necessary for a book of this type.This is the only book I've given away in over 35 years. No strings attached."
5,Nice Double Feature,"The last two Dragonball Z films unfortunately but two very remarkable ones none the less. I consider ""Wrath of the Dragon"" to be the better of the two with its emotional storyline and great new character, Taipon. ""Fusion: Reborn"" is more comical but no less great in my opinion. Vegeta makes his usual sudden appearence but gets an emotional tid bit of his own in ""Fusion: Reborn"" and Gogeta's short screen time is by far my favorite scene in either film. The villains are fantastic and the remastered look of the films are incredible."
2,"Pretty Cast, Affluent Characters, Problems Galore","""Gossip Girl - The Complete Second Season"" is a seven-disc set that includes all 25 Season Two episodes of the satirical TV teen drama plus four hours of special features. Narrated by the unseen yet all-knowing ""Gossip Girl,"" the series revolves around the lives of privileged kids attending an elite private school in New York City. It's senior year for the Upper East Siders, and story lines focus on applying to colleges, blooming and fading romances, scandals rearing their heads, and loyalties shifting with lightning speed. If that's not enough to keep the melodrama percolating, reputations are destroyed and others made. DVD bonus features include a gag reel; a downloadable audio book of the best-selling novel ""Gossip Girl: You Know You Love Me"" by Cecily von Ziegesar, read by Christina Ricci; and a featurette on the creative forces behind the show's art and fashion."
3,Gossip Girl - 2nd Season,I did not watch this dvd as when it arrived I realized it was not the one I thought it was.
4,Toshiba notebook pc,We are full time RVers & rely on our computer for everything. So far this has been the best pc that we have purchased. We have had 2 other pc's & this is the first one that hasn't been a major pain within the first month. Our last was an HP & it was terrible. We use a VZ (Verizon) pc card. This computer comes with McAfee anti-virus installed. VZ tech support said that there is a major compatibility issue with McAfee & the VZ pc cards. I disabled all of the McAfee programs on the start up menu & installed Norton 2007 anti-virus. No problems at all.
1,Order Something with XP,I have had this computer for over a year and I wish I had never bought it. It biggest problem is that it has Windows Vista and that OS is the worst thing I have ever purchased from Microsoft. Vista is a memory hungry worthless piece of bloated eyewash. Additionally I can't replace the OS with my XP Pro because this computer has no drivers for XP Pro. I am a fairly tech savy person and I think windows Vista and Office 2007 are a waste of money and since this laptop can only use Vista it too is a waste. I only wish our anti trust laws had more teeth. I am forced to use Windows because of my real estate career since that is what our MLS uses. If it weren't for this I would be a total Mac guy. As for Amazon they are top notch and I buy from them before anyone else these days
3,Title shouldn't throw you off,"I enjoyed this- but, not as much as Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. some parts of this were corny but it is fun ,cheap entertainment"
3,It was Ok.,"My son liked it, but I really didn't care for it myself. But it was time spent with them since my husband passed away."
2,Lincoln vs Zombies,"You see Abraham Lincoln, vampire slayer on tv then see Abraham Lincoln vs the zombies on Amazon Prime. Not thinking or reading clearly, I ordered the wrong movie. The slayer one is not even out as of this review. This movie is okay but not what I was looking for. Definietely not work the price charged to watch it."
4,Bill Ding toys,"(Not quite as durable as the Bill Ding toy when I grew up), these building toys sit on my science room desk for students to create new stacks. They don't realize they learn about center of balance and levers in a creative way. Bill Ding gets repeated daily teenager use and are replaced each year. This is a fun toy."
4,Not the same old story.,"This is a very inventive and gritty mystery with a very likable and unique narrator and supporting cast. Plus, the hero's business, auctioning off antiques, makes for an engrossing setup. While scouting the house of a wealthy elderly woman, our protaganist finds some very intriguing photos. Her request is that he destroy all that he finds in her deceased brother's private room. He doesn't.I read a lot of mysteries. And I truly appreciate one that has complex characters and tells a good story. One that you haven't read several times before.This is a good read. It's offbeat and not for the squeamish. The details can be disturbing and there is sexual content some might find offensive.I didn't."
2,Finish bad within 1 month,"After less than 1 month of use, the entire exterior of the chiminea is spotted, pitted, and streaked. It does not come off. i sent pictures off to Blue Rooster, who promptly replied that it was called OXIDATION, and could be easily fixed with a good scrub down and a couple of coats of high heat BBQ paint. I really don't feel that I should have to go through this after less than a month. If what is needed to prevent this from happening is a couple of coats of high heat BBQ paint, then why wasn't this applied at the factory? I am waiting to see how this will be resolved.The company has refunded the purchase price in full. I do not know why the finish turned so bad so fast, however am pleased with the way the company handled it. I feel that I should add that, apart from the finish, there was nothing else wrong with the chiminea"
4,Must Read,This book should be required reading for every true believer and for those that want to become one.
2,The Harvest,Rick Joyner wrote this book a few years ago and a friend recommended that I get this book. I read this book and the revelations that Rick discusses were being preached by myself and others 30 years ago. There is nothing new in this book but a reaffrimation of what we were preaching years ago! A good book!
4,"Great mug, but...watch out!","They are great mugs, heavy and thick. My only complain is that the handle gets super hot when I use it to boil water in the microwave to make tea. Just try to remember to use a kitchen towel or pot holder to get it out of the microwave."
3,pretty good,not bad gloves. a bit small but fits fine without wraps. there are much better gloves out there now for training that allow wraps and have more padding with gel. overall not bad though.
1,could have been great...,"... I spent half an hour on this game before getting bored out of my mind then another painstaking half hour TRYING to enjoy it but it was a lost cause (Was that a pun?). This game could have simply been GTA with a little twist and it probably would have been a top seller but instead it fails miserably.The enviroment may be huge but it ALL LOOKS THE SAME! The gameplay is unchallenging and there appears to be no enemy AI at all. All in all the whole thing becomes repetitive to the point where you no longer care about the story line or the character, or what the hell you're supposed to be doing. I hate to be blowing a trumpet for GTA San Andreas, but at least I got to know my way around that game without a map because there was enviromental change between cities and an engrossing storyline. Oh and you could jump out of planes in that game too!"
5,"Success story in community development, w/difficult odds","A little too much detail. However, this is an inspiring success story about a community in very bad shape, that turned itself around totally, working ""from the inside out"". Well known in the field of community development, in my area."
2,"Good novel, but too much of a copy of Gabo's work","This novel would have been a lot more interesting if I had not read One Hundred Years of Solitude beforehand. I found it to be a poor (in relative terms) imitation of Garcia Marquez's masterpiece. I was neither moved nor touched by the saga of the decaying family precisely because the Buendia's power is unmatched. Allende is a writer of much talent, but let's say that originality is not her strong point. I saw the same thing happen with Afrodita and Como Agua Para Chocolate...please, there are some well-read people out there...give us a break."
1,Wrong Order,Sent me the wrong item. Thanks a lot now I am failing my spanish class. Not very happy wirh them.
1,Boring,Found it quite boring and could not finish it. Feels like a west/north european's landing in Mediterranean and simply observing events like an alien.
2,Disappointed mom,I purchased this product for my daughter's 4th birthday. After one day one of the wheels fell off. My husband reattached it and everytime we have ever moved it the wheel falls off. Now the wheel won't even stay on at all so the easel is lopsided and unusable. The quality does not match the price. Get a $20 easel and save your money.
1,defective part and damaged wheel,"Just recieved this Art Cart and when I was sorting the parts discovered minor damage to one of the wheels....no big deal. Then as we were putting it together we discovered that the wheel support had NO groove for the bottom shelf to slide into. Called Alextoys directly and they are out for inventory control until Jan. GREAT CART, But absolutely WORTHLESS if you can't put it together without MAJOR modifications!Now I'm rushing out to find another gift! shheeesh!"
5,Informational,"I thought the information presented in the book was outstanding. I had no idea what these women endure everyday of their lives. Our society is getting worse then it has been or it has always been this way. Since we can get any kind of information in seconds, then this is an example of what our society really wants."
5,Eye opening.,"A brilliantly researched history that helped America realize the true nature of homosexuality at a time when the New England style, pro-perversion, media-inspired mob mentality was at its peak."
1,As laughable as it is evil,"Any reasonable person will surely recognize this book for what it is--a desperate, frail attempt to inflame the sensible mainstream of American society with lies, deceptions and make-believe history. While the radical right continues to lose the culture war (witness Bush's gay appointees, domestic partnership laws in CA and VT, and the popularity of shows like ""Will & Grace,"") they resort to malicious tactics that will only alienate them further from average Americans.Along with such hateful tracts like ""The Turner Diaries,"" this book is as evil as it is historically inaccurate. Hitler himself would surely find a kindred spirit in Mr. Lively."
2,Not up to his best,"I found this to be a slow moving story that had a good premise with a weak outcome. A corporal being escorted to Cairo to be tried for the murder of his commanding officer changes place with the military policeman guarding him when the latter dies of a heart attack. Upon arrival, the policeman was to have led a search for a spy in Egypt supplying Rommel with military secrets. Great premise, but the book was uninteresting and contrived from that point on. I finished it, but wouldn't have minded if I hadn't. I see it's out of print and relatively unobtainable (I got mine on a bargain book table) which is where it belongs."
3,"Good, agressive cd","Waterdown tries hard, give them that. This cd has a lot of hardcore breakdowns, some melody and some catchy lyrics. Overall, this band sounds pretty upset and it comes out in their music. This is probably the best overall Waterdown cd yet, but honestly, that's not saying much at all."
2,Dangerous toy,This toy is really poorly made. The edges are rough and splinters come off of it. I am returning it right away. This toy could harm a small child. I would recommend buying a KidCo brand sorter. They are much better finished.
5,another sabbath classic,"many people consider sabbath's second album with ronnie james dio,mob rules not to be as good as the first with dio ,heaven and hell.i disagree.i'm not saying mob rules is better than heaven and hell but it's just as good.they are both classics.standout tracks on this cd and my personal favorites are falling off the edge of the world,mob rules,voodoo,country girl and slipping away.the other tracks turn up the night,e5150,over and over and the sign of the southern cross are also great songs and worth a listen to.i recommend this cd to everyone."
5,Is this really 20 years old???,"I've been a fan of Black Sabbath since I was a kid and a Dio fan when I was a young teen. Dio with Sabbath though??? I wasn't sure on what to think until I heard the title track...This album doesn't sound like it should be the age that it is. It's a different sound since the Ozzy days, but still that shouldn't make you like it any less. The music is heavy, the lyrics amazing...I wished that I had bought this years ago. If you're a fan of either Sabbath or Dio, you won't be disappointed."
3,mob rules black sabbath,"Another heavy offering from Dio and the Sabbath crew, a must for all Dio fans. I saw this line up back in 1980 in Sydney at the princess theatre and got blown away , it doesnt get any better.Not as good as Heaven and Hell which is one of the top 3 rock albums of all time.Bass fans will love Geezers work which as always is outstanding.In the words of Dio we rock .cheers."
2,Very Mediocre Eighties Synth Pop!,"I bought this cd not knowing anything about the band but a friend had bought their last cd (""Don't Cut Your Fabric....) and raved about them. After listening to the cd in it's entirety my conclusion is that Action Action are trying to be a cross between Depeche Mode, The Cure and maybe a touch of Elvis Costello. I didn't care for the singer's phoney English accent (I believe the band is from Chicago) and his voice gets annoying real fast. There really weren't any songs that I liked. For lovers of today's new groups that have the retro eighties sound I would suggest Franz Ferdinand, The Bravery, The Killers and The Kaiser Chiefs instead of Action Action."
2,Invacare 30 gauge,"I was not happy with this product. Even though the name and gauge were the same as the other lancets that I received, the quality for this batch of lancets was not. The needle length and diameter were not consistent. I had to change my depth settings multiple times. The needles were painful to use. All other batches of 30 gauge lancets were fine."
4,Enjoyable read,"This book is the other part of ""A Notorious Lady"". It contains the details of Phoebe and Jordan's romance. I enjoyed it but didn't think it was as good as some of Blair's other books. I would recommend it though, along with the above mentioned."
2,outdoor 5 piece coffee set,"If the metal was any thiner you could see through it. The lid has come off after a couple of uses, was repaired easly but attached very poor. This is not the enamel I was acquainted with."
1,"I didn't see this film, BUT...","here's YET ANOTHER! gay film with 2 attractive men topless on the DVD cover. REALLY??? Really?? How could I possibly take your film seriously Mr. Director/Producer/Whatever??! Yes, I can judge a book (or movie) by its cover and I do! If you're going to spoon-feed me before I even begin to watch your film then I'm out! I ususally have to go the the female/female films to get me some lgbt depth. I'm a gay guy and just so disappointed by the trash out there. I guess I really do need to write a film, and when I get courted by rich producers and directors the contract will read ""Only Dan can design the DVD Cover for fear of complete and utter sterotypically gay male imagry!"". Sheesh!! Can we all just please grow up? just a little?"
3,"Great music, but 39 minutes?","As a Philip Glass fan of the first order I'm pleased to hear him return, as he says in the liner notes, ""to orchestral music where the subject of the work is the language of music itself, as in the tradition of the 18th and 19th century symphonies."" Based on the music alone, I would give this CD 5 stars, but seeing as how it offers less than 40 minutes of music, I can't give it more than 3. Come on, Orange Mountain Music, you claim you have a wealth of unreleased Philip Glass material that has been recorded over the past 30 years. Why didn't you put at least 30 minutes of it on this CD?"
5,Delighted Grammy,"I bought this for Christmas for my 15month old granddaughter and she just loves it! Don't forget to buy extra batteries for this one though. One of the really nice things about this is that all of the pieces work with any of the other ""Smartville"" products. I also bought her the ""Smartville"" firehouse and she can play with them together and if I buy others for her she can really have her own ""village"". It seems to be a really well built product and has enough ""things to do"" to keep a little one busy."
4,"Very fun, immersive, great for a couple to play together","My wife and I played this game over the span of a week, off and on and really enjoyed it. The playability is very much improved over the first pc game. The cases are very well thought out, logical, yet with a few twists along the way. The fifth case was very fun with the laser tracking. The graphics on the 360 version are a little lacking, and the mouth movements are very weak, but can be overlooked. If you are a fan of mystery games, or of the csi tv shows, im sure youll be happy with this game."
1,How can you have twists and turns in a linear world?,"Fan of the series, but linear storyline presents no challenge.Would really benefit from a ""free motion"" environment, like Oblivion, or just about any other game out there, today. You feel confined within a very small part of your ""scene"" and checkboxes to confirm you've done all you can do in each area kinda takes away the mystery.Entertaining (somewhat), and a time burner, but very little satisfaction."
4,"Caprice, So Whimsical And Strong","Doris Day plays a swinging, mod-attired agent of espionage (yes, that's Doris Day) in this caper comedy directed by Frank Tashlin. Patricia Fowler (Day) is an industrial spy who is hired to work undercover at a cosmetics company. While posing as a low-level employee, she is to get the goods on a new formual they intend to market. However, it turns out that makeup isn't all this firm has to sell; they're also involved in an international drug smuggling ring, and she finds herself doing battle with other agents willing to kill to insure the flow of narcotics is unabated. Her adventures cause her to cross paths with Christopher White (Richard Harris), a fellow agent with whom Patricia is soon romantically involved, and together the couple locate the secret lab of cosmetics tycoon and evil genius Stuart Clancy (Ray Walston).This is not one of Doris's best films. But truly a must see for diehard Doris Fans. Full of mystery, intrigue and espionage."
2,Caprice,'Caprice' is not really the fun-type Doris Day movie I was expecting. There was also no chemistry between her and Richard Harris.
3,Ball & Video Good / Pump needs improved,"The ball is very good quality and nice looking, so you don't feel you have to hide it. The video is clear, paced well and takes into account we're not all in the same physical condition. The pump is hard to use and cheaply made. I'd have rather spent a couple of dollars more and had a pump that matched the quality of the ball."
2,not up to par,I loved Scottoline's previous books. I found the stereotyping in this book just a little much and it felt 'cranked' out and underpolished.
3,Pigeon Readers,"Judy Carrier, a blonde law review member of Bennie Rosato's all woman law firm, takes the case of Pigeon Tony Lucia, a 79-year-old South Philly guy who killed his life long enemy Angelo Coluzzi. Unfortunately, everything is overdone, especially Judy's independent investigations in the face of Coluzzi family reprisals.A cast of ethnic characters, Tony Two Feet, Tony from down the block, friend Mary DiNunzio's parents and Coluzzi's gofer Fat Jimmy Belloo and his ex-wife Maureen, add some spice to the story. The trial is ridiculous with some obvious miscues by either author or reader (I'm reviewing the unabridged audio version) on what objecton was waged by whom. Judy out maneuvers an obnoxious prosecutor, but Pigeon Tony insists on speaking his piece and things get complicated.In the end Judy and Tony's hunk of a grandson Frank resume the romance that started on the case, but Lisa Scottoline will have to find someone else to buy the sequel."
5,I sought out this shoe,My husband and I have been together for 11 years and he had been wearing the same pair of shoes the entire time. He is not really easy on his shoes and only wears one pair until they wear out. These ones finally started to wear out in the tread. I decided to get him a new pair as a gift and I would look for no other shoe but these. He says they haven't really changed in the past decade and were comfortable right away! We hope to get another 10+ years out of these.
3,Disappointed,"I ordered this shoe based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews and my one opportunity to try on a pair in my size at a local store. At the latter, I was impressed by the solid-feel construction, especially at the bottom of this shoe (almost looks more like that of a trail/hiking boot). I have nerve damage on my left leg which makes walking regularly painful when bearing full weight, so I was looking for an athletic shoe with plentiful support and stability. While this shoe does look and feel solid, I found it to be sorely (no pun intended) lacking in cushioning the foot itself, and it wore a bit tight for a 9.5 MED. I was so hoping it was going to be my 'daily walker' shoe, but ended up returning it for a full refund. Kudos to Amazon for allowing for that & the quick processing of my refund. On the plus side, the price for the size was terrific, just not a good fit for my needs."
1,I can't believe they charged me $15 for this!,"This is a hideous movie. Just a bunch of old, ugly whores masturbating. Their privates look worn out from all the action from various toys."
1,This is not what I ordered.,I don't even know how I got htis because I never ordered this. I ordered a flipping microphone. I will never shop on Amazon again.
4,not bad tire inflator,"Just bought one today. Tested it and it works fine.Pros:Gauge is fairly accurate (better one so far)Not bad overall build quality, slightly beefier than the other cheap ones i've seenThe tire valve plug seals very well and comes off just as easily - GREAT !The cables wrap around the case and fits snugly inside the compressor neatlyNice compact sizeNice carry case.Cons:Loud as hellLifespan: unknown yetConclusion: not bad for a cheap compressor. If you are looking a cheap decent compressor this is it."
3,compressor great slime not,I had a small nail in my rear tire close to the outside tread. I deflated my tire took nail out and squeezed in the slime. I pumped up the tire in 10 minutes. The slime never sealed the hole. The compressor worked like a charm and allowed me to pump the tire up in order to make it to store to buy a new tire.
2,Attitude ruins everything,"Way way too long. Even the good stuff loses impact when it's floating in a sea of randomness, sloppy musicianship and dismal vocals.Pete seems so convinced of his genius and the loyalty of his fans that even farts and burbs will be welcomed rapturously.Half of the songs (almost all the good ones: Albion, the good parts of la belle et la bete, Killimajaro, Back from the Dead, Sticks and Stones, 32 of December, parts of A Rebours, In love with a feeling) are inferior versions of ones he wrote when he was still in the Libertines, drawn out and repeated over and over.Save your money and download Pete's acoustic versions of these songs from a time when he could still sing."
2,The Real Talent is with Paul Barat,"After listeng to the babyshambles cd and the Dirty pretty things cd, it is obvious that Doherty is lost,unfocused and has taken to many drugs. The songs are mediocre nowhere resemble the energy,talent or enthusiam of the Libertines.However Dirty pretty things displays the energy,enthusiam and agnst of the Libertines.Paul Barat was the driving force of the Libertines and Doherty was just a good singer.So skip this and buy Waterloo to anywhere (DPT) that is if you really likedthe Libertines.Skip this and buy Dirty Pretty Things, this is a depressing cd coming from an ex Libertine."
2,Ridiculous,"Once again Catherine Coulter has written a very stupid book! I could not believe she could actually call this a love story. If I want to read porn books, I would go to the adult shop. I hate the explicit sex scenes in her books. I am looking for love, not lust. And then to have an uncle who would treat a neice this way, like a sex object, come on Catherine. I hate her books and have read quite a few, almost all hoping for a good one. Well there have been maybe 2 out of the 100 or so she's written. Jade Star was my favorite. She is drawn out and boring in most of her books,and she always overuses words.Can't she come up with any new ones? Don't bother with this one girls, yuk."
2,Can't properly run a LCD television.,"The unit does work and seems built pretty well but when I turn the unit on it makes a constant buzzing noise. My main gripe with this unit is,you cannot properly use a LCD tv with it. When you plug in your tv to the unit, your tv will instantly start making a unhealthy buzzing noise. It makes the noise even when you have not turned on the television. The tv will turn on but you can tell it is not happy. I will be returning the unit and buying a lower wattage more expensive Pure Sine Wave Inverter. I took the chance that this would work for all of my electronics like the add says, but no dice. It does power my router, modem, cable boxes, lamp, Directv SWIM box, and laptop computer. Will find out if PURE SINE WAVE is worth 300% more than MODIFIED WAVE INVERTER."
1,Don't buy the kindle edition!,"I thought I was buying the book, not the sheet music. Buyer beware! The book is supposed to be excellent. They should have done a better job labeling it and I should have read more carefully."
4,"Great, but...","I am volunteering at my child's school, reading books to the class dealing with subjects such as bullying. Today I read this book. While I thought it was very good, I have to admit I was uncomfortable with the part that said ""in God's eyes we are all the same"". I understand what the author was getting at - that we're all special and worthwhile, even if we're different from our peers, but not everyone believes in God. I wanted to find a way to rephrase that line, but couldn't.The class enjoyed the book, and everyone said they learned something from it, which in this case is the most important part. After we finished reading, each child shared an experience where they had been teased, ridiculed or left out. It was a very good session with the class."
4,for lovers of liquid tango,"This is great modern tango for lovers of liquid tango - new tango with an eclectic edge. I love dancing to almost every track and if only I could find enough great partners out there I'd be dancing non-stop as there's so much potential to create fantastic dances in response to it. However, if you're a non-dancer this is still a great CD with wonderful tracks that will be great backdrops for any laid-back social gathering or to chill out with a coffee on a lazy Sunday morning."
5,Perfect for building finger strength.,"First of all, I can guarantee anyone that says the Grip Masters are too easy to use are using it wrong. An ideal way to strengthen fingers is to place only your thumb on the palm pad and press down with the tip of each finger one at a time. If you don't do much with your hands you'll be fine with the red, but may want to get a lighter one to work your pinky up. Of course, do the red one every day and eventually your pinky will be able to do it anyway.There are a number of different exercises to do with this thing to strengthen different areas of your forearm and palm. It fits perfectly in a pants pocket so you can grip it anywhere. Although they've gone for a cheaper design by reducing the amount of padding in the palm, it makes no difference. It's still comfortable to use and won't hurt your palm even if you have Buckethead-sized hands."
2,What a joke!,I don't know what kind of feeble fingers these other reviewers have but using this particular hand exerciser (black) is not a challenge whatsoever. This item offers an incredibly weak level of resistance. I'm a woman and judging by the name and the color I thought I might hurt myself using this but it's almost like moving my un-trained fingers through thin air. I'm returning mine.
3,"Great idea, let's take it one step further","So I like it. It's mainly for people trying to improve fingering on a guitar. It's also helpful for all those other things the company lists. But it builds callouses and builds fingertip strength. The one improvement I would recommend is that the spring on pinky be weaker than the rest.Think for a second. Should the tension on the spring that works your pinky be the same as your index finger? Shouldn't even be close. So at this point, you might need two of these at the two different tensions to properly work out your index/middle fingers and your ring/pinky fingers."
4,HAND EXERCISER.,"Thanks for your fast shipment,This item is well made.I am planning on purchasing the next level of tension( Red) I am very happy with the product.Now my guitar practice is coming along very well, thanks to this hand exerciser."
2,Product not as described.,"The product is listed as designed for men with ""very strong hands."" I am in good shape, but I wouldn't consider myself very strong. I am 19 years old and only about 170 pounds. When the gripmaster arrived I began using it and I felt that it was almost effortless. I don't think that I have very strong hands, but I wanted a challenge so I bought the ""heavy tension"" model. They shouldn't have pictures of bodybuilders using the product if it isn't even a legitimate workout for someone like me. Now I don't even know how much I should move up by due to their inaccurate description."
2,Who left the thumbs out?,"My criticism of this product is in the title. While it might help strengthen the fingers, I find it does little for the thumbs. I think a tennis ball would be a better all-around hand strengthener."
4,Should have gottten the medium,"I bought this to strengthen my hands and fingers for playing a steel string acoustic guitar. I decided to get the light resistance based on another user's recommendation. I'm a female and I've been working out for years although I've never really done anything to strengthen my hands/forearms, but after only 2 or 3 days with this it's already getting too easy. If you're a guy and considering it for the same reason I would say to definitely start out with the medium, and if you're a regular at the gym, maybe even start out with the one with the heaviest resistance."
2,Light,"Its pretty light, even for a single finger for an adult man. I bought all three and this heavy tension is even light. I like the ones from Ironminds better."
5,Convenient way to strengthen hands and fingers,I got this idea from my son for whom I purchased a 9-lb per finger Gripmaser almost 2 years ago. Some of my fingers are getting numb when I wake up in the morning and I feel they are getting weak. So I got these to strengthen my fingers. I do it while working in front of my laptop and while driving (one hand at a time). I've noticed I am stronger and am able to open bottle caps and jars that I needed my son's help before. I recommend this product. Amazon.com always has fast and good service.
4,An Excellent Practice Tool,This my second Gripmaster. A set of Ruff Caps completes this to make a excellent practice tool for when you're away from your guitar for any length of time. The Gripmaster/Ruff Caps helps to build and maintain finger strength and callus'. I also have the heavy tension Gripmaster and alternate between tools. I've purchased the X-Light tensions grips for my son to build on. The other adjustable grips just don't do the job or stand up to heavy usage. It can go into your pocket and go anywhere with you. I use it at home and at work without any trouble.This is a very good tool for any beginner or seasoned guitar player.The only reson I didn't give a rating of five stars is you have to purchase the Ruff Caps seperately.
5,Very Good Products,"I purchased both the 7 lbs. and 9 lbs. tension units and I'm extremely satisfied with both models. Both models allow for independent work on particular fingers or your grip as a whole. My hand strength, which had been decreasing a bit as I age, has returned very quickly as has increased freedom of movement through fingers. Whichever level of tension you choose I'm sure you will be satisfied with the Gripmaster."
3,too uncomfortable for me to use on a daily basis,Length:: 1:37 MinsMy purpose was to build up my forearm and grip. some say that this product is excellent for guitar players and I can see how this product assists in playing a guitar
4,Great looking T-Shirt,"T-Shirt looks the same as product picture here on Amazon, so feel free to order. I also have to confirm size mismatch - XL is in reality XXL so be careful when ordering. I ordered XXL first, but after reading comments I've changed to XL and it fits perfectly. I would be happier if it is 100% cotton, but even with some polyester in it, T-shirt feels nice."
3,Bland,"There were not many choices for dogs, so I chose this one. However, the painting could have been better. The photo looks better than the dogs I received. Two in my box had basically the same plain yellow (cream-colored) lab coats, as if the manufacturer got tired of completing the painting and just left the base color. I wonder if I could make one into a chocolate lab on my own to create some diversity."
3,I was hoping for more,"If you know absolutley nothing about the music business and have never read a book about it, this is a good starting book. I was hoping for more figures though. There's not enough step by step diagnosis. It's more of a review of the different aspects of label promotion, signing, etc..."
3,A Basic Read,"I read this book thinking I would walk away with the know how to start my own label as the title suggests, but that wasn't the case at all. The author explains some of the basics behind the business based on her own experience, but doesn't get into the details behind the A - B start up. I would recommend this book to someone interested in running a record label. It will help kick-start an interest and promote new ideas you wouldn't normally think of. She covers different types of deals and suggestions on running a business, however, I would move to a more informative book if you are truly serious."
3,ok if you are a beginner,"I think this one is ok if you are a beginner, but feel that most people with experience will find it a little boring. If you have no idea about the music business, I think this is a bargain for (). However, if you're out there playing in clubs and looking for something a little more focused on helping you make that happen. I really like ""How I Make $100,000 in Music"" by David Hooper to help you with understanding how music business people think, the Indie Bible by David Wimble to help you with contacts, and the Jeri Goldstein book about booking to put it all together."
2,Chain on silver ball twice as long,"I thought these earrings were cute and still do, as they are pictured. However, the pair I received (Dec 2009) had a chain that was twice as long as it should be. The earrings didn't look right. I contacted the seller and they offered to replace it, but, the cost of sending it back was as much as the earrings, so it wasn't worth it. Hope yours looks like the picture."
2,Beatifull but very small,"These earings are fine, are cheap, but the picture make you think that they are a quite bigger than they are."
1,Dragonball Y,"How do you break an addiction to the Dragonball series? My kid watches them incessantly, and it's like watching Barney the Dinosaur reruns. The first time was one too many. Don't get started."
5,The DBZ Finale!!,"The finale of the most popular and by far the best anime series ever!! Not only completing the Buu saga but the whole shabang, season nine is one not to forget for sure. This time the action really is non stop, with an unforgettable fight on each disc, or each episode really. Gotenks becomes a super saiyan three, Gohan reaches a new level of power, and the ultimate warrior strong enough to make even make Majin Buu seem helpless is born: Vegetto!! And Buu goes through several forms, my favorite being Super Buu Gotenks absorbed. It all leads to the final battle against Kid Buu where every one on Earth must stand up to this seemingly immortal threat."
5,Dragon Ball Z: Season Nine (Majin Buu Saga),Perfect for a fan because you don't have to worry about it being censored and you have every episode at you fingertips.
1,Great series horrible packaging,Its the end of an era. Its a great series. Its a box set that comes with scratched discs no matter what you do. If you are a collector then look elsewhere for your set. I have bought this set 3 times and every time there are discs scratched (especially disc 3) and/or discs loose. I don't understand why its so hard to make a thin pack or some other decent quality box set. Quick money/cheap product.
2,a tribute!,"I listened this cd two times, i really don't like it, some things are good, if I think about Lila Downs, and some others, but this cd is not for me!"
4,A Great Outline of Six Sigma,This book is touted as a primer and that it outlines for employees the core ideas of Six Sigma and I found that it did just that. The authors work their way through the Six Sigma process step by step and in a clear easy to follow manner that anyone could benefit from.For me I was a little disappointed because I wanted more detail about Six Sigma but that is not the intention of this book (as described on the backcover) and as such should not have been expected by me.This is a great book for anybody who wants a quick overview of what six sigma is or for those who want to get some basics under their belt before they begin Six Sigma training. I learned enough here that I feel confident enough to understand the pros and cons of Six Sigma and capable to begin reading higher level texts on the subject.
5,"Another ""must have"" for the well traveled wargamer","I must admit I had not heard of ""Floor Wars"" prior to reading ""Little Wars"". The book predates ""Little Wars"" but is often considered a companion to the other book. It focuses more on the collecting and building of settings than actual wargaming. The books compliment each other well. ""Floor Wars"" sparked my imagination even more...taking me back to the little countries and armies that I used to think up in my youth. It was amusing listening to Wells go on about how good figures for certain periods and ranges were not available. I guess nothing really changes after all!"
5,a perfect reproduction!,"I had heard about Floor Games around the time I got Little Wars, but this was the first time I had actually seen it or read it. This is a slightly larger format than their edition of Little Wars and it is very nice looking. The information Well's offers on creating scenery for your war games was particularly interesting to me."
4,Recommend this,"I'm a big fan of murder mysteries and would recommend this one. It delves into the scientific side without going so far as to lose readers who aren't DNA-minded. You still get the idea of what was being done and why it caused problems.My only slight complaint would be that I needed an Scottish to American dictionary to understand some of the terms and slang, but I was able to figure out most of it by context. ""Cairn,"" for instance, is an entirely new concept to me.Overall, the book is well written and I'll be looking for more of Scott's stuff.I realize that some readers might shy away from this book because it involves lesbians, but the relationships in this book are no different than what you would find in any other murder mystery. Though several of the characters have been (or are) lovers, their relationships are closer to friendships."
4,Can't go wrong with this collection,"Several comments have been made lamenting the fact that not all of Roberta Flack's bg hits were included on this CD and maybe these folks have a valid point. Nontheless, this lineup of most of her best songs is a delight and pure ear candy that brings back nice memories of the 1970s when Flack was at her peak. Her best duets with Donnie Hathaway are included, as is the hit with Peabo Bryson, ""Tonight, I Celebrate My Love"". Ms. Flack and Aretha Franklin were arguably the most popular R&B female singers of the '70s, including the temperamental Motown diva, Diana Ross. Even with a few forgivable omissions, all fans of Roberta Flack will enjoy this CD."
3,A little frustrating,"The CD itself is in great shape and I am very happy with my purchase. I did have problems with the delivery. I never received the first order, and I waited and I waited. I finally had to request a second. All in all, because of this, it took twice as long as it should have to receive the CD."
1,The Very Best Of Roberta Flack,VERY DISSAPOINTED.... THIS CD DOWNLOADED AS A.AMZ FILE THAT MY COMPUTER HAS NO IDEA WHAT TO DO WITH... AND GOING ONLINE TO OPEN IT LOADS SOFTWARE THAT SEEMS TO WANT TO DO EVERYTHING TO MY CDOMPUTER EXCEPT OPEN WHAT IS SUPPOSE TO BE MP3 FILES OF A CDE..... DISSAPOINTED... THE OTHER TWO DOWNLOADS WERE MP3 SONGS THAT I COULD LISTEN TO IMMEDIATELY... WHAT HAPPENED
5,Its about the music,"The music speaks for itself, its a piece of classic history. The 3 weeks it took to arrive were unexceptable and make me very unlikely to purchase from Amazon in the near future."
4,Great little addition to the single gals kitchen,"I received this as a gift last Christmas, and use it everyday. With a 1 bedroom condo in a Chicago high-rise it was the perfect solution for limited counterspace. I get compliments on it from friends that visit.It's easy to clean and the toaster oven side works fast!The only drawback is preparing coffee for more than one person. The 4-cup pot is, in today's reality, one nice sized mug of coffee."
5,A must read...,This is a fantastic book for anyone trying to understand the spiritual realm. It is a very easy read without scholarly terms so any reading level can understand and enjoy it. This book focuses on explaining demonic influences and even discusses whether Christians can become possessed or not. It was very much worth the money as all Sumrall books are.
2,Order it from the library!!,"This book reminded me of the original ""Charlie's Angels girls"" ...frothy, inane, and embarrassing. This is definitely not up to par with Scottoline's other books. My advice is to save your [money] and just order this from the library, if you really need to waste a few hours of reading time"
1,Worst book ever read,Half-way through I realized I was skimming because I didn't care-AT ALL. This book has the most inane conversations-EVER. High school students could do a better job. MY god- how did she even get published???????
4,Good summer reading,"I took this on vacation and it was good summer reading and I liked the Philadelphia/Camden local color...although poor Camden always gets bad press--the three lawyers cross the bridge from Philly to Camden and, of course, they go to a sleazy motel in Camden to help solve the mystery."
2,Only so so,"I usually enjoy Lisa Scottoline's novels. But this one was lame. It spends way too much time on Anne trying to catch her stalker. There was no sense of reality about the whole story. Hopefully, the next book in the series is a improvement. I wouldn't waste by time reading this one."
1,Author betrays readers....,"With fiction, it is a reader's obligation to willfully suspend disbelief. However, here, the author continually betrays the reader by constantly challenging the readers ability to willfully suspend disbelief.We have one of the dumbest protagonists in the history of fiction, and we are supposed to believe she is sharp.The protagonist time and again takes stupid chances--the type of things that a charcter in a low-budget horror flick might do.An Irish American cop speaks with a brogue and an Italian American family speaks with an accent and believes in old-country traditions--all in the same book.Stupid. Stupid. Stupid."
3,It is what it is...,"Attorney Lisa Scottoline's ninth and newest thriller is lighter than air, set in Philadelphia over a Fourth of July weekend. As these things go, it's a well-crafted and totally readable book.Her heroine is a troubled beauty, Anne Murphy, a recent hire in the all-female law firm featured in earlier Scottoline mysteries, who's come East to escape a stalker (or ""erotomaniac""). In a case of mistaken identity, Murphy is thought to have been murdered at the outset of the weekend. She evades the media, reveals herself to a few trusted associates, and sets out to catch the killer, presumably the stalker, and thus ensure her future safety. Along the way, there are little nuggets of wisdom -- the importance of family and so forth.Here's a book that you could whip through in an afternoon on the beach, or a three-hour plane ride. It's entertaining enough, in a cotton candy sort of way. It's nicely done, but like cotton candy, it just sort of melts away."
2,Nod to Laura,"Courting Trouble by Lisa Scottoline continues the story of the all female law firm in Philadelphia led by Bennie Rosato. The protagonist Anne Murphy is the new kid on the Rosato legal team joining Mary DiNunzio and Judy Carrier, and Murphy carries this story quite well. She is a compulsive shopper and is the beautiful model type who fits in more easily with her male counterparts until she gets murdered, well sort of, and then the female bonding starts. The novel is nicely structured and Anne Murphy is likable, but I guessed who the murderer was early on. That's a definite negative, unless the novel has loads of atmosphere to make up for it, which this one doesn't. In addition, the entire murder scene was right out of a novel written in 1943 by Vera Caspary, Laura. Although the plot was different, the murder was absolutely the same. I would have thought that in the acknowledgements or somewhere Scottoline or the publisher would have given a Nod to Laura."
2,The longest holiday weekend EVER,"This book was simply OK -- entertaining if you didn't give it too much thought as you sailed through it. For example, nearly the ENTIRE STORY takes place over 4th of July weekend in Philly. After each wacky or scary incident, after each plot twist, I'd say to myself, ""And amazingly, it's still not Tuesday yet!""The story itself is derivative (anyone ever see the movie Laura?) but the path Scottoline takes to get us to the resolution was enjoyable enough. The characters were fun, if sometimes a little too cute. In short, it was like a candy bar from the vending machine -- fun while it lasted, but nothing you'll remember after you're done."
1,Sadly decieved,"I saw the original film in a theater. Can still recall the emotional impact of the sounds and the images. For years Amazon advertised only an Australian format cassette, and so I was delighted when I saw that it was finally available in DVD format. I so looked forward to seeing and hearing the great film on my HD 36"" TV. No such luck. This is a total fraud. The advertising should have indicated that it was merely a mechanical transfer that could properly be seen only in the oldest TV format. The whole job was done in a cursory fashion. The subtitles have strange spellings. The sound is not all that great either. A shameful product. Five stars for the film, none at all for this DVD."
2,"The Movie is Fantastic, however the DVD seems to be Korean Bootleg","I love this movie and have been waiting for years for a DVD of it. The VHS was available for a while for about $90, but I held off as I wanted to have a high quality copy. Unfortunately this DVD seems to be counterfeit and created from the VHS tape, and most descriptions on the cover are in Korean. I had my suspicion the moment I saw the cover, and then the print on the DVD disk itself. And then when I saw the movie, it became fully clear to me that I was right. Where regular DVDs sell for 19.99, I paid $28 for this. I am afraid that I have to keep this one, as I don't think any other copy was ever made by the producers. By the way, this movie is supposed to come with 3 sub-titles, including English, but the only the Korean one works. So it is your choice."
2,Suitable for cold fires,"You know, preferably the type that doesn't burn. Took this product up to the Boundary Waters; it fits nicely into a Army pack/duluth pack and functions to give the pack a flat back.But after a day of use, the griddle began to warp badly and was covered with a black soot that made everything else dirty. The non-stick wasn't really non-stick, as the first thing I cooked on it ruined the surface. To be fair, the product description says campfire coals, but to keep it hot enough, we had to go a fire going. The pan was placed on two rocks about six inches from the ground.I threw it away as soon as I got home. I'll be looking for an alternative next year, and wouldn't recommend this unless you're in a very controlled cooking environment."
1,Color transfer,"We purchased a large 6x9 red rug for our living room/kid's play area. It looked very nice and thick, but our hands were immediately red after unpacking it. The dye would transfer to socks, clothes and the floor and we therefore decided to return it. The seller informed us that this does not seem to be a problem with other colors, but maybe a bit more quality control with this particular color is needed before shipping them. We will continue to look for a new rug..."
4,Beware of matching Prairie rugs!,"I ordered the gold runner a month ago, was happy and decided to added a 2x3 gold for the same room. To my surprise the two shades of gold don't at all match! The runner was a lighter gold, but the 2x3 turned out to be decidedly darker and browner. Apparently there's a ""no return policy"" on this item! I'm shocked. Both rugs are good quality, but a buyer should know that there's no guarantee shades will match. Now I'm stuck with a nice little rug that I'll have to find another use for."
3,below expectations,"Honestly, having read from this author before I was expecting something a bit more engaging or deep? Anyway, still big fan of the author though. This copy was more used than I thought it would be. Very good price."
2,Not Very Flexible,Have not used this much. The legs do move but they do not like to stay where you move them.
5,breathtaking tour de force,"Tim Powers is a marvellous author. This time his imagination takes you on a time-travelling trip. True, it has been done before. Just not like this. Tim Powers makes it real. The research he has done for this novel probably even has some historians starting to believe in the possibility.The Anubis Gates is not just a fantasy novel. It's pure adventure. And much more. It's part literature, the way the author is using his language skills, part fantasy, part comical roller coaster ride. I never put the book down. Not even after my third time. You won't either."
2,We Could Have Done Without the Werewolves,"Tim Powers is a writer of considerable ability who lacks sufficient discipline. This novel has everything in it but the kitchen sink. The flashbacks and flashforwards are okay, but when the werewolves came in to an already rather complicated tale of Egyptians/Gypsies/London pickpockets/wacky American scientists/English professors I sort of lost interest. The best part of the book by far is the fragment at the beginning by William Ashbless, ""The Twelve Hours of the Night"", which is excellent. I think Powers should switch to poetry and drop his prose career."
2,This book is greatly overrated,"This novel is just one or two rungs above ususal low-level fantasy stuff. Supposed to be wonderful but definitely not. Quite imaginative but undescriminating and with oh-no-not-again slugs of action too much like a movie, and with the author being an English teacher he ought to know better -- supposed to be very ""well researched"" but not really, it reads like it was writen by a bloke who writes for a hobby and has a dead shaky understanding of the setting in terms of language, politics, culture, etc. Nor can he bring characters to life or make people or situations attractive so he just throws in more distr-action. Not a fan. Wouldn't read any more of his."
4,good but short,"I was expecting this anime to be a little longer then it actually was, but in saying that I was glued to it untill i had finished it. I was a little disapointed with the ending because I was expecting something else. i really wish they showed more of the story. All in all, it was a very good anime with a great story and great animation."
3,It's a good book.,"Is about Indigo Casson, and has suffered from mononucleosis and has already been in the hospital for three weeks. Then eventually he gets better,and figures out it's Monday. At school, he gets picked on by this boy and his gang. His little sister, Rose Casson, knows what's going on, and the red haired-gang leader doesn't want anyone to know. Then one day, they pick on Indigo's little sister Rose. Indigo gets real mad and takes matters into his own hands and beats up the kid and nor him or his gang pick on him or Rose again."
5,Great,Whats a Woman Woman is a terrific album and just like all Vaya Con Dios albums as good as they always are
5,Awesome!,"I bought this used, and the box does have cracks in it. But it did come in the original box, with the booklet. And the CD itself has no scratches or marks whatsoever. Every song plays without any skipping, and it's great quality. The price was AMAZING! And it shipped very quickly. I definitely recommend!"
2,Disappointing offering from a favorite...,"Fans of Elizabeth George will be disappointed in I, Richard. The quality of the short stories may not be George's best work, but they are an enjoyable read if you like either the approach or want to read everything written by a favorite author.What was very disappointing is that all of these stories have been published previously (one was slightly changed from the original version), but this is not noted anywhere in the book. This slim book appears to be not much more than an attempt to take advantage of unknowing buyers."
4,What gives?,"I don't understand all of the negative reviews for this book. It is what it is - a collection of dark, short-story mysteries. All of the stories are pretty good. I have enjoyed it. George is better at writing novels but this collection stands on it's own."
1,I Am Disappointed,"I'm an avid fan of Elizabeth George's novels so I thought I'd give her book of short stories a try. What a truly disappointing collection! The first story was off to a good start, but fizzled out in the end, and was wrapped up in a sloppy way. I wanted to throw down the book right then and there but I persevered. To my disappointment, every story in this book was ""lame"" , to use my teenager's terminology. I cannot believe I wasted my time!"
1,I am So glad that I didn't purchase this book!,"Thank goodness I got it from the library! I have read all of Elizabeth George's novels and this is about as different from any of the others as it can get. I didn't even finish a couple of the stories, as they were so boring. Please don't do this to us Elizabeth. According to all these reviews, your readers do not want more of this."
2,PRETTY SAD,I'm glad I waited until it was on TV.It wasn't the dead that stunk - it was the whole movie!
1,Awful,"We made it to chapter IV and couldn't take it anymore. This movie is slow, tedious, boring, and definitely one of the worst zombie movie I've seen yet. I love zombie movies, but this one is pretty awful. I'm really surprised that it had a 3-star rating. That was the reason why we chose this movie over other zombie movies. Big mistake..."
4,A Zombie Movie With Heart,This movie is excellent. It felt more like a drama with a zombie backdrop. I became very involved with the characters and felt bad when one would meet their demise. Very good acting as well. I was very drawn into the story. This movie may define a new genera. Drama/Zombie...Drambie....Zomrama maybe? Definitely worth the rental or purchase.
4,Civil War Zombies- a perfect mix,"Nowadays, anyone with a camera is able to make their own movie. I was hesitant to buy this. Too may times I've bought a movie that I knew was not ""Gone With the Wind"", but didn't expect it to be a complete dog, either. If it's cheap and I'm entertained, then I'm satisfied. In this case, you could see some effort had gone into this movie. The actors weren't slumming. Costuming was pretty much dead-on for the period. Story dragged in some areas, but that's what the FF is for. The makeup was very effective. I would say if you're a Civil War buff like I am, and also like Zombies, give it a try."
3,Another mediocre zombie film,"The mixing of zombies and civil war era was what caught my interest in watching this. For a zombie movie lover its worth watching, but if your not a zombie freak don't waste your time."
1,Slow and boring,"This movie was not very fast paced or interesting. Maybe civil war buffs who also like zombies may find it interesting. The characters weren't particularly believable or likeable. Very slow paced, boring dialogue and scenes. Not recommended."
4,"Compact, Affordable, A great study aid for anyone","This Bible is perfect for anymore. Its compactness is outstanding. There are references right next to the Scriptures and also there is a concordance at the back, parables of Jesus Chirst and colorful maps too. The only drawback is the flimsiness of the pages. Because its so tiny, the pages are very think and might be proned to tearing easily ( although that has not happened to me as yet!). But Besides that, its a great value and perfect for all ages!"
4,Best bible I've had in over 10 years,love this bible..i have large hands and so so eye sight..it very big and the font is 14 16.
5,"This is the ""heavenly"" tarot, for spiritual growth.","If you want to do the inner work, these cards can help you to unite with the angelic presence within you to access guidance from realms of the heart. Kimberley has drawn wisdom from her own spiritual unfoldment and has mastered the understanding of healing the inner passages that allow deep connection to our eternal selves. This is by far, the most cohesive and timeless information available for our human development. I would invite all to see for themselves, by using the cards daily for inspiration and intuitive understanding of one's own direction.Mary Rose Lam"
5,Angel Blessings is amazing,"I start each day with Angel Blessings. The pictures are beautiful and the words are so beautifully written. If you believe in angels, then you should have Angel Blessings.CG"
4,"Bright and cheery, yet fully functional too.","Received this set for Christmas and haven't used them yet, but the product appears to be durable, nicely sized for camp use as I intend to use them, and the mesh bag is perfectly sized to hold all plates, bowls and cups along with the GSI Outdoors Lexan 16 Piece Cutlery Set as well.After we get through a few meals with these, I'll post an update."
3,German music for all generations,"This boxed set is very good, and covers german music from many era's. My vavorite however was the last cd that covered the 1980's German pop music. A good investment, very little umpa music here!"
1,To Small,I purchased this book and sadly returned it. The hardcover is tiny and printed on thin paper. Do not recommend to anyone with kids under 5.
3,Ending?,It's okay but I feel like the ending is abrupt. My son wanted me to read it to him twice and that is all so far. But i know that the Carle stuff is hit or miss on kids and i think my kid is a miss on all of them besides the very hungry caterpillar.
5,Surprisingly good read,"I picked this book up at one of those outlet mall bookshops thinking there really was nothing else, but what the hell I could spend the $5. With no expectations I started reading the book and could not put it down. A good escape from the 20something chic lit. Finally a hilarious book on relationships from a guy's point of view. I am so glad I paid the $5 and would pay more if I could find another book that resembles this one in truth and wit."
1,"OK book, but lacking in content","The title of this book should be ""Windows PC Hacks"" since 99% of the hacks are Windows based. If you no longer use Microsoft products (like me), this is not a very good book for you.If you are no longer new to PCs and want to know a little more about the inner workings of your PC, you will probably enjoy this book.If you've built several PCs already, you already know 90% of what's in this book and won't care about the other 10%."
2,2 stars is generous,"A live Asia concert broadcast in 12/1983 on MTV and radio in which Greg Lake flat-out couldn't replace John Wetton. This is an old CD, of a big show ... but these 3 to 4 star ratings are ridiculous. People {ELP fans}, on this CD can you not hear on the end chorus of ""Wildest Dreams"" Lake sounds like he's in a state of severe constipation? Forget music transfer or sound quality issues ... this ISN'T Asia. And the management and everybody tried to pull it off as if it was, at the time. The concert itself and the build up, up to it was one of the biggest scams the American music business had ever perpetrated on the public, particularly the people of Tokyo, who loved the band Asia so much they took it in whatever form they could get it. The last release, ASIA Fanstasia: Live in Tokyo ... is the 'real deal', has John Wetton at the microphone and on bass. (Btw I am a big fan of Greg Lake, and have his double CD Retrospective)"
2,A Great Lost Opportunity!,"In 1983 the tension between Steve Howe and John Wetton, ended when the bassist was sacked from the band. He was replaced by Greg Lake(Still in Top Form!) to play a MTV's show for Japanese Television. This short lived incarnation of Asia: Howe,Wetton,Downes and Lake, played one gig only and short after Lake leave the band because ""it was too poppy for him"".This Tokyo's gig was released on Video as ""Asia in Asia "" , and here for the first time is release on CD format. Sadly the shine quality of the performance (Showing the versatility of Lake's voice to sing a Wetton's songs) is obscured by a poor quality recording adding the almost inexistent information in the record's booklet. It is a lost great opportunity to make a descent job on one of the most interesting piece of Asia's history.P.D I wrote this review twelve years ago under a key user that I forgot"
2,Save Your Money!,"This disc is essentially a watered-down version of the MTV ""Asia-in-Asia"" event (from the December 1983 concert) featuring Greg Lake on vocals.The performance is sorely lacking intensity...with Lake's weak vocals and the music unsettling to his range.However, contrary to popular belief, Asia performed two shows with Lake during this brief tour of Japan.Search the internet for a copy of the second show at the Budokan...the sound quality is vastly superior to this disc."
3,"Finally! ""ASIA In Asia"" makes it to CD","Seventeen years after it first debuted on home video, the band's much-bootlegged MTV ""ASIA In Asia"" concert gets a proper CD release. Purists will miss John Wetton's sterling vocals, but Greg Lake makes the best of his temporary role. Some songs were shortened to fit the alloted TV time, but what's here is quite good. Song selection is a mix of tracks from ""Asia"" and ""Alpha."" Those who don't mind Lake's stylistic differences will find this to be a nice document of the almost-original lineup."
2,Taino history,"This book is quite outdated. It still seem to think that Tainos became extinct. After testing the DNA of hundreds of Puerto Ricans, it was discovered that the reports of extinction were highly (very) exagerated. Not a surprise for those of us who knew better. Still there is some information that is still valid, just don't swear by it."
4,"Yadah, Yadah!","The second in L'engle's time series. This fast paced story brings together several characters to help Meg & Calvin save the farondolae, and forces Meg to see Mr. Jenkins, the school principal, as a human like herself. I really enjoyed this one, but once the action moves to Yadah, it gets a bit hard to follow, like reading through seawater. Charles Wallace and Calvin have critical, but reduced roles. I missed them a bit, but Proginoskes provides plenty of support for Meg"
5,As good as A Wrinkle in Time and that is saying a mothful.,"If you read a wrinkle in time, you already love these characters. But if you think you know all there is to know about them you are WRONG. This is a worthy companion to A Wrinkle in Time and that is about the biggest complimant I can pay to a book. Please read this book, if only to excercise your imagination"
5,A wind in the door,It was great and very descriptive and I loved how it was really make believe but yet seemed so realistic at the same time!!!It was really awesome!!!!! I suggest reading the whole series to everyone who has interest in science and fictional text.
4,"great book, highly recommended","A Wind in the DoorThe second book of Madeleine L'Engle's time Quintet series A Wind in the Door, was amazing. From the emotional part of six year old Charles Wallace Murry getting sick with a unusual disease that comes within him, to the exciting adventures of Meg Murry, Calvin O'Keefe and some unexpected friends to cure little Charles Wallace. I recommend A Wind in the Door to others because I loved how the book was so descriptive. For example, as a reader throughout the book, I felt as though I was one of the main characters, Meg Murry. The first book was mind-blowing, the second was wonderful, and I can't wait to read the third book A Swiftly Tilting Planet."
3,"Just, don't.",Not even a shadow of 'A Wrinkle in Time'. L'Engle seems to have used up all her firepower there. Meg's incessant whining irritated me to no end.
4,Not as good as A Wrinkle in Time,"The point of the story is good, but it is way too complicated. There are way too many big scientific words for the average child."
2,Too Detailed,"Have read some of her books and this was not as good as her others that I have read. It was too detailed and she repeated herself too much as far as going into her job in the surgery theatre. Could have had a little more romance in it. When I read a romance, I like more ""Romance"" in it. Just dropped you at the end where she could have continued a little at least. Broke the news to family and had them get married."
5,Daughter loves this mat,My little girl loves this hopscotch mat. She's 4 and it was very easy for her to assemble by herself. She has had it for a year and it's held up nicely under the weight of kids and adults playing. She loves hopscotch so I got it so she could still enjoy inside when the weather isn't favorable for outside play. The mat is brightly colored and the box is great storage and has a neat carrying handle.
1,Too many words to say too little,"The books is selling Amy Weintraub and her yoga career, not really teaching how to overcome depression through yoga. The book was too long and said too little of use. Would have been better to cut the book to about 1/3 the length and then maybe more people would read through it.The best line I got out of the book was to remind yoga pracatitioners that yoga is not enough; free weights, stationary bikes, treadmills, etc are still needed to stay in good condition. Yoga is relaxation and breathwork. The book was boring."
5,"Rockport ""B-Grade"" East Coast Slides",My husband loves these shoes. He said they are extremely comfortable. I like them because they look nice enough to wear out to dinner and casual enough for doing anything else.
3,class book,used this book for class. Nothing too special. would be nice for those seeking more on the bible though. not my deep dive
2,This is the worst one in leap frog as I know so far,"I like all other lepfrog leaning DVD, but this one made my 4 years old boy get bored so quick. I thought it would be like a movie connected by single story, but all the words are separated to many little story which made movie very boring. My boy likes all other leap frog leaning DVD. I am so disappointed with this."
5,my toddler loves it,"My 2-1/2 year old just loves the Sing and Learn with Us! DVD. The songs, that teach short vowel sounds, are groovy enough and short enough to keep her attention and she loves to dance along. She is even starting to pick up some simple spelling from the cute monster characters sounding out three-letter words and simultaneously holding up letter signs.As mentioned in other reviews, Tad, Leap, and Lily are nowhere to be found in this DVD. Also, the animation is cute but is not the traditional style of the other LeapFrog offerings. Still, my daughter loves this DVD and it is an effective learning tool."
1,Ho-hum,"I am afraid I expected more from this noir because I admired Vincent Price in such films as ""Laura"" and ""House of Wax"" as well as the British horror films with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. However, this is a rather lackluster, predictable film that appears to bore even its participants. If you have insomnia, this should have a soporific effect that will cure it."
5,Great Message,"This is a great book to use when trying to teach your children that God isn't finished with them yet. For a caterpillar surrounded by beauty, Hermie feels like he is not good enough. God continues to tell him He is not done yet. Eventually Hermie learns that he is very special and that God has big plans for him. Great and fun read for Christian families!"
1,FALSE ADVERTISING!,"This product is being advertised falsely! The image for the keyboard protector shows the keyboard on my three year old MBP but as other reviewers pointed out, it just clearly wasn't made for this keyboard. This is most likely a product for the newer MBP and would be a great deal for anyone with that computer, but I can't see the cost as any consolation for the fact that it just doesn't fit my keys! If a keyboard protector doesn't fit snugly, it doesn't do its job, period. Look elsewhere if you have the keyboard shown in the photo above."
3,It's ok,It works well but doesn't stay in place as I type. It would've been better if the surface that touches the keys had a surface that kept it in place while typing.
5,10 Stars,I first read this book twenty years ago after leaving the Marine Corps and I must say I could not put it down. It was a public library book and as I recall was about as big as War and Peace. This must be a reprint because the original was hard to find and very expensive. An excellent book. I cannot say enough if you have ANY interest in war books this MUST BE ON YOUR SHORT LIST!
3,Good Read,Good book. Interesting premise. Not sure if it's based on fact or not but still a rousing tale of the early days of conflict in Indochina.
2,"read chapter 9, forget the rest","Not at all what was expected. Over half of this work is spent convincing the reader that for a community to successfully raise its children, it should have a youth charter. This could have been accomplished on the book jacket, as chances are Damon's audience here is already convinced of this from other reading, and looking for the _how_, not the _why_ of having a youth charter.Unfortunately, only a few thousand words enlighten the reader as to how to effect this change in his own community. The first few chapters, an overexaggerated collection of _fictional_ before and after vignettes, are presented with excruciating, nearly condescending simple-mindedness.The chapters of interest are toward the end, (past 9) advising community leaders how to improve their town. If only the whole work could do the same. This one's a library reader."
3,Focuses on profit analysis,"I've read the 2001 edition, and I must say the title is rather misleading. (1) The coverage is not complete by any means. It focuses on rental houses, apartment houses, and land. Leaves out many other types, plus details on REITs, etc. (2) The book is about profit analysis. There's a chapter on negotiating and another on financing, but both are very short and not very enlightening. Instead, you are fed a lot of time-value math. This is actually good stuff, since as a RE investor you should be very clear about your profits and the impact of leverage and macro factors. I just wish the title accurately reflected the book's content."
2,Needs Stronger Production,"I would love to say that I enjoyed this solo release from Precise, but then I would be lying. And after careful thought I believe the reason for this is the production. To my ears it sounds very samey, with nothing distinctive to set any song out from the rest. Also Precise raps sound very mechanical and one paced. No doubt I'll be in the minority in my view of this CD, but so be it. With a better selection of beats, and more variety ,and energy to be his delivery, I feel that this could have been a better release."
2,Needs Work,"The song with Corey Redd is hot, he seems like he is mad at some pastors. To be real it's corny."
4,Repressed victorian woman self-actualizes with help from empathic psychiatrist,"By today's standard, Betty goes a bit over the top, but it is nevertheless, a good, albeit compressed version of changes of internalized self-objects. The still camera angles are certainly standard for this period piece, but the composition and costuming are superb. Davis is excellent and one can see her potential as she progresses into a movie icon. This should be in your library."
4,Good Stuff,"I like this tent. It's the first tent I've used since I lost my father's 80's era tent while moving. It's light, easy to set-up, and fairly spacious for two average sized people. The rain fly was a little complicated to put on the first time I used it, but then again it was 11 o'clock at night and I didn't have a light. I would recommend this tent, it's a good tent for a good price."
5,"Good, but still not what I'd like","The only problem that I've found with this item is the size listed in the product details. The details state that the item is 8.8 x 0.2 x 13.2, but it's more like 7 x 0.2 x 10.75, meaning it's 2 inches short of being wide enough to protect my entire laptop screen (my laptop is a 14"" Acer TimelineX).The mouse pad itself is great and if I could find a larger version on Amazon, I'd buy it. This items is great, so even though it's not the size I need, I give it 5 stars."
5,This thing is great!,"My 2 year old is a huge JoJo fan and receive this for her birthday. It's great! There is a volume control and an off switch in the back and it is easy for a 25 lb child to use. Some of the games are a bit advanced for her but she loves the JoJo says game and only needs a little help with it. And it can be tossed around, folded, and otherwise abused by a 2 year old without any malfunctions."
1,not what I expected,"I purchased this dance mat for my one year old son who is a huge JoJo fan. He has The Wiggles dance mat and just loves it. When he steps on The Wiggle dance mat, it actually plays The Wiggles songs. I rate this product only one star because it really isn't a dance mat. It doesn't play a single JoJo tune-just some brief instrumental generic children's songs. My son loves to hear JoJo music and since it doesn't play any, he had no interest in it! They should call it a game mat since that is what it mostly is. I returned it to Amazon!"
1,Don't get ripped off!,This is a single CD only 4 songs. Forget it. Buy their full CD and don't fall for this.
2,Time of Our Lives,This CD was disappointing to me. I guess I hadn't looked carefully enough before I ordered. The same song several times with slight differences is not my idea of something I want to listen to -- not even when sung mainly by Il Divo.
2,not worth the price,there were only a few selections on the CD. Not much in comparison to the others that I purchased. It should not have been as expensive in my opinion.
5,Dante's Peak/Daylight,Enjoyed both movies and the price. Movies came as a two pack...great value and entertainment.
2,Is it really Faberware?,"I suppose this tea pot works well enough but I am somewhat dissapointed. No where on the box does it say Faberware, I think this may be a knock off. It doesn't whistle very well at all because the whistle part does not sit against the teapot securely enough as the weight doesn't hold it against the teapot securely enough. It doesn't hold very much water either. If you try to put more water in it, the water bubbles out the top. All in all it works to boil water but it was not worth the money and as I said, I don't think it is a genuine Faberware product."
2,"Bad, has more of filler and stupid/unfunny jokes rather than the opposite of this.","While season 2 part 2 of ""Shin Chan"" has some funny moments, they are few and far between and most of the show consists of filler and stupid/unfunny jokes. Don't get me wrong ""Shin Chan"" is a good, funny anime but season 2 of it sucks ass. IF you wish to watch ""Shin Chan,"" watch season 1 of it instead. Skip this crap. 2.5/10"
4,Very good,"I liked this book alot. I couldn't put it down. When I first picked it up I didn't think it would be very good, the name sorta put me off. But it was very good and I hope Date writes another book soon."
5,The Essential Guide to The Chinese Garden,"Rarely do we have a Westerner who can explain the intricacies and beauty of the Chinese Garden, which certainly played an important role in the lives of the Emperors and Empresses, and the Chinese literati. Maggie Keswick, by virtue of her education in Shanghai and her travels in China, has written a unique and lovely book to explain the philosophy behind the Chinese Garden. She has both depth and width in a subject that is scholarly, yet explained so well that the ordinary reader can appreciate. Ancient Chinese gardens gave inspiration to bonsai and miniature landscape art as well as the Zen gardens of Japan. Keswick's use of pictures and stories make the book indeed fulfilling."
1,A pedantic diatribe of thoughtless conjecture.,I have no idea what this man is talking about. His approach to fatherhood is so archaic he makes the staunchest 1950s conservative look like a member of the anarchist liberation front. It's obvious Dr. Linton's writing stems from an attempt to justify his own shortcomings as a father. A dismal read even for the 50 cent bin at the used book store.
5,Needed this to increase my sources.,"What can I say? Good item, well researched, well written. Substantiates many existing theories and discoveries, giving a more profound basis."
2,not for fiction writers,"I wish the book information had mentioned this is for nonfiction books. I know some of the information is the same for both, but I also know a lot isn't. It may be good for nonfiction writers, I'm just disappointed I didn't find that out until reading the introduction after buying the book."
3,Felt Rather Incomplete...,"This is certainly a unique setting for a mystery novel. Harris puts his characters in a Germany that won WWII. Unfortunately, the book felt like only half of the story of the alternate history... it just ended on an unfinished note. It is this ""what if"" setting that really provides the focus of the entire book - without it, the underlying plot and characters were unremarkable, at best. The murder mystery was not particularly mysterious, and all the set-up ultimately felt rather wasted. It just seemed like only half of the novel... too many questions were left unanswered by the time the pages came to an end."
2,Empty,"As with most books, this has a novelty concept, that of a man living in a Nazi superstate had the power been semi-victorious in World War II (and, he carefully notes, it was only a few bad decisions away from being thus). The historical research is beautiful, but the characters are alarmingly obvious and the mystery, muddled, goes so much nowhere. The obvious comparison is to Orwell's ""1984,"" yet this is even more mundane; these characters make lip service to desiring freedom or democracy or whatever, but their actual motivation seems to be self-interest and the restless pursuit of a good life their neurotic minds will not allow them. Worthy for a historical read, boring as a mystery."
2,"Good thriller, but Orwell's work.","I couldn't put this book down.As a left-wing author (Harris was a BBC journalist)it seems obvious to me that he has re-written ""1984"", but with the political right being the baddies. So, I could only give two stars."
5,sparse but very good,"This is a very enjoyable, albeit highly disturbing spy thriller. There are enough twists and turns here to keep one reading into the night, and Harris is fully in control of this serpentine yet endlessly engaging narrative. Xavier March, the 'asocial,' is an exceedingly likeable hero. His ally, the American journalist Charlotte Maguire, is equally attractive. Their amusing banter and growing love for each other forms much of the heart and conscience of the story. What I truly admire about this book are the lack of fetishism with regards to SS behavior and paraphernalia, and the unthinkable, sickening probability of a victorious Third Reich. Thank God National Socialism in Germany was crushed."
5,"Chilling, alternate history . Nazis won, and it is 1964","-This very chiling and realistic book will haunt your perceptions for a long time. -Definitely worth the time for World War II buffs. -Berlin is the world's key city, and Nazi slogans, spies, fear, and totalitarian pomp and hubris define this society. All the rest are vassals. -Jews disappearing? Just a prefabricated myth!! -A perfect ""what if"" tale, starkly possible. -I now FEEL DIFFERENT seeing the new black VW Bug, ...whcih could be (in alternate history) a good market ploy of the modern Nazi society!"
2,hohum,The plot/story wasn't compelling. This is a _what if_ Germany won the war and we never knew what happened to the Jews. I found it too unbelievable that the world wouldn't have investigated the disappearance of the European Jewish population. A very slow read with an unsatisfing ending.
1,Worst ABRIDGMENT Ever,"Somehow they managed to abridge out all of the alternative history from this alternative history thriller. You'll never know anything about how the United States won the war against Japan and Germany won the war against Russia from listening to this abridgment. They took all of the history out and left a very uninteresting murder mystery. Oh, and Colonel Clink does a lousy job with the voices in his narration."
2,Despicable human beings,"Dumas' story does not age well. The musketeers live in an age when honor, nobility and dignity rules everything-- which turns them into absolutely horrific human beings. They treat their servants as property-- Porthos even forces his servant to take another, more ""adventurous"" name. They terrorize the common folk-- at one point, Athos destroys an innkeeper's entire stock of food because he blaims the owner for an unrelated assassination attempt. And they treat women terribly-- the main villainess, MiLady, is really only ""bad"" because she refuses D'Artagnan's lustful advances.The pacing is also about as fast as molasses rolling uphill in winter.The musketeers are supposed to be a classic of swashbuckling. But when you actually read their adventures, you find they're nothing more than arrogant, murderous sociopaths."
2,Comment,"I bought this mainly because of the DVD. Unfortunately, although the delivery address was NEW ZEALAND, when it arrived the DVD wasnt compatable with the local systems.....so it was useless.........the book was very brief..as previous reviews have stated....its the DVD thats the main part. Shame that as I was hoping to 'see' techniques etc....."
5,Blissful Journey is RIGHT!,"If you are looking for music to play in the background while you work, read or concentrate then this is a great cd - the music is very calming and peaceful and easy to listen to over and over again. If you're looking for music to play while you meditate or sit quietly and contemplate your being - your world - your place on this earth - this music is perfect for that as well. Blissful Journey is a perfect and wonderful title for it as that is exactly the image it provokes. You won't be disappointed in this cd."
4,Great for camping,"Great for camping. Bought it along with the hand grinder. Makes the best camp coffee ever. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the plunger is a little flimsy and plastic. Should have been all metal with a spring around it like a real glass press. This lets a bit of the grounds out around the edges. But still the best cup of coffee in camp I've been able to make, since I'm not about to bring the glass one out there."
3,GSI Outdoors French Press coffee maker,"I was expecting the french press as shown in the advertisement, but received a different version. The one that I received had a much cheaper plastic press, unlike my other GSI Glacier Outdoor which has a very sturdy all stainless wire/plate press. I was disappointed, although after three months, it hasn't broken...yet."
3,good ideas--but too long,"If you haven't read the editorial review or the book flap, which give away so much as to ruin much of the effect, it's an interesting, imaginative, and unusual read.However 375 pages milks the ideas for all they are worth, and makes the same points repeatedly, so that gradually I cared less and less about the outcome no matter how much the author attempted to keep the suspense going. I read to the end but the ending seemed to make no great difference. Seems it could be cut to maybe 200 pages...Recommended if you enjoy the surreal, satirical, allegorical, have an interest in spiritual subjects, and have some extra time...I would not however pay full price."
3,Once dead but now alive more than ever,"This is an excellant book about the meaning of life, and the encouragement to live a life to the fullest. I was not disappointed in the quality of the book; it's a fine read for those not already acquanted with ""life after life"" experiences. However, the title and Jacket suggest the book will be primarily about the dying and the immediate recovering experience. Instead, I found this book to be more of an evangelical inspiration book. If that's what the reader wants, this is a good one."
3,Not what I expected!,"I was expecting the book to be more about his after death experience,in Heaven. It was all about him, during his recovery. He had a horrible time and I feel really bad about that, but at the same time, readers are led to believe that you would be reading all about Heaven, what he saw and heard. Not much at all about that. His story was interesting,which is why I gave 3 stars."
2,Not what I expected,"I'm about halfway through the book and so far only brief mention of the NDE with no details. This book seems to be mostly about a pastor's experience ending up in the hospital and his recovery. I am a bit put off by the authors constant ""humbling"" experiences of learning how much he is loved by everyone. At one point he describes (at too much length) his first public speech after his illness at a place referred to as ""Gardens""... he humbly points out that the ""Gardens appearance"" is not to be confused with Jesus' ultimate Garden appearance. Glad he made that clear. I was expecting an NDE story but this isn't it. I don't intend to finish the book so in all fairness maybe he does get to the NDE eventually, maybe he also gets to the ultimate Garden experience like Jesus' too..."
5,Juke joint inspired!!,"I'm inspired to go find a juke joint in the Deep South after listening to this CD. To me it is reminiscent of the blues that is played there. This music is what we Southerners call ""down home blues.""Cray reminds me of a young B.B. King and in this CD he covers everything from ""he can't wait to see his baby"" to ""he's losing his baby."" Those are tracks one and two respectively and it only gets better. This man can make a guitar talk as well as any blues musician, and the fact that he can make you feel his joy and pain doesn't hurt either. On this CD you can definitely feel his southern roots. I recommend it as muse music, heck I just plain recommend it."
4,The right direction,"This album is exactly right where ""Ol' Bob"" should be. His main detractors are annoyed that RC isn't doing hard-edged blues anymore. Where have they been? Except for the Grammy winning Showdown, RC's only blues album was his first (a nice new remaster available) and even that one had inklings of what was to come.Robert Cray has taken alot of flak over the years for not being a tradionalist, unfortunate because Strong Persuader was responsible for bringing blues back into the American mainstream in the mid 80's.Robert's not solely a blues man and anyone who listens will learn this. While his guitar playing is clearly steeped in the blues greats, He is strongly influenced by the driving rhythms of 60s Stax material (Otis Redding, Johnnie Taylor) and Shoulda Been Home exemplifies this more than any other of his albums.If you like RC don't listen to that traditionalist and pick up this album. As far as I'm concerned this is The Blues and then some."
5,Great Album! Excellent cross-over blues/rock...,"I love Robert Cray - but this album is something new. He has an energy and sound that really moves, and I like the changes. Old Cray fans may not agree, but we love it. If you like Keb Mo and some of the newer blues, you will love this album!"
2,Lost half my digital TV channels.,"I live about 30 miles away from NYC and use OTA broadcast. I have a big antenna in my attic for the last 20 years. Anyway, I was planning to move my TV to the other side of the room and needed a long cable. So I connect this cable from the splitter to a 36db amplifier. Before, I had 41 digital channels. After I put this cable in, I now have 24 digital channels. From the antenna plus this 50 feet cable, there is 75 feet of cable. With my original cable from the splitter to the amplifier, it was 6 feet long, a total of 31 feet of cable. I don't know if its the cable or maybe I need something stronger to boost the TV signals. So I guess I can't rearrange my room for now until I figure what to do."
2,Stay away from this product!,"I bought this product from Shooter's Ridge. Stay away from this product because it does not come pre-filled as advertised. I have not been able to use this product yet because I haven't had the time to fill it. First, I have to figure out what to fill it with. Once this is determined (I live in Minnesota with a blanket of snow), then I have to spend considerable time filling it. Don't buy this product."
2,Great musicianship but no continuity,"It would be hard to fault the bands' abilities, but the music left me very cold. If you are looking for great chops with fine composition, pick up Al DiMeola's latest album, ""The Infinite Desire"". If your looking for great fusion get Larry Coryell's ""Cause and Effect"". DiMeola and Coryell are doin' it to it (sorry John, nothing personal)."
2,Overated work of Chow,"Dare no one criticize the ""king of comedy"" stephen Chow or, OK, most of you westerners may have a different taste.From the point of view of a Hong Kong born native speaker of cantonese, I have no choice but to say that Shaolin Soccer was overrated. SC's hilarious jokes went stale and he was too obssesed with the use of special effect too. This movie makes me miss his past works like ""from beijin with love"", etc so much.another point is that, SC are now more concern of the market of the rest of Asia and even Western, he eliminates all jokes which only locals find funny. So to me, as a Hong Kong people, I am disappointed."
1,Why bother????,"This movie is so bad I don't have the slightest idea why so many people are giving it 5 stars. The jokes are outdated and EXTREMLY corny. So um on the reality scale it gets 0 out of 100000000000000000000000. A normal guy kicks the ball and tries to score the goalie is scared out of his little brain......goalkeepers shouldn't be afraid of the ball they need to protect it not to get scared. Anyway when he 'tries' to block it by standing there like a idiot it hits him i wonder why and it blows all his clothes off hahahaha funny....not. In the circumstances where they do their jokes it is entirely unappropriate. Yeh, movies can go out the real world a little but this is crazy. Unless you are a 40 person who lives with their mother, you have no reason to be seeing this."
3,Not so great,Its not in english didn't read that it was English subtitles only. Its a great movie but without subtitles even better.
5,Perfect blend of Kung Fu and Comedy,"I know that Stephen Chow has a large body of work but being an American this was the first film I got to see. I couldn't have been blown away more. I liken it to movies like Groundhog Day or even Office Space, you didn't think they would be as good as they were. This movie is really fun and it sucks you in. Personally I like this better than Kung Fu Hustle the concept itself is more interesting and the outrageous characters seem more down to earth."
4,"Great movie, but no spanish subtitles","The movie on the back saids that has spanish subtitles, I brough it for my g/f, because she doesn't understand english subs. that much. On the settings menu, theres only english & NO spanish what so ever, thats the ONLY negative detail I have to say."
4,"Silly, Funny, Gross but good with some cool action sequences","After reading reviews about this film and missing the chance to see it on the big screen, I was finally able to rent this and was not disappointed. This film does not take itself seriosly and neither should the viewer. Lots of scenes that will make you go ""what the...?"" Particularly involving the one shaolin brother who loves eating too much and the egg that is used to help his soccer training. Loved it and will see it again!"
4,"So funny, why didn't anyone think of this before?","I enjoyed Stephen Chow's fun treatment of Soccer + Kung Fu. It's reminiscent of the slapstick comedy of Airplane. It's just plain funny.I am not a fan of Jackie Chan. Never have been. So if my martial arts comedy standards may be a bit different from yours. After watching Chan's last movie The Forbidden Kingdom I can safely say I never will watch him willingly again. I relented to watch after a 15 year fast from his last movie and was immediately sorry I had gone back on my word.Shaolin Soccer's Stephen Chow has been able to marry kung-fu and comedy that doesn't make you wince like Jackie Chan. Shaolin Soccer is has a great story line. It is witty and fast moving. OK, not the best martial arts I've ever seen but in the context of a comedy that had a good storyline this was unique and made me laugh. Mission accomplished."
3,A realistic attempt,"Is Raat Ki Subah Nahin, as the name goes, is a stark, realistic look at life in urban Bombay. Life whizzes past you, fast and before you know it you are in the middle of murder, mayhem, violence and attempted suicide. The pace of the movie is slick, the tale told refreshingly. The team of actors and actresses make a sincere attempt at portraying the sleaze, muck and grime that even the layman might get involved in by just being a part of the real Bombay. The Bombay of locals, of the underworld, of slums, of overpopulation, of crime and of survival amidst all this that constantly bogs you down. Good triumphs over evil, even in this dark city of terror, finally."
5,Polka Palace,"We love the Backyardigans. This DVD has 2 of our most favorite episodes. The songs are very contagious, even to my husband!"
5,Great music!,Love both episodes on this video. The tea party is great and is much more entertaining than you might think - to me and my son!!
5,Excellent quality!,Fits perfectly the only problem is that if you want to use headphones you have to open the cover a bit because the hole for headphones does not fit but that is not a big deal for me.
3,The Best Latin Songs Ever...kinda,"Here is my beef with this book....most of the songs have been translated into English. That would be fine if the original Spanish or Portugese were included along side it, but most of the time they are not. It is only logical that most people with an interest in Latin music would want to have the original language of the songs at least available to them. ... So if you are interested in this book...take note...the description of the book is incomplete...these are Latin melodies with English translations! If that is what you are looking for, the book is probably a good choice for you, as it is otherwise of good quality."
5,Love this show.,Excellent show and great and timely arrival to my x wife...product was new and arrived perfectly packed. Great product and service.
4,welcome back Fran,Funny and upbeat. It is great to see Fran Dresher back on television. It is time that we have another gay postive situation on TV.
5,Love this show!,"I ordered this Happily Divorced season 1 DVD set because I had missed a few episodes on TV and I wanted to catch up on them. Hilarious show, can't wait for the second season to come out!"
3,Ted's final tour,Took me two listenings to get into this cd that a friend reccomended. Now I can't get it out of my head. Good late nite traveling music.
2,disappointed,"I'm not sure what this is supposed to be, but there is nothing new here. Even the tital doesn't fit the material. The only thing on the dvd are 9 live songs and two are repeats. Although I love all the songs and its nice to see them sung live, there are no videos of her singing when she was little and no songs that havn't been released. All it has is ""No Me Queda Mas"", ""Si Una Vez"", ""No Debes Jugar"", ""Baila Esta Cumbia"", ""Amor Prohibido"", ""Bidi Bidi Bom Bom"", ""La Carcacha"", ""La Llamada"", and ""Como La Flor"". ""Baila Esta Cumbia"" and ""Como La Flor"" are repeats. I feel very ripped off and pissed that they gave the impression that we would be seeing something new. Buy at you own risk."
1,This video sucks!!!!,"It shouldnt be called through the years, it should be called the last 2 years (only performances). There is only like 3 different scenes with only 11 songs and two of the songs are repeated. It does not talk about selena as a child or show pictures of her growing up like it indicates with the pictures on the cover. They are nice performances but no where near ""through the years"". If you are looking for a DVD of selena's life this in far far far from it. Im so dissapointed with it."
4,Good Book Illustrator CS for Dummies,"I have found that this book is a great place for a beginner or someone trying to improve on their graphic abilities to start. This book can be a very good tool to help review and remind you of some thing that my have slipped your mind. If you need to rate this book on the 5 star scale then I would give it a 4 &#65533;. The reason it fails for the full 5 stars is that it only had a few full color pages(16) and in some small areas, it is hard to find some things it asked you to process. You have to changed a few things (setup view), then they are where they say they are. One more little bit of info, if you are looking to buy this software and use this book, buy the book only and download the try me version of the ""Illustrator CS"". This way if you don't like the software then your only out the cost of the book.Wil BaileyLaGrange, GAWGCFUG.org"
2,Worst Dummies book I've encountered,"I can pretty much learn programs during a weekend. I did learn some things via this book, but not as much as I need to get started. I was shocked to see that they actually define the word ""font""...and discuss some really basic things. Someone starting Word might need this help, but give me a break -- if you buy Illustrator you probably already know! I was also shocked at how few visual examples they give. For a graphics program, I would give as many as I can. Finally, I would include a step-by-step creation of an Illustrator page -- gets the user to learn hands on."
4,size,"wanting to by this, but needing some one to tell me what size the greenhouse is,love the looks and what ever size it is."
2,"""You get what you pay for""","I knew when I bought it that it was only $88.00 so as the old saying goes ""you get what you pay for"". It was easy to construct, the frame was ok. the covering is what was horrible. First when I opened the package you could see where one of the seams had not been sewed together.After using it for two weeks one side of the front zipper broke and would not secure the front flap any longer. Basically after using it for this growing season the covering will have to be thrown away, for the two weeks it worked I did get my seeds to sow and grow. Unfortunately for the next two weeks I'll just have to figure away to keep the front flap closed until it's warm enough to plant outside. I must say even though I did not pay a lot I'm still disappointed that the covering failed the way it did."
3,broken from the start,I would have liked this greenhouse a lot if one of the zippers hadn't been broken (missing several inches of teeth)in the box. Unfortunately we didn't find this out until it was completely set up and since a cold spell had arrived we didn't dare take it down and risk frosting the tender plants. So we have not sent it back. The zipper is broken near the top of the structure so one side of the door is completely gaping!Otherwise I think I would have liked this product very much.
3,We'll see how it goes,"The pros are it is fairly easy to set up and relatively modest in size. The cons are the support structure, the beams are light and it's prone to being blown away. I just set this up a few days ago; next morning the whole tent was blown to the side. The ground stakes can be used only if this greenhouse is set in soil. We have concrete in our backyard. We have to wait and see how it goes."
2,I don't believe it,"I don't know how much of this book was written by Mr. Puzo and how much by Carol Gino, but definitely was not the style of Mr. Puzo, the book tells us the story of the Borgia family, but consider that family as a mafia family like Omerta or the Last Don, I really don't think so, if you read it as as history book may be you will like it (if is true what is written in the book, because it is impossible to know what a person thinks, you will understand this if you read the book), but is not a thriller, it won't invite you to read it unless you want to know the end of the story.At the end of the book, is just that, but of course if it is a true story and that is his end you can't do anything."
1,Horribly Disappointing,"This book had the makings of something special. The Borgias are an original mob family. Instead of owning a territory or even a city...they owned nations and religions. In the hands of Puzo? WOW!I don't know at which point Puzo stopped writing and Carol Gino picked up. I can only guess that Puzo didn't get very far and/or the editors made a terrible mess of what was left. The story has absolutely no depth, and the characters have even less. The story, if one can call this narrative a 'story', is more of an outline than anything else I can describe. One can almost imagine the bullet points preceding each paragraph. I desperately wanted the early overview chapters to be a foundation upon which a masterful ""Godfather""-like story would rest.Instead, I became desperate to put the book down. And so I did.Quite simply, this book is unreadable."
3,"Not by any means the equal to ""The Godfather.""","Although ""The Family"" is worth reading for its depiction of historical events that took place during the late 15th century, with cameos by esteemed philosopher Machiavelli, Renaissance man Leonardo da Vinci, and painter Michelangelo, it is poorly written. Which comes as an unexpected shock since the late Mario Puzo has gained a reputation for penning some of the greatest literature that has ever been written. The characters lack personality, are one-dimensional, and wooden. The dialogue seems contrived and without much emotion. ""The Family"" fails to invoke feelings for each character and seems to place historical accuracy above the author's propensity for sketching memorable characters that the reader can identify with. This flaw in most cases could be overlooked, but not in an author who has contributed so much to the world's literature.A must read for anyone who have found the Borgia and Medici families, as well as the Renaissance of interest."
1,Disappointed!!!,"I wouldn't recommend this product. It is poorly edited and produced.It safe to say that it is a patch of bits and pieces with no depth.If you are simply interested on watching nuclear explosion, then thismight be something to consider. For the earlier history of the subject,I would recommend ""The Moment in Time: The Manhattan Project"" andyou don't have to pay a dime for it. You can watch it on the net."
1,Leaks,I have a badger 5 and it developed a crack. I did some research and found lots of people with this problem. Stay away from this product
1,Broken in 4 years,The plastic case for the disposal broke where the drain attaches. It lasted 4 years of intermittent use. I would not recommend this product--it is poor quality.
1,Housing has cracks after one year of use.,"After one year of use, the housing now has developed several cracks and is leaking. DO NOT GET THIS MODEL."
1,"Good Customer service, Terrible product",The product was shipped on time and looked to be in great shape. BOY WAS I WRONG. Once the disposal was installed it would only hum but not turn. I tried everything to get it to work before calling the company. They instructed me to hit the reset button. Like I had not tried this already. After a few days the company finally gave me a reference code for a handy man. The handy man came out and said the bearing was damaged in it and they would replace it for free. Now I am just waiting for another one to come in and hopefully it will work.
1,COMPLETE GARBAGE,"I cannot understand how the folks who made this thing could have attached their names to it. The acting is bad, the story is ridiculous, the special effects primitive, the sets primitive. it is, bar none, one of the wost films I have wasted time on in years. (I fast forwarded through most of it just to see if any part was worthwhile.) No luck."
2,A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN,Save the money...Mediocre performances and graphics...go watch AIR FORCE ONE...literally the same thing. Not worth $25 bucks.
4,I love the Gourmet Kitchen!,"This kitchen it great! It has plenty of space for all of your cooking gear, plates, stove, etc. I love the shelf underneath the sinks as it gives so much more room on the top for food preparation. I did bring my own cutting boards as I didn't want to scratch up the ones that come with the kitchen. The pressurized water system is great, but it has one flaw. When you pump up the water bag (with the foot pump), the water continues to flow even after you stop as there is no shut off valve for the fauacet. I simply went to the hardware store and got one of those sprayers which most sinks have. It has its own shut off lever, so I can pump it up and just release the water when I need it. It's easy for my 4 and 7 year old to use, too. I can't wait to use it again."
4,pretty sharp,decided to purchase this lens as an all rounder. im pretty impressed. auto focus can be off and somewhat slow at times but overall im pleased. seems to hunt around a bit but 90% of the time it focuses and its accurate and can produce very sharp images. i have gotten use to manual focusing this lens with ease. i am glad i purchased this lens. macro option between 200-300 is a bonus..
3,about this lens question please,I just would like to know if this lens will work with my nikon d 3000 Cant seem to find someone to ask thanks for anyone who knows
4,"For the price, very pleased","I'm a professional wedding/portrait photographer, but bought this lens for lightweight backpacking trips. (I cannot allow myself to just bring a point and shoot!)The construction seems fine, although when in manual-focus mode the switch is sometimes fickle about being moved back to autofocus. Figured out it was my method, but it's not the most straight-forward design.I'm satisfied with the image quality for the price.[...]"
4,This lens take incredibly sharp vibrant pictures,"This lens is incredible. Regardless of price, this lens takes beautiful pictures. When you look at the price it is just that much more impressive. I'd heartily recommend this lens to any beginning to advanced amateur photographer. Heck a pro could probably really put this lens to use, but there are too many other fantastic L series lenses out there for Pros to play with. For the rest of us, this is how we roll."
4,Excellent build quality. Limited without OS. Know the limitations and you will be thrilled.,"Great value, excellent build quality, a pleasure to use in good light. Outstanding in macro mode.This lens is an excellent example of a high quality product that Sigma is known for, delivered on a budget, and when used within its limitations delivers excellent results.Ran this lens for 6 months on my Nikon D60 without issue. Now that I have a D300S, this lens remains in my bag. No optical stabilization is a real limitation. You wont be happy with any picture taken with a shutter speed of less than 1/125.Feels great - the build quality is everywhere. Focus speed is good not great. The focus noise is there but not an issue.Portraits at 100mm look wonderful on this lens!Recommended!"
4,Very nice,"I really like this lens...i agree with almost everything oin the previous post, especially the part about the marco switch. That switch is the only real negative side to this lens. Don't know why it keeps getting stuck?! It always scares me when it happens.Overall a really nice lens though. Smooth and rather fast operation."
3,If its lacking something then...its color reproduction,I did not expect this lense to perform like nikon 70-300..But still still its a good lense for beginners..its hungry for light..so forget about low light shooting with this..low exposures with this lense is not as good as Nikons..but day light shooting is very good..sharp and clear..but somehow I feel the colors are not well reproduced..i took the same shot with same settings..and found Nikon the best in colors..so I am happy with its price but thinking of getting the nikon one..
3,Not a good experiance,"This is my first 70-300 mm range lens.I am using it for canon 350d camera.I will not say that its bad lens neither its perfect.It was the most reasnoable price lens in its range for me but I encountered few problems:- The autofocuse is very bad. Whenever I am trying to autofocus, it take very long time and in 80% it does get it correctly.- I don't know why but the photos sometimes appers pinky !!!.- Actually the lens was heavier than what I was expecting. When I bought it I didn't see anything regarding its weight but it came to be heavier than my expectation and I have some difficulties in keeping my hand still sometimes and the lens always driving the camera in downward direction antriorly.-Unfurtionatly one month after I bought it due to its heavy weight it was broken after fall down from low height."
2,Too much of a personal account -- there's better stuff out there,"Skip this book. No need to get into a very personal account of a man's personal awakening experience. I recommend books by authors such as Nathan Gill, Jeff Foster, John Wheeler, 'Sailor' Bob Adamson, Joan Tollifson. These books are clear and written to help you."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed when I recieved this book. It does contain a large amount of recipes and variations. However it seems more suited to a generation that knew nothing of nutrition and generally healthy eating. While I understand that not everything is 'cooking light' there seems to be zero consideration or mention of these modern day issues and concerns - no healthy alternatives seem to exist.My advice is to keep shopping there are a lot of good alternatives available that cover all aspects of the sauce subject.
5,"can,t go wrong with Tommy Bolin","Arrived promptly and in great condition. Excellent music to rock to, Great instumentals too!I would recommend to anyone who enjoys good rock music!"
4,Who makes music like this anymore?,"I really enjoy this record. Tommy's solo in ""Savannah Woman"" gets me every time and the title track is simply awesome (why did Motley Crue have to go and butcher it?). There really is a lot of variety here, unified by Bolin's distinctive guitar-playing and smooth vocals. But the ballads can drag a bit, particularly ""Dreamer"".This album was briefly available on cd domestically on the original Nemperor label (I bought that version back in 1987), so if you look hard you might be able to find it used somewhere and avoid the pricey import."
5,Timeless,"I first heard this album around 1983. Since then I have had the opportunity to listen to it as the years have gone by. Out of all my collection, this CD is in the top five because you can listen to it from year to year and it still sounds fresh.There is a timelessness around all the songs on this which is a testament to Tommy's songwriting ability. I remember playing ""Wild Dogs"" in a band and can still listen to it as it was just recorded and produced last month. Dreamer is such an underrated song and the rest of the album has so much diversity, it makes it a ""must have"" in anyone's collection.If you are an artist or performer or just have a love of great music, there is a lot to learn just by listening to this CD. Once again, a must have."
2,Overrated,"Less interesting than expected.Think of Ritchie, Jimmy, Jimi, Jeff, Santana a.o.The voice is kind of thin too..."
3,Love Hate,"It works wonderfully, I've only been using it a little while but I can already tell a difference. However it tastes absolutely horrible. I had to mix it with some pure honey -- still tastes bad but a little less so"
3,Burning Up!,"Whilst I don't, as such, own this CD, the first two tracks can be heard on Intergalactic Sonic 7""s and a live version of the latter is on the Tokyo Blitz DVD. If you own neither, it's worth shelling out a few dollars; not only was Burn Baby Burn voted single of the year by British Magazine Q, but the remaining tracks are also worthy of some credit: 13th Floor being one of the brash highlights from the underwhelming B-Side compilation 'Cosmic Debris', and the Weezer cover of 'Only in Dreams' taking things to a fresh finale. Tim looks ever so odd on the cover, but the video's quite tasty, regardless of what sex you are!"
4,lots of action for $4,"Well, my cat loved it. I bought it as a cheap item to get the amazon.com free shipping on another purchase. Cat went completely nuts. The base isn't very wide so it occasionally tips over. Has a bell attached, so I hide the toy at night so I can sleep. Mine has a blue ball on top."
1,Brass bolt fatigues and breaks,I'd give this zero stars if I could. I bought one of these recently. I didn't use it long though. The brass bolt fatigued and broke through the corner of the groove. I wonder if anyone else has had this problem. Should have paid the extra money for a good one....
5,Swanson 12-Inch Combo Square,"This is an excellent square at a great price. At first I was going to buy a Starrett but I really didn't want to pay that kind of money, so I went with this instead. It is dead on square! It also feels very durable and strong. I really like this square."
5,Blues at it's finest,"This is one of the finest collections of the blues I have heard. Well worth the money. From Mississippi Delta to Chicago, it's all here."
1,I wouldn't buy this book with YOUR money,"I guess you don't have to be intelligent to work for the New Yorker. Denby proves this as he is stupid beyond belief. I refuse to subsidize his stupidity. If you HAVE to read it, do yourself a favor and simply check it out from your local library. Wait for inter-library loan if you have to.Nuff said."
1,You are the sucker if you buy this book!,"The title of this book should be ""An American sucker if you buy this book"". This book is about nothing, a failed marriage without explanation and fail trades not explained. If you need to spend money to learn that Enron was full of crooks, then you are a sucker. Save your money people."
1,Turgid and badly organized,"I ordered this book hoping for an interesting, legible, treatment of Armenia, from pre-history to more recent times. If you're tempted to buy it, don't bother. The information presented is disorganized, superficial and not very coherent."
3,Expensive for Adequate,"The switch is good quality but that is to be expected for the price. The electrical cord could be a couple/three feet longer. The mounting scheme seems to be an engineering afterthought. I expected better -- seeing as it's a BenchDog switch for a BenchDog router table -- and would not make this purchase again. After purchasing this switch, I found another for $13 that I'm sure would have served just fine...a far cry from this 40-something dollar mistake."
2,MYOB Customer Service is Non-Existant,"However, this is the best multi-user small business accounting software available. Sadly, customer support is horrible and the company completely ignores its users.This Network edition is designed for peer-to-peer networking and despite the product advertising is *not* compatable within a client/server OS X environment. MYOB has conceded that there are no plans to include support for a client/server environment which limits the market for this product to only the smallest of small businesses.To reinstate the previous reviewer's statement, customer support from this company is horrible."
4,A Great Ride of Brit Pop Fun,"I found this album an improvement over PARKLIFE, which in itself was pretty good. The arrangements are fuller, busier, but never intrusive. There are more pop hooks scattered about - you'll probably be singing one of these songs in the shower the next morning. And the lyrics are generally well done. In fact, the only problem I had with the album as a whole was the lack of lyrical diversity - way too many tracks are stabs at the upper/upper-middle classes. Still, some of those are top notch songs. Shame on alternative radio for not making ""Country House"" the hit it should be. Other favorites are ""Yuko & Hiro"", ""Charmless Man"", ""Stereotypes"" and ""Universal"". Some tracks (""He Thought of Cars"") are quite odd, but they rarely sound deliberately so (odd-for-oddness-sake). The extra track (""Lot 14""?) is harmless fun. Pick it up and stick it to the man."
2,Turd Alert!,"This album is an absolute shocker and Blur realised it. This is easily Blur's worst effort and has some truly awful tracks to prove it. Mr Robinson's Quango and Dan Abnormal are top of the list. Every time Damon sings 'I want McNormal and chips or I'll blow you to bits' it never fails to make me cringe. If it wasn't for the awesome The Univesal this album would have had one star, unfortunately the bad tracks out-weigh the good ones on this. Buy Modern Life is Rubbish or Blur but not this turd of an album."
2,know what you pay for,"First, let me say I am a huge Blur fan. And I knew exactly what I was paying for when I got this-the exact opposite of what got me into them, Blur and 13. This is made for Britain: string and horn arrangements, and the so-called punkish Globe Alone (while not such a bad song), can't be compared to anything in the way Green Day or Bad Religion or whatever your idea of punk is. So, for U.S. Blur fans in it for their rock, don't bother unless you're a big fan."
1,Poor reproduction,I have collected photography books for years and have been thrilled with the improvements in reproduction especially with black and white images. This book however looks as if it was printed in the 50's. One can only hope that the originals are better than the reproductions. The subject matter has a nice theme but I could not get past the poor print quality to even try and determine if I liked the subject matter.
3,Tea at the Savoy,"Taking Tea at the Savoy by Anton Edelmann is a nice book which I think would be very helpful to someone wanting to replicate this experience. I found the recipes too complex for a novice cook. I would have liked it better if there were more pictures, and if they were in color."
1,Can't install on Macintosh OSX,Unable to install on macintosh OSX. Installer states that I do not have enough permissions and need to be logged in as administrator even when I AM logged in as administrator. Thus unable to run this on mac.
5,Excellent timeline,"Excellent timeline, good illustrations. This is the most complete overview of Church music I've seen."
3,LEDs bulbs burnt out,"The good: Great price through Amazon. The install took me a while as the light didn't fit into the old holes in the trailer. Made up some brackets (1) to drop the point of attachment and (2) better license plate bracket, no big deal. Much brighter than conventional bulbs and being submersible is a bonus.The bad: within 60 days, two of the LEDs on the right hand side light burned out, the remaining nine are still burning strong for now. Installation hardware is missing for the license plate. I did not use the included license bracket as it is a little flimsy. Wiring harness is very light duty, but I was able to use the existing trailer wiring. The ground terminal snapped off immediately when I tried to slip it over the mounting bolt. Replaced the terminal in favor of one with a larger hole and it worked fine."
1,BUYER BEWARE: Not the British Passenger,"Don't make the same mistake I did. This is not ""Passenger"" from across the pond. Not to fond of hard rock."
2,Read at your own risk,"As you will quickly realize, this is my first book review. As others have opined, this tome is impressive debut for so young an author. I became more and more involved with the plot and characters as I read, and at least at first, amazed at this young man's writing style. But the style that a first seduced me beame tiresome. With the characters also speaking in a no-longer spoken form, the question arises, ""why didn't Mason set the story in a earlier century. And with the story set in the late 20th century, why did these people have to send each other letters to communicate? What about e mail, or better just pick up the phone. I remained curious enough to see where Mason was going with all the superflous blather to finish the book. Read this wordy first novel at your own risk."
2,These characters weren't worth it.,"Try as I might, I couldn't find anything in these characters to like. I wanted to find a redeeming value in Ella, but at her essence there was nothing redeeming about her. The same for her cousin Sarah, and finally, James at 70 hadn't learned a thing. He was still juvenile. The writing, while at times slow, was still better than much of what is written, and the book did engage. But I learned nothing about the essential human nature and any redeeming value in relationships. That's too bad."
1,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE,"although the idea behind this book might be called old-fashioned - even though its set in the future! - it could have worked if Richard MAson had any skill at portraying real human warmth or feeling in the interactions and did not obsess soooo much over his snobby upper-class mindset. Another reason to be wary of the marketing of modern ""literature"""
1,pulp,"It is beyond my own ability, but perhaps in Mr Mason's grasp, to describe how flaccid and empty-headed this book is. I see no sign of cynicism, no appreciation of the anachronism of the book, and if Mr Mason was aiming at Waughesque wit, he missed his target. Instead he has only re-inforced an image of upper class society as being unconscious parodies of themselves, and their love affairs scripted in cliche and overwraught emotion. I wish Mr Mason every success in any career other than writing."
4,Just like telling an old story.....intriguing with flaw,"I'm impressed with Richard's style of telling his story, just like a little boy narrating an old story way before his time. There're bits of flaws and loopholes here and there. It's like someone relating a past incident and sort of neglecting some little justification logically.All in all,a tragic story well-written.It's a page-turner.Totally intriguing,make me want to why, how and what happened.... Richard Mason being a young and novice writer shines with his conspiring plot filled with mystery,guilt,dark secrets(literally drawer secret),death,scheme,unlawful acts and lies,etc... The disposition of his protagonist's past with his love,wife and all those life events and eventually to his discovery of ""the dark secret"" were creditable well-versed.With maturity and experience,Richard Manson will be promising. I'm looking forward to his next piece of work."
5,Wrapped up with a bow and delivered to your doorstep,"Enjoyed the book immensly. Author(s) do an excellent job in outlining the issues and providing the necessary background as to how and why things developed and insight on decision points and future offerings. Author did not bite on the hardware red herring but stayed the course on issues and requirements. Only crticism was over marketing of Broadbeam middleware woven into middleware discussion. This is easily excused when compared with other ""white paper"" type offerings. Very easy reading, recommend for technical and non technical alike."
5,Find this book!,"As much as I have enjoyed the other books on Barcelona that I have read, nothing has brought this spectacular city to life in quite the same way as Barcelonawalks. I went on the walks with a native who knows the city so well she can get navigate the labyrinth of the Barri Gotic with her eyes closed. The book was a revelation even to her. George Semler, the author, brings considerable reserves of insight, style and wit to the proceedings. As a book, it's a wonderful confection. As a guidebook (a recipe I don't ordinarily care for since they often do to their subject what the Kraft company does to cheese), it is more like private tour with someone who knows the broad arch of the city's rich history, the character of it's people, as well as a baroque quantity of entertaining minutia. Semler's restaurant recommendations alone might be worth the price of admission, as you are likely to find yourself the only tourist in various characteristic and popular neighborhood eateries."
3,Good Enough,"I really liked the subjects the book addressed, but Anna left me feeling so tired. She analyzes incessantly. I can read between the lines. I don't need the main character doing it for me.I wish I could give it more than three stars because I really liked the book itself. I just wished I could've heard less of her thoughts.My first Sue Miller book to read. I'll try her again, as I hope this isn't a pattern with her writing style, but just another ""issue"" that our Anna deals with."
4,Fantastic story,"this is my first sue miller novel and i have now ordered many of her other books. i found 'the good mother' brilliant, engaging and thought provoking. the author has a beautiful writing style with a spine tingling attention to detail. whether your heart breaks for the mother in this story or whether you believe she deserves everything she gets, this novel will evoke strong feelings and opinions. a very real exploration of motherhood and its complications."
5,"Real, Honest and Great Reading","This book dealt with powerful issues regarding the lifestyle of a woman needs to be both power of example to her child yet have a life of her own. Anna clearly realized she had to make a choice and the choice was her child though she lost dearly, both the relationship with her daughter and loss of Leo. Anna knew she could not reconnect with her daughter if she kept Leo in her life and she made a very brave and difficult decision. To amend her behavior she moved near her daugher for her comfort, giving up her own and left Leo and the friends she made in her town. Sue Miller did a great job."
2,Who cares.........,"I just finished reading this book, complaining the whole way how I did not like it. I should have put it down, but I thought it had to get better at some point. There was too much sex (graphic sometimes)and no substance. While You Were Gone by Sue Miller was better."
2,Didn't care what happened to the main characters,"I bought this book so I'd have something interesting to read during my son's tonsillectomy last fall. I was hoping to enjoy the torrid love scenes in it! I got half-way through the book, and it bothered me so much (my own issues getting in the way?), I put the book away. I felt Anna was emotionally neglecting her daughter, Molly, while involved in her lustful dysfunctional relationship with Leo. I didn't like any of the main characters, including Molly---all too unrealistic. But I picked up the book yesterday and finished it. The book was too flat! Though I don't think she was a BAD mom, she certainly exercised poor judgment (and for what? Like Leo was a good catch?)! I wasted my time (I don't read books very often) on this story. Yet I did read the whole book, hoping it would get better, so I'm giving it 2 stars. I didn't think I'd get any more of Sue Miller's books, but other reviewers said she has better novels."
4,Riveting...,"I couldn't put this book down! Miller has written a book that at times is troubling, and at times suspenseful, and ends on a shocking and sad note. No, I didn't respect the choices that the main character Anna made at times, and I think her character remained kind of stagnant and a little self absorbed throughout the book, but it was the premise behind the story that gripped me: Other people can and will decide for a child if a situation is deemed unfit.Was Molly's situation with her mother unstable or unfit based upon Anna's lifestyle and the two incidents that brought it all to question? Opinions will vary if Anna was indeed A ""Good Mother"", and for that reason I find this book extremely thought provoking and well thought out.A good, deep read."
5,Good book,I purchased this for someone else at the recommendation of a trusted friend that is a pastor/missionary. I didn't read it but would assume it is a good book for Christians to read.
5,Awesome,"Dressed to Kill is an amazingly awesome resource. Mr Renner's exposition of Greek words is a very necessary and helpful additive to any book. If you're ready to resist the devil, dressed in your spiritual weapons, do purchase this resource, if not please stay away from it. Knowledge always producing greater attack from the enemy, but know this, the greater the suffering the greater the blessing from God.Pastor Brenda"
5,Complete and inspired review of Christ,"I have never read a more complete and inspired treatise on the savior, Jesus Christ. The book discusses His premortal existence, mortality and after life and discusses the eternal aspects and connections from the old testament to modern day revelation."
5,True doctrine!,Wonderfully insightful account of the life of the savior written by one of His Apostles. A must read for any disciple.
5,An excellent lesson on the pleasure of giving,"I really enjoyed reading this book to my daughter Emily,age 3. It is a wonderful story about a boy who had five new pennies and spent them buying things for others. In such a greedy world we need to instill the power of giving to our children. The story is well written and the illustrations are enticing."
3,Not much substance,"All said, this video is OK. The production quality is very good, but lacks substance. I rate it two stars for the lack of substance and four stars for the production - average is 3 stars. The video starts out with an introduction on the construction of the back, explaining the 3 sections (cervical, thoracic and lumbar). Then it moves to a couple of stretches, followed by a handful of strengthening exercises. If you are experiencing back pain, this may be a good video for you to start with. Everything moves slowly and the instructor gives a couple of alternative methods for most of exercises. There were just not enough stretching or strengthening exercises for me."
2,yellow skirt,The skirt I received doesn't look like the one on the picture. My 9 year old daughter wanted it pink as we saw in the picture here and on the package and we received another color. It was a light yellow color. She didn't want to wear it and went to school wearing leggings in the bottom part. Her friends asked if it was a Harry Potter costume. On the Halloween day she didn't wear it at all.
5,Marked Picture Improvement and Great Price,"I've had great results with Monster products, and this is no different. The picture with the cables made up by Time Warner was OK - but not great. I ordered a pair of these cables to run to and from the Monster HTS 1000 MKIII 8-Outlet Power Center with Clean Power Stage 2 I purchased, and the picture quality was markedly better. Thinking it might just be psychosomatic, I had a friend look at it and we agree that the picture is definitely better with these cables.The knurled fittings on the end make it easy to get a tight connection without the need for tools.Monster is quality and when purchased from Amazon.com value too."
5,thirtysomething-the complete first season,"For those fiftysomethingers...this compilation of the first season of thirtysomething is just a trip down memory lane!!! Anyone who believed that Tuesday nights on ABC between 1987 and 1992 was a MUST SEE will want this dvd. Thanks to Ken Olin, Patricia Wettig, Mel Harris, Timothy Busfield, Melanie Mayron and the rest the cast and producers, these were a masterpiece in a scripted reality prime time tv show...When will the remainder of the episodes become available??? Can't wait"
3,More of a Idea Picture Book than a detailed how-to book,"This book packs in a lot of innovative, pictured ideas. However, it does not spend enough time on the detailed how-to instructions that I was looking to find."
4,Brit pop at it's best,One of the finest and very british albums of all time. Especially tracks such as Parklife and Girls & Boys which of course started the brit pop revolution. This album is best played at parties or at BBQ's or when you just feel like a good old sing along!. Definitely echo's the Kinks! curious? then buy it you wont be dissapointed.
3,This CD is for listeners who prefer a more mellow sound.,"Compared to 'Blink's' latest smash hit, 'Dude Ranch', this cd is somewhat understated. It does not have the loud guitar, vocal, or drum rifts as do the songs in 'Dude Ranch', i.e. 'Dammit'. Although, it does have some catchy tunes like 'Boys and Girls. Overall this is a good cd, but it sounds like this band is still searching for their sound."
5,A Fine Little Book!,"This is a wonderful book that describes the last days of Czar Nicholas II and his family. The emphasis is on the children --- son Alexis and daughters Anastasia, Maria, Tatyana, and Olga.The book is based on the recollections of the children's tutor, Pierre Gilliard, who accompanied them in exile for a time. It is filled with photographs, letters, and other memorobilia from Monsieur Gilliard's collection. These provide a delightful side to the tragic story of the last days of the Romanovs.It is a pity that this wonderful book is out of print."
2,what happened?,"I love the novels by A.M. Homes, and also like the short story collection ""The Safety of Objects."" But this one? Yuck! What happened? Either it was a rush job or she was just in a really foul mood when she wrote these stories, many of which are total head scratchers. If I wasn't puzzled I was totally repelled by the disagreeable characters in many of these stories. This collection was such a turnoff that I'll be thinking twice about reading anything else by her in the future. That's a shame, because I've enjoyed her novels very much, but there wasn't much of anything in here that was remotely enjoyable to read."
5,entertaining,Another excellent book of short stories from A.M. Holmes. I like her short stories because they are different and never boring. She isn't afraid to write stuff that may be shocking or disgusting to most people.
1,NEVER RECEIVED THESE,"I ordered two pairs of earrings from Gem Avenue - this pink crystal pair and the similar lavender/blue crystal pair. I received the lavender/blue crystal pair, but NOT the pink pair, although I was charged on my package invoice for both. Very bad service on the part of Gem Avenue. I ended up contacting Amazon & getting a full refund directly from Amazon (which, as always, had GREAT customer service). :-)I definitely would not buy from Gem Avenue again. I requested the refund from Amazon rather than pursuing an earring replacement from Gem Avenue because after seeing the lavender/blue pair in person, I was SO not impressed! I didn't even want the pink ones afterward. Anyway, I do not recommend this brand. It's just a bunch of cheap junk that looks wayyyy better online than it does when you receive it."
1,Laptop Stand,Too heavy. I rarely use it now. Would not recommend. Maybe a plastic one would have been better.
1,ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR CHILDREN,"We turned this off after a few minutes. First a man says ""damn"" repeatedly..which honestly, I couldn't believe that's what he was really saying--he had an accent and this was a CHILDREN""S MOVIE..so I let it go thinking, surely he said something else...NOPE..fast forward a few more minutes and several more damns and dammits....my child has never heard that word before and I'm sorry she had to hear it now. NOT HAPPY. This iS NOT a children's movie!!!!!!!!!!! Only gave it one star because I had to give it something..it doesn't even deserve the one star in my opinion!!"
2,intermatic Programmable timer,"i like this product but the last Intermatic programmable timer I bought lasted only one year before it malfunctioned.. Intermatic programmable timer, intermatic programmabe timerl"
1,Failed in 2 weeks,"I installed the timer and it worked fine though the dial was hard to read and the LED was dim. However, after two weeks the timer stopped working. I put the manual switch back in and the light works fine. I hope it's a fluck."
1,Don't Waste Your Money on This Timer!,"I had this timer less than 6 months.Not only that it was impossible to use, but short-lived as well.It is not even functioning now.I was so upset and decided to hire an electrician who put in a new timer.The new timer has working fine for 3 months now (knock on wood)!"
1,These are poopie!,"My husband keeps insisting that we put these timers on our lights, but quite frankly, they have failed either in the first week or first month. We have not figured out why they keep crapping out, but they do. We had them in our old house, but it was an old house with questionable electrical work so we blamed it on that, but now we have a new house and brandy new electrical and still the same outcome. Save your time and money and get a manual switch; then set your own timer to let you when to turn on the light!"
1,Didn't work,Installed product to replace a one that wore out and it did not work. Purchased another from a brick and motar store and it worked. Design of the product is not the best but it is one of the few to fit in double switch plates.
1,It broke within 2 months,"Just like several people said, I bought this because my old one broke after 5 years. I got the previous one at Lowe's, but could not find one in Lowe's anymore. I was happy to see the same model in Amazon, and bought one. The installation and setting the time were not very difficult. BUT, not even 2 months after it was installed, it broke with no reason. Probably the quality of Intermatic products is no longer as good as before. I will not waste my $$ again on this kind of device."
4,Timer,"Used it before, lot simpler than installing electric eye when you have more than one out side light to control."
4,Works Great!,"I purchased this timer from Home Depot in August 2001. It still works!!! Having no electrical skills, I was able to read the directions and install without having to pay an electrician the $25 that he asked for. Within weeks, I purchased and installed one for my mother and also installed one for my neighbor. They are still installed and working in both of their homes.Resetting the timer can be annoying since the directions are not intuitive. If I turn it off [Off-Clear] for a few hours and then program it works best. I do the same if I want to use the 24-hour self programming feature.I was surprised to find out that Home Depot no longer carrries this item."
5,Love these thermoses.,We gave this as a gift to my daughter's friend and she loved it. Keeps food warm until lunchtime. Best to follow the instructions and heat up the jar with hot boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Definitely keeps the food warm longer. Just wish there were separate compartments so all the food is not mushed together though.
4,Great and Comfortable!,I received the product promptly and it fits and feels great! I wear it during my morning workouts and even when doing work around the home.
3,The Nicest Room is on the Cover,"The rest of the book is page after page of heavy, ornate rooms that lack individuality and warmth. The decor is superficially beautiful because all the ""signals"" of wealth are there: expensive sofas and chairs, brocade curtains, period furniture, ""French"" bric-a-brac, but ultimately it's a collection of overly-designed showpieces."
5,Excellent exfoliation!!!,I have bought one of these wash clothes at least 3 years ago from another company or web site and LOVED it so much. When I went looking for another new one I found your site. I bought 3. I am very happy with my new one as they last for years and really exfoliate and make my skin very smooth.thank you for such a GREAT product.
1,"sorry, do not like this.","it arrived on time...but when i received this product it wasnt in its original package like pictured. It was never used, but it shrunk half its size, scrunged, and rolled up as soon as the water hit it. in which made it impossible to use for bathing. i am very disappointed with this buy...$10.00 worth of crap. wouldnt recommend this product to anyone."
2,There Is A Difference In Prducts,"Beware. The tag on the product I received listed it as Fine Texture. There was no mention of that on the Amazon order screen. These cloths were flimsy and didn't hold up. My fingers pushed through the weave while using it. I love the product in the blue box by Flower Valley, which is what I thought I was ordering."
5,Excellent study on Divine Philosophy,"Drawing primarily from the profound Writings and talks of 'Abdu'l-Baha (1844-1921), the Eternal Quest of God covers the full spectrum of topics concerning spirituality and man's relationship with his Creator.The work is well-organized and fascinating. I highly recommend it as both a scholarly and an inspiring exploration of Reality."
5,Must,"As a collector of musical scores, I thoroughly enjoyed this selection. It is rated as one of my favorites. But I must warn that if you do not like instramental style music, then this isn't for you. But if you are then this is a must."
5,It's the background soundtrack,"This is the music from the background of the movie, not the 50's music as on the original LP. Still interesting for the collector though!-Dave"
4,One man and a synthesizer,"This is not a disc of the classic rock of the film, but of Carpenter's typically minimal score. It's not one of his best, but it's good for the sad Carpenter addict (like your humble reviewer).He makes good use of a few cues, more like his earlier scores but he adds some simple textures elsewhere. Not as memorable as Halloween or Escape from New York and not as good as The Thing disc (with a lot of Morricone's leftover music) but decent enough.With the recent Special Edition DVD they should put together a combo of the score and the rock tracks, though I wouldn't bet on it soon.Some good tracks include the simple, driving cue heard when Christine runs down the despicable Moochie Wells, and also when Christine chases the rest of the 20-something high school delinquents in the film. Not the best Carpenter flick, far from his worst, that's about where the score is. Definitely Carpenter, but could have used fatter, fuzzier synths."
4,I received this book on time or before.,This is a really good book but personally I think the movie is better. Read the book and then see the movie.
4,Great CD,"I gotta say, this CD is great. I grew up during the 80's and these songs bring back some happy memories. My only dissapointment was the ending. ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"" has to be one of my favorite 80's songs. So when I heard what sounded like a ""glitch"" I immediately returned the CD to where I bought it and went to a different store to find a new copy. The first thing I did was play the last song, and, to my surprise, there was that ""glitch"" again. That was a very dissapointing way to end what could of potentially, in my opinion, been a 5 star CD. None the less, it is a wonderful CD including my favorite new song, My My My. If you can get past that ""glitch"" being there, then I say go out and buy this CD....."
1,Do not buy this product - DEFECTIVE,"I purchased this book new ( ~ $100). Many of my fellow students have purchased this book and the printing is so light that it is barely legible. It takes 2-3 times as long to read. Amazon offered to credit and replace, but it is a textbook and I cannot go without the book for week or two as I need it for my class.The 20% discount Amazon offered was an insult. The product is so physically defective that it is barely usable. The publisher and Amazon must realize that students must have their textbooks to do their assigned reading - so they have us over a barrel.My professor has complained to the publisher and is likely to discontinue using the text because of all of the problems. Amazon and Prentice Hall should be ashamed of their poor customer service.DO NOT TAKE A CHANCE ON THIS PRODUCT. IF YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS BOOK ,BUY IT USED SINCE THE USED COPIES THAT SAW SEEMED TO BE PRINTED LEGIBLY."
2,No Iron in this one,"I have a just turned 3 year old on the autism spectrum. One issue we face with her is picky eating. As a result, she has an iron deficiency. I've been told to address it with a multivitamin. She has always refused vitamins. I just barely got her to take the gummy vitamins, but I can't find any with iron. The Childlife Vitamin manufacturer didn't list the vitamins and minerals included in this vitamin, so I relied on a reviewer who stated that it contained iron. I got it today, and it does not contain iron.For those of you wondering, here's what's in the bottle: Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin D3, Vitamin E, Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folic Acid, Vitamin B12, Biotin, Pantothenic Acid, Calcium, Iodine, Magnesium, Zinc, Selenium, Manganese, Chromium, Potassium, Inositol, Choline Bitartrate.Other ingredients: Filtered Water, Fructose, Natural Flavors, Citric Acid, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, and Grapefruit Seed Extract."
3,Too sweet for a child!,"I like this product, it tastes good, but it's extremely sweet. My son has trouble to take it because it's very sweet and he's not used with so concentrate sweets. That's why I give it only 3 stars."
1,funny but,This movie has some funny parts but overall it is one of those bad movies what should have never been made. I don't like movies like this which is an insult to the intelligence of the audience.
1,So awful you could die laughing,"What's terrifically funny about this film is how awful it is. Every now and then the actors themselves seem to be laughing at it and at themselves. I found myself entranced by its stupidity, and often wondered who could make (or be in) such a farce. I gave it a 1 because I didn't want to be misleading, though I found it so outrageously funny I could easily have given it a 5. I almost wish to recommend that to fully appreciate its ridiculous, riotous humor, one should smoke some grass first. However, I wouldn't want anyone to injure themselves because you could die laughing so hard. It's the very worst film I've ever seen, yet it is mesmeric; I watched it on TV and could not get myself to change the channel; I wanted to see if it could get any worse and be even funnier."
5,"Funny, Funny Christmas Movie","This movie is a riot, but I wouldn't recommend for kids under 13. There is some very vulgar language. But it is a must see for adults! :)"

3,Nailbiter,"Different sort of role for Kitchen, unexpected. Has moments of high drama but somewhat contrived."
3,zipper foot,"I didn't use the zipper foot because after I received it along with a new sewing machine, the sewing machine included a zipper foot in the accessories. I returned the zipper foot but as always my purchases on amazon.com have been timely and exactly as advertised. I have rarely been disappointed."
1,Astonishly dumb show geared toward morons,"Unless you're a drunken frat boy (the target audience for this shallow, vapid show), don't waste your time on this nonsense."
5,just delicious - rich and molasses-y,"I made some caramel sauce with this sucanat, and another batch with coconut sugar. The sucanat sauce won by a landslide! It was stronger and tastier. Yummy!"
5,Spode Christmas Tree Mug,"Love the mugs! They completed my Spode set. Wish they were a tad larger, though. Nevertheless, they're a great addition to Christmas tableware."
5,The Punk Meets BiBi King,"This album is the best blues-punk album I've ever heard, admittedly not a well-travelled genre. Social Distortion hit their creative peak with this album, as shown by the classic tracks ""Bad Luck,"" ""Born to Lose,"" ""Sometimes I Do"" and the I-killed-my-baby lament ""99 to Life."" The guitars are loud but not overbearing and the vocals come strong through the mix. A fine record for parties and for crusing."
3,Good album,"Definitely my least favorite Social D. album overall. Sounds like someone was making the band record this against their will or something. The songs are great but it just comes across as flat as can be. Like they just hit upon some middle line and never stray from it. I just can't find the emotion or energy in any of the songs. Like the band hated each other and they locked them in a room and said, ""Play!"" But there are a lot of classic Social D songs on here and I've seen them live a bunch and these songs come off way better live. It's like Mike Ness was mad and pi**ed off, but instead of channelling it into the tunes he was holding back on purpose to spite someone. Almost like he was fed up with music."
2,to much country not enough punk 2.5 stars,i know htat social d is a great band and i also know that this is definately not thier best work its overated and i dont like country music. social distortion is a punk band with a country sound but there is to much country on this cd and not enough punk the best punk songs on this cd are cold feelings and bye bye baby. but everything else is to countryish like born to lose and making believe are my least favorites. everything else isn't enough punk.
2,"not recommended for punk fans, but great for hicks &cowboys",there is an equivalent of about 1 or 2 decent songs on this album. Other than that it's a country joy ride for shania twain fans!yee-ha jethrow! If your a fan of social distortion pick up mainliner its the best one. 1945 is a good song.
4,"Creepy intro, awesome beat","The beginning of this track is amazingly ambient and eerie at the same time, then, when Ms Sinatra sings, ""My baby shot me down"", the ""down"" gets sampled over and over and goes to a harsh but awesome beat. It samples ""My Baby Shot Me Down"", which Cher covered. It's an awesome club track."
1,Disappointing--Don't buy.,"I got this cover for my old video iPod. The clip does not work very well and it unhooks from my pants. Also, the closure for the iPod does not stay shut. My iPod has fallen out a number of times. I wrote to the seller and asked if he could make another recommendation but I got no response. I don't even care if I were to get a refund. I was hoping he had another case that would work better for me. The seller never responded. So in short I can say, THIS SUCKS."
4,"A crisp, authentic big band sound with updated vocals...","...lead off the music on this CD. If you saw the movie you may have missed it, but it's really good. There's no pretending here; the musicians on this CD obviously know the big band era, complete with swing tempos, sliding sax sections and walls of trombones and trumpets. But if that isn't enough to get you ""in the mood,"" the updated ""Danny Boy"" theme throughout the CD is. Even ""Amazing Grace... a hymn that must have been the most well-known tune to ever cross the English Channel... is represented here in an orchestral theme. Anyone whose eyes mist over when the war years are mentioned will enjoy this soundtrack immensely. The movie, incidentally, was almost as good as the music!"
4,Watch The Film First,"I bought this CD because I enjoyed the film. Simple as that. Most of the music is here and as with any soundtrack album the music is reasonably varied. Like I said in my title, watch the film first. If you like the score by George Fenton, here it is!"
2,No Cure Suggested,"Disappointed in this book. Author does not recommend using cures. I feel this is unsafe as far as microorganisms go, etc... A little disappointing."
3,Barbie Head,Be aware that the Barbie head is smaller than the ones you see in the stores. My daughter loves it.
2,WAS OK,Okay if you're into yoga and bending yourself inside out. Contained a few good stretching exercises that you could do without looking like some moron on the beach.
5,YOUR SOURCE FOR SURF TRAINING,"This book is by far the greatest source for surf training avaliable. Living on the beach or miles away, its exercises will put you in fit for all year long. Furthermore, it helped me out to avoid common surfing injuries, such as sore back. The cardio-workout section is the chapter that every surfer should know and do. Buy this book if your are looking for a complete guide for surf conditioning."
4,Elfman/Oingo Boingo Enliven A Very Strange Film,"This is the soundtrack forthe black-and-white, 16mm very-bad-dream-made-reality filmby Richard Elfman. You can enjoy this soundtrack CD without having first seen the movie, but your appreciation of the music will be much less. The music is veryOingo Boingo, in that it was driven solely by the creative genius Danny Elfman. As such, it is a must-have for any hard core Oingo Boingo fan. Best bits on the recording: The Forbidden Zone theme, ""Journey Through The Intestines,"" ""Alphabet Song,"" and ""Witch's Egg."" Notably missing on this CD is the wonderful rendition of ""Pico and Sepulveda,"" used for years byDr. Dementoas his theme song. Your final bit of Forbidden Zone trivia: For those legion of lovers of Dilbert and theanimated TV show, the TV show's theme song is a slightly modified ""Forbidden Zone"" theme. Strange music from a strange film, and well worth your investment."
3,CD missing 2 crucial cuts,"""Pico and Sepulveda"" and ""La Petite Tonkinoise"" have vanished from the CD version. Josephine Baker's ""Tonkinoise"" is readily available on anthologies of her music, but just TRY to find ANYTHING by Felix Figueroa and his Orchestra. ""Pico and Sepulveda"" is one of my favorite songs from the movie (which in itself is an all-time favorite) and its absence here is a major disappointment. That being said, what remains is great, and the CD is worth having, but hang onto the original LP if you're lucky enough to have it, otherwise you'll be missing two of the film's musical high points."
4,ATD 7441 Stand,Pros: Easy to assemble. Works good.Cons: Need to be careful when moving the stand because the guts can fall out if you do not keep the stand vertical when moving. Chain that is attached to the rubber bumper needed to be removed because it gets twisted around the screw when you are raising or lower it.
5,Worth the price for the animated films,What surprised me was Marvel didn't do the same for it's Hulk or Spider Man at the time. It would have been nice to see a feature film animation treatment this one had. All in all I did love to see these again unedited and without commercials. After watching the characters interact I wanted to see the eventual series. It's too bad there isn't a CGI version on the air today. We need G.I. Joe on TV more than ever. Yo Joe!
2,quantity vs quality,"One thing I really liked about this cookbook was the section where you mark the recipe ""loved it ( ), hated it ( ), maybe we'll try it again ( ), we'll use it for unwelcome guests ( )"". Really liked the layout and background information on the sauces. Unfortunately, I did not like one sauce that I tried (I tried about 10 out of 160). I was looking for Marsalla wine sauce, Madera wine sauce, and tomato pasta sauce. I'm still looking."
2,Poor subscribe and save service,"This product is fine - I have taken it for 12 years. Amazon subscribe and save service is a disgrace. I take more than one pill a day, so I frequently click the ""need more right away"" tab. In August, I ordered an extra delivery 5 days prior to the scheduled delivery. Amazon held the order and shipped it in the same package as my normal delivery, so now I am without medicine for the holiday weekend. I'll know better than to order an extra shipment through the subscribe and save program in the future."
2,Not Exactly A Safe Charcoal Starter,"This starter does as advertised, gets the charcoal going with basic newspaper. I have found that it sometimes takes more then one try to get coals started, especially on damp/humid days. My biggest concern is the handle!! The metal straps that are bent into the wooden handle have actually come out while picking this unit up to pour the coals into the grill. In my opinion this is not a very safe starter and a good way to get your legs burnt or worse, have your clothes start on fire.. It is what it is... a cheap piece of junk! I will be getting a Weber Charcoal Starter, for safety and durability!"
4,Nice,Very interesting book to read. I like the hard core information he presents and jaw dropping facts. Its amazing what research can find

2,Stencils are a little on the small size and only one time use only.,"The stencils in this kit are way to small and will only work on average sized pumpkins, also the stencils are only good for one use."
3,THIS IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE U.K. VERSION,"After buying a multi-region DVD player so I can watch foreign DVD's I purchased THE LONE RANGER:THE COLOUR EPISODES via Amazon UK.This edition has all 39 of the 5th season color episodes, so if you have or are willing to buy a multi-region DVD player the U.K. Lone Ranger boxed set is a much better buy.And don't be fooled by any misguided reviews criticizing these episodes for being ""colorized"".All the 5th season episodes were originally filmed in color."
4,Say hello to Jolyon Wagg!,"Herge, The Calculus Affair (Methuen, 1956)Everything's back to normal in Tintin's world-- that is, until things start breaking for no apparent reason. Everyone's in a tizzy except Calculus, who's off to a Geneva convention (get it?). Tintin, suspecting Calculus' talk at the convention may have something to do with the breakages, checks out Calculus' laboratory and discovers the professor's been working on a luftkanone. Needless to say, the endlessly-warring Syldavians and Bordurians both want to get their hands on the invention. Perhaps most notable for introducing the latest thorn in Haddock's side, insurance agent Jolyon Wagg, The Calculus Affair is a somewhat minor, but still very enjoyable, entry in the series. ****"
3,Sonic Geneva,"Professor Calculus is kidnapped while in Geneva, and Captain Haddock and Tintin go out to find him...""The Calculus Affair"" (1956) is Tintin #18. Wasn't a fan of this one much. Feels a bit forced, though I like the start and cover. Herge, from this point on, took more time with his comics. Heard he was getting a bit sick of Tintin at this point. Lot of the funnier elements in this one would end up in ""The Castafiore Emerald"" (1963), which I think's a clever comic."
3,It's OKAY,"To be honest, I didnt really care for this story. All the different schools and the different ""fighters"" from each school... its gets confusing and hard to keep track of all the different names, who is who and from what school. It just gets annoying. The premise of all these high school kids fighting to be the top-ranked school, and at the same time fulfilling the destiny within their sacred bead, just wasnt so exciting to me. There are some plot twists with the characters, but overall the story-line was a little boring. There is comedy in there also, usually in the form of the main character being so studid and naive. But the comedy is not that much. There is plenty of ""fan service"" if you wanna see a TON of panties and bare breasts with no nipples. Not a horrible series but nothing I would ever care to re-watch. Even at only 13 episodes I was kind of anxious for it to end. I dont regret checking it out or having it in my collection though."
1,Serves no purpose but fan service,"Nothing to see here folks...unless ofc you're a huge fan of Ecchi. The fight scenes/action are decent at first. Eventually, it all becomes repetetively drab. The story's extremely simplistic and never goes anywhere interesting. The writing and characters never rly surpass their generic, mostly perverted/sadistic, superficial personalities. The animation isn't terribad but nothing memorable.I bought this expecting lots of action-packed, varied fights and some fan service. I wasn't left with much but the latter (excluding disappointment) once the season was over. I honestly almost felt pity imagining the target audience for this. ""S.A.V.E."" your money and pass on this unless Ecchi is what you're searching for."
1,JUST GOT RIPPED OFF! BEWARE!,"Read the back cover of the box very carefully. What at first seems like a very attractive 3 disc collection of songs by original artists will soon disappoint. Look for the words ""Made famous by"" in the artists column. I missed them and ended up spending $18.00 for mediocre remakesof some classic songs. Though this pick-up band trys to please, they are hampered by poor sound balance and far too many artistic styles to mimic. Be aware that this set is not part of the authorized Pure Mood series that featured all original artists, through the years. How the hell did they get away with it?"
4,Score for four more eerie sounds than actual music.,"Working solo this time, Alan Howarth, long time composing partner with John Carpenter, creates a refreshingly creepy sound for his 'score' for Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers.With the exception of the Halloween Theme and the staccato chase theme there is no real music to be found on the album, just a chilling sonic impression of evil and menace. Recommended to fans of the off beat, where 'music' is more an audible sensation than a coherent theme."
2,"Remastered yes, but at wrong speed","My favorite album of all time. Easily 5 stars on the quality of music. However this re-issued gold disc has a longer running time than the original and it is not due to any additional music. The sound itself is beautifully done, no question, but if you're a fan of the original, you will easily notice the tracks have been remastered at the wrong (slower) speed. Disappointing. City To City deserves nothing less than perfect sonic integrity; look for Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab's Original Master Recording on vinyl if you can find it."
4,Good Listening,"Probably best known for his hit song ""Baker Street"", there are several other songs that got a lot of airplay. All of it is good listening. Thanks again to Amazon for providing the access to be able to purchase an old recording that you couldn't find anywhere else."
5,i just wanna say.,once you start listening to this you probably won't be able to stop so if you aren't into addictions i wouldn't recommend buying it.
4,Gerry Rafferty's finest hour of music,"In the late 70s when my family would pile into our van and make the yearly summer trek nine hours from Colorado to Utah, the song Baker Street was always on the radio. After buying a few of his greatest hits I finally got City To City on cd. Of the ten tracks I think there are only a couple weak songs, the rest are all great. Gerry has always been an excellent songwriter all the way back to his days with Stealers Wheel (Stuck in the middle with you, Star). I find his unique slightly nasal voice very soothing. A few of his other albums like Night Owl are worth owning but this is his creme de la creme, 4 1/2 stars!"
5,An overlooked masterpiece!,"Do a quick internet search, and you'll see Academy Award winner Jerry Goldsmith's huge, ever-growing resume. Out of all of his brilliant work, this is my very favorite! The music, like the movie, is truly fantastic! Also of note: A portion of the first track, ""The Construction,"" was utilized in first season commercials for the science-fiction television series ""Sliders."" (which featured explorers of a different sort) Whether you're a fan of the ""Explorers"" film, a long-time fan of ""Sliders,"" or simply a fan of great musical scores, you should BUY THIS ALBUM!"
4,Get this soundtrack!,This is the greatest soundtrack of all time the composer did a great job to make the music beautiful.
4,classic,"Like the title states, it is a classic. I really love these old kung fu movies. I actually bought this one without seeing it first based on how much I liked the remake or really the later version of this movie with jet li & I wanted to see how it all began. It's a good movie."
2,"Could have been a sleeper hit, but for the bugs. . .","I have rarely, if ever, played a first-person shooter this bug-ridden, and that's too bad since the actual gameplay, while it's nothing original, is pretty good (even if the plot is seriously lacking). But you can only find so much enjoyment from a game that kicks you to your desktop whenever it feels the urge, or forces you to endure horrendous scenery glitches. What could have been one of the year's sleeper hits in the genre is wounded by its own severe lack of polish, despite all its beautiful graphics, realistic physics, and its awesome assortment of weapons. Out of the box, ""Devastation"" is devastating, and you, as a gamer, should never have to pay to beta test. Wait for the next genre offering to come along instead - there are plenty looming on the horizon."
2,"Really bad game, but fun.","This game is really bad, extremely buggy, and a complete rip-off of 3 games: Red Faction (bugs,""Antique Machine Gun"", Red Faction 2 (everything can be duel, similar graphics), and Counter-Strike (purchasing system). The graphics are good, however, sounds of the guns/explosions are terrible, and the character body structure is too bulky. Don't buy Devastation unless you like amusing games that which are loaded with glitches and tile errors. And multiplayer isn't very good, either."
1,Pay to Beta Test,"I had high hopes for this game. It is a good idea with a very bad implementation. It is one of the buggiest shooters I've ever seen. You are basically paying to beta test this game. Even after the official retail patch, it still crashes and bullets never connect with opponents. If the store I bought it from would take the return of this game, I would return it. Don't be stuck like me. Skip it."
1,Crack after few years,These are supposed to be high quality stock pots. We bought 4 of them in the past. By now all of them have cracked bottom. We use them only to simmer broth - nothing unusual. One of them is used only one week a year for Passover. And yet few years later the enamel cracks. Stay away from these.
4,Serves Its Purpose,"I only use the pot to boil water in. I don't cook food in it. The non-stick enamel is very easy to clean off hard water residue. The pot did arrive with some small chipped area inside the pot, so I suppose if I actually cooked food in it, those chipped areas would get worse over time. I am totally obsessed with red but sometimes the red color can be too bright or too dark but I think that the red color on this pot is perfect and if everything else in your kitchen is red like in my kitchen this pot should blend well. Overall it serves its purpose."
5,One of my favorites of favorites,"That's it. One of my all-time favorites, period. I once flunked a tryout with the Dodgers at Ebbits Field in '52 -- and can well relate to EVERYTHING going on, especially the mixed cultures (even though I lived in Northern Jersey). Simply, well worth the time! Good stuff."
3,You Decide- written by 2 students from Mercy High School,"Snow in August is a good historical novel with an unexpected dose of fantasy at its end. A twelve-year-old Catholic Brooklyn boy befriends a poor rabbi from Prague. Their mutual desire for knowledge strengthens their relationship, and they teach each other their cultures and languages. Both face many hardships, mostly because of their religious beliefs and uncommon friendship. When things get really bad, the boy and the rabbi build a fantastic creature from mud to solve all their problems. We, personally, did not care for the ending very much, but gave Snow in August three stars because we enjoyed the rest of the novel. Please consider reading this book and forming your own opinion."
3,Snow in August Review,"The book was good except for the ending which was way too happy. The book had good ideas and an interesting plot, but the religious propaganda it instilled in the minds of young readers was ridiculous. The golem stuff was just plain dumb. I DONT THINK SO MR HAMILL... oi!"
4,The Jibba Review,"We believe that Snow in August is a cool book yall. We had to read it for english class, and we think that it brings out many elements of a good book to read, for anyone who likes coming of age novels with children and adult interaction. This has many great aspects of maturing and examining a child's realization to the world and his perception of evil, religion, and every day decisions in an adults life, that a child must learn to understand. Go ahead and read this book you can get a lot out of it! And it needs more cow bell!!- Old time joke...Kristy: I thought the book was delightful and I couldn't put it down; even, if I was on the beach during spring break. Micheal had quite an imagination, although the ending was blown out of proportion. It probably would have been better if the Rabbi wasn't healed miraciously recovered. The ending should of been more thoughtout. It made me finally pick up my book on the KABBALAH after 2 years of ownership."
2,"All things considered, wish I hadn't","Mostly enjoyed the first 3/4 of the book, but wound up VERY disappointed in where the author took the lead character. I'm not sure how other readers found an ugly, violent revenge an inspiring ending. I was disgusted."
3,I don't like fairy tale endings..,"Never thought a book about any young boy could hold my attention, but this one did. It mirrored so many of my own questions about the Jews (and hey, how DO so many people see a baseball game on a workday?) But the fantasy ending reminded me of how they wrapped up the movie-""the Green Mile"""
3,A great book for the first 4/5's.,"The begining of this book is fantastic. I love the way Hamill makes you a part of all that goes on in 1947 Brooklyn. Unfortunately the ending is extremely disapointing. What was until then a beutiful book and completely believeable is ruined by fantasy, and on top of that when the antagonist is finaly put in his place it's done with one of the most grotesquely bloody revenge scenes I have ever read. I felt almost cheated by the way the book turned out. A very disapointing ending!"
3,marks poo poo head review,"i thought that the book had a lot of good points and was all around really good. i could relate to the characters and i really enjoyed the theme plots, and just most of the book. the only thing that really upset me was the end. i absolutely hated it. i thought the book was very realistic and then this happy, every thing is ok don't worry ending just came out of no where and it really upset me. however i did enjoy the book very much."
3,an ok book,"It was a really good book until the end. I dont want to ruin it for those of you who haven't read it. It is an ok book, and if you can find time to read it do so, but if not you aren't missing to much."
2,Confused,"The author seemed very confused on how to end this novel. He write a lovely story about an unlikely friendship in a troubled neighborhood. Unable to come to an ending, he takes the book into a Harry Potter land of make believe. Make up your mind what type of genre you're writing for!"
3,a review,"Snow in August was a wonderful book with the exception if the ending. Pete Hamill proved to be an extrodinary author until the ending came. Snow in August is a perfect book to show the breakthroughs in racism. It shows how old and young people can become friends. And most importantly, Snow in August shows how beliveing something hard enough can make magic really happen. It reminded me of how when i was young, how much I believed in and how miracles did happen. As I gew older though, my mind somewhat closed a little...from believeing in magic. Snow in August has reminded me of so much i once had, but lost. To see two people, so different yet so much alike, come together as one is exceptional. The power of words has also played a role in this story. Michael had to fight with himself to get his morals straight, but all turns out well at the end. I would've given better rates to this book except a few scenes seemed so hastily written."
5,Snow in August,"FROM COLORADO - Not all of us are disappointed in the choice of book by Gov. Owens...I applaud his choice. I found Snow in August a fantastic and enjoyable book. It covered so many controversial topics from the innocent eyes of an 11 year-old. What a wonderful way to get back to looking at these topics from the way they should be viewed...from unbiased and open eyes. There is a lesson for everyone in that book. The ending did surprise me, but as we should remember - eleven year-olds have rich imaginations, we should all be so lucky!"
3,No widescreen?,"For a show that airs on an HD only network I'm confused as to why the DVD doesn't even support wide screen format. I was really looking forward to purchasing this, but now I may just hang onto the episodes saved to my tivo."
3,The Earth Trembles,"""Earthquake"" is an interesting blend of jazz, pop and classical styles that has the listener wondering if this is really for a disaster film, since John Williams wrote a nice score where the pop and jazz moments are the best on this album. The earthquake sound effects are the only things that lead us to say ""Yes, this is for a disaster movie."" However, I felt kinda disappointed of the classical part of this album because it bores. Maybe Mr. Williams was saving his classical chops for something better."
4,"Clap hands, here come's Charlie!","If you keep in mind that Victor Hugo's classic book is 1000+ pages, you can appreciate how surprisingly well the 1935 version of the film actually succeeds in creating a sketch of this very intricate, envolved story. However the strong point of this film in its cast also represents its centreal problem -Charles Laughton! Mr Lughton, not even being a handsome fellow is mesmerizingly effective as the villain, Inspector Javert in this picture. Incredibly talented, skillful actor. The problem is that he often outstages Fredric March (Who also did a very good job) so profoundly that the focus of the veiwer is easily shifted from the hero Jean Valjeane to the villain, Inspector Javert when it is probably not intended. That said, a movie can have much worse flaws than a distractingly powerful performance by the villain, so enjoy!"
5,1935 version is the best!,"I love Fredric March and this version is outstanding. The story of course, is so good and so raw and the actors are fabulous. I don't think you can beat Fredric March's portrayal in this film. I haven't seen the latest version out, however, I do not care for this story as a musical and so probably won't see it. This film is not a musical. I'm not sure who decided to make it a musical and not sure why- it does not need that element. I highly recommend the 1935 version."
3,Les Miserabls 2 disc set,I enjoyed the 1935 version of Les Miserables but I did not receive the other disc for the 1952 version. There was only the one disc in the case although I thought I was purchasing a 2 disc set.
4,For the fans.,"All the hits are here, both the comical and the serious.Great listening. Quality sound."
2,no chemistry,"Sofia (Amanda Peet) and husband Tom (Zach Braff) expect their first child. How can they raise the child when Tom loses his job? Tom then takes up Sofia's father's offer to work with him. There, he meets wheelchaired Chip Sanders (Jason Bateman) who gradually makes Tom's life hell, both personally and professionally. Tom has to prove that Chip is out to destroy him.Some parts were funny, but this is not the comedy of the year.There was absolutely no chemistry between Zach Braff and Amanda Peet.Jason Bateman was possibly the only good actor and even then! - although all of the actors overacted, especially Sofia's parents (Charles Grodin & Mia Farrow).This should have been a straight-to-video flick. I almost fell asleep on it, as the jokes were old and so not that funny, and very predictable.The ending is obviously a happy one, but at least Tom gets to avenge everything that happened to him.Watch at your own risk. Rent it if you absolutely have nothing else to choose from."
2,And I though Zach Braff could do no wrong.,I have always enjoyed anything that Zach Braff touches. His charm and wit has always created wonderful movies and t.v. episodes. Or at least I thought it did until I watched this movie. I found the plot dull and boring. The characters were not developed enough to become attached to or care about their outcome in the store. Story may have worked better with just a couple dating instead of a married couple who just recently became parents. The story lines did not seems to flow together.
1,THE EX...CREMENT! 1 3/4 STARS!,"Well, well, well! It's hard to be positive about this perplexing film. It's not funny enough to be a good comedy, it's not romantic enough to be a good love story and it's not a very good movie period! This film's only saving grace is a good cast. It's a shame, as the movie has some funny moments, but it's negated because it's so irritating! Zach Braff plays a likable guy who has no backbone and that is only the tip of the iceberg. Jason Bateman who is a fine actor plays a particularly unlikable character so well, you just want to ring his neck. I know if I were in the situation Braff was in, I would have taken care of this Jack A$$ after the second day at my new job. As comedies go this one just isn't very enjoyable, but somehow I managed to watch the entire movie mostly because I like the actors involved."
2,Could have been much better,"The scrubs guy plays a husband who has just had a baby to his wife and lost his job. So he moves back to her parents neighborhood to take a job offer from her old man. Another guy working at the company is played by Jason Bateman who plays a guy in a wheelchair who hates the scrubs guy for marrying his high school girl. He tries to do everything he can to see Scrubby fail at his job to get him fired while also trying to break up their marriage so he can move in on her.Overall; there is a few laughs, but it needed a lot more then what it does have to make it stand out as something other then an average comedy at best."
5,Brilliant!,"I've loved this book for so many years and read it every once and a while for a sort of tune-up. Its so beautifully written. The lead character Aspasia is such a fascinating creature. Its inspiring to see her rise through life, using her talent and ability. The courtesan life is not only interesting to look into, but its also of interest to view the male-female relationships of the time (ancient Greece). If you haven't read this, and you have a penchant for delightful historical novels, this is one of the very best."
4,Johnny Tillotson 25 Greatest Hits,"A CD I have been trying to obtain for some time. Good service, from placing order to receiving delivery. Well pleased."
5,Use it differently,"instead of following the instructions and using it as a water based mix, I mixed it in with starter fertilizer and used a spread seeder. great results; lawn is lush green. only downside, i've had to mow it twice as much."
3,"This album does not have ""Who's name do you ride"" on it!!!","It shows it playable on the media player, but isn't on the album itself, very disappointed, as that is my favorite track!!!"
4,better than expected,"though I was forced to read this as a summer reading book, i actually ended up enjoying this book more than my other booksheh"

4,antipop,"As someone once correctly put it ""Autechre makes dance music you cannot dance to"" but you cannot stop your soul dancing even if you are sitting peacefully at home! In the first of the three tracks here ""Lost"",there's a relatively simpler,fragile tune over mad banging percussion.Brilliant! The standout track is the second one ""Djarum"",which on first listen sounded to me as an collage of (earlier) Autechre.It makes you feel strongly of something which is usually indescribable.It builds up layer by layer until it reaches a climax midsong. The third song ""Flutter"" may be put here for a good cause but musically it's not very attractive. Anyway this is a good record to start.If you like this,you'll love ""Amber"" and ""Tri Repetae++"".Be sure that you'll be easily addicted to this uneasy listening.And if you're already addicted to Autechre,this one will be another gem in your collection."
4,"A little different, more ""spiritual,"" but still good stuff","This album has more of a ""spiritual"" sound and feel, but it is still an essential part of any EW&F collection. Make no mistake, there are some funk standards on this album - ""Getaway"" and ""Saturday Nite"" - but many tracks - including some of the mellower selections (the title track and ""Earth, Wind & Fire,"" to name a couple) have more of a ""sipitual"" sound and feel than other of the group's slow jams. That is understandable, given the cirumstances under which the album was made."
2,Not a trail guidebook--title is misleading.,"I ordered this book under the misconception that it was a guide to trails in the park. The title, I feel, is misleading. This book is actually a collection of essays about the author's experiences hiking the park."
1,Firmware upgrade partially disabled it,"My goal was to select Wireless Client mode to use it as a wireless ATA to connect to my main router upstairs. The Site Survey appropriately found external networks, including my upstairs router. Unfortunately I decided to upgrade the firmware, which restored the SMCWTVG to factory settings. The Site Survey never worked again. It still appears to work OK as a router and Access Point though."
1,Seriously Disappointed,"We bought this game for our 4 1/2 year old since it had 3 discs for a variety of ages. It is horrible--the graphics are terrible, Sera and the ""announcer"" for the game speak at the same time so the child can't tell who to listen to. With one of the games, where you had to sort out where creatures lived, you could click the shark into the water spot 4 times and it wouldn't take, then on the 5th try it would. Very frustrating. After breaking down in tears 3 times (That would be mother and child!), we decided to put this game away--forever!"
2,Can you call this a cast album?,"Reconstructions of neglected musical scores of Gershwin and Porter are among the great joys of our time, but this is something else. The production on which it is based used a patchwork libretto, interpolated songs from other shows and reduced the orchestrations. The result sounds less like a cast album than low budget Porter complilation. Yes, the (all too?) familiar singers do a great job."
4,"""I can see a movie coming out of this book!""","""The Sounding of Horns"" is the story of three strong people -- woven together like three plaits of hair -- into one dense novel. Set mainly in Philadelphia in the 1920s, but involving old ties back to Italy, it combines music, romance, and personal and political intrigue.I can see a movie coming out of this book! There are some great dramatic/climactic scenes, a broad background of people and places, and characters who speak and act for themselves without a lot of author prose to explain them to you. A lot is left unsaid or, rather, said in looks and body language. You feel it rather than read it. It's a fresh and different story, written in a fresh and different way -- a full meal for the unhurried reader."
3,SAY SALAAM INDIA is an honest attempt.,"the tracks playing in the background [music: Gaurav Dayal] are in sync with the mood of the film. Special mention must be made of the background score ' Gaurav Dayal [effective], cinematography ' Fasahat Khan [appealing] and editing ' M. Rafique [crisp].The performances spring a pleasant surprise. Sanjay Suri, a dependable actor, is in top form yet again.The film has a bunch of new characters, but the ones who stand out are Aditya Seal [playing Siddharth, the rich, spoilt brat], Mandhar Subhash [Viru] and Anuj Pandit [Guri]. All three are excellent. Prateek Jain [Mahipal] and Madhur Mittal [Shakeel] are alright. Manoj Pahwa is fantastic yet again and provides ample laughs. Sachin Khedekar is alright. Vinay Pathak gets limited scope. Shraddha Nigam is effective.SAY SALAAM INDIA is an honest attempt."
4,Good job by the Sisters,"I just got the CD..very good. Favorites include Doctor Jeep, the Temple Of Love remix, and Lucretia My Reflection.Do yourself a favor and get this..rather than another album such as Vision Thing...Vision Thing is one of my least favorite songs on the album, good beat, but not-so-good lyrics. The drum machine really adds a lot to the songs on this CD. Buy it!"
5,Goth rock to its finest,I'd highly recommend this best of to any new fans of the Sisters. The choice of songs is decent and the audio is great. More cow bell would be great though :)
4,A must-read for every engineer and scientist.,"I have not read the latest copy, but had the opportunity to attend one of Ms. Melba's seminars on technical writing using her 1977 copyright. Bottom line . . . drop the jargon and stop trying to prove your intelligience. If only everyone understood ""What, Why, How, Now What?""."
3,My first uncomfotable Rockports,"I have bought Rockport Dressport wing tips since the 1980s after seeing an ad in which a guy ran a marathon in them. Now those were comfortable shoes and I wore nothing else at work for 20 years. Now I can't find them so I tried the Farren. It's a regular shoe - a bit plasticky, very uncomfortable to begin with and now, after about 8 months, I no longer hate to put them on. But it is not what I expected from Rockport. Instead of leaping into my next Rockport purchase with confidence I'm going to be cautious. Very disappointing."
5,Statistics won't remain static anymore,"Nowadays every spreadsheet program such as Excel or 123 come with a complete Statistics module that can crunch the numbers in an instant and give you a complete analysis of any set of numbers, leaving those who grew up with MINITAB in awe.However, what these powerful programs won't and can't help you, is in grasping the meaning it. When to decide when to reject or accept a null hypothesis. Let alone what all that means. This is where this CD-ROM/ book set come into play.The program provides a very comprehensive introductory course in Statistics. It has some very interesting videos on real life applications to Statistics, more than 200 self score test questions and a very comprehensive and logically structured text.Perhaps this product won't replace a tutor, but it definitely help Students, Home Schoolers, or anybody interested in Statistics to increase their understanding of this some times obscure art. I think it is definitely a winner."
5,Bruce Willis Sings!!!,"There may only be two songs that Bruce Willis Sings with Danny Aiello, but they are hilarious. Very good soudtrack."
1,"Typical ""No Europeans Before Columbus"" party line","Its great that a Peabody Professor can find fault with everything that does not fit in with the same old story. Williams is dead wrong on several issues. The Vinland Map has been authenticated. The Norse were in America. New Hampshire's Stonehenge dates to 3000 BC. Carib Indians had ""canoes"" that held more people that the ships of Columbus. Being anally retentive serves to excuse destroying everything pre-Columbian, including people, culture, monuments and even written text."
4,Buffalo drum,great sound. The only problem is it is starting to buckle on the surface which is causing a little ripple.
4,Very good,By Cindy Mokund: I think this product is an excellent purchase because the cream helps you remove the death cells of your skin with the help of the sponge making all your body look younger. I can not give an opinion about the pad because i haven't use it
3,Good for my purposes,The LCD picture is not the gratest -- but good enough for my kitchen. The DVD player is a great feature.
5,great gift,Wonderful coffee and biscotti package that was a gift for my husband. The whole bean coffee tasted wonderful in his new French press! Items were well packaged and arrived with no damage.
1,No instructions,Been unable to figure out how it works because it arrived with no instructions or package. Just the stop watch in an envelop. Really can't rate the product.

4,Excellent Bible book!,This is a must for the serious bible student! Just will help you know the bible better and deeper if used properly.
4,"Looks intimidating, but it's not!","This ruffler foot looks like a monstrasity, a little intimidating but it is in fact very easy to attach as it is a snap on foot. It pleats your fabric every 1, 6, or 12 stitches, you decide. I am not sure why, could be user error, but I have broken 3 needles on the two times I have used it. I made sure it was lined up correctly, but each time after stitching a few hundred stitches or so, my needle hits the foot and breaks. I am not giving up on it as this is a really great attachment."
4,Only one downside - slightly messier than paper,"Great product, great quality but when it sits for a while after the brewing is done and the cup is gone there are always a few coffee drips, I didn't have this problem while using paper."
1,"Too small, wrong dimensions listed","The actual dimensions for the Cuisinart GTF-4 are 3-3/4"" x 3-3/4"" x 3"", not the 4x4x3.5 as listed...too small for my coffee maker."
1,Incorrect Description,This filter as described here does not fit the four cup coffeemaker. It works on the larger units and it is labeled and described incorrectly.
1,Claber Noxxle,This is definately a waste of your money. As in another review this nozzle leaks and restricts pressure and generally is not what it claims to be.No wonder there is only a 30 day guarentee.
1,Lots of errors,"I noticed a lot of errors while using this book. When you are taking the exams - the answers don't match the rationale. For example - the book says the answer is #2, but the rationale matches the answer for #3. Not recommended."
5,Truly a classic animal tale,"Babe captured my heart, as he was trying to save his own skin. This book is truly a classic animal tale, where the creatures take on believable and human emotions and personalities. We see intelligence, fear, hope, and love, in a heartwarming pig, and his other animal friends. The inter-species bond between Babe and his human farmer is delightful! I have read it several times, and each time, see another angle, in this Pig-Shepherd memoir. Should not be limited to any age group, because adults as well as children will be entertained.Arlene Millmanauthor of BOOMERANG - A MIRACLE TRILOGY(The tale of a remarkable Boston Terrier)"
5,A terrific book with something for everyone.,"The Enormous Egg is a wonderful book for anyone. It has the humor to keep all ages amused and the suspense to keep the younger readers turning the pages. Written from the perspective of a young boy, it is personable to the reader. From a teaching perspective there are numerous uses for this book; how DO you convince someone there is a dinosaur in your barn? Can you convince the congress to pay for the upkeep of an ""ugly"" Triceratops? I whole heartedly recommend this book."
2,soundtrack,I was alittle disappointed in the cd as i was expecting more track on it i felt there were a couple of songs that was in the movie that wasn't on the cd
5,An excellent album,"I gave this CD 5 stars, because it contains some of the best songs I have heard in a while: Bleeding Me, Outlaw Torn, House Jack Built, Thorn Within, Until It Sleeps, and Mama Said. The only songs I usually skip when listening to this CD are Ronnie, Poor Twisted Me, Cure, and Wasting My Hate. The whole CD though is listenable and shows great maturity in Hetfield and gang and is the better of the two Loads."
3,Very good album,"This is generally a good album, if you don't mind Metallica's softer side. On this album, the vocals, in my honest opinion, are the only improvement over older-style Metallica. Otherwise, the songs are slower, even more commercial sounding than the so called Black album. In fact, the only two songs on the album that even resemble heavy metal are ""Until it Sleeps"" and ""Bleeding Me"". The band seems to have all but abandoned their original fan base, and lost their heavy-metal edge in the process. Kirk hammet begins his steady decline on lead guitar. Lars ulrich fails to impress with his slowed down, uninspired cymbal-crashing antics. Jason Newsted steps his performance down a notch as well. If you like commercial-sounding alternative music, give this one a try. If you are a die-hard metal fanatic who lives for the powerful, warp-speed complexity of earlier Metallica albums (Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets), do not consider buying this album until you've heard it."
4,Not as heavy as previous albums but still good.,"Load takes some time to get into but is, by any stretch of the imagination, a great album. Before I heard this album I thought MetallicA could'nt play anything softer than say 'Nothing Else Matters'. That is until I heard 'Mama Said' from this album. It's also heavy with songs like 'Ain't My Bitch' and 'Wasting My Hate'. 'Ronnie' happens to be my favourite."
2,Times Change...,"I am not going to accuse Metallica of ""selling out"" like so many people do. Times change, and people with them. If this is the music they want to play, no one but Metallica can say why that is. I am a big fan of their older albums, especially MOP, and Justice. Their new style of music doesn't appeal to me, but I will go on listening to what I like. Some songs on this album our okay."
1,What Can You Say About Such A Horrible Album?,"How about, ""it's just a bit better than 'Re-load'"". That's not saying much however. This is God-awful musical drek. I used to love this group but now they stink (ever since the Black Album). I didn't even bother with ""Garage, Inc."" and probably won't ever buy another Metallica CD again. Enough is enough! Metallica - R.I.P."
1,"And then, it was over.","Oh how the mighty fall. But we were given plenty of warning this change for the worse was coming - The Black Album with its lack of complex structure and angst-ridden sound was the messenger with very bad news.Load is the point of no return - the point where Metallica completely handed over their identities as a musical tour de force in exchange for a chance to grab 90s grunge fans who were filling Nirvana's coffers. And just like Nirvana, Load completely lacked direction and something relevant to say to mature listeners.Where even the very poor Black Album held at least a few shreds of likeness to the Metallica of yore, Load is a mishmash of grunge, glam rock and blues that doesn't work on any level. Song structures are either boring or completely out of place. Lyrics are almost as laughable as early black metal releases. This is simply not what Metallica was meant to be. And it shows on every riff, every word, and every poor review."
3,"Metallica's worst album, yet its still good.","Metallica was trying new things in this Load/Reload era. Their booklet has some very strange pictures. but i did enjoy these songs: Until It Sleeps, King Nothing (very good song),Bleeding Me, Cure, Poor Twisted Me, Wasting My Hate, Mama Said (cool country Metallica song, one of my favorites on the CD), Thorn Within, and Ronnie."
1,Change can't be good,"I was a huge Metallica fan before they put this huge piece of crap out. It seems that Metallica got enveloped into the trends of today not keeping their metal faith, disappointing a whole legion of metal heads. It's a good thing I can always depend on a band like Pantera never to change. I used to think the same way of Metallica until they released Load. Even for hard rock which they supposedly are now, this music still sucks on the album. If you're going to change Metallica, at least make your music worth the money someone will pay for it."
1,Metallica are the masters of suckosity!!!!!!,"This is one of the biggest sellouts in Heavy Metal history!!! They weren't all that bad in the early to mid 80's, but decided to make commercial crap, that their brainless idiotic fan's eat up like crazy. I want to hear a rebuttal of my review by you blanking idiots!!!! LOAD!!! LOAD OF STEAMING CRAP!!!!!!!!!"
2,Dedication,"This CD is probably just a dedication to Kirk's love for his Wah-Wah pedal. The only song on here that I liked was ""King Nothing."" Then I learned how to play guitar and realized that it's the same riff as ""Enter Sandman."" I'm sure Slayer and Megadeth are really jealous of James' ability to write a great country song, ""Mama Said."" I'm sure Dave Mustaine's first thought after hearing ""Hero of the Day"" was ""Damn, I wish I would have written that riff!"" I can see why it took them 5 years to make. 4 of those years were probably spent solely on the lyrics to ""Ain't my Bitch."" To be honest, just listen to Megadeth, they're so much better."
3,Metallica Prove they are indeed the Hero Of The Day with Loa,"Ok most metallica fans will most probably have this 1996 effort by Metallica somewhere towards the back of their record collection however it would be wrong to dismiss this particular as Crap or rubbish, as far as im concerned it accentuates the fact that Metallica can play in all different genres outside the heavy metal they are expected to lash out every time. Most of the songs on load are far more pensive than the pre 1991 stuff but i think you can link most of the softer songs on this album to songs like Welcome Home (1986) and Fade to Black (1984)which were pre 1991, so Metallica fans should stop complaining about this album because so of the more thoughtful songs on this album are more similer to some of the better stuff then most people think"
5,King Everything!,"I know that people have changed their mind about Metallica, but you shouldn't. They still rule!!! I must admit their older albums are a little better, but they're still cool. Every good(best,coolest ect.) band has a bad album. And let me tell you something... Metallica hasen't made it yet!!!!"
4,A step in a different direction,"Although I would like to call myself a Metallica ""purest"" I disagree with that group in that this was a terrible album. I love old Metallica, their fast paced headbanging anthems and screaming guitar solos, but the fact is this album is not as bad as other fans would have you think. While it is far from what we usually think of as Metallica, it's still not that bad. When you listen to it, you need to not think of it as thrash like their old stuff. This is modern rock, more alike to Nirvana, Staind, Creed and Stone Temple Pilots than Slayer and Megadeth which their old stuff was like. When you listen to it that way, it's pretty good, just don't think about the other cds while you listen. This an album you should get and listen to while you read a book. It's great music to listen to while reading, but if you're really going to listen, go with Master of Puppets or RIde the Lightning."
2,A Disappointment,"A followup of the aclaimed 'Black Album,' arguably Metallica's best studio effort to date, Load does nothing but disappoint. It deviates from everything that one has come to expect from Metallica. The songs like Hero of the Day and Mama Said make you squirm because of the lack of everything that is Metallica from the thunderous guitar riffs to Hetfield's vocals. The only song that seems to belong to Metallica (and at the same time doesn't belong on this album, is King Nothing,) which shows why Metallica is the best at what they do."
4,rocks!,"ok people stop bashing metallica for changing their music.....there is nothing wrong with this cd....which i thoroughly enjoyed. sure its not as good as the black album but metallica is still heavy and this cd is a little darker and meaner than some of their previous work. until it sleeps,king nothing,hero of the day , bleeding me are very good songs.i think its good metallics changed directiomn in their music a little and if u r a really big metallica fan u wont notice the change that much."
2,Total Sellout,"Mettalica has sold out. The only reason I gave it two stars was I like only ONE SONG it is ""wasting my hate"". They have lost all song writing capabilities and their speed."
3,Some good songs,"Many of the songs seemed good at first, but I tired of them after a while. Still, I just love ""Bleeding Me"", and can listen to it all day, even if it's not ""classic"" Metallica."
2,"Excuse me, I wasn't finished.","Hi, Pisser here. Once again Censorzon.com decides to leave out a key part of my review. What they took out besides a choice name I gave this band was my question (which was in the title of my review) of how that Danny metalhead guy below me gave this album a score of 3 short of perfect? There were 14 songs, so that would be 140 points, not 100. Well, I guess it was a mistake.Thanks a f**king lot, Fraudazon, for snipping out bits of reviews you don't agree with.2 stars for the album and 0 stars for Assazon's review system."
1,LOAD...,"DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY. BUY THEIR PRE SELLOUT ALBUMS, KILL EM ALL, RIDE THE LIGHTNING, MASTER OF PUPPETS, AND AND JUSTICE FOR ALL."
2,"Very different Metallica, but not THE greatest","I dont know why so many people say that this is one of, if not THE best album from the band. Lets be honest, its ok for a band to change, like most of you said, it becomes boring when a band keeps playing the same thing over the years (like Iced Earth and many others), but hey, this album stands very LOW compared to the first four albums. Ok, there are some new nice things to hear (like Poor Twisted Me and Until It Sleeps), the mayority of the songs simply...!!!This is not like other bands (like Dream Theater, Opeth, Dark Tranquillity, or even In Flames) that change their style, but keep writing strong different material that keep their respective genre growing! If you listen to this album, it completely stands off from what they are supposed to be playing. Look at the Justice album for example, its so different from the first three, setting the direction for a whole prog, trashy, very tecnical thing! Instead, they ... wrote the Black Album!"
5,"Complex, hard, heavy","I beleive Metallica's Load is, along with it's sister album ReLoad, the single most awesome piece of modern metal in existance. With this album's intense sound and thoughtful lyrics, Metallica has once again redefined the field of rock and roll. Unquestionably, an indespensible album in any true rock fan's collection."
5,One of the best ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I totally recommend this cd. It rocks! The only thing that other people do not like about it is that the group cut their hair and quite drinking all the d*mn time! I think that this and the BLACK ALBUM is the best out there. OK, so they got a little softer on this cd, but it is still the best one they have put out!"
2,Metallica-Load- A Load of Garbarge. Sadly no Longer the Metallica of Old.,"Sometimes , the times change, and change for the worst, Load, Was a Load of *!*% sadly. a good song here or there. and yes acoustic was good, but really growing up On Master Of Puppets ,And Justice..And Black Album Tapes... Then this comes .. Made me sad, To top it off, the haircuts which were probably needed added more, and then much later the napster ordeal. made me Mad at Metallica. I now occasionally listen to them,the old stuff, maybe st.anger. Which Was better than this. But Buy their stuff again not sure. Aww those good Old Days 93-97 in Middle School listening TO Metallica, Danzig, Misfits, And Samhain.(I have Metallica to thank for Intro to the others)."
3,i love metallica but...,"metallica will always be one of the greatest bands of all time no matter what ppl say. and just like every other band, even the greatest band is bound to have ups and downs. so what this album is not as great as the black album or master of puppets? it's still pretty darn good! what ppl need to realize is that it's not the 80s anymore and no matter how metallica wants to stick to writing the way they used to write when they were in their 20s, it's just not goin to be the same.instead, old fans tend to hate on this album w/o really givin it a chance. i don't like it as much as the black album but that's okay b/c this is still a decent CD. while some of the songs are...uh...let's not talk about that...others are quite good if u keep an open mind. ain't my bitch and outlaw are pretty good even tho they both lack that charisma metallica used to have.hey, it's at least better than 2003's ""st.anger""! so do give it a chance"
2,I couldn't think of a better title...,"I'm not going to poo all over Metallica because they deserve a lot of respect for what they did in the 80's. How ever, I will fart in there general direction for everything they've done since 91, this album included. It is not very metal. It's more like Young Bob Segar on crack. It doesn't inspire me to bang my head, kill my parents, start doing drugs and worshipping the devil like metal is SUPPOSED to do. No, it makes me want to listen to FM radio and sing along with Lit, SUM 41 and Blink 182. At least those bands are consistant. This CD is not worth your time if you are a fan of Master, Ride, Kill or Justice. But if you're a fan of those you already know that."
1,"Successful College Writing: Skills, Strategies, Learning S","After reading and studying this book, you will end up with excessive confusion because this book not only provides unfocused and unclear information, but its overloaded comments and examples make the original explanation seem more difficult to understand."
4,Good book,"This book has really grown on me. I would give it five stars but it took a while to get into it. It consists of 92 two or three page chapters with titles like ""The Seeking Curse"" and ""Who Creates All the Thoughts?"".At first it seemed too dry and mechanical like some of Balsekar's books do. At other times too clever like Wei Wu Wei. But I'm about to read the final chapter called ""Journey's End"" and I have to say it's a good book."
1,i have been duped,"I read all the reviews and felt pretty comfortable buying the game. We played it for exactly 30 minutes and could not figure out what everyone else found to be fun about the game. It was soooooo much worse than the WII game. My daughter and I mastered the cardio dance (which really wasnt dancing - more like some kind of cheerleading movements) within minutes. We did a couple other exercises- none that were anything to write home about. The scenery was kind of cheesy, the music (or lack thereof) was horrible, and we hardly broke a sweat doing the exercises that we like. In a word- BORING. I will take WII Fit over this product anyday."
1,HUGE WASTE OF MONEY,This was the worst video game and waste of money yet. HATED it. half the time the nunchunk in the strap doesn't register. The other half the time the punches in the boxing don't register. I WANT MY MONEY BACK. HORRIBLE
4,lets active,"This game ( product) does what I thought the Wii Fit was going to do. These are challenging workouts, often feel sore afterwards from muscles I don't use often. I do have one complaint: sometimes it doesn't detect your motion so your atavar doesn't move and the game chastises you. Other than that I love it, well worth the money."
2,Close but no cigar,"My wife and I bought this game after tearing through Wii fit and Gold's Gym Cardio. At first it seemed pretty promising. But within a week both bands broke, so we went out and bought bungee style bands...which is fine except holding both the band handles and the wiimote is a bit difficult. Especially with how sensitive this game is to the direction and orientation of your wiimote.But the biggest pain (literally) is the fact that every single time we did alternating lunges, reverse lunges, or jump lunges, the game would hold us longer on our left leg than our right. I'm talking like 3 seconds longer each time. We ended up just holding our right lunges an extra 3 seconds so we didn't end up all lopsided with one gigantic leg and one normal sized leg.My wife also had so much trouble getting the game to recognize her movements that she finally gave up on the game completely."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent workout. I have exercised consistently most of my life and found this program to be fantastic. In my opinion, customizing the workouts is the best option. I created a 30 minute workout that was a superior overall body workout. I highly recommend this item."
4,Great workout,"I have now gone through 7 workouts in the 30-day challenge. So far, I'm quite pleased with the variety and intensity of the workouts. I have read through some of the very negative reviews listed for this product, and am not sure why they are having problems. The only ""glitch"" I have encountered is during the running exercises. Sometimes it doesn't seem to register the intensity of my running and lists the running as ""too slow."" As for the other exercises, if the Wii doesn't register one of my movements, it is usually due to my not holding the remotes correctly."
5,Getting Active,"This is better than the Wii fit in my opinion in that it is less of a ""game"" and easier to move from exercise to exercise without having to stop and score each time. I got quite a good workout. I have not yet had a chance to try out every aspect of the program, but so far so good."
1,Nun chuck Awkward,"I wanted to diversify from Wii fit and play a fitness game with my daughter. First thing I noticed is that even in two player mode you are required to strap the nun-chuck to your thigh. We have two nun chucks but the game only comes with one thigh strap - not something one would get extras of. So after getting irritated me and daughter started skipping all nun-chuck thigh exercises which ruined the workout.But even trying it alone I found the nun-chuck as used in this game annoying, I would be hit by the wire, have movement restricted by the wire or the whole strap and numchuck fall off my leg.In short I am still looking for a game to supplement Wii Fit Plus."
4,Active exercise program,"I got this program because I needed some variety in my exercises. I have the Wii Fit and Wii Fit plus and liked those. The Active is good, really gets you going and it's fun. The only thing I don't like is once you know how to do each exercise I wish they didn't have the tutorials come up each time, I would rather just go from one exercise to the other without having to click through the tutorials.Otherwise, it's a good program. At least it gets me up off the sofa."
2,Fitness Game,I found that the exercise routines were going to slow for my needs. I found myself waiting for the computerized instructor too much and too often. I dont think that this type of fitness program is for me. I can't get motivated to do this type of exercise at home and alone. I'd rather play racquet ball or tennis or some type of out door sport. Just not for me.....
3,Good but not great,This game was obviously made for tiny people who are already fit. I am not. The leg band is very small and wouldn't stay on. I do like the extra exercises it provides.
5,LOVE IT!!!!,"I absolutaly love this game!!Pros:Counts how many calories youe are burning.Tons of fun sport games, and cardio (I thought the most creative sports were inline skating, basket ball and volley ball and i love v. ball so this is beyond fun for me, and you dont find these sports in most fitness games)!Easy to use, and very clear what to do and when to do it.Its just an awesome game and you want to go in and use it whenever you can!Cons:Leg strap does fall down, but if you put it as high as you can on your leg, it will stay..at least for me.Sometimes, it doesnt sense what your movements are, maybe if your going to fast, but if you follow the trainer it will overall sense it.I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to be fit and have fun in the comfort of your home."
1,Not good for bad knees,"I received a lot of positive feedback from friends but it would not register my leg exercises unless I bent my knees, beyond 90 degrees. It could just be me, but Wii active did not work for my knees."
3,"Too Easy, Geared for Beginners","This is a good buy if you are a beginner looking to get into a fitness routine, but does not even begin to challenge me. I would say I am moderately in shape. (I do 5 hours of cardio and 2 hours of weight training a week.) If you are already in shape, this system will not challenge you. I would suggest purchasing a tougher resistance band separately as the one included is way too easy (regardless of how far in you put the handles). Great for a beginner or just as something fun to pass time, but not a supplement for those already in a workout program."
5,A good workout!,"Short and sweet, this game is actually a workout. We love playing with our Wii Fit, but truly that is more game fun. This is a workout. I wasn't paying attention apparently that the leg strap should go on your right leg, and so the game was not reading what I was doing! I finally got it, aha, and it worked then! Silly me. As long as you have the leg strap on the correct leg, and the nunchuk facing the correct way, you are good to go! My legs were definitely sore the next day. I highly recommend going with the 30 day challenge. It keeps you on track, and if you don't have a lot of time to play around with the settings, it will create a program for you. Worth every penny."
1,Great Idea but The Game Doesn't Work,"This is a great idea and it does work up a great sweat but I'm extremely frustrated with it. I KNOW how to do squats, lunges and jumps with great form but this game frequently doesn't recognize that I'm even moving. I've readjusted the leg strap and nunchuck 100 different ways and it doesn't make a difference. Looks like a lot of people have had this problem. I cannot believe the software engineers didn't do something about this or create a work around of some kind (like allowing you to push ""A"" when your at the bottom of your lunge and then B at the top or something to override the sensors since they don't work.I've even tried just giving it a little shake or moving the nunchuck up and down myself but it doesn't matter. This game would be a lot of fun if I didn't have to ""skip"" pieces of the workout because it doesn't see that I've done them. Honestly I wish I had not spent the money on it."
4,Needs more variety,"Having never used a video game to get in a workout, I have to admit, I really like this game. It's a fun experience and I hope this is just the beginning stages of this kind of product and that in the future we will see more graphically sophisticated games created.My only issue is that I would have liked more variety when it came to the activities. I don't like dancing, tennis or basketball. I found the skateboarding challenge hard on my knees. I also don't even bother with the upper body exercises because you just can't get an effective workout. So, that leaves me with track, boxing and lower body. All good, but I want more. Hopefully they will add more in future versions."
3,Too many bugs,"I am currently doing the 30 day workout challenge with this ""game"". I would give it a higher rating except for a couple of issues. Some of the exercises ""stick"". Even though I am doing them correctly, they just won't register. When I do the kick-ups and am supposed to speed up, it doesn't register that I am going faster. I thought he icon for me would reflect what I'm doing, but that isn't the case. This morning, I forgot to remove the numchuk from the holder and the game registered me as doing a rep. My other gripe is that there are no exercises for strengthening the legs beyond squats and lunges. My weakness is my lower body and this is disappointing for that. I also wish it had more of the sports activities in the 30 day workout."
2,No too impressed,"Ok, Im really shocked at how much others love this game. I was bored within the first 3-4 workouts. Im not by any means a workout pro but I felt this program was too slow for me. I just got it 3 days ago and will continue to give it a chance, but as for now Im thinking about returning it and just continue to hit the gym!"
2,Thumbs Down,"I wish I had been bright enough to wait for the reviews before I bought this, but I was very eager to begin a new fitness routine. I had high hopes for this one! However, like many other reviewers, I've found it nearly impossible to use. Maybe I'm just a complete moron, but no matter what adjustments I make it rarely registers my movements. I've also had trouble with the leg strap staying up, and I find it very awkward to have to worry about two different controllers while I'm trying to work out. I think the concept of the game could be good if it worked properly for all users, but it needs a lot of improvements."
2,"Needs a restart button, kept freezing up!","I really enjoyed this product at first, got through the fourth workout in the 30 day challenge and it just started acting up. It would tell me to position the nunchuk and Wii remote, so I would and it would never restart! I workout in the mornings before work, I just don't have time for that kind of thing. I ended up making my own workouts and that seems to be working for now but I am looking for something that continues to work for me. I will still try to give it a chance but if you are on a time crunch, pray that you get the whole workout exactly right and don't have to reboot the software."
4,Workin' well,"I had always wanted a cardio/lifting exercise program that would work me out and also be fun. I knew when the Wii came out that it was only going to be a matter of time before a game company did a fitness game right. And Active is it. My wedding is coming up in less than three months, and I've been using the 30 day challenge on medium to tone up. I'm almost done with the challenge and my arms definitely feel firmer. I'm taking away a star because the wiimote to nun-chuck cable sometimes gets in my way and the sensor doesn't always seem to detect some of the upper body reps immediately. This game would be even better if there were abdominal exercises, but it looks like the announced sequel will address that."
2,I didn't believe reviews about motion not being sensed,...and that is exactly what happened. I would jump...the game wouldn't register it and just sat there waiting for me to jump. Not very fun at all. Or productive.
4,Good workout and encouraging!,"I have to say I thought that I wasn't going to like this exercise ""game"" but I found I really like it and am getting stronger and more svelte. My boyfriend thinks that it is sort of funny that I like to work out inside with the wii but oh well, right?"
2,"A lot of do this do that, not so much fun","This is a very personal trainer type of game -- you are told to do this and do that, for a dozen exercise... i know, if I can do them, I will be fit, but since it is not so fun, if I have the discipline to stick to this training, I can also go biking and do weights every other day, and that gave me fantastic results too.Maybe because I am a guy, I don't like to be told to do this and do that repeatedly. I would rather play the games on Wii Fit Plus, because it is fun, I need no other incentive to play it. And any exercise for 30 minutes a day can make me fit. Maybe the ""specialized"" training can have better results, but if it is not fun, then I won't do it, and there won't even be any result."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be...,"I had high hopes for this game since it was produced by EA but sadly after 3 days of game play, I'm not that impressed. The exercises and stretches are ok but the motion control isn't that good. I still can't seem to get the squats to work. While the exercises are ok, the ""sports"" games are really not that fun. They're actually kind of boring and repetitive. Once again, the motion control isn't that good on the sports games like volleyball. In addition, you try to hit these targets on a lot of sports games and no matter how bad your form is, you always seems to hit the targets.One big problem that other people have mentioned is that the leg strap keeps falling down. My gf is skinny and even with the adjustment strip, it still falls down.Overall, if you are new to exercising and need some motivation to do some easy exercises, the game is worth a try but if you have already had experience in exercising, then this game is actually a bit frustrating."
3,Too robotic,"I found this workout painfully robotic. You have to stop between reps or the instructor yells at you. I'm used to fluid, constant motion. Also, it takes a while to figure out what they want on certain exercises. It would help if the instructor could say what was wrong, rather than just ""you're not working hard enough."" For example, on the rollerblading (which I actually liked) I was jumping at the beginning of the ramp instead of the end which the instructor didn't like, but didn't say how to do it better. I've just gotten Jillian Michaels 2010 which seems a bit better."
3,A little overblown,"Yes a very complete guide, but a little over the top. reads like ""the Hobbit"" in places. More of mediocre prose than a hiking guide. With so many Smokies guides out there guess you have to be different. Quite short on facts on off trail routes...this is a shortcoming."
5,Indispensable!,"I regard this book as an indispensable and practical tool for personal leadership development. Quite often, we get or give 360 feedback where a growth opportunity is evidenced. This book not only reviews each area of skills, but more importantly provides valuable examples that actually drive change!"
2,It doesn't stretch as described.,"To give the pros first. As a 5ft hose it is fine. It's flexable and the fittings are solid. The finish is bright and sturdy and I believe it would last. It's better made than many of the 60"" hoses near the same price.Cons. It does stretch, but not nearly to the extent advertised. I get about 10-12"" Maximum. That's wrapping it around my back and giving it the effort it would take to do a push up. I would compare it to trying to stretch a heavy duty bike inner tube. Putting that much pressure to stretch it that far on your shower plumbing would probably damage the shower.If you need a longer than 60"" hose, buy one that is longer."
5,out for justice,"I was just happy to find this movie soundtrack; I will be purchasing the movie on dvd; If you like different kinds of music, you must watch the movie and then you will appreciate the sndtrk..."
2,Disappointing,I received this item as a Christmas gift after putting it on my wish list. I'm very disappointed because the colors are so light. Online the colors look fairly rich but in person they are almost nonexistent. Definitely not worth the money.
5,very pretty earrings,These earrings really sparkle and the colors are ones I wear often. I would definitely purchase again from this seller.
3,Not as vivid as pictured.,"I was a little disappointed in these earrings. Their colors are much more subtle than the picture suggests and to tell you the truth, I think they look like plastic. They're pretty and I will still wear them, but they don't look nearly as nice in person as they do in the their picture."
5,Good,"Good product, looks nice and I gave it away as a Christmas gift so I can't say how it performed."
2,Seriously? These are plastic...,I thought these were going to be made of stone. These feel and look like plastic beads. I wish I had spent my money on something nicer from a craft fair.
2,Looked great in the picture...,"These looked great in the picture, but when I got them I was disappointed. There's not as sparkly and bright as I had thought they would be. They just look like plastic beads on a wire. The return policy from the store I bought them from was such that it would have cost too much in postage and fees to make it worth returning."
4,World's Fair Review,"The greatest aspect of World's Fair is the way in which it captures the 1930s, balancing a strong feeling of nostalgia that makes the novel very enjoyable with economic and social realism. The 1930s are preserved as a cherished memory as lived by real people and poignant social realism.Doctorow manages to write from the perspective of a child in a way that is enjoyable and believable. The world of 1930s New York grows along with Edgar, opening new possibilities and dangers to the growing boy.Bottom Line: There is really something magical about the way Doctorow captures 1930s New York."
4,A Fair World's Fair,"Like a great painting, Doctorow choses his words carefully, depicting the 30s as the dark, mournful era that it was. Written well with the usual description that Doctorow is famous for, I have to say that the synopsis made the book sound more exciting.The book details the experience that the protagonist and his family have while at the World's Fair in New York City. From the oddities to the fun, Doctorow did his research and what was there. Unlike his other books like Loon Lake or Welcome to Hard Times, I did not feel I was there, at the fair.Displaying the 30s like it was, this book proves and depicts how far we have come since then. In the primitive times of tea-line-legged nylons and T&A was unheard of, historians and fans of Doctorow will be pleased. I applaud him for his historical essence and truthfulness . . . the excitement factor just was not there."
5,Great buy!,Best price on combo tv/ dvd / perfect for my our 7 yr. old. ....4 out of 5 stars on picture quality ......no more wires to mess with. Great space saver too. E/bay has great price on swivel mounts that extend.....around $ 30 or $ 40 bucks!Gotta love the $400 savings on this T.V.!
1,Disappointed,This is not a soundtrack. It is a score of background music from the movie. Very disappointed and not worth it. There are only 2 actual songs. What a great movie could have done a better soundtrack....especially for us BRIDES :) Save your money for the wedding girls!!
4,Beautiful music,"Father of the Bride is one of my favourite movies, and I also love the music. It is mostly ""background"" music and it's very relaxing and beautiful to listen to. However, I agree with one of the other comments that mentioned the lack of the other songs. I wish it had My Girl, The Boy I'm Gonna Marry, and Chapel of Love among others. That would have made it just perfect."
4,"Useful, could be better","I have a few problems with this otherwise useful book. Not all of the colors in the photos are true; when the caption says ""turquoise and lavender"" and the picture shows green and pink, there is something amiss. This kind of color misprint occurs in several of the photos. Don't depend on the photos for accurate period colors! Also, most of the bathrooms shown in the photos are large! Many bungalows were small with small bathrooms. It would be nice, and useful too, to have some pictures of dinky bungalow bathrooms. Also, I like at least a few floor plans. Photos don't always give you an accurate idea of the actual layout and dimensions. I admit that I am jealous of almost every one of the bathrooms shown. My 1930 bungalow has one small low-end original bath (if it ever had tile, it's long gone) and one minimal 3/4 bath added in the 1950s."
5,Absorbing family drama,This wonderful film tells a story of a French Canadian family with five very different sons. Zac is the central character and his relationship to his headstrong father and his painful efforts to fit in while discovering his true nature make for a great film. When you see the film you will understand the meaning of the title. Highly recommended.
1,NEVER RECEIVED THIS ITEM,I AM STILL WAITING TO RECEIVE MY ITEM. SO I COULDN'T POSSIBLY RATE SOMETHING I DON'T HAVE. EXCEPT TO SAY THAT ITS TAKEN WAY TOO LONG TO RECEIVE.
5,The best book for teens I've ever read!,"Working as a health and sexuality educator in Miami, as well as being a mother of three, this book delivers the information teens really want to know in a way that is understandable and interesting to them. Another big plus is that this book has the most illustrations of any other book on the subject, which holds my students and teens attention as well. I always recommend this book to the staff personnel, teachers, parents and students I meet at the health facilities and schools I visit. This truly is an invaluable handbook!"
5,A new Block fan!!,"This was my first ever Lawrence Block book and it certainly wont be the last! Its was fun, funny and easy to read. I loved the cast of charactors and Bernie would now be my favourite heroCant wait to get my hands on more of this series!!"
3,"First Burglar, second Block","This is the first book I've read in the Bernie Rhodenbarr series, and the second Lawrence Block book I've read. I have to say that reading this was a hoot. Block has an interesting writing style and it really stands out from other authors. Whatever fault you may find with the plot, the dialogue and humorous incidents certainly make up for it.Many reviewers say that this is one of the weaker novels in the Burglar series, and I hope that's true. If it is, this reader's in a for a treat in reading the others.3/5 stars"
2,keyboard terrible,We purchased two of these computers and they are both the same. The keyboards are very hard to use. You have to hold the fingers almost 90 degrees to get the keys to work. I end up typing a message and then have to go through and fill in all the letters that the keyboard did not type. I sent mine back and got a Fujitsu it is great
5,A realistic romance,"This is an extraordinary movie, full of small moments and a sweet sense of promise. It manages to convey the growing attraction between the two main characters without delving into the bag of Hollywood cliches. The relationship that develops is realistically complicated, and doesn't take the shopworn path to a happy ending.The music is also fantastic, and all the more appealing because it was written and performed by the principal players, not in bombastic musical-theater style, but organically within the course of the story.It's a beautiful film that will stick with you and hold up to repeat viewing."
5,I adore this film!,"I can't really add anything to the 200+ reviews. But I will say that this movie has heart, passion and a nontraditional romance that left me in tears. If you have a passion for music, this is definitely worth seeing.EDIT 6/20/08 - I just saw the Swell Season Concert in Chicago a few days ago and it was by far the best concert I'v ever been to. Even if you don't love the film, you need to see the group live, they are amazing! Can't wait till the come back."
1,Are you all nuts?,"What an awful, amateurish, unwatchable video. Aside from the bad singing, bad songs and unintelligible accents, there were the uninteresting characters and the jerky hand-held camera used throughout.I frequently buy books and movies that seem interesting and have good user reviews. As I like musicals and this is five-star rated, it seemed like a no-brainer. What a mistake! Maybe the film makers have nothing better to do with their time than to post fake reviews. From now on I'm going to be more suspicious of high ratings that don't correspond to box-office success."
1,ONCE,"This film ""Once"" has got to be one of the worst that I have viewed in years! How John Carney, the writer/director was ever able to get this out into the market for sale, I do not know. It is absolute trash and the players are terrible. Thus music is absolute garbage.....far too loud and ""grating"" on the nerves! Need I say more....or less.I have two options: Ask for a refund, or throw this DVD of ""Once"" right into the garbage!"
1,Tis was terrible,I wish I had opportunity to view this movie before purchasing - never would've bought it. I rely on user reviews. I was stung this time. I didn't see any story line and the music is not that good. Chalk this up to a lesson learned. I'll be lucky if I can give it away.
3,Musical is better!,"Although I LOVED the musical, the movie is a little slower in pace and didn't leave me feeling as inspired."
5,Greatest movie ever?,"I just received my Once Blu Ray in Utah, and the picture quality is incredible, byt the audio is even better. I LOVE THIS MOVIE, and having the blu ray completes my life. Thanks to those across the Atlantic who made this possible, and super affordable."
4,This movie was an interesting study of 2 people's search for their life goals.,"The characters were interesting and their stories typical of ""real"" people who get into a ""slump"" in life. Their stories were intertwined in a realistic manner."
1,A real bad musical,If you want to hear some bad singing that seems to go on for ever then this is the movie for you. Who knew that this was going to be a musical about two disfunctional people?
1,Boring movie,We visit Ireland so I wanted videos that include places in Ireland. I could't get to the scenery because the acting was so boring and story line so slow. I turned it off and gave the movie to my son.
5,movie for anyone with a passion for music,"If you have a passion for music, this movie will strum your heartstrings. I felt so moved by the pure, deep, complicated friendship between the two main characters, Glen and Mar--a friendship born of musical passion, but restrained by integrity and virtue. And the music! I bought both the CD and the DVD, and even wrote my own song, prompted by the movie! Don't miss this movie, fine for all ages."
1,Caveat emptor: buyer beware!,"Bought via Amazon in the UK -- a mere 54 (about US$95). The viewing program will not install on a top-range IBM ThinkPad; attempting installation repeatedly crashes the computer. Who would not deeply respect the past directors who authorized the content of this distinguished magazine? Who would not scorn whoever in the present management has authorized this contemptibly shoddy presentation? So-called ""customer service"" does not condescend to reply to e-mails. I am amazed at the number of reviewers who are almost eager to put up with such a slip-shod package of goods! Return for a refund, if possible; otherwise, you have got yourself 8 shiny coasters for coffee cups -- for only 54."
3,Not Windows 8 compatible,THIS ITEM IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS 8. This is nothing against the seller. She was not aware of it. This set works via a software program only. You cannot view issues outside the software. Please be aware before purchasing.
1,buyer beware,"After the program wouldn't install at all on the first two computers I tried it on, I finally managed to install it on a third, after five tries or so. However, not only did the program still not work, it completely crashed the computer. As in full system recovery crashed. Two of the three computers I'm talking about are less then six months old, high-end machines. So after several hours of attempting to use this product, score is computers destroyed: 1, New Yorker articles read: 0.Maybe I just got a defective product, but you've been warned."
5,Love the content - wish it was in a more user-friendly form,"My star rating is based on having at my disposal all of these wonderful articles. I enjoy being able to type in seemingly random topics and having so many readings to choose from.Be warned, because of the technology, you are committed to having all of the discs available at all times to read up on your interests. Also, some of the older articles have very small fonts, making it difficult to read on screen. I hope newer versions make navigation and reading easier."
4,Software a Pain,"If it weren't for the softwre, I would still be celebrating the release of this archive. In the nearly two weeks I have owned it, I have given up radio, TV, shopping, showering and my now decamped SO to browse 80 years of stellar American writing.Too bad 40% of that time was waiting for the next article to appear, for the search engine to stop, or for a hang-up to clear that often never would.The comment about the Abstracts was dead-on. I sense they off-shored this task to bright but over worked foreigners whose English skills often aren't broad enough to get the joke. Or the subtlety. Or the wit. Worse, they spell only as well as I do...So, one star off for these disappointments, but if you love The New Yorker, you will find a way around every problem you encounter, including the puzzling disappearence of the February 20, 1989 issue."
2,Software Update?,"I own a version of this set that I purchased when the set was originally released. Recently I installed the software on my Mac only to learn that it cannot run because the software supports only PowerPC (old) Mac operating systems. I cannot find an updated version of the software for download anywhere.This seems like poor support for the product.Low marks also go for ease of use (switching DVDs), crappy interface (slow, inflexible), poor resolution (print out an article and it's very fuzzy), spyware (as documented elsewhere, the software permits monitoring of all sorts of activities).Incidentally, if anyone knows where to find the updated software please indicate!Thx"
1,Give up my Privacy rights?,"After reading below about the spyware that this product would place on my computer and how I would have to give up my privacy rights, I have decided to vote with my feet and not buy this product.

1,computer mess,Do not install this. It will do things to your computer that you do not want. We had to remove it. The New Yorker should stick to selling things they understand.
4,"Score (Like Film) is Sudsy, Histrionic, Danceable Treat","""Soapdish"" is hands-down the funniest American movie of the 1990s. Infallibly. Still, I WILL concede that whether or not this is the greatest American comedy SOUNDTRACK of the 1990s is perhaps (PERHAPS) up for debate. Even if it IS surpassed (which has yet to be established) by another score, you nonetheless won't regret having a listen to these brassy, latin-influenced, no-holds-barred orchestrations. They truly capture the irreverent, lunatic essence of the movie and get you cha-cha-cha-ing. It's a soundtrack guaranteed to pep up any gathering and cure even the deepest of operatic malaises. When Sally Field rants in the greatest scene in film comedy history: ""And now you're all back! And I've ruined three lives! THREE LIVES! ME! America's Sweetheart!"", satirical melodrama simply doesn't get any better than this. You'll likewise be hard put to find any better comedy soundtrack made in the past twenty years."
3,A tale of two halves,"The Bottom Line:The first half of the film--with the expection of the director's infatuation with splitting the screen--works well, as the Henry Fonda-led police try to apprehend the notorious Boston Strangler (Tony Curtis); however, as the topic of the movie shifts to pyschobabbling attempts to unlock Curtis's split personality, the movie takes a turn for the boring and emerges as a film you really don't need to spend time or money on."
4,This pillow is too small for tall,"I'm 6'2"" tall, so this pillow, while being soft, is too small for me get comfortable. Perhaps if I was just a few inches shorter, it would be perfect. My cat loves it, though!"
1,Cheap and flimsy,"They were cheap so I didn't expect much but I was hoping that they would actually stand up which they don't, no matter how full or empty they are. Don't waste your time on these."
3,Not bad...,"These are cool because they are easy to set up and they are cute because they have the little label spaces on the front. That said, they are a bit flimsy. I ordered another set that's a thick cardboard and I like them much better, but if you are just going to have them sitting on bookshelves full of magazines, they'll do."
4,Nice for the money,"Very durable, a little bit overly flexible and must be set next to one another or next to a book etc so they won't fall over or twist too much."
1,Helpful if they could stand up,"I'm not a product review person, but I really wish I had read the other reviews before buying this. They are completely usless as they will not stand up and hold a form. Even with books on either side, it still sways. Great colors, but the company should have seen this coming. Was going to return it, but the shipping cost more than the product."
3,Toy Rodimus Prime,I am collector of optimus prime transformers and I am very happy that they came out with re-issues. I am only disappointed in the packaging of Hasbro though. I know Takara and Hasbro are the ones bringing these reissues out but Takara's packaging is better than Hasbro. I wish Hasbro has done the same thing as Takara.
5,Where is she now,Hi I am Linda's Brother and it's great to see all the rave reveiws about Linda's work. She is currently recording new material (and believe me it sounds great) Currently living in Surrey (UK) and doing fine. I think Lark is one of her best recordings. Check out the Web site (...)
3,Helpful,"I thought this book was helpful for what I needed, but didn't get much use out of most of the games. I was searching for games for VBS & most of the games were geared toward on going learning. If you are a Sunday School teacher looking for ideas, this book could be extremely useful."
4,Love her voice,"I'm always looking for new & great female vocalists to listen to (this is mostly due to me wanting to sing along and pretend I'm actually the singer I always wanted to be....), and have found another one in Jonatha Brooke. She has a distinct and sincere style and is not trite or over produced. There is some definite emotion behind her voice and lyrics -- which is such a refreshing thing to find these days. I recommend giving this album a listen....you'll be hooked."
3,Falling In,"Jonatha Brooke's music reminds me of a virgin version of Ani Difranco, both sharing that unique ""whinney"" sound... Some one wrote in another review that her high notes where sharp and shrill. I wouldn't say shrill. ""Whinney"". But Jonatha's voice also reminds me of an impressionist at times of Sinead O'Connor. The tones, the key changes, all very light yet over flowing. She is much better singing lower toned as well as slower paced music for her voice. The higher the note.. her voice breaks into nothing but air, not a full sound. If she wants to be the next Brittney ..keep on with the airy sound.. if not.. follow your low tones... Lows also tend to feed on the emotion more. Overall, shes got one hell of a voice, she just needs some polishing...."
5,This is a great foot!!!!,The Brother SA146 Open Toe Foot is useful for machine Applique and sewing where you need to see your work for exact stitch placement... I think it would also be useful for couching stitches. It is sturdy and easy ti attach.. I highly recommend this foot!!!
2,Basic,"Each craft comes with a list of needed materials--very good. I see this as a basic 'how-to' for untrained crafters/high school wedding party on the cheap. If you think of changing some of the ideas for prom night, the real customer for this book is a high school junior"
3,show horse,"In this book, the Saddle Club is excited about an upcoming A-rated horse show. Lisa decides to enter Prancer, a green ex-racehorse. First of all, the blame shouldn't fall on Lisa for the fiasco that results. It is Max's fault. You don't put a rider and a horse in a situation that could get them or another person badly hurt simply to teach the rider a lesson. That's just dangerous and irresponsible. It's not very helpful to tell the rider allegorical stories about being ready after he or she has been humiliated in the show ring, and another person almost seriously injured by that rider's horse."
4,Not bad,"Its much better than I thought. It has song from the first predator movie. Most of the songs have a nice carribean beat into the songs. It gets tiring after the seventh song though. The best songs are Main Title,Tunnel Chase,Danny Gets It,This Is History and End Title . The rest of the songs were lame."
3,Disappointed...,"I love Judith Ivey's voice, but as a narrator, I found it to be lacking. It was difficult for me to distinguish between characters, and it droned on, and on, and on....And Karin Slaughter is one of my favorite authors, mostly because I like the gore in her books. Its realistic. But to have it available only in abridged is AWFUL. Although with Ivey reading it, atleast it makes the story shorter.It was boring, and reminded me of being back in high school and being forced to listen to my teacher destroy books by reading them out loud. I found myself falling asleep while I listened to the first cd.Save your money. Buy an audiobook that atleast drums up some excitement."
1,Blindsighted,I am not in the habit of reviewing books that I read. I read for my own enjoyment and do not share my. Thoughts with other
2,A great read - but a mile-wide plot hole (spoiler alert !),"Yes, this is a great read, provided you're prepared not to think too much about it. Pretty graphic, shocking and fast-paced. BUT (spoiler-alert) we find out at the end that the very first rape scene is almost identical to what happened to Sara, and ... she doesn't happen to mention that at the time ? Would you not think someone as intelligent as her might have gone ""whoa - perhaps there's a connection ?"". But I guess that would have made for a much shorter book ..."
5,Brilliant,"It's a long time since I started a book and couldn't put it down. This book ticks all the boxes, it grabbed me from the beginning. At times it's a little graphic but this does not take from it, great read."
4,Amazing,"Amazing first book from Karin Slaughter. Her characters Dr Sara Linton, medical examiner & Pediatrician, & Chief of Police Jeffrey Tolliver find themselves dealing with a very bloody, devious and crazy rapist & killer in their small town of Heartsdale, Georgia. Sara finds Sibyl Adams, a local College Professor, raped & stabbed in the local diner. Unfortunately Sibyl will not be the only victim in their small town. A very gripping story that kept me shocked but hooked until the end."
2,Very Mediocre. What's all the fuss.,"I found this book very run of the mill. Characters were fairly two dimensional, plot was fairly plodding. Not awful, but nothing out of the ordinary either. Doesn't even come close to Kathy Reichs or Patricia Cornwell. No substance."
2,The obvious suspect,"The book started off at a great pace--very tight and intense. However, I thought that many of the characters were cliches. The female detective with something to prove, the beautiful but coldly efficient Dr. Sara Linton, her hunky ex-husband the chief of police (who only cheated on her because she was coldly efficient and he needed attention from her). However, the biggest disappointment was that I figured out the killer early on. He was a cliche too."
5,This band is amazingly chilled....,"The lightning seeds are a great band. Their songs can best be described as airy and light, makes you feel all fluffy, soft and warm inside. I love this band. When I have a hard time choosing something to listen to I just pop in the lightning seeds and it makes my day. I absolutely adore the lead singer's voice as well. They're simple and kind of popish, but they're a joy to listen to. Highly recommended."
5,Fun book to read to the kids!!!,"Continuing and seconding ""A Customer""'s review. ""Whatever a kid could do, he did, except, perhaps behave.""I loved reading this book to my kids as much as they loved hearing it. I read it to them so much, that I used to have the whole thing memorized. This was one of the most fun books to read and the kids would laugh at all of Dan's ""adventures."""
3,Not impressed for the price....,"For the price, I certainly expected more when it arrived. There was no ""WOW"" factor when I opened it up. They will be okay for everyday wear but they do not meet my expectations for the amount of money I spent. Had I seen them in the store, they would have stayed in the store. The grey is almost completely clear and the black is not that dark either so it is if you have a slightly charcoal grey with clear beads. Not sure what pair they took the picture of but they are not what arrived at my house."
5,Simply Lovely,Lovely earrings that look much more expensive than the price would indicate. Just the right length and sparkle. Definitely would purchase here again.
5,Great Table!!!,"We got this as a Christmas present for our 20 month old son. Right now we just have Little People on it, but plan to get a train for his bday down the road. It is very, very sturdy. I like that it has a plain green top instead of something pre-printed. He can open and close the drawers by himself already, even though they are very solid. I don't know why the price just tripled, but I also got the free shipping and it ended up being shipped to my door in 3 days. Hold out for this one if you can- its a great table!"
4,spiritual journey in a gangster novel,"I think Michael Ventura had to use the context of a crime novel to get his story published. However, this novel is really a journey of his own self-discovery. He reminds me of Herman Hesse in the way he constantly enters and exits different doors in his own psyche -- almost at random. The central character, Mike Rose, has a mentally ill older brother. So does Ventura. Avid readers of Ventura's essays know this, and it is very easy for said readers to imagine that Mike Rose is Ventura. If you just want a murder mystery, this won't work for you unless you are particularly daring -- and patient. But, if you like to see someone get to the heart of himself, take a chance. You might be blown away by Ventura's prose. Light reading, this is not, but it is very interesting."
2,Mediocre and drawn out,Not one of my favorites. The first half was OK but the second half was disappointing. Disconjointed. Abrupt ending with no feeling.
5,Kentucky Rich,"I am so involved with all of Fern Michaels writings. As soon as I finish one saga, I'm into another. She miraculously intermingles this saga with the Texas Rich saga."
1,"Written for teenagers, not adults","Despite enjoying some of Michaels' other books, I found this to be very disappointing. The entire plot is just too goody-goody and predictable. The caliber of writing is at about the 8th grade level, and the overall quality of this book in terms of plot, depth, and style is best for teenage readers."
4,Kentucky Rich by Fern michaels,"This is a long awaited book for Fern's fans ....it is the beginning of 3 books that will combine & conclude the Vagas & Texas Series books she has written ,,,,,This book was great & picks up the story of the characters in the other books ...as always , when I finished it , I could hardly wait for the next book ....Fern has a special way of making the characters come to life & I always actually feel that I know them ....Maybe we see a little of ourselves in these characters ..!! As always this book will hold your attention & you will fall in love with the animals in it ...I loved it , as always !!"
4,good,"is all right, I like it I don't think is my skin type, very dry , I need something more moisturizerthank you. fast delivery"
3,Has Some Moments... But Was The Beginning of the End,"I have had this recording since its release. It sounds like old school Metallica but just doesn't have the impact of their first three albums. The songwriting is more complex but I also think that makes it sound more contrived. When I listen to ""Ride the Lightening"" I feel like the band's attitude was 'let's kick some rear but do it with a relatively high degree of sophistication where possible'. What I get from ""...And Justice for All"" is 'let's come up with a ton of polished riffs, arrange them like a guitar teacher at the local community college would, and add just a touch of political pretension to our lyrics.' The result is an album with moments of impressive musicianship but one that lacks the heart of earlier efforts. Of course, we who were there in the beginning now know the disaster that awaited with subsequent releases. Compared to post-Black Album Metallica, this is pure genius."
3,Slightly overrated,A very good offering from a maturing bandbuts its true to say that the album has weak points that when compared against tracks like one sound quite poormake no mistake its pretty damn goodbut metallicas best release is lightning in my viewan honest review.
5,This Cd kicks major A** and I Really like ONE!,"This Cd. is the best Cd I have ever owned. And for all the people out there reading this, If you want to get into Metallica, I recommend this Cd, the first one to buy."
3,Not bad but could have been better.,This is not a bad release by Metallica but its no Master of Puppets. I think that some of the songs were hastly put together and production on the album is average at best. Harvester of Sorrow and Blackened are the best on the album.
3,The 3rd best Metallica CD Ever,"Its best songs are Blakenend, And Justice For all, Eye of The Beholder, (and my second favorite song ever) One. All around its a pretty good CD."
2,Great Album....Awful Production,"This is a great CD. Not Metallica's best, but definately up there. The problem I have is the lack of Jason's bass. Why didn't they mix this CD better? I would rather wait for the REMASTERED edition which will hopefully come out soon."
2,THE FLAT ALBUM,"As 1991's METALLICA was dubbed the BLACK ALBUM, 1988's AND JUSTICE FOR ALL should be called THE FLAT ALBUM: ""flat"" being for its flat sound, uninspired production, horrible drums sound, total lack of bass.IN this album, Metallica had great ideas, but Ulrich and Hetfield began to show the world who rules Metallica with an iron hand, by giving new bass player Jason Newsted a ""hot"" reception, by simply practically erasing the bass parts from the final mix!!! It's awesome: a metal album where you can hardly listen to the bass guitar!!That put aside, Jason himself says this album is terribly bad and that he would prefer to record Elvis songs than something like this. Ok, it's full of time changes or whatever, but they hardly work in benefit of the songs.Best tracks are Blackened, One and TO live Is To Die."
4,Good album...,"After Master Of Puppets, Metallica had nowhere to go but down. And Justice For All is still a great album though. This was their first with new bassist Jason Newstead (not counting an EP of covers). The songs are (for the most part) well written, complex musically and well played. The only real problem with this album is the production. ""One"" became their first MTV video (after they said they'd never make one) and the beginning of the end for all the old fans. Their next album would break them into the mainstream and they'd never sound this good again. I'd recommend picking up Master Of Puppets and Ride The Lightning first, but this is definately worth getting."
3,The downfall of a legend,"Well, this is the end.This album isn't too bad; it still has some of Metallica's old sound, but Jason's influence is noticeable, and so begins the death of Metallica (which may have been inevitable following the death of Cliff).The music is well written, and the lyrics have a message (something that Metallica eventually abandons), but it doesn't quite have the feel that it used to. When I hear something from this album (probably One) on the radio, instead of turning it up (as I would anything from a previous album), I instead leave it low and reflect on what Metallica could have been, if they chose to stay true to their original cause.The metal machine is dying and giving way to the money machine."
1,Not a Masterpiece,"Some songs have a good into, but that is where the ""good"" ends. Track 4 is good for the first few minutes then it goes down hill from there. Most of the solos are to long, some of the solos are WAY to long.Most of all, the recording quality is HORRIBLE. Put this cd into a high quality stereo system - an amp/preamp combo w/ high end speakers and cd player - and you will know what I mean! Few albums released in the eighties were recorded this poorly."
2,Not so hot.,"A great deal of Metallica fans consider this to be their last great work. I disagree. This has to be one of the flatest sounding albums I've ever heard. Most of the album sounds uninspired. The drums have absolutely no punch at all, the riffs are flat, the solos sound miniscule, and as pointed out by many other reviewers, Jason's bass is completely inaudible. He should have stayed with Flotsam and Jetsam. The only songs that I like are ""To live is to die"" and ""Dyer's eve"". Those two songs and the lyrics are, in my opinion, the only good aspects about this album. Well, at least it's light years ahead of ""St. Anger""."
1,just noise,"This band, as well as its members (Hammett and Hetfield) are as overrated as I've ever seen. All the reviewers citing this album as great rock music need to go back a couple of decades to the true masters - Led Zepplin. In comparison, Metallica pales. Period, no discussion."
1,Metallica a great band? thats a laugh!,"Metallica has no class. If you call Metallica legends then please Metallica, Get a good song and then i will not be writing bad about you when you get a song worth listening to. But, Metallica's lead singer still has a good...3-4 years left before he tottaly go's down the shoot. Metallica is a laugh and Metallica will always be a laugh in my mind and anybody with comman sence and an I.Q. over 70."
4,"Good tunes, poor production = average listening enjoyment!","This cd can be expressed in two words really. The good two words!! Great songs, good ideas, powerful delivery. The bad two words!! Hollow sounding, poor production, cardboady sounding.I like cd's to have a wide dynamic sound to them. Highs, mids, lows etc. This has only mids and that is my biggest grip with this cd. The songs are great, but production is crap!!Overall it's a keeper but it needs to be remastered of something to fix that dull sound."
5,Best Metallica CD in the collection,"Metallica's fourth album rocked. All members played very well. Each song has rough sounds, cool lyrics, and pissed off guitars. This album also debuted the replacement for former bassist, Cliff Burton, that being Jason Newsted. It seems after this album, Metallica lightened up just a bit. If you want good Metallica, check out this CD."
5,I WISH THERE WERE 6 STARS,"Seriously,Metallica can never be better than this!Awesome thrash album to reaffirm that Metallica can't be beat.I mean,which other band can produce classics like Blackened,Harvester Of Sorrow and Dyers'Eve and mix them up with emotional classics like One and the best instrumental ever'To Live Is To Die'.Kirk Hammett's solos are mind blowing and Lars' drumming is really ambitious as a result of which it doesn't sound so great live in these songs now that he is in forties.James growls and sets his fretboard alight to perfection and Jason can't be heard, a sad tribute to the late Cliff Burton.This ranks as possibly the best album by any band in any genre of music ever!Get it now!"
3,got it too late,"This book is a good book. However, my daughter is 3 and was bored with it. She loves the Hungry Caterpillar and it is much too similar. So I would recommend one or the other but not owning both."
5,"Uplifting, heart-wrenching, humerous, entertaining and.....enlightening.","Cheryl captivates the reader by allowing us a peak into her wonderful realationship with Johnny. There are many among us who will never love or be loved as Cheryl and her brother love each other. Twin souls, on a continuing journey through past, present and future lives. I could not help but feel lightend in spirit as I finished the last page of her book. Thank you Cheryl, for that. Some books you just feel good reading! This is one of them. I've been fortunate enough to have a reading with Cheryl and it was one of the best things I have ever done for myself. Do yourself a favor and read this book and then get in touch with her and learn about yourself by booking her for a reading. Thank you again Cheryl, this one goes in the ""I'll read it again"" stack!"
2,Shell out a little more for a lot more quality,"i'm very sorry i bought this book. It may be concise, and it may be cheaper, but one shouldn't sacrifice spelling for saving a few dollars! The concise edition drops the dots off many of the letters, thus either misspelling the word or creating letters that don't exist. i borrowed the full-sized edition and found it to be fine. Don't waste your money and your sanity on this version!"
1,Do Not Buy This Dictionary,"This is a terrible dictionary. Many of the words are spelled incorrectly and many of the definitions, while technically correct, are absolutely nonsensical."
3,Nice book if you don't have google,It repeated itself a Lot! It was pretty good but i found almost every detail later on the internet and through others experiences and links. I felt that the book would have more specifics per-vegetable cares and so on. Not as in depth as i was hoping for. I honestly think there was a much older addition -at the public library that was as effective and i had gathered better specifics/and data from than this one. Sometimes you cannot improve on something or need not. To each His Own! Still a great concept -and YES it does WORK ...Square Foot Gardening
4,ironic,"I'm not a gardener so my comments are not about the technical merits of the book. I am an engineer and I like Mel's concepts for design and efficiency. That is why I find it a bit ironic that there is so much wasted space in the book. He really goes on about useless info before getting to the meat of the book. It will serve as a handy reference though, and I am encouraging my young children to read the book. This should help make the family garden a fun and fruitful hobby."
5,Just terrific!!!!,I think that this book is absolutely wonderful. We have friends who followed the book's instructions and they have the BESTraised beds I have ever seen with beautiful vegetables. This is on our agenda for next year~I looked for the book afterborrowing theirs....simply had to have our own book~
5,LOVE THIS BOOK!,"What a brilliant way to garden -- so logical and so easy. We now have three 4x4 raised beds -- an herb garden, a salad garden, and a veggie garden. I recommend this to anyone who wants to raise a lot of vegetables in a small amount of space. And NO WEEDS!!"
4,"Great Ideas, Bad Attitude","Mel Bartholomew believes that anyone or anything associated with traditional row-type gardening is the spawn of Satan, and he makes sure to remind us of that on just about every page. If you can get past his savior mentality and self-congratulatory tone, you will find a wealth of practical, encouraging information in these pages. This is one case where thinking ""inside the box"" is rewarding! I can't wait to start my garden; I just think Bartholomew needs to cook up a nice humble-rhubarb pie!"
1,Square Foot Gardening,"This has been hands down the worst gardening year I have ever experienced. Why? Because I bought into Mel Bartholomew's method using his growing medium of 1/3rd compost, 1/3rd peat moss, and 1/3rd vermiculite. What a mistake! I had the spindliest looking tomato plants EVER. During 80 degree days, I had to water every day or plants would start to shrivel up and die. Lesson learned: Soil is the only medium plants thrive in. I spent a lot of money on the ""ideal"" plant mix that proved to be disastrous for my vegetable garden. Learn from my mistake."
5,gardening made easy.,I grew up on a farm and hated it. This book as so must in it that makes gardening so much fun now you got to get it and try it. Think of all the flowers yu can grow or food. where was this book 30 years ago?
5,WOW!!!! NEVER GARDEN WITHOUT THIS BOOK,"This will revolutionize your gardening experience. If you don't have the ability to think outside the box though, you will waste your money. I was not much of a gardener before this book because it was a lot of work and it just wasn't all that fun. This book brings gardening alive and makes it a blast. It also makes it sooooooo easy. All tha work goes away and the fun comes out. I would give it 10 stars if there was that option. You must have this book if you want great organic veggies the easy way for years and years to come!!!"
4,Lots of info!,Very easy to follow. So much info on vegetable gardening although not real pertinent to living in the Southwest Desert. I refer back to it quite often
2,Grating Style,"The information in the book might be reasonable, but the author is grating. He comes across as very proud of himself, I found it difficult to read just for the style."
5,"So simple, by but brilliant",Lots of great ideas - can't wait to get started! I think we're going to have a better garden than ever this year.
1,not impressed,"I have gardened for years and decided to try this. I already had 8 raised beds so I added a 9th using this method. Everything I planted in it did terrible. The other 8 beds in regular compost and topsoil thrived. In the square foot bed, the transplants never grew any larger than when I planted them and the seeds, very few came up. I ended up ripping everything out after 2 months of hoping it would improve and added regular soil to the mix and replanted new seeds. I spent too much money on this one bed, what a waste. I do like the charts in the back of the book but I won't use this method again."
1,So disappointed,"I followed the Mel's Mix recipe to the letter, and couldn't be more disappointed. Everything we planted is yellow and spindly, if it is growing at all. I wish I would have paid more attention to the negative reviews on here. I was looking forward to seeing if Mel's easy and inexpensive trellis was really going to be able to hold up my pumpkins and watermelons, but sadly I don't think the plants are going to make it. All that driving to get ingredients and all that work... what a disappointment."
4,Fast track to simple home gardening,Mel's methods work well and you can be growing fruits and vegetables and flowers quickly. He relies exclusively on compost for fertilizer and I found that I needed to add some plant fertilizer to get better yields. I'm in my first season and things look good so far!
5,Quick and Easy,This a great system to involve the family especially young children in the gardening experience. They will learn about Nature's gifts and the needs of plants. It will bring them closer to nature. As they become adults and garden on their own they will experience the joys of gardening including of watering which can even be Zen-like. WHAT A WONDER.
5,Easily grow your own produce-save lots of $$$,"This is the best method that I have seen for growing fruits and vegetables easily, with great results. It takes a little bit of money to develop your Mel's Mix (garden soil) the first time, but once you start composting, its virtually free.With industrialized agricultural companies spraying who-knows-what on our produce, and organic food being more expensive, this puts your own organic food within reach- and the cost is only a little bit of time.Eat better and live better- use the Square Foot Gardening method."
5,Good for beginner gardeners.,Great book! New edition has wonderful color photographs. Have fun with your garden and produce great produce! Can't go wrong with this book.
4,Gardening for kids,"Seems like a good book so far. We don't have anything growing yet, but our 2, 4 & 6 year olds liked building the garden, mixing the soil and planting the seeds. We had a hard time finding one of the soil ingredients (vermiculite)at a resonable price, but since we have a small 2'x4' garden, we were able to buy a number of small bags from our local home center and get by with that."
4,Build Me a Nation,The premise is strong and the story is well-told. I enjoyed speculating if thigs might have turned out this way in the same situation. I'm inclined to disagree with one or two things as they're presented in this book -- I think the British would have been more punitive toward the rebellious colonists -- but maybe I should just write my own book. All that's needed is a good knowledge of the facts and a bit of informed speculation -- both of which are actually hard to come by. Maybe I'll stick with reading what other people write.
3,only the jacques lu cont mixes.........,"a pain that i am used to was the song from Angel screaming for a single, the single is not really good however. the only remix which sounds correct is the Jacques lu Cont mix, his dub is beyond my understanding, it's like almost the same, it also uses all the vocal elements, so why dub? goldfrapp fails to repeat her magical re-production on Halo 2004, this remix is boring, so are the other mixes. what a pity."
3,Not what they advertize but its ok,The box was smashed when I got it. The gold rim around the plastic top was off.... this is not a bronze lamp it is BLACK. For 7.00 dollars its ok
4,Floor lamps are so expensive,"I never really bought a new floor lamp I guess. Finally started looking when I moved (and gave away my good lamps) and realized they are very pricey, even for a basic lamp. Walmart was typically my go-to option for cheap items to just ""get the job done"". Even there they were expensive. Ended up trying this lamp out and am very pleased. Yes, it is a bit cheap and up close it is somewhat obvious, but for $20, it is probably the cheapest floor lamp that will get the job done. It looks nice in the room and I am not willing to pay a large amount of money for a lamp as a renter who will most likely move every year or two."
3,You get what you pay for,"This floor lamp is a little awkward. It is wobbly and the shade is made of a flimsy plastic. On the other hand, it serves its purpose. The vendor was thorough and fast. Delivery of the lamp was quick. I would recommend this model for a dorm room or family room. The price is consistent with product designs and features."
1,"Cheap, ugly lamps.",I ordered 2 of these lamps because there were 3 reviews that were all very positive. No one who has seen this lamp could honetly say that it doesn't look cheap. It's very short for a floor lamp. I can see down into the lamp when I stand up. They looked so bad that I threw them out.
4,It's a lamp,"I read quite a few of the reviews before making this purchase and I must say that if you are going to be overly critical, don't buy this... But if what you want is an affordable light source, this is your lamp.. Easy and quick to assemble, plug it in and you're done... Yes, the bowl/shade is made of plastic and the trim doesn't fully encircle the lip. (there is a few millimeters where it gaps) But for the price, it can't be beat..."
4,"good, a little deceiving...","I enjoyed the soundtrack because of the music. I expected, however, for some of the other music that was a part of the movie to be in the ""soundtrack"" I.E. I Need Ya by Zahid Tarag. All instrumental with the unique sounds that only Hans Zimmer can bring to the table."
5,It's Mr Crabs!!!,"Awesome high TY quality and solid construction that allows all the details to shine through, I just wish it had a string that you pulled to make Crabs say: Money! :P"
4,Decent horror flick,"After a long pause between good horror movies, I actually enjoyed Dead Silence. Its far from great but it is better than you might think. If you liked Darkness Falls you will probably like this."
2,"""puppet master"" meets ""the ring""","boring and predicatable. actors were bad. rip off of both puppet master and the ring.id give it 1 star, but puppets always get me."
2,Disappointing,"I really do worry about the future of horror films. I grow more disappointed with every new one I rent out and Dead Silence is the same.Although this looks like a chilling movie it falls flat in its delivery nonetheless. It does have its creepy moments, but nothing that will have you on the edge of your seat. Matter of fact this movie really did not hold my interest for long. It was a lazy and overall very safe horror film. 13 years olds will love it- but us older horror fans will find this yet another story that sounds promising yet in the end feel once again that we have wasted both our time and money. I do not recommend it.2/5"
1,Stupid movie !,"Boring, bad acting, not scary at all and stupid scenario.Don't even rent it, save your time and money."
3,Busman's Holiday,"This short book is a neat introduction to the world of 1940's jazz and Billie Holiday. It is brief enough so that you could probably finish it on the way to work. Billie Holiday has not yet been captured effectively in a full length biography, but this book is a step in the right direction. Margolick does not try to delve very deeply into Billie Holiday's artistry or her difficulties as a black woman trying to make it in a white-dominated world, but he hits some interesting highlights. If you like this, your next stop might be Angela Davis' Blues Legacies."
5,classic album of Morocco's number one group,"This album was recorded a few months after the death of founder-member Boudjmaa in 1975 and contains the group in full-force. Actually, the versions are more solid and go to a kinda hardrock Moroccan style. What Full House is for Fairport Convention is this album for Nass el Ghiwane"
3,Only for the ABSOLUTE beginner,"I had been surfing for about six or eight months regularly before I bought this book. Thus, there was almost nothing that helpful in here for me; I already knew how to paddle out, pop up, what kind of conditions to look for and which to avoid, I'd already boughten an appropriate board. Nothing in the book mentions more advanced/intermediate tips I was looking for like how to turn/carve, or technical aspects on differences between boards.That said, this book would be good fot total beginners who have not tried surfing yet and just want to be sure of the facts and basics. Many of these things you will pick up intuitively, but some of it will not automatically come naturally, thus the book is good to prevent/check bad habits, create good ones-- i.e. don't look down when you ride a wave, arch your back when you pop up, etc."
1,"Horrible Unit, Poor Quality","I own two of these units, I use one for my home PC to mix outputs to my speakers and two different sets of headphones (one is a headset), and the other for my audio studio. Both units have serious problems with hum and crackle. They are very poor amplifiers distorting the output in a way that makes listening to music quite unpleasant at times."
4,Extremely Good,"""Rewind"" was a terrific story but even for a fiction book it is still suposed to be realistic aside from the fact that he is getting a second chance to live. One flaw was how fast the media would back off of everybody. The second that Kurt told the media he was just covering for a friend they backed off. So did the crazies and as desperate as they wouild be I dont think that they would do that. I also thought that some characters were just a little to gullible- that might not be the best word to describe it. Either way their are some things that left me skeptical but it is a fiction and a good one at that. You will find it hard to put down, I read it within a couple of hours and enjoyed it."
4,Rewind to live,"Rewind is an awesome book to read. It's about a boy who gets hit by a car and dies. Then he is given 3 chances to go back in time with his memory of what happened to change the outcome. He can't just stop himself form running into the car, he has to go back farther and figure out how to make things right. Along the book he has to deal with things like, finding out he's adopted, his mother is about to have a baby and when he does a project in art, his parents think it's a waste of his time. It maybe be kind of short but worth reading. Enjoy!"
2,Dissapointment,"Not what I hoped for. I already have built in wireless and I was using this as a connector for a canteena. When I made an atempt to use the adapter without the canteena it gave very poor performance.If you have wireless and want to make it stronger, this is not the product for you. If you need this for use with another wireless booster. I would go for it but only after you check out other deals. I don't think the canteena websites recomend this product for it's performance."
1,Great themes but I am not rich,Very seldom one can find a good music with good soundtracks at the same time. film producer don't care that much about the music of the films. Consider Lord of the Rings. The film is awesome but hte music is very simplistic. The music of Conan the Destroyers is awesome but Hell!!!! Look at the price!!! Beethoven CD's are around 10 bucks. This is definitely not over 100. I would love to buy it... If I could...
2,"Educational, but dragging","An adult might like it, but you can get the same info reading online articles about emigrees and Ellis Island.It jumps around from person to person, and shows the Ellis Island building about 100 times.It is not entertaining for middle school or high school students at all. It has a lulling to sleep quality.It repeats info too much, and is too slow in moving forward."
5,"Oh, SAY can YOU see.........?","What's not to like about this flag? I LOVE it! It's well made, with sturdy copper grommets, and it should last for many, many years. SALUTE!!!"
4,Good Experience So Far,We had no problems in the ordering or shipping of this flag. We have been using it a month now and it is in as good a shape as when we received it.
5,Proud of the U.S. flag,"If you are looking for a sturdy, beautiful flag, this is it. I am glad that I chose this flag from US Flagking. I am very proud to be displaying this flag in my yard."
3,Made in the USA,"The flag I received is polyester and made in the USA. The stars are stitched and it seems pretty well made. Time and high winds will tell how well. Overall, this is a nice looking flag and for the price I feel its worth it.August 2010 UPDATE: 4 months later and this flag is very faded. Still in one piece but not even close to the original color."
5,WELL MADE IN THE U.S.A.,"This flag is exactly as described. Despite what one of the other reviews said it is 100% polyester, not nylon! I just wanted to say that it seems very well made and it is made in the U.S.A. That's something that is important to me but I didn't see it in the description. I just went ahead and took a chance and ordered it. I'll be flying it 24/7 in very windy conditions so I'll let you know how it holds up. The flag it's replacing only lasted about 3 months. I expect this one will last longer from the looks of it!"
2,A survey of first encounters,"The book gives an overview of a selection of first meetings between Europeans and other cultures. It has several thorough chapters on (e.g.) the Aztecs, the Tahitians and the Japanese, and more episodic chapters on many more. Several chapters on native Americans may have special interest to North American readers. While containing many fascinating tales, it does not, however, reveal any systematic approach. It is also rather superficial and disappointingly ethnocentric in tone in many places. The potential of drawing on the many 'case studies' in the book to extract some broader insight is not utilized. Hence, its analytical aspects are weak, to the point of being non-existent, and its usefulness for graduate students and researchers accordingly rather limited."
3,dvd,"the movie factoids just names the cast and crew,and a short bio and filmography of richard grieco. the making of is 4 min 51 sec long and contains clips from the howard stern show and entertainment tonight. unless you really love this movie i would suggest the vhs over the dvd."
2,Rhymes with,"The author's name rhymes with ...?? Enough said; good book to see liberal thought process if you don't mistakenly try to follow him logically all the way through. Accept him for what he is and the 'progressive' philosphy for what it is; a feel good worldview that is accepted and defended with religous zeal. Useful NOT in understanding logic of modern Liberalism, but helpful in understanding Bush derangement syndrome, their fear and loathing of truly religous people, and even those who love and respect the Founding Fathers and the truly unique and incredible system of self-governance they created. Not an honest or comprehensive comparison of the two schools of thought, nor the history of how Liberalism of this kind has always failed and worsened the lives of those they espouse to care about, as contrasted to how American Conservatism has worked every time it's been attempted WITHOUT too much (see Bush 1 and 2) watering down."
4,Stepping into someone else's shoes,"Lakoff's Moral Politics is one of the most enlightening reads I've encountered this year. When I bought this book I was hoping to learn how to see the world the way Conservatives see it. Now half way through the book, I now realise that the political spectrum as laypeople see it contains many, many shades of gray. For those who think of themselves as liberals somewhere on the left of the political spectrum, Lakoff's work will help you understand why liberals and conservatives believe in the things they do. His argument comes down to differences in parental styles. This book is an important contribution towards understanding the political economy in the West."
3,works for side but nor for back,"The firms sides of the pillow are good for side sleepers - most side sleepers sleep on pillows that are too low and dont provide enough support, but I don't see why there has to be anything sticking into your neck when you sleep on your back. Seems to me the proper position for that is NO pillow. Cut out the wedge n the middle and it might be 5 star"
4,Reduces neck pain,"This pillow may take a night or two to get used to sleeping on, but is saving me money in chiropractor bills for sure. I love it and take it everywhere I travel now. My neck no longer hurts in the monrning. I also have reduced shoulder pain from side sleeping since it helps take the pressure of your shoulders."
2,Too firm then breaks down too much,This pillow was extremely uncomfortable because it was too firm and actually caused my neck to hurt worse. After a few weeks or month the foam broke down too much and doesn't give enough support now. I am very disappointed in this pillow and would be buying a different pillow if they didn't cost so much.
4,Good for Cervical neck patients,"Pillow helps keep neck in a position that will not leave me waking up with neck pain. I have two fused discs which have resulted in severre muscle spasm instances. Pillow won't resolve the issue, but certainly helps."
2,for a biginer it gives a note,I read this book in a library and want to have one for me in my collection.will it be possible for you to send me a copy of this book as a complementry copy at free of cost.My AddressR.RAMA CHANDRAN121/1 SECOND MAIN ROADSOUTH JAGANATHA NAGARVILLIVAKKAM - CHENNAI- 600 049SOUTH INDIAThanks and regardsR.Rama Chandran
4,Two Winners Doesn't Make a Grand Slam,"PARADISE LOST units J.A. Jance's J.P. Beaumount and Joanna Brady under one cover, which may or may not work depending your involvement with either characters.An artist is hanging her works for her first ever one-woman showing when she is brutally murdered. The classic theme of nothing is ever what it is on the surface reveals the victim was in the witness protection program that didn't work. Sheriff Brady has her staff deep in the investigation and as added support the Washington state's attorney general sends a special investigator, J.P. Beaumount. The sparks fly with expected results.J.A. Jance manages to deliver some clever character development through the eyes of a second character with the departure to a two-person point of view. A good read that is both mystery and thriller.Writing as a Small BusinessSins of the Fathers: A Brewster County NovelGuns Across the Rio: A Texas Ranger in Old Mexico"
5,Her Best Ever!,I've read all of J.A. Jance's books and think this is her best yet. Putting both J.P. Beaumont and Sheriff Joanna Brady together was brilliant. I couldn't put the book down. I would love to see her bring them back together again.
3,Not what I was looking for,20 or so years ago I got a single engine Cessna book. It had one page for each year and mpdel and gave a very detailed description of each change each year. It got borrowed a lot and one time did not return and I forgot who had it last. I was trying to replace it but have been unable. The last 2 books I have ordered have some of the information but not all.
1,Buyer Beware,"I bought this about two months ago. After one week the image became distorted, and it would only play in black and white. I called customer service, but I could not get in touch with anyone live. I also sent them three e-mails, but they never responded. I returned it to Amazon, and they sent me a replacement about a month later. Amazon initially said that they would replace it in a few days. If they told me up front that it would take a month, then I would have asked for a refund. I have had the replacement for about a week, and it is still working. I'll update this review if I run into more problems.Overall, I don't recommend this unit. It just isn't worth the risk, and the customer service is awful. If you do buy it, then please save all of the packaging and don't hesitate to send it back for a refund if you encounter any issues."
2,Piece of junk!,I too loved this unit when I first purchased it but mine too failed after about 10 uses!!! Do not buy this PDVD player if you're in it for the long haul. I recently purchased a different brand. Hopefully that one will last longer.
2,"Nice Picture, Sound & Battery Life. Bad Mechanics","This player has a metal case with a nice picture, good sound and about 3+-hour battery life. Sold for $149 at Costco in a package deal with case & 2 Headphones. Went threw 2 different players which showed the same problems it would freeze after awhile and you could hear the motor grinding. I thumbed it with my finger then it would skip a track them play for awhile and freeze again but more often. Gave the first one 4 days then the second 3 weeks to work the kinks out but no good so returned it. Not a Dependable Player and gave up on it and Mintek."
1,Misleading Advertising,"I'd like to give the product a rating but I can't. I ordered the 7"" player 5 weeks ago and have yet to receive it. Today, I received my second delayed shipment notice and Amazon's best guess (if it arrives when they say it will) would be 10 weeks from when I ordered it originally."
1,No Picture After a Few Uses,The dvd player was used less than 10 times then it stopped showing picture while the sound is still good. I'll just have to get another DVD of different brand. This one obviously does not last. Will avoid buying Mintek again in the future.
4,Mintek portable DVD player,"This DVD player is workaholic.The resone I gave it 4 stars, because after long use the hing for the screen brook off."
1,LCD weak - screen went black,"I was very excited when I purchased this item. What a great deal - it comes with all the accessories so no need to search and destroy for additional gadgets. The battery has a decent life and if it dies, there is a car adaptor to pick up the slack. Only thing is, it stopped working out of nowhere. I had it on for my daughter in the car - all was well. We went shopping and when we came back to the car and turned it on,the screen was black. You could hear the movie but couldn't see anything. Tried the monitor adjustment but it didn't do anything. Having read another similar review from someone, beware of this weakness. I returned it and now am in the market once again for a good portable."
1,Poor quality dvd player,Sent this back the first day picture skips and could not get battery to connect securly. Headphones and bag are cheap don't waste your time or money on this one pay a little more and get a better player.
2,Hit of Miss,"I originally bought this DVD player because I believe that Mintek has one of the best looking TFT LCD displays on the market (although, it does look a little too dark with certain movies). I was also glad to see that you could set the audio equalization to different setings. What you get for the money is really impressive. Now, for the bad news. I have had this DVD player for almost a year now and suddenly it won't read any discs, it just spins a little and then says ""No Disc"". Never mind cleaning the lens, or your discs, it won't solve the problem. Luckily, I purchased an extended warranty with mine (I don't trust delicate equipment like this to hold up for very long). Judging from all of the reviews I've read on this website, I would say that you are lucky if you get one that doesn't break down after a few months of use. The question is, do you want to gamble with your money, or not. Its up to you."
1,Absolute Crap,This unit stopped working after about 5 hours of use. It was never dropped or abused. Do not buy this unit!
4,great dvd player for the money,"My teenage boys have been using this for over a year and a half and there have been no problems. They've used it at home, in the car, taken it on trips, and to friends houses and it is still going strong."
1,A Problematic Brand... save your money and pass on Mintek,"I have had the misfortune of owning two of these DVD players -- both had problems.The first one became defective after using it for about 45 days. The disk cover would pop open during play, which, of course stopped the DVD and caused you to have to restart. The latch was defective and the sound quality was poor ... I had the Mintek replaced under warranty only to have the second DVD player go out on me after 30 days of use. The screen would glow then go dark, darker, darkest until you could see nada.Do yourself a favor and avoid this shoddy manufacturer. Spend a few more dollars and get a proven name."
2,I sent it back,"My needs were simple. I wanted a portable DVD for cross country airplane flights. This did not fit the bill. It had some nice features but the battery charger never worked.Pros:InexpensiveThe kit contained everything including dual headphonesThe picture image was good.The carrying case was really spacious and of good quality.Cons:The user manual was incomprehensible.(I dubbed the Loser Manual)The sound was mediocre.The latches were ""iffy"".I couldn't get the battery charger in the unit to work. Light went on for about 3 minutes, flickered and went out.I saw other poor ratings for this product so I sent it back. I will buy a more expensive player in the near future."
1,Never buy Mintek product again!,"I bought MDP-1770KIT for an upcoming trip in April. It appeared to be a great product during the trip. But now when I try to use is again after 6 month, the player doesn't play as it should be. It always stops at certain place after it loads the DVD (sometime it does not even load). We changed many DVDs, but still the same. It's definitely not the CD problem. The player stops at different place every time after I cycle the power. So we called customer service, but an agent with sleepy voice told me that it's covered under one year parts warranty :-) but I need to pay $90 labor since it passed 90 days :-(( Besides, I stil need to pay shipping to mail the defected player to Mintek!!! it's more than half of the price of the player!!! I will never buy such poor product which only last for a couple of months."
5,BLESSING,WE PURCHASED TWO OF THE PORTABLE TV'S FOR OUR CHILDRENS BIRTHDAY. BEST MONEY EVER SPENT. THEY GET AN AWSOME PICTURE AND EVERYTHING YOU NEED COMES WITH THE UNIT.
2,It was broken when it arrived,"Ordered this kit for my son's birthday. It took several weeks to arrive (not a problem, since this was stated). The kit is a good deal, but the on/off switch was broken when we went to use the player. Looks like a good product, but we were disappointed."
1,Don't Purchase,"I flipped through the book and saw some nice imagry and thought it might have some good tutorials on the CD-ROM. Was I wrong, this book teaches nothing...it informs the reader of how cool it is to combine Photoshop and Maya and stops right there. I don't know how this book was published with maya on the title."
5,Good music,The Cd has great songs from the movie. The music is for people who enjoy nice and calm sounds.It is very relaxing.
3,Not Sleator's best.,"I have read a number of Sleator's books and have enjoyed most of them. This one seemed to hang on a flimsier thread than most. Apparently he took an incident from his own life (a ride in a Thai wagon) and some material he had read concerning black holes, and from those unrelated elements tried to build an interesting story. The payoff was just never there as far as I'm concerned."
3,The book was good for a real quick review.,I found that the book was a little to basic for the depth of the topic. The topics that the book focused on were the most important topics but they lacked any detail. This book was good for a person just becoming introduced to the subject
5,underrated cd. very good band,this band has great vocals. guitar riffs sound amazingif you're a musician or just a simple fan you will notice this bands greatness
5,Superb,"I bought the Cd as soon as it was out, and it was not a disappointment. Similar to the last however its even better, if you aren't a Calling fan yet, you will be after listening to it. Definetly have a listen, its a must do thing"
3,a little repetitive,"Given the CD does have some good songs the songs seem overall quite repetitive. Its like i could fast forward to almost any spot on the CD and have no idea what song it was. I do really like ""things will go my way"" because it is easy to relate too. Some of the lyrics on other songs seemed too predictable. I like the sound of the CD i just wish they would have thrown in some variaty."
4,Two is a must have...,I have been a fan of The Calling since Camino Palmero came out and since then I had been waiting for their second album eargerly (but not patiently). So here we have Two. And it does not disappoint...The songs are a bit less sad and angry and stuff.Alex and Aaron are trying to focus on the positive things this time around. They all are really good songs with lyrics you feel as if have either been writen just for you or by you yourself. That's how much you can relate to this album.
3,A few really good songs stand out,"I bought this album hoping for another ""Wherever You Will Go"", and was disappointed at first. On a quick listen, the songs sound mostly the same: pleasant, but no deeper than that. But as I listened more, determined that I had to have missed SOMETHING, I actually found some of it better then I remembered. And I was more suprised when I really heard the lyrics, they were much, much deeper than I had first thought. But I didn't find that with every song...I only really fell in love with 3 or 4 songs. I highly recommend sampling this at a CD store or something before you buy it to see if you like it, but hey, that's actually good advice for any CD!"
1,NOT FITZGERALD,"Recorded Books,LLC used Fitzgerald's translation for the Iliad and they said so on the back but they don't say who translated the Oddessy at all which implies Fitzgerald. I like to read and listen at the same time and that is impossible to do with different translations, the frustrating part is I don't know the translation they used, but even if I did just from the few minutes I heard I wouldn't want to know anyway."
4,stop nonchalantly giving 5 star reveiws,"Orb fans take a serious note to this cd. There is no possible way to be disappointed if you like the Orb. A couple of the software products Gabor Csupo uses is Cubase and Pro Tools, software we all can use to make inventive and innovative music. Four stars because five stars is carelessly considered with music that probably doesnt even deserve two stars. And thanks to the people who give false reviews of music they obviously have no clue about. Stop to listen and hear."
2,Not up to standards?,"When comparing this with ""Invasive_Plants. Weeds of the Global Garden"" it would seem logical that at more than three times the price this book would offer considerably more. It does offer more text, and color pictures that are a little bigger. In addition there are small maps of California, showing distribution and small line drawings. This book would gain in accessibility if each new species started on a new page, if the line drawings were of a size and quality more aimed to facilitate recognising the species and if a more consistent format of color picture had been used, preferably showing some characteristic details.By the way I do worry about the way both books recommend the use of herbicides like glyphosates (roundup and the like): it sounds as if the cure may be worse than the plague."
5,WOW!!!!!!!!,This was a very very good book. You really should read it if you are as horse crazy as I am.
2,No African-Americans?,"Although most reviewers found this movie to be very accurate, I find one glaring error.... NO Americans of African decent. THE FACTS: George Washington himself requested two black oarsmen to accompany him on his boat. The biographer of ""The Crossing"" made sure he included the action between Henry Knox and General Washington in reference to swamping the boat, but again, no blacks. Please understand, I was excited to finally see a positive portrayal of my heritage displayed on the small screen. Can you imagine my sadness when seeing we were purposely left out? (Every other aspect of the film was painstakingly accurate.) I am keeping this short, check the facts and remember we were there!"
3,"5 star entertainment, 2 star history","I think this film is great for its entertainment value. Jeff Daniels puts forth an excellent performance as General Washington, and the direction and editing do an excellent job of building suspense during the crossing of the Delaware River. Even though I knew the outcome, I found myself concerned about the ultimate success of the mission. That being said, the portrayal of Henry Knox does a diservice to the father of American artillery. While John Glover and his men did yeomens'work during the crossing, Knox commanded the operation. It was through his efforts as a leader, working in concert with Glover, that the Americans succeeded in their task. The movie disparages his achievement for comedic effect. Overall, I recommend this film, but watch it after reading David Hackett Fischer's ""Washington's Crossing"" or David McCullough's ""1776""."
4,Surprizingly Good,"I think Jeff Danials did a surprizingly good job of portraying the hard-to-cast Washington. I wish I had seen more of Glover's boat work getting the canon and horses across, but all in all, it had a good feel about it."
3,Come On,"This CD has some decent songs, but it doesn't deserve the 5 stars the other reviewers gave it. It's definitely not as good as Nazz' first album. (Todd didn't think so either.)"
4,"It's English-Hebrew, not Hebrew-English","My husband needed Hebrew-English not English-Hebrew. Obviously it says that on the cover but it was a hasty purchase and we did not realize that it wasn't a two-way dictionary. It is good though, but be clear that there is nothing here to build a better English vocabulary for native Israelis. I kept it for myself since I am a native English-speaker and want to perfect MY Hebrew so he will stop joking on me (lol). It would be better if it had transliterations; I know people frown on that, but everyone learns differently."
1,This book sucks unless you're a senior portrait professional,"This book sucks unless your a professional senior portrait photographer that likes cheesy barnyard senior portraits. I'm not kidding! If you're a serious amateur and want to learn the techniques of natural light portraiture follow the recommendations of others and buy ""Professional Secrets of Natural Light Portrait Photography"" by Douglas Allen Box like I did. You won't regret it."
1,With an album like this can you really blame music pirates?,"Who are the theifs now? Making anyone pay money for this noise pollution is a crime. Seriously, I suggest downloading this album if you want to hear it, but even at that, it's still not even worth the effort. The production was poor, the musical composition was pathetic, and you could feel yourself getting dumber just for having listened to the lyrics. You'll be better off in life having never heard this album."
3,It's ok....,"When I first bought St.Anger I was very dissapointed. I thought everything was terrible. In reaction I gave it to my friend. When hearing the song ""St.Anger"" on MTV, I started to appreciate it more. I asked my friend if I could make a copy of St.Anger. I made a copy and I,ve listened to it on and off. It's ok but it's not their best or their worst(but it comes close to it). I just needed to give it some time. So, St.Anger is ok."
1,"Boy, this one really sucks.........",I would give this negative stars if I could. I heard this one at one of those listening kiosks in a music store and it was just so painful to listen to. Near the end of one of the songs it sounds as if Hetfield's having his nuts pulled off or something but we all know that those were long gone since the court case against Napster. It just sounds like a bunch of drunk guys beating on garbage cans. I never thought I'd hate an album more than one made by Madonna but here it is. Save your money.........
1,SELLOUT,"I am listening to this cd right and if i didn't have the ocver i would ahve nevfer known it was metallica really really sad. It seemed like it was just pulled together out of a trash can. Like Frantic was a peice of crap. St. Anger was a dissappointment and a sad one at that. And where was the loud pur emusical guitar intros and bridges. I was so dissappointed ""No metallica no"" such sadness bitter feelings towards the bamd. If Cliff was looking aat them now hed be shaking in his grave."
1,You have been warned!,"THIS IS NOT Metallica. This is NU-Metallica! Everyone says they ""evolved"". Why? Why change....Ozzy never has. AC/DC never has. The drums are absolutely PATHETIC, the singing stinks, everything about this evolved garbage [is bad]!Metallica USED to be a HEAVY METAL band...not any more. Thats ok. I bought their lousy cd yesterday, SOLD it today on the web! Got back all my money, and learned a lesson too. Metallica and me are thru! If they keep producing cheap-produced-evolved-GARBAGE like this, they will lose a lot of fans.NO! Just because it says ""Metallica"" doesn't mean (anymore) that it is. The drums sound like a garbage can lid! This stuff sounds like their in a garage...and they probably spent $500 to produce this hyped up junk. (its true that they sound better on the dvd, but THATS not what I put in my car! Besides, even the junk on the dvd,....isn't much better) TRUE METALLICA FANS HATE THIS..."
1,We waited for THIS???,"This has to be the most over-hyped piece of trash I can remember from a band that USED to release quality material. What did Lars use for drums on this recording some old snare drums from a high school band?The songs are horrible, the recording is horrible. Is Kirk Hammett still in the band? Where are the guitars?This band has sued everyone in the last six years and lost focus on how and why they are where they are, us, the fans. Well the fans need to speak loudly and clearly, dont waste your money on this [stuff].Now its clear why Jason Newsted left this band. He wanted to be in a band that made music and was focused on the music. Not a band that produces this garbage and worries more about who's downloading MP3 versions of their albums.Hope you enjoyed life on the top boys, cuz your headed for the [bargain bins]"
1,St. SUX!!,"I cannot believe that I waited 5 years for this tripe. I have been a rabid 'Talica fan for 17 years, I never would have believed they would stamp their logo on this piece of crap. The sound is AWFUL, the lyrics are juvenile, and the tempo sounds like Lar's had a siezure!! Gone is the musical and lyrical genious of Metallica's past...the heavy rolling thunder that I know to be Metallica has been replaced by the worst sounding garage clanking I have ever heard. Sitting through this album was physically painful! If the 'Talica boys want to experiment with some ridiculous cathartic attempt at death metal, they should keep the tapes to themselves and use them for therapy. But the paying customers, the loyal fanbase that catapulted metallica from sleeping on U-Haul pads to mansions deserves far better than this. This CD will sit in my collection and collect dust....if I could get a refund I would!!"
1,Ping - pang,"Because of the awful drum sound I can hardly force myself to listen to every song in it's entirety. It's like when your out to eat or at a movie and there's a baby in the distance crying and screaming. You try to ignore it but it slowly eats at your ears and into your brain until you want to scream and run away.However, the drum sound may be better than the lyrics and volcals. Enough said."
1,St. Anger 'Round my neck... Metallica gets no respect,"If you're not into Nu-Metal (uN-Metal) don't waste your money... even if you think you're getting a good deal because of a discount. I was broken-hearted to see that my former-#1 band released this steaming pile of dogsh*t. I like Metallica's old stuff the most... it kicks major @ss all the way up to ""...Justice..."". Hell, I even like Load, Reload, & S&M, but this is simply intolerable. The guitars are tuned down extremely low (w/drop tuning) and the drums are annoying. James Hetfield sounds out-of-key half the time. There ARE some parts of songs with great potential but overall, I'd say that Bob Rock & Lars Ulrich have butchered this band... Oh, & this album (if you want to call it that) also lacks the guitar solos that Metallica has been praised for on previous records... Kirk looks so bored in the DVD-Rehearsal session."
1,WHAT THE F.....?????,James Hetfield once said that Metallica could crap on a record and everybody would buy it. Guess what? You did and nobody did. Unlistenable garbage. The worst thing to come out since Nirvana.
1,"""False Anger"" would be a better name!","This is the most terrible thing I`ve ever heard in my life! Is it really Metallica? Jesus, it seems like a bunch of kids with a lot of hormones but without any knoledge of music. This is pure garbage, avoid it at any cost!"
2,What a waste of talent!!!,"I remember the first time I heard about St.Anger. I was thinking it was going to be their heaviest release to date, man was I wrong. With all the hype it had, it let so many metal freaks, who were expecting some old school metallica down. This cd is acutally worse than Load and Reload put together. St.Anger has nothing to offer to the hardcore metal head. The singing is pure bull$hit and doesn't sound anythhing like James Hetfield. It actually sounds as if they recorded the singing from James shower. The drumming is one of the biggest letdowns. Lars please stick to the sound that made you famous in the first place. The bassist is a monkey who cares more about dancing on stage than acutally playing. And where are those solos from Kirk Hammet, I mean come on guys what were you thinking. Other than that, I don't recommend this album to anybody except for those nu metal punks who think St.Anger is the greastest thing metallica put out."
1,Ummmm....yea.......ok,"I picked up this album because a friend told me to. I had always kinda liked Metalica but never been a huge fan. This record's purpose was to change that. It did just the opposite. It reinforced my opinion on the bands suckiness. What happened to the Ride The Lightning days? They sure the hell ain't here. The only good songs are Frantic and St. Anger, and even so, Frantic's Fran-tick-tick-tick-tock chours gets very annoying real quick. Don't waste your time. Not even worth it."
1,The Death Of Metallica and Hopefully Corporate Metal,"Let St Anger seal the fate of Corporate Metal. After this miserable failure , hopefully all the major labels will be afraid to sign any metal bands and maybe the underground will start producing bands that can write original talented music. Music generes seems to turn stale and sour once the major corporate labels get involved in the scene. Metallica has been long overdo to fall into obscurity, and maybe finally now Metal can start fresh. St Anger might be just what true Metal needed. A end to corporate rock and hopefully the begginng of a new underground."
1,bang and scream,"They have really fallen.....Once a great band that played awesome guitar rifts. Not and single guitar solo on the entire disk! What's up with that?????? The whole album is nothing more than 3 guy's grinding their guitars and one guy smashing his drums. Oh yes, and screaming, not singing, screaming...... I just shook my head in disbelief throughout the entire album. The ONLY reason they got a 1 star rating from me is because you can not give 0 star or negative star ratings.This is a sad performance from what used to be one of my favorite bands."
1,Metallica....WHAT THE HELL!!!!,"What is this garbage you call music, let alone metal???? Seriously, this is pure trash, the only reason for my one star rating, like the other comments before, is because there is no 'zero rating' or I would have put that. This album is a complete and absolute disgrace to metal. This is as bad as playing something from Backstreet Boys or Nsync. Did you honestly think your fans would enjoy this...this...this...I don't even know what to label it, it's that terrible. I very strongly advise anyone and everyone to stay clear of this album, don't even look at it, it will give you nightmares!!! If you have had the extreme and very unfortunate displeasure of having to hear any songs off of this album, you may need some therapy to try to regain some of your sanity back lol!!"
3,80's metallica tries to fit in new metal wave,"The album is very disappointing. A mixture between 80's metal clichés and Limp Bizkit. No guitar solos, poor lyrics, and the sound is not really good. This is not a good surprise."
2,What happened?,"St. Anger is the first original album that Metallica has put out in almost 6 years. They have changed their style over the years going from a hard, solo heavy sound to this ridiculous piece of tripe that resembles the Korn, System of a Down and Deftones [junk] that doesn't have any melody. Kirk is far too good a guitarist to let him not show up and show off after 6 years of silence. All of the songs sound the same and James Hetfield doesn't even yell on key. Back in the old days he did at least that. I have been a Metallica fan for almost 20 years and have been more and more disappointed with the music in the past ten, but this is just garbage. The solos are what made them great, not hard, muddy and toneless (read: repetitive) garbage. Heart breaking."
2,St. Angry Fan,"To be honest, I am SHOCKED with this CD. I have never purchased a Metallica album that I flat-out hated (I have all of them). Some I like more than others, but I find something about each one that I adore.I put this CD in my system to find that song after song was just bad. The lyrics were subpar. The guitar work, while heavy and loud was missing the solos and originality. The production was bad. The songs seem to have little or no groove or feel. Its hard to describe, but not one of these songs ""felt"" right. They all seemed to be chaotic and messy...So far, I have found nothing on this CD that indicates a quality piece of work. IMHO, this CD flat-out blows...HOWEVER, the CD does come with a DVD with the ... songs being recorded live :-) HOORAY!!!The ONLY reason I gave this 2 stars (instead of 1_ was the concert MP3 filesthat I was able to download from their site.Those were pretty cool!"
4,Finally ... It's METALLICA ... not AlterniticA,"I'm shocked and surprised. I came close to not even buying this given how awful their recent work has been. The ""Black album"" their peak? Try Master of Puppets!It's clear they're trying to return to their old style. It makes sense, the long-dead art of the heavy metal sound is starting to come back into the mainstream. I just question whether they're doing it to satisfy the fans or if it's the direction they really want to go in. Hetfield's voice sounds a bit strained. It just doesn't seem as sincere as their old work but there's still some good head banging material here.I give them 4 stars if for no other reason that we finally have another high energy room-thrashing heavy metal album from Metallica and not some sedated watered down version of them."
1,Cliff 'Em All,"Sad to say, but Metallica has been lost for years without the services of Cliff Burton. Look back at Metallica's musical carrer and you will see that what made Metallica constant in the past, and what has been missing for so many years, is Cliff Burton.Cliff had started writing And Justice for All which set the mood of that albumn. After that, Metallica started to depart from what brought them to the dance. Sure, the BLACK album was great, but it started the departure from what Cliff had always focused on, the best metal going.Metallica needs to change their name, just like they have changed their style. Call yourself something else and stop trying to capitalize on what you no longer are. Sad but true, we can do without you!"
4,New stuff by Metallica,"Even though I haven't listened to the entire CD yet, I can tell just from the first few songs and the beginnings of the others that this CD is very different from most of Metallica's stuff, but my personal opinion is that if artists do not change and grow, they will stagnate. Obviously Metallica knows this and has dropped the other shoe in an effort to keep things fresh. I personally love this effort and this CD."
3,Not bad,"the music and lyrics are not bad. I think metallica is missing something in the album. One of the best things i like about metallica in there mature state of music is that they play what they want to play and what they enjoy playing. They were never really afraid to try new things. However this ablum this is for the people who complained about metallica ""gone soft"". Good music is good music, why does it matter how hard and loud you play it.i personally think that metallica is at their best when they try new things. For Example, the ablum S&M;, Mama Said and low mans lyric.My favorite ablum is still the black ablum by metallica"
4,"Not their best, but definantly a classic.","First off, let it be known that St. Anger will follow the title and anger fans who are into the recent entries from Metallica. There are no radio friendly entries on this album. This album recalls the days of ""Master of Puppets"" and ""...And Justice for All."" It's heavy, 8-minute plus songs are exactly what old-school fans will remember. Hard metal riffs, extremely intricate drumming, and lyrics from a recently rehabilitated James Hetfield make this album a must have for any real metal fan. However, for people that still listen to [bad] music (New Found Glory, All-American Rejects, and any band that starts with the word ""The"") will want to avoid this album. This is something you'll want to thrash to, not show mom and dad."
5,Metallica plays what we've been wanting,"Some will say this is not as good as Load/Reload/S&M, but these are the same people who started trying to be metalheads when it was chic to do so. You won't find any whiney Smashing Pumpkin stuff here. Tally has brought back what got them here--fury, speed metal with multiple time changes. Real Tally fans will know from the first 10 seconds that Tally is back doing what made them so popular as an underground metal band in the 80's. And new bassist R Trujillo brings youthfull fire and drive that J Newstead just could'nt live up to. 5 stars from me."
1,Don't believe the hype...and don't waste your money!,"I'll keep this short and sweet...this is the worst album ever put to tape!Bad song writing, bad production, and the WORST drum sound i have EVER heard. This is not a return to metallica being a metal band... The title track is a summary of the entire album, terrible sounding fast drumming with too much double bass, then breaks into clean guitar and a lame attempt at off time drumming, with a transition that doesn't work very well. The vocals are totally weak, and sound like Hetfield can barely keep pace with the speed of the music. Lars' snare drum sounds like he's playing a coffe can and the bass drums sound like ice cream pails...and his playing isn't even worth mentioning! ..."
4,"Not bad,not great","As soon as I heard St.Anger was out I rushed to buy it.Exciting was the fact a DVD was included in the package.This CD is loud,bone crunching and raw and thats not bad.Lars sounds better than ever abd the guitar sound is quite heavy.However I miss Kirk's guitar solo's.That would have given this CD a sure 5 stars.The bass playing by producer Rob Rock(not Robt.Trujillo,read the credits folks)is pretty darn good.This is a worthwhile CD to own.While far from their best still a good CD."
3,"""New"" Type of Metallica","Everybody has been complaining about the St.Anger CD, but if you remember when Garage Days came out with Jason it was a different sound. Then Justice came out and that was different from Puppets. Oh no! The Black album had songs under 5 minutes. Load/Reload is totally different too! Well that is what they did here. It is different AGAIN. Is it their best, well that is to be argued, I do not think so. There are some good tracks, there are some bad tracks. I give them credit for ""again"" trying something different. The good: Lars druming, James intense vocals. The bad: Lars drumming, James intense vocals. Lars must of got a new drumset that sounds like a cowbell, after a while it gets annoying. James is [mad] and sounds it, but with all of his yelling there is no Kirk with his solo's...what happened there? It is a defintely buy and keep in the CD changer but not one of the all time greats."
1,An exspensive coaster.,"If I was James Hatfield I'd be angry too. Metallica hasn't recorded a good album in over a decade. No exception here, only I'm not surprised or upset, just assured. As for their summer tour, I doubt tickets would even sale if it wasn't for the other bands. Maybe this will be their last. I won this album when I called a radio station to request a song by the band ""Mud Vayne"". I was the 9th caller by mistake. I atleast didn't have to lay any money down for this JUNK! You shouldn't either."
1,STILL DOWNHILL,"I haven't listened to this CD, but I did hear St. Anger on MTV and on the radio. With that said and reading all the reviews, plus the ego-trip with downloading their music/Napster issue, I am officially done with listening to Metallica. All they care about is money, not music. Proof they are about money - the Napster issue; proof they're not about music - after the black album. They are going nowhere, they might as well...QUIT...not retire. Retiring is for after a successful career. QUIT fits them more. They aren't even talented musicians anymore. You want to hear some talented musicians?? Listen to Dream Theater. I am usually pretty good about sticking with listening to a band through thick and thin, but not Metallica. The vibe just isn't there anymore, heck Jason Newsted even quit the band after all these years! Metallica, quit wasting your time, energy and money on new music! Either quit while you're ahead or write something that IS pre-black album era!"
2,Uggh,"I bought this cd in the hopes that Metallica would follow up their claims that they were Quote, ""Returning to their Roots"".They liedThey detuned their guitars and thew away all their musicianship.This is Nu-metal crap. PeriodThey have been going downhill since load.i bet on their next album James will rap or something like that.i can't wait for the new Ozzy album with Jason."
1,Horrible and Disgusting St...,FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DONT BUY THIS ALBUM IT STINKS BEYOND BELIEF NO SOLOS... REUSED NU METAL RIFFS INTIONALLY HORRIBLE PRODUCTION. STAY AWAY I WISH I DID!BUY THERE Pre 1991 ALbums! STAY AWAY FROM THIS...
1,-10 star,"here's the worst metal album of all timewht you hear on the cd is CLANG CLANG CLANG CLENK, invisible kid CLANK CLANKthat's it crap vocal crap riff, repeative lyrics, no solos no nothing. not worth buyingthey put on the dvd bonus so they can sell better. you can see how metallica are falling. this album selling well cause its metallica, but even it;s metallica the album didnt sold that much for metallica standardtheir black album sold 14 m ,load 4 m, reload 3 m,garbage inc 2.5m (riaa count it 5 m because its double cd) and this album less then 2 mi've trade this cd with 5 bootleg cd from various metal band cause it's better then having this album at my house"
1,What happened?!,"What is going on with Metallica? I'd give it negative stars if I could. This CD is straight garbage, I borrowed it from a friend and knew from the moment I heard the first lame ass songs on this CD that I wasn't going to buy it. I'm a fan of Metallica too, but they changed too much and for the worst. Like one of the other reveiwers said buy ""and Justice"" instead if you don't have it already. The guitars aren't cool the drums are boring same crap over and over again. The lyrics are dumb and lame. What Metallica needs to do is go back to their orginal sound like from ""ride the lightning"" up to ""and Justice"" becuase this new stuff just isn't cool. I'm very dissapointed in Metallica's new ""crap"" save your money and buy something else like Avenged Sevenfold, Motograter, Chimara! This is a DO NOT BUY!"
1,Terrible.,"Wow...I really cant even describe how bloody awful this is. Not only is this by far the worst Metallica album. Its quite frankly the worst album ive ever heard. Not even Shakespeare could write a more tragic story than that of Metallica's. James got one thing right in st. anger. He screams ""you flush it out"" over and over again. Listen to his advice, and flush this one down the crapper."
1,i got ripped off again by McTallica,"this album has no licks. its my own fault for listening to the critics. Wesley Willis is way better and has recorded songs far superior to these guy or Phillip Glass combined.I read an article in Adbusters that Lars Ulrich changed his real last name and it used to be Yoghourt. I hope robert trujillo will help them write better songs in the future.This album should have been called ""Tin Can Revisited""."
1,Pass on this one,"Hetfield's lyrics have reached a new low. Buy this album and you will hear lyrical gems like ""tick tock tick tock tick tock"" and ""It's my world, and you can't have it....sucker!"". Then there's the song ""Invisible Kid"", an angry song about someone who doesn't fit in...The songs are long and directionless, the lyrics are boyish, and the recording sound is novice. If this was a product by a new band, no one would give it the time of day."
1,St. Crap,"After being a dedicated Metallica fan for many years I am finally done with Metallica. Load and Reload were disappointing but not bad CD's. Metallica with St. Anger has decided to record their incoherent jam sessions and put them on a CD. No more solos by Kirk, no more depth and perfection, the days of Master of Puppets are over. We are left with a washed up band who left a legacy in music. Now they should cut their loses and retire and at least spare us the pain of another St. Anger. Dream Theater now sounds more like metallica with Train of Thought than metallica does. Good bye Metallica."
2,St. Snareless,No Hammett solos....No snare drum....No feeling. I feel like this was a big joke played on the true fans. I wonder if they will actually play the songs with guitar solos and real snare sound in concert. I hope so. This stripped down Metallica sucks.
2,Worse than a Metallica Cover Band,This is the worst Metallica album ever! It sounds to me like a bad cover band. The single release of the title track and Sweet Amber are probably the only songs that remotely sound like what I expected when I bought this. Save your money...this is a real disappointment.
2,Sound is awful,"This is the worst sounding CD I have ever heard. I simply can't listen to it. I was so pumped about this cd that I went to the record store at midnight the night it came out to get it. I stuck it in the car cd player and I noticed it sounded funny. I tried to adjust the treble because the symbols sounded funny, and I never could get it to sound right. I wasn't my speakers. The music on this disk is probably a B-, but the sound makes it a D-. I think the title track is the best song they have written since Bob Rock came on the scene, I can only hope that we will see some of this material remixed and rereleased."
4,Taken aback,"I've listened to this album several times over and over again now, and I can say, that Metallica took me by surprise this time AGAIN!I remember the time when the Black Album was released - hardcore metal fans couldn't accept it, because it was too weak for them. Now reading the reviews around mine here I can see that the other side of Metallica fans doesn't accept St.Anger - it is too strong or Angry for them.Metallica survived the fan shift in 1991, it will survive now - it just shakes the UNTRUE fans off.Before listening to this album you gotta be prepared to bashing and banging your head, just like 18 years ago."
1,the worst album in the history of heavy metal,"simply the wosrt (production - sound , especially the drums are like tin - the tracks are very big and you must be a really fanatic metallica fun to stand hearing the whole album) I cant believe that this is metallica. Buy it in vinyl so you can serve to your dog food"
2,How the mighty have fallen,"What's to say which has not already been said before? This is a terribly mediocre album. Metallica have been amongst my fav. bands for over fifteen years now, and I am not averse to their lighter moments such as Load and the Black album, but this is just plain ridiculous! Given, it is heavy. And fast. And raw. But where are the insightful lyrics? The soaring melodies? The awesome guitar solos? They are, for the most part, missing.It is over for the Bay area thrashers. It has been a good ride, but all good things must come to an end. Au revoir!"
1,Why?,"How could a once-great band like Metallica put out such a lackluster release? Here is why this is *NOT* worth your money:1. Guitars: As many have noted, there are NO leads or solos on this album. NONE. The riffs are identical to anything you would hear on the radio: downtuned and overly simplistic. This is certainly not the Metallica I know.2. Drums: What is Lars playing, a garbage can? I mean, seriously, these guys are multi-millionaires, can't they afford real drums?3. Production: My band's four track tapes sound better than this. I listen to black metal, and I still find this unbearable! It's not raw or powerful, it sounds like they took an old tape recorder and went to a garage to produce this.4. Lyrics: Why, God, why?5. Vocals: James has lost all aggression in his voice. He is past his prime.I could go on and on, but really, is there any need? PLEASE, there are so many other more worthy cd's you could buy. How about the new Haunted, or perhaps the Devin Townsend Band's latest?"
1,This CD [stinks],"I am a huge metallica fan. I have been buying their albums since ""kill them all"" and this is by far the worst.I agree with all of the negative comments already posted like the drums, James' singing, lack of bass, disjointed, etc. I would add that none of the songs have a ""hook"". Listen to metallica's early stuff like ""Seek and Destroy"" ""creeping death"" ""for whom the bell tolls"" etc. - you can't get these songs out of your head. Even the so-called ""sellout"" songs had a something that made them memorable and enjoyable to listen to. there is NOTHING on the new album with a ""hook"" that makes the songs memorable. I just listened to the album for the 5th time and don't remember a single riff or song as i sit here.James, Lars, Kirk - I expected much better. Maybe its time to call it a career."
1,St. Stupid,"With this Metallica realease we find the band taking a step in a very awkward direction towards what sounds like new metal. Strangely the fast drumming Im used to from Lars is now messy and unrefined, Jaymz voice is dreadful and Kirk's solos are nonexistant. No one wants to hear me complain so I'll sum it up in one analogy. 2003 shows a regression from the 80s band, regardless the band will sell millions of copies. Meanwhile the new Anthrax shows just how great the band has become since the 80s, regardless the band will sell hundreds of copies. Somehow I missed the logic train."
5,A New Beginning,"Metallica is on a road to play music that is awesome and different at the same time..most bands create music using ""like"" tones..Metallica is coming up with new stuff...for this...they should be honored."
5,St. Anger is a great listen for Metallibashers!,"The first song, Frantik, is real good song to thrash to. It starts off with the lines,""If I could have my wasted days back, would I use them to get back on track?"" James is talking about his days in rehab and how the way you live can determine the way you die. The title track, St. Anger, is all about how anger is misinterpreted and not respected. I personally love to thrash and sing along to this song and if you're a hard core metal fan, you'll love it, too. The rest of the songs are great, too.This album reminds me of Kill 'Em All which is also hard core metal. If you like Kill 'Em All, then you'll like St. Anger. The new back up vocals are put in at the right times. Kirk and Rob do a great job with the vocals. This album comes with a complimentary DVD that shows the viewer Metallica's rehersals for the recording of St. Anger. They're original and the band members speak their minds about their screw ups. So buy this album."
4,superb,"Look folks, nothing is ever going to measure up to Master of Puppets. But it's still Metallica, and it's every bit on par with anything else they've done. There are fans of Kill 'Em All back in 1984 who had a fit because the opening 30 seconds of their first LP - Ride the Lightning - had an acoustic guitar (of course, that led into ""Battery"", on of their most fierce songs ever). Load and Re-Load were put down for what that tried to do, and they are great LPs in their own right.St. Anger strikes me as an amalgam of the difference Metallica styles over the years. It's true that Metallica was at its best when they were more ""dynamic"" or had ""solos"" - but judge this for what it is, an in your face great metal album."
1,"Disappointed ... ... No memorable, signature tracks.","My title says it all. C'mon guys, are you pulling our legs ? Are you releasing the REAL album a little later, and these are only the rejected songs ?There are no memorable songs in this album. Like what an earlier reviewer said, it sounds like one looooonnnggg 75-minute track. When watching the DVD, the songs sounded so monotonous that I fell asleep."
1,They should retire already,"As a fan of metallica for over 10 yrs I have to say that this is by far their worst album. They completely changed their sound so that none of the songs sound anything like their old stuff. Their distortion sounds the same as slipknot or korn and the song st.anger sounds like a blatant rip off of linkin park. Gone are the guitar solos, singing and melody. Every song is played entirely by chords with repetitive punk drumming as james hetfield screams cheesy lyrics. Its sad to say, but this album is actually worse then re load(atleast reload had melody and guitar solos).Contray to the hype st anger sounds absolutely nothing like kill em all, its more like nu metal noise that all the high school kids will love. If you like good, creative bands look else where, these guys are finished. But if you love repetive angry noise, by all means pick it up."
3,worthy for the DVD,"Strongly disappointed in the album itself is all I can say. After listening to the first 30 seconds of tracks 1 and 2 I had to change CDs. Not that the music was bad just poorly mixed for the CD. Bob Rock's work was unsatisfactory on St. Anger. I actually sold the CD the same night I bought it. The bonus DVD is actually what you are buying, with live in studio recordings of all tracks the sound is so much better. If you get the chance buy the CD keep the DVD and find some[one] to buy just the CD from you"
1,...what?,"I am not joking, this is easily one of the most pathetic efforts I've seen from anyone or anything in a long time. I don't mind garage band sound quality, but what I do mind are some of the most mind-numbingly over-used metal riffs I've ever heard in a long time. I'm quite happy Jason finally got smart and got out of Metallica after getting abused for 14 years.I usually like to reserve extreme judgement for bands in Metallica's position who go out on a limb to try something different, but unfortunately I could find no redeeming value in this pile of trash whatsoever. There should be a big party where everyone can get together and throw their burning copy of this waste of plastic into the big garbage can that Lars was using for a snare drum on this record."
1,Once upon a time,"Once upon a time there was a band that rocked!! called Metallica. Please, lets get serious, and lets get honest, this album is the worst thing that Metallica has done. Doesn't matter how many times you hear it, music is not about getting used to or just because you hear it so much that you actually start to like it. Music flows through your ears and gets into your soul, but this just go through my body straigth to the toilet. Please if you are a big Metallica fan, don't buy this album, you'll be terribly dissapointed. Better to keep your memories of Black, Justice for all, or Master of Puppets."
2,Recorded in their garage?,"First, I love Metalica. Now that that's out of the way, this cd sounds as if it was recorded in a garage! The vocals sound as if your ear is at the microphone, and the music sounds quiet."
1,St Arse,Terrible. Vocals are the worst Metallica have ever done. There are 2 tracks that are just about passable ('Frantic' and 'Shoot Me Again'). They would have been ok if they'd been the worst songs on the album...but they're the best!!! 'St Anger' is pure crud. Every song starts the same. Some of the riffs are ok but they failed to marry any of the vocals and the guitar riffs. I'm seriously disapointed. Metallica are dead...give up!
3,"Weird at first, but it grows on you",Give this CD a chance; at first listen I was like what the hell is this? But i didn't give up on it and I gave it a chance and in the end I kinda like it.
1,Oh how the mighty have fallen,"First off, I love Metallica. The true Metallica. I have every album on cd (yes, even the post Black album stuff)and have every album up to Justice on record. But this? WTF is this crap? I love metal, and hey, I'll admit it, even some nu-metal. But this? This isn't music. It sounds like a mix between my neighbors garage band (who actually play better) and a inpromptu Stomp session. You know, I started playing the drums after hearing Metallica for the first time. I used to dream of meeting these guys. Now, I can only hang my head and say goodbye. Metallica, the real Metallica, the guys that recorded Kill Em All, Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets, ...And Justice for All, and yes even the Black album, have lost their way and become everything the fought aganst in the hayday of metal. (...) Rest In Peace, fallen heros. And to those of us who still have metal in their veins and solos in their minds, BACK TO THE FRONT!"
1,this album is brilliant!!! not liking this album is a crime,"i lovethis album its great. it makes the old crappy cds look like garbage. i mean comon, the anger the pain the power of this cd is so beautiful. its so heavy and the riffs are awesomei think its the bands best work.trade in their first 5 albums, keep load and reload. and maybe youll get 18 bucks value to buy this one lolthe first 5 albums combined will get you like 2 bucks, so the other 16 find yourself."
4,Pretty good,"I had heard from a lot of people that the album [was bad]. I listened to a couple songs from my friends cd and i thought it was pretty good, so i went and got it. I've listend to the whole thing and i have to say that i like it. It's defenitley not what i expected. There is no solos by kirk, which was suprising.Its a brutal metal album, but a good one that will keep you listening with a 75 min album with songs no shorter then 5 min. I'd say pick it up if you want a good album to listen to."
1,VERY big disappointment,"I have been the BIGGEST Metallica fan for years...and by all means I STILL AM! This album, however, was a HUGE Disappointment. If I didn't know better, I would have assumed it was some mediocre metal band trying to sound LIKE Metallica (Godsmack...cough, cough) There are NO LEADS!? NONE!!! Was Kirk ON the album? Also, the drums...in all seriousness...sound like tin cans. Very POOR production as well. Bob Rock? NO WAY! The music also has NO STRUCTURE...it's really weird. I seriously hope a rebound album is in the works or this truely could be...The END of GREAT era in music history."
1,A note to Dave Mustaine Fan:,"I was reading some of your Metallica reviews and you are an idiot! Not because of how you rate, but because of the fact that you think Kirk Hammet is a bad guitarist. Well, seeing as your name is ""Dave Mustaine Fan"", thats not hard to believe. Kirk Hammet is not a bad guitarist. You stated that you have just started playing yourself so I wouldn't really talk if I were you. He is also better than Dave!OOPS!"
2,Made me cry :'(,"GOOD GOD...what happened???? The only good thing about it is that even though they sound too much like Nu Metal, they're still better than the other Metal Wannabees. The drums are weak and sound like Lars is banging on a garbage can, the guitars sound like you're listining to them through a drain pipe, and James sounds like he stubbed his toe when he's singing. I think when James was in Re-hab he forgot what Metal is soposed to sound like. I think that Metallica should come out with some sorta CD like a greatest hits one OR SOMETHING to make up for this and oh yea..MAKE IT GOOD! Although if you're still a Metallica fan...go ahead and buy it...it's good to listin to when you're pissed off, somehow the sound is like counting to ten and you're not that pissed anymore."
3,A return to the old Metallica... sort of,"In Metallica's latest album, they attempt to go back to the classic ""in your face"" flare that turned them into Legends. This same flare is something that Metallica fans such as myself believe has been in serious remission since the 1990's. Metallica's latest album ""St. Anger"" tries hard to recover the thrash but overkills it a bit. Catchy songs like the title track ""St. Anger"", ""Invisible Kid"", and ""My World"" all harken us back to Metallica at it's prime while bring in a modern twist. However, many of the other eight songs of the album make me think of that aweful band Godsmack, the other songs are like that really annoying kid who tried to be your buddy in high school - they simply try too hard. Overall, I would recommend this album to those of you Rock fans looking for a healthy alternative to the garbage ""nu-metal"" that is becoming way too popular right now."
1,Awful...Absoloutely awful!!!,"Metallica have really gone down the tube ever since they sold out with the black album. Where are the amazing and deep Hetfield lyrics that brought them so many fans with albums like And Justice for All and Master of Puppets? Hetfield's vocals have gotten worse with every album and they've hit rock bottom with this album. They've really lost the plot and I think they're trying to compete with and sound like other younger metal bands, and to be honest it {is not good}.....Guys you should have retired after the Black album."
1,This is a joke...Right?,"First, I am happy to say that I did NOT pay full price for this disc, even on sale it was too much! Second, someone call Lars and have him check his drum kit, I think someone has replaced his snare with a trash can. As far as the bass goes it is weak, I guess that's what you get when a producer tries to fill in. I am sure Mr. Trujillo will add some bottom end to the songs live. If you must purchase this cd, get it while it's on sale. St. Anger sounds like all of the other generic ""metal"" out there. Now on to the things I like about the disc. The DVD is a nice touch, nice booklet, cool artwork by Pushead. In all, I can only hope this was released as a joke and the real disc will be out soon. I think this disc is way over produced to sound like it was ""under-produced"" and raw."
1,"METALLICA (...),FACE IT !",What a joke the drumkit sounds like trash cans instead drums and the vocals sound like something you would hear in typical NU-metal bands. (...)
1,And they wonder why CD sales are dropping?,"Let's face it kids, they're dead. This is the second worst album. I pleade insanity to the fact that I bought it. Hetfield thinks he can sing when he made his money on the growl.For Hetfield and crew, two seems to be the magic number. There are only two songs that are really worth anything, just like 'Load', 'Re-load' and the loathsome 'S&M;' album.Guys, you got enough money -- take what dignity you can scape together and just retire, like you should have done when you released 'The Black Album'....and you still don't deserve the Grammy. Not for this lump."
4,No happy endings on this dark set,"Good to hear the boys back to bone crunching rock! This is not a glossy, sleek production like the Black Album; it has a true raw sound to it. No clunkers on this set, in which James Hetfield truly exposes his darker side and the demons he has recently battled. Two things that you will notice are that Lars has his snare drum wound tighter than an accountant and that Kirk has no solos. Too early to tell if these are positives or negatives. Need a few more listens. Standout cuts include Frantic, Dirty Window, My World, and All Within My Hands."
1,New and Used from $2.74,"Pretty much sums up the career of these idiots... I hate to say it, but Metallica would still be great they all died in that bus accident in Europe...They've sucked ever since Cliff left..."
