2,NIce while it lasted,"As I have gone back and read more reviews, I realized I should have read more of the negative reviews instead of just one or two from each good and bad, then saw there were more good reviews so decided to give it a shot since the price was right at the time.I bought this pretty much for my husband to take on his Navy Deployments. I am glad we tested it out before he actually had to leave. Like many others our unit lasted barely 6 months. I chucked it up as a loss since hubby got a laptop. But We used in the car a few times to entertain our little one and hooked to the TV. After awhile the screen turned out and the remote quit working. Which was fine at that point I just decided to leave it hooked to my bedroom TV. Well after a little while of that the discs quit spinning at all! No error messages, no picture, no producing sound, the remote and player buttons no longer worked.So I say wait an extra payday or 2 and save the money for a better unit."
2,"Good features, poor reliability","Bought this for my daughter for our 3rd vehicle 5 months ago. After using about a dozen times, it bit the dust. Won't turn on & out of warranty. Wasn't a bad player when in worked, but would liked for it to work a bit longer (we only played 3 different DVDs on it since new). Also, the sleave it comes with to attach to the car's headrest is poorly designed. It covers the power switch and the connection clasps are directly behind the drivers head (& uncomfortable). Even though it has strong features (nice headphones & remote), we'll be replacing with a different make."
1,Not good,Great product design but worked only once... not reliable and I can not play any dvd videos. Headed for the scrap heap!!!!
1,Only lasted 30 days -- Coby wants more money to repair it,I bought this for a Christmas gift. Lasted 30 days. I bought the service contract -- but that doesn't take effect until 90 days. Coby wants me to ship it back at my expense AND send a money order for $18.00 for them to ship it back after it's been repaired (they wouldn't say how long that would take).This is product support and customer service??DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK!
1,Coby is very bad quality,I own it only half year and play about 20 times. then it's totally not working. LCD is white screen and all the button is not working when you turn on it. but the warrant is only 90 days. don't order Coby stuff.
1,"After 5 months I purchased, it is dead.","I bought this unit in August 2, 2006 and it is dead already (01/05/2007) and could not read any DVDs and CDs. Always showing ""Wrong Disk"" on the screen.The Mfr warranty only covers for 90 days. This unit is very easy to get over heated and dead. Not worth for the money."
4,Why we prever COBY,"The potable Tablet-Style DVD Player is great for car, hotel or even your bathroom when you take a long soothing bath. Only minus is cleaning fingerprints off since the the display is not protected. We still love it."
3,"no av in, battery contacts misaligned, otherwise good","I spent a lot of time trying to research if this model has av input. it does not. My unit came with the battery contacts (the metal pieces inside the unit) misaligned such that i was unable to charge or use the battery. The contacts are far inside the casing, basically inaccessible without disassembly.Otherwise, the picture looks good, the sound was reasonable. It comes with a ton of accessories which someone already detailed. The casing has a rubbery feel around it which makes it seem durable. The screen is nice and glossy.This player is also known as PD-DVD7050 (search google) madeby Ningbo First Digital Technology Co., Ltd."
1,BAD QUALITY,The thing worked for a few times and I left it there for 4 months. Recently I used it once and it broke after that. The LCD lights up but no picture. Speaker is silent. All the botons on the front panel are not functioning.I am able to use the line outs to play the DVD to my TV though.I just found out that the warrenty only covers for 90 days. Too bad. Don;t know if it is worth to send it back for repair.Also I've got two COBY set-top dvd players because they were cheap. Each lasted for a yaer or so.Bad quality:)
2,Good while it works - 90 day warranty !,The player worked fine - until the power connector inside the player became loose 3 weeks after the 90-day warranty expiration.
1,don't do it,"A fine Christmas present for an excited 3yr old turned to tears by the end of March. Every store bought cd and DVD now produces the same ""invalid disc"" error message and will not play. Don't be fooled by all the added components (remote, headphones, etc.) - none of them are worth anything if the unit doesn't work."
2,Bad performance,"Player stopped working. No display, it says open even after closing. Sent the product to Coby for relacement warranty, very poor customer service."
1,"""Wrong Disk"" error after using it twice","Looks nice, which is why I bought it. After using it for only two, very long car trips with my toddler we started getting the ""wrong disk"" error message - and it's out of warranty because it sat in a drawer for 4 months (unused). We only played 3 or 4 DVDs on it and it was treated very delicately. Other issues: Gets very hot, the power button is covered by the headrest mounting fabric case, and even if under warranty you pay shipping fees for something THEY did wrong. I would NOT recommend this unit to anybody!"
1,bad design,Beware the product warranty only covers 90 DAYS. My one is broken after 5 monthes. Some keys did work first and then LCD could not light up. They set very short warranty in purpose and it is because of bad quality.
3,"Great picture, compact, battery built in","I was very pleased with the screen clarity and size for such a compact player. The battery is impressively part of the machine instead of hanging off the back. The black face adds to the picture's appeal. A substantial list of accessories is included: 2 headphones, a cassette adapter, cigarette light adapter, AC adapter, remote control, AV cables and headrest case. Jody Bissoon"
3,2nd Coby dies,Nice features; will not last. This is our second to die within 1 year. Thankfully bought the NEW replacement policy both times.
2,Stopped working after 4 hours of use,"I bought this to replace the DVD player my kids use in the car. They watched a movie at home and it worked great. We were ALL excited it had two sets of headphones. They used it in the car to watch one movie and it worked fine. Then they went to watch another movie and it stopped playing about 10 minutes into the movie. The screen just froze and nothing would work. We changed DVDs and it gave an error message of ""Wrong disc"". We tried disc after disc and it never worked again. I was going to get the same player again, b/c I really liked it, but upone further reflection, I think I won't buy this one again."
5,Keep the kids entertained...,This Coby is a great/inexpensive option to keep the kids entertained! The quality of the picture is nice & the sound quality is good...for the price this product is wonderful! The accessory kit that comes along with the Coby meets all our needs anywhere that we may be! We are verrrry happy.
4,Hot Dog Roller Reiew,"I really enjoy this product.The only reason I did not give it a 5 star, was due to the rollers are not close together, the gap between them are wider than it appears in the pictures on the web site. Therefore you must buy the larger size hot dogs so that they will turn on the rollers.Other than that the product works great.I have told others about it.So over all I am pleased with it."
3,Not as expected.........,"This hot dog warmer is ok if you only want the dogs warmed. As far as the bun warmer goes..... Use your microwave for better results! It dries the rolls out and it also causes the bread to be hard by the time the dogs are ready....... Make sure you PREHEAT it! Otherwise it could take awhile for the dogs to get done. The taste of the dog is pretty good when it is ready. It also only holds 8 regular size hotdogs. If you prefer the longer hotdogs,expect to cook only one on each set of rollers! That is only 4 hotdogs at a time."
2,Very basic,If you are a pro. This book is very basic. It's generally written for everyday people who need a how-to beauty book.
5,Fine Beauty,"This is a must have for ""ALL"" makeup artists. The photo demonstrations are real specific and the instructions are easy to follow and learn."
3,HELL O Mcfly,"For those who must have this and are willing to cough up $70 to $100 dollers.Please read:I agree with the other reviewers that this is a must for collectors of this era in disco.The orignal cd was put out by RSO or POLYGRAM records I guess in the late 8O's.This 1999 offering by miami label OZ records dropped the ball.Why? the art work is a cheap copy of the orginal,Weren't there any laser copiers in 1999 and glossy paper?Second the most irritating of all,the tracks have a 3 second interval between them this is inconceivable.Why would any one do this?THis was a disco record where the first three songs masterfully flowed into each other as Mr.Mindey so had plan.This adding track breaks totally kills the tension and momentum built into the breaks.Especially when Don't Cry for Me is about to kick in.If you own a copy of the vinyl and have bought other cd versions of disco lp's you might be disapointed I was.Be care full how you spend your money."
3,Australian immigrants,"Australian series about European immigrants living in the military baracks shortly after WWII. They all come from different countries and they all have personal story to tell. First half of the series focuses on telling each character's story, while the last few episodes try to kill them off from the plot.Most amaizing performace is guest appearance by Cate Blanchett, who portrays albino italian immigrant bethroted to the mentally challanged Italian man. Her character is so conflicted and controversial that it is difficult to love her or hate her as a human being - but she is absolutely fantastic in the role that is exploration is deep feelings of loneliness, disappointment, sadness and knowledge that being ""different"" physically or otherwise can easily make an individual the unwilling outcast in any society.These series were made long time ago and in today's portrayals of political correctness they are certainly controversial."
3,Haven&#699;t used it yet.,"I&#699;ll revise this someday after I use it. We don&#699;t have the problem in the winter time that we have in the summer, but neighbors don&#699;t mind the mounds in their yards and lawns so the battle will continue. I will use them soon..."
4,Quick Elimination,"I've used a lot of products to eliminate voles and these seem to work the best. I've tried cheaper ones that did not produce enough gas and the little varmits actually dug them out and flipped them on top of the ground. Talk about a ""Caddy Shack"" experience!! The first time you use them you will be a bit surprised as it is like lighting a giant firecracker but after a few times you become quite proficient at it. I've learned to check for mounds 1st thing in the morning and only put them down new burrows, as the critters move alot and may have blocked that tunnel or moved on. Experience is the key to a good kill."
5,efficient,"We in Florida have been inundated by armadillos. Since they have no natural enemies, we needed something permanent to destroy them. These work very well as long as the hole is active."
1,Alot of smoke and mirrors,"Well, I've gone through the whole box, and no luck in clearing out my pocket gopher problem with the ""Giant Destroyer"". I was as close as it gets to an active burrow, I watched the gopher stick his head out of the hole, and I ran over and dumped the lit destroyer into the hole. I quickly sealed it, and you could hear the device burning underneath the dirt -- and there was no leaking smoke anywhere in the yard. So this is the best case scenario, a entire tunnel filled with smoke, knowing the gopher wasright there. Things were quiet for the day, but sure enough at dusk, another new hole pops up in our yard.So my advice, you can probably skip this step, and move on to the traps, and then poison pellets for the gopher problem."
1,Doesn't work,"Do not buy this product for moles.. It doesn't work. I do not suggest them. Do not waste your money. After trying all the crap at Lowes, and this, the only thing that worked was this [...]"
1,Not an effective product,"I must have bought more than two dozens of the gassers. Initially, I thought they were effective. But the last time I used them, they did not work at all. Even after using two bass bombs in one hole, the rodent was not killed. So I doubt its effectiveness and will not waste my money again. The concept is great, but the product is not poisonous enough to kill gofers."
5,Wonderful and fun to use (for pyrotechnics!),I just used four of them and was amazed at how long they burnned and smoke they generated. These worked great and my chipmunks are history. Used as directed.
1,Please consider your products,I have been used this product for two years and it's worked perfectly. But now this product is no longer work for me. Maybe the company has been changed to new product's method that cause not work at all. Please go back to your old product's method that you have been made before year ago. Thanks
1,not well crafted,I'm a violin teacher and I know that violins this size are not going to produce much tone - but this one is worse than normal. Plus the fittings (like the bridge) are not fitted well or adjusted to the violin. When you play the A string you can't help but hit the E or D string at the same time. Strings are high off the fingerboard so it's hard for little kids to push them down easily and when you put fingers down the bow hits other strings. I know the price is cheap but you get what you pay for.
1,Capra near his worst,"This film marks the beginning of the end for Frank Capra. His creativity appears to have deserted him -- he makes extensive use of footage from his own, far superior Broadway Bill. It is understandable that he would use footage from the earlier film's climactic, thrilling horse race. But he also intercuts entire scenes from the earlier film, then brings back the actors and apparently expects us not to notice that they're 14 years older! The only point of interest is one of the last appearances of Oliver Hardy. Otherwise, you'd be best advised to catch Broadway Bill instead."
2,Just Stupid,"This is the first Johnstone book I have read. It will be the last. This is coming from a conservative. No liberal in the world would act like Andy. Dumb action scenes in which 4 men in their 60's defeat a heavily armed force of 50 brutal criminals. Way too much graphic sex discussion and characters that you would like to see killed, including the heroes. I understand Johnstone is trying to make a point about liberalism, but it's just way off the mark."
2,sort of promising. sort of...,"Well, im not sure i see anything here that resembles Smashing Pumpkins, but Mellowdrone does seem to be working more in the vein of Jeff Buckley or Broken Social Scene (who have just released the album of the year so far in my opinion). Probably with only half the inspirado, though. Based on this ep I'm not going to be rushing out to buy the full length. He reminds me a bit of Pete Yorn, wearin' his influences on his sleeve and all. All in all i'd recommend this to an 18 year old, who has just realized Metallica and rap-rock is just complete hogwash, and wants to get a little artsier in his/her tastes. Only one song really did anything for me. Sort of promising, Sort of. Good emo. Sit emo. Sit.LISTEN TO BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE."
4,Flying Boats & Amphibians,"David Oliver's book is a must-read for all lovers of flying boats and amphibians. He covers several different types, some seldom written about in other books - like the Grumman Albatross and the Short Solent. The author brings many interesting anectodes, as well as houndreds of color and B/w photos. The only minus would be that it's too short. A Volume II would be greatyl apreciated!"
1,Save your money,"This pill box is extremely difficult to open once it's closed. And I am not some arthritic senior citizen, but an active 35 year old with good dexterity.The lid fits too tightly once it's snapped shut, and the lip of the lid is flush with the bottom piece. Very aerodynamic I'm sure, but you'll break all your fingernails trying to pry it open. I have to use a nail file tip to open it again.Also, the craftmanship of the piece is poor in general, especially for an item of this price. The sticker inside says ""Made in Thailand"", and frankly it shows.Save your money and look for something else."
3,Misleading description,"The description says 1200 mg. so when I ordered I thought I was getting 60 capsules @ 1200 mg. That's not the case, each capsule is 600 mg.so you have to take two a day and so the bottle is a 30 day supply. I feel the description is misleading."
4,This book has such a twist that you never see coming!,"When I read the ""twist"" I had to re-read it to make sure of what I read. Took me by surprise, and shifted the whole plot on it's head. A great read!"
1,The wire gauge is misleading.,"I bought 5 spools of Pyramid RSW16100 16 gauge from All Audio Expo Inc.Speaker wire does not at all look like the high quality wires as pictured - they are purple. And these are not 16 gauge as advertised, they're a much cheaper 18 gauge.I also bought 5 spools of Pyramid RSW14100 14 gauge. Same thing... the wires are purple. And RSW14100 is not 14 gauge, but is a thinner 16 gauge.So be careful because Pyramid Power is mislabeling these speaker wires."
3,Redundant repetition,"While I greatly benefited from the writer's own perspective on the use of REBT for many of the situations in which we find ourselves in life, I found that the book would have been just as useful if it were as long. He essentially just kept writing about different clients and how he applied the REBT model to their problems. Aside from all the REBT stuff, I did find a few gems, like the idea of sorting our problems into emotional and practical problems. I just wish the information provided was a bit more concise."
2,Real Buju CD?,"I like a lot of songs on here by Buju, though it is not quite his best. However, the singer on many of the tracks distinctly does not sound like Buju. I am questioning if this is some sort of bootleg."
5,The beginning of a great career,"Buju Banton is the most gripping, inspirational artist in the world today-maybe ever. Everyone in the world should hear his music, it would change their life, it surely has for me. People around here in Virginia only know his music through me, and there isnt anyone who doesn't love it. A great album by the World's Greatest Artist"
5,thank you Rita,"Filled with lush, inspirational writing; weaving a soft, delicate web of words; a fountain of quiet wisdom. This book and its techniques for self-discovery have truly helped me discover who I am. (Gay and Proud!) It has changed my life. Thank you, Rita!!!!"
3,Journal Inspiration,"For anyone who has ever wanted to keep a journal but felt intimidated by the prospect, or for anyone who has started a journal in the past, only to become stalled in the process, ""The Way In"" provides a wealth of inspirational techniques and opens the door to creative self-expression."
5,Wonderfull!,If you have read any of Lurlene Mcdaniel's books before you know how good they are. This one and the follow up to it were my favorite books of hers. The follow up is Angel of Hope. I liked that one better but to understand it more you would have to read Angel of Mercy first. If you have read and enjoyed her other books you will Defintly LOVE these ones! If you havent read her books before I think these ones are a good start!
5,recomended,"oh my gosh,this book wsas awsome!i cried when ian died and when the little baby died.i recommend this book to anyone who believes they can make a difference"
1,THE MOST HORRIBLE CD TO EVER HAVE BEEN MADE,"DONT EVER LET YOURSELF HEAR THIS CD. I washed my hands and face and recited the 23rd Psalm three times after hearing the first track. The ""Family Reunion"" song made me sick--to ever imagine that someone could write a song like that and let children hear it is awful. Teenagers these days are condemning themselves just by buying this CD, and it serves them right if they all don't get to go to heaven. Look what they're bringing this world to.A Christian person would never touch this CD, and I think we should all stand up against the sinners at the record companies who make this nonreligious nonsense. I think everyone who bought this CD should go home and read their Bibles until they feel clean enough to enter a church again and beg for forgiveness. None of this satanic junk should ever be allowed to hit the market, and if it were my choice, not a single teenager who has listened to this CD would go to heaven."
5,BEST OF BLINK-182,This is definately the best blink-182 cd I've ever listened to.The songs are just the best and the jokes are hilarious!Worth every penny!!
2,I love Blink but this CD ...,"I loved Enema of the State and Dude Ranch but this live CD (and Man Overboard which just doesn't do it for me) is not nearly as great. The jokes inbetween the songs (actually part of the tracks) are awful and you cant skip them if you want to hear the songs. I can't wait until their next REAL cd comes out and I hope man overboard is not one of the songs. Btw, i am playing enema of the state as I write this (not return, the good one)."
5,Gnarly CD!!!!,"I love Blink182. This CD rocks!!! I've loved Blink182 since they were know as Blink. I've been too many of their concerts, and this CD is like your there! Even though they have all the radio-crazed songs, its still good. A definite improvement from Enema of the State. With Mark and Tom cracking jokes between every song, and there catchy songs, you'll never be able to stop listening to this CD!!! Cons about this CD is: too many popular songs. I would loved to see more Cheshire Cat songs, and less Enema. And bit too much cussing for people who aren't used to. But otherwise, worth your money!!! I can hardly wait for, ""Take Off Your Pants and Jacket"" and other CDs and cocnerts and live albums to come!! And Blink182 ARE NOT SELLOUTS!!!"
5,Luther has talent & an incredible voice.,The album's singer has an exceptional voice. His blues songs match some of the best big name blues artists I have heard during my life - and I'm 52 years old !!!This guy really needs to be listened to by the public and he also has an exceptional band backing him up.I'm serious people.
3,"Spacious And Big, Know What You're Buying",I use this bag for the gym and it works well for that. It easily holds all my stuff and looks nice. However I've tried to use it on trips but I just couldn't sacrifice the space! Because it's made out of sturdy leather and is roomy it will consume quite a bit of space in a suitcase. I instead went with a small nylon Dopp bag from Target for travel.My only complaint about its functionality is that its internal elastic straps don't hold small bottles very well; they immediately will slip out and clatter around. They would have been better off providing a number of stretchy mesh pockets for small bottles.
3,"""Ma"" is a cheap thrill","Ma Barker's Killer Brood is a treat to watch. Lots of ""shoot-em-up"" and depression era interiors and cars. Far from the truth (as were most biography movies of the day) but the acting is fair (well, actually good for a cheap ganster movie), the story is a good one, and it seemed to actually have a fair-sized budget. I rate the reproduction quality 3 1/2 stars out of 5. The other 2 movies are just cheap, terrible, poor quality reproductions, and I stopped watching each half way through. The low price is worth it just to get the Ma Barker movie (and only because of the Ma Barker movie).The DVD did not freeze or skip."
1,Not as wide as need be,"I ordered these and another pair of Life Strides in a 10W, based on a review by someone saying they were wonderful. If you have a wide foot like mine, they were way to tight for my everyday comfort across my toes."
4,Does the Job,"I bought this product to mount a 19"" Samsung LCD. It came in a neat package and was simple to install. I was disappointed in how the wire management is designed and it is a little ""stiff"" in it's movement.But it served it has served it purpose well."
3,nice unit,works well. It has a good solid feel to it. It holds the angle of the tv very nicely and allows for adjustment to the tension of the angle. Cable management works but it's not a nice as the units that have a hollow core designed to hide the cable completely.
1,Only tilts left to right,"I wanted an arm to mount a third monitor above the two on the desk. I liked the idea of an arm so I can pull it close when I need to see detail. You can imagine my disappointment when the ""easy, one-touch tilt and up to 180 degrees of swivel"" only referred to left-right swivel. It is completely useless for my purpose. I tried installing it sideways, but the monitor is too heavy for the arm to hold up.Additionally, I'm not sure if the fault is my monitor or this device, but my monitor has an indentation in back to fit the mount's metal square. This metal square is a tiny fraction of an inch larger than the indentation, rendering this product double useless, if such a thing is possible.The only good feature is that the cardboard box it came in is nice and sturdy, so it will be great for mailing Christmas presents in 10 months. If I realized I was paying $25 for a cardboard box and some garbage, I would be totally satisfied with my purchase."
5,fine product,This product exceeded my expectations. I was afraid it would be too big for the small TV I wanted to mount but it was not. In fact this mount is quite compact. Very high quality construction and finish. All hardware of fine quality and packaged nicely as well. I bought this to mount a small Panasonic LCD TV on the side of a kitchen cabinet. It was perfect for that. The ONLY issue I had were that the screws to attach the mount to the TV were too long.
5,Great Wall Mount - Easy Installation,"Very solid - well designed. It installed in minutes and was easy to attach to my 20"" LCD/DVD TV."
3,Not bad... but sure could be better.,"First of all, I was quite disappointed when this monitor arrived and I found it was not really a ""flat monitor"". It's screen is as bulbous and curved as any regular monitor I've seen anywhere. I decided to try it. The picture quality was decent once I got it all adjusted - and if you're a gamer you'll do this for every game, too. Whenever my resolution changed, I spent 10-15 minutes trying to ""dial-in"" a good (just comfortable) view. Once done... well, it's a 19 inch monitor. Not a FLAT 19"", but a 19"" none-the-less. Also, the case was bigger than my wife's NEC 19"". I don't know why, but it's huge. I've returned it for an NEC FE950+BLK."
5,great product,I bought this for my 2 yr old son who is crazy over thomas and friends. He just loves this game and never gets enough of it. Has alot of educational learning to it along with great graphics. U wont regret buying this product
3,"Somewhat entertaining, but mostly flat.","I thought Bloodletter was more interesting in the beginning, with the evil villian's planning, but when Bashir and Kira go into space, it just turns into one endless confrontation after another, with fairly boring characterizations."
3,Not Quite There,"The song selections were good. However, what I messed when I looked at the albums was ""Original Artist Re-recording"".Folks my age want to hear what they heard on their radios in the late fifties and early sixties, and on American Bandstand. This wasn't it.Still, I enjoyed the album. I would be great for someone who wasn't familiar with Doo Wop and wanted a feel for the music of that era."
3,1/2,"A Perfect Circle is a band unlike anything I've ever heard before in my life. However it lacks what it is compared to a lot more than it should be. Maynard James Keenan is truely an amazing singer and performer which seems to overshadow the rest of the band because of Tool's popularity. It also doesn't help that the two bands have a lot of simalarities between them. Billy Howerdel has been making this kind of music for sometime with Failure and he gets not even half the credit as Maynard. I think this could have had an effect on the bands songwriting capabilities. The first half of the disc is clearly amazing and original, then turns into some kind of post-alternative sound. If they would have kept consistancy in the feel and sound of their music, then this one could never get old, or overshadowed by bandmates past success with other bands."
3,Not Tool,"If you saw APC live and you really like them, you should really check the album out. Believe it or not, but those tunes actually sound better here. If you heard ""Judith"" on the radio or you Tool and think you'd like Mer de Noms based on that, there's no guarantee. You may love it, but I did not. Everything from the texture to the melody to the words gives this album a really depressed feel that doesn't ring as true as Tool's abandonment. Even the most nihilistic song the album has to offer, radio fave ""Judith,"" sounds more forced than genuine. Explore further if your interest can't be contained, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
2,Diluted For Radio,"If you're smitten with Tool, you'll probably discover Mer de Noms to be a paltry side-project. The popular radio-tease ""Judith"" is perhaps what all Tool followers have grown to know and love from the mouth of Maynard James Keenan, however that is the only tenacious track on the album. If you're looking for a return to the condensed viscosity of Tool, don't look for it in A Perfect Circle. Given those involved with its production, Mer de Noms was recorded, mixed and mastered extremely well, but someone put a muzzle on Mr. Keenan. A Perfect Circle is clearly another band."
2,Good LP,Must say I was a little disapointed after I listened to it. I was expecting an album a little more like Tool. The single greatest track on 'mer de noms' is 'Three libras'.This is still a okay cd but not a must have.
5,Amazing,"I saw A Perfect Circle on 4/29 and the show was absolutly amazing! Mer De Noms does NOT sound just like a Tool album, it is much more melodious. Lyrically it has much to say and is not filled with meaningless banter. I am a huge Tool and Maynard fan and I assure you Mer de Noms is not a disappointment."
5,A Perfect Circle,"A perfect circle is a good CD, buy it, if you are a heavy Tool fan, you may be dissapointed. APC is not a ""heavy metal"" band. It in no way is heavy, it is alternative rock. The only people who will say they are heavy metal are the ones who heard Judith on the radio, and havent heard any other song. I believe this is one of the best debut albums ever, this could possibly be one the best albums ever. Favorite songs are Rose, 3 Libras, Thomas, Orestes, Judith, Hollow. But every song is great with the exception of Over which isnt a real song. DO NOT EXPECT IT TO BE AS HEAVY AS AENIMA!"
3,He can sing!,"This album is decent, with a couple of good pop songs, some good instrumental work, and not too much self-indulgent murk. It doesn't have enough variety to remain exciting for very long, but it isn't long enough to become crushingly dull. The real surprise and revelation is Keenan's performance. As he said in a 2001 Spin interview: ""...I think a lot of Tool fans weren't aware that I could sing.""""Judith"" was simply an excellent song. Possibly the only thing associated with Tool that you can really sing along to."
5,heaviest thing i've ever heard.,"this cd is incredible. from start to finish i wept. never has such a heavy band made such brilliant music. THIS is heavy music. not since tool have i heard anything this powerful. even if you don't like tool you need to buy this album. listen to it start to finish, don't skip tracks. buy two copies and keep one in the plastic."
5,Wow,"Ok, I admit it. I'm not a Tool fan, and I bought this album solely because of 3 Libras, which was getting a lot of airplay at the time. The strings on this one, the lyrics--everything--caught my attention immediately.So I bought and listened, not sure what I had gotten myself into. As each track echoed through my house, I marvelled more and more. Every track on this CD is exceptionally solid in its own right, each one a little different from the previous, almost evolving from each other as the CD plays itself out.I really hope Perfect Circle isn't a 'side project' because this album is about as close to Perfect as a first venture can be. Billy and Maynard hit something very real, an earnestly heartbreaking album that I can't forget."
4,some great stuff here,"I'm hoping that I can get more into many of the songs the more I listen to the CD. Presently, I absolutely love The Hollow and Orestes. These two songs contain absolutely powerful and heartfelt choruses. Especially at the end of Orestes, this is my favorite part of the CD. Don't you guys/girls love that Judith video? Thinking of You is pretty good. I just hope I will start to appreciate more of the songs. I better see the Judith video again soon or else!! Maybe I'll post a later review once I listen to the CD a little more."
5,One of the Best!,"This is the best cd I have heard in a long time! If you like Tool, you'll like this one. Its not as hard as Tool, but that is what makes it special. The songs are beautiful and spiritual. You have to buy this one!"
4,"Sometimes they rock, sometimes they don't","Mer de noms is a good cd. It has some very good tracks which rock like the hollow and judith, but I don't like the soft ones. A Perfect Circle is a good band I guess but they should do more rock."
2,A very disappointing release.,"I don't like Tool but I thought that since ""Judith"" wasn't as hard or aggressive as the songs you would hear on a tool album, I had high hopes for A Perfect Circle, especially since Trent Reznor had invited them to open for NIN on his tour. When I finally bought the album, I was sadly disappointed. With only 2 good songs on this album outside of Judith--those being ""Rose"" and ""3 Libras""--all the rest of the album is rather average and sometimes just outright bad , especially the song ""thinking of you."" While I may not have liked Tool at least I had a measure of respect for them. I have no respect for A Perfect Circle"
5,man you WISH it got better than this,"I got this CD at the beginning of 2001 and it still is constantly played. This is so different than anything you will ever hear. And this time, it ISN'T just Maynard's vocals that makes this a masterpiece. They mix the evil soft side of music with occasional harder rock. Every song perfectly flows into the next. The best songs are ""Orestes"", ""Rose"", ""Thinking Of You"", and ""3 Libras"" but they are all amazing. They are much better than Tool and if one of Maynard's bands stays around for a long long time, I sure hope that it's this one. This is a great album with talent from all areas."
4,A Band To Keep An Eye On,"I bought 'Mer De Noms' knowing very well that it was going to sound a lot different than Tool. I saw them play last week with Nine Inch Nails in Lakeland, FL and I thought that they put on a better show than Trent and co. Anyway, A Perfect Circle is a mellow album, and Keenan's vocals complinent the music just as well as they do on heavier music (Tool). The album is atmospheric, and not simply a 'singles' album like most these days.The album proves that there IS still good music out there, that you can have metal be slow, and melodic, and without having some amateur rapper singing. This is a band to keep your eyes on in the future. If they keep up the good work, there still may be hope for rock music and the imminent end for the annoying rap/metal."
4,"Great, but sometimes unequal","I agree with those who say that A Perfect Circle isn't a side project. The lyrics, the music, Maynard's voice, Paz's beauty... everything's almost perfect. Of course, it's different from Tool, but both of them are great bands anyway. Concerning the songs, I particularly love Judith, Rose, The Hollow and Orestes, maybe because they are the most representative of the atmosphere of the album.Now the bad side: the ""hard"" songs. Why did they made songs such as Sleeping Beauty and Thinking of you? I mean, they could have been good songs, but they just interfere with the rest of the album, disturbing the atmosphere. I just skip these songs when I listen to Mer de Noms.Well, anyway, it's really a great album. I'd give 4.5 stars, but I can't, so just trust me. If you're open to anything new, you won't be disappointed if you buy it."
5,A PERFECT CD,"Quickly, along with the Deftones ""White Pony"", the best of 2000. The more I listen, the more I like."
4,maynard's side show,"this album really shows what maynard is vocally capable of. he actually puts so much emotion into the vocals that you feel his hapiness and feel his pain. dont miss this one, especially if you are a fan of tool and their music. it is dark at times, melodic at times, and overall a great listen. so you have to keep an open mind becuase this is not tool, they seem more bent towards appealing to the mass audience, but it is a worthwhile experience none the less."
3,"OK, but","The guitar riffs are great, the drum tracks are cool and the lyrics are deep, unlike other band's in the genre.The general layed-back feeling I got from the album made me feel that I can still relax while listening to a metal album.However, the album is very repetitve. The absolute majority of the songs are in the ""three-quarter"" scale, which is sounds to me like a gimic and annoys after some time.Bottom line: A cd that is great to be heard every once in a while, when you feel kind of blue... Can't wait for their new album."
5,"I am a retro freak, I love things from the past","What can I say, I love things from the 20s 30s 40s and 50s.These cars are just adorable."
3,"Mix of religion, reality and fantasy for willing foreigners mostly","A story is of teens growing in new Russia freed from Soviet and traditionally-Russian moral as a major character's single mother had left for new beginnings with an American husband, rejecting an unwanted underage 16 y.o. daughter-schoolgirl.Actually, a script is short of both text and legal factotum but rich of extremes while brutality and crime in the post-Gorbachev country disintegrated of the beginning of the 21st century depicted as, one could feel, with very fairy-telling among which easy moving between countries-entering the EU, Sweden, for instance,- even for Russians well-hilled is simply an imaginable possibility even nowadays.Mix of religion, reality and fantasy targets willing foreigners mostly."
4,Too Many Suspects,"A heart attack, murder #1, a suicide, murder #2 - a lot of activity to sustain the action in this ""who done it?"" We do not see much of the personal Morse: a few very short musical excerpts as well as several visits to local pubs. Max suppplies the humor, while Morse and Lewis provide excellent sparring throughout. Add in a couple of vignettes from the tour group's participants as well as a minor mystery surrounding an antique and historic piece of jewelry ""The Wolvercote Tongue"" and we have a very good episode - well worth our time. One wonders how much better it could have been if they had been able to devote more time to Morse's idiosyncrasies."
2,Can He Find Another One? [West side],"The West Side 8:00 version is missing the lyrics portion. That particular version on vinyl was a very good one. I wonder why on this CD, the second track was just all instrumental, no one singing. I haven't received a response from OZ Records Inc., grooveusa@aol.com yet."
2,Didn't work as well as I had hoped..,"After reading some of the reviews, and seeing it at the local Petsmart, I decided to give this a try. It can turn the snow into blue slush, but it wasn't able to melt any ice. Maybe getting close to 0 degrees F is a little too cold for this product to work. It might work in areas where it's only just below freezing."
2,My least favorite book of hers,"There's a reason why Cristabel's other books are priced high and yet this one is plentiful and cheap: it's terrible. I could barely read it, and I'm a fan. The plot and characters are incomprehensible.If you want to try her, don't let this be the book you choose. Check one of her others out from the library."
5,Like these blades,I found these blades to work very well and arrived from the shipper quickly. I would order them again with no problem.
4,Solid 80's R&B,"Im serious, this was a solid album, and his second music album ""So Happy"" was even better with a few powerful ballads (like 'Tonight'...so good). I really would like to find these CDs. I had them on cassette at one point..."
1,Another failed attempt for fame.,I really don't get why anyone likes his music. His Daddy was talented... this guy is not worth the time or your dime. Boring and pretentious attempt to be the real deal.
2,Darren d.,THAT`S HOW THEY DO IT IN DIXIE. IS A OK CD IT GOT HIS OLD SONG`S BUT 3 NEW ONE AND TO ME THY ARE NOT TO GOOD.TO ME HIS OLDER GREATEST HIT`S CD`S ARE THE BEST.I GIVE THIS CD A TWO STAR.HIS 3 NEW SONG`S ON THIS CD JUST DON`T DO IT FOR ME IN DIXIE. THANK YOU
1,thats how they do it in dixie,"i was happy with the album especially the title song as i like country music probably the most this album is one of the better ones i've listened to as i live in australia the only way i can keep up with current american artists is by watching the Country music channel on Foxtel,and i have only recently seen and heard Hank Williams jr on this channel but i am impressed with his music and as i only have two of his albums at the moment i am sure in the future i will purchase more at the moment both albums are good this is the better of the two."
3,Carly being told what to do,"You can fill Carly being told what to do on this CD.Trying to be like everyone else.""My new Boyfriend""sounds great at first,but just doesn't get going.""Tonight and Forever""could have been a great song,with some changes.It's just stuck,and can't move. When I heard Carly was going to do a song called""Tired of being Blonde""I thought,what a great idea.Wrong,the song plays the same cord,over and over again.Carly didn't write this one.But,""Anyone but Me""is fantastic,it should have been released as a single.Also,""Can't give it up""with Luther Vandross singing background Vocals.This song is worth the price of the CD.This Record was Carly's beginning to a great comeback the next year.First,the ""Comming Around"" Platinum Album.Then the Oscar winning ""Let the River Run"" It was finally great being a Carly Simon Fan."
4,The Spoiled Girl...,"In the midst of the 1980s, Carly Simon grabbed ahold of the popular synth dance pop sound of the time, pouring it over her own classic lyrics, creating the less than well recieved, but still wonderful ""Spoiled Girl"" album. With more than a passing Madonna-esque sound, you could have thought this would have made a nice hit for the well established singer-songwriter, but inconsistancy in producers, and some dodgy tunes barred it's success. The best songs, in my own opinion, include the bouncy ""Interview"", and the album opener ""My New Boyfriend"". The true dud of the collection would be the weak effort of ""Tired Of Being Blonde"". A should have been hit, this record is a nice addition to any pop fans collection. Fun Carly stuff."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This CD contains new stereo recording by the original artists, NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!"
2,Worked great until it didn't,"Bought this about 8 months ago. Worked great until today. Suddenly whenever it was plugged into my system, it would constantly cycle between detecting devices over and over, while windows made that special 'usb device connected' sound. So now I'm hunting for a new one. Preferably not Targus."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This should be criminal. ""Original artists""- maybe. Original recordings- definitely not. I kept wondering what was wrong with my ears. Some of these sound pretty close to the originals. Others are just awful. If you remember the originals, you will not want these re-recordings."
1,"skimpy, poor construction...","I was in a hurry when ordering this and didn't check the reviews -- My bad!The wire gauge is NOT 14 -- looks more like 16. If you intend to use connectors designed for 14 gauge wire, they will NOT fit this wire properly. The plastic insulation isn't evenly distributed around the wire core, resulting in multiple thin spots. The vendor's tech support was useless; I'll be returning this to Amazon & buying locally, so I can visually confirm that I'm actually getting what I paid for..."
3,not what expected,searched for OUTDOOR speaker wire and this item came up and when I received it was clearly not outdoor quality speaker wire but regular speaker wire I could buy from any general store. I should have done more research but thought this was a simple purchase and search and wasn't looking for ultra high end merchandise. I will use it and see the results down the road as to how it holds up.
2,Not High Qualify as Stated,this is supposed to 14 gauge I have 16 that is thicker. I should have paid a little more to get better wire.
3,Seashore Murder,"Storytelling at its finest, Nevada Barr's ENDANGERED SPECIES features the little known Cumberland Island off the coast of Georgia, home to the Loggerhead Turtle, which many have fought for to bring back from the edge of extinction. The island is on our must visit list the next time we are on the east coast and I'm sure to read this addition to the Anna Pigeon series for its descriptions of the fauna and wildlife of the island.The story is marred by too many characters, it becomes confusing but Barr's powerful prose keeps your eye glued to the page.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,He or she?,"Without giving anything away, I wonder if other readers of ""Endangered Species"" have noticed the very odd gender change of a major character in the novel (not Anna, of course!) In the hardcover edition available at most public libraries, this character is female. However, in the paperback edition, the same character is suddenly male. I find this completely inexplicable - why the change? Please inform, as I have been curious about this for years."
4,Great reading of a changed story.,I love listening to this book as Cindy Williams has an enjoyable voice and does a good job reading. The story is enjoyable as well but it is so changed from the book at times it bares little resembelence to it. I am not referring to the fact it is abridged and much is left out. I refer to the fact for example that a character that is a man in the book is a WOMAN on the tape. Such changes alter the structure of the story and make it into a DIFFERENT story than the one you expect to hear. If you have not read the book this is a moot point but if you have your in for some surprises.
4,Up to par,As usual Ms. Barr has done it again. this was a good book.It is a little different as Anna is on a island not in the mountains or the desert and there is only one small fire from a plane crash but as usual Anna get's her self in trouble & almost killed again.Story line keeps you guessing. A fun read.
3,Anna an Endangered Species?,"I've read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon series and will likely continue, but Endangered Species was a disappointment. I felt cheated by Barr's out of character plot device regarding 'Fred the Fed' - obviously to rid herself of a character she no longer wanted. I personally felt Anna's developing relationship with Fred was her best chance to escape a neurotic preoccupation with the past and her isolationism. The excitement and environmental detail Barr offers her readers is hard to beat, but some of us like our heroes and heroines to be not quite so emotionally bleak. Bad move, Ms. Barr. Men are NOT the enemy, you know."
2,Not the Book of the Century,"This book was, in our opinion, certainly not the book of the century, but it had a few good points. The story of an older, somewhat moody park ranger that enjoys skinny-dipping off the coast of Georgia isn't exactly the type of thing that normal high-school students would usually indulge in, but the book was interesting mostly because of the plot. It was easy to become enthralled with the mystery happening before Anna Pigeon's (the park ranger) eyes, but the story was frequently interrupted by a completely unrelated topic. One can only be bothered that these ""interruptions"" make the story hard to follow, and even harder to believe. There were so many twists and turns in Endangered Species that it makes it easy to compare this book to a bad, made-for-TV movie on CBS. The story probably relates much more to the older people of the world, so if you aren't in that category, don't waste your time."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE!!! I bought this thinking it would be good but this book is not worth the money. I looks like someone copied and pasted random online lessons and book it all in a book. There are alot of typo and it doesn't teach you very well. Instead I recomment buying Japanese for busy people, A WAAAYYY BETTER BOOK!"
4,a nice present for a loved one,"I bought this as a present for a loved one that went on a working trip. This book is for fun for her ""down time"". She likes the cross reference abilities of the book to help her understand better. What can I say. Some people just are fascinated with different cultures and this cures the immediate obsession without actually having to go to Japan."
4,Excellent Book!,A great source of information for those in or entering the medical profession. Mine gets lots of use.
5,Great Medical Dictionary,This Medical Dictionary was more than I hoped it would be. It is easy to use with the thumb index and pictures. It is a great addition to my medical billing and coding books. This is a must have for anyone going into a medical field of any kind. I looked at several others and I am so glad I purchased this one. It has been a life saver for me with my classes.
5,Taber's Medical Dictionary,Great product for individuals just beginning in the medical profession. Is very thorough and a great resource.
5,Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary,"This book is everything that I needed. Small, lots of information, indexed, and very detailed. It is a wonderful resource for the medical classes that I am taking online. GREAT BOOK...."
2,not thumbed!,"Although the book I received was the correct edition and still in the original packaging, it claimed to be thumbed but definitely was not. I was very disappointed upon opening and discovering this folly."
5,It's never lupus!,"I love this book compared to ""stanton"" at my school. I found that dictionary to be too big and wordy. This book was even approved by my professor, so any med student should seriously consider buying this nice reference book. There isn't much more I can say, enjoy!"
4,Violin,This violin is in great condition but I don't know anything about violins so I can't compare to any others.
1,Not Even Worthy of High School Level Writing!,"I teach creative writing for high school sophomores. I wasted a couple hours of my lie reading through this book. I have to say that it is the single worst piece I think I have ever seen. If one of my students turned this into me, I would have no choice but to give them a failing grade. This book has no plot, no storyline, no climax, no theme, and should never have been published.I am considering buying a couple copies just to show my students that being published does not necessarily mean and author is talented.Clair"
2,Not a Unisex scent,"It was hard for me to understand this scent. It smells like a light spice with a dominating green, herbaceous scent that it obvious. Yes it could be tagged as unique but people around me have mixed feelings about this."
3,boc synth style,"For fans of boc this was a different direction that they disliked often, at the time I didn't like it as much either, in spite of the fm hit single! 'dancin in the ruins"" ,which I loved. Now I can see that it's a great synth rock mixture cd that excels in that arena of music ;However boc fans didn't want this type of music from the band at the time. They should give it another chance because it's a great album in it's own right. still it sold decently but fans were losing patience. we want a harder melodic edge from the boys. In fact the last time I saw these guys was in 'la junta' colorado out in the middle of the plains. the rocked the place but probably aren't to proud to say that they were in the middle of nowhere. ""dacin' wasn't even played. Which is a shame. And if you don't give this disc a second chance you won't see that it's not that bad really even if this was the wrong direction for this band."
2,Not BOC,"I'm a hard core BOC fan, this CD like a few others in the mid/late BOC outings was too studio produced, it could really be a Billy Idol CD or any other number of mindlessly produced albums from the mid/late 80's, especially since they used Tommy Price-Idols drummer, he's too tight, too tick-toc, BOC should flow, without Pearlman&Krugman they falter. Although I like Perfect Water there's a better version on A Long Days Night, but who am I to tell you what you like? Listen to the samples and decide for yourself. Imaginos is a great album, this is not."
3,moderately funny with a few standouts,"When one starts to focus on how gorgeous Maura Tierney is and how brilliant Christopher Walken's acting is, one soon forgets that the filmmaker was really going for black comedy laughs.While amusing at times, I found ""The Last Supper"" much funnier and found myself falling asleep in this one. When someone is killed off in a black comedy, I'd rather not be feeling so bad for them. This victim is so likeable it's more sad than funny when he's offed. Yes, he's annoying but he's also a hardworking restaurateur who spent his life building a business.I'll admit, the way this movie captures 70's characters is pretty dead-on and the acting is appreciable.----------------------------------------------------------------Stick with the master Ken Russell on a genre that he has cornered."
2,Disappointing after Cold Sassy Tree,"Burns' work was not completed by herself, and the transition of authors is painfully obvious. While a tribute to Burns was the motivation behind the completion of this book, Burns would have been better served not having her book finished at all.However, the part that was truly Burns' was as brilliant as ever!"
5,great boots,my husband ordered these after suffering through wearing magnums at work who was walking and standing on hard floors all night. the magnums left blisters and were cheaply made we ordered this boots in a size 10.5 w and we thought they would be to wide but they wear perfect no rubbing on the little toes they have a lot of paddling and was so comfortable i will be purchasing another pair for him for the price we paid for these boots and the magnums i was shocked at how better made these were you can just tell by looking at these that they are better made..
2,A compilation of previous PB videos,"The girls were good looking but the camera shots were too fast, switching back and forth. Also, many scenes were from previous videos."
2,Don' Bother,"The only scenes worth waching were the last ones entitled""SEX"" redheads really know how to get it on!"
1,"XML in ""what..."" time?","Warning: Do not buy this book! This was one of the worse technical books ever printed. If you are a serious programmer (which you should be if you are learning XML) you will be wasting your money if you purchase this book. For the first 150 or so pages, it is about HTML and it's basics. It attempted to explain about XML and DTD like other XML books but it seemed like the author lack the knowledge of XML. For every 10 lines of sample XML codes, there are 30 pages explaining each code and syntax. Examples are useless; they have no real world functions besides for displaying on a web browser. If you are looking to learn XML for integration and real world applications, DON'T WASTE MONEY BUYING THIS BOOK."
2,Great for Mormons,"Just fyi, this book is written by a Mormon.As a Christian (who beleives in the Trinity), I'm just not comfortable with that.There are other great parenting books out there for us non-punitive, non-coercive Christian parents (even though we seem to be a rare breed)."
4,"good, but not that good","This album is rather goofy. I really enjoy listening to it sometimes, but it's not as good as it seems. The guitar work is cheesy, the keyboards are cheesy, and singing in key seems to be somewhat of problem for old Isaac. A fun album, but definitely not the roots reggae that I dig.It has a good vibe though, and some of the musicians are really solid."
1,poor,The acting was stunted and not smooth. I have to admit I did not watch the entire production - I could not stand it.
1,Like a high school production.....,"I checked this out at the library and egads..what junk! I am a huge fan of period movies and have seen almost every one out there more than once. So coming across a new one I hadn't seen before, I was quite excited.What a disappointment! The set were very fake, like obvious fake backdrops in the garden and trees. The costumes were a joke. Something a high school seamstress got up. And least of all the stilted and atrocious acting.I couldn't sit through more than 30 min. of this. I fast forwarded to other parts, just as HORRIBLE.If you can check it out at a library, go for it and see. Don't buy it and be extremely disappointed!"
3,Need lots and lots of poison,"I have always wanted a poison ring--so medieval, so Borgia. I shopped around quite a bit until I settled on this one. It isn't represented correctly in the photograph: the stone is much, much smaller (hence t he comment about needing ""lots and lots of poison), and the lock that is supposed to keep the ring closed catches on everything and flips open. I should have sent it back, I know, I know, but I waited too long. I suppose I will glue the ring shut and love everyone too much to poison them...I don't even know what I would use or where I would get it, anyway. Alas, not a ""real"" poison ring, but all it takes is the power of suggestion, right?"
2,Prisoner Fans Rejoice! Faulty Set Two's To Be Exchanged!,"As a consultant on the A&E release, (liner notes, DVD Trivia Quiz, etc.) and as the American Coordinator of ""The Prisoner Appreciation Society"", I can confirm that we were the first to point out the Set Two audio problems to A&E.We were also responsible for convincing A&E to remaster the Set Two DVDs (and tapes) and to have customers be able to exchange them. Details on how to send in your faulty product will be posted on our website (URL shown on the tape and DVD box).I look forward to the new release so my ""two star"" rating can (hopefully) be improved. But as it stands now, I find the Set Two audio track unacceptable. The replacement product will probably be ready by the end of January 2001."
5,"Superb, but soon to be recalled","More episodes of the greatest adventure program ever made for television. There are significant audio problems in set 2. A&E has announced that corrected disks will be issued, probably in mid-December, and trade-ins will be offered for defective copies. Better to wait, then, to get your copies, but a definite must-buy when corrected."
5,Best thing I ever bought,"I bought this wall mount to support a 58"" plasma.The mount is top-notch quality. The instructions were clear and easy to follow.The only thing you need to do is to locate two studs and find their centers. You need to drill two holes per stud.I was able to do this by myself quite easily.Now the screen moves out from the wall about 2 feet, and best yet, can turn left or right by about 45 degrees.Fantastic. I've never been so happy. I have two sofas in the living room so a simple mount that could not allow left or right motion would have made one sofa useless."
2,delivery of the product.,We did not have all the mounting screws-- hardware in the delivered box.I had to call the manufacture who responded right away and mailed us missing parts but they were not correct and complete.Very frustrating!!!!!!
4,Perfect book for the older birder,"I purchased this book for my mother, who is in her 70s. She recently started birding so this was her first field guide-easy to read, large pictures make identification very easy for the beginning birder of any age."
5,Looks like it cost $100,"Brass or brass-looking shower organizers are virtually impossible to find. When I stumbled across this one I snapped it up; as everything else I was looking at cost well over $100. It arrived quickly and looks amazing. I'm considering purchasing a second one... just to have on hand. If I could give it 6 stars, I would."
5,Schools Administrator's Letter Book,This book is my second bible!!! It is so convenient and I strongly recommend it to any upcoming administrators.
1,Frustrating little toy,"We received this toy and immediately opened it for our daughter to play and were surprised to find that it doesn't work properly. We press the bone button and the dog pops up with the bird. We press the green button and the bird pops up with the dog. We press the cheese button and the mouse doesn't pop up at all. EVER. Pushing the animals back down, the dog pops up on his own accord without us touching anything. My daughter quickly grew bored of this toy and it's unpredictability."
2,Can not catch my son's attention,"This toy is too complicated for my 9 month old son. He doesn't know how to push the button. I have to play with him, to push the buttons to make sound. Occasionaly he looks at the toys when I push the buttons. But overall he would like to grab a newspaper to play than listen to the sound."
5,the definitive book on Tim Burton & his films.,"i've always been a big fan of Tim Burton's films and this book fulfills any questions i might've had about this unique filmmaker. like all of the books of this series, it is an exhaustive examination of Burton's life and his films starting from his childhood in Burbank all the way up to SLEEPY HOLLOW. the interviews are very informative and candid (esp. his comments on the aborted SUPERMAN film). Burton isn't known for being the most chatty filmmaker in the world but the interviewer really gets him to open up. if you love Burton's films this book is essential. i'd rank it right up there with the also fantastic Lynch On Lynch and Gilliam On Gilliam books. now, when is Faber & Faber going to do one on the Coens?"
3,It's not bad but a little too descriptive,"I think that what fails this book is that it falls in the middle. It has a lot of first person perspective (which I loved) but also a LOT about ""Burton did this, Burn did that"". If it was stripped of everything, except the first person perspective, I'd probably give it a five star rating.As it is, it's a nice read but probably just for hard-core fans of Burton's work. I love his work, but without falling into aficionado territory."
1,Not very pleased.,"I expected this movie to be a laugh-a-minute, scathing up-to-date political bash with undertones I could relate to. However, it was nothing like South Park. I loved the idea, however, of making a Marionette movie wiht plenty of explosions and setting things set on fire, but the movie just left me unmoved. It was flat, forced, and not at all funny. I was expecting Trey and Stone to take the low road for most of the movie, but I was expecting some cerebral humor. It just doesn't live up to South Park."
1,Very Offensive!,"It wasn't the political content that bothered me. It was the filthiness of the language. I thought that I had heard just about every dirty word there was. However, I was not prepared for the non-stop blasphemy in this movie. The makers of this movie weren't satisfied with the usual renderings of the Lords' name in vain - NO! - they actually created new words, like blasphemy on steroids. I canceled the download before it was halfway complete."
1,"Mean, boring and nauseatingly dumb movie","I can't believe the creators of much loved SouthPark could come up with such brainless nonsense. Great disappointment in the movie, in the uncomplicated political views of its creators, and especially in their outrageous uncivil attacks on people of different views. I wish I could give it 0 stars, minus five would be even better. Never seeing another one of their movies again."
5,A two tissue laugh-jerker....,"There have probably only been 3 or 4 movies I've ever seen in my life that even came close to making me laugh as hard as TEAM AMERICA. I literally laughed until my nose was running. The soundtrack of background music alone is worth the price of admission, the refreshing twist of skewering ""political"" actors is the icing on the cake. If you need a good hard laugh, have a drink and go see this movie. Be prepared to miss parts of it because you will be laughing too hard to hear. Kudos to Stone and Parker...absolutely HILARIOUS."
3,Good Puppet Sex,"Okay, I watched Team America with my 20-year-old daughter and two of her friends. How did I know the puppets would do bodily functions on screen in graphic detail? How did I know the F-bomb would go off every other line? However, I found myself chuckling, laughing, and then rolling on the floor with mirth. What a takeoff on the obligatory movie skin scene, hilarious.Any film that lumps Michael Moore, most of the Hollywood actors of liberal persuasion, and France together with Muslim extremists and Korean Dictators has to be commended. Team America gets to blow all these folks or countries up creatively. Moreover, that is a good thing you moth...."
2,"Ha, ha, ha...NOT!","This movie did nothing for me, it was incredibly corny, and I felt that the writers were whingeing just to hear themselves whinge!I'm giving this movie two stars for the songs, which even though they were childish, still made this otherwise mundane movie bearable."
2,Watch it with no great expectations.,"Everyone had told me about how great this movie was, so I was really excited to see it - I have a very un p.c. sense of humor, and think that South Park is actually not too bad. (except it went over board with the whole AIDS thing, like Team America - that's one thing, along with rape and domestic violence that I think shouldn't be 'made' to be funny)However, this just wasn't funny at all. It was total potty humor - no intelligence at all. The only funny thing was the President of China's song - where every 'L' is pronounced 'R'.I give it two stars due to how well the puppets where handled, and the sets where great - it's visually amazing, so turn down the volume and you'll have a more enjoyable experience."
4,good,"I loved this movie, the reason is that it didn't get five stars is because of the sex scene they put in this movie. South Park has a histroy of mentioning going number one and number two on your lover/sex partner but in this movie they actually show it! I'm sorry but peeing on someone is pushing it for me but actually S***ing on someone ""WHAT THE F**K!"" Mat and Trey, what the hell are you guys into?"
2,Team America World Police,"I was disappointed with the film as a whole even though it started well for me. I bought the DVD primarily because of what the film makers did on the South Park series as well as being a big fan of the Thunderbirds series.The first thirty minutes of the film was great since it not only had the Thunderbird feel but with more edge and more hard core on the action sequence. The film then subsequently faded and dragged on with the story meandering on around the lead character. I was most disgusted with the love scene since it was irrelevant to the film but felt it was created just to turn people off. I could do with vulgar but it was also crude for me and very repulsive.Overall a very credible effort from the makers since it is really hard work putting together a feature length film with marionettes but their jokes and treatment may work fine with a thirty minute cartoon, it became quite unbearable when it went beyond an hour."
1,Crap,"Hey, what else can I say? That's my opinion. Maybe I'm just too old (47) to get the juvenile, excretory ""humor"" of this film, but I just thought it wasn't very intelligent. Lots of stereotypes, bad songs, grossouts, and cursing (mf, f, etc.) make ""Team America"" an exercise in bad taste.It looked like a propaganda film from the Bush administration. American actors (F.A.G.) are made to look like collaborators with Kim Jong-Il, the very strange ""Dear Leader"" of North Korea. Americans who wish blow the hell out of everything are the heroes of this movie. Thing is, I wouldn't have really cared which side the heroes or bad guys were on if this movie was really funny-which it is not. The ""gags"" are gross and disgusting, and not worth laughing at.This was one of those ""not finished"" DVDs, I'm sorry to say. When the dude puked up a Lake Michigan-sized puddle of you-know-what, that was pretty much it."
5,"Hilarious, non stop humor","The makers of this movie and south park (Matt Stone, Trey Parker)are genuises. Non stop jokes about everyone and everything. They go where no other comedians have gone before, with their rough vulgar humor. You'll laugh your heads off at this one."
4,Funny as a fart in an elevator,"Anyone who finds this f*#@*%g film or its cuss content to be offencive should develope a f%@$%#g sense of humor. If you like off the wall humor and movies that think WAY outside the square, then this one is for you.Thunderbirds are a no-show compared to Team America."
5,Funniest flick of the year...for all those that 'get it'.,"You won't like this film much if you: 1) Don't ""get"" South Park-style libertarian humor 2) LOVE Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer action movies 3) Are not ""up"" on current events, both domestic and international (I was asked by someone why it was funny that Hans Blix would send an ""angry letter"" to a WMD-seeking dictatorship) 4) Think ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" was 'fair & balanced documentary' 5) Were moved to tears when they saw ""Rent"" 6) Have a hang-up about sex/profanity in the movies 7) Always HATED ""Thunderbirds"", ""Fireball XL-5"" and other 1960s puppetoons 8) Admire overpaid, spoiled Hollywood actors who ""speak out"" on political issues 9) Live in 'Durka-Durka-Stan'. Unsurprisingly, this is the best American film yet that addresses War on Terror issues. Most of the others I've seen have seemed a bit more...ahem...'wooden'."
3,Not very hot,"I just got this dryer as a replacement for an older Hot Tools Professional Ionic dryer. I relax my hair and use the comb attachment on every dry. This dryer is very light in your hands compared to the old model which is nice. Although it's 1875 watts, it doesn't feel like it gets very hot. My hair too came out pretty frizzy and took a lot longer to dry. I kept wondering if I had it set on low. My hair definitely feels soft, even if it is frizzy. I didn't think it was too loud, but then again, my old dryer is obnoxious so anything sounds better. I do like the 8ft cord and the long prongs on the comb attachment. I'll give this thing one more try but right now, it might be going back to the store."
4,RAW EXPLOSION,"These early home recordings of Daniel Johnston although not professionaly recorded explode with passion and wit. Songs that stand out for me are; from Songs of Pain: ""Grievances"", ""I Save Cigarette Butts"", Urge"", ""Hate Song"". From More Songs of Pain: ""Phantom of My Own Opera"" and ""More Dead Than Alive"". Daniel is a songwriter's songwriter. He was great right out of the gate and these early recordings prove just that."
4,More is nice but not better,"While each of the tracks are good, the additions really feel out of theme of the original album. Nice listening"
5,Favorite Vollenweider Album,"This was purchased to replace a copy that I had years ago. ""White Winds"" is still my favorite Vollenweider album. It arrived in good condition and in a timely manner. Very pleased."
1,Expensive Rental,"This pump lasted me two months and then stopped circulating water. Then Savio got out of even considering meeting its warranty because I had to cut the cord to get the pump sent to them. In other words, don't waste your money by trusting this brand."
1,Overhyped,"I found this book in a consignment store and was very impressed with the ""hype"" on the cover. I was expecting this book to be an expose on how celebrity is made and sold. Instead the book is insubstantial and states the obvious. Nothing illuminating about this book. I do like that the author is an animal rights activist. Yes, the book is an easy read, but it's also extremely shallow -- chock full of facts but lacking in insight. This book is just as shallow, artificial, and irrlevant as the subjects he covers. I was expecting to really enjoy this book but am sorely disappointed."
2,Gets Hype-r about nothing much,"This is a book that doesn't accomplish what it sets out to do, and that is so much worse than succeeding at something less ambitious.Hype seeks to act as a tell-all about the Hollywood celebrity industry, but it wavers between asking the reader for a high level of respect and making crude, unfunny jokes that would be more at home in a celebrity gossip column.The book seeks to shock us, but the revelations aren't really so shocking. Are we so surprised at the prevalence of plastic surgery among the stars? It also seeks to entertain us, but the jokes are lame (such as noting that Jackie Kennedy's hairstyle is as stiff as the white collar shirts she was entertaining that night, ho ho!).Hype doesn't do anything overtly harmful, but I would think that someone looking for dirt could find a much more attractive package than this book."
2,It ain't Mega,Tent came late without the tunnel. I needed both 3 days ago for a scheduled activity. It is pretty tiny. Nothing Mega about this Mega Tent.
5,GREAT!,My kiddo thinks that this is the BEST!! I think that it very well might be his favorite play thing!!
4,Great History Lesson,"This is a great history on giving birth.It is interesting how something can become a birth ""fad"", like x-rays while pregnant, and then in the next few years it is discredited as being dangerous. It makes you wonder what we are doing today that will be too dangerous to do in another couple years."
4,Excellent,I believe that this is a very good introduction to the history of childbirth. The effort of the research put into this book is shown very well throughout the entire book. The complexity of this topic was put to the test as seemingly simple questions became very hard to answer. A lot of interesting facts and previously unknown history is covered within this book. The author wrote the book in a way that many people who read it would be able to decide for themselves. It's a very good read.
2,Trite with Good Moments,"This film, with the exception of the Jane Fonda/Alan Alda exchange, was predictable, trite; and boring. It is hard to decide which wase worse: the Cosby/Pryor or the Mathau segments. The Maggie Smith/Michael Caine portion had its moments but her performance was hardly worth an Oscar. This was clearly not up to Neil Simon's normal level of humor."
2,Disappointing,"I wanted to love this album. I think she is a great artist. But, I just can't get into this one. It came out today and I have heard it twice now. It has mostly gray, vague songs. The album art is mostly hazy and out of focus and that is how this album sounds to me. The music is very sparce and I just can't figure out what its all about."
2,Unsatisfying,"The author does a nice job setting up the story, and developing the characters. However, I was deeply disappointed with the novel's ending. I don't want to give away too much information, but some plot lines seemed far-fetched, and too neatly tied up. I had high hopes for this novel, but was disappointed."
1,"Infidelity explained as ""women are horny""","All of women's marital infidelity is explained away as: it's hormonal and natural as women enter their sexual prime. they turn 30, more testosterone pumps into their system, they get horny, and need sex with multiple partners.if that's what you want to hear, then read the book and you can ignore the other aspects of marriage, including communication and commitment.The book is written as a dialog with her friend ""Kevin,"" in which she teaches him the ways of women. The book is based on a) her personal past of infidelity and b) her interviews with cheating men and women. She's not a doctor and does not have training; she's a ""professional public speaker specializing in career development."""
1,"Women's Infidelity, A book of excuses, to help me forgive my infidelity","The writer admits that she is not a professional. I understand that she has gathered her understandings in the form of conversations.Considering that her answers to the Male speaker is sometimes harsh I guess this book won't even help men.It is mostly an excuse bible for infidel wives so that they can forgive or justify their acts.More interesting the book advertises the right of the women to sleep and have sex with multiple partners and that they should not feel guilt of doing that or even being infidel to their family, breaking them and selling them."
5,Be Advised,"Men, when she says ""I do"" she means ""I do, until I get bored and/or a guy with a bigger/better... um, 'capability' to make me orgasm comes along."" That is it. No kidding, you'll be glad you read this. Worth the money and it's MUCH less than alimony or child support for a kid that's not even yours."
3,Wrong Book,"Package arrived on time in the condition listed; however, it was a grapic novel and not the RPG core rule book.I e-mailed about this mix-up, and have yet to recive a reply."
5,Nice Addition to any RPG Library,"I am an avid gamer for over twelve years. I love collection all types of RPGs cause you never know if you will find something useful.I just got this book and think that my group and I are going to give it a swing. It looks like there are many posiblities for some great roleplaying. I think if you like the show and you are a gamer, you'll like this book."
1,WTF! It doesn't have closed captioned!!!!!!,"Yeah I said WTF! it doesn't have closed captioned. Tough to be deaf and not able to laugh to this fabulous show I watch live on tv. Now I want to own a DVD season....but no, it doesn't have cc or doesn't provid subtitle option. I even contact Warner Brothers, no change. Just sharing my opinion here."
2,"Less shining, more grinding","2 1/2If not for the title track plus a few embellishments, this would easily be dismissed as one of the artist's outdated nineties productions slathered in a corny hip hop influence."
4,Entering a New Phase,"Prince enters his 90's sound with mixed results. As per usual when he tries a new sound, the first album with it isn't as successful as later attempts. The arrangments are interesting but the melodies and catchiness isn't there sometimes. And the rapping isn't really all that great. Still, it does have some amazing songs on it ""Money Don't Matter 2night"" and the title track being just two. It's worth buying: it is a solid album from one of rock's true geniuses."
2,inconsistent at best,"Best track: ""Gett Off"" There are two or three other okay songs here (like ""Cream"", ""Daddy Pop"", ""Money dont matter tonight""). I used to really hate this album back when it came out, but have grown to tolerate it in the wake of Prince's artistic demise. It's far better than much of the antiseptic, boring material he churns out these days."
4,pretty good,"while this single gets a lot of criticism for having all the same song except search and destroy, i think it's really good.while the mixes are all somewhat distinct (my favorite being the rasta mix, which gives it a completely different sound) from the original, it's not necessarily a cd you'd pop into the stereo and listen to straight, more of one that you'd put into a playlist on your mp3. they're all a nice alternative to the album versionalso search and destroy is an awesome cover and i'm an avid lover of the original.well worth the three bucks.(other pepper songs i like are: sir psycho sexy, funky monks, behind the sun, death of a martian, coffee shop, my friends, pea, soul to squeeze, especially in michigan, lovin' and touchin', save the population, can't stop, this is the place, cabron, zephyr song, purple stain... hope that helps)"
5,From Back Cover,"A WORLD OF WATERIn The Jesus Incident Herbert and Ransom introduced Ship, an artificial intelligence that believed it was God, abandoning its unworthy human cargo on the all-sea world of Pandora. Now centuries have passed. The descendants of humanity, split into Mermen and Islanders, must reunite... because Pandora's original owner is returning to life!"
5,This IS a party,"Talking Heads remains one of those enigmatic bands that defy categorizing. Rock? Sometimes. Disco? No. Art-rock? I have no clue what that term is supposed to mean. Any music that has quality and integrity is, by default, art. FEAR OF MUSIC is an extraordinarily cerebral record lyrically, but musically, pretty basic. There is texture to the music but none of the unnecessary complexities or pretensions of the other bands of the era, like Rush. (Ooooh, the drummer is playing in 7/8ths time. Wow!) Having fun was just as important to Talking Heads as was being ""artsy"". ""Animals"", ""Heaven"" and ""Mind"" are actually very witty tunes. ""Cities"" is a romp, and, musically, pretty straightforward rock.In these post 9/11 days, and with the Iraq mess still going on, the radical/activist/underground lyrics of ""Life During Wartime"" has taken on a new and eerie significance. Still, it kicks ass.Talking Heads' ""Fear of Music"" is one of the band's best, if not the best. And it's nothing to fear."
3,This Ain't No Disco,"Although there is just too much dissonate junk (""Drugs,"" ""Electric Guitar,"" etc.) here for me to rate it as great record, FEAR OF MUSIC has some great moments.The first 7 tracks are all very good--I especially like Byrne's no-nonsense guitar at the end of ""Mind""--and ""Life During Wartime"" is the ultimate gallows-goodtime record.The shocker here is the fine-print on the back of the CD, which reveals that the entire album was recorded in two days in the spring of 1978.Two days?!? In 1978 it took Pink Floyd that long to find the On/Off switch on their synthesizers."
3,"Great album, lousy disc. Buy the UK edition instead.","This is one of the best albums of the 1970's, an absolutely brilliant combination of new wave and psychedelia that still sounds startlingly original today. Most critically-acclaimed indie bands of the past 20 years sound drab and ordinary compared to what Talking Heads were doing in their prime.Also, the remastering is excellent. I've heard few CD's that sound as good as this.So why'd I give it only three stars?The trouble is the dual-layered discs that Rhino decided to use. I've tried to play the CD side on three different CD players, including a brand new Onkyo and a brand new Sony. Both had trouble reading the disc and skipped on the last track. All the other Talking Head dual-discs had the same problem.There is good news: in the UK, Rhino released all the Talking Heads records as two disc CD and DVD sets. I'd strongly recommend going to amazon.co.uk and getting those versions instead."
5,Wonderful holiday favorites!,"The choir on this CD are wonderful as they perform classic holiday favorites. Buy this CD, you won't be dissappointed!"
5,80's pop masterpiece; easily top 3 of the decade,"I know the words 'perfect' and 'masterpiece' get bandied around all too often, especially with the British music press, but at the time this album was released, I don't think you could find too many people who didn't like this album as much as we all have. Although the production sounds distinctly dated (somewhat), the songcraft of the album is and remains outstanding, particularly ""When Love Breaks Down"" and ""Goodbye Lucille #1"". It deserves more than 5 stars, but perhaps that's too pompous."
5,Multi-layered instruments elevating to the 80's best lyrics,Prefab Sprout defines what was best about 80's music. Their tragically layered music explores the many nooks and crannies of the defeated crooner. This album powers to the depths of the writer's relationships and the bumbling of maturity. Coupled with outstanding new sounds for the time and mixtures of many different gendre's of influences. . . the music simply encaptures you... pure as a first kiss.
3,Maurice's Room,"I thought the story Maurice's Room should be rated a 3.5. It was good, but it just didn't catch my attention.I liked the story because it was about a boy who had a different hobby from most boys. Maurice collected everything. When somebody collects something and keeps adding and adding to his or her collection, in the end it pays off. When someone in a book collects something, that character usually has a very different point of view about the objects he or she is collecting, and that makes the story interesting.I disliked the book because Maurice didn't have a very busy schedule. He played trumpet, but that was a disaster. There also wasn't any excitement because he had a really boring life. I think he should have gone on some adventures; it might have made the story more exciting."
3,Decent at best.......I expected a little more (2.5 stars),"When I read about the long road these guys have took to get this far and how long they have been around singing back-up for so and so, and so and so, I kind of expected that this would be a great listen. However, I didn't get that with this album. The only stand-out songs on this album are ""Greatest Gift"", ""All Over Again""(my favourite), and ""Conqueror"". After those songs, the entries are, to me anyway, non-ambitious i guess, if that's a word. I still haven't heard their 1st album yet but if this is what the second album sounds like, I won't be expecting much from the 1st effort. However, they have dedicated their bodies, minds, and spirits to the Most High, so they got that part right. I'll still support you guys, but come better next time around."
5,Get one while they last!,This cookbook offers many delicious recipes. The color photographs that accompany each recipe allow even the beginning cook to prepare beautiful and tasty meals with ease and confidence.
4,Good balls for the price,"Pros-cheap-decent qualityCons-not 3-starI've played table tennis for many years and can tell you these aren't the best balls; however, they're a good buy for the price and worthwhile for anything short of tournament play."
2,Don't be fooled by 3-Star indication,"Don't be fooled by the 3-star indication in the title for this ball. This is not the same as a 3-star ITTF approved ball quality. If you are looking for a tournament quality ball, stick with the Butterfly, JOOLA, or Killerspin branded 3-star (ITTF approved) balls. I will contend that this is a good quality training ball but if comparing quality with the above mentioned brands this would compare to a training or 1-star ball. I would give this a 4-star rating if it were called a training ball but as a 3-star ball I would give it zero stars as the quality just isn't there."
5,GO GO Table Tennis Balls,These are excellent balls for training and even for compition use. Very well balanced.Material excellent as it provides true bounce.Very highly reccommended.
2,Price is good but quality is poor,"The 3-star rating cannot be ITTF approved, as the balls are not even round. These balls might be OK for multi-ball practice or for robot, but they are not definitely not good even for matches. Avoid these balls if your playing style is looping."
5,An excellent aid for your golf game!,"As someone wholly unfamiliar with the practice of yoga, I had the occasion to use this tape. Immediately following the workout I felt better, almost like having visited a chiropractor! Without dwelling on any kind of spirituality, this tape consists of easy-to-do exercises and poses that result in increased flexibility and an overall sense of physical well-being. As well, it did absolute wonders for my golf game! It literally took a few strokes off of my game and I would highly recommend this tape to anyone to use before a round of golf. It added both distance and accuracy to my irons, as well as good overall conditioning for the round."
3,"Solid Series, but bad cueing from instructor","She does have a nice tone, and she describes the poses well, but her cueing is awful! She'll say, ""Inhale,"" then pause, so I inhale, then she'll ""...as you lift into the pose."" She talks so much about form, that she doesn't tell you when to switch or release--even in poses where you are supposed to be looking at the floor. So, you have to constantly watch, which ruins your form. Maybe if you were to do the program several times and memorize it (or if you have a good sense of timing on your own), this would be okay. The series are generally pretty solid."
5,Inspiring and activating,"Read straight through or pick and choose topics (eg re voting, online activism, the media, and more) - either way, it is fun to read and full of ideas. They say they wanted to use 100, but finally focused on the 50 personal stories chosen from over 2,500, and I am sure that was a challenge.It was fascinating to read the distilled experience of the 50 people whose stories are here - more than once they were the stories behind campaigns and actions that I have heard of and appreciated but had not known how they got started.If you like the positive message about how ""one person can make a difference"" you will love this book. Also if you love the Margaret Mead quote about a small committed group changing the world, that could fit too!As for me, I am going to buy multiple copies for my son and all his graduating senior friends.Fifty ways to love your country - a good positive and practical message for anyone from kids up to the most senior among us."
1,Not very useful,"There is so much filler in this DVD that the educational content is about 5 minutes. They were trying to take artistic licence, understandable, but they lost sight on what the DVD is for. Learning and expanding what you know."
1,More Art Ed than Sex Ed!,"This video is terrible! The positions aren't explained well at all, and there are about ten in all. Most of the time, you are watching some African chick with hairy armpits or a middle aged Indian lady dancing around. The rest of the time, you are staring at Japanese wood-cut prints, which totally turned off my wife! If you've ever been to the zoo, or seen a horny dog in action, than you have seen more than what's presented in this DVD. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
5,Charro,All you people who didn't like the Charro dvd I would like to buy it please let me know if you are interested in selling it
1,The boy was 16? Sure . . .,The age of consent in New York is 17. So that means the boy who was a senior applying to college was only 16 . . . Driver's license is available at 17 . . . They can say the child was conceived outside the state in a state with an age of consent of 16.This is pure fantasy.
3,This season is not as good as the first two,I gave the first two seasons 5 stars..this Madoff plotline is a bit tiresome....it's okay though. Still worth a watch. Glenn is always good.
2,Subtitles Portuguese,"With approximately 280 million speakers,Portuguese is the 5th most spoken language in the world,the 3rd most spoken language in the Western Hemisphereand the most widely spoken in the southern hemisphere of the Earth.Why not add in subtitles?"
5,Wonderful,All I can say is see it for yourself but if you haven't seen Damages please watch from season one its great and trust me you will enjoy every bit of it.
2,Boring,Barely entertaining. Doesn't come close to the excitement of the first two season's. Next season we will probably buy one episode at a time.
3,Damages 3,"Better than season two, getting a bit one dimensional character wise. Intriguing nevertheless . And I like it when there is personel change..."
3,Could've been much better,"The 3 stars are no reflection whatsoever on Elvis' performances, which are outstanding as ever. However, for some unknown reason, the producers of this DVD have chosen to repeat a number of the performances that appear in Volume 1 of the series. (All three volumes are available as a box set).The sound and picture quality, considering the age of the footage, is fanstastic. Certainly if the review was based purely on this aspect, it would be given 5 stars.Bono (of U2) narrates, but puts no passion into it. I know he's an Elvis fan, but for some reason he comes across as if he's bored by the whole thing. Unfortunately, this detracts from some of the performances.Overall, a good DVD to own, but one that could've been much better had more thought gone into it. If you don't happen to own Volumes 1 and 2, you'd be better off purchasing the box set, rather than buying this individual DVD."
2,Strap pops off!,"This would be a pretty good bra if the adjustable strap didn't slip off when you move around. I sewed the hooky thing more tightly into the loop, but it still slips off. The bra is comfortable and the cotton is great for hot days, but even without the hook problem I would only give it 3 stars as the side supports show up under my shirts. This will have to be a stay-at-home bra."
2,Definitely not going to use as a sports bra.,"I understand that I wear a size 38DDD, but I still feel that even if I wore a smaller size, this bra would do nothing for me. It is like a normal bra and will be used as such. It gives less support than some normal bras that I have had for over a year, a medium amount of lift and if I wore this to run, I would probably get hit in the face with a boob. No lie. The fabric is thin and does not ""hold you in"" as a sports bra really needs to do to be effective. Two stars because it does not do what it is intended to do. If you are looking for a good sports bra, I would definitely not recommend this one. If you want a ""lounging around the house, comfortable cleaning bra"" then yes, this would work for you."
2,Very thin,"With all the great reviews, I knew I had to try this bra. Well, it is going back to Amazon. It is so thin and feels flimsy. I'm going back to Champion!"
4,As big as a house,Very comfortable bra. Does what I want it too. The elastic band and the underwire cups mean it is firm but supportive and comfortable. The underwires are U shaped which make the whole bra look huge and means the underwires come up almost to the top of my boobs. Not very sexy though the colour helps.
4,Very Comfortable,"This bra is very comfortable. I would recommend it for light exercising, only. I have bought two but you must take note that in some cases the top of the bra will stick out. It does not bother me because I am very adept at sewing. Some people would prefer to where the item right out of the box. In those cases I would not recommend this bra."
2,No Clip,This is a quality case but it if you plan on carrying hand free you'll need a belt cause there's no clip. It's of no use if you have shorts or warm ups.
3,Actually an Improvement,"Gary Numan's ""extended"" albums never really made sense to me until this one. This is the first one where the album's emphasis is on its feel - the dark despair of a non/anti-religious world. The tracks here build upon that feeling to bring the atmosphere even further up front. I can't whole-heartedly recommend it - I must admit to preferring Gary Numan songs as songs rather than soundscapes. However, if the samples intrigue you, by all means, go for it."
2,Unreliable Product,"I used to work next to a rack of servers. I got these headphones, and for the first week they worked very nicely. Then the right earphone started to do weird things. I got a refund and tried again.The next pair worked fine for longer time (months). But now when you turn the noise cancelling function on, they make significantly more noise than before, to the point that if you are in a not very noise place you have to turn it off. Still helps in flights, but that's not aceptable for a $100 headphones."
3,Good headphones but leak too much sound,"These headphones are extremely comforatable, sound very good, and the noise cancellation worked well. Ultimately, I had to return them because they leak too much sound and I was worried it would disturb my coworkers.I purchased a pair of JBL Reference 410 headphones (on-ear type) instead. They were only $30.00 but they sound as good if not a little better than the Panasonics. Also, they leak very little sound. They also have an inline volume control and fold up very nicely."
3,"Designed for noise-canceling, but","I just purchased the phones and am already not completely satisfied. I am usually an optimistic person, but I have to say that they don't cancel much sporadic noise during quiet listening environment. They do cancel the computer fan noise, but not people talking. I tried to snap my fingers with the noise-canceling function on and off, and didn't see any difference. They are probably good for plane travel, as noted by other reviewers. But when in quiet situations, you can hear a little background noise that is added to them, probably curcuit noise, or ""pink noise"", like 1 reviewer said. With the button turned on, the sound from the phones just seemed to shift up a notch in tone, that's all. Still could hear the faint noise from dishes clanging in the kitchen."
5,excellent product,THE PANOSONIC NOISE REDUCTION HEADPHONES PERFORMED JUST AS THE MANUFACTURER CLAIMED. THEY MADE MY LAST PLANE TRIP MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE. I DID NOT HAVE THE USUAL HEADACHE WHEN LEAVING THE PLANE.
4,Great Movie,I saw this movie many years ago. I wasnt sure I liked it at first until they started playing Portishead in it. Its a black and white vampire movie. It has a very classic style to it. Very interesting check it out. If the movie doesnt get your attention the music will.

4,Interesting and Educational!,"""Peoples of China's Far Provinces"" covers an area largely closed to foreigners, yet home to at least ten ethnic minorities (China has 55 minority groups, totaling about 67 million people.) Prior to the People's Republic taking over some did not allow outsiders into their areas.Following the collapse of the Chinese Nationalists in 1949, the Communists reasserted China's age-old claim to the territory of Tibet, but allowed self-government except for military and foreign affairs.""Lasers"" tells of the growing uses for this new tool, including disclosing fingerprints on materials previously thought no possible, welding, cutting, drilling, helping surgeons, fiber-optic communications, and checkout scanners. Unfortunately, the obvious limitation of articles reporting on technology is that they quickly become dated."
4,I love Tom Green.,"This show is awesome. They dvd was delivered quickly, and I watched it as soon as I opened the package. I wish I would have paid closer attention, because this isn't the The tom Green Show... Its more of a documentary about the tom green show. It was still interesting, though. "")"
1,I Wish This Had Been Reviewed Before I Bought It,"This DVD has a totally misleading title. It is fully censored, and to top it off, the cast keeps interrupting the skits being showed. Seriously, let me get you straigt--the cast commentary is not all that bad, and some viewers may actually be intereseted in it--but the fact of the matter is that they spend more time on interviewing the cast then showing the skits. To make matters NOT ONE SKIT IS SHOWN IN ITS ENTIRETY. You will see more if you watch the show on TV. You will sit down to watch this video and think ""well, they still bleep out all the words and blur the ... , but at least I have some of the funny skits on tape"" WRONG. You will see your favorite skits WITH SUBSTANTIAL PORTIONS MISSING. Each skit is only about half as long as it would be if it was airing on MTV itself. I am much dismayed ... ."
3,Comedic Genius.....Not The Best Video,"Hey, I've been a BIG Tom Green fan from day one. I can remember what it was like when he still lived in Ottawa, Canada....and he did a very independent show on a Canadian network, writing and filming it himself....with a little help from his friends. AND...it was already UNCENSORED!.....The whole show was completely raw until MTV bought it, and turned it into a mockery of what it used to be. And Now My Video Summery..........I can't believe those writers and editors at MTV. They talk as though they came up with the whole idea of the ""Tom Green Show"" and they never ONCE mention the many years of FUNNIER success he had in Canada. Oh yeah....and what's with all the interviews?....I thought this video was called ""Tom Green Uncensored"", not ""Behind The Scenes Of MTV"" I have nothing against Americans, but you people will never experience Tom Green like we experienced him in Canada, when he was at his prime, completely raw and insane!!!!!Tom........We Miss You!"
3,Looks can be deceiving.,"I'm not sure what weird angle or other camera trickery Amazon used to take the controller's pic. I didn't buy this because I wanted a superior controller; as long as it functioned equally as well, I'd be fine. I bought it for its visual quality. Or in simpler terms, 'coz it was pretty. Well, the controller got here, and...it barely looks like the picture. The design and everything is the same, but it's not so light and shiny like the picture makes it out to be. It's darker, and more transparent, so you can see the circuitry, which ruins the whole look for me.If you want a great controller, I'm sure this is one, but visually it's fairly ugly, unlike as is advertised. Another lesson of seeing something in real life before you actually buy it."
1,"Just average music, with dumb lyrics","As most of the people here in Uruguay I have heard of the peyote asesino as the local sensation. In my opinion is far from being a sensation, the music is bad and the lyrics are nonsense. Look elsewhere."
3,CASH MONEY TIL THE DAY THEY BURY ME.,WHAT'S UP TRU I USE TO LIKE YOU GUYS ALOT BUT NOW I DON'T.DON'T GET ME WRONG YA'LL STILL HAVE SOME SONGS THAT I LIKE SUCH AS HOODY HOO. BUT ITS ALL ABOUT THE CASH MONEY ARMY. THEY ARE TAKING OVER THE DIRTY SOUTH. YA FEEL ME CUZ IT'S ALL GRAVEY BABY.
5,N O L I M I T Shocker What Does That Spell NO LIMIT NO LIMT,Yo This Is One Of The Best No Limit Cd's.. Its A Must Have.. I Just Want To Shout Out To No Limit On This Perduction.. Why Wasn't Mystikal In This Cd? Why Wasn't P In Snoops Cd.. THIS CD IS THE BOMB.. I WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO JESS AND MY TRU SOLDIERS.. I LOVE NO LIMIT AND MY JESSICA..WE NO LIMIT SOLDIERS I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
2,"Got only two great songs need more p, c, and silk","I think that the cd wold have been alot better if they had more songs by p,c, and silk. I mean come on they are the ones in the only two good songs. But hoody hoo is great!!!!"
1,THIS IS A DISGRACE TOO ALL THE OLD NO LIMIT ALBUMS,"Where oh where has No Limit gone these past 8 months? The best cd they've come out with in that time period is Magic, and everything else has just been stupid. They are tryin' to have way too many artists and none of them are good plus they all sound the same. Plus it seems like they are just puttin albums out just to make a quick buck and not thinking about quality. Every song on here is just average and below average, they better get it together cause Cash Money is takin' over. I could write tons more mistakes No Limit has made in the past 8 months but that would take up this whole page. If you actually think this cd is tight you need to check out the old No Limit albums."
3,"Silly, sexy, but mostly silly",Akiho Yoshizawa is extremely sexy... but her acting skills are limited to adult situations. The movie is silly with no real plot--but I wasn't expecting anything more than that.
5,THIS IS A GET UP GET HYPER TOON,"THIS IS TIGHT.I LIKE ENERGY THE LYRICS,AND THE BEATS.I LIKEN THIS TOON TO LLCOOLJS ROCK THE BELLS THE MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL THEME WAS PURE GENIUS.THIS IS A DEFINITE CLUB,BUMP IN YOUR CAR IN YOUR BASEMENT SONG PEACE OUT"
1,bad,this doesn't work tellin you then truth i bought one and it didn't work don't the astropad either it also doesn't work don't buy ones like this buy the ones made by dreamcast the are the originals so they work for sure
2,I just don't get it.,"Maybe it's because I'm not American, but I just don't get the hype. There are some good tracks on this CD, e.g. Shame, but a great deal of it, although it may be 'clever', is unlistenable."
3,A great voice and great songs; Lousy Production,"Randy Newman is as awsome as ever, but Tchad Blake and Mitchell Froom produced the life out of this CD.10 stars for Randy. 1 star for for Froom and Blake.Too bad."
3,Not in the best shape,The book's front cover was torn and looked like a sticker had been ripped off which also ripped off the author's name and some of the illustration. Several pages were worn and one looked like it had a coffee stain on it.
5,Good mini-DV digital tape for HV20,"I have been using these mini-DV tapes for canon HV20 camcorder.No issues to report. Good to use, Videos look great."
4,Almost as good as the movie!,"This revealing documentary follows the entire filming process of one of the defining movies of the decade. Thanks to this film we can see George Clooney fighting off females in a bar, Juliette Lewis doing karaoke and Quentin Tarantino giving a wonderful masterclass in comedy. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the film is the background fear of a union strike and the set that blew up a bit too much. I definitely recommend watching this film and seeing how this fantastic movie was made."
2,Didn't last 4 months before stopped working,"This watch seemed like a good product until it started ""getting behind"" on time and then stopped working altogether after about 4 months. We contacted the manufacturer to get a replacement, and we were offered a choice of 3 clearly inferior quality watches. After pointing this out to them, we were ultimately given a better watch than the watch we originally purchased."
4,Good padding,I like these little pads but I have to admit that they can sometimes be pricey especially if you buy them and it doesn't solve your shoe problem.
2,Not too great,"I bought this c.d. because my favourite singer, Maire Brennan sings a duet on it and I like Michelle Tumes, too. Drop Michael McDonald and the song would have been perfect for Maire's voice and her life (read her autobiography, you'd understand) but this c.d. is not great. They get old (especially that Jaci Valesquez song). The ones I love the best are the last four performed by the Irish Film Orchestra with vocals by Michelle Tumes and Maire Brennan. If the whole c.d. could have been like that, it would have been pure Heaven."
5,Streams,"""Streams"" is a wonderful CD that is perfect for a ""new"" listener of Contemporary Christian. The Baby Boomers will recognize Michael McDonald in ""Don't Give Up."" It allows the novice the opportunity to hear many of the performers on Spinner.Com. You won't be disappointed!"
3,review,"The item is a school book for class but the amazon seller was easy to work with, got the book on time and in great condition."
3,Winner....,"To begin is Fortunes of War, in an insanely great remix. Bryan made this song better than the original version. International Killer, one of my favorite songs from the X-trax, was butchered, in my opinion. The vocals were ruined and made the song unbearable for me to listen to for more than a minute-sorry Bryan. Civil War was really cool to listen to, the vocals seeming to be completely gone was really interesting. Also, the usage of sampling in this remix was a new one to me-really cool. Now on to Funker Vogt, they remix Futile very nicely with the very heavy and calm bass beat-it just wraps me up. Malfunctoin was ok, but did not open my eyes. The Dead was on the same general level as Malfunction. Even though Funker Vogt is my favorite out of the whole music scene, I name the winner to be VAC, just because Fortunes of War was awesome and Civil War was very cool. VAC won 2 songs to Funker Vogt's 1. Three stars for three great songs on the album. Not for newbie fans either."
3,Okay beginner's guitar,"I haven't played guitar for about 20 years and wanted to pick up something to re-learn. So, this was a good choice for the price. It has little adjustment flexibility and one string broke within the first 24 hours. Not sure, yet, that it's a keeper, but I have only owned this for 48 hours. I would have preferred being shown other acoustic guitars in the $100-$250 price range, to see if I would have enjoyed playing another guitar more. The neck on this remains wide; perhaps I would have done better with one that is narrower. My hands are becoming arthritic and it's hard for them to get into position for chords. Since I bought a Service Plan, I'm hoping the store will let me trade up to something more usable for my hands. Any suggestions?"
5,Professional Guitar,"I had my fingers crossed while unpacking the packaging.As i dug the inside the true box of guitar, it reveled a black colored guitar with awesome finish and material. I felt this one is indeed a rich guitar for 99 bucks.I took it which was already tuned and played few tunes and it sounded fascinating.I really liked my purchase thank you Epiphone for such wonderful product."
1,Disappointment.,"I didn't expect anything more than basic functionality form this when I bought this simply because I didn't plan on spending a fortune on a guitar I only need to get me through a deployment in Afghanistan. Right out of th box I had dead frets. The neck looked a bit bowed so I loosened the strings to get the truss rod and -gasp- NO TRUSS ROD. But an allen wrench came with it so that became f***ing useless. I even bought a bigger saddle to raise the strings a little higher and perhaps cancel out the dead frets. Nope. After a month it just kept getting worse and worse until I got fed up with this piece of garbage, smashed it, and threw it in the burn pit. I expected a lot more from a guitar with the Gibson name. Hell, I just wanted it to WORK. I've been playing guitar for about 8 so I'd like to think that I know what a guitar should sound like and this guitar was comparable to a FirstAct guitar. It was a complete waste of money."
4,Vintage early Acuff-a must listen to event bar the cost!,"Ever wonder what young, early Roy sounded like? Here's your chance to find out.These are 16 cuts culled from the early part of his career. You find the themes herein that made Acuff a household name with songs like ""The Southbound Train"", ""When I Lay My Burden Down"" and others.This is also as country as it comes. This is not the later, more polished Roy Acuff. Some of this is pretty stone cold country. You almost grimace at the phrasing on ""Drifting Too Far From The Shore""!Some drawbacks, though. This is the re-release of a 1984 LP by the same name hence making it a short running time for a CD. There are absolutely no liner notes, just advertisement for other product, so it doesn't quite gel as a ""Historic Edition"". If you wonder what the red checkmarks are about on the back, those are previously unissued performances.Buy this, listen a time or two and put it away for a while and then listen again-it's a keeper."
3,Disappointed,"I recently purchased the Farberware Select Series 8"" and 10"" skillets and they were perfect so I decided to get the larger ones. When I received the Farberware Accents 10-1/2"" and 12"" skillets it was surprising how light they were. As for the size the 12"" skillet holds six pounds of hamburger! The skillet cooks evenly and food slides right out. These skillets are a less expensive alternative that will work well enough until you upgrade to the Select Series."
4,Prajakta,"Great product and suited for its value. My only concern is the metal handle that tends to get heated very fast! For anyone making stir fry, be careful as the handle gets heated faster than food!"
1,Duplicates entries constantly,"I used to have a perfect sync between outlook and my blackberry with blackberry's software. I ""upgraded"" to android and bought this product to sync outlook with my phone. Huge mistake. Constantly duplicate appointments. Sometimes on different days. Basic good design is missing - when I am looking at today on the calendar and I add an appt, why does it not add it to today? It picks some random date...I could live with all the idiosyncracies but the bad syncing, duplicate entries, who knows how else it screws up my data (I have 5 copies of ppls birthdays, some span a week now... on different dates....) is unforgivable. That's the basics for this type of program."
1,Not worth the trouble,"I have had nothing but trouble with this product. Everytime I try to sync my iPaq, the program shuts down. It worked beautifully when I used the free trial. As soon as I paid for it, nothing worked. I've tried to get help from the company, again nothing. Save your money."
1,Elderly bigots pleased with themselves,"Hart-Davis' famous correspondence with G W Lyttelton in six volumes is full of bigoted sneers at 'coal-black clergyman' and 'pansies',and in general shows two self-satisfied elderly bigots congratulating themselves on their exclusivity and taste. That said, it is only fair to say that it was published in 1952 when non-homophobes were rare - and of course even today we have the christo-fascist hate-culture of modern America, where even supposedly liberal types like Obama say they oppose gay marriage because they are christian !!"
2,The low point of Ozzy's career,"Poor production is the downfall of this album - reflects the sames tinny, shallow sound that dominated the genre at the time. Lyrically, this stands up to other Ozzy releases, but it just isn't pleasant to listen to. Much, much better are any live rendetions of the tracks on this record, especially the hit, ""Shot in the Dark,"" on JUST SAY OZZY.Of interest to Ozzy devotees, but not recommended for the curious collector starting out. Try BLIZZARD OF OZZ or TRIBUTE as a starter instead."
1,Not enough real research,"Considering the length of this book's bibliography I had supposed that it would offer some real insight into the moon and its effects. What I got was a lot of superstition, personal conjecture and rehashed mistakes. The assumption that thousands of years ago humans did not pay attention to the wandering bright stars we now know as planets is just one of the many misguided statements. Instead of reading and quoting real anthropological or historical studies about the moon the author relies on supposition and non-scholarly sources to create this book.If the author had declared her intent to write about her own supposition, experience and conjecture and then had really done so it would have been a much better book than this mismash attempt.The writing itself is disjointed and awkward. I would recommend giving this a miss, unless you really need to fill out your book shelves, or are rabidly collecting calendar, moon or astrological information."
4,Excelent for the price!,"I bought one of these for me, and another for my son. We have both been wanting to learn to play for years, and I thought it would be good for us to learn together. I was impressed with the quality as soon as I opened the case.When we took these in to our local music shop, the first question he asked was how much we paid. I had to show him the invoice before he believed me. In his words, ""A DAMN good instrument for that cheap!"" Mine tuned in beautifully, the fine tuners made the job pretty easy. My son's was another thing. As soon as he started tuning it in, (nowhere near in tune yet) the small nut that holds the gut (the loop that holds the tailpiece down) slipped completely off. It was a simple $9.00 fix, and all was well in just a few minutes. We have been learning in leaps and bounds and loving every minute of it ever since."
2,Not that good.,"Although the shipping was pretty fast, the item wasn't that good. I know it was only $100, so I should not have expected something really nice. Maybe it was the transportation, but the rosin case came broken. That's okay, but the fine tuner on the E string was also broken. It keeps falling out of place, so I had to be careful with the tuning of this string. The neck also has a problem. It isn't completely painted. Another thing about this violin is that there is a number 43 written in pencil, which you cannot erase (or at least I don't think you can). I guess the one I bought was #43rd violin for that batch haha. Also, it might have just been my luck, but I would not recommend this violin."
1,Sent wrong item a week before Christmas!,"I ordered a 4/4 full-sized cello from this company as a Christmas present. It came on time all right-- but they sent me a toy-sized cello! ""4/4"" means adult sized. The one I got in the mail must have been about a 1/4, or even a 1/8. It weighed five pounds! This would have been funny if it hadn't wasted precious time needed to return it and get the right gift with only a week to go! And of course they won't pay shipping and handling and are keeping 20% of the purchase price, so I'm out considerable money because of their mistake. What were they thinking??"
1,Delivered Damaged - Returned,"Below is a list of the problems that resulted in my immediate return of this item...- Multiple scratches, blemishes & scrapes on the front of the violin- Strings were bent in several places presumably from poor storage- Bridge is very poor quality- 1 of the fine tuners is broken and the remaining 3 are warped- Wood shavings sticking up around the f holes- Pencil scribbling on the fingerboard- The instrument was obviously strung in a hurry and was done very sloppily"
1,The watch you can't fasten.,"The watch came in a great looking case, the face of the watch was attractive. Then - oops couldn't fasten it because there was no fastener. It came with a return address slip for sending it back - which is nice. But I'd rather get what I thought I ordered."
1,It;s a clock,Nothing big here it's go's around and tells time.Not real good time if I think about it. It may have stop some time a go and is now on 11:00 I think.
1,1 star for glowiness,"This controller really bites. The joystick is very thin and brittle. On most N64 controllers, the joystick gets [bad] and loose after a year or two. On this controller, it get ruined in about a month. Do NOT get this terrible controller unless you just want to stare at it in the dark."
2,too big,its too big and i needed it for my wedding... the seller was right on it then when i wanted to send it back i guess he lost my number! LOL he didnt give me any info to return... soo there it sits in its pretty little box... anyone wanna buy a ring?
5,Beatiful record,"This so-called die hard fans are not what they claim. As a band Pavement had a natural process of evolution wich i really dig. I believe the music has gotten tighter of course and to me Terror Twilight is their best album yet, the most crafted and beatiful. Every album speaks for its period of time and this one does too in an incredible way, too bad fans can't see it that way, What were you expecting?, Slanted & enchanted and crooked rain were great too, in their time, but i would be disappointed seeing the band release this couple of albums forever. Besides that, Hi-Fi is a lot better and makes perfect justice to their music.P.S i just hope they don't split."
5,Is it the last greatest pavement album?,"...Nothing lasts forever...and for Pavement it's not different. They said that they will give time for them to take care of their personal projects and maybe they will stop with the band...Anyway T.T. is a masterpiece that reflects the evolution and the great moment of the band...Great Melodies, sad songs, intelligent lyrics..it reminds me Sonic Youth Daydream Nation (another essential album). For Brazilian fans i can say that we have lucky...the Brazilian T.T. was realeased last year with promotional price and with bonus tracks. The Bonus Tracks are: 1.Harness Your Hopes 2.Roll With The Wind 3.The Porpoise And The Hand Grenade Another good tip: Major Leagues EP has a cover song from Echo and the Bunnymen ""The Killing Moon"" These Bonus Tracks are from Spit On a Stranger Single. Great oportunity for brazilian fans who don't have enough money to import Pavement's singles!"
3,between here and there is betta than either here or there!,"Pavement records used to make me deliriously excited and happy. Crooked Rain was the soundtrack to my early twenties and S&E '91 is still the most definitively cool record of the decade. Nice-looking, suburban boys in dress shirts and nice haircuts making the most beautifully trashy music. What happened? The music is still better than 95% of what's out there -- but I must admit that Madonna's Ray of Light is more exciting than any track on Terror. Perhaps SM should get a day job so that his mind must devise ingeniously wicked melodies and anarchic lyrics to escape the boredom and confinement of the time-card."
4,Pavement proves it again,"Nobody should have ever doubted that this album would be amazing. Pavement has created a unified album with the same amount of lyrical quirkiness and musical talent that has won fans over for years. They continue to move towards obvious folk and country influence, without losing their ability to craft a pop song with bite. The only drawback is for uninspired production."
1,Worst experience ever,Send me a generic/universal car kit instead of real car kit and off course it did not work no contact # for customer service on their website. Goods arrived late. WORST POSSIBLE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE will not recommend to anybody
4,"A little small for tots, but older puzzle lovers will love these.","I bought these for my 4-year-old nephew, who can take apart and put together ""anything."" Well, we'll see. Perfect airplane or car entertainment. Just be careful around toddlers or if you have pets, since the pieces are small."
2,A Mother's Subjective Point of View,"This was clearly written from a mother's subjective point of view. While it included many of Margie's accomplishments, it did little to describe how she actually overcame obstacles in her path toward professional Grand Prix riding. How did she obtain exclusive rights to horses from Hidden Creek's stables? How did she manage entry and travel fees before she was a recognized rider? How did her size help or hinder her riding? One reviewer's statement that this was written from a ""mother's, third person objective point of view"" is comical. No mother can write about a child, of whom they are so obviously proud, objectively. This was clearly from a mother's subjective point of view. This could certainly be considered a ""delightful diversion"" by any pre-teen. Serious riders should stick with the Chronicle of the Horse for factual ""objective"" information. And I,too, question why the Kelton Family's review was left twice."
4,An 80's classic!,"This is a great CD to listen to in the car while driving along the ocean. Always brings back memories of good times. I'm surprised these guys aren't very well known anymore. They combined the best of the Police, the Cars, and the Beatles into a very unique and satisfying sound. Tony Lewis is a great vocalist and John Spinks is a very underated songwriter and guitarist."
2,A big disappointment,"I love everything about food so was really looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, I found it to be a huge disappointment. While there are certainly some very interesting anecdotes on how elite restaurants operate as well as some great cooking tips and ideas, the vast majority of the book is dull and repetitive. The books is effectively a journal of daily life in the restaurant and the author is probably the only person not to realize that most days in a kitchen (just like at any job) are pretty much the same. Nonetheless, she doesn't hesitate to point out each time a customer order a soup or if (brace yourselves) a table of four decides to order five appetizers."
3,"Should have been a long article, not a book","This book is a year-long, behind-the-scenes look at a New York restaurant, DANIEL, whose chef/owner, Daniel Boulud, was attempting to re-gain his four-star rating from the New York Times. I read this after watching the series ""Restaurant"" and it was a good follow-up to the show. They are entirely different restaurants, but had many things in common and it was easy for me to picture the goings on at DANIEL.Brenner covered both the ""front of the house"" and the area behind the kitchen doors. We met reservationists, the maitre de, Daniel, waiters and bus boys, chefs and line cooks. We learn about VIP seating, wine buying, and much about the backbreaking and stressful jobs involved in running a fine restaurant.The best parts were what I would call the gossipy stuff and the food descriptions.Unfortunately, this book should have been a long article. It was incredibly repetitive and the author's bias toward (adoration of?) Boulud was very distracting."
1,"Not worth buying, better invest in food...","This book should have at the most 100 pages, the writing should have been more concise, deviations are plentiful. It is obvious, the writer tried hard to come up with her 300 pages. Why do I have to read about the travels from the assistant pastry chef? The many repetitions of what's going on in the kitchen, how the service, etc. are organized, are quickly tiresome.The only good thing: one admires even more the excellent food at Daniel and realizes, that the prices are not high considering what all goes into one single dish."
4,Quick exam reference guide,"I found this PMP Exam Cram 2 more condensed than the other PMP exam guides. If you don't have enough time to finish all detailed PMP study books, this book could save you. It consolidated my understanding of several key areas. This book was one of my valuable guides for my exam efforts, and I passed PMP on my first try."
5,"""All - PMP's - THIS IS A MUST HAVE""","I feel as though the authors are communicating vital PM info not only from a class-room perspective but more importantly...a real world perspective. That is what works!!! This book offers all the keys that will lead you to a succssful end result...I say it is a MUST HAVE :-)for any novice or veteran PMP. Results...""The 5 P's - Prior Planning Prevents Poor Performance"""
1,Confederacy of Dunces,"Adrian Mole has become Ignatious O'Reilly.Outright plagarism of ""Confederacy of Dunces"" by John Kennedy Toole or just character theft?Either way it's a cheap move on Townsend's part."
5,See Dee Baby,"Dunno where these people got these copies of Stromboling from but it wasn't from us. If you want to buy a legitimate copy pop over to C D baby dot comCheers,Tracie."
1,not happy,"This bracelet broke immediatly when my daughter tried to put it on her wrist.Very poor construction,DON'T waste your money!!"
1,Pretty - but .....,I bought these as little gifts for 3 of my elementary school students. Two of the bracelets broke the very first attempt the girls put them on.
1,JUNK,"I bought these for my daughter and her friends. While they look beautiful and appear to make a great gift, the minute you put them on your wrist or take them off they break and millions of beads go everywhere. Please dont waste your money. They are cheap pieces if JUNK!!"
4,"A bit clumsy, but does the job well","Very usuable, comftrable to carry (using both straps).Holds a lot of items without any problem, solved all my packing problems (I use this bag daily)."
3,Memorable and Disturbing,"The Smell of Apples by Mark Behr, was an exciting novel to read. The book was filled with discription on each page, and will give the reader the image of what is happening in their head. Like watching a movie play inside your mind. That was the memorable part. The disturbing part, which lost rating, was the discription used during the sexual encounters in the novel. Some of these images you just don't want in your head. It's good read, personally it took me a couple days to realize. I was still grossed out by one scene between a boy and a man until i realized what a great novel it is. I recomend this novel to anyone who needs a good reading."
5,What you see is what you get.,"Good quality and delivery. No surprises, photos have enough detail to choose the right article."
5,Crying for A Criminal,"I never believed I could cry for a criminal. I always assumed they were in prison because twelve strangers said, ""Guilty."" The movie, The Visit, took me not only inside of prison walls, it took me inside of the prisoner's heart...a heart most people on the outside never know, not even a father. It took me inside the prisoner's thoughts as he looked at me through my television screen. I felt guilty for my own freedom. I saw in his eyes what I have felt many times, the sadness of a person who deserved more, a person who was not heard, a person who so much begs for freedom but can only look through cold steel bars. This movie gave me a sense of what my freedom really means. Freedom is a choice every day of your life. You don't have to go to prison to be in prison. I cried the tears this man could not part with. This movie is a lesson in life."
1,COMPLETE GARBAGE - DO NOT BUY,"Approximately a week after purchasing this it began to malfunction. The unit flashes ""Loading"" for a couple of minutes and then turns off. Like the users stated this problem has gotten progressively worse. It occurs when you turn it on, turn it off (after playing for a couple of minutes), with a disc in, without a disc in, it just doesn't work.If thats not enough, it has the absolute worse users manual I have ever seen. JVC should not only refund my money they should pay me for my aggravation."
4,One of his best,An excellent book with appealing characters that change over time. A good fast paced plot.
5,should have been rated 30!!,This was the first book I've read of Raymond E. Feist and its the best book I've read. All his other books are excellent as well but this one just has a great feel to it. Order this book and request a few days off work. Its so addictive you won't be able to put it down.
3,Average - doesn't stand up well for multiple reads,"This was really the first fantasy book I ever read. I read it in junior high and couldn't put it down. However, I've recently re-read it, and compared with the Dragonlance and Salvatore's FR stuff, unfortunately it just doesn't hold up.For one thing, the story is light and wasn't entirely gripping. THe characters are okay, but not spectacular. I enjoyed Feist's writing style, descriptive but not too wordy. I think overall the story could have used more action.I haven't read the subsequent riftwar books, and I'm not sure if I'm going to."
5,"A Wonderful Fantasy, the best I've read in a long time.","To the forest on the shore of the Kingdom of the Isles, the orphan called Pug came to study with the Mater Magician Kulgan. But though his courage won him a place at Court and the heart of the lovely Princess, he was ill at ease with the normal ways of wizardry.Yet Pug's strange sort of magic would one day change forever the fates of two worlds. For dark beings from another world had opened a rift in the fabric of spacetime to begin the age-old battle between the forces of the Order and Chaos.Very well written. Exciting."
3,average,"Although some of Feist's later work is more interesting and original, Apprentice is strictly traditional. The charectors are nothing new, and are very one-dimensional-there isnt a genuinely bad person in the whole story! Also, Feist doesn't write warfare very well. He is better suited to adventues, political intrigue, and showing what life is like for his charectors. His world is well imagined though, and seems real. It can be an entertaining read, but it brings nothing new."
2,Reads like CliffsNotes (does not live up to the hype),"Sure, the current rule of fantasy writing seems to be that books must be 800+ pages and be part of a 3 - 10 novel series. That can be great, but it can also be tedious so I'm always on the look out for shorter novels that are well ranked by Amazon. There are a few out there that I've been impressed by and I was hoping that Magician Apprentice and Master would be the same. Unfortunately, they weren't. Both novels feel rushed and lacking in the detail that makes other fantasy worlds feel real. As a result, the characters ring hollow and while there are interesting ideas, execution is poor. If you want something better read the original Shannara trilogy, the first 4 Malazan novels, the first 3 or so Wheel of Time novels, the first Recluce novel, Friedman, Farlan, Harris. You get the idea. Just don't burn your time here."
1,This Book has NO plot,"The whole thing had the originality of a second-rate chick flick. Their is no antagonist and not clear protagonist. The system of magic is never really explained so it leaves the reader whith a feeling of confusion. The plot is more of a random series of events that have no climax. The magical armor was a good idea but we never got to really see what lasting effect it had on Tomas. The ""enemies"" are from another world. Enough said. The main character, ""Pug"" was absolutely non-essential until the last bit where he was more convienient than nescessary (they probably could have negotiated the portal closed). The time flows about as smoothly as sand paper and the Magician owns a pet dragon(a little one). Do not waste your time with these books."
1,"Raymond E. Feists book ""Magician: Apprentice""",I ordered the book on the 7th of November with the estimated delivery date of the 15th of November to the 1st of December. As of the 11th of December I had not yet recieved the book. I emailed the vendor to find out where my book was and failed to get a reply so I filed a claim with Amazon to get my money back for the purchase.
3,Good Spin Doctors music but not great Spin Doctor music,"Ive been a fan of Spin Doctors since I was 13. Turn It Upside Down was the first album I bought and remains my favorite Spins album to this day. Here Comes the Bride is a decent album, its just not a great album which I have come to expect from Spin Doctors. The Best songs are Diamond, The Bigger I laugh, Wow, and Tomorrow can pay the rent. Some of the stuff though is just hard to listen to like Waiting for the Blow. The original lineup is back together now so hopefully they will churn out more stuff in the vein of Turn It Upside Down and Youve got to Believe In Something. This album has about four really good songs on it, music that you should hear, but the others are just decent at best. Overall its a keeper because of Chris Barron's soulful, optimistic singing."
2,It's just okay,"While I was hoping for more control and a smoother line under my clothes, the Flexees Instant Slimmer didn't live up to its name. It is scratchy (even after washing)and not as comfortable as I had hoped. My search continues!!!"
5,Romantic hip-hop smooth jazz style mood music,"The Spanish roots of this music truly evoke all the innuendo and passion that romance creates between two people - if actions speak louder than words, this music certainly paints an emotional picture that serves as a backdrop for a hot romantic connection - Jon's music provides that and more - lending an atmosphere of intertwining major/minor melodies and chords - much like the variety of emotions between two lovers - Jon is a friend of mine and I play most of the guitar parts on this album - having said that you might think this is biased - but from an artist's point of view - I found myself surrendering to the ""portrait"" of his compositions, lending only my own suggestions to what was already a complete description of passion in the night -"
2,O'hara's Wife,Product arrived weeks sooner than expected. It is a wonderful movie but the picture quality is not as good as the DVD's I have bought from other suppliers.
3,A hard rocking collaboration from many musical greats!!!,"This is a great cd to throw in and just rock out to. It has a hard edge to every song, with a bit of humor. The best song on the album by far is ""Jerk""! This was the only one that got air play, albeit late at night air play. If you love to rock, buy this cd. No dissapointment here."
4,Great ole' Western actioner,"It's good to ""Johnny Reno"" on DVD. This film, made in the mid-1960s, when the traditional Western genre was undergoing radical (and in some cases, not too favorable) change, ""Johnny Reno"" is an entertaining--at times a bit nostalgic---throwback to an earlier time when Westerns dominated at box offices and every kid wanted to grow up like Randy Scott and Wild Bill Elliott. Look for numerous familiar faces---A. C. Lyles and R.G. Springsteen peopled this film, and the other 11 or 12 made by them during the same period, with familiar Western faces and characters. It's all very enjoyable, and well worth the small investment. Go for it, and sit back and enjoy."
5,Good as it comes,"It is your standard Wii nunchuck. Nothing mroe to say about it really, I am really happy with it and has not proven troublesome yet."
4,"Nifty, but feels unfinished","The nunchuk controller is a unique way to play games. It's disconcerting at first to have your hands apart, rather than hanging onto a controller and operating two thumbsticks. But then it rocks, especially in games like Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. The accelerometers inside the nunchuk make it more than just a one-handed thumbstick. You can toss it forward and yank it back to pull objects in the game. Super-freaking cool.My only complaint about the nunchuk is that it feels unfinished, sort of plain. It's just a smooth hunk of molded plastic. There's not even a Wii logo. It seems almost like a prototype. It sounds stupid, perhaps, but it needs a bit more flair. Maybe a ""grippy"" surface or something.But... it does what it's supposed to do and does it well."
3,"Ebony, not much different than Ivory","I mainly purchased this product for two reasons:1) One of the Nunchuks that came with a pre-owned Wii performed poorly due to the fact that the connection wire was stretched enough to be dislodged from the connector plug and I needed a replacement.2) It's a change from the normal white color.So far I have utilized the controller add-on only thrice: The first time I used the item straight out of the box, a second time some time after I used the Wii-fit for what I assume is aerobic boxing and a third time today while playing Wii-Sports boxing with my older sister. Not once have I noticed that it performed any differently than a white Nunchuk, as it should be. Granted, there are some response issues but that is to be expected of the product design as a whole and it would take one to get used to its quirks, but it is adequate enough for everyday play. It may be strange to have a black Nunchuk connected to a white Wii-mote, but control-wise there is no difference."
2,Better with OEM....,Bought this non OEM Wii nunchuck... used it for two months then quit working!! Price is cheap but that's what you got... Better with OEM next time...
1,Doesn't work,I bought 2 of this for my little siblings and they didn't work...after I connect both of the nunchuk's they were never recognize by the wii
1,"Imitation part, not made by Nintendo","The product came in what looks like a genuine Nintendo product's box, but the item itself is definitely not legitimate. It feels cheap; the stick is off-center and does not have smooth action; the screws are not the tamper-proof style that Nintendo uses; most damningly, the Nintendo logo is not present anywhere on the item itself."
5,Wii Nunchuk for boxing!,"Another device needed to fully enjoy the Wii system. You can't box without this controller. They should include this with the package, but that is a different story.A must have for this game system."
4,Satisfied and happy to be gaming,"The product arrived on time, worked well and is working well. My kids love it. Thank you"
1,Knock-off not worth it,"Sometimes the generic version of a product works just fine. This is not one of those cases.After having this controller for only a few weeks, it rapidly became loose in its movement and spring, to the point that it began to misfire or get stuck in one direction, making delicate character movement nearly impossible. While the reseller was very responsive--when I complained he sent me two more for free--it didn't help that the replacement units also suffered the same fate. Within a month or so, they too lost responsiveness and became worthless.Keep in mind that these were used by a 4-year-old and 7-year-old, playing maybe 3 hours a week, not exactly power gamers. And while you may excuse the problems with the nunchuk due to their youthful exuberance, we used these alongside a ""real"" Nintendo nunchuk that had already been in use for the previous 6 months or so. It kept on going strong while the knock-off controllers failed miserably."
4,wii Nunchuk controller,Purchased this as a christmas gift for my son he wanted an extra one for when his friends came over to play. Tried it out when arrived worked fine. The item arrived at a reasonable amount of time.
1,Did Not Work,"We opened this package with anticipation, since we've just bought out first Wii. Unfortunately, the nunchuk doesn't work--it shimmers our characters in place, runs them in circles and just generally won't respond.We don't plan to buy anything like this from Amazon again."
4,Fun necessity for Wii Games,"This is an essential accessory for those who want to take full advantage of the Wii gaming system. Boxing is fun with someone you love, but it also serves as a good aerobic workout for you using this device. Other reviews have done a very good job explaining the tricks for using this, so I will just comment that you need to get at least 2 of these (buy an extra) if you get the system. Four if you are getting a full sytem."
2,seemed OK,"I bought this to enable 2 people to play the boxing game. Unfortunately one controler is a bit better than the other (more responsive), so there is always an argument as to who gets the ""good one""."
5,serves its purpose,i needed another nunchuk for my wii so i could play with friends. it works just as it is supposed to.
1,Does not work properly,No control with nunchuck. Should have bought a new one. Lessons learned. 0 stars is how it should be rated
1,Be prepared to buy replacements,"This is a review of the quality of the product, not it's ingenuity or usefulness to gameplay.Through 20+ years of experience I have found that OEM game controllers are the best way to go. I am not abusive to my equipment.That being said, I have now gone through 5 genuine Nunchuks in less than a year.1 had the Z button not work right out of the box. It was returned to Amazon for replacement. The replacement controller Z button failed after about 4 hours of gameplay.1 had an extremely stiff stick I hoped would loosen over time. It did not, eventually sticking in the down position.2 have had sticks that break loose and eventually become non-responsive.I have purchased the y-wing screwdriver to disassembe Wii controllers in hopes to repair any of these to no avail. They do not have serviceable parts that can be easily swapped out.I'm gonna bite the bullet and try an aftermarket unit for my next purchase."
5,Works well,I needed it for my wii so I bought it. I can't say I use it often but when I do it works well.
3,Wii game system pack,"As far as the product itself, it's fine. As for its promised delivery date and condition it arrived, not so great. It arrived week and half after the date promised and in an unsealed package not to mention a bit beat up because the box itself bearely fit the nunchuk, thank goodness for factory packaging. Rather disappointing."
5,Does what it is supose to do,Obviously for the nintendo wii system. The basic one that comes with the wii system. We bought this one so we could play two player games.
1,Don't purchase this!,"I don't know how this happened or what, but this Nunchuk feels fake to me. The action of the joystick is rough, the plastic that it is made of has a rougher texture and seems to be cheaper. The cord length is about 3 inches shorter than the store bought legit Nunchuks. I don't know where this one came from. It affects gameplay a lot and I would strongly recommend going to the store and buying the real thing rather than this fake."
1,Seem to be not an original product,"I bought three of them and they were sent without the original box, and they look like if they were used. The sticker with the instruction in one of them looks like if it were re-attached to it. And the quality of that stickers and the connectors are not as the originals."
3,It broke after a few weeks,"I bought this a while ago and used it a handful of times... maybe about 5 times. Today, this nunchuk become completely unresponsive or would do the opposite of the command. A waste of money. It did not arrive in a box as pictured. It arrived in a plastic bag and had a yellowish tint to it in comparison with the other one that we had that came with the wii system. I wouldn't recommend it, mine worked only for a few weeks of rare usage.Update: I contacted the seller and they sent me a new one. This might break as well but we'll see if I have better luck this time around. At least the seller tried to help having in mind my purchase is more than a month old."
2,fast,I orders the product and it came quickly and but not functioning as it should. It is nogt a very good product.
5,THANK GOD FOR CHEAP TRICK,"I was at the last of the METRO shows in Chicago, and the energy and fun are perfectly captured here. I would have loved a double album...This band has done some fine studio work, but their live shows have a unique appeal in their own right. Cheap Trick has a singular sense of humor onstage and their fun is contagious. They make rock and roll look easy, maybe too easy, with a mixture of great songs and great musicianship. After 25 years of rocking, I have no idea where they get their energy, but you can feel it when you play this album."
4,Good Job,"This is very cute, very colorful item.Have not yet washed it- will let you know how it holds up!"
1,Don't bother...,"This guy is a hack.In spite of what you might hear to the contrary, you are better off to simply obtain a copy of the Chicago Reader - a free newspaper and this guy's primary vehicle - or see it on the web: chireader. Simply find any of his reviews and read backwards and you will quickly spot patterns. He generally uses history as a crutch and typically attacks directors and actors directly rather than addressing the actual films - ESPECIALLY when the films might be more politically oriented.His examples are generally trite and frankly you'd be better finding out about this guy's politics before you bother reading anything he writes claiming to be ""political"". I feel sorry for any film students out there that have this as course material and more so for anyone who was self-motivated to seek this out."
2,More about the nobles than the actual armies.,"Although this volume purports to cover the armies of these two key battles, only two of the colour plates feature actual soldiers. The rest depict various nobles and lords, including Edward III and Jean II, even though their armor is not at all indicative of what the rest of the armies were wearing. Worse still, these nobles are shown in fancy types of armor, like crested helms, that even the text admits they would not have been wearing on the battlefield. The text does include some interesting details on command and control and supply logistics, but as a reference on the actual field armies it is thin."
1,Skip Lily Quench,"While aimed at the ""tween"" 9-12 year girl set, there are sufficiently disturbing elements and sprawling unoriginality in the Lily Quench series to recommend a pass.1) The main antagonist is a scheming torturess. No descriptions of torture are made, but the threat is constant. This caused real conflict in our family, as I was put on the spot trying not to explain to an 9-year old what an Iron Maiden is.2) The males are either retiring, passive nerds, or raging-male figures -- hardly a wholesome palette from which to form positive opinions of boys and men.3) Bald-faced ripoffs from the Harry Potter series and Lord of the Rings crop up quite often. ""Derivative"" is putting it mildly.I imagine the author fancies herself Roald Dahl's literary heir. Whereas Dahl's works are often entertaining-subversive, Ms. Prior's stuff is merely tiresome-perverse."
3,Cold Kill,",I was kind of disapointed, since the writing was repetative, I had expected a lot more from Jack Olsen, sincehe usually is much more engrossing."
1,The best bad diving movie ever,"Ok, this movie sucks, bad! However, if you are a commercial deep sea diver, or know one you should at least see it once. There is a lot of liberty taken with the way it really is, the laws of physics, and, well, its a movie. That being said, it is the closest thing to the real world of commercial diving in the gulf of mexico that I have seen. If you want accurate gas laws watch men of honor, if you want to see what the living conditions are like for your brother, uncle, or son watch this. It should be required viewing for anyone prepairing to go to dive school."
5,Perfect Camera for the Non professional,I was a little worried when I read some of the reviews regarding this camera. After using it extensively for the past two weeks I can only assume they must have been comparing it to a Canon 5D. The pictures are excellent. I have compared the pictures to my Canon 30D and I was very impressed. Obviously Canon never designed this camera to be a replacement to a SLR camera with a lens that cost 3 times the price of the A710IS. The 6X optical zoom is great and the image stabilization is a must have on the long zooms. Ninety percent of the people using cameras today would be very happy with this camera the rest need to purchase a high end SLR
1,black screen failure,"I ordered one in December 06 it arrived with a black viewfinder. You could see various information, but any picture taken was just a solid black rectangle. Amazon exchanged it in time for Christmas 06! The replacment camera lasted till February before it too failed to this mysterious black screen malfunction. Canon will repair them for free, you just have to mail it to them and wait. While it worked it made nice pictures. Most of the time however, it did not take pictures. It just made black rectangles. Incredibly I recommended it to a friend. After a few weeks, theirs also stopped taking pictures and only made black rectangles. I think I have to face the reality that all the ones I've had experience with are worse than junk."
5,Great camera. Up to Canon's great standards,"Have had, and still have, multiple Canon and Sony cameras for various purposes. This particular Canon has great specs and even more importantly, my wife loves using it more than any others that she's used before."
4,Great little camera,"Camera was a gift for my wife. She enjoys flower/garden photos and macro photography. So far she is very pleased with it.With flash I noticed that there is a 3-4 second delay between pictures which seems annoying.IF making the decision over, I would still buy this camera."
5,Nice touch!,"What I like: AA batteries that last for several hundred shots; ease of downloading files; 6x zoom; stitch mode; lots of useful modes; compact size; just about all the features I could want; great looking pictures!What I would improve: Image stabilization in low-light situations, and better quality low-light shotsOverall, I was so pleased, I bought another one for my wife, and one for my daughter!"
4,cannon a710is camara and amazon customer service,Thought we had some trouble with the first camera... A slight whirring noise when the led was lit. Cannon said to return camera to Amazon. Amazon's customer service bent over backwards to send us a new camera by Xmas. They really went over and beyond great service. The new camera made the same noise. Called Canon again and this time service rep. went to some quiet corner and got the same whirring noise. Come to find out the noise was to be expected in this model. Camera does everything we hoped it would and more.
5,As good as Sknyrd's One More From The Road!!,"This is the best live CD from the 1980's--period. Molly Hatchet's popularity may have been waning by the mid 80's, but they were certainly going down fighting, judging from the intense performances on this CD--amazing! One great song and performance after another. The Freebird cover was awesome--Danny Joe Brown sang it perfectly! Ronnie would be proud (he was planning on producing Molly Hatchet before the Skynyrd plane crash occurred)! The guitarists are on fire throughout! Boogie No More is incredible!The sound quality (EQ'ing, specifically) is great on some songs, OK on others, and lousy on one or two. Apparently it's tough to capture a live CD from analog tapes soundwise, because Skynyrd's One More From The Road was spotty with the EQing as well. But the quality of the performances completely cancels out the weaknesses in the sound, as far as I'm concerned.This CD is a MUST HAVE for any guitar-rock enthusiast, and especially for any Southern Rock fan!"
5,PERFUME SOFISTICADO,"EL PERFUME LLEGO EN PERFECTO ESTADO, TENIA UNA BOTELLA ANTERIORMENTE Y LA FRAGANCIA ES LA MISMA, ES APROPIADO PARA ALGUIEN JOVEN Y QUE DESEA ALGO FRESCO, FLORAL Y MODERNO"
1,Cluncky and Junkey,I bought it and hated it. It was large and hard to open. I sent it back and took the phone back a few days later.
3,Ok!,"This case is ok...i actually had my phone drop out of the case, by itself! my phone got damaged and this case was suppose to protect it...but when it did protect my phone it was a charm!"
4,It fine,"Is not bad ,Just a little smaller of my exception ,But My bags has home now !!!It won't mess anymore.By the way Is made in china .What can I said ? If you wanna cheaper one and can help you some ,That it !"
4,"Too long, but helpful!",I cannot imagine how I lived without it! All my favorite purces and bags are in separate pockets now! I'll buy it for my sister too!
1,Call this one Hurricane Awful,"I just sat through this truly AWFUL remake of the 1937 classicwith Jon Hall and Dorothy Lamour, and it stank so bad, the film-makers had to resort to splicing in footage and sound from theoriginal!!! Positively one of the worst remakes that I have ever tried to sit through-do yourself a HUGE favor, and buy theoriginal 1937 film, it is far,far,better-and the special effectsare still terrifying, and still excellent.This movie features a positively wooden performance by one of the most overrated bad actresses of our time, Mia Farrow. Areal stinkeroo, this film! Don't waste your time or money withthis pile of tax write-off!It reekas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Funny but Cartman being a idiot,I thought this was funny but i thouht it was not nice and probably offended the jews and i bet kyle got carried away with himself and that it was not our fault and we did not kill Jesus all right Mel Gibson i still like the guy but he just can be a fag.
3,Voice needs to be more focused than background sounds,"Songs themselves are great as well as her amazing voice though, I was disappointed about those loud background sounds.It's Jessica's voice that should be focused."
4,A Wonderful Read!!!!,I loved this book and couldn't put it down. The characters and their struggle to uphold their beliefs while fighting their love was a heart-tugger. I can't wait to read the next in the series. And I look forward to many more books from these authors.
1,The toys we had as kids,"The toys we had as kids were made in the USA...nothing is anymore...low prices, lower quality. If you want better quality...you have to pay more. But darn all the factories are closed."
1,Terrible,"I keep waiting for this grab me, but it's just horrible. Supposedly Joe Strummer told Mick Jones himself before he died. Save your money."
2,Dirty,Opened the box and there was no wrapping on it or any kind of box that went with it. Item seemed used. I was very unhappy
3,"very cute, but...","I love the way this shoe looks, a bit primitive. But, the cut of it pinches the top of my foot around the opening, and I have to wear fairly thick socks or the back of the shoe rubs my heel too hard. I'm hoping that they will wear in a bit, though. I haven't worn them very much."
4,A good message on reality!,"While the acting may be bad, they made sure the core message about the streets got out in this one. What you do in your youth and as a young adult can easily come back to haunt you - even if you left the gang life behind, enemies don't forget your face! ""Smile now, Cry later"""
1,Torn apart bracelet when received,"I was very DISAPPOINTED with the purchase from Secure Hoop. I just received it today (7-18-2005), when I open the package, the bracelet was already torn apart into loose pieces of pink rocks!!!!I've called their customer service number 888-651-2828, but no one pick up the phone, and there WASN'T any VOICEMAIL for me to leave back!!! What kind of company is that? At least there should be a voicemail that said what time they will open to business and stuff. Anyway, I don't recommend anyone to buy stuff from Secure Hoop!!!"
5,Our dogs loved these!,"Our two pugs loved the Quados that Santa left for them under the tree! The Quado kept them busy and gave them an outlet for their chewing needs. Not much mess was left over, either. I will definitely buy these again."
1,"Finished in 1 hour, thrown up in 3","Thought this was a nylabone, didnt realize it was a 'treat' until my Pup had consumed an entire leg within the first hour !!Was cleaning up puke the rest of the night...very unhappy with this product... packaging should really say 'treat / not chew toy' and warn owners of potential for cleaning up (did I mention ALL NIGHT?) afterwards.a) not worth the $$b) not worth the pain in the a$$c) just go get your dog a kong already"
2,Very disappointed,"This is sold as a ""bone"" so I expected it to be something solid that he could chew on for a while. This is really more of a treat. We had to take it from him after 5 minutes because it was almost gone. He finished it another day in another 5 minute session with it. This will not last if your dog is a big chewer. I feel like it was a big waste of money."
5,LOVE IT!!!!!!!,Very solid and durrable unit.Speed of the flashing can be adjustend with the turn of a knob. Unit can also be set to react to sound.Would recommend this to anyone who likes to throw dance parties.This is a 'Must Have' for anyone who is just getting started in the Dj.
1,Never again!,Musician's friend is not my friend. When they first shipped my lights they arrived in pieces and one item was missing. They did replace the broken light's but never replaced the one they did not send. Needed to call and call to have it removed from my bill. I am one unhappy camper and they need to get their act together.
3,Tap Dance music,"I heard one of the songs on the album in my car on Sirius/XM radio and I had no idea it was an old song by Bill Withers. The song is Use Me and I ""use"" it for my tap class. It is perfect for the warm ups that I do. I like some of the other songs on the album as well. Who knew?!"
4,As good as a non-fansub can be.,"First, the good. The tie ins to gameplay from Final Fantasy VII are a little more distinct in this version. Some choices of music are more appropriate for some scenes, and the way the combat played out in certain scenes fits the story better. The box says 26 more minutes of footage. It feels like 45 minutes extra. All very good things.Bad: I'm extremely picky regarding my Japanese to English subtitle translations. Generally, the ones sold in the 'states are okay. That is to say, a lot of the cultural referencing in the language gets roughly translated into something close to American verbage. The result? The dilly-dally shilly-shally scene. If this sort of thing gets on your nerves, go find a fansub. If you don't know what that means, don't worry about it. Get this movie, it's terrific."
1,Disappointed,"Not too happy about disc audio. The audio is really bad, it keeps going low and high then low then high again. Disappointed! I tried it on both my Mac and my PC same issue. Image is fine but not worth the money because the audio ruins it."
3,Not THAT great,"I live in Japan so bought this the day it was released.Watching it on my High-Def 37"" TV, I can say it does look and sound very nice, but to be honest, not THAT much better than the DVD release which I watched on the same TV. It in all honesty looks roughly the same.But I didn't buy it for the movie which is so-so (I love the game).The FFXIII demo is real the reason to get this bundle. The game is simply gorgeous, fluid, minimal loading times, and has an evident epic storyline. Honestly it is like playing a CG version of say, FFX on the PS2. The demo takes roughly an hour to play too, and gives you a good idea of something much bigger to come.The movie is well, alright quality wise. I guess if I had not seen it on DVD I would have been more 'blown away' by it."
3,English menus would be nice...,"english menus would have been a welcome feature of this DVD.Other than that the CGI is beautiful, the story is excellent but IF you're not familiar with the FF7 story you're going to feel left in the dark.Action scenes were nice but extremely fast paced (maybe a little too fast paced) & I know it's fantasy but I just don't dig the whole ""magically suspended in the air as long as I'm swinging a sword"" aspect."
5,Kicks ass,"I didn't know anything about the Final Fantasy series when I saw this film. So, I didn't fully understand the story. But, the animation in this is unbelieveably awesome. Just the beauty of the animation is worth seeing. The action sequences are superb. Amazing piece of work. If you're an animation fan or fan of manga and art, this is a definite must."
5,"If you loved FF7, you probably own this. If you are remotely into Final Fantasy, this is a huge improvement","Ill start off by saying, those who love FF7 probably own this and the original.For those who are into Final Fantasy, this is for you. You may have seen the spirits within and was slightly confused. This is nothing like that and actually hits closer to the more popular Final Fantasys.This is a perfect addition for a Blu-ray collection. The entire movie, for those who have remember the first, has been basically redone. Granted the bulk of the movie is the same as the original, it has much added to it. This is more like a 2.0 version rather than a 1.5. I suggest everyone pick this up"
3,Just average,"This movie does not do justice to the game. The story was completely one-dimentional and plain. People who have not played the game would have trouble understanding what is going on. The only thing good about this movie is the visual effects. Oh, and everyone had virtually indestructuble bodies and defied the laws of physics throughout the entire movie."
3,ff7,cool movie and nice to have dont really have much else to say but you know you should really pick it up
3,Good!...but not that great,"This attempt of a new Final Fantasy movie is very good..but odd thats for sure. However, i like this movie than i did the older one, however, the only fault with this movie is that the story line is confusing and some what boring at times. The only good parts is the graphics which are truly amazing in my view...however, this is only a rental movie."
5,Final fantacy,Awsome condition came very fast and I love this movie so om 100 percent saticfied with my purchase! Keep up the great work.
1,Horrible,"This was the worst thing I've ever bought. What I got wasn't even close to what you showed it was. This was just a double pack feature. Nothing like the pictures, packaging, cards of the characters. It was truly disappointing and made me really angry"
5,FFVII: Advent Children Blu-Ray,"This is a must have for all Final Fantasy fanatics such as myself! The action is amazing, especially when Cloud faces off against Kadaj/Sephiroth and the music during that sequence is absolutely riveting! Would recommend this a million times over!"
3,Nostalgic feelings at a rather hefty price.,"I love the final fantasy series. ESPECIALLY final fantasy 7. it was a game that truly changed my life. I didn't see the movie when it first came out because I was very bitter that it wasn't a PS3 remake of 7. But I bought it a while ago and had a chance to watch it. The story is very simple to understand if you're a fan of the game. It begins about 2-3 years after the events of the first game (i think, I can't remember the time for sure).Its filled with brilliant CGI action with traditional anime themes. I enjoyed it, but I realized that it just made me miss playing 7. So I fired up my PSX and played 7 for a few weeks until my fix was fixed.If you loved FF7 and care about the characters you will like this film. Casual fans of action movies might not appreciate this as much as the die hard constituency of FF fans.Worth a view, but not a buy. Rent it."
2,"All style, very little substance","Amazing visual experience, and I don't even have an HDTV. The details are immaculate and gorgeous, and the fight scenes are insane... but that's about it. Unless you are a die hard fan of the series, this movie will completely fail to carry itself in terms of story and character development. Dialogue is bland, and it is very unlikely that you'll care about what's going on and why. Disappointed :("
1,Had no idea what was going on,"I played through 1/2 of the game a few years ago (it crashed half way through). The DVD comes with a recap of sorts for those who want to refamiliarize themselves with the original plot, or for those who didn't play the game. After that, you are thrown into a flimsy (if not absent) plot with no character developement (the hallmark of Final Fantasy games). The musical Score was amazing, and I highly recommend the CD, but as for the movie, I watched it, and have no idea what happened."
1,very disappointing...,"as a massive ff7 fan i really looked forward to this one. don't repeat my mistake. the graphics are gorgeous, but the utter lack of anything resembling a plot kills this 'film'. honestly the whole movie is just like a preview teaser clip of fighting you would see running in a video game store, except it lasts 1:40. it was much more enjoyable watching the ff7 scenes ('reminiscence') than the movie itself. don't waste your time on this pretty superficial nothing."
1,NOT Recommended,"If you want a beautifully animated movie with no sensical plot whatsoever, then this is for you. Don't get me wrong: I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan, and have been awaiting this with bated breath. However, it was a sorry disappointment. The plot was awful. I don't want to go into detail for fear of ruining it for those who haven't seen it, but they rarely discussed the plot with any detail and barely brushed the surface of it, which caused a lot of confusion for me and the others who watched it with me. By the end of the movie, I still didn't quite understand what had happened.All in all, I don't think it was very well thought out. It just seemed like an excuse for cheesy battle scenes and to grab a bit of cash from Final Fantasy VII fans. If you're still interested, I suggest renting it first, because I feel like I totally wasted my money."
1,"NICE TO LOOK AT, BUT THATS IT!!!!!!!!","No doubt this is one beautiful movie to look at, that's where it ends. Fight scenes are so fast and all over the place you cant even keep up, it's flashing pictures going so fast it gives you a headache!!!!! And the plot, let's not even go there, because unless your some Final Fantasy Zombie Fanatic you dont know whats going on, you feel like you walked in the middle of a story and your job is to figure it out. Sorry but unless your part of the Final Fantasy Zombie Fanatic FAN BASE you might wan't to stay clear of this one."
1,Did anyone understand any of it?,"Sure it was visually stunning and more movies should be made like this, but the story went pretty much nowhere. I am not a fan of the FF franchise, but one of my best friends is and loved FF7 the game, and even he agrees that this movie made absolutely no F'ing sense."
4,"Realistic animation, good story","At 68, and not a fan of this type of animation, it sold me to the point that I bought the whole collection."
4,FF lovers must see it,"This is a movie targeted at FF7 lovers. You will see your favorite heroes come back from retirement and battle an old evil.The storytelling is not particularly elaborated, and casual fans might get completely lost on the plot. It, however, has some 5 minute, fast-track, mind-refresher video of the important events in the original FF7 game."
1,Where is this suppossed movie?,This is total(place imaginative word here)! Where is the movie? I ordered it before it was to come out in 2006 and now it says 2010! Thats NOT what I ordered. Who orders a movie 4 YEARS BEFORE ITS PUT OUT!? No one! Thats why it is incredibly stupid that they pushed it back! I urge others who ordered it to write and ask whats going on. Dont order this movie from Amazon because you could probly find it out EARLIER somewhere else!
2,Wow. What a waste of time.,"Seriously, The Spirits Within was a better film than this circle-jerk fanservice fluff. One-dimensional characters, a paper-thin plot, and action sequences that could cause even the most lacadasical person to go into epileptic fits.Your money is *much* better spent on the awesome soundtrack by series composer Nobuo Uematsu and his band The Black Mages."
5,I forgot it was in Japanese,"The movie was crystal clear, I've watched movie many times, but watching this Blu-ray edition, I saw things I've never spotted, it was like Easter egg hunting. I've been watching this movie in English all the time, I forgot that I can watch this in Japanese. Turned off subtitles, relaxed and watched in Japanese, it was excellent."
5,Better than a two-piece and a BISCUIT!,"I've had a problem with movies I had high hopes for turning out to be the worst movies I've ever seen. But, this movie turned my world completely upside-down. I had tremendous hopes for FF7:AC and this time I was rewarded with an awesome movie with an awesome story and awesome graphics... not to mention awesome fight scenes!I am definitely going to fork over the cash when the DVD releases! Buy this movie, you'll thank yourself!"
3,Beautiful Movie but the story suffered,"This is a beautifully-done movie, with interesting connections with (and continuations of) characters from Final Fantasy VII. And the story of this DVD is definitely interesting, with pretty good acting generally. But you'll also find extended fight scenes that at least for me were not particularly interesting (even though I recognized some of the moves/abilities/summons from playing the game as a kid). So I admit I'm surprised this has nearly a 5 star rating - it just wasn't that good to me.In summary, if you're an FF fan, you will probably enjoy renting the movie. But personally, I didn't like it enough to own it."
2,Meh...,"I was really excited about this as I grew up playing FF7 on the original PlayStation when it came out. Unfortunately like a lot of Anime this suffers from a complete separation from the game besides character names. The art was ok but I expected better, and the story is disjointed and doesn't make a lot of sense, and the characters are rather undefined. I've spent my life playing FF games so I expect the disjointedness between FF games but this was billed as FF VII so I expected it to tie in a lot better instead I felt completely let down by this."
5,"I LOVED THE MOVIE, JAMES COBURN IS A GREAT ACTOR AND CARROL O'CONNOR IS FUNNY TO LOOK AT DURING THE SCENES WITH COBURN !","I LOVE SEEING THIS MOVIE CLASSIC, ESPECIALLY DURING THE SCENES BETWEEN O'ONNOR AND COBURN PLUS THE SONGS "" THE BALLAD OF THE CODE OF THE WEST "" A VERY FUNNY SONG. THEY SHOULD MAKE MORE MOVIES LIKE THIS, I REMEMBER WHEN CLASSIC COWBOY MOVIES WAS FUN TO WATCH !!!! :)"
3,Useful for its type,"If you're a serious student of costume history, this book is not for you. But if you're a beginning re-enactor, or you work with them, it's an excellent source for getting the ""feel"" of a period. It is typically Victorian in line, as are many similar books still in print. BUT it's comprehensive through many time periods, shows accessories well (which a lot of similar books do not), and makes for a good beginning point.I've found it very useful in getting beginning costume students to pick a period for further research."
1,"Good for collages, not for research","This book is a picture-book of nineteenth century visions of historic costumes, possibly aimed at nineteenth century people interested in costume parties or plays.Do not be fooled by the detailed nineteenth century engraving work or the look of these images. They are not old. They are not accurate. They are perniciously, convincingly realistic-looking, thanks to Victorian obsessiveness about fussy little ersatz details. They are not to be relied upon.Thanks to that very fussy nineteenth century engraving style, they are very useful for collage art. They might also make a fun coloring book.But rely on them as history? Only if you are interested in the history of late nineteenth century German romantic fantasies about the past."
4,"Great price, makes nice ""pinky ring""","I bought it because I had been looking for rings in a size 4 that I could wear as pinky rings. This one fit the bill and was quite inexpensive. The garnet is kind of orangish rather than blood red like the picture shows -- that's why this ring gets four stars instead of five. But for the price, I am not complaining. And size 4 rings seem to be rare."
5,Nice flavor,"I bought these tea leaves to Use in my reusable kuerig KCup in the coffee maker. I am not an herbal tea lover, but wanted to try it for it's properties, as I have been having health problems the last few years. the flavor us a bit woodsey, but with lemon and honey added, I found the flavor to be pleasant enough."
5,Priceless Voice does it again !!!,"Sit back and get ready to absorb the sights sounds and smells of Christmas through the golden voice of Andy Williams, but with a new twist !!!! Andy new arrangements of classic holiday tunes is like opening up a gift on Christmas morning.You can tell he enjoyed recording these songs and almost see the twinkle in his eye.....A CHRISTMAS MUST!!!!"
2,love andy - but not this album,"i grew up listening to andy williams - so to me, christmas time is just not the same without his 'most wonderful time of the year' or 'bells of st mary's' playing in the background as i trim the tree or eat some of mom's turkey and dressing.but this album i didn't find that appealing. to me, it sounded too modern in its style, and while i love modern music in general, i can't take it at christmas time. some people like it, but i'm not one of them.i ended up selling the cd after one listen. if you like modern christmas tunes, this is for you. if you're like me, and you instead love bing crosby and traditional andy williams, then i suggest you steer clear of this one."
3,Not good for hearing devices.,"I purchased these for my father to use it in his in-ear hearing devices. After using two of the batteries for 6 days - average 8 hours/day, both hearing devices started giving low battery alert. So he replaced them with other batteries and they ended in just two days. Using all 10 batteries he easily concluded that the battery life is unpredictable. More expensive batteries end in 10 days in average. Not recommended for hearing device use."
1,I guess i get what i paid for :),"I tried out two sets of these batteries on two little Christmas blinker ornament thingy. Each of them requires two of these batteries and the batteries lasted only 4.3 hours. I got the ornament over 2 years ago and the batteries never got changed. Ofcourse, we only used the ornaments during Christmas, but Maxwell only lasted 4 hours.Update: I try another sets of batteries yesterday..after an hour of usage, i can see the brightness of the led reduced significantly. The led did continue to stay on for a few more hours before they are completely dead."
1,baterry rip off,"Ripoff,the $89 total I thought was for several items overnighted before Christmas, turns out it was for just the $2.00 pack of batteries. When I realized what was up I E-mailed 3 hours later and tried to cancel. They responded that order was already shipped. Turns out it was not and they were not overnighted but were sent UPS 2nd DAy Air. Filing Claim if the Vendor will not make this right."
1,Product is probably o.k.,Not sure about product since I waited three weeks to receive my shipment. Dealer told me twice he had shipped and then said he shipped it a second time. Guess it was lost in the mail....
5,Batteries for Christmas.,Got these batteries to replace ones used in a small Christmas pin. Now I can wear this pin for many more years.
4,Great Value for the price,"These batteries are not labeled for sale in the U.S.; however, it fits and works well."
4,Appear to be good batteries so far,Just tested the batteries for a short time and they seem to be very good.
3,Basically Ok,my batteries arrived promptly. They worked as hoped for. They just did not last as long as I would have liked. I was using 4 inside my laser pointer for my classes.
4,No problems!,These batteries were for a couple of laser pointers I have. They worked great. I was glad when I recieved them that I got the Maxell brand name as they were represented- I just trust the name brand stuff a little more. Great price too. I'll never buy these kinds of batteries at Walgrees or Batteries Plus or any other brick and mortar store agaain. The markup is insane. This pack of 10 costs the same as a back of ONE at Walgreens. Sweet.
5,Work like they should,"Batteries appear to work fine like they should. Can't speak to life of the batteries at this point, having just installed them, but they seem to be what I needed."
2,Confused and over-detailed,"Unfortunately I bought this book after reading the first three reviews. I think the later reviews are closer to the mark.The book is confusing and overly detailed with no unifying thread. I bought the standard, and reading it after this book was like a breath of fresh air."
1,I prefer rate it 0 star.,"This book won't make you understand anything about MPEG if you don't know anything about MPEG.If you already know something about MPEG, definatelly you don't have to read it.All graphs in this book are not related with context, and same to the math equations."
2,Interesting Movie,"Quality is not so great and the sound drops and flys off the chart a couple times, great film but not such a great dvd."
2,embarrassment,"this show is an embarrassment to people like me that come from Jersey, however I do know some people that fit right in with these idiots"
2,Proactive Blemish Treatment,"This product arrived as scheduled, but unfortunately, it did nothing to improve my daughter's blemishes. We were really disappointed. We will find something else that will work to clear up her skin."
3,A Ray Charles Christmas,Ray has chosen traditional Christmas songs and the arrangements are a delight to hear. I especially enjoy the slight muse photo of Ray driving the sled.That would be quite a sleigh ride!
1,7 months then nothing,"This mouse, that I bought on Amazon, suddenly stoppped working 7 months after purchase. I guess it might be better to buy a cheaper one than Verbatim, that I thought to be a serious and quality brand !!"
2,Cheap buttons make it difficult to use,"The retractable cable is very nice, and the small size also make for exactly the kind of portable mouse configuration I was looking for. However, the mouse buttons are so cheaply built that most of the time when you try to click the mouse you will just rub plastic against plastic with no mouse click being registered. It costs so little it's not worth the bother of returning; I guess some weekend I'll take it apart and see if I can improve matters."
2,Movie lovers-you can skip this book,"Before I purchased this book I read the two prior reviews and thought I'd give it a try. I found that if you enjoyed the movie on any level (cast, characters, actors, story-line), then forget purchasing this book. It has absolutely nothing to do with the movie in any way. They must have just liked the title and purchased the rights to it.I found the writing to be readable but not outstanding. The story unremarkable. None of the characters likeable or warm in any way with no real direction. If you want to read a modern day western, then Annie Proloux or Larry McMurtry or Tony Hillerman are far superior. This was a dissapointment."
2,Burns too fast,I have used other ear candles that burned much slower and got more wax out than these. They work but you have to use at least 2 per ear
3,"Decent product, but the scraper could be better.","This serves the purpose, but like all plastic scrapers, it doesn't do a great job on a light frost. I have bought these because they are great for brushing off snow and cracking through ice, but I have metal scrapers also that I keep for clearing off frost."
2,Not impressed,Blade was chewed up after one storm. Brush is nice but is useless without the blade. Look elsewhere if you count of this for everyday use.
4,Good,So far its been great. The brush and the scraper combo works wells to remove soft snow and hard ice from the windshield.
3,Funny Looking Robot,There is a funny looking android thing in this film that is so ineptly wrought that it is just fascinating to look at. Is it papeir mache or something else. Is that a cardboard box that the robots head is made of? Who could tell. Wonderfully cheap!
3,A little out of touch.,"This book is a good text for grad students and professors in political science. Others, however, will find this book sadly detached from reality. Those others (or who have a real life) will find other treatments of interest group lobbying far more useful. The model presented by the author is somewhat unclear and misdirected. The model does not capture the full range of motivations underlying grassroots lobbying."
4,PMD Review,"I thought that the characters provide insight into the fishing guide community for the Montana rivers. It is disappointing that the description of the clients ""sports"" depicts a bumbling group of idiots who have lots of money and very little fishing knowledge. There are very few fly fishing novels that provide fishing, sex, power struggles, and drama. I enjoyed the book and thought the book was very entertaining."
3,nice to have in collection,"This album was never 'stunning' to me. LL&CJ;'s debut got the best of their debut material in my opinion, as did UTFO. But, still this album is worth it for Unselfish Lover if nothing else. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad album at all; I guess I remember it being better.The sound is great, but a bit on the low end of the amplitude scale. FTG tends to remaster on the softer side, which is great for most of the 1970's reissue, but for album like this that was computer & traditional technologies, it can stand a better threshold for sound dynamics. nice to see it on CD."
2,Disappointing,"The graphics of this game are comparative to Zelda, so they're not too bad. The game would be fun and compel me to keep playing, if it weren't for the battles. You don't even get to have an open fight. You and your allies take turns throwing hits. You have a limited area you can travel once engaged in the ""battle"". You have so many hit points, and so much energy. You can also waste a precious hit to crack open a tree, hoping that there will be something of use inside (energy, etc). And if you dont get it before the battle is over, or get something thats dropped on the ground, you can kiss it goodbye. So if you like a very limited, controlled game, this may be a game of interest to you."
3,good but not keeping up with hack,this game is good but u should go with hack the bad thing about arc the lad is for one the battle system is very boaring and the game is hard to understand but waht it does have is good sounding rpg music and the graphics are pretty good but overall it gets 3 stars because at least they tried but i should say save ur money for the hack series much better game.
2,"Oddly dated yet ""new""","Just saw this film. From the shoestring production and film quality I assumed this was a vintage 1989 film. I was surprised to find it was actually made in 2000. Good try, but a standard ""B"" movie with some beach scenes. That it was Myrtle Beach and not Venice Beach is a big plus though."
4,"Overall, a great unit 'for the price'.","Has some quirks like going to a 'menu' if you aren't careful when adjusting the volume. Push button station controls are small and difficult without taking your eyes off the road; near impossible at night. The instructions in the manual for setting time aren't correct; maybe just my ignorance. Has good power for use with 'regular' speakers. Good FM reception but poor AM reception. Again, for the money you can't go wrong."
1,Truely Amazing!!!!,Just think how wealthy Warren Buffet would be today if he used Wades strategy. Give me a break! Don't buy this book. Buy a Coke instead.
1,Wade Loses Money in the Market!!,"Wade loses money in the stock market. He cannot do the strategies himself. Look at the finanical reports for the stock of the company he owns(ticker- WADE). He is also currently being sued by two states.(TX & CA) and under investigation in many others. The only way wade has made himself rich is by selling tapes, seminars,($2,000+) and books. Do your research on the man and his company before you take his advise. It will be worth your time."
1,Peice of Worthless Junk,If I could put zero stars here I would. About the only thing this book is good for is starting your fire in your fireplace. The only reason Wade Crook wrote this book was to promote one of his seminars. SAVE YOUR MONEY!
1,This must be a bad joke!,"This book reminds me of the first time I saw the rock band the Clash perform. It was on Saturday Night Live, and they were so awful that I mistakenly thought it was just another skit. Actually, they always stunk (IMHO), just like all of Wade Cook's books. There are many good books on trading options out there (I'm about to buy ""The Electronic Day Trader""). The only problem is you will need more than a 3ed-grade education to understand them. If you are in third grade, then maybe this book is for you. It's barely written in English, and the type is huge (probably to make it look long enough to be a real book). And most 3ed graders haven't saved enough allowance to open a brokerage account, so it'll be pretty harmless. At least until you grow up. 'Nuff said."
3,picking flowers out of a weed patch,"I found wade to be a true american go getter but, he tends to wander on about his days as a taxi driver at the sacrifice of good information. I feel the 241 pages of material could be boiled down to 100 pages of true material and still have room for his life story. Don't get me wrong i would like to thank him for the marvelous information which has changed my life but i feel that a person wanting to learn his methods would benefit from less clutter and more information."
3,"Interesting, but very generalized","Mr. Cook's books can teach you some things about investing, but generally only if you are a real beginner. One thing to beware of, his books are full of come-ons to get bodies into his expensive seminars. I've been to the seminars. Take my advice, you can learn just as much, if not more, from the $25 book than you will learn at the $4000 seminar. Synopsis: read the book, SKIP the seminars."
3,Educating and entertaining; but full of big promises!,"I am an experienced options trader. I have made 400% in 15 weeks (last year). I found Wade's book valuable, informative, and entertaining. BUT it is also pie in the sky. People who consistently earn above average returns don't spend their time writing and giving seminars - they end up managing their money. And the money of family and friends, either directly or indirectly. Commodity traders that consistently double money raise billions to manage in a few short years. Wade's techniques are good. His language is simple. The book is an enjoyable read. It is a real eye openner. But, read it with a few grains of salt and scepticism. He is selling the joys of risk taking to the average investor. His book explains in plain English what professionals already know. Can it help you improve your returns? Certainly. Can you lose more money? Probably."
2,Claims are suspect!,"The Book is an easy read but is a huge pitch for seminars, other books, and the WIN system. The core facts of option/rolling stocks are basically correct and the explanations of what puts and calls are, remain valid. The returns and claims of great wealth are suspect. In addition, there is not enough downside in the book. I would not recommend this book for anyone that doesn't have some exp."
1,Wade Cook is not to be trusted.,"I've read the book, and it's pretty obvious he's a con artist. The good reviews are either his employees/friends/cronies, or they are lucky.I actually went to their office and pretended to apply for a job a while back. In the interview I was asked if I'd be willing to lie to callers about how my personal money was performing. I said absolutely not. Surprise, I didn't get the job.These people are thieves, they think nothing of ruining peoples lives so they can make a profit.Save your money and go elsewhere."
5,Excellent starter book for the beginning investor,"Specifically, I like the explaination and examples on investing in Stock-Split Companies. In thirty years of trading my broker never informed me that the odds for the stock to go higher are greated in excellent quality companies when the stock splits. After reading this book. I put to work the principles as I outlined them from Wade Cooks Book and B-I-N-G-O I had twenty trades and fifteen were profitable. I bought call options using the strategies as stated using my outline from the book on Microsoft, Pfizer, Apple Computer, Compaq, Dell Computer, Interface, Delta Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Lycos, Netscape, Warner-Lambert and Monsanto. My return on my investment was approximately 800%. After reading his book I have went on the read many more books that have additionally fine tuned my options trading ability. I am very greatful to Wade Cook for writing the book and to my wife for buying it for me."
2,Only for Hawkwind Fans,"The Time of The Hawklords is but a collection of space dreaming sequences based upon the ideas of the rock group Hawkwind, with the seed of Michael Moorcock on some of its compositions and in the mood of the group as well, that is why you cannot speak about the book without referring to the music. The book itself is an exercise of baroque descrptions and actions depicting the band members as psychedelic characters travelling through the Universe in a decadent space-hulk, armed with musical weapons. The visual imaginery of the story relates it to similar parallel universes as those of the 2000 A.D. or Warhammer 40K wargaming series."
4,Can't buy this camera now!,"I was just about to buy this camera when I found out that you couldn't shoot in the RAW format.After shooting exclusively RAW for the last year and knowing all the benefits of it, I can't bring myselfto buy this camera now."
5,Great flagship to the Canon G-Series lineup.,"I own the G5 and now the G7. The G7 is a great replacement!Pros:Super-fast power-up to first shotImage qualityNice functional optical zoomRetractable lens flush with camera bodyBuilt-in lens coverVery nice ""high quality"" video modeSmall case/bodyMuch improved power-on/power-off buttonCons:Poor and unusable ""e-mail quality"" video modeThe G7 doesn't have the flip-out LCD like the G5Somewhat small right-hand grip areaYou won't go wrong with the G7.I recommend using SanDisk Extreme III SD cards with this camera for shooting speed and transfers to PC."
5,The BEST camera ever!,"I just got the camera today, and have already fallen in love with it. I love to take pictures but I can't see real well and I shake quite a bit which normally causes the picture to be blurry. BUT with this camera I don't have those problems. The screen is the perfect size and regardless of how bad I shake the pictures come out perfect!!! Definitely awesome!! Definitely a must have for anyone!"
3,A collection of world-class pianists at their best.,"The first cut is the best Fur Elise ever. if I had heard this when I was studying piano, I either would have been inspired to learn to plumb the depths of this piece further, or simply have jumped out a window, knowing I was unworthy to even attempt to play it.Most piano performances of the Grieg Wedding Day at Troldhagen are usually muddy and indistinct. With this one, we hear every note, and share Andrei Gavrilov's enthusiasm as he almost bounces off the stool performing this. I have never heard it better done.And Kempff does the Mozart K397 as well as it can be done.Some of the tracks are only portions of the work, so lovers of them may mind the omissions. My own preference is to hear a composition in its entirety, as the composer intended. One star off for that.One star off for the sound. You might not like this with in-the-ear headphones on an MP3 player.Despite my star penalties, I highly recommend owning this album."
3,Sorry I don't agree...,"This is a good collection of pieces - would've been great had better Chopin been selected, like ""Heroic"". The perfomances are all well executed. However, the BIG problem, as with many piano recordings, is the recording level. On three different stereos, to hear the softest parts, the volume has to be turned up to such a level that A) hissing is an issue and B) the crescendoes BLAST and crack the speakers. The price is right, though..."
2,Still having delivery problems,"I enjoy reading the paper on my time schedule. When I received a message ""delivery would be delayed"", I canceled. I thought they would have had that problem addressed by now."
2,Typical liberal slant,"Trying to find a paper that presents balanced, meaningfully in-depth coverage is proving difficult. Having recently moved to Denver, I thought I'd try this paper. It's like most papers. I'm not one with a ""D"" or ""R"" behind my name and like to look at issues closely without political rhetoric. Denver Post failed me. Unsubscribed."
2,Delivery Issues,I have decided to cancel my subscription after experiencing delivery issues each day for the past two weeks. I also want to see the Post include some normal features such as movie ratings in their electronic version. Someday I will go back to getting the paper electronically but right now the reading experience and delivery problems are too much of a sacrifice.
2,Unattrbuted opinion and editorial pieces?,Only in-house editorial pieces should be unattributed. The reader understands that they represent the views of the publisher and editorial board. All other pieces should include the name of the author. The Kindle edition of the Denver Post fails to meet even this most minimal standard in its Opinion section. Is it that difficult to include a by-line?
1,Love Kindle...Denver Post is extremely unreliable,"We love our new Kindle! We eagerly subscribed to the Denver Post, but what began as excitement has turned to disappointment. Out of 24 days, only 15 papers were delivered. Kindle Support can refund your money, but when you really would rather have the newspaper, we are left feeling ""let-down"". We would recommend that either you wait until all the ""kinks"" are worked out with the Denver Post, or subscribe to a more reliable newspaper."
3,Okay when it works,"I like the paper but, during the two week trial period, there was a problem receiving it on my Kindle. Not once, but twice in two weeks. Unacceptable for me so I canceled my subscription."
3,A disapointing reprint of past magazine articles,"I'm a huge Tobias fan since I read his most popular book ""The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need"" in eight grade. I'm now 35 and read everything he put out. The content of the book (car insurance lobbying,Russia, and Miami Apartments, etc were all extensive features written by him for Worth Magazine. I felt that I didn't get my monies worth with this one. If you haven't read these previously published articles then by all means buy the book for he's true to form with his way of telling stories in a humorous light."
4,good show,"I loved this show growing up. It's nice to be able to unwind while watching a show to remind you of being younger...I hope they come out with the rest of the series on dvd. She is my generation's Lizzie McGuire (which, I admit I watched and liked). She dresses quirky, but she has the self esteem to not care what other people like.Upon viewing this season, I noticed Clarissa's family had 4 different chairs at their kitchen table! I thought it started with Friends..."
5,watchin this as a youngsta,i use 2 watch this on nickeledon. its wuz tha days wen they had snick. u know watchin on channel 47 wen cable wuz tci. boy them days wuz tha best.
5,Can't Wait.,I loved this show on Nick; I can't wait for this to be on DVD an hoping for more classic Nick shows on DVD.
2,"pretty, but not challenging","I considered this for my grandson, two years old. When my own kids were small, they had such a toy with gears they could attach with velcro onto a backing, and create their own unique patterns, then turn with a knob. They had hours of fun and created myriad patterns with those. Now, is it just push a button and watch??? And why does the info say it is for three+, yet shows an infant with a pacifier...? hmm I know, I know, times do change. Not sure it is for the better."
3,A different kind of Fun..,"I purchased this toy because my son loves things that light up. I like that it's colorful and it's just something different. He's only 7 months but he takes the gears off and seems to like looking at it, the sounds are upbeat too. I think I get worried about losing the gears and not being able to replace them. I'm always finding them around the house. But overall it's an ok toy. (:"
3,Not bad,"I thought this would be quite a fun toy, however my kid's favourite thing to do with it is simply pile all the wheels into a bag and carry them around. Other children have had fun playing with it - the music is not that annoying. My daughter simply hasn't been as interested in this as I would've thought. It is sturdy, though, especially when the kids try to stop the wheel while it's automatically turning."
2,Ugh!,"This toy is so noisy and the concept seems lost on my one year old. She knows she can push the button, but is a little startled by it. She'd rather play with the cogs in the bath tub than the rest of the ""toy"""
5,Busy Gears Toy,I gave this to a friend of mine for her 13 month old. She says her 6 and 8 year old play with it too. The little one carries it everywhere and loves to dance to the music. Very durable. Batteries last a long time.
3,Okay,"I purchased this toy for my one year old after reading glowing reviews. The toy is okay but not terrific. It holds my child's attention for a much shorter time than her other toys, although other children may enjoy it more.Pros- The turning mechanism is safe enough not to pinch little fingers, just a little bit of pressure stops them from turning.- Taking the gears on and off encourages dexterity.Cons- The music is terribly annoying after a short while (although this is true of most baby toys).- The toy can't be carried by the handle because the gears fall off.- There are no spare gears provided so unless you are very diligent about keeping this toy together some will be lost."
1,Malaguena Instrumental,"I could not recognize Malaguena, the principal song Malaguena. I threw the tape away! It was a waste of good money"
5,A must-have for any b boy.,"The album is as tuff as a ""We Rock Hard"". Real hard underground b-boy breaks. If you are a B-boY you'll definetlly like it. I just cant sit and listen to it. It makes me move every time I play it. We have been dancin for it non stop yesterday while training. MUCH PROPS TO FREESTYLERS!!! They blowed my head 1nce again."
3,Different,"Very interesting mix of more eclectic cuts, with a touch of house feel to they.Good investment for the jazz lover reaching out for new and different cuts, very well produced."
2,"histoically significant, but not always very interesting","so, i fully acknowledge the historical importance of this company -- arthur miller did something completely revolutionary in his day, and i give him full props for that, but sometimes i think the quality of the actual choreography for this company is not so impressive(but i think that about alvin ailey too)... it seems that these two companies rely very heavily on the masterpieces that made them big, but that they don't always continue to make equally challenging work later. this dvd isn't terribly interesting or well-produced, but it is still valuable for its historical content. i recommend it, but not highly, to those interested in dance history, but i warn you that the work is dated and not very challenging to a more accomplished viewer."
5,Lose yourself,"Haunting, transporting you beyond your world into hers, the music stays in your head even after the last strains have died away. Close your eyes and let her lead you down woodland paths to see what surprises await around the next bend.Her interpretations of nature's beauty are enhanced by a masterful control of the keyboard."
3,Make Sure Its What You Need.,"This Software looks great. The only problems I have with it is: 1-It will not work with i-tunes. If your music files are in i-tunes forget it. They will not import to mixstation. They will tell you a couple of differnt ways to get these files to convert,but none have worked 100%. 2- No tech support: the only access you have to any kind of support is a bulletin board where you have to wait for some one to answer your question. As far as operating the software it seems to be o.k. If I could just get my i-tunes libary imported!!!!!! I have a Friend who is a House D.J. at a very large club who is running the pro version, that is AWESOME!! Hope this review helps you."
3,First Impressions of a novice,"First impression: eh.Yes, it does all the things it advertises. As you get used to the interface it does show potential.The manual is sub-par. Help files are not too helpful. This is marketed to beginners - there should be better information."
2,Wasn't pleased,"I was not pleased with this product at all, in fact I returned it to Amazon! Amazon was great about it, too! When I read the product description I thought it was going to be exactly what I had been looking for, and when I got the product, it did not do what I thought it would by the description. I'd say, if you are a regular person like me looking for a software to use for burning cd's of your own music that you have downloaded and mixed, don't go with this, go with the MixMeister, that's what I ended up getting and LOVE it!! I gave this product 2 stars because it is actually pretty interesting to use, but has a lot of things on it that the average person that doesn't do djaying wouldn't know what to do with."
1,Disappointing,"I'm a Peter Matthiesen fan. I loved ""the Snow Leopard"", ""At Play in the Fields of the Lord"", ""In the Spirit of Crazy Horse"", ""The Tree Where Man Was Born"", and ""The Cloud Forest"". So I was excited when I saw he had written a book about Antarctica.Ugh, factual inaccuracies, sloppy writing, just a dreary effort from a long time master. Nearly inexcusable for a writer of his stature."
2,Great vitamins but poor shipping,"My first order was for both New Chapter Every Woman and Every Man. When the package arrived there was almost nothing in the box to protect the content. One of the bottles was broken, I mean it was salted it wasn't just cracked. I returned it and I had to pay the shipping back. I ordered it again and when it arrived it was poorly packed like the first one. It was just luck that it wasn't broken. So I don't know if that's how they always pack those and we have to cross our fingers that the package will arrive intact with 50/50 chance or they just knowingly sent me a broken one the first time. And what's with the return shipping fee..?For all those troubles I'll give 2 stars only. The vitamins themselves are great."
3,The end of Weather Report adventure,"This is This is not like the (fifteen!) previous WR albums. After the release of ""Sportin' Life"" (beginning of 1985), Joe Zawinul and Wayne Shorter had already decided to stop their collaboration, and ""This is This"" was recorded only for contractual reasons. The Wayne Shorter contribution is not significant, the most important solo instrument is the guitar of Carlos Santana. Also there are no Shorter compositions, but you can find a nice Victor Bailey tune (""Consequently"") and some pleasant Zawinul cuts. It's probably the worst Weather Report album, but it's a good fusion CD, anyway."
3,I expected more,Overall the dvd is okay. Good ideas for some different stretches but nothing new here. I thought it was too expensive for what you actually get.
1,A Correction,"I do not wish to review the book, ""What Is Spirit,"" because I haven't read it, but I must correct your editorial review: Peter Max had nothing whatsoever to do with Yellow Submarine. The film was designed and art-directed by Heinz Edelmann."
5,DONT PAY $200+ when you can a better one right here!!!!,"The only thing I can say without swearing is this thing REALLY pounds. How can so much sound come from one twelve inch sub? I have NO IDEA. This thing sound great with the paired sealed box they have listed on this site. MAKE SURE you get an amp that puts out at least 400 watts RMS 4 ohms to really hear what kind of sound this thing makes. Let me tell you, if you get two of these, your windows might break. I can see mine vibrate and when I push it, this thing can make my head hurt. THIS SUB IS NUTS and at such a steal!!!! GET ONE NOW. You won't be disappointed at the CLEAN and POWERFUL sound this thing makes."
5,Good product,Very nice product. Have 2 of these in my car and they hit pretty hard considering no amp.
1,Good product if you can get it out of the can,"This is my favorite finish. Too bad you can't get it out of the can. I bought two of these (and they aren't cheap), the spray nozzles are awful! Very little pressure and most of it comes out in dribbles. Much of the product is left in the can when the gas runs out. The product IN the can is excellent. I'm going back to a gallon can."
3,Fascinating,"I enjoyed pondering the book and discussing the ideas with friends. I just wanted to share one of my favorite quotes from the book: ""The clock shows us the now, but no clock ever shows teh future or has ever shown the past."""
1,Horrible. Do not buy.,"When this does seem like a great deal it is not. I can not imagine anyone spending 129.99 for these speakers. Even at the $38.89 price point it is a ripoff. The first think I noticed when I got the speakers is how small they were. They sound exactly like they look. They produce no mid range what so ever. Even changing the equalizer on the computer could not make up for the lack of power the speakers had. Nothing sounds good out of the speakers and i tend to find myself using my laptop speakers over the Creature IIs because the sound quality is so bad.Also a side note. The controls on the sub woofer are backwards. To turn the bass or the treble up you turn towards the ""-"" and to turn them down you turn towards the ""+"". This is a great example about the excellent quality of these horrible horrible speakers."
1,"One year, twelve days","These speakers were great for one year and twelve days, and then they just died. No sound, just a slight squeak from the sub. Called the company, and from what I can tell this is a known issue. I paid altogether too much for a set of speakers that lasted for so little time, and my choices with them are limited. Frankly, I just tossed them and bought a less expensive system that I can live with if it dies.What makes this especially heinous at the personal level is that I had my previous speakers, a medium-expensive B.A. set that were ugly as sin for at least seven, and I think closer to ten, years. The Creature looked nice, didn't sound quite as good, and didn't last even close to as long."
4,Great look good sound,"I am not that type that is particularly sensitive to the very fine detail of the sound quality. I am looking for an overall package. This speaker is good value with trendy look and good sound quality. The only draw back is that it has only two satelltie speakers. But depends who you ask, some say less wiring rat nest is a good thing."
3,Good Looking but not Loud enough,"These speakers look really cool. But i was disapointed by its volume.......I use it to plug it to my laptop, and the sound is loud only when u sit right in front of ur computer...I ceratinly expected it to be much louder !!!However, the sound quality is really good. I would recommend it for someone who wants to use it just as an enhancement to their PC speakers and is not particular about the volume."
3,Good but could have been better,"I loved Til Tuesday's final album ""Everything's Different Now"" so I felt that I should acquire their second album ""Welcome Home"". I can't say that I enjoyed this cd as much as ""Everything's Different Now"". I love ""What About Love"", ""Coming Up Close"", ""David Denies"", ""No One is Watching You Now"" but I just couldn't get into the rest of the cd. It's good but not my favorite Til Tuesday cd."
4,Their 2nd Best Album,"I would recommend ""Everything's Different Now"" over this one, but if you already have that, this makes a great second choice. The best tracks are indeed the more popular hits, but songs such as ""On Sunday"" and ""David Denies"" are also great album cuts."
1,"silly, pretentious, and unnecessary","This is one of those books that just didn't need to be written. Its central point is terribly obvious and fairly unnecessary, and if the point HAS to be made (over and over), it could have been made easily in ten pages. After reading the book, I see that when McCabe talks about directors misinterpreting plays, what he REALLY means is directors interpreting plays differently than how HE interprets those plays. And he seems to have virtually no credentials to back up his rants. He hates dramaturgs, readings, workshops, backstory, blah, blah, blah. So who cares? I'm not sure why he's so angry and so bitter, but this horrific pandemic of rebel directors raping good plays, against which he rails, doesn't actually exist. Still, the book was interesting in some unexpected ways (sometimes for unintentional entertainment value) even though it holds no real value in any ongoing discussion of American theatre. This is really not worth the cover price..."
5,Excellent series - I read both books in a week!,"The Mercy Thompson books are very well written and I must say it took me by surprise. I had a bad experience with Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series which started out great and then turned into weird erotica nonsense. This is nothing like that. It's science fiction the way it should be. I couldn't put either book down and found myself staying up late to finish. The heroine is independant yet maintains her femininity. Mercy Thompson was raised by werewolves but is a walker - a shape-shifter whose animal form is a coyote. As described on the back of one of the books, Mercy has friends in high and low places and often finds herself in somewhat dangerous situations. She always pulls through, of course, with a little help from her friends. Try it, there's a lot to like about Patricia Briggs's writing and characterizations. I can't wait for the next book! :-)"
4,Not half bad...,"I really enjoyed the dry wit and realistic conversations that this writer delivers. Finding a writer who can write the way people really talk was fun, especially when the ""people"" are werewolves, vampires, shapeshifters, etc."
5,Got to read this!,"I was a little skeptical(didn't like the cover that much) about reading this serie but after reading the first book I had to run to the bookstore and got the rest of them! talented writer, excellent characters and fast pace! A MUST HAVE, MUST READ!"
1,"Good Story, Poor Writing","I have never written a reveiw for a book before online, but this one I had to.The writing in Moon Called is terrible. The paragraphs have sentences that nearly all begin with ""I.."". Also, the author writes about things that are irrelevant to the story, such as the actions she takes to go to bed or walk outside. There is no need for all the junk the writer puts in this book. It actually irritated me so bad becuase of these two things that I had to stop a little after the middle of teh book. Thinking it was just my mood that turned me off of this book, I tried to read it again six months later, but I couldn't make it past the third chapter.Although it was irritating having to read all of the usless facts and sentences that all begin the same, the story line is good. The idea that a shape shifter has to deal with and even help an aggressive werewolf society is very interesting. I have to admit that the story line is what kept me going for as long as I could."
1,Boring...,"I went to about pg 110 thinking it had to get better based on all the positive reviews but there is no interesting character development or plot going on here. I don't even like the characters. As someone else mentioned, the writing is not very good. I have read so much better."
4,"Fun read, bad book cover art","This is a very good series, although it edges a little to close to the Romance Novels category. The characters are strong and fun and Mercedes gets into plenty of trouble, dragging everyone else with her. Not quite as good as the Rachel Morgan series, but very close. My only concern are the book covers. If I had seen these in a store I wouldn't have touched them with a 10 foot pole. She looks like a sex enthralled biker chick. Not at all the Mercedes character."
2,Its kinda...not that great,"Its an ok book. It had just enough to keep me going...and I hate to start books without finishing them. It just has too much conversation in it. They can be talking forever and then suddenly you realize: ARE THEY EVER GOING TO SHUT UP AND GET ON WITH THEIR WOLF BUSINESS!?...or whatever it is they are supposed to be doing. I mean they spent too much time talking and not enough time ""rescuing"". It was annoying how concerned they were with their friend's love problems and not so much with the missing little girl. Overall, I would say I will probably not be buying any other books in this series."
5,Awesome Urban Fantasy,An awesome series that I give an enthusiastic two thumbs up!!! Not only a great concept but also well written which isn't always the case with the genre.
4,Moon Called didn't disappoint!,I think Moon Called was a great beginning to what promises to be a gritty urban fantasy series. I've already ordered the second in the series- Blood Bound.
5,Break from the real world,"I was given this book by a coworker who shares a love of reading and enjoys, just as I do, reading that ""weird"" stuff. I devoured Moon Called that day, then bought the other books in the series that were out at the time."
4,Wonderful!,"Moon Called is a great introduction to a series! Mercedes (Mercy) Thompson is a skinwalker - she can turn into a coyote - because she is descended from a long line of Native American shamans. Mercy owns a small repair garage and fixes primarily older forigen cars.Into her shop walks Mac - a young man recently turned into a werewolf. She takes him under her wing (and eventually introducing him to the sexy Alpha werewolf who lives behind her), not knowing that behind Mac is a lot of trouble.That's about as much as I can say about the plot without spoiling it.I really enjoyed this book. It's a very quick read and the characters are very likeable. Mercy is great and I loved Adam (the sexy Alpha werewolf next door)."
4,Four and 1/2 stars,"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I really wasn't sure about the author. Great plot, great characters was sad towards the end, well worth the money. I will look for her in the future."
5,New Fan of Patricia Briggs,I stumbled across the Mercy Thompson series when I was looking through suggestions on Amazon. This book is very well written. The characters are very well developed. It is a very fast read. I would recommend this series.
3,Pretty good but not great,"The story is pretty good but not yet up to par with the likes of Butcher, Harris or Hamiltion(her early work only) well worth the purchase price though."
5,A Great Series,"I've finally found some time to get back into reading, and on the recommendation of my best friend I started the Mercy Thompson series. I don't know if it's because I'm thrilled to finally be reading for fun again or not, but I loved this book. Mercy Thompson is a great character. I liked the shapeshifting which I didn't really think I would until I read it. I liked the writing style too. This one was a winner for me."
4,I like this book!,"I like this book!Mercedes is a rare heroine! I like the way she uses her logic instead of sentiment or impulse!I like the world she is in, the world where all othernaturals exist and they maintain the elements that we know as ""true"". Werewolves turn with the full moon and can be killed with silver bullets, vampires are bloodsucking, heartless monsters, who ""play dead"" in the morning hours and the fae are mean and ruthless creatures!I like the ""power games"" the wolves play and I like that Mercedes doesn't challenge them instead she maintains an iron grip in her independence by showing respect to their customs.Plus I love the wolves that surround her Samuel, Warren, Ben, Bran and of course Adam!!!!!"
5,Excellent supernatural series,"I finished the Mercy series and am anxiously awaiting the next book. I won't give a synopsis of the story since that's pretty well covered already in other posts, but just wanted to add my recommendations to read this series. I couldn't put them down! They are now some of my all time favorites! Definitely worth re-reading...a sign of a great book for me. Highly original world, intriguing characters, compelling story, lots of action, mystery and suspense as well as a little romance.I have been on the hunt for books similiar to the Mercy Thompson and Alpha & Omega series. The new Chicagoland Vampire series by Chloe Neill has the same sort of style...strong, likable female lead, good plotline, lots of paranormal action and suspense and a little romance. Give them a try after reading Biggs.Some Girls Bite: A Chicagoland Vampires Novel"
5,AWESOME,"I enjoyed this book so so much!! After storming through all the Charlaine Harris Sookie Stackhouse novels, my friend told me that I really needed to start this series next. I am so so grateful to her for guiding me to Mercy. This book is such a good starting point for the series, it will grab you in and get ready to not want to stop until you're done with book 4!"
3,"Nice idea, but uninteresting writing","The premise of this story sounds interesting. It COULD have been so much more! I have read other books by Briggs but this one, I had to force myself to read. I couldn't hardly get past one page before putting it down in boredom, to read a little more later. This was just not a ""grabber"" for me.I will say also, that I am not a big werewolf fan, so that may have been part of it. I like paranormal and fantasy.Maybe you will enjoy it if you are really into werewolves."
1,Amazon Item Description is Incorrect,"I bought this mouse for young children to use at a desktop computer. The size of the mouse is perfect for that use - but the product description shows a six foot cord, when in fact the cord is less than three feet. With the computer on the floor, no way this can be used. I had seen this in some of the comments but gave Amazon the benefit of the doubt. Very disappointed."
5,Very Insightful,"As a Victim Advocate, I found this story to have very truthful elements in it. Sadly, abusers don't think they are in the wrong."
1,Don't Bother,"Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is so-so, the script is week and it lacks continuity...do not purchase..."
5,WOW!,"I was expecting a ghost story, but what i got was so much better! A real love story, with real people. What could be better? You could imagine running into both these people on the street. And to be honest, it was a ghost story. A ghost who comes back to life. I love Jim Caviezel so much, and think he is seriously underrated. You have to see this!"
3,"A good ""Bad Movie""","If you're a hard core movie fan, you learn to appericate good ""Bad Movies."" There are movies that go so far off the tracks in terms of one or several essential features of film art -- casting, script, sets, pacing, editing, lighting, coherence -- that there is no way that you could, being honest, recommend them without qualifications to an unsuspecting viewer."
4,Good Movie,Different JLo movie that I have seen but yet it was very good. Made you think. Ended not the way I thought but worth watching.
4,Best of the new toothbrush's,Of all the new toothbrush's that have come out in the last year or so I like this one the best. The Power Action of it is just enough to help without being too much vibration. It doesn't have as much powered movement as most power brush's do but it's enough to help.The only thing I didn't like is that the battery didn't last very long. I have a running joke with my Sis and her husband about how the toothbrush and the razor are being re-invented every six months or so. We traded these last Christmas as joke gifts but it turned out that I really do like to use this brush.
1,Terrible Quality Toothbrush,"If Oral-B made this toothbrush so that I could insert a new battery, then I might like it better. But I've purchased 3 of these toothbrushes, and each time, they have quit working after about two weeks. That is unnaceptable. And for those who might be wondering, I don't take forever to brush my teeth. The build quality is terrible; after about two weeks, you have to push the ON button harder and harder just to get any kind of electric ""action"" from the pulsar brush. I don't generally write reviews, but I just went to brush my teeth with a new pulsar toothbrush, and guess what? It didn't work. I keep buying them, thinking I must have just bought a defective one or something. Well, no more. Unless you want an overpriced manual toothbrush that does not vibrate or do any real electric ""pulsing"" or anything like unto it, do yourself a favor and steer clear of these."
4,Justice system fails to protect society-again,"Larry Singleton a monster personified. Paroled after only 8 years because the ""assault"" with which he was charged could not give him a life sentence. Chopping off both arms of a child could produce only an ""assault conviction."" Singleton had no problem being a ""good"" convict, and got time off for good behavior. Because of our present laws designed to protect the rights of the perpertrator California taxpayers had to foot the bill to protect this monster after he was paroled. Not even local governments in the state could keep him out of their midst. Why doesn't it surprise me that another woman became his victim. At least the state of Florida doesn't fool around with it's criminals. Perhaps Singleton will pay for his victimization."
3,If you like beer/pizza and bad bad movies,This is the one for you. Definetely B movie but loads of fun with friends over or a pizza beer and bad movie night
3,The Basics,"This unit is good to get you by if you plan to travel to a lot of these countrys, but to have a one on one conversation with some one thier is not enough vocabulary to get your point accross.The operation of the item is a little time consuming to switch back and forth from language to language."
3,Average Bosa with One Outstanding Song,"I bought this CD for Cris Delanno's Fotographia, which turned out to be the only outstanding piece of this album (in my opinion). The dreamy, sexy voice of Cris Delanno with the song's illusional tune truly stands out from the rest of beaty bosa songs."
4,Worth it,"I love this DVD. I first started watching soap on my On Demand on cable because my bf loved it when he was younger. So i watched and i enjoyed it, but then they took it off so i had to get the 4th season on DVD and it was well worth it. Very funny and some unexpected things happened. This is def a Soap (opera)."
5,Great Series. Should have an ending.,Tremendously funny show. Chuck and Bob are perhaps the most under appreciated comedic team in history. I only wish they had a movie to end the storie.
3,Phone Battery,Battery didn't last as long as I thought that it would. I would probably buy this product again if I had to. Next time I will probably just buy another phone.
5,Oooooo!!!,"I realize this book is intended for the risque, and a specialized market, but I suggest everyone take a peek at it!! It's fun, cover is discreet, and as a source of humour in the bedroom - It can't be beat!! Enjoy!!"
5,Great fun!,"Weebles are the most awesome toy. Now, Playskool has taken it to a new level. I just love their integration of fairytales and weebles to futher facilitate our children's imagination and playtime."
1,Think about what happends if your sink fails,"We built a house and selected this sink from a catalog a little more than a year ago. The sink has developed a crack near the drain. The sink is covered by a warranty. The problem is that you have to pay for shipping and labor. The shipping is just a small insult and does not amount to much money. It is the thousands of dollars that we have to pay to replace the sink that really sucks. To get at the sink requires removing the granite, which requires removing the stone above the granite. We do not have the final bill, but it is safe to say it is thousands and many-many times the cost of the sink. And then we have another sink that could easily fail and then we have to pay again."
1,"DON'T BUY FROM ""BUY PLUMBING""","I purchased a siligranit sink from the company, ""Buy Plumbing"" through Amazon. It was damaged during delivery. They have a 15% restock charge, even though it was damaged while being delivered. Then I reordered a new one, but it wouldn't arrive on time (this whole time we are sinkless from the remodel). Then I told them to cancel the order and they said I HAD TO ACCEPT THE DELIVERY, so they also charged me for the new sink to be delivered and returned, even though I refused shipment and told them that I didn't want it. I disputed with my CC company and they are still charging me $139.79, because they sent a damaged sink. Buy from a local company, so you can return it the same day, if there is a problem. There are often, I was told by our plumber, problems when these siligranit sinks are shipped. Whatever you do, save yourself the aggravation and expense of dealing with this awful company."
2,Looks dirty after every use,"I got the blanco sink in brown on a recommendation. The color is beautiful BUT it is impossible to keep clean. It never occurred to me that a kitchen sink would need wiping dry after every use. I just found that out on their website. That is crazy! I wish I had looked at that before I bought it. After even just washing hands a white film remains and it looks dirty. Someone suggested putting mineral oil on it once a month to help alleviate this problem. That is my next attempt. If I could change sink color for white, I would.The pros of the sink are that it is very deep and great for washing large pans."
2,"OK for Pictures, not video","This device works with Windows 98 (Windows ME with a download from the manufacturer's web site). Macintosh is also supported. It can only capture 160x120 mpeg video on Windows. Not what you want to digitize your video collection. Still, works well enough for the occasional video email. I found the software rather inflexible, and I wonder why they support a higher capture rate on Mac than on Windows."
1,Never got it to work....,"After a number of re-installations and re-boots, I called the company, who sent me an upgrade disk. It caused errors as well. After calling about them, and getting no help, I returned the product."
1,"""High Resolution"", not likely!","If you're looking for a product to do anything margianally serious with, this is not for you. The highest capture size that is not distorted is 320 x 240... It's just not worth the time or money at this resolution..."
5,Smooth!,"This sixth Toto LP has a keyboard rich, smooth jazz feel. It includes two awesome keyboard solos and even a guest appearance by Miles Davis. (He's the LEAD on the instrumental ""Don't Stop Me Now"") The best track is ""Could This Be Love,"" but the hit single ""I'll be Over You"" is also great. (It has Michael McDonald as a backup vocal.) An excellent album!"
3,Tepid Toto,"Fahrenheit finds Toto in a rut after the spark of their two previous albums Toto IV and Isolation, although the arrangement of ""Could This Be Love"" is almost as remarkable as that of ""Stranger in Town"" from Isolation. ""Can't Stand It Any Longer"" is particularly bland and ignorable, while ""Fahrenheit"" is a lame stab at mid-80s Kenny Loggins dance-pop. Many of the other ballads, however, are an improvement, especially ""I'll Be Over You"" which showcases Steve Lukather's ability to play economical yet soaring guitar solos. ""Lea"" is also nice, although you gotta wonder about a guy who compares his girlfriend to a concertina. The whole album is worth the purchase just for Miles Davis' performance on ""Don't Stop Me Now."""
1,Just trying to make money,"There were, and still are many beliefs about Jim's life. All this book does is exploid those beliefs."
1,Great photos,"A ""researched"" book about Pam not endorsed by her family? A ""love"" story about Jim Morrison and Pam? How can the author ignore the other women in Jim Morrison's life? As the years went by Pamela was not the only love of his life. The only tragedy in this romance pertains to Pam's heroin addiction and subsequent overdose of the same. Angels Dance and Angels Die is a fair-weather book written to capitalize on the money to be made in the subject."
2,Best thing in the book are the colored pictures.,"This book gets one star for a short autobiography of Pam, and the 4 color pictures in the book. As for being informing on the relationship between Jim and, Pam this book fails big time. Patricia Butler doesn't really tell the reader anything to show Pam was anymore special than anyother girl in Jim life. furthermore to compare Jim and Pam to romeo and juliet is absourd. Jim and Pam are both dead and, only one of them could accuretly tell the true story of their love for one another. That is way Patricia Kennealy book is so much interesting to read. If your interested in some nice color pictures of Jim and Pam this book has them."
1,"No ""biography"" here -- Don't be fooled","It's not a biography. It's an overblown book report/slam book entry. Sophomoric, brainless, devoid of style, and hopelessly mushy (in all the wrong ways), Angels Dance and Angels Die is no tribute to Pamela, to Jim, or to their relationship. This is the book the author tried for six years to write? It seems she should have tried a little longer. No book on Jim is perfect -- they all have their flaws, which of course reflect upon their authors. All this book reflects are Butler's failed aspirations as a biographer (getting it published doesn't mean it's any -good-), and frankly, that's not worth the investment of the cover price or the reading time. Memoirs like Strange Days and Light My Fire may also be clouded by the author's personal agendas, but at least they are honest memoirs -- not psuedo-facts and rumors tarted up as legitimate biography. Jim deserves better. Pamela deserves better. And the readers deserve better."
1,i really hate it,"the size is toooooooo small and they show you like is bigger, is expensive for this size. i dont use it."
4,Good supplemental material.,"I bought this book to coordinate with our history curriculum for our homeschooling this year. My daughter loves it so much that she's already been reading it, and we haven't even made it far enough in the curriculum to use it yet. She loves the pictures, reads portions of it nearly every day, and keeps asking if it is time to read the book for school yet. I love that we found a book that piques her 5 year-old interest and is educational as well!"
1,"If your buying this TOY for a child, DON'T!!","I purchased this toy for my child's Birthday, The cape was completely wrinkled and could not be unwrapped, her lightening streak did not work, with in 1 day her arm fell off. I contacted the company who told me most of their buyers were collectors and they could not guarantee that a 20 yr old toy would work though did not mention this prior to purchase, also they did not mention any solution or accept a return!! Amazon did not stand by it's promise my back purchases so this was an awful Experience from ToyBiz and Amazon."
4,Found this book and was amazed by the cover!,"This is one of the fear street books that I've been looking for for a long time. I finally found it at my local library and went nuts just thinking about what RL Stine did in this story to make it scary. Anyway, it's about a girl named Selena who finds a love of acting at her highschool and is always the star of the plays there. After one of the plays, she finds a bouquet of dead roses in her locker. She is ""haunted"" by a secret admirer who leaves behind a sticker of the sun on every one of his notes. No, I'm not going to give it all away, but I will tell you that the ending really surprised me. If you love RL Stine as much as I do, and you know how he likes surprises, you should find this book and be sure to think about it as you read."
4,not scary but a good suspense,"i have always love books by R. L. Stine and really enjoyed this one. One of the reason that i liked it so much is because i could picture myself as the main character as i love to act and am known for my acting skills at school. i prefer the more scary books but again, this was a good book. i'm usually really good at guessing the endings but didn't guess this one. Go Fig?even though i guess i am considered too old to be reading his books i can't help myself. they are good to read right before i go to bed. i recommend all of R. L. Stine's books for young adults and the younger at heart such as myself."
5,Great LED Light - Rugged and Reliable,"These tiny LEDs are perfect for just about any application. Just clip them on and you have instant light whenever you need it. I picked mine up for about $5, so the price here is a little steep. I used it for an entire year without any failures. It is still going strong! Highly recommended!"
2,For Beginners,"This book might be helpful to beginners on neopets.com, but it would be a waste of time for people 3 months+. It is also helpful for building a great TCG deck, but I wouldn't spnd my money on it if you're not interested in Neopets TCG."
1,Get ready for repetious scenes and bad 80's music,"Being from Colorado and having seen the beautiful scenery I was hoping for a lot more out of this DVD. The scenes are ok at best and are repeated throughout the film, as if somehow the director didn't think I the audience would pick on that. The soundtrack is prototypical 80's mood music and should probably be muted to get any sort of satisfaction out of this dreadful ensemble. I recommend something from the BBC collection paired with music of your liking."
5,an astonishing piece,"I saw this film after the high praise my friend gave it (he'll be appearing in the play, in sean penn's part). Sweet merciful lord; I was blown away.It was certainly hard to watch. The characters are so mutilated, so despicable, so confused that it solidified my desire to never try cocaine. Spacey and Penn are astonishing, as are all the smaller characters. The film gave me a lot of food for thought - and, contrary to some of the other reviews seen here, I learned a lot from it in terms of how not to deal with the hurdles life places in your way.Christ on a bicycle, it's good."
1,Yawn,This movie was so boring. The acting was good. I'm always impressed with Kevin Spacey. But ugh. Even the acting couldn't save this drone.
2,A WASTE OF TIME,"When I was younger, I had the habit to see each movie until its end and I can't remember having left a theatre in the middle of a projection. But, as years go by, time becomes more valuable and I don't have now the faintest scruple to eject a DVD when the movie is boring.So I've seen maybe one hour of HURLYBURLY before giving up. This movie has all the defaults of this wave of films trying to imitate the best Woody Allen's movies. Narcissism of the director who has certainly given birth to this thing after years of intellectual masturbation, terrible waste of the talent of the good actors involved in the project and a subject that is not the least universal and will only arouse the interest of the so-called artistic circles of Los Angeles.Nothing else. I'm gone.A DVD for the others."
5,One of the best movies ever seen,Hurlyburly is one of my favorite movies. It's crazy but really cool. If you haven't bought already it buy it!
1,Absolutely Awful!,"I don't hate too many movies, but this is one of them. The movie is absolutely awful, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It drags on (and on and on...) and I kept wondering what the point was. Unfortunately there is no point. I was singing praises to the Almighty when it finally ended! If you have 2 hours to waste, buy this movie. If not, SKIP IT!"
1,MOVIES LIKE THIS ARE AN INSULT TO THE VIEWERS,"I have one word for this manipultive, meaningless, contrived waste of time and space movie .. PATHETIC. I can think of no good reason why this movie should be in existence. Although their acting is good .. Penn and Spacey should be ashamed and I lose respect for them being part of this trash. You know you have a real loser when you can fast forward constantly and you don't miss ANYTHING! Meg Ryan is an absolute JOKE in this movie. Send Hollywood a message .. Burn this movie!! We deserve better than this crap -- especially from two fine actors such as Penn and Spacey."
5,Nothing Virtual about Digital Illusion,"Clark Dodsworth has made an enormous contribution to this subject by combining chapters from all the big thinkers in this industry.Some chapters did not appeal, others enthralled me and as I hilited gems along the way through this book I realised that my own concepts of perception and communication were evolving. It was nice to find support and to be challenged as well in the many contributions of this book.Dodsworth insight and experience helps to stitch all of the contributions and any loose ends together.Digital Illusions provides many benefits to any reader who has an interest in this industry. I found the investment of my time worthwhile."
3,What you see is what you get,"Best part is the union type fitting it came with...rest is just expesive plastic. It does come with a mesh insert to filter the water as it passes through. However, I'm not sure how the plactic filter gate is going to stay on. If you glue it on, how will you change the filter? If you don't glue, what will keep it in place? I plan to use some plastic bender board as side rails but seems like this could have been addressed for the price..."
1,"Stravinsky, ""Bolero""","First I was disappointed as the product was promoted as a DVD. I learned after calling the producer that it is strictly an audio but uses technology normally employed for videos, hence DVD. They admitted it's confusing.Second disappointment. This CD will not play in my car's CD player, - an error message is displayed. Apparently it's only compatible with CD/DVD players.The performance is good but I'm disappointed and sorry I purchased this item."
2,Fluf,"This book is full of fluff, yes it does have some good info in it, but it makes the reader work too hard. IMHO this book (like many other computer books) has too much flash. I want something that is more condensed.If you are a newbie, a dumb newbie at that, get this book. If you are intelligent please for the love of god stay away from this book. While it isn't the worst 30 bucks I have ever spent, it comes close."
2,It's ok,Cheaply made item. Not usable with anything bigger than a point and shoot camera. Mounting my small dslr on it caused it to become weak and not lock neatly into each section. Anything bigger and it became unsteady and looked as if the gear would snap off. Def not trusting my bigger more expensive cameras on it.
5,panorama,"If you want to take panorama photos, this is a must. Makes taking the photos easy. You take 12 shots and use your stitching program and makes a great panorama photo. You can see mine here [...]"
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT,"Well, I thought this was going to be a great movie from reading about it but it isnt! It is very boring. the plot is ruined by several different things. The main characters are probably what ruin this movie the most. The other characters, such as Clef and and Alcyone are awesome. This movie could be good, but there is something about it that makes you never want to watch it again! Don't waste your hard earned money on this! Trust me, I unfortunately did and now regret it!"
4,An enjoyable 4 star read.,"I haven't read any material from Stan Lee for years. I also haven't read any material from Mobiues in years. So reading this graphic novel was a treat for me.The story was solid. The art was solid. Everything about the book was solid.It was not a masterpiece, but still I found it to be a solid 4 star read."
1,DIDN'T SELL ME,"Yeah I took the other reviewers word for it on this book so I raced to the store to buy it. I started reading and I will be honest with you, the storyline was awful. If you are into Indians without any factual claims then maybe it is for you. But as for me I need a little more substance. Sorry in my opinion it was awful."
2,"The sad end of a great, if overlooked group","Always led by the prolific James Mtume, and usually anchored vocally by the great underrated Tawatha Agee, Mtume made some undeniable old school classics in the early 80s. This album, the last by the group, is missing about 90% of what made all previous efforts so outstanding. Not very many good songs, and several spoken parts (some of which seem to not make much sense). ""Body & Soul (Take Me),"" is the last great slow ballad that they made, and ""I Don't Believe You Heard Me"" is a rollicking, bouncy, James Brown-inspired funk number, but aside from these 2 selections, the rest of this album lacks the focus and solidity of previous efforts."
5,20+++++++++++++++ stars,"This has just made my life. I've been waiting, hoping against hope, that Nickelodeon, in its increasingly small-minded and MTV-polluted soul, would deem the public worthy of enjoying one of the greatest shows I personally have ever seen. This was a loooong time coming: there is a god, and this is his nectar."
5,Amazing work,"This masterpiece should be givin an oscar. I dont meant one of those MTV things, I mean a real oscar. This is wonderful, one of the best motion pictures you will even incounter in your entire being. Im serious, buy this now. These creators should be commended for their hard work and wonderful story plots. Do you guys remember the episode when Ardie was cleaning the gutters and blew the leaves all over Pete's dad. Hilarious footage. How bout the one when Pete was grounded in the garage and decided to dig his way out into the front yard. All he had was as statue of liberty figure to dig. This is real life, im serious. These things could happen to you guys, so watch this show, and now what to do. Buy it, its amazing, like I said. A masterpiece, work of art, greater than the monalisa itself...-Doug FunnieOut and about."
4,a classic,this show is just as good as i remember! a perfect example of what being a kid in the 90's was like.
5,"Awesome video, takes me back in the day","This show was so awesome, it showed real looking people, not just the beautiful people, doing the things that every kid wanted to do. Awesome background music and some of the best t.v. I've ever seen to this day. If you ever watched this show you know how good it is and this collection contains some of the best episodes of the whole show (if you ask me they were all equally as good).This is a show for the whole family both the kids and adults, you never have to worry about it containing things that are too racey and it never gets boring, repetitive, and annoying like most childrens shows. Do yourself a favor and pick up this awesomely hysterical show on DVD."
5,Episode List,1: Day of the Dot (Big Pete battles with the marching band)2: Nightcrawlers (Little Pete tries to extend his bedtime)3: King of the Road (the family goes on a road trip)4: Tool and Die (big pete goes through shop class)5: Rangeboy (Big Pete gets a job at Dad's driving range)6: When Petes Collide (The Petes battle for Dad's bowling ball)7: Don't Tread on Pete (Big Pete learns about the Revoloutionary War)8: Hard Day's Pete (Little Pete searches for his favorite song)
4,Almost Master Network Security,"Overall this text is slightly better than good. After reading almost the whole book I found that for someone interested in theory and not so much in technique, this is a good read. It does go over some good points about planning your security model and gives good advice on how to approach security in your organization. It even goes through a basic install of CheckPoint FW-1 for NT. Topics including policy, legal issues and the user's ability to comply with policy are interesting but not why I bought this book. I thought Chris put some good information in this text but the title doesn't accurately match the content."
1,Not worth the time,"The book was a disappointed (I bought it because it was featured in Fast Company magazine). The subhead ""Getting your message heard in a noisy word"" was misleading. The answer from the book -- ""get a lot of very creative advertising, with controversial themes (such as allusions to sex - 'pen envy?') What a joke. This book will only be useful if you manage million dollar TV ad campaigns, which an average marketing person is very far from.Also the tone -- Look how great and smart we are! -- was condescending.In short, I did not get much from this book."
3,it was ok,"i didn't think this was the best of kid's pageant videos, it focused on the 8-10 age group which was OK but not nearly as interesting as it could have been if they had shown the younger ones more like in Living Dolls. Another point is that this video only covers a state pageant and i feel that the tension could have been greater at the nationals with even more 'big' names competing. Overall i think this video is worth a look if you are interested in it but not if you want to really see high level competition."
2,Just plain awful!,"In looking back, this album marked the beginning of Dans creative decline as a songwriter/recording artist. Glimpses of his earlier musical genius show through with songs like Lonely In Love, The Way It Must Be and She Don't Look Back. Unfortunately these highlights are overshadowed by far too many weak spots. The production is Big-80's all the way, which has always grated on my nerves because up until this point Dans productions never sounded like anyone elses. Just a plain awful album overall. One of his weakest to date."
1,Anything But Romantic!,"Sorry I can't share the sentiments of the other reviewers. Actually I bought this movie based on all the wonderful reviews and could not sit through the film! The most reviting part of this movie is the beautiful lead actor playing Angel. The story was very dull and slow moving. There is nothing erotic about the movie, however that was not the reason for me buying the film. I thought it was a gay romance against the backdrop of a heist which the movie does not deliver. The two actors are absolutely straight and are not at all convincing as gay lovers. I fell asleep twice trying to sit through it and fast forwarded to the end which is where (I suppose) the action to this melodrama lies and ended up sucking my teeth and turning off the DVD."
2,Oy!,"This DVD is nearly unplayable in my DVD player, and I was only able to view ""Advancer Tina"" in its entirety. The other 2 titles get stuck in the middle or explode in a flurry of pixels. The audio also gets erratic. The photo gallery and the extra trailers were fully playable though.I tried it on my comp, it also makes my DVD software go haywire. *_*Was there quality control at any point? I would have liked to view all three titles scot-free."
2,Deceptive Title,"Definitely a book of analysis, but do not look for any ""Art"". If you are thinking this book will teach you ""how"" to analyze chess positions, think again. This is a book for strong players.The analysis of the games selected is very deep, and some valuable observations are shared with the reader. If you study the selected games and commentary, you will undoubtedly gain some valuable information, perhaps even some insight, but you are unlikely to learn anything new about ""how"" analysis should be performed.If you are a mid-range player looking for some ""how to"" suggestions on evaluating positions, consider instead ""Better Chess for Average Players"" by Tim Harding, especially the chapter on ""choosing a move"", or even ""Secrets of Practical Chess"" by John Nunn, although the latter approaches the subject more broadly and a little less concretely."
3,Tradewinds Legends is better,"If you don't have Tradewinds Legends then buy it first. If you've played that to death and still want more, then buy Tradewinds 2. TW Legends is the same price, is a better game, and has better graphics."
3,"Interesting, but not one of King's Best",Stephen King's adaptation of The Kingdom seems to have been filtered through his own harrowing experience of being stuck by a truck while walking beside a road. His take is too long and wanders too much I much preferred the original version produced for Danish TV.
5,Stop Looking.,This is the one. Stop looking. I've read them all. You learn to trust Benson's judgement very quickly. He probably isn't perfect. But he takes chances in his interpretation that ring true. He is also an articulate critic of Steinbeck's writing. Beautiful biography!
2,Good for a start not as a reference,I found this book lacking in enough detail to get through even the simplest problems. Details published in footnotes were as important as the text. I would not recommend this book as a teaching aid without the aid of additional text.
1,Poor in all respects.,"I had the extreme displeasure of having to use this book in an undergraduate course called Linear Signals and Systems. It is poorly written and laid out first off. The ideas and concepts are half formed and the proofs are all well over any student's head who has only had one class in differential equations (rendering them pointless, for it is intend for just such people). I would actually sit down sometimes, tell myself that the book couldn't be as bad as I had it pegged, and try to read over the material that had been covered in class to learn it. I always ended up flipping pages, frustrated, sure that I had missed a page or paragraph somewhere, but I never had. It's that bad. Don't buy this. I wound up selling it before the class was over and relying on my notes and my old Ciruits text book, which was quite good (it was also written incidentally by J. David Irwin, the head of our department)."
2,terrible sound quality,"I bought this DVD must because of Tracy Chapman (who seems like never will record a live concert DVD). The sound is just terrible. Tracy Chapman's bass player is louder than everything, you can't hear her voice.the other bands are a little better but the DVD is not worth - don't spend your money on this, I fully regret"
5,"Great Bruce, Gabriel/Youssou, Chapman, Radiohead, and Zep","The sound is quite good overall, camera work likewise. Well worth getting if you're a fan of one or more of the main acts.Bruce plays alone, and does a great bottleneck guitar blues version of ""Born.""OK, so Zep isn't a charter member of the PC rock club, but they showed up and really burned. Caveats: ""Babe IGLY"" was a bit bombastic, and Plant looked and sometimes sounded too old to be doing the Zep material. Given that their ""Welcome to Clarksdale"" album generally sucks, the first P&P tune, from that album, was damned good, with a blistering yet cerebral solo from Page."
5,Great book for us non-astronomy experts,"I bought this book expecting to read the usual stuff about why some people think that the moon landing was a hoax and how astrology doesnt really work (as explained on the cover). But i was suprised to learn about so many things that I actually thought really did exist in the world of astronomy. I really did think that the water spun in a different direction in australia, and that the sky was blue because thats what a lot of oxygen looks like and many other things that turned out not to be true. Many times i thought ""oh what! that isnt real!?""There is also a nice section that takes delivers a blow to the creationists and their wacko claims.I highly reccomend this book to anyone curious about astronomy and anyone that wishes to learn about all the ailment of bad astronomy that you never knew you suffered from."
4,The perfect bedtime story to read on Christmas Eve.,"I discovered this book during the past holiday season and was taken in by the simplistic, yet beautiful re-telling of the Christmas story. Giving life to the words, the illustrations are enchanting. My niece and I enjoyed sharing this book together and I look forward to reading it to my own children on Christmas Eve for many years to come."
3,Somewhat better than a B film of the 40's,The film is an early science fiction one with a mythical monster come aliveand being directed by a evil genius to murder people.There is no secret who he is from the very first!A romance between a 40's radio detective and the daughter of the villainis the side light of the story.How the mystery of the vampire flying serpent is solved is worth watching.I liked the film and it is actually somewhat better in quality than mostof the similar films of the time.
3,Cousin Sebastian from the Donovan series,"Entranced by Nora Roberts is the second book in the Donovan series which tells the tale of three cousins blessed with extraordinary talents.Sebastian Donovan, cousin to Arianna and Morgana, is blessed with not only charm and good looks, but clairvoyant powers as well. When he is asked to help find a child whose been kidnapped he never expects to find love as well.Like many of Nora Roberts' other series books, this title was a fast and enjoyable read with pleasant characters."
4,Good way to spend a rainy afternoon,"While Ms. Roberts' books will never keep you spell-bound, the paranormal ones are extremely entertaining. I don't particularly care for just the romantic ones but these will keep your attention."
4,Entranced,"The characters are real, and yet not, they bring you into their lives and you are captured."
1,Horrible audio!,"I wish i could rate it lower. The tape was hot, but only after i set it on fire rather than risk it escaping out to someone else."
3,Not for 5Gen. Video Ipods!,"This kit seems to have products that are useful for Ipod users that are always on the go. However, despite the description the wireless receiver is not compatible with the Video Ipods.I purchased this item assuming the description was accurate, however the description is directly from Nyko and is false. I tried to plug in the receiver however, its not compatible."
2,"Well acted, but unsatisfying, I'd say.","We were two people who saw the film, and we both agreed that while well-acted, the word that came to mind was ""unsatisfying."" Some strong scenes, and some good acting, but some of the dialog was - I can only call it - ""artificially sharp."" (But that might be the way the characters were supposed to be, according to the writer.) We were sort of looking forward to seeing the film just end, to be honest. I recorded it from TV, and have now erased it."
1,"Horrible, even for B movie standards","This movie is complete garbage from start to finish. The writer does do a good job of making you hate all of the main characters, although im not sure if that is intentional. Everyone in this movie is racist, except the white guy. Everyone refers to white people as krackers very freely throughout the entire movie. Also, there is no payoff. I could possibly live with the racism if they all got brutally slaughtered, but the few kills are very badly done. I know this is low budget, but they could have put some effort into the deaths. Stay very far away from this one, even if you love b-movie horror like i do."
1,This is honestly the worst movie I have ever seen.,"I couldn't even get through the first twenty minutes because they were mind-numbing. Clumsily shot, horribly lit, and terribly acted. And this coming from a man who loves cheesy b movies. This isn't even a B movie. Nor a C movie. Or a D movie for that matter. God, please avoid and do not blame me if you have morbid curiosity."
4,Cute grill!,The grill is very cute and my son enjoys grilling the hotdogs and hamburgers for us. Like other reviewers have said it is a little on the small side but still fun for the kids.
2,Charlie Coal the Talking Grill,"The toy was cute and child loved it. However, there was no way to add batteries because of such small screws. No one has a screwdriver that small around the house, so he didn't get to fully enjoy the ""talk"" and ""noises"" of the utensils."
5,Useful as a mortising chisel,"The Sorby, Hirsch, and Ray Iles mortising chisels were all way out of my budget and my bevel edge chisels were getting wedged in when I was cutting some large and deep intersecting mortises in workbench legs. I wish Amazon had pics, these are not thick like mortising chisels, but seem to be the standard size and shape without the side bevels. I looked around and saw that 3/8 was the most useful chisel size for mortising if you only have one. It didn't take long to flatten the back and change the bevel to 25 deg. Even if you leave it at 30 deg. it still must be honed. The edge has held through chopping the mortises and I have been hammering away with my mallet (I was much more worried about my shop-made mallet than the chisels edge). Although it doubtless doesn't compare with the above brands, IMO its utility for this purpose combined with the price tag merit 5 stars."
5,nice book for GRE,"I gotta say this book helped me a lot in the preparation for the GRE. I started to study GRE seriously in the September and took the exam on December. I found this book in the library, and i liked its choice and explanation of the words. It's not like other word books where they give you too much words and too little explanation. Anyway, I went through the whole book and tried to memorized all the words, and the result is 700 in verbal (my high school sat verbal was 550)! Can't be more satisfied. Of course i used some other books too, but this book was one of the most effective in increasing my gre score."
5,awesome!,"Fantastic Game it has role playing you develop a career within the mafia and you still play parts of the movie it can`t be better well maybe with better graphics on a powerful console like an ps3 but you have with the wii the beautiful blackhand edition to take some justice with your ""own hands""!!"
5,My first love on the wii,"What an amazing game. Made me love the console. Beating up wise guys with my own two hands!Great fun and a piece of gaming art. The story rocks, the character is free to do a whole lot, the action is intense etc.. And, the involvement of the character in the movies is legendary. I killed those fellas that shot Sunny at the toll plaza. Forgetaboutit!"
5,Ordered as a Gift,"Ordered the game as a gift for one of my grandchildren. They haven't said much about it, but I know I spent a great deal of time looking for this EXACT game and could only find it on Amazon, so I'm sure they're satisfied and enjoying it."
1,Boothill Disappointment,Buyer beware. The Boothill DVD in this collection was cracked! So I guess we'll go with...the product quality stinks.
1,This is a commercially produced DVD?,"I remember enjoying two of these movies in the theaters when they were first released in the US; not high art, but broad humor can be very funny. After seeing Terence Hill in another movie on the TV I mentioned the ""Trinity"" movies to my kids and decided to order copies of the movies for my sons to watch. These have to be the poorest quality commercially produced videos I've ever seen. The color is faded, the image is less than clear: they appear to have been poorly filmed from a television screen. Save your money."
2,"Great old western, poor quality","It was great to introduce the children to this series of old spaghetti westerns which they enjoyed. I really struggled to get past the incredibly poor quality. I see from the clips used from these movies on the Sprint vs Cingular download speed ad that the original quality is obviously poor, pity."
1,Funny Once,"I remember these movies as being funny, but the quality of the transfer and the aspect ratio of the DVD's in this set is pretty awful. Hard to watch and enjoy the occasional bits of humor. Too bad."
3,Nice shots of a select pair of Voyager regulars.,"The shots provided are good, but it is extremely short on B'Elanna and Kes, and extensive on 7-of-9 and especially the Captain. Anyone particularly interested in these two, you have a winner. As a female fan of Star Trek who always hoped to see stronger female characters, it's a positive thing to me to see some of the Voyager women showing their stuff, though."
4,great tweezers,i think that tweezerman is the best around! i've had the same pair for maybe 10 years so i decided it was time to replace them (even though tweezerman does sharpen them for free) the stainless steel slant tweezers are perfect for precision. i only gave it 4 stars because it can miss the very fine hairs. (but who can see those anyway?)
5,Best tweezers I've ever used,I recommend these to anyone who has ever had fine hairs that are difficult to pull. They work exceptionally well.
5,Tweezerman Tweezers,Best tweezers I have ever had and I have bought a lot and I mean a lot of tweezers. Read about them in a beauty magazine and they are really the best.
5,Great Tweezers,I have used Tweezerman tweezers for many years and decided it was time for a new one. This one is terrific - I can't imagine how I lived without it. It can get those tiny short hairs without breaking the skin. I highly recommend it.
2,tweezerman,"I was disappointed in this product. It was supposed to be slanted, but the slant is very small making it almost straight. Because of the small slant it has to be held almost at a right angle, which I find uncomfortable. I also found that it is too sharp and cuts off as many hairs as it pulls out."
3,Really good at first,"Very good at first, but after a week was already getting blunt, even though i kept the plastic cap on it whenever not in use. Disappointing for the price. Nice color though."
5,Some things in life are worth spending extra,"I've owned many tweezers in my life time, always picking up the generic standard tweezers from the grocery store and always being frustrated by the lack of quality. Finally, after years of tweezer frustration (as silly as that sounds), I decided to spend the extra $10 to get a pair of Tweezerman tweezers after reading others reviews. Just got to say that spending the extra money is well worth it for the quality and frustration free tweezing. Don't have to worry anymore that I can't get the smallest of hairs because these tweezers pick up everything. Thank you Tweezerman, and thank you Amazon for offering the best price around."
2,Lots of breakage,"I was very excited when i ordered this because I had read a lot of positive reviews. It was a bit of a splurge as far as I am concerned, and once I used it, I was very disappointed. The product was as advertised but way too sharp--it caused a lot of breakage so even though it had a good grip, it didn't really pull the hair out. Overall, I wouldn't have bought this product if I had the chance again."
5,Awesome!!!!,This product is awesome! It works so good on the short stubborn hairs my husband and I get on our chins (&his neck). Super good for eyebrows too! Wish I could give it 6 stars!
3,Buy the Hardcover version,"This is an excellent cookbook. We have enjoyed EVERY recipe we have made - my Chinese father-in-law (who politely overlooks my need to follow recipes) declares many of the dishes from China, ""authentic."" The pictures are fabulous and the historical information about each country/region is very interesting. This book offers a delicious ""peek"" at select culinary delights of each culture represented. The hardcover version rates 5 stars - the paperback is the same oversized format/dimensions as the hardcover, making it VERY cumbersome. There is virtually no way to store nor use the book; hence, the 3 stars for the paperback."
4,"with commentary, special.","At first glance, this film may push away some viewers with it's eccentric and erotic style but it's a film with different layers to it. Watch the behind the scenes, the film opening and the speech by Jon Jacobs and the more spiritually inclined will get what he talks about.Watch the film with the commentary from the director and you may also see another side to the movie, beyond the obvious bizzare and entertaining, low-budget film.It's like a ""midnight show, cult film"", it stands in it's own category."
3,VAMPIRE!!!!!,"Interesting vampire film. The video quality of the Alpha DVD print isn't bad, but suffers from a quite bad audio dropout at one point and a couple of splices interrupting dialogue twice."
2,Weak selection of african names from the mother country!,"This book was very disappointing, there were too many names that were of other origins beside Africa and I wanted african names for my child. The african names it had, the very few there were, should have had the way to pronounciate them, which would have been a help. Anyhow, I have used the many websites for african names to find a name for my child. I would have done better with another book."
3,ok book,"but it depends on what you're looking for. i didn't realize that an african-american baby name book would include so many names from europe, etc. but our country is very diverse, so i guess that's where the ""american"" part comes in. it's a good book with plenty of names to choose from."
5,The Westland Series Is A Must For Any Serious Fantasy Fan,"While I had some reservations regarding the first two books in the series, now that I have read the fifth, any hesitancy I may have had in recommending this series has been dispelled. I can think of only five works that excell or are its equal: The obvious ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""The Mists of Avalon,"" ""Chronicles of Thomas Covenant,"" the ongoing ""Wheel of Time,"" and the current ""A Song of Ice and Fire."" And, lover's of ""The Mists of Avalon"" should particularly like this work, as it continues a celtic realm in a somewhat similar vein. You will need to start with the first book, despite its flaws, or you'll find yourself somewhat lost, as was an earlier reviewer, but I believe you'll discover yourself quickly entranced by the world of the Westlands, and find Kerr's realms intriguing and originally rendered. I find her treatment of the Wildfolk particularly engaging."
5,A Hypnotic Drama,"Have the series and must say that I cannot get enough of this drama. There are so many different subtle pieces in dialogue, set design articles and wardrobe that make it a great camp/cult classic. Hope these videos resurface for others to enjoy. Wish there were more in the series to view."
5,Great Book!,This Book Is Great! Especially If you like fairys! I read this Book And I Love It! You Should Read It!
4,Best of the Bay,"When you think of the top Rappers from the Bay Area, E-40, Too Short and Digital Underground always come to mind. Even in the Bay Area, people are sleepin on this joint and they shouldn't. Taydatay (of the group 11-5) is one of the best lyricist to come out of the Bay for quite some time now. So if you can get a hold of any 11-5 records off of Dogday records do it now, they have 2 cds already out, and they are off the hook (the song Garcia Vegas has been an undergound hit since it dropped a few years ago). Anyways the few of us who follow him have been waiting for him to go solo. Anticipation is a good album, not great but good and won't letdown any true fan. With tracks like Cutty Bang, Tay flexes his flow. The down side is he seems to come alot stronger on tracks with faster beats and I also think he has way to many guest artists on the album with him. But overall it's a good buy. PEace"
3,ANTICIPATION...YES!!!!!!... WORTH THE WAIT...NOPE,"MAAAAN... Actually I give the album ABOUT four stars. When 11-5 came out it was straight knockin the whole first album I thought was TIGHT same wid the second.And everybody was talkin bout TAYDATAY finna come out wid a solo. People couldnt wait, but when it had came out, I was really disapointed. Sure TAYDATAY could flow (tight) and cuttybang and a few songs were knockin but the overall album wasnt as good in comparasent wid the other two 11-5 albums.I just wasnt feelin the beats in this one...But TAYDATAY is just one of those artists you just have to go check out for yourself cuz he is on of the tightest in the bay!!!! so go check it out and support your bay area rap....YOU SUCKA @SS SELL OUTS!!!"
2,This movie is so 1970,"Worst thing that can happen to an already-bad movie is that it becomes dated, and alas, that's what became of ""BVD"". So we get wooden acting and a howlingly bad script right alongside ""square"", ""groovy"", and bad color reproduction. They tried to work a rock band somewhere into this movie, but it all seems to have gotten lost in the mess of flamboyant scenery-chewing and several women with bubble hair missing their cues.The ""racy"" stuff this film is famous for has not endured the march of time, and even the creepy part at the end (...)is of little shock value in our modern world brimming with ""transgenders"".Lastly, the tacked-on moralizing sequence at the end of the flick effectively nullifies everything that occurs in the movie up to that point, sort of a ""don't try this at home"" band-aid for a Hollywood too cowardly to take a ""chance"" on this release."
5,"Any friend of Mary Wollsencraft Shelley, is a friend of mine","Well, it made me so happy to see that Mike Myers got Russ Myers when he used the famous Z-man line in Austin Powers; ""It's my happening and it freaks me out!"" Not too many people got that reference! but after seeing this film countless times, i have realized how apocalyptic it all is! The Carrie Nation people would be proud.... Try strapping on this movie sometime! But remember, men who wear sandals must not get too many volunteers!"
5,Among the finest films ever produced (although disguised),"This is possibly Meyer's masterpiece, screenplay brilliantly constructed by Roger Ebert. Yes, Roger Ebert. Few will recognize what a truly high work of art this is, though that is its whole essence and furthers its brilliance. It appears to be a B movie exploring the decadent art-scene of early seventies L.A. It is so way over the top it seems almost unbelieveably ridiculous, weaving in cheesy buzz words, and eventually setting up a vast array of stereotypic, melodramatic story lines. Just when it seems to be degenerating to the point where one can see no possible way this can be considered artistic, Meyer creates truly unbelievable shifts that make the movie work. Art is headed in the direction of forcing us to question whether or not it is just junk or genius. Straddling that line for the first and most intriguing time in movie history is Meyer in this unforgettable masterwork in film. -Chris Coffman"
1,Road Apple Plus,"It's been nearly 30 years since I saw this and I had blissfully forgotten it until some recent publicity. The references to it caused terrifying flashbacks and impelled me to commit my impressions to writing. Nonetheless, this one was a classic piece of fresh excrement, and should foreclose the screen writer from his profession as a serious critic. The only parallel I can think of is from the same era, Anthony Newly's regrettable Can Heironymous Merkin . . ., which (thankfully) has never corrupted videotape or disk. If your taste runs to witty skin movies, try Flesh Gordon or something by Al Goldstein instead. Don't submit yourself to this indignity or you'll still be regreting it 30 years from now."
1,What's all the excitement about?,"Boring, stupid, laughable, dated and ridiculous.Why would anyone want to relive the Silly Sixties?And Roger Ebert is now a film critic? Give me a break!I hereby award this disaster *minus* 5 stars."
3,Pam Grier collector,I've finally found it i've been collecting Classic Pam Grier movies for quite a while now so i'll soon be adding this one to my collection. I even have the Roger Corman collection of Pam Grier movies.
3,cute for Halloween,"Soft-core interactive dvd where you (the audience) knocks on the door. A different beautiful woman answers each time and asks you a question. If you answer correctly, she dances/strips for you.I thought the concept was pretty unique and fun, but after about 3 or 4 ""door knocks"" I grew bored with the interactive part. I believe there is an option to bypass that section on the dvd. Some of the wrong answers were funnier than the right ones.A few of the ladies were stunning and quite the seductive little dancers, but there were others who either seemed nervous/camera shy or inexperienced. That kind of ruined it.This dvd is the kind of thing you want to play on an October night with a good group of people....probably during some drunken festivities.Overall I'd give it a 3.5"
1,NOT EVEN ONE STAR!!!!!!!!!!!! SUCKS,"this movie is the worst movie i ever saw ...it s so boring that i keep on sleepin whenever i watch it..99% of the movie is made of some famous people saying..""oh i saw a witch she has blue hair and black eyes and blablabla "" the story of the movie starts at the last 5 min where some people try to proo ve that there is no witch and they get lost then 2 people started sayin to each other u should stop that witch thing the other said i din t do it u did the, other says again not me! then they both look at the one next to them and it s over TO BE CONTINUED......I HATE THAT MOVIE although I DONT REGRET PAYIN EVERY PENNY I SPENT ON THAT MOVIE co whenever i need to sleep i just put that movie and zzzzzzzzzzzzz..........."
4,"If you have a sense of humor, give this one a chance!","If you're looking for serious cinema like some other reviewers on this page, then look elsewhere. But if you want to watch a funny movie with some downright hilarious dialogue, then this is one to check out. This is a rather low budget picture that boasts some seemingly improvised pieces, but it all packs a terrific comedic punch. The cameras seem to be digital hand held, but still provide a nice image. The DVD has some bonus goodies and has a knock out Dolby Digital 5.1 track. Recommended."
5,Magic Brought To Life!,"I was skeptikal when I first received this deck a year ago as a gift from a friend; but the very first time i shuffled it the cards literally came to life in my hands! They have such a presence about them, a life of their own. Very powerful cards!Vibrant colors, images that you can get lost in for hours, and a very alluring energy.I am very possessive of this deck. I only use it to do readings for myself, and to do Tarot Spells with. It's one of the very few i keep just for me! I thought for sure this would be a mediocre deck at best, boy was i wrong!!"
4,Digital Tire Gauge,"Good product and easy to use. But can't tell you about the light, because it never worked. Don't know if it uses a seperate battery that was dead or if the bulb was bad. Either way, as a tire guage it is very good."
4,Lets Make It Legal,"What a delightful movie set in the time when couples still slept in separate single beds. The idea seems ritzy for that time period and so common place now. The cast is excellent. Marilyn Monroe has a very small part. You notice Marilyn and keep thinking about her even after the film is over. I have so enjoyed this movie and I hope you will too, but only if you like the older movies."
5,worth it for the cute Hanson-Roberts deck alone!,"this is a terrific set to get someone as a gift - or for yourself! I love the smaller sized Hanson-Roberts deck - the original deck is smaller than average to begin with, but the one included here is adorable and pocket sized, yet still big enough to use for readings. the book is of course very basic, little more than a ""LWB"" (the little white book included in tarot decks) but worthwhile for a memory jog, and good for beginners. I would certainly get another book to go with the set if you are learning, I recommend Mary Greer's Tarot for Your Self.I think this is a very good value for the price."
5,Just Wonderful,"I got this for a birthday gift two years ago, and though it is a small set, I was and am hugely happy with it, being a (very) long time fan of the original HR deck. I love that you can actually use this deck, it's not just a novelty like the Tiny Universal Waite or anything. I can stick it in my purse, and truly have a Tarot to Go! I love that the handy woman I get Tarot bags from lon eBay had some featured that perfectly fit the larger and smaller HR decks!As others have mentioned, the book that goes along with this set it very basic indeed, but if you already know and love the art in the HR deck, you will certainly be happy just to look at the visual design of the book, which shows the art arranged in many attractive ways. I'd love to know who at Peter Pauper Press came up with the idea of just this deck for the concept, because I would surely like to thank them"
4,Holds air,"A few years ago, I became tired in some current while snorkeling. Learning from that, I bought vests for my wife and me before going on a cruise. They arrive quickly and in use were reasonable comfortable. I never really needed them but did wear them and they worked well adding air or letting air out. I might use rented fins but I use my own mask and snorkel. From now on, I will use my own snorkel vest. If I had it to do over, I would buy them again."
4,Disappointed,"I am a HUGE fan of Kovacevich, but have to admit that I was disappointed by this CD - esp. the ""Appassionata"". I really expected him to ""let loose"" on this most ferocious of sonatas, but instead we get a measured performance that lacks both the dramatic intensity of Gillels, Richter and Horowitz and the rhythmic elan of Kempff."
1,Come See The Worst Album In The History Of Music...,"Whoever should read this beware. This is the worst album I have ever had the displeasure of attempting to listen too. The songs are bad, the words are bad and Don Johnson is just plain bad. Don Johnson should take a hint from this album and just quit his job and go live on a desert island. Why do you think MTV and VH1 have declared they will never show this video again. If your name is Don Johnson and you are reading this I mean no harm, in fact I'm trying to prevent this album from taking millions of innocent lives. Say no to ""Heartbeat,"" just say no."
1,He sure needed Tubbs' help on this one...,"You remember Crockett and Tubbs from Miami Vice. Well, Don ""Crockett"" Johnson tried his luck at recording an album. Thing is, I'm not sure if this even classifies as an album.We have 16 ear bleeders coming at you. And let's get it going...It starts off with the ""hit"" heartbeat. Here are the lyrics:Heartbeat! I'm looking for a Heartbeat!I suggest: Stop Button! I'm looking for the Stop Button!The 3rd track really has me guessing. The Last Sound Love MakesWhat the hell does that mean? I think this album was around the time Melanie Griffith left him for that Zorro guy. Imagine that...She hears him writing this crap and leaves. She didn't leave because of your pastel, she left because of this music you wrote.GREAT SUICIDE MUSIC!"
5,Good product and effective formulation,"When I was diagnosed with a severe manganese deficiency, the dr. said I would feel better quickly after taking Manganese. This is the only brand manganese I tried- specifically wanted chelated for better absorption- and have to say after only 3 days my intense ligament pain was 90% better. Also, this has had noticeable regulating effect on my reactive hypoglycemia. Four months later it is still a regular part of my supplements.The symptoms of overdosing on manganese are very, very scary however, so I would never suggest anyone take this large dosage without medical supervision."
4,Nice bio...,"If you'd like to know more on buddhist masters this is a good video, but don't expect much on buddhist thoughts."
1,Save your money,Google your way to GPSgeek and you'll find a 12v DC power cable for a Garmin GPSMAP 60CS and other compatible units. Price $12.95 plus $4.95 shipping plus sales tax.
3,A loaded gun...,"Accept has always been a band not for the faint at heart;their demolishing guitar attack,complete with a powerful rhytm section and Udo Dirkschneider's vocals propelled them to a cult status among the most rabid metal fans.This 1986 opus marked a twist in the road,where they took a slightly more commercial approach,and yet retained a vigorous sound,e.g.,""T.V.War"",""Heaven is Hell"",""Aiming High"",etc.Without doubt,this is one of their most accomplished works."
2,walk away the pounds,Not what I thought it would be. Very dissappointed. It is all the same as her other videos. Not worth it
2,Incomplete product,"I already had a dvd of ""Leslie Sansome-Walk the Pounds for Abs (Get Up and Get Started/High Calorie Burn.)which included a walk away belt.I wanted another copy. That is why I ordered the copy through Amazon. The dvd that I ordered through Amazon did not have the ""walk away belt."" I sent a email to ""Cherrybooks"" regarding my dissatisfaction and have not received a response. What is the policy regarding incomplete orders?"
3,Overpriced video,"My son is Scooby Doo Crazy and has most of the movies-we thought this movie sounded awesome but when we received it we found it had been way overpriced and not worth the money. If you are looking for older scooby doo movies this one may be for you-although younger scooby doo fans will probably be disappointed with the ""appearances"" scooby doo makes."
5,Excellent ASL Resource,"Random House Webster's American Sign Language Dictionary by Elaine Costello and Lois Lenderman is an excellent resource for anyone interested in learning and using American Sign Language (ASL). Not only do I use it, but recommend it to students at the local college where I serve as an ASL lab instructor. The step-by-step descriptions and memory aids (hints) help the reader understand the nature of the sign and better remember how it is made. The book is published in two sizes, the print type being the only difference. I highly recommend the larger print, but the smaller book is lighter weight and more convenient when transporting between home and school.I highly recommend this to anyone interested in ASL."
2,mistakes,I found a many old signs are wrong and incorrect. Deaf signs are not acceptable and hurt other people feelings. This problem is that this book copied from older unreliable sources without checking with reliable source and culture uses. I thinks it is not helpful book I come across for my learning in sign langauge.
5,Love this book,"I have several asl dictionaries and this is my favorite. It doesn't have a lot of signs kids like, but this one along with the Galludet dictionary gives you what you need. Sometimes the Galludet dictionary pictures are vauge about movement or hand placement, but Random House has full descriptions along with pics.And it's MUCH smaller then Galludet so I'm able to take it places. A must have!"
2,Handel: Messiah (King's College Choir),"I would like to report exactly the same problem ""Bob North"" reported in his review. The named Blu-ray disc is not fully supported by neither my Panasonic blu-ray disc player Model DMP-BD35 nor my Philips BDP5005. My blu-ray disc players do playback the music from the disc but no video pictures are shown. Obviously, this is not the problem of the players (Bob North's Sony or my Panasonic and Philips) but that of the disc that claims to be ""designed for worldwide playback."" It is hoped that the Dutch producer of the disc take note of our problems and submit their response as soon as possible."
5,Reference Quality DVD,"Handel's ""Messiah"" is given the treatment it deserves on this superb DVD. Uniformly excellent performances by King's College Choir, the Brandenburg Consort and soloists are complemented by a stunning 5.1 soundtrack and beautifully rendered video. This is a reference quality DVD. Highly recommended."
1,It Doesn't work,My son bought me this recorder for a father's day gift several years ago. It has never worked! We have tried many times to copy our home videos and the DVD's always come up blank! Took it back to the store and the clerks discovered on blogs that there are a tremendous amount of complaints about this product not working. I can't believe this is a Sony product. Sony should be better than this. I'm planning to mail it to the President of Sony to let him deal with it! Don't buy this product.
1,"DO NOT BUY SONY PRODUCTs, especially this one.","It has a chip which refuses to record a satelite signal (alleged copyright protection) even if the signal is local boredcast, sports, movie channel or pay per view. My sat provider advised me that the problem lies in Sony's copy protection technology, which interferes with their signal. No other company manages to screw with the signal like Sony.translation - DO NOT BUY SONY DVD OR RECORDING PRODUCTS."
4,Fantastic,"The tambourines are beautiful and durable, not to metion priced very well. You could pay much more at other sites for such nice pieces of equippment. Enjoy!"
3,Special and not so special colors,"Dream Schemes is a great collection of special airliners color schemes, and more. Naturally there are ample colorful and often detailed photos of well known and not so well known special-colors aircraft from airlines all over the world. Qantas' ""Wunala Dreaming"" is here, the ""Bird-of-paradice"" Air Niguini Airbus, the Frontier (2) tail-colors, Mexicana's different colors, the many logojets of Ryanair and WestPac, the ""Sommerflyet""-colors of my native Braathens and many more. Great photos, and the text often explains the background of the special colors. Unfortunetly, for some reason the authror has included many photos of aircraft which only have small stickers and text appiled - hardly ""dream schemes"" - space that could've been used for more ""exotoic"" pictures. But, all in all a great adition to the library of any ""airliner-freak"""
1,murda mix tape,this album is totally wakkk mobb deep is the worst rap group in america! the evidence check out the song fourth of july with alchemist he has no buisness even looking at a microphone let alone rapping behind one! in other words alchemist voice sounds awful spoiling the whole songbut thats not all prodigy has lost what little lyrical prowess he once had on their old albums he sounds old and tired on this album the rehashing of old beats with new lyrics makes songs sound old and stale with nothing fresh on the menu avoid this album at any cost!!!
1,T-Mobile Sucks,7 Replacement phones in 3 1/2 months. Wouldn't let me out of contract without the BBB helping. Were JERKS on the phone. Customer service was terrible. Said 1 thing did another.
1,Never again,"Although T Mobile has great phones at great prices, I will never again sign up with them. Fees tacked on for anything you can thing of, and outrageous bills that just add and add and add. HORRIBLE internet connection and horrible service. NEVER AGAIN!@"
1,Amongst the worst books I have ever read!,"Boy oh boy, girl oh girl!! AM I GLAD YOU FIND IT DIFFICULT TO FIND THIS BOOK!"
5,A warm companion for the voyage,"This book was my trusted warm companion for my menopausal journey. At times, I think it was this book that kept me centered and sane during some long nights of insomnia due to hormonal changes.While one can not call a friend during the wee, dark hours of sleeplessness, Marian's book was always there with wisdom words and explanations that let me know that this, too, shall pass.May I heartily commend this book to each woman to gift herself with--and to share or give to friends as they enter this transitional passage of new potential and mystery."
1,Disappointing,"After one third of the book I gave up. Though really interested in the subject, I hadn't found a thing that common sense wouldn't teach me."
5,koolest blues playing,Derek Trucks has proven that there is still room for improvement on the creative platform. He and is super talented band are the best I've heard in a long time. These boys use the full musical palette of colour...it aint just BLUE!!
4,Ok,"It's an interesting album, allthough it is a step down from the fantastic joyful Noise. Derek digs in with the style and sound that is only his. This album is more guitar and less experimentation and is just another chapter in the ongoing Indian Jazz blues saga of Mr. Trucks."
3,When it was new,"Did you ever own Jan Hammer's Oh Yeah! album in vinyl?If you are looking to fill in those spaces in your library with the jazz you had to dispose of when you got rid of your vinyl recordings, this one is a classic.It is the beginning roots of Jan Hammer and had always been a favorite. I had been looking for Oh Yeah! in CD reprint and nowhere to be found. Some of this collection is not up to Jan Hammer's modern skill, but he was 30 years younger at the time. Some of it is worthy of garage band material, but some shows the brilliance which was to come later.When I first purchased Oh Yeah! in 1976, I was looking at a genius. I feel that same emotion listing to this album now!"
4,Great! An opera in English,"I enjoyed watching this opera. I enjoyed it more when I searched for a libretto off the internet. (It has no subtitles.) The words are spoken and sung quickly, and many are not familiar modern English terms. Like many comic operas, it is really rather ridiculous. it is sung and acted well and the costumes are a delight."
2,Confused,"I purchased the series to assist in preparation for the upcoming CIA examinations and must admit the books are very confusing. Ideas are presented in a very disjointed manner and I am unable to determine the main trend or ideas shared after having read a couple of pages.There is also information overload as the ideas do not flow naturally from one to the other, and it takes along time to complete one chapter.The content is good but the explainations are not very clear as to how they all fit together."
3,"Great film, Bad acting","To get started, this happened in Venezuela in 1989 where the now president Hugo Chavez led a military uproar against Carlos Andres Perez. It wasn't a success thanks to him, every other military group took their place all over the country, all except him. It brings with it also live feed from the real thing whitch is what saves the film but the bad part is that the actors are way too cool for what's going on."
1,Look elsewhere for a Bluetooth headset!,"Based on my other Logitech Mobile Freedom (of which 3 have died) I bought this expecting the same performance. Both of the units I got are muffly, so nobody can understand what you are saying (while what you hear is okay). Aside from that, the units disconnect and reconnect about every 2 minutes, making your phone beep and warn you of the disconnect/reconnect status. I ended up throwing mine away at Publix. I now have a Motorola H300 which works much better.Don't expect a good value just because this one is cheap. It is a purely false economy."
1,So weak performance,"this product have so weak performancethere is no clearity in voice, even if i stand or stay in car then also there is no voice clearity...."
1,Don't buy this product!!!!,"I hate this product. The ear bud makes it awkward to use, and it always feels like it is about to fall off my head. If I would have known it had an ear bud, I would not have bought it. You cannot see the ear bud from the angle that the picture is taken. I would not recommend buying this product."
3,LOGITECH bluetooth earphone,"I have 2 units that came with promotinal offer,great fit,but there is one problem sometimes when i receive call the volume goes down itself and will not come up even if you try pressing the correct key,it just reset if turned off.The other still work ok..."
5,Great book on the Farmall Tractor,"This is a must for Farmall lovers. It is well organized with both historical and mechanical information. It is an enjoyable book to sit back with and browse, or it is helpful when information is needed about a specific tractor. I gave it as a gift, and borrow (steal) it every now and then to enjoy myself."
3,Alright for children beginning to play with cars.,My son was entertained with it for a short time (few weeks) and has had nothing to do with it since (3 months ago)
3,OK toy,"I got this for my son when he was 1. It is very easy to put together, and very simple to use, however, it only keeps him entertained for 5 minutes. It also falls apart easy... especially when u have 2 rough boys. The biggest problem is that it ONLY WORKS WITH THE CARS INCLUDED! we have a ton of the little tonka cars, but none of them work on the track. The cars that come with it are much narrower. so, great toy for the money, just a little on the dull side."
2,One of the lamest toys ever,This garnered about zero interest from our 2 year old. He was moving on almost as soon as he placed the three cars and watched them roll away. Move on to something else that does a better job keeping attention and supporting development other than this hunk of plastic.
5,Lena. Julia. -- You Rock!!,"This Dvd is a must for all the fans that respect themselves. I viewed and reviewed this Dvd a lot of times. It shows Lena and Julia Behind the scenes;; their clips [all the things she said(english and russian version); not gonna get us(english and russian version); 30 minutes and how soon is now];; a live performance for MTv and a rehearsal.What I liked the most with the Dvd was the clips ""all the things she said"" and ""not gonna get us"" in the russian version. In fact the clip ""all the things said"" are only edited clips taken form the russian version clip and lip matched to the english version. Same for ""not gonna get"".I freaked when I saw the 2 girls kissing in the rain. It is S-O exciting!! (From my point of view, of course).To crown all, I say that it is a Dvd everyone must see. The girls are so hot. If you appreciate them, you'll see. You Worth It."
2,Uninspiring,"This was the first book I tried of Hemry's and judging by other reviewers, was probably the worst one I could have picked.I kept thinking (and hoping) that there had to be some kind of plot twist but there wasn't and it just plodded along to it's inevitable conclusion.That said, it could have been half as long and twice as good. I just found it a long, hard, read."
5,even our newborn grandson enjoys this video,When I purchased this video I wasn't for sure our newborn grandson would enjoy watching this video. To our surprise even at one month he would watch it for the full 30 minutes. Now I plan on giving it to all my grandchildren and as shower gifts.
5,Great Buy!,Not a well known brand but the watches they make are great. I bought this one as well as another one they make in blue. Love both of them and wear them all the time. The shipping was also very fast - I ordered them on 12/21 and received them on 12/26.
1,Poop,I found Limp Bizkits Poop to be vulgar and (or) offensive. I wouldnot recomend this ... to anyone...
3,Works OK..,"Well, I tried this for the first time and it seems to work ok. However, I find that yes it helps get rid of gas..but now I am burping it up! AND the pills have a horrible smell and taste. YUCK. I could taste the pill as I was burping. I don't have that issue with Tums or Pepcid, but I will keep using it and see how it goes.Mostly I hate the burping.I will review again after a week or so."
2,Mostly Uninteresting,...lower your expectations. The most interesting photo is the cover. This tells you everything.The price is pretty steep for what you get.
5,"If you love asian women, you will love this book!","Asian Ladies, by Ume Ommer is a wonderful book. Ommer has chosen to show asian women in sensual, delightful way and he succeeds in an outstanding fashion."
3,Interesting,"I would give the historical portion of this book five stars, but the Authors religious predictions for the coming year of 2000 missed the mark."
5,Anthems CD,"I just got this CD for my birthday...and Amazon.com was the only place to purchase it!!! I went on an EF Tours trip to Australia in June and was introduced to a song that our bus driver, Matt, played over the speakers....it soon became our favorite request. The song was ""True Blue"". Soon after our trip began, our trip coordinator, Byril, taught us fun motions to a song that became our theme song ""Home Among the Gum Trees"". The clincher was the unashamed emotion brought on by ""Waltzing Matilda (With 100,000 Voices)"" and the pride even we non-Australians felt when that song was played. There is no question that memories of my fabulous Australia trip has a soundtrack with the songs of John Williamson."
2,Where is Ego Trip,"I have been looking for Ego Trip on cd for 10 years. This is a good Blow cd but you could get all these songs, they are just repackaged. Basketball, AJ Scratch, and 8 Million stories were on ego trip and yes they were the hits. But Under Fire and Fallin Back in Love, and I can't take it no more, were all old school masterpieces that should be reissued on cd, ego trip where are you?"
5,Thank you so much!,"I am very pleased with the ink I received at a great price. Because of a delay in mailing, it was cleared up fast and very much to my satisfaction."
2,buy the real albums,"nickelback are good. straight off! however three sided coin is just a collection of songs from their 1st three albums. why dont you just save up a lil bit of money and go and buy them separately! that way you get all of the songs and the better ones. these arent even the good 1s! where o where is good times gone? just get curb, the state and silver side up separately and then why dont u be a rebel (sarcasm) and get the long road too! wow!"
2,About average or a little below for the genre,No real plot or humor. Character development is lacking as well. Not horrid but over all lacking. A Ds theme little MS and some BDSM as well. Most of these scenes are pedestrian but not bad. However; compared to The Marketplace Series by Laura Antoniou it is seriously lacking.
1,junk,"As soon as I saw it, I give it away because it feels and looks like junk. Don't waste your money"
2,Misleading Ad,"I purchased a CMP-485 with 2 Tribars on Amazon.com through Music123. They only sent the CMP-485.I think it is quite disengenuous to advertise but not hold to what was listed.I would suggest that AMAZON.COM should abate any further ads from this company as they are guilty of deceptive practices.BTW, the ad still shows both items as a single product."
3,Thursday,Great movie. However DVD would not play in my Sony DVD player.Would only play on my Pioneer Elite DVD player. Should play on all DVD Players.other then this one issue everything was to my satisfaction.
1,Disappointed,"I bought both of these books and really hoped they would be good. I saw him the day before on TV. Well the books came and I should have returned them because the ingredients are not realisitic. These are not things that I would ever have on hand. All of the recipes are strange, I doubt I will ever cook one thing from them."
5,Eating Stells Style: Low Carb Recipes for Healthy Living,I bought this book for more of the Stella recipes for myself and my family! We love it! It is great!
5,IT WORKS!,Real recipes. Easy. Delicious! His family is proof that there is a better way! Give it a try! You will like it!
3,Nostalga,I became a space cadet reading this series when I was ten years old. I never saw the series or even knew they existed until I stumbled across them on Amazon. It's amazing how little they invested in those days in TV series vs. what they spent on movies.
4,Fun to watch after all these years!,"Wish there were more episodes, but the ones there are good. The sound is weak on a couple, but usable. I had no problem with cutting off part of the picture like one person here. The added features are pretty corny, but fun. Space Angles is one of those with still drawing with human mouths superimposed; sort of like the old Clutch Cargo cartoons. In all, I'm satisfied with this. I was 11 or 12 when Tom Corbett was on TV, and its fun to watch again."
2,Slow story with horrible main character,"I have yet to finish this book mainly because I find myself struggling to continue. I've made a third of the way through the book and I'm still not interested. The mainly character is hihgly unlikeable. Some say this is just like Hades Daughter but I found that I loved that book and that series.If you're looking for an exciting, enjoyable read then don't choose this book. If you want to complete your read of all of Sara Douglass works then pick this up."
2,The history was entertaining...,"The characters were not. I found that I had to think about who Hal and Lancaster were, who Raby was, and that is the kiss of death when I can't even care enough to remember who major characters are. I fought through it and finished, and Margaret's 'hook' may get me to start by skimming the second book, but I doubt I will be able to finish two of these. There is just no meat in this meal, it left me thinking that the author left something out."
4,Sweet story,"Read this book a long time ago when i was a teenager,Perfect for any horse crazy girl, Has good story with good moral about family and sacrifice. I lent my copy out years ago and it never returned. Just seeing the cover brings back long ago memories of reading and dreaming of horses."
5,PS3 Charging Cable,"It looks like the really expensive charging cables but it's not that expensive. Gets the job done. Mostly I have it coiled up and just use it to charge the controller while I'm not playing, but it's really nice to be able to sit on the couch and play when the controller starts going dead."
1,I felt fooled by Brita!,"The ""electronic Filter Change Indicator"" is just a timer that counts down to two months. I thought, and many other customers did too, that it could measure water flow and tell me when the 40 gallon limit was reached!Given the large price markup Brita sets on this product vs. other almost identical pitchers using the simple CalendarMinder, I felt fooled!"
4,Great product!,"Great product. The dispenser is designed well, fits in narrow areas and lid stays on. Easy to handle"
2,Piece of Junk,"This Brita filter is poorly built. The top constantly falls off when I try to poor the water. It doesn't snap in properly. Also, the little flap at the spout gets stuck sometimes and water spills everywhere. I bought a PUR filter now and am more happy with it."
2,Pitcher junk,The pitcher worked fine for the first month after that the lid would not stay on. There is not latch for it to lock into it just sits there with a small plastic peace that kind of clicks in. The water tastes great but the pitcher is junk.
1,Dead Battery,"Brita wants to increase landfill and waste by having you throw away your 5 year-old pitchers because that's how long the battery is supposed to last in the filter replacement timers on these and similar units. My battery ran out and now I have to guess when the filter needs to be replaced. They used to have a ""sticker"" system on the old pitchers which was sustainable and actually better. Companies like this should be held accountable for contributing to waste pollution."
3,A great pick me up,"Learning a language on your own like me? and can't seem to progress? Get off your plateau with this little motivational book. Light on actual info, but it will get you back into your studies."
4,Skill builder!,I have worked for a year now with my tutor in the advanced level and occasionally turn to the grammar companion publication. It is a great enchancer for French vocabulary!
1,Now WITNESS a serious attack on Witness that'll make Witness History!,"STOP HEDGE FUNDS!I'm writing this because I believe that this Hopkins character isn't the person he claims he is , nor this mrs. Linda Cortile."
4,read this book years ago,"I read this book a long time ago and loved it. Even to this day I remember it, which to me is amazing in itself. This is definitely a must read on the subject of alien abductions. Too bad it doesn't come in a kindle edition."
2,Cheaply made leather sheath. Doesn't hold up.,"My original review said this was great. Well, a couple of months later, I've changed my mind. Sure, it holds and protects the knife just fine, but the sheath itself simply doesn't hold up. Very disappointing for a Victoninox product.First, the cheap rivet on the belt loop popped out. In doing so, it ripped (yes, Ripped) the leather.Next, the stitching on the sheath has started to come undone.I'm still using it, but I'm in the market for a new sheath. Going to have to replace this at some point."
3,Hurricane in the Rose Garden,"This movie was ok. It was low budget and, reminded me of an Nigerian movie. Overall, I would probably not have purchased it because the story line was not very developed and, the acting was not very good. Except for Tanji Miller, the rest of the actors seemed unprofessional. Overall it was a 3. It was definitely not worth more than the few dollars I paid."
4,Good backboard - good value.,"I bought this for my 10 year old son on his birthday. He loves it. It took a little work to get together (pictures could be a bit bitter) but if you take your time and FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS it should go together OK. However, you will need help - there is no way that one person can hold a 10 foot pole while trying to attach the adjustable backboard mechanism. The end result is a sturdy backboard that can actually be moved on blacktop by one adult."
3,"""Town & Country"" Not Out to Pasture","While this movie isn't as bad as its reviews, it was lacking in some areas. The characterization was pretty good...but the storyline dragged on and didn't really seem to be going anywhere. And I'm not sure it actually did. On the positive side, Goldie Hawn was wonderful as usual and more attention should have been paid to her as a comedy great. Although a weird subplot, I thought Andie McDowell and her family to be a rare treat. Although it was her psychotic father played by Charlton Heston that was given more screen time, her mother--suffering from a rampant wheelchair and the mouth of a sailor--was the standout and should have been used more for comedic purposes. She was the highlight of the movie!"
2,dissapointed,I purchased several Steinhausen watches and this one in partiucular the crystal easyly broke. also the italian fake leather would fall the pin having an opportunity to loose your watch.Does not support the money you pay for it.I would NOT recommend this watch.
2,Why must they edit it so much?,"Okay before I give my reasons for NOT liking this I must tell I have seen the WHOLE Japanese series of Dragonball Z. Therefore I know what was cutout and cleaned. Number 1-I Still dislike the voices, they all sound like cheesy Warner Bros. characters ESPECIALLY Goku. Numer 2-They cut out any sighns of nudity(believe me there's a lot of Goku NAKED in the Dragonball) Also cut out are the actual HITS of the fighting, Example-when the little green guy from the Ginyu force is beating Krillin and Gohan those puffy clouds are NOT supposed to be there! 3-The mispronounce and change everything! Example Goku's Kamehameha is said ""Ka may-ha-may-ha"" not Ka maya maya! Also for those of you that care Piccolo's signature attack is not called ""Special Beam Cannon"" It actually is Hell's Light. All in all it's not that bad but if you can get the Japanese episodes get them instead. You caN STILL UNDERSTAND THE EPISODES AND THEY'RE MUCH BETTER! Trust me!"
3,It's great but there's too much editing.,"There's way too much editing in the American version. I would give it five stars, but because of the editing I didn't."
4,A Great Help for Frustrated Gamers,"I bought this guide last week after I was thoroughly stumped on how to get at some of those cages in the beginning. The book is divided into sections, each one telling you what you have to do to get through each world. I found one discrepancythere was no cage dangling at the end of the pier in the Sanctuary of Water and Ice. I haven't played the whole game through yet, but so far this guide has helped me a great deal."
4,Wonderful,"Love Athur, and love this movie. I am so glad I added it to my collection of Holiday favorites."
1,Not that good,I was very displeased with this software. It is almost like you have to already know spanish to understand it. It does not even teach you the alphabet. I would only recommend this to someone who has an understanding of the language already.
2,Returned it,The watch was good looking but too heavy and the date dials were impossible to read. Watch was returned.
2,At Least It's Better Than Lap of Luxury!,"But that's about all you can recommend on this one, a late/mid-eighties offering from the Tricksters that showed the group struggling for new ideas. Any new ideas. They wound up going the new wave/techno front with a heavy (over) reliance on synthesizers. Still, you can't exactly say the album is boring. Actually, it's more strange than anything. But at least at this point CT was still writing (for the most part) their own material, and Rick Neilsen's typically oddball sense of humor lyrically is well evidenced here. That aside, the bottom line is that there is one good song on this entire album, the undeniably catchy ""Kiss Me Red"". It was, however, written by outside forces...a factor that would lead to their commercial rebirth (and artistic downfall) in the album to follow."
5,Love them!,I absolutely love these cards! They are so beautiful. They have a nice description on the back of each card giving you some info on the each deity.
1,THE PULLEY WON'T WORK/SPIN,"WILL NOT SPIN ,THE OEM WASHER/GARD NEEDS THREE WASHERS BEHIND IT SO IT DOESN'T RUB THE PULLEY.I GOT IT TO WORK BUT NOW THE BOLT (THE ONE THAT HOLDS THE PULLEY ON THE CAR) IS ABOUT 1/4""LESS THREADED IN THEN IT WAS BEFORE."
2,Believe that it's BIG! UPDATE: No Longer Working,"Understand that when reviewers say this is big, they mean it. The picture on amazon reads very flat. This watch face really shines and the color is very rich looking. It's not the easiest thing to read in the beginning, but once you get used to it, it's fine. It truly is a handsome piece.UPDATE: I purchased this watch in 2008, it was used very, very gently and now is no longer working in March of 2010. I'm disappointed that with all the hubbub about Invicta watches' quality, I should now be holding a bum example and will have to deal with getting it fixed."
5,Amazing Quartz,"My new Lupah arrived last week, and it is just an amazing quartz timepiece. The strap is very crisp, everything has a solid construction, and the chronograph features work well. While not a $5000 automatic, it really does get the job done."
3,Standard super assassin babe,"Nicely done, art that rises past mere competence (was there homage to Druillet?), story that moves well. Somehow, though, the whole never added up to the sum of the parts.And, I just have to imagine some high-perfance fiber (kevlar, maybe, or nanotube composite) in her underpants, since A) they feature so prominently under her less-than-buttwidth skirts and since her bounciness and B) her athletics must strain them so terribly. Really, just a bit too much compliance with the babe standard. Fun as a story, but makes a long trip of the return to reality.-- wiredweird"
4,Love the art! Interesting Story arc!,"If you're a big fan of Heavy Metal Magazine, Sci-fi, Fantasy etc. you'll love this book. David finch art is great, you can see references from Blade Runner, Star Trek, even a little bit of Aliens and Star Wars, and Aphrodite is really, really hot so the art deserves a big ten. The story is you're basic origin of the character arc, but leaves you wanting more, still entertaining though.I would buy this more for it's art and concept, but i need to see a better Aphrodite IX story that'll blow my mind.Buy it, it's worth your money, and IX is freaking hot!!!"
2,"OK, but doesn't quite do what one would hope","It's true you can use this to plug in your iPod to your Toyota, but it's not as easy as ""plug it in and have it work"".The process is more like this:1) Plug in your iPHoneNOTE: it will start playing the first song alphabetically in your first playlist alphabetically2) click ""OK"" to the ""this device not made to work with this version of the iPhone"" message on your iPhone.3) change your car stereo to CD 84) Select your song/playlist on your iPhoneYAY it finally works.You *do* gain the ability to skip tracks with your steering wheel and you only have one jack to plug your phone in for charging, which is also audio out, but for shorter trips because of all the steps I find it easier to just use the AUX jack and a car charger.ALSO if you have an iPhone 4 you MUST Dremil/file down your bumper otherwise the really fat jack won't plug into your iPhone."
4,Don't Run From This One,"The U.S. has become a totalitarian society. Justice is gone and law is served with an iron fist. Ben Richards (Arnie) tries to prevent a massacre and instead is blamed for it through media manipulation. After being recaptured from a prison break Richards is pressured to appear on the top rated TV show, Running Man. Richards has to fight his way through the labyrinth while fighting stalkers and helping an underground resistance group."
2,For the idea of this story read the book,"This movie is a typical Arnold 80's flick. Bad acting, loads of action, and God awful one-liners that you have to crack a smile at. This film does do a major injustice to the story that was original written by Rich Bachman/Stephen King. The book was far more a better story to be told. Ben Richards was no wrongly convicted criminal but a desperate man trying to save his family, a sick and dying child and a wife who sells who body so the family can have money. The story goes way more into the corruption of the government and Ben Richards adventure is breathtaking while Arnold's Ben is just boring and predictable. If you are interested in this idea for a story don't waste time with the film, it shouldn't even use the same title as the book because they are only two things that both have. A main character named Ben Richards and a corrupt government controlled gameshow that kills the contestants. Read the book, skip the movie."
3,Arnie runs for his life,"This overly predictable sci-fi/action yarn (based on a story by Stephen King which he wrote under the pen name Richard Bachman) stars good 'ol Arnie as a wrongfully accused man forced to fight for his life on a TV game show in the year 2017. Former Family Feud game show host Richard Dawson is great as the slimy evil game show host, and the rest of the cast includes Maria Conchita Alonso (as a love interest who believes Arnie's innocence), the late Yapphet Kotto (as one of Arnie's pals), and Governor Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura. The Running Man is action packed and is a solid, albeit cheesy, Arnie extravaganza, but if your looking for some of Arnold's better films your better off checking out Total Recall, Predator, or either Terminator film."
2,ANOTHER STEPHEN KING FILM THAT DOES NOT TRANSLATE TO SCREEN,"Enjoyable, but hardly worthy of any accolades as a great sci-fi/fantasy film. Remember, there's more to a film than mere ONE LINERS and F/X. The only plus to this movie was RICHARD DAWSON (former FAMILY FEUD host). Quite a contrast from his lovable self on that show. Thus being the perfect candidate for this evil role. Otherwise, one is better off sticking to the novel. Incidentally, PAUL MICHAEL GLASER (director) is the same former ACTOR who starred as STARSKY in TV's ""STARSKY & HUTCH."""
2,PDA stylus pen combo,The stylus for this pen has been great. However the ink on the black and red pens often skips/gets stuck while writing. Probably won't buy this product again.
3,Not for extra cold days,Used this mask skiing in December in Korea; good on moderately cold days but would condensate on the real cold days and freeze to my face. Nice novelty but get something different for the slopes.
3,confused,The mask is great and it was a great price for it..... The mask itself I would have rated it a 5 but the company with how long it took to mail and how much -for how long- was ridiculous !! If I had gone to the post office and paid that price for it it would have been next day delivery!!
3,its ok,Mask is ok! Doesn't fit me right. My mouth goes to where the nose on the mask is. Will keep you worm though.
5,From the Board Games Editor at BellaOnline.com,"This is really just a collection of very easy sudoku puzzles; it's not ONLY for kids, beginning puzzlers might like it as well. The instructions given are clear-cut and easy to understand, and the puzzles are nicely made, though very easy.It's also a reasonable price for 100 puzzles. This book would make a great stocking stuffer, and will allow your kids to see what all the fuss is about while brushing up on their logic skills.The recommended age here is 9 and up, but I think many clever 7 and 8-year-olds will be able to enjoy these puzzles as well."
2,Water fitness trainer,"I spend around twenty five hours a week in the pool as a water fitness instructor. My workout is designed around the water fan paddles. I know how long they will last and the weak spots on the paddles. If you have had an increase in sales in Tennessee it is from my work. I have a broad following that uses the paddles. I would like to see some changes, if you are willing to listen. Thanks for your time.Willie TownsendPower Water Golf"
1,BUYER BEWARE,"NOT AS PICTURED---ordered this item as a SET,--- Add says ""PADDLES"" (ie one for each hand) received only one paddle.Contacted Amazon but it was completely beyond them to send the other paddle-- the only option was to return it, with no guarantee that a reorder would yield 2 paddles!Don't waste your time. ( Item Description should be rewritten to specify ONE PADDLE -- not-- PADDLES)I agree with previous poster who also rec'd ONE paddle-- don't waste the postage"
5,Delightful story for wintertime,This is the short tale of Sam who his mother has discovered has a cough. Sam's mama patiently negotiates getting Sam to take his bad tasting cough syrup from the too big spoon. Then they snuggle in and wait for the snow to come. This a great story to read to your kids quietly before snuggling into bed on a cold winter night.
4,I like!,Cisco Press is funny because some of their books series are error-few and others are error-some. I really liked the content of this book though. I reference it for specific subjects as much or more than any other good book I own. I wish that it would give better descriptions of more detail on some key commands and not just the cut and paste of the command in the description field. Other than that there is a broad range of decent security info.
3,Long overdue look at early screen icon,"Though by no means ground breaking, this is an overdue re-examination of what is described as Hollywood's first sex symbol. With a personal history more complex and tragic than better known icons ranging from Marilyn Monroe to Jean Harlow, it is amazing that Bow is not better remembered.The narration by Courtney Love, who no doubt shares more than a few things in common with the subjet, is worth noting. She brings real emotion to the voice over without going over the top."
5,Rocío grandifica con su voz todo lo que canta,Este es un nuevo ejemplo de la calidad interpretativa y la belleza tanto física como espiritual de La Dúrcal. El espectáculo de Rocío le da un brillo inigualable a cualquier show. Juan Gabriel debe agradecer poder contar con Rocío como compañera para las actuaciones. Ella brilla con inigualable esplendor.
1,Not exciting,Would have liked more information on relationships with other celebs. Boring. I couldn't read it all. Ok ok ok ok
3,Why we all have to grow up sooner or later or die.,"Picked this one totally out of curiousity, it didn't let me down from that aspect. He's in the pack with, Johnny Rotten and the Plasmatics. If we all get 15min of fame, this group gets the hook after 14 1/2."
4,"Good reading, if you can stomach it","This not very happy, it's not written to make you think Manson is a good person. His childhood wasn't happy and it won't really end on a note that provides closure. Much like his music the movie can provide you with some pretty intense imagery, but after the shock value of some of his statements has worn off your left with someone who is pretty insightful about himself and others and you realize how much deeper the rabbit hole goes.I listen to some of Manson's music but not a lot of it, I had to read this book for a college and it was enlightening and I think I like Manson so much more now then I did before, if for no other reason then this book makes you understand how much his music really means to him. Is he a good person? No. Does he know that? Yes. I think this book gives you a good look at what goes on in the minds of some of the people society has tried to disassociate from as much as possible and I don't think that is ever a bad thing."
3,Hmmm....this was very different,This book was.....disturbing...but brilliant. I'm not a fan of Manson's but I must say he's a descriptive and interesting writer.This book is good for anyone who wants to hear the work of an off beat genius....and has a strong stomach.
4,This book is amazing.,"One little comment to the reader from Rockville: What do you mean doesn't believe in God but worships the devil? Brian Warner said straightforward on page 164, ""What nearly everybody in my life-from John Crowell to Ms. Price-had misunderstood about Satanism was that is not about ritual sacrifices, digging up graves and worshipping the devil. The devil doesn't exist. Satanism is about worshipping yourself, because you're responsible for your own good and evil.""This is a phenomenal book, and even though Manson has messed up being a musician and the meaning of ""goth"", I would recommend this to anyone who knows how to read. I believe in Christ, and doubt many of Manson's words but he still is an intelligent person with a life worth telling of. The only flaw in this book is the lack of a real ending due to the journal entries in the last few pages."
4,Marilyn Manson is amazingly honest.,"This book is amazing for it's brutal honesty. You read the first chapter and as you get into it you notice that Marilyn Manson is not a fake, because, in this book, he writes things that no-one in the world would want to lie about. He also does it with literary style, which really shows his honesty. The only chapter which slides away from this honesty is ""We're Off To See The Wizard"" which was a very well-written chapter anyways, so that criticism really doesn't count. Marilyn Manson wrote a fabulous book."
4,An eye opener,I must admit I was not a big fan of Marilyn Manson what so ever till I read this book. A close friend of mine begged me to give this book a chance and I'm glad I did. For a man who has lived such a complex and rocky life I am truly inspired by his ability to forge through the s*** life happens to throw at you at times.This book gives you a much better perspective of the man they call Marilyn Manson. I found the book enlightening and even enjoyed it enough to purchase it for my niece for Christmas who is a big fan of his.
3,"Somewhat disturbing, but eye opening.","Marilyn Manson is, to me, an interesting character. I got this book to get to know him better and I sure did. This is not for sissies this book and is really almost a tell all. Marilyn speaks about himself, his life growing up and some of the more famous and infamous on the rock scene. A decent read."
3,Interesting if you are into the genre,It is well written if you are into the this scene or genre of music. Others might find it a bit over the top and not as enjoyable.
5,Very absorbing and funny account of Manson's life,"If you ever wanted to know more about the man behind the glam, this is the book for you. Without the bs of an unauthorized biography, you can get a feel for brian warner through his own words. written with help in a very zippy and conversational style, it is hard to put down. you just want to know what he is going to say or do next. I read it in one sitting."
2,Disappointing,"Although not a huge fan of Manson, thought the book would be much better. Seemed just a clinched rock star book. Nothing earth shattering here. Not terrible, but nothing great either. Read my share of music biographies and autobiographies, not all if the subjects was I a fan, this was just okay, if you are a fan you will most likely enjoy it."
2,and Why Not?,"I was curious to know his story, I didnt get much interesting views from him but I am still finding that his purpose is to shock people and blame everything on religion!"
5,The Boy You Loved Is Now The Man You Fear!,This is my third copy of this book that i have purchased if that tells you anything. ive read it 3 times each time learning a little more about this genious. The highly intellectual but highly misunderstood man is revealed. amazing book unless your a closed minded christian! happy reading.Blessed Be!
3,For a man who says he worships intelligence.....,"he sure does not seem very intelligent. He claims that Satanism is about everyone being their own god and the worship of intelligence. If intelligence is blacking out from drug overdoses, sucking other men's penises, and frying a whole in your head with cocaine than I'm just not sure I want to be ""intelligent"". His claims of hating hypocrisy puts him in the same boat with every hypocrite that has ever lived by putting down all these rules of what it means to be an addict and a homosexual and then saying he is neither while breaking all of his rules throughout the same book. The only thing that partially saved this book was some good writing. Other than that, it just confirmed for me how ""unintelligent"" Brian Warner really is."
5,LONG HARD ROAD,"I bought this book when it first came out. I listened to Mansons music before this book came out and wondered why he was so screwed up. After I was finished I could see why. I was so drawn in by this book that I could not put down. For the people who do not like Manson or the people who don't understand him, you should read this book and you will know what he is about and what rumors are and are not true."
4,Interesting Read,"This book was definitely an interesting read, and provided a good deal of insight into the man behind the rock star persona. It balances humor, wit, intelligence, and things that just plain make your stomach churn very well. The only thing I didn't particularly care for didn't necessarily have to do with the book itself-- it's just been my opinion and experience that Manson tends to embellish: not just on his stage persona, but on almost anything with which he regales those willing to listen to him. It seemed to me that that was also the case in this book. Sure, it was an entertaining read, but it leaves me wondering how much of it is actual ""autobiography"" and how much of it is ""fiction."" Regardless, I doubt that you'll find this book boring, so if you're looking for something new, give this a try."
5,Really makes you think,"It's not often I read a book that truly makes me think and consider the thought process of someone else. I found this book enlightening and sometimes comical. Marilyn Manson, while often appearing to live deep in his mind, still has the ability to see the big picture and the humility to laugh at himself at the same time. This book proves to me that honesty and frankness is more appreciated than a candy coated image."
3,Good if you're only interested in rock bios,"I guess I was expecting more out of this even though it was a good read. It covers his childhood very well and does and OK job with his music experiences/friendships/loves etc. But I guess I would have enjoyed a closer look as to where this guy really comes from in terms of why his music is like it is and where he sees himself in the realm of ""pop"" icons. Didn't happen for me but worthwhile reading anyway."
1,A footnote to history,"Well, we finally know the identity of Deep Throat as W. Mark Felt came out of the closet yesterday and quelled the ""Who Is He/She?"", game. Therefore, this book is now completely outdated, irrelevant, and not worth the effort. This book was a wasted effort from the beginning, however, now it is not even worth the paper it is printed on."
1,*Yawn*,"Look, you don't know who ""Depp Throat"" is, I don't know who he/she is and Garment dosen't know either. Only Woodward, Bernstien, Ben Bradlee and ""Deep Throat"" him/herself does. No point in devoting hours to pondering a question that won't be answerd untill ""DP"" dies. This book is a waste of paper.UPDATE: Well, we all know who it was now, so I guess this book has become rather pointless. DP didn't die, but he finally ""came out"" so to speak. Like I said before, we all just had to wait."
1,Ridiculously Tiny,"I had no idea this ornament was so small. Its cute, but when I gave it to my mother as a stocking stuffer, she laughed and asked for her magnifying glass to look at it. From the photo I assumed it was a regular sized ornament, not less than one inch big. If there were dimensions noted, I missed them. Disappointed."
5,PP Man's #1 Fan,"Truly a magical debut work of art that is so diverse in its musical & lyrical content. Little bit of George Michael-ish, little bit of Maxwell-ish, this CD's got it all. It'll make you jump, dance, cry, laugh, smile - but most of all, you'll come ALIVE!!! I can't wait to hear more from this new & raw talent."
4,"""Strange"" Summer Of Granny!","Maybe this should be the title of this book! Because there are a lot of really ""strange"" things going on.A young girl, Jadie, idolizes her granny, and loves nothing more than roaming the deep woods with her, learning all there is to know about the mysterious forest. And she's even suspected of having Granny's ""gift.""But is Granny using her gift for the good or for the bad? It would break Jadie's heart to learn that Granny was up to ""no good"" with her trips out into the dark nights when she thought everybody was asleep. And everybody was asleep... except Jadie, who kept following Granny.And what was that strange smelling black cat that was sometimes seen with Granny? Was it real, or was it just the memory of another cat from Granny's childhood?"
3,You won't see this bad boy on everyone else's arm...,"As others have said, this is a big, big watch--the crystal, too, is large and protrudes outward. The face is very interesting and artistic, and would probably be a hassle to wear with long sleeves. It is also, a heavy sucker. That having been said, it is a show stopper and definitely a one of a kind watch for somebody looking for something that is unique."
3,A wonderfully designed watch but poor build quality,"A wonderful watch to look at, very comfortable on the wrist, which is surprising given the thin wrists I have. Everything with the watch was fine for the first few days however after a couple days the three time adjustment knobs became very loose and the little black rubber rings split... very disappointing.The watch is great in terms of its looks and heft, however the poor build quality leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
3,Not for Younger Children,"I ordered this book to start teaching my two year old daughter sign language, as a way to communicate better. It would be great for older children, and definitley not for beginners, but I didn't like it for me. I felt it was too breif in each section, I wanted more specifics. I felt like the colors and photos of the children doing the signs was distracting and confusing. I would like it more straight forward and to the point."
3,light hearted treatment of Y2K subject,A lighthearted book on a serious subject. The title is cute and non-threatening and this makes it great to give to friends whom you are trying to convince to prepare for possible Y2K problems.
5,A Review of Wes Dando's Album - THE TIRED HOURS,"Not one guy, but a trio of gentlemen from Seattle who gel together some of the prettiest and technical sounds with an almost quirky resonance. Not just another indie rock outfit, this band writes sincere and personal tunes with heart, meaning, and soul. Their debut, THE TIRED HOURS, showcases the brilliance of their sound. A quality in music that has been attempted, but not too often perfected, Wes Dando's effort is a success. It's available from Paste Music. Recommended Songs: ""Coughing Is Contagious,"" ""As Bravery Crumbles,"" and ""My Confidence, Your Opinion."""
3,Didn't keep attention for long,We just go this in the mail a couple of days ago. I was VERY excited to open it and show it to my two year old son. He played with it for about 5 minutes and lost interest. Hopefully he want to use it more as he sees it in the house. It was easy for him to pick up the pegs and begin using it. Didn't need much help!
2,What a disappointment!,"I was so excited for my 2 year old to get this toy, given the other positive reviews, but it seems my experience was quite different than the others. It is supposed to come with 16 large pegboard cards - we only got 8. On top of that, the cards don't even stay properly in back of the screen. They fall off quite easily. I'm suprised at such a poor design, for such a high priced item. You would think they would design a more sensible screen that the cards slip down in the middle or something..."
3,Should be standard issue,"not much to say about a cable, except Garmin should include this with the fishfinder. . . the cable works, is easy to use, and is necessary if you want to use a transducer other than the supplied transom-mount transducer (Garmin doesn't tell you this until you have the unit and you're about to install)"
2,Future One Hit Wonder,"I Recieved this CD as a gift for Christmas about 2 Years ago, Thank God, And i would have to write this group down as a future one hit wonder, ot two hit wonder, the only two good songs are the original Supersexworld, and Another miracle, and even supersexworld, is getting annoying now, i don't think muchmusic did Another Miracle enough justice by not playing it enough, its not that i didn't give the CD a chance, i listened to it alot to try and turn myself on to it(no pun intended) but its just so hard to like something that i couldn't bear listening to, its torture, i'd rather watch Gigli then listen to some distarous songs like My heart belongs to Daddy, and Paper Thin, the sad thing is most songs are at least 4 minutes, i recommend you don't buy this CD, it'll save you your 20$"
4,Sting - Brand New Day concert,"I had seen excerpts of this concert on YouTube, which I enjoyed. So I decided to purchase the DVD. I am really glad I did. It is a great concert by Sting and his band. I also like the bonus material. I enjoy knowing something about their process. I highly recommend this DVD for those who like Sting's music."
1,I should have paid attention to the reviews!,"Who recorded sound during this performance and who approved the quality to have sold it as a CD/DVD Dolby Digital?? Sad to say, but my ten year old son could have done a better job with his Canon L1 Hi8 video - recording in Stereo. I'm disssapointed and embarrased, because before I ordered the DVD, I read several of the unfavorable reviews, but did not believe them. Concert is not a video and/or a sound experience, unless you like to play with your remote's volume control. By the tone of this review, you probably think I don't like Sting, but it is the only Concert DVD I own."
3,"Great DVD, but not the entire show","Great DVD. Great Concert. But why is this limited to 90 minutes, and cut some really great songs like ""Roxanne"", ""When the World..."", and ""If I Ever Lose my Faith in You"" which was played in the concert. I hope that Sting / EMI releases a DVD with the entire concert, there is plenty of room on the DVD to do it!!"
2,"NO, YOU'RE NOT HEARING THINGS! THE SOUND IS TERRIBLE!","What a relief to log in to Amazon and find out that my hearing is not going completely whacko! As a huge Sting fan, I am still going through the grieving process after taking back two copies of this DVD to my local music store, and giving up! Whatever the technical reasons are for poor sound distribution on this disc, all I can tell you is that there is a very good chance the sound falls far below any DVD concert recording I've ever heard. The sound becomes muffled when Sting sings, the crowd fades in and out, just a poor listening experience all the way around. If EMI ever fixes this problem, give me a call!"
1,horrible sound,"The camera always fixes sting even when his musicians play solos.The sound makes it the worst of my concert dvds.Like mono, no atmosphere,only stings voice in the front.I had to check my surround system,because first I thought it`s broken. Save your money!!!"
1,SAD SOUND,I can only agre with other people rating this.....The sound is disepering up and down all the time...Dolby Digital/Stereo it dont matter...very very sad.....sorry for my bad English....
1,I wish I could rate this lower than 1-star,"If the issue of this Malco fiber cement siding gauge being made of flexible plastic wasn't annoying enough, it has another more serious design flaw:This gauge fails at it's most basic function...measuring an accurate exposure. When the gauge is SET for a 7 inch exposure, the ACTUAL exposure is 7 1/16 inch. This can be verified by measuring the gauge with a tape measure.Although 1/16 of an inch may not seem like much, after 16 rows, the cumulative error is 1 inch."
3,Disappointed Mother,"I was very impressed by the great reviews on Baby Annabell, sot I decided to buy her for my 3yo daughter. I had never seen her ""in person"", but she looked cute as a button on the computer screen. As we opened the package, my first impression was: she's so small and ""orange-ish""! When I picked her up I realized my mistake: her extremely floppy arms and under-stuffed body (not cuddly at all) nearly killed me. I was expecting this soft, hugable baby and got this raggedy-ann kind of doll! Everytime I hold her I think her arms will fall apart... Her funtions are sweet and work perfectly.I would say: try it before you buy it. Go to a store and pick the doll up, check her out and then make your decision..."
4,what about hispanic or latino version?,"As for the comment that Zapf never leaves a kid out, what about those kids who are of latino heritage? I've looked everywhere and they only have either caucasion or african american (listed as ethnic) I would really like one for my daughter. I just wish they had a hispanic version."
3,Does not perform as described,"This doll is very cute, and makes cute sounds, but has a few flaws that make her not worth the money. First of all, she does not drink her bottle as described. She will make the sucking motion when the bottle is forced into her mouth, but my daughter cannot push hard enough to get it all the way in. Once the bottle is in her mouth, she doesn't drink it at all. You have to squeeze it very hard and even that takes over an hour to empty the bottle. We have yet to see any tears. When ever the doll is tipped or burped, water leaks out of her eyes. The doll does not respond to touch at all except for waking up if you press on her tummy. She does not respond to sound what-so-ever. The comercial shows that loud noises wake her up and make her cry, but she doesn't.Overall, she is a cute doll, but not worth the $40 she sells for. She is no better than the $20 dolls in the rest of the store."
4,Clara Bow shines in this movie,"Until I saw this film recently, I never thought I would be able to sit through a silent film. I had read about Clara Bow, and was interested to see how she performed on screen. Although it is silent, her personality and vivaciousness shines. Her eyes just have so much expression...The other actors are fine and the story line is all right, but Clara just takes this film and runs with it. No wonder that she became the It Girl upon the release of this movie!Clara Bow was and is truly a film legend and deserves much more notice than she has received. What a wonderful film - worth watching again and again!"
3,Lavishly Illustrated Introduction to Japanese History,"Chock full of feudal Japanese paintings and photographs, this volume of What Life Is Like is a pleasing additon to any library. The series title is somewhat misleading; this is not a look at every day life in feudal Japan. Rather, the text reads exactly like a high school text book: not dumbed down, but not terribly in-depth, either. We are given a rough summary of the politics of Japan from about 1000 to about 1700, with a few pages dedicated to each of the founders of the various ""dynasties"" (my word) to control Japan, including Michinaga, Takauji, and Ieyasu (better known to the American public as James Clavell's Toranaga). Those looking for a rough outline of Japanese history would be well-served to get this one."
5,Good Read,"We enjoyed this book very much. It contained interesting questions to think about, interesting core belief concepts, and interesting character virtue building accounts."
1,Ancient American History?,"I loved this book growing up in the LDS church. Reading it as an adult, however, I came to realize that it is not a true history of the settling of the Americas. The book describes migrations to the Americas by people from the Tower of Babel and ancient Hebrews--claims that are contradicted by DNA studies, archaeology, and linguistics. It treats the confounding of the languages at the Tower of Babel as literal history, and is full of anachronisms that easily prove it to be a work of fiction based on 19th Century ideas about native Americans. For example, there are references to iron, steel, brass, metal pieces of money, wheat, horses, chariots, and elephants in an ancient American setting (approximately 2,400 BC to 400 AD) which are consistent with 19th Century rumors and theories, but simply do not fit within the catalog of scientific knowledge available today."
3,worth the read,"History of the 150-year-old Trappist Monastery in Kentucky, just 40 miles south of Louisville. Made world-famous by its most famous monk, Thomas Merton, who died in Bangkok. Full of archival pictures. Beautiful, coffee table type book, but not too well-written. Confusing at times. Aprile tended to not always be cohesive; she rather jumped around a lot. Am so sorry they did away with the farm. Poignant remark by its current abbot, that the celibate life needs something to care for. It did propell me to spend a week there last summer, and what a wonderful place it is. I need not worry about its survival; you must call four months in advance to go there on retreat."
1,memeo backup is worthless,Got this free trial for 30 days with a WD 500 g drive-takes forever to backup files and trashes them when the trial is over -locks up your computer--Do not buy this product- Trash!
1,"""Free Trial"" Costing Me $165 in repairs","This software came on the Western Digital MyBook 500GB external storage drive I purchased at Target. The first time I used the drive, I ignored this software and 'dragged and dropped' important files onto the external drive. The second time, I *stupidly* thought, ""Well, its included and it sounds great, let's give it a try"". HUGE HUGE HUGE mistake.It was supposed to migrate photos, Office docs and media files - instead it tried to move Program Files, corrupted a bunch of .dlls and now *all* my Programs are toast. In addition, it erased the earlier 'drag and drop' backup I had made on my own. The photos I was trying to backup were all our baby photos, so these were obviously hugely important to me. I am having a trusted local tech company retrieve files for $165 (if I'm lucky). I can only hope the baby photos are ok - I am basically writing off a $1500 laptop because of this program.DO NOT BUY."
2,Not a bad documentary - but not as interesting as I had hoped,"The description of this is misleading. They call it a ""memorial"" and say on the box, ""Join Kirk Douglas, Jack Lemmon, Ted Kennedy, Don Rickles, Milton Berle, Tony Curtis, Gregory Peck, etc. as they pay tribute to the man with the voice of gold."" The above named people are seen for a second each, at Sinatra's funeral. I thought there would be comments from them - nope - just a glimse of them attending the funeral. The actual comments from others are interesing enough, but it's all a bit superficial. An entertaining documentary, but superficial."
3,How many times can you experience an hurricane?,"Nowadays Colossamite is dead. It was quick and foolish. Ferocious. The former singer of Dazzling Killmen (Nick Sakes) and three twenty something pals (that now are Gorge Trio) are always smiling and they try to seem harmless in all the photo I have seen. But don't trust them. They are the ideal soundtrack of an hurricane destroying your house and you are in the eye of this hurricane they can fall in a state of apathy. The tiring chaos, the entropy spreading out from Colossamite is not the cheap mess of noisy incompetents (they can really play!) nor highbrow-Skingraft-stuff (they remember they once have heard some song). But how many time can you experience this without getting used?"
2,The many repeated scenes significantly reduce the quality,"While the narration on these tapes is very good and historically accurate, the video footage approaches the absurd. The action scenes are cut from silent movies about the American Civil War and some of the scenes are repeated many times. As is the case with the silent era, the physical movements of emotion are exaggerated and the film is often grainy.Photos of the principal politicians, battle scenes and military leaders are included as references when an event is being described. Of course, there were no video cameras during the war, so the only possible accurate video is of aged veterans, of which some is included. Nevertheless, the video is a weakness of this historical record, especially given the number of repeats."
1,Nice unit,Looks nice. worth the money but my unit leaked after 1 year and the phone number for replacement parts is no good so good luck when you have a problem. Still looks good
3,Hope it keeps working,"Bought one of these at the local warehouse store. We have issues with sediment in our lines out in the country. Unfortunately, the custom design of this unit doesn't make for finding replacement components easily. The unit looks great and has kept its looks as we have used it. However, we started getting a really restricted water flow from the faucet and it seems to be an internal problem inside the mixer. The flow got down to about 1/4 gal. per minute so wasn't usable as a kitchen sink faucet. I took the unit apart completely in about 4 hours (factor that into your price shopping) Then, the internal parts were all gummed up and soaked them all in vinegar overnight. I then got it all to function, but only got 1 gal / minute after putting it all back together. We can use it, but will probably replace the entire thing as soon as we can. Can't seem to easily find a manual or parts for it."
5,a great game,my 11 year old got this game last year and loves do not listen to the other people who less than 4 stars it is a great game
2,Extended Cut?,"First I'm looking at a leaf..then a flower..then a stream..now a bird..next a waterfall..over to a field of corn..and finally down into the angst ridden eyes of Colin Farrell as he stares into his co-stars eyes for what seems like a lifetime. I think I stopped breathing a few times during the viewing of this film. This should have been a National Geographic special instead of a movie. And people want an ""extended"" cut of this?? Get the Visine out people!"
1,Buyer Beware of which version you are getting,"The vendor states this is the original movie with a run time of 150 minutes, that is false. This is the shorter, theatrical version with a run time of 133 minutes. I wrote to customer service to edit the false advertising and hoping the get the longer version."
1,Hollywood at his best in rewriting rosy PC history of everything,"Simply ghastly. Orwellian notion of history. Thank God, ""The night of the iguana"" by John Huston, is available. The current american cinema is as bad as it was brillant from the 40's to the 60's.Question : why do some reviewers feel necessary to insult others critics rather than simply limit their opinions to movies ?"
1,The most money spent on a B movie ever!,"First of all, I never write reviews! But this film was so bad it inspired me to spare you the trouble of sitting through the whole painful experience. The script for the whole two hour film could not have been more than 3 pages long! The trailer is actually better than the film itself and not nearly as tedious, it has 10 times more dialog and action. Come to think of it, even the trailer might be a little bit too long. This is the slowest movie that I've ever seen... Oh, and by the way, this movie has one of the worst soundtracks ever. The music throughout the film is louder than the dialog, and nearly painful to listen to! If you don't believe me, or you are a sadist, watch it for yourself."
2,the director of this movie should be forced into early retirement.,"what a waste of production budget. the director and the screenplay writer(s) should be banned from directing and writing anything related to movie industry. it's so weird to watch three persons (one woman and two guys kept blabbering as some kinda voice in the head: 'who am i? what is love?....' i simply could not believe any movie would be shot in this way with 3 voice-overs. so there's a new trend to use narrators blabbing beside the director's commentary? do we really need that? this director who directed that drive-me-nuts 'a thin red line' now did it again! wake up, man, this is not a cool way to direct a panned-out movie. so tiresome and so pretentious, man. and 'breathtakingly beautiful'? 'two thumbs up'? give me a break."
3,The New World,"The look of the film was spectacular, visuals, landscape, clothing, Europeans and natives. The story took awhile to develop, but everything seemed to fall in place at the end. CPT Smith, Colin Farell's character, I thought should have cared more for the native girl, the Princess. She saved his life and he left her, back to his ocean exploring adventures and was not brave enough to tell her face to face. Instead he has someone else tell her he died on the voyage back home. The battles between the Europeans and Indians at the fort showed how brutal things were between ""trespassers"" and native Indians. Long epic of a story and movie...have to be in the mood for this one."
2,Was the New World about poetic life?,"I went to watch this movie with my brother not knowing who the director was but after 10 min, i thought it had to be the same guy who did THE THIN RED LINE. No other director use camera angles and use individual emotion such as he does, which is a credit to his ability to reflect onto the big screen like no other. With that said, i have to say i was disapointed in the fact that i was expecting more 'standard' direction that you see in most movies and not something like this. I would love to see him direct a horror movie which i would see in a heartbeat but come on now....we wanted to see something like the tv series LOST in some ways....new discoveries, not feelings.For fans of this talented director, you will not be disapointed. If you didn't like RED THIN LINE, you will NOT like this one."
2,A Lush Canvas..Waiting to Dry,"It's scenic, historically interesting, the newcomer playng Pocahantas is mesmerizing, Farrell is Farrell, Batman's been better, native Americans are great; but where is Magua when we need him? Someone called it a lush canvas, perhaps, but most viewers will be pre-occupied comprehending the ""European"" accents and waiting for the paint on this canvas to dry."
3,Probably comes off differently on the big screen...,"I watched this movie on DVD, and that probably made a difference in my experience. With that said, I found this movie very poetic and beautiful, but rather slow moving and in need of editing.On the plus side, I admire Colin Farrell, who always offers a powerful performance, and newcomer Q'orianka Kilcher was marvelous and has enormous potential for future roles.On the other hand, while I appreciated the lengths that the cast and production crew went to present an authentic Native American tribe, the director's ""noble savages"" perspective quickly grew weary, a problem that was compounded by the length of the film.Probably not the film for everyone, but if you have time and appreciate aesthetics in films, I would recommend watching this movie."
1,lots of visual style.......little substance,me and my partner are both real open minded people who enjoy a huge range of films. And we do really like The Thin Red Line. But this was a real boring piece of film making.....The whole film was just one huge poetry reading and I prefer to read poetry from a book.....It just doesn't goe anywhere and we found the love scenes even worse than those directed by George Lucas.Even the battle scenes were just poetry readings..........Watch Thin Red Line instead if you are interested in this director's work...That film is a masterpiece....This isn't.
2,Panders to snobs,"Pretty music. Pretty scenery. No plot whatsoever.Only attempt at a narrative is two hours of embarassingly pretentious voice-overs, mumbling and whispering about ""relationships"" and the ""meaning of life"". Sadly, speaking slowly over nature shots doesn't make a movie profound or interesting - even if there's classical music.Self-important people will relish explaining to their ""inferiors"" how good this film ""really"" was for years."
5,And the Oscar goes to...,"I doubt this movie's beauty and magic will be topped any time soon. I agree ""The New World"" should've won Best Movie; it was nominated for BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY and it should've won."
2,Tedious,"I fully expected this to be one those heavy-handed ""the white man is the devil"" flix. Happily, that was not so. However, this is one of the most poorly edited and tedious films I have ever seen. An odd choice to include a Mozart piano concerto as background music along with Horner's score. This is ""The English Patient"" for the 17th C.I watched this film on the same weekend I watched ""Shop Girl""...also a dud, although the similarities in the man/woman/man relationships are remarkable.Anyway, no more chick flicks for me....wish I had those five hours back...giving it 2 stars for the ""visually stunning"" scenery that everyone seems to be commenting on."
1,TOTALLY BORING,THE CONQUEST OF 1942 IS A SUPERIOR FILM........THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST BORING FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN.
3,Soooooo slow.,"Cut 45 minutes out and I'd easily give it 4 stars. An interesting story with very good acting, but just too slow to make it enjoyable."
1,Very Very Sorry !!!,"I would like to recall the message I sent earlier regarding my stuff not arriving on time. I would like to here-by state that my package did arrive on the day I wrote the message to Amazon. The actual problem was with the Postal Service from my end. They failed to inform me that the package arrived the previous week. I want to say that Amazon are really professionals in whatever they do and that I have full trust and confidence in them. I will, very soon, be viewing the DVD's and giving my review on it, even though I know that it is going to be really hilarious. This is one Fantasic BBC's comedy series that you can never get tired of watching over and over again."
4,"A classic of the ""Britcom"" genre","Although I wasn't around to see the original run of ""Are You Being Served?"", thanks to PBS I have come to appreciate this ususual, but often hilarious show. The double entendres are funny and sometimes surprising, especially since these shows aired on British TV (mention of Mrs. Slocombe's ""..."" is a standard in every episode). The early episodes are better than the later ones, especially when Mr. Lucas (my favorite character) was replaced by the decidedly un-funny Mr. Spooner. I'm glad these episodes have finally made the move to DVD, since the show is definitely a classic of the genre."
1,Not much help with ringing in the ears!,"I bought this hoping it would get rid of the ringing in my ears. Unfortunately, it has not worked for me. I'm really not sure what this product is good for, if anything. Maybe it works for other people, but it didn't work for me."
5,Easy to install,"I have wanted my own inversion set ever since I tried these at a gym a long time ago. Well constructed, easy to put together and to install in a doorway (you do need a power drill to make it easier). Boots are well padded and easy to take on/off. Great on my back and neck. I love the sit ups you can do on these, I feel my abs completely lifted and 'in'. Because of the way you mount and dismount, I'd say you need to be more on the fit side to use this type of inversion. There's not much to the DVD, but then there's not much to using this. . .get up there and hang, mostly. I love it."
4,life and times of Quanah Parker,The book arrived on time. The condition was good. Like many books about Quanah Parker if covers his life quite well.I recommend this book and the seller.
1,If you want to be bored,A boring regurgitation of many of the other books on his life. Not worth the money.
4,Good portrayal of peasant life,"This book created a new insight into the way we look at peasants. It is quite difficult to assemble together a story this well, and the parts that Wunderli creates seem believable considering the context of the novel. In addition, it shows how peasant life revolved around the festivals and that the time inbetween was rather dead time. It helped me look at the life and struggles of peasants (even the oppression) in a whole new light."
3,Careful with this saddle!,"This saddle is OK. The stirrup leathers came off 2 weeks later. I used it on one of my saddle club models. You might have to make your own girth hole for some models. It was a very pleasant surprise when I received it and it came with a decent saddle pad! However, the saddle did not look like it did in the picture. This is a pretty good saddle. However it is better for show then of play."
3,jamkat,"+ The feeder was shipped fast & it well packed,It was in good condition when I received it.+It is well constructed,should last a long time.+ It will collapse for easy storage in the off season.+ It is easy to hang from a sturdy handle that makes it easy to carry.+It is easy to fill from the top with a large opening.It has a nice perch but it's too close to the feeder for large birds .The ad said it was made for corn,I'm useing milo,so it will work ok with smaller seed than corn.-The weather cover is too small to reach around the feeder I had to improvise to make it work.I have not contacted the Co. because I think it might strech with time.- To fill the feeder two wing nuts must be removed,they are small & easy to lose.I dropped one in the leaves in the woods & had to replace.It needs a hinge type lid with a latch,whitch I plan to install myself.Over all it's a good feeder,it just needs to be fine tuned."
3,"Great start, slow finish.","I'm afraid I must agree with the reviewers below. The plot was promising, but ultimately unsatisfying. The alternate history scenario is fun for students of history and The Scarlet Pimpernel (look for Citizen Orczy, named for the Pimpernel's author), but there is so much explanation of the politics that the characters become a little lost. Their feelings are described, never shown by their dialogue or actions, so the reader feels very removed from them. The magic is a mere plot device, ignored unless there's no other way for something impossible to happen. There was also a rather strange shift in point of view; all of a sudden, we are being told the tale as seen through the eyes of a young woman not introduced until half-way through the book. Read Norton's Scent of Magic for better court intrigue and magic."
3,Ambiguous,"~I've never been a fan of alternate histories, but this one kept me interested long enough to finish--and I'm considering buying the sequel. The premise is somewhat unusual, in that most alternate histories of this type don't involve bringing characters between universes, at least not without their consent.I'm not a close enough student of Regency-era history to know how good a job the authors did at extrapolating the effect of the change in succession, but the world they created is at~~ least internally plausible, which counts for quite a lot.~"
2,minor improvement and very tedious mini games,"If you already own part one (like I have ) then don't expect to be blown away by part 2. The arena is a similar ""city"" setting, with no time differential. You're still driving during daylight. You can not drive at night. So the only difference is the fact that your car can jump.My biggest complaint is about the mini games. In order to unlock the hidden stages, and scecret characters from part one, you are forced to play the mini games, which are VERY...VERY...VERY!!! difficult to beat.Why didn't the progamers include easy button entry codes, like they do with other games? I like challenges but why should I spend 4 hours trying to get my car to jump from one rooftop to another."
3,same old same old,This game is good if u have no idea about ct1! its just the same gameplay witch makes it old fast. I wanted it to be differnt but its not. its still fun just not as good as it sounded like!
1,do not buy this game.,this game is the worst game of all time. it has horrible graphics horrible camera angles and bores the crap out of you quickly. everything looks so basic and dull the game is no fun at all. the cars dont move in the direction you want them to. i like trying out games a lot. but im sorry i ever checked out this garbage. for a fun time check out any grend theft auto or the most recent nascar game. this game is really bad and should definitely go down without notice. im so glad i only rented this one.
2,"Good print quality, many drawbacks.","I was initially very impressed by the print quality of this inexpensive printer. Though it doesn't claim to be a photo printer, I was able to print decent pictures with it using photo paper. That being said, there are three major drawbacks. First, it uses a lot of ink, very expensive ink might I add. While the printer itself is inexpensive, the per page printing cost is high because of 1)how much ink it takes to print an average page of text, and 2)that the cartridge is not refillable and there are no generic versions on the market. Second, it's loud, and I mean startles-you-every-single-time loud. Third, it's slow to spool and start print jobs. I'm running it on a Mac G3 with 128MB of ram via a USB connection. The printer will sit there and make tons of noise for a good 30 seconds before it starts printing. Overall it's okay for occasional home printing. If you consistently need to print a large number of documents, this thing might drive you crazy."
1,Didn't work from the get-go,"There was a time when Japanese products used to be reliable. Alas! I had problems with both the software and hardware of this terrible printer from the beginning. First, I spent 5 hours trying to overcome a persistent crash bug in the software, until belatedly finding a download patch from a third party. Then, when all began to seem well, the printer failed to print even a single page. Worse, since the level of ink in the cartridge is based on theoretical usage (not actual), it claimed that I had eaten up half my ink supply even though not a drop had been printed. At market prices, that's $15 in wasted ink.To be fair, I'll give Epson one chance with the warranty. However, I'm aghast to read in the fine print that they ""recondition"" all parts from my returned printer. I can only hope my piece of junk doesn't end up someone else's piece of junk. It belongs in the recycling bin."
2,Think Before You Buy This,"Yes, this printer may have good quality for the price, but you will end up paying...every few months for new ink. The ink cartridges for this printer last a fraction of the time of others. Also, refilling these cartridges is very time consuming because of the smartchips in the cartridges. I bought this printer on sale... and it is not even worth that! Save yourself the time and just buy... anything but this!!"
3,Dissapointed with the condition of the books,"The book itself meets my expectations, however the condition of the book did not. I had ordered three for gifts. Two of the three had a different cover and corner of pages were nicked."
3,Satisfied but not Thrilled,The shovel is really not much better than what I was using previously. Snow still sporadically sticks to it. It is just as hard to get all the way down to the ground as with others.
5,#1 GAME IN AMERICA!,"I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!! THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER MADE!! IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS YOU MUST GO OVER TO THE STORE AND BUY IT TODAY AND IF YOU DONT I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN AND RIP YOUR GUTS OUT (no! no! im just kidding!) THIS HAS ONE OF THE BEST GAME STORY LINES I HAVE EVER PLAYED (along with FF7, FF9, and more.)THE GRAPHICS ARE SUPURB, THE SPEED IS AMAZING, SONIC AND OTHERS NEVER LOOKED BETTER(they finally took away his chubby litte kid look and made him a teenager), A-LIFE IMPROVED, THERE ARE MORE ANIMALS AND MORE! IF YOU ARE A CLUELESS PARENT AND DONT KNOW WHAT TO GET YOUR CHILD THIS IS IT! (make sure he/she has a dreamcast)"
4,ok...,"If you want an action loop-t-loop forward going game go ahead, also with cute personalized chao.Except for one slight bug.The name is rong, no adventure just pure action (and a few brakes with chao)"
5,Sonic Adv. 2,Sonic Adv. 2 is a very great game. I really like how you could play as either Evil or Hero. That is really cool. Shawdow is one cool dude. I really think you should buy this game. If you liked Sonic Adv. you will love Sonic Adv. 2. So go ahead and buy it.
1,Is there anything unique about this band at all? No.,"Literally, this sounds like any rock band in the mid 90's. You can predict every single riff, the vocals are going to be a little whiney, and the riffs are just mediocre. There is nothing going for the band other than the fact that they were in Sleep before this. (Sleep is a much better band, by the way). If you like turd rock, be my guest, buy this."
3,"Handy, but limited illumination","I have a large kitchen table in the middle of the room, and occasionally need some more light to work at the table reading, or writing a letter. Being cordless, the lamp is very handy because it can be transported to almost any location. However, I was hoping for a lamp with a bit better illumination than it delivers."
2,And one more thing.....,"If you get ""too far ahead"" the computer makes up for it by slamming hr's ( off any pitcher, with any batter, off any pitch) amd lacing line drives through the infield. It becomes an avalanche. Sometime I keep the score down just to prevent this.Heaven forbid you give up 1 run. Many times next 5 batters will get hits on you. Bring in a top reliever and it won't matter. I have had a few pitchers duels but it's mostly slugfests. Ridiculous."
3,"No Hitter, No Glitter","Overall, I like WSB2K2. However, the game is not without its faults. I pitched a no-hitter with the game's signature player (Pedro). At the end of the game I ended up with 1 strikeout, no walks, and no celebrations. I think the catcher received player of the game. You'd think that there would be some sort of mentioning of this by the game's commentator, but nothing. The game is good and worth the $$ since the console price has dropped. Maybe WSB2K3 will be a hybrid of 2K1 and 2k2...Let's hope."
1,to play or not to play,this game whomps.the grapics stink.2k1 is alot better.i wasted money buying it and time playing it.dont be fooled by all the other ratings.trust me this game is not worth it.
1,my problems with the game,"homerun derby rules are completely made up: you get a number of pitches, not a number of outs. documentation is ridiculous, a 4th grader must've written it, it is wrong in many instances, and is pointless. throwing it away as soon as u buy the game is a good idea - it will save you from lots of frustration. franchise mode is pathetic: there is no free agent contract signing - all the free agents are put into a pool and you draft them. second, one to one trading? give me a break.playoff mode - you cannot choose the difficulty of play in this mode, it just kinda picks for itself. the game is decent, not good and definitely not great. i think they must have put in a lot of modes as a sales gimmick, but trust me, rent it before you buy it. you'll see just as i found out that the modes are for show and lack substance."
5,worldseries baseball 2k2 sounds great,"I, am really excited for this game to come out, I really didnt like how 2k1 had the players stop on a grounder to second.is wsb2k2 going to have a homerun derby Ichiro and minor leagues to pull people up? Sammy Sosa does a side-step when he hits a homer and the batting styles are different. Hopefully its alot better than world series baseball 2k1. I cant wait tell I buy that game.I'll Be the mariners and win the world series for the first time in mariner history."
2,"Millenium milk. The last millenium, that is...","I was a great fan of Red Dwarf for years. Season VII put me right off, and while its successor improves minutely, the difference is so very small its hardly detectable. None of the capable actors are given humourous material to work with - and we know they /can/ - and much of the satire is grimace-inducing rather than the intended effect. Avoid at all costs. Or rather pick up any vid from the first six seasons..."
1,"This tape, and along with the rest of 8, *%@^!","This was such a disappointment. I can't even believe they made this and put the Red Dwarf name on it. They peaked with series 6 and 7, but this just doesn't cut it! It is not worth buying, in fact it insults the whole Red Dwarf collexion! Captain Hollister is back, but where are characters like Ace Rimmer or Ivan McGruder??? Hollister wasn't that funny anyway. I have to say that commercialism has killed the true essence of Red Dwarf and why is it filmed similarly to an American Soap Opera. This is not General Hospital! Over all this was a very big disappointment! Don't buy it! It is not even worth a star for this review."
2,"Red Dwarf VIII: Well acted, badly written","Red Dwarf 8 was recieved eagerly in both the UK and overseas. Hovever, despite vastly improved special effects, it seems that the writers of Red Dwarf, for the first time for over a decade, have run out of ideas. The series was brilliant in its early stages, and maybe it is just overshadowed by the hiarious series 7, but Red Dwarf 8 just seems very substandard compared with earlier episodes. The acting is very good from all cast members, but it is unfortunately very poorly written. If you really want to see Red dwarf in its full splendour, I would suggest the newly digitally remastered Series 1,2, & 3 videos available in most video shops, and give this one a miss, unless all you want is to be dazzled by high-budget computer graphics."
5,Dragonballz,"This album is perfect for anyone who is annoyed with all the stupid mainstream music that you see brainless little highschoolers bopping their head to. Two songs on this album were featured in ""Broly the Legendary Super Saiyan"" which was the most recent DBZ movie to be released. It is a must have for DBZ music lovers and for anyone who likes in your face rock!"
4,True Tale I'd Say,"I lived in the area where this murder happened and remember it. I didn't realize all the drama going on that provoked the tragedy. The book was very well written and I read it in one sitting, which is something I never do. I would like to have saw some real names of some of the characters but I realize the reason for them being left out. The book was great!"
5,Cute as can be,~This is so pretty but it does get plugged up in no time. You can keep spraying vinegar on the sprayer parts but it is still cute even when it is not working.
4,Hours of Family Fun!!,"We have loved this basketball goal. It is very well made and the height adjuster is easy enough for a 9 year old. The frame is very sturdy and strong. We have spent hours as a family playing basketball.The only draw back is, it took two grown men (that are very mechanical) 3 hours to put together. Let just say my husband was not very happy about that!:)But all together, I love it!"
1,Ugh... No talent whatsoever..,"This so-so actress, no talent, bad singer, only 5'3"" tall so call French ""MODEL"", she disgusted me (Are there any better looking French women out there?). When I hear ""When I Say"", I just lose it. She CAN'T sing. Her retarded voice is really annoying."
2,Not Many Changes,This new edition does not have many changes from the previous. The cost of the book went up too much compared to the the minimal changes.
2,Krusell Elastic with Multidapt Leather Case for Motorola MOTORAZR Maxx V6 (with Spring Clip) (89221),The case of Krusell p/n 89221 is very helpful and conveniently fits on my Motorola MOTORAZR maxx V6.However I constantly have a problem with its clip.I'm hanging it on my belt and the lower end of the clip constantly being opened.I have to check all of the time if I still have my phone on my belt.I think the Krusell Co. suppose to replace the clip immediately from this case.
4,Not the best game out there...,"If you have diehard spongebob fans in your house, be sure to grab this game. It is a lot of fun for the games sake and it teaches how to count change, some math and introductory word formation. However, if Spongebob gets on your nerves when he's on television, it's worse with this game! I think of all the games we have, this one is the least challenging for my five-year-old. The Batman game provides more of a challenge and it seems to be more fun for him. This game is just okay, and isn't played as much as I thought it would be. My five-year-old loves Spongebob, but this game just isn't as much fun as some of the others, especially Letters on the Loose, Batman, Spiderman (all spelling and word formation, fantastic game!), and Number Raiders."
5,Go SpongeBob!,Daughter has this.Daughter is 4.Daughter loves this.Daughter plays with it all the time.Daughter becomes distraught when it goes missing in the sofa cushions or when her brother steals it.I love that it keeps Daughter busy for hours. :)
2,Veeery sloooow!!,I just purchased a 660U scanner. After a 20 minute trial I decided to return it and get my money back. It takes 6 minutes (yes six minutes) to scan a single negative in high res mode. This is absolutely useless
5,Excelent book in a Flash Line Story,In January I bought this book and it is simply astonishing!It clarified me many doubts of the life of Wally but overalls of their fears and thoughtsFor everybody who wants to know all for the fastest man alive
5,Mr. Nison is always tops!,"Mr. Nison is a fountain of knowledge and renowned expert on this topic. He is also a superlative teacher. Some reviewers have commented that this book is a bit simplistic; to which I say, well, I personally can always use a good refresher. One caution for newbies: candlesticks will NOT, in themselves, equip you to trade successfully. As Mr. Nison--much to his credit--consistently points out, candlesticks are best used ""in conjunction"" with ""Western"" indicators/moves. Mr. Nison even teaches HOW to use candlesticks with the latter. His experience, attention to detail, and writing/teaching ability inspire confidence and lead directly to real-life, practical results. Candlesticks are just hard to beat as that final piece of validation needed to make a trade. I depend on them, and would say that Mr. Nison does a fantastic job of making them intelligible for everyone."
2,Contains nothing novel compared to the 1991 book by the same author,"In 1991 Nison wrote the seminal book (five stars) on candlesticks (Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques, Second Edition). I understand if ten years later the author would like to make some extra money on book sales. I think that's how the current book fits in. In the introduction to the book he states that the book is created to appeal to both novices and people with substantial experience. With such an objective it is hard to write a good book, especially if you have already published one good book on the subject. The current book also contains annoying study questions with answers at the end of each chapter."
3,My candlelight has gone out!,"Actually I purchased this book at the request of my husband. He has read it and stated on several occasions that it is difficult to understand and not an easy read. That being said, he does like it!! He says he is learing (all be it slowly) but at least he is enjoying it. I looked through the book and it looked like it would be difficult to understand unless you know EXACTLY what they are talking about. There has been a few instances where my husband did not know what the writer was talking about or referring to on some of the grafts. I dont know, for that much money, I want to understand EVERYTHING in the book. In my opinion, the book was entirely too expensive! I wanted to wait for it to come out in paperback, BUT it already is paperback! I guess if you are into the stock market and investing, this book is ok."
1,Not worth the money,"When this product came in, it was made a really thin, flimsy material. It was dented in numerous places. I would not recommend this at all. We were expecting something made of a more substantial piece of metal.I really wanted to give this no stars at all, but it wouldn't let me - so I gave it one star under protest."
1,color completely unlike picture,The color of the fire engine was this ugly dark burgundy color with blue/green trim. Totally unlike how it's pictured and really ugly. I sent it back.
1,Horribly out of sync,Not sure if it is a bad press or if they are all this way but the audio and video is horribly out of sync where the audio sometimes is not the same song as the video. The seller offered to refund upon return but it was a christmas gift to my mother and just wanted to replace it so not sure if it is a bad production or just a bad disk.
1,Predictable. Expensive. Vapid.,"There is nothing in this particular episode that anyone with common sense wouldn't know already. In fact, if some of the ""information"" in this DVD seems helpful to you, you very seriously ought to reconsider going into business for yourself. It's that inane.I am just grateful that I only opened one of the two that I ordered, so I could at least get a refund on the other one.If this were a show on cable, I might watch it on the chance it might spark a random thought. But at $35 a pop, these DVDs aren't anything but someone's attempt at ""Making It"" at your expense."
3,Not Her Best,"Marcia Muller is my favorite author, and while I love the Sharon McCone series, I've also enjoyed her stand-alones. However, this one just didn't do it for me.I found all the environmental stuff boring, so the book didn't hold my interest the way her books normally do. I also didn't really care all that much about any of the characters, since I didn't feel they were that fully developed. Had this book been written by anyone other than MM, I probably wouldn't have even finished it."
5,A great game just like the N64 version only BETTER!,"This game is one of the greatest Third-Person shooter games available on any system. The PS2 just makes it better. The graphics are amazingly detailed and the sound effects are awesome! In the new feature, BOT Mode, you feel you are really in the game with all of the gunshots wailing past your head. It's one big shootout. This new mode is my favorite part of the game. It includes a custom version and challenges, which when you complete, characters become unlocked. It's a team version of the versus mode. The story mode has a great setting and for all beginners, a tutorial mode to explain the basics is available. You must take my word and buy or at least rent this game! It's a must-have for anybody!"
3,"good idea, fell short though",this game has a pretty good idea for the plot but the story sucks. the graphics were pretty good as well and some of the thing you can do are cool ex. hide behind walls and pop out and nail someone in the head. the lasers on some levels were annoying one hit from them and you're dead also they're HARD to avoid. there were also only 4 different weapons and all of them do the same damage. I wouldn't reccommend this game unless you're a real fan of shoot'em up games.
4,PS2 game,Always one of my personal favorites. No scratches on it so that is a plus. It played fine. Good game.
3,low on durability,"The design seems good, but this footbag began showing signs of wear almost immediately. I may start making my own. There has got to be a better way. I expected more from a product with the Duncan name."
3,"Taxes, Death and Trouble by C. M. Miller","I really liked this book. A real page-turner and exciting read. The plot line was great the and characters were very believable in that NONE of them were perfect. I am looking forward to the next book to see how the lives of the ""continuing characters"" progress as well as to see what new juicy murder mystery unfolds. I love Audrey's character. She is very down to earth and very smart. I really hope to see her get more directly involved in the sleuthing process and really show off her skills in future projects."
4,Colorful cast of characters,I loved this book. What a diverse cast of characters with strong undertones of social commentary. Good read!
3,easy reading,"This book is mostly entertaining, it may be interesting to compair it with other pilot biographies, but it is definitely more a bestseller than a history book."
3,Not the best I've ever heard.,Seems a little cool and academic for my taste. The trademark inner voices that Rachmaninoff are sometime lost. Not what I was hoping for.
3,Major League SHAM,"The HIGH HEAT series has always been a hit, because of it graphics, statistical tracking and Franchise mode.It seems that 3DO rushed this version out to capture the hype of PS2 before Nintendo and Microsoft release their highly touted game consoles due out this fall.The PS2 version is a skeleton of all that made HIGH HEAT one of the best games every made. Without a Franchise mode, which encompasses a three level minor league system , prospect draft, and great statisical outputs, this is just another baseball game.Please be cautious before you shell out any money on this game.At least rent it first and see if it's for you."
1,You must be kidding,"I read many of the reviews of High heat baseball and most of them said the game was great but the graphics were not so hot. Not so hot is the understatement of the year. The graphics are terrible. I mean worse than any PS1 game that I ever played. OK, the AI is pretty good but lets face it the graphics are what makes the game fun to play. The crowd noise and the announcers suck. You can jack a homer out of the park and the crowd barely reacts. The announcers repeat the same quotes over and over, many times the same comment will be heard consecutively. I wouldn't waste a dime on this game. My advice is to rent it before you buy it. I would recommend EA triple play. It does not have the AI that High Heat has but the game looks great and a lot more fun."
5,"cool, smooth and buoyant...","Recently retrieved, but captured in 1979, in the intimacy of the Paradise Studio, with Leon Russel, Christine Lakeland and others, this performance is obviously a must have. Pretty good sound and a lot of great songs, sometimes in jazz style sometimes more country. A pure delight for the aficionados of jj cale. And a brilliant example of the US culture that we love in France!Surprisingly, I notice that this dvd is now available here and not yet in USA ! Be patient !"
5,An autobiographical novel that hurts,"A beautiful teenage daughter waits patiently, loyally, dreamily; by turns hopefully and hopelessly for a fickle, messed-up mother; they've a lunch date in a Paris cafe. The size and the scope of the daughter's bereavement take up the whole of this slim book. She's had a lifetime of gentrified confusion, short bursts of happiness, rejection, and grief. Levy recounts this skillfully and stylishly, and with a blameless bitter heart. The remembered details of her childhood (toys, clothes, mundane events) take on a burning importance, as if they're all that's left -- after a catastrophe. There's a growing genre of these memoirs of yearning and loss, and this one is a fine addition."
5,Doo Wop at 50,I gave this DVD to a friend at Christmas. She was absolutely thrilled to receive it and LOVED watching it!!! Best gift ever!
3,We all make mistakes,"We all make mistakes. When I first looked at this show I was bothered by too many things. The obvious age of the performers and it's affect on their voices, looks, and movements. But I recently went back to view it again and I must say.....instead of being totally put off I admit there were some bright moments that for whatever the reason I missed the first time. All I can say is that my moments may be different from your moments. That being the case no amount of pitch problems, slow dance movements, and aging can ever take away the innocense of youth. This program (depending on how forgiving your imagination is) will take you back to a simpler and more romantic time. The night I put this back on I must have skipped through over 100 stations just to finally settle on this. It was my best choice then and most likely I will find those times in the future that this show will again transport me back to my youth. For that alone it's worth it!"
5,"A fine, scholarly work, yet an easy read","I found Professor Nadell's book clearly and eloquently written, and illustrated with beautiful images of the time period she examines. The concept that ideas about race can transmitted through text and images is an original and fascinating subject and she does a wonderful job examining it and explaining it to non-scholars. Kudos to Professor Nadell."
4,Potential Lotus 7 clone project,"I bought this book as an adjunct to Ron Champion's book on the same subject. Well written and also well illustrated, it is another approach to the same subject. While Champion's book translates metric measurement units into english, this one does not. That however, does not detract from the usefullness of the book as that can be fairly easily done anyway."
1,Major [waste of money],"Under the title of the book it says ""The absolute beginner's guide..."" Well take that VERY VERY literally. This book does nothing more than walk you through getting your feet wet with Reason. There is nothing here that you wouldn't get by going through the excellent Reason manual. Don't be foold by the promise of videos and samples either. You get 4 videos that tell you close to nothing and I have more fingers than there are samples on the CD. I also bought the Sonar Quick Start book from Wizoo. These books are blatently taking advantage of the fact that there's precious little info on these programs right now. The books are 48 pages with big type and lots of white space. They are the most insulting low content books I've ever seen or purchased. These are the kind of books that make you think twice about buying books online. They don't deserve 1 star, but that's the lowest I could give it."
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"Almost completely worthless. You'll be better off reading the ""Getting Started"" manual that comes with the program. The videos on the CD are kind of nice but there are few of them and they are certainly not worth the price of this book."
4,Decent...,This game is ok while the thing that kills me is after every mission the diary secences they are SO anoying! Also the LONG battles!if you want full joy out of this game get a gameshark!with out it the game takes hours for one fight If I were people who arnt into Stratagy games and just into the mechs dont even bother! the mechs are stupid looking except the 4 leged and regular AFW's....the characters are decent and the graphics are dull compared to the graphics ive seen like Shadow of destinys and others.I give it four stars since I beat games in 5 days or less this one took me a little more because of the battles and im a stratagy fan Nut!I loved Kessen and dont know why it had a bad rating!
4,Silicon cake dish,"Excellent pan. I especially like it for making an ""upside down"" cake or cornbread, they just pop right out onto a plate with no hassles!!!"
4,Not the best but its still fun.,"This may not be the funnest offroad racer out there, and the graphics really arent all that great(except in replay mode), but there is a lot too keep you going here. There is a total of 112 suvs and trucks that are all customizable.There are tons of parts to buy for your vehicles and much less limitations than on gran turismo 2. The handling and physics of the game are pretty good despite what other people may say. The point is if you like cars are trucks or suvs or whatever you'll probably like buying and custimizing the differant vehicles."
3,"A good game, but...","It has it's ups and downs, just like most games. The graphics and premise of the game are great, but sometimes the physics engine will frustrate. Especially on the snowy courses. While your vehicle is stuck spinning its wheels at the starting line, the computer competition takes off like they're on concrete. The braking is horrible. You can lock em up on concrete, and it seems to have very little slowing effect. 3 Months ago I would have strongly recommended the game due to GT3's continuously pushed-back release date, but with 2 weeks to go, save your money and buy GT3. It is fun being able to customize not only your engine, but the vehicle's appearance too. Not a bad game, but it has some flaws."
1,THIS GAME SUCKS,"If you like Oblivion you will hate this game. Crappy graphics, the most ridiculous dialogue ever and bad game play. I have never been this disappointed in a video game purchase. I really wanted this to be a good RPG. It is a joke in the office we keep passing it to new people... no one wants it or could stand to play it for more than an hour. We are on victim number five."
1,Why did someone ok this game?,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played. The game is broken to the point that I could not get past the first level, the graphics suck, and it feels like the game works against you to the point that it becomes tourture. If I had the money I would buy all of the games and bury them in the desert. I spent $60 on it and it is now a drink coster. I write this review in the hopes that somebody would read this and not buy it. I would not wish this game on my worst enemy."
1,tears of disappoinment,"i have to agree with the previous reviewers. i love rpgs to death, and when i saw this game for rent, i didn't even question. now i do question why i spent the rental money on it. the voice acting is stilted and cheesy; the graphics are inexcusably choppy and the combat controls are unwieldy, often leaving you facing AWAY from the enemy, getting mauled from behind.and to add to the tragedy, the story is uninspired and generic...this is not another oblivion by a long shot.please, rent this game if you just HAVE to play it, and save your money for Mass Effect."
4,Funktastic,"Let's face it: The Family Band knows funk. ""I Need More Love"" and ""Good Times (Three Stroke)"" are two of the funkiest funks to ever funk up an album. And the gospel/country-esque Squeeze show off Randolph's shred guitar-like chops on the steel guitar. Unfortunately, a few forays into Jazz, such as Calypso, don't go over as well as the rest of the album. I do feel it important to note that I owned this album long before the Grammy's, so that performance in no way influences this review.Overall, Unclassified is an album whose gems are so bright they outshine the mediocre songs by leaps and bounds. If these guys concentrated on their funk, they could easily enter the funktheon of Clinton and Brown."
4,The Brother is BADD!!,"I First got Hip to Robert Randolph Courtesy of watching NBA on TNT with Kenny,Charles&Ernie during the ""Charles Barkley Show""&When I Heard this Brother Wailing on the Steel Guitar like He was I was like I gotta get that set as soon as it drops.the Grooves&Vibe here are tight.I Like the Edge He plays with& I see the Brother having a long Career.maybe done the Road He can do a Duet Album with Ben Harper.putting those Two Cats Together Wailing on the Axe would be tight.but for now this Set is very much on point."
5,Excellent,"Robert Randolph is an extremely talented musician, and so are all the members of this band. They have a unique blues-rock style that will keep you listening for hours. The first song sets the tone for the CD as the rhythm picks up and the steel guitar starts to play. It's obvious this isn't your average band. With excellent lyrics, addictive melodies and some exceptionally talented musicians, this is a CD you won't want to miss. If you like any of the following styles - blues, rock, gospel, country, oldies, disco, Motown, soul - you'll love this CD."
3,Unclassified,"The first half of the album is good but the second half lacks. I'd prefer to hear more of the up-beat, hand-clapping stuff than the slower things."
4,miller,I've never heard anyone that sounds quite like them. It's a great mix of high-energy music! It's impossible not to smile and listen to them at the same time.
1,Old Nick Shows,"Whatever happened to Hey Dude or Salute Your Shorts? THOSE, for sure, should be on DVD. Not the shows that are still on air."
4,A book for the front lines of minstry.,"This is a needed book in today's world. There are some Christians so un-savvy that they turn non-Christians off and other Christians are so much like the world that they have no impact in society. The book deals with being wise and using the culture to a Christian's advantage as well as deepening one's faith and spiritual disciplines. If you are concerned about impression and impact, this is a book for Christians on the front lines of ministry."
3,Flimsy but pretty,"These are pretty, but the elastic seems a bit weak and it looks cheap. I wouldn't advise on buying gray, it doesnt really go with anything."
3,Well done....,"but - it gets just a little frustrating after awhile. You get used to just punching the O button to get the talking scenes over with, and then you discover - ooops, they really said something different this time, and suddenly the clock ticks and you're DEAD dead. Well, lets do it again - just to discover you get the same ending the third time you played through it as you did when you first finished it. Also it really isn't MASSIVE. First time I played through was under 4 hours (well, considering that I only solved like 24% or so in some chapters, but HUH? What else was there to do!?). Second and third time was like 3 hours or so. Which is easily accomplished, cuz you really don't have to listen to EVERYTHING they babble on about.I'm going to try to get all the endings, just to see if Eike can live happily ever after with Dana or something. So far my endings weren't really that satisfying.Graphics are awesome, by the way!"
3,Just OK,"The story line is somewhat interesting, but the graphics are not that great compared to other PS2 games. It is not too difficult to figure out what you are supposed to do, but it IS difficult to accomplish each thing that you are supposed to do.Overall this is a much better game to rent than to buy. If you keep at it you can make it through the entire game in 1 or 2 rental periods, and once you have gone through the game once, you will probably not want to play it again."
2,I don't think so!,"Yeah, the graphics and voice are cool but please...the actual game was sorry. I played through chapter 2 and stopped, I wasn't even remotely interested in what was going to happen next. You spend half your time reclining on the couch with the controller next to you watching a very long and boring movie hoping to god you get to play soon. I love murder mysteries but as far as I'm concerned Eike can stay dead because I'm not especially interested in finding out who killed him."
2,I guess it was sort of okay...........,"I bought this game over a year ago and I have not yet beaten it. It is interesting but I cannot figure out what to do on the second level so the game offers me no enjoyment anymore. If you like RPG's you should probably check it out. But if you're looking for a lot of action, you certainly won't find it here."
5,What fun!,"This is a really cute book, although there's not much reading involved. It's about a boy and his hamster who give a ""10 Minute Bedtime Tour"" to a family of hamsters. Each of the 10 little hamster children has a personality all his own, and it's great fun looking over each page to see what they are up to. (One of the hamsters is even a scrapbooker!)"
2,Almost no text,"I should have read the editorial reviews a little more closely before I bought this book to know what I was getting for my 4 year old. Pictures are wonderful, very detailed-but it's all pictures. No text to read to your child at all. Just make sure you know what you're buying."
5,Excellent VERY CHEAP INK!!,...the cheap ink works fine in this machine-but you don't want to leave any ink jet sitting for months on end without printing...I print all my paintball ads/flyers and business cards with this machine and it works great-I get about 300-400 full color ads off 1 color ink that costs me about 3.50-thats not bad in my book! ~TIM~
1,Paper feed problems,"When I bought my printer I was excited to get it home and start prining pictures and documents. My excitement soon faded, the paper feed is unreliable. Any time I start my printer it never feeds the first sheet, I have to coax the paper for a couple of minutes before it feeds.I have also been having problems with the color, when printing pictures the color does not match what is on the computer. To verify that it is a problem with this printer I have taken the same picture to other printers and made far higher quality pictures. I guess now I am so frustrated I am looking for a new printer and Epson will be on the bottom of my list."
1,"Way,way too complicated","I have watched the Facial Magic video numerous times since purchasing it and the routine shown is very complicated and requires way too much time to do. You need white gloves, a mirror and at least a half hour of undisturbed time to do the exercises, not to mention many tricky finger placements to ""trigger"" the muscles. Even the narrator on the video refers to them as 'tricky'. I honestly can't see myself doing these exercises consistently over any period of time.I think that if you are going to try and do facial exercises, they have to be fairly simple and you shouldn't need ""props"" to perform them. I was disappointed in this video and will ask for my money back."
5,preaty good,"I like it but im hard to disapoit,yet I say thare are some bad things about it like you can't stop moving him,it is a good thing that you can do a 2 player campain and the same rules apply with the 1 player as in not moving,the aiming is hard to use because you can only use the right analog stick and you can not move the camara,because you can not move him you can not kill the other enemys that you might miss,if you have looked at images online you can see that you can morf but not till you beat the game.All and all my brother and I find it a vary fun game but I recomend Sarge's Heroe's 2.P.S if you do get it make sure you have a frend to play with and make sure you and your fred have upgraded your guns."
1,The Game of the Year,Whoever created this game needs to be dealt with immediately by being put through some training. I wish I had their job so I could of at least put a little thought into this. My 2 year old son could of made a better game than this. Or maybe it was a 2 year old kid that created it. Besides all this it was an allright game to rent but wouldn't buy it. The idea was cool but the controls and getting forced to walk forward was a bit annoying. The weapons upgrading was cool but some weapons would fire too slowly when they were fully upgraded.
3,ok but no that good,the game is ok i think. the graphics are good but notin to get hyped up about. the storyline is awsome but the gameplay i dont like. the controls are hard and things are too complicated. if you like the other army men games and you heard different then that is your discision. over all i wouldnt get the game
4,This Game Ain't BAD just alittle buggy,"Theres one thing I can't stand is Fighting game/RPG/Surviaval horror game spammers or just plain Gaming snobs who just think Such companies Like This IS CRAP CRAP and CRAP, THE ARMY MAN GAMES HAVE ALWAY BEEN GOOD and fun just sometimes 3D has Problems with Bugs in there games A good Example of it Is Warroirs of Might and Magic but It can be beaten... ok enough with that I think This game has REALLY nice Graphics for A PS2 ""PORT"" of a PS1 game and I almost like the controls exect that they need to do better with the left analog against the tans. This game is Basicly like a Graidus clone only Your a Bulky Guy on foot and your shooting Tan guys and stuff. thats the way I say"
2,Gimme Some Sugar,This movie was bad in a good way. It was pretty fun. The best parts were Bruce being the Bruce Campbell character. Not for everybody but if you are a fan of Bruce and his crappy movies you will like this.
1,Who thought this was a good idea?,"My Name Is Bruce would be mildly entertaining if it weren't also blatantly racist. Ted Raimi participates in some of the most offensive yellowface I've seen in years as the character Wing. Mickey Rooney's portrayal of Mr. Yunioshi in Breakfast At Tiffany's is almost tame by comparison. It's a shame, because I would otherwise have liked to support this movie."
5,Bruce Cambell Humor,"Yeah the movie is corny, kinda lame, but what do you expect from Bruce Campbell. He makes fun of himself throughout the whole movie, even having the locals misspell his name on a poster. Yeah he makes fun of the chinese or what a reviewer called racist. But most of us orientals just smile looking up from our bean curd and keep on trucking. I would think the French would be bad mothing this movie as well as the white gys in the backwoods for the way they were shown in this movie. It is part of the way Bruce Campbell's movies are. Entertaining if you like Bruce Campbell movies but if you hate them well what can I say?"
5,I love this book,This book is amazing. I recommend it to ANYONE who is moving out to a city on their own. A++++++++++++++!
4,Logging a Lot of Time on This Game,"My son is a baseball fanatic, not video game, but playing the real thing. He has logged a ton of time with this game. This is an arcade style game, nothing terribly realistic about it (guessing the MLB games are more like watching real live baseball). He likes the whole turbo pitch and hit concept. Scoring a ton of runs. The homerun derby prize.The graphics are decent. Controls are dirt simple. Learning curve is very small.Given that this game is on deep sale right now, it's a very good bargain. I call it a great investment, many hours of fun."
5,It is as good as I was told.,"I used this book for my son when he was 3 yrs old.Now, his reading level is about 3-4 grade, whichis very outstanding. I did give him a lot of booksto ready. He is enjoying reading very much. Now,I am going to buy one for my 3 yrs old girl."
1,Don't bother,"I am an avid horror film fan and this movie was a total disapointment. ***SOME SPOILERS***I understand the point, innocent people who were murdered in the past want revenge against the decendants of those who killed them and reside on Antonio Island. Okay that could be interesting...but it goes no where. Maggie Grace's character comes back to her hometown b/c she's been having weird dreams. Slowly she starts to remember/figure out the truth about Antonio's founding fathers. But why would she have these premonitions, she isn't a relative of the people who were murdered (reincarnation??). The ending was abrupt and I'm still not sure what it means or why the ghosts went away. Overall I would say do not see this film, I mean I've watched some low budget, crap horror films that have left me more satisfied than this movie."
5,Good Movie,"This movie is a pretty good remake. I love the old errie town. Its true this movie is not The shining, but I think it is worth your renting money. I went to the theater and saw this movie. I really didn't get scared but I love the town and scenary. If you want to see a good movie, rent this today!"
4,New Fog,"A good feeling updated version of a classic. I love watching the original slasher movies around autumn/ fall as it gets you in the spirit of the season.Watching the remake was always going to be interesting seeing how long ago it was when the original was thought of and made.However modern day artist's make them their own character's. However i don't feel will be as memorable as the original starsAlthough it shares the name 'The Fog' as the original title, it does not really tell the same story at all, making it a good twist for today's audience, and some nostalga for those that remember the original.Doubt anyone would be dissapointed viewing this movie, oh and 'Tom Welling' looks pretty good too in the fog, not forgetting the shower!Scott Curtis/England"
1,The Fog or Wuthering Heights?,"This is so bad I don't even know where to begin. I hadn't realised I was buying Wuthering Heights in the guise of a 'horror' film. ""The Fog...a Love Story""? Total rubbish, utterly ridiculous.I think the biggest horror of all is John Carpenter was on board as a producer for this schlock? This played out more like a drama. It's way too slick, the CGI did nothing but detract from an already boring film.All I can really say is I hope to God that John Carpenter makes sure Escape From New York is off limits to anybody getting the idea to re-make that classic. John...PLEASE...STOP THE MADNESS!"
2,Why????????,"Im a big fan of the original film. So I tried to look at this remake as its own film to ease the pain. On a positive note, the special effects are better than the original. Though 25 years later they should be. I think if this movie wasnt a remake people would like it better. Its not that bad if you put it on its own agains most modern horror films. The acting is decent and that goes a long way.BUT... this isnt its own movie. It is a remake of the classic Fog. And if you compare the two films, this one fails. Why change the story so much? Why change the characters? If you are going to remake a movie try to keep it like the first one. Dont go and change 80% of it. If you do that you may as well make a brand new film and not a remake."
1,A floating candy bar in the pool of life,"Regardless of whether or not you liked the original The Fog by John Carpenter has nothing to do with this complete and total bowel movement of a remake.Every single person in this movie performed some of the worst acting I have ever seen. Let us review the credits shall we -Tom Welling (TV's Smallville), Maggie Grace (TV's Lost) and Selma Blair (Hellboy) and directed by Rupert Wainwright (Stigmata).Smallville, Lost, Hellboy and Stigmata. Doesn't that just say it all? Kind of like the big yellow FALLING ROCKS! sign you see on dangerous rocky mountain passes.Neither Tom Welling, Maggie Grace or Selma Blair can act their way out of wet paper sacks!The Fog is a good story/plot done wrong by mediocre Hollywood imagination and mind-numbing acting talent. What could have been a standout, knock you over remake turned into what is found in most children's diapers."
1,"OMG, what a stupid, stupid movie","Ok look, this movie is simply garbage through and through. The acting is HORRIBLE. The script is HORRIBLE.The concept of the Fog coming and bring with it death should be easy to turn into a decent move but by a miracle they failed to do even that.The fog comes, the main actors start walking around and suddenly the town is in ruin?! They don't show anything. The most you get is a dog in the distance yelping and the main character saying ""lets get out of here"".Ridiculous.The best action sequence they could come up with was some people jumping off of a boat IN SUPER SLOW MOTION with a small fire on their backs and flame-retardant goo smeared all over their faces.Please whatever you do, I beg you not to waste another second of your life considering to watch this garbage."
2,wanted so badly for this to be as good as the original,"I consider myself a HUGE fan of the original THE FOG, and had high expectations of this remake. Unfortunately it ended up not only being a poor remake, but a pretty flimsy movie in general. I can't say I hated it, but unless you have a must-see feeling because of the title, I can't say I'd recommend this movie to anyone.It does have some recognizable actors, such as Tom Welling from Smallville and Maggie Grace from LOST, and it has some good special effects to be sure, but that's about all the good things I can say about it.Don't even get me started on the ending, which was the final nail in the coffin for me."
2,Lost Potential,"Keep in mind while reading this, I've never seen the original ""The Fog"" by John Carpenter. So I'm reviewing it from that perspective.There was a lot of potential I could see in this movie. However, very little of it was delivered. The characters were very thinly developed and the story was just plain silly and bad. The acting by most of the people was very unconvincing. But what do you expect from a horror flick? In the end it really wasn't scary at all and opportunities they had to make it truly scary they passed over. Maybe this was to prevent it from getting an R rating, which finacially is probably a better move in this day and age.But I will give it thumbs up on the special effects. There was some pretty amazing stuff that I'm sure the original could not even come close to copying.Unless you are a horror or special effect nut, I wouldn't bother with this movie. Otherwise, go at it but don't expect much."
2,A Big Let Down....,"I was looking forward to this remake of The Fog.After all, no John Carpenter film could be bad could it? Well, this one was. I saw the unrated version thinking this will be scary. That is not the case in this movie. It is quite boring at times and a let down from the original. By the end of the movie, you are sick of seeing so much fog, which actually looked like smoke to me. I think the only reason this film might be popular as a rental is the fact that Tom Welling from the show Smallville is one of the main characters in this film. There were a couple of scenes that made me say ""cool"" but other than that, this remake needs to be remade! I'd suggest renting...... not buying this movie if you are curious."
1,These are really small--not what I was expecting,This product came up in a search for key rings. These are far smaller than I had expected--not practical for keys. I just threw them out. Maybe there's something else they'd be useful for.
4,Hard to put down,"Ethan Decker is a broken man. Something went wrong while on assignment for the CIA and his five-year-old son was killed. He leaves his wife and his job and is hiding out in the desert fighting his demons. A few years later an old operative from his team shows up, two children in tow. She dumps the kids and takes off, and when Ethan catches up with her, she's dead. The only clue is the last call she made on her cell phone - to Ethan's ex-wife, Sydney. The children tell him a fantastic story of being kidnapped and held on an island by people they call the ""Keepers,"" and thus begins a cross country chase where the line between the good guys and the bad guys keeps jumping. Plan on sitting put for a while, this one is hard to put down."
3,Good story,"I did enjoy this book, but was somewhat disappointed after hearing so much hype about it. To call it gripping is a bit of an exageration."
2,"Call me Agent Decker, but don't call me in for black ops...","I don't know how Patricia Lewin found me. I was a simple grad student in New Mexico studying complex systems and biology. She must've tracked me down through the trail of tutorials and academic papers that I left online using my academic avatar, ""Ethan Decker"".I only studied Tai Chi for a year, but Lewin makes me look much better than I really am. And I don't speak (or think) in so many cliches either--except for when assassins threaten my wife. Then, of course, I want to make them pay!Not particularly erudite, but a perfect post-dissertation page-turner."
2,pictures,This book is all about magazine covers. Marilyn was on a lot of magazine covers - what's interesting to me is that most of the pictures of Marilyn have no real background. Her photo is literally cut out and pasted on a single color background.
5,"If you wonder about the meaning of life, this might be a place to start.","Don't be fooled -- despite funny-man Bill Murray in the main role, this isn't a funny movie, although it has plenty of funny movements. This is about a man in the '20s whose experiences in WWI have led him to question what the point is of all the social status emblems we obsess over in the civilised world. He doesn't intend to just sit on his butt thinking about it, though. He goes out into the world try and find out. The answer is as true as any you will ever find, even if it isn't what you were hoping for."
1,Miscast,"In ""Lost in Translation"" Bill Murray showed his abiity as a serious actor.""The Razor's Edge"" was too early in his career for him to attempt it. I found it impossible to believe his character. He seemed to be playing at trying to be real, and the result was shallow and unconvincing.I was already familiar with the book, which I liked immensely, and the film with Tyrone Power was so perfectly cast that those actors were the people they portrayed.I know many people will disagree with me, but so be it. Nice try, Bill, but it didn't work for me."
4,An introduction to Maugham,"This movie served to introduce me to whom I consider to be one of the most enjoyable writers of the 20th century. I have since gone on to read, and re-read, other works by Maugham but ""The Razor's Edge"" continues to be my favourite.Murray's movie brings much more humanity to the characters than the earlier Tyrone Power version; furthermore, the humour that Murray adds to Larry's character is indeed a welcome addition. The movie version by Bill Murray, in short, does justice to the novel.To me the book and Murray's movie version of it complement each other. Read one, watch the other, and enjoy!"
2,See the Original Version instead.,"The original version, released in the 1940s and starring Tyrone Power, is far superior to this re-make. As another reviewer said, Bill Murray is a miscast... far too smarmy to play this character.As in so many other cases, the original version far outstrips the re-make."
5,The only real superman,Christopher Reaves was and still is the best Superman out there. No offense to the ones that have portrayed the caped Kryptonian or that are portraying him today. But this item is a must have for any Superman fan.
3,"Good value, light on features","For the price you really can't beat this collection. There really aren't any special features, but who needs that when all the movies are so long? I really would have liked to have seen some ""making of"" types of things, but the picture quality and sound are pretty good."
2,Disappointed,"This set was supposed to have the Christopher Reeve ""Superman 1-4"" movies, but #3 was missing and instead, there were 2 #2s. It was especially bad because the movies were a gift from ""Santa"" for my 6-year old son. Further, the seller could not send me a #3 replacement, but offered to refund me $9. However, i still have to go buy #3 on my own."
2,Full screen versions should be offered!,"The DVD releases of the Superman movies do not seem to offer full screen versions of each film. As a Superman fan, I find it upseting that standard versions haven't been added to the DVDs. The four Batman movies offer full screen and widescreen, so why is Superman being excluded from this? Like many other people, I do not like watching widescreen movies. Since Warner Bros has been able to release DVDs that offer standard and widescreen versions to fit people's tastes, why can't it do the same with Superman? I also feel that the price of the Superman collection set should be lowered since it lacks this feature. People who enjoy the widescreen version probably feel that they're getting their money's worth. Those who prefer the full screen may not be."
2,Shipped poorly,"The product arrived in a ""velvet"" pouch. The chain was in a complete knot and I was unable to untangle. I ended up breaking the chain and purchasing a new one, as there was not time to return before Christmas. I would think twice before purchasing necklaces from Amazon again. Disappointed to say the least."
4,Stotan is a great book,"This book was very remarkable. There are twists and turns around every page. The author did a very significant job writing all the tragic issues such as racism and domestic abuse. The book also talks about relationships and how to deal with almost the worst thing that they can throw at you. Stotan week is a week that Jeff, Lion, Nortie, and Walker have to deal with athletic and emotional roller coasters. In the beginning the book was a little unorganized. The book was a little slow in the beginning. It improved greatly towards the middle and even more in the end. I am recommending this book to older children, 12-17. It is a very short yet good book."
1,You should never choose this book to read.,"Out of the pages that I read I thought that the book was not that great, but when we talked about it in class it sounded alright in some parts. I like boks with more action in them and i don't think this one had that much action. This book seemed very boring to me because I am used to reading action books."
5,One of the saviors of our dear music!!!!!!!!!!,"I love Billy's voice. Since the day I heard ""I Smell Smoke"" on the radio, I have been hooked. Soon after I bought his debut CD, I began to research his past. Little did I know that Billy Yates had written songs from George Jones, Tracy Lawrence and Gene Watson.""What Do You Want From Me Now"" is a true country song. Yes - it does have a popish beat, but the majority of country songs do, these days. This is what country music should sound like. Billy, I thank you for keeping it country and real. May God bless you - and keep you well.Christopher R.Knoxville TnHONOR THY MUSIC"
3,"Holy S**t , what the f**k did i just listen to!!??","I was in Newberry Comics the other day and my friend kept telling me to ""get Daughters man?"" I'm like ""who's daughters?"" Well, i was in for a big surprise. Turns out, this Providence, RI based bands' bassist and vocalist worked at the very store i was in. Me and my friends shook hands with the bassist and talked to him for like 5 minutes. Pretty sweet! As for the CD, the only words i can even come close to comparing it with is Pure utter chaos. Coming in at just over 11 minutes, each song is under 2:00 in and of itself. 11 songs for 10 bucks. Hmmm, uncle sam strikes again!! Completely unintelligible lyrics, and somewhat shady track names make this a selective listen, but if you're into crazy ""grindcore,"" for lack of a better label, definately check this out. I only rated it 3 stars because i just got it yesterday and the majority of the tracks are under a minute."
3,decent album,"i wasn't much of a fan of As The Sun Sets, so i hadn't really paid much attention to daughters. but then i happened to catch a live show of theirs and i was fairly impressed, so i slapped down my $10 and got the album. the production is much better than any atss album. everything is much clearer. the drumming is exceptional, and the guitars move at an insane pace. the vocals are interesting to say the least, switching between a low mumble and what sounds like a woman screaming bloody murder (the vocalist is a man). why only 3 stars? first, the cd is about 11 minutes long. of that 11 minutes, probably about 5 is filler noise at the end of the tracks. that leaves the listener with about 6 minutes of music to enjoy. second, the members of the band are all extremely cocky. this cd is only worth buying if you are a huge fan of the grindcore genre, or if u can get it used at a good price"
2,It will cost you a dollar a minute.,"Imagine if all bands charged this rate. Your average heavy metal cd would cost 40 dollars. Progressive metal bands would be charging from 60-80.The music on this cd is great, but it's insulting that the band and the label markets this is a full length. There's a reason most grindcore albums have 20-30 tracks. Besides, how lazy do you have to be as a band to exist from 2001 to 2008 and release a total of 35 minutes of music?That's 5 minutes of music a year. Very hard working band.Don't get me wrong, the music on the cd is great. Whether you call it grindcore or not, it's intense and imaginative. I just hope no one is actually giving their money to these people."
1,Telesteps 1600 Ladder,This ladder is hard to extend. The locks jammed after the second use and has not worked since. Very pricey for a product of such poor quality.
5,Great game,"For anyone who has the Word/Letter/Math Factory DVDs, this is a great find. You don't have to own the movies to enjoy the game though. My [...] year old loves this game, and while she knows all of her uppercase letters, she still required some help with the lowercase, which this focuses on as well. This also allows for her to learn and practice how to write all of her letters. Overall, she plays this game the most out of all of her leapster games."
2,It is officially time to give up,"Camp lo is back on the scene again to give the industry another weak album. The only thing you can say about this group is they are consistnt with putting out garbage. Uptown saturday night was a fantastic album and is a classic to this day. But the follow up releases display weak lyrics, subpar beats, and some horrible hooks. I tried to like the album but it just didn't work out. Luckily, i got the album for free so I'll just delete it instead of using it as a coaster."
2,Why?,"I never read the script, but I did see the film. The best word to describe it is disappointing. I heard a lot of buzz about this film. After I saw the film, I didn't get why there was so much buzz for this film, a '90s version of ""The Graduate"" with a lot of promise that goes awry towards the end. I like films that have quirky characters so long as they are believable and have reasons for being quirky. Why any of the characters act the way they do in the film is beyond me. What starts out as a black comedy that would involve revenge between a young man and a tycoon ends up going all over the map. If anyone can tell me why this movie was so excellent besides saying ""It's Rushmore"" or ""It's cool,"" please let me know."
1,Love him or hate him - it's pure Ed Wood,"I'm not sure about the ""Not available Yet"" tag on this item - it certainly IS out. I own it. In fact, I was logging on hoping to sell it!That being said, the movie is exactly as advertised - Ed Wood soft porn. You know you're on familiar territory when the ""actors"" begin our little romp with references to Bela Legosi.Is there a plot worth reviewing in a movie like this? Well... is there EVER in an Ed Wood film? You don't watch a movie like this for the quality, the acting, the writing or... *Especially* the porn. You watch it because Ed is so lovingly bad, and so thoroughly consistant, it's like spending time with an old, slightly insane friend. All the standard props are here - undead, slightly dead, mostly dead (and an almost erotic lesbian scene). But in the end one star is all it gets, and is probably more than it deserves. Which would probably thrill Ed. ""One star? GREAT! I'll get 1 1/2 next time!"" Gotta love Ed."
1,Incomplete. Not all three volumes.,"I returned this item because it is not the complete work, although there was no way to tell from the description. It was nicely bound, and I certainly liked that aspect better than the three part copy I subsequently purchased, which is not available to review, sad to say. Buyer beware. Being able to see the contents page is very important, in both cases. There was a better edition available than my second try, but I didn't know it in time.Amazon did refund my purchase price, and I appreciate that very much."
5,Alien Triple Pack,I bought this item for a gift. The price was inexpensive and it was received in time for Christmas. I recommend this item.
3,Mediocre set,"To put it bluntly, your better off getting the quadrilogy set than this one. The quality of the films are not there. The only redeeming thing is the price."
3,Interesting book,Interesting book with contains some reflections about the possibility of rebuilt the Mithraic Mysteries nowadays. It's very curious to read the different hymns written by the author as an intend of imagine how was the Mithraic Cult.
3,Just okay,"Relatively amusing book, but not much of a mystery. The situations are rather contrived - every single time Lady Rose is in danger, Harry appears seemingly out of thin air and rescues her. It's all a little too convenient. I lost interest in ""whodunit"" pretty early in the book. The ever evolving relationship between Rose and Harry was the only interesting part of the book for me."
3,Dissapointed,"Okay, like everybody else I had been waiting for The Sims 2 to come out for awhile. The game is great but it runs too slow. Downloading the game wasn't the problem but when I have to wait 15 minutes to get from a house to the neighborhood...that's a problem. To top it off I have a brand new computer. This really sucks and even if they come out with expansion packs, I won't be able to get them becasue my computer would run super slow. For those of you who haven't bought it yet, make sure you have a computer that costs atleast 2,000 dollars so you can enjoy this 50 dollar game."
5,This is the best sims game ever!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is SO cool. I think the best part is that you can have all of those diffrent houses and what I think is the most important reason why the game rocks is that you get to have more than one level, you can even have a basement!!! The biggest house that I have seen was 4 floors! It had a basement and 3 floors above that! That to me is a huge house.I really think this game is the best game yet for all of those sims fans. BUY THIS GAME!!!!!! You wouldn't be a true sims fan if you didn't have this game along with almost all of the other sims games."
1,"Boy, did Amazon drop the ball on this one.","I'm sure the game will be terrific once Best Buy delivers my copy. I pre-ordered from Amazon, like the other reviewers, and at the time the estimated delivery date (with free shipping) was 7-9 days after the release date, as you would expect. Then two days before the release date the estimated delivery date changed to sometime between Oct. 20 and Nov. 4. I tried changing the shipping options, but the delivery date stayed the same. This is completely unacceptable, of course, so I've cancelled my order and ordered my copy from Best Buy online. When I pre-ordered from Amazon I expected the experience to be like the pre-orders for the Harry Potter books - product shipped on the day it's released. It's not like there's any reason for there to be product shortages - it's not a lawn chair, it's software. It's easy to burn extra copies. Bad planning, Amazon - we expect better, and you're losing sales by the hour as a result."
1,Horrible Game,I highly suggest that you don't get this game. It is a huge wast of money. They priced this game $49.99 when it should only be worth $9.99. Unless you have the newest computer then you have to buy a whole bunch of extra stuff like new video cards and sound drivers. I always have a very highly updated computer but I still will have to pay a lot of money just to play this game. Although I will probably end up returning it for it is not worth the trouble. When I first got this game I tried it on 2 of my computers (windows 98 and windows me - it is said to work on both of those computers) when it didn't work I thought that that particular package just didn't work. But when I brought home the exchanged one that one didn't work either. So I tried everything that it says to try (even shutting down the virus scanner and other background tasks) and it still didn't work. If you bought/buy this game I suggest that you return it.
1,freezes my computer,"I can't even really play. It moves so slowly. I have a new computer it is only 4 months old and more than half the memory is not used yet, so I don't know why the game is so slow."
3,Better than the normal LeapFrog Fare,"My son is 3.5 and is beginning to recognize some of his letters. The game fits any level preschooler since it can be played in different formats. But they must have a knowledge of colors at minimum. The other plus of this game is that is it fast and allows all players to win. With short attention spans that is good. The cards seem durable, but I worry that if even one were lost or damaged the game becomes inoperable. Make sure that you take that into consideration before leaving your child unsupervised with the game. But overall this is one of my son and my favorite games to play together."
5,Can't say enough good things about this shoe! So comfortable!,"I love heels but also want a shoe that is comfortable to wear all day. This shoe fits the bill. Very true to size. There is extra cushioning in the shoe footbed which makes it very comfortable. It also provides the extra bounce so your feet won't get tired. The heel and the shoe front has a non-skid sole that really grips the floor so I feel very safe walking on polished, super-slippery floors with these shoes on. When I am wearing these shoes I don't feel like I am wearing heels at all. I go shopping in these very often and can walk for hours without getting tired. Perfect pair! I am going to buy them in all the colors I can get!"
2,Tolerable,"I am sorry to offend anyone, but I find this situation comedy rather bland and dull. The jokes are a bit corny, and each time an episode tries to educate people or contains a ""life lesson"" sort of moral, it seems a bit as if it is being forced down the viewers' throats. There are many other educating programs that teach lessons while being humorous in the process out there, and Steve Urkel does not redeem the rest of the series enough for anybody else. I apologize to the creators of ""Family Matters"" and every single member of its fan base."
1,Absolutely useless piece of junk,"I've been reading various books and reseraching onlie lately and this is the worst book I ever seen on the subject. In fact, this is not even a book it is printed on an ink-jet printer and doesn't even have page numbers, etc. If it has anything good content wise that wouldn't bother me but there is really no useful information in in either. ... I would recommend ""How to Hydroponics"" by Keith Roberto as it has a decent print quality and lot's of photos and a step by step structure."
1,Stay Away!!!,"I bought these thinking that they would help my grafitti recognician and would keep my screen w/o scratches, but I was TOTALLY WRONG!! There are 2 MAIN reasons why not to buy these.1) Almost IMPOSSIBLE to get it straight on the screen and with out bubbles in it.2)Makes your screen VERY blurry and hard to read. You can no longer use programs such as ""Palm Mirror"" because the shean on the screen that is used to give you a reflection, is gone.Luckilly I was able to return these TWENTY DOLLAR dissapointments without any trouble. I can't strees enough, DO NOT BUY THESE unless you want to totally waste 20 dollars!!"
3,We like curious buddies but....,"My son loves the curious buddies videos. He would probably watch this one more but I don't like playing it cause the voice of one of the singers sounds very very creepy to me. I play the ""let's build"" curious buddies video all the time. The whole family likes that one."
3,Better options out there,"Im not going to say this stuff is terrible it is not a 1 or 2 star but there are much better options out there. You should check out the SF Signature chocolate tastes better, flows better, and cheaper therefore much better product. I use to buy this stuff for my business but now use sf signature chocolate and we are much happier."
4,Fischer Price cat terrorizer,My toddler likes it. He likes to run it into the wall and spin the tires. He pulled all the stickers off within the first week. Turning radius is terrible but on the lawn it does great.
4,Good book.. a bit too politically correct,"I enjoy this book and look at pretty regularly. I plan on using some of the details on future construction projects. However, the author is a bit too politically correct for my tastes. She keeps reminding us how ""poison"" vinyl is. That sort of bothered me. I am sure, given a choice, most people would choose to live a beautiful wooden or stone home rather than a vinyl clad manufactured home or tract home.. however lets be realistic. Those types of home are often what is affordable to the average family. Other than that issue.. I would recommend the book.. it has some great pictures and lots of information about bungalow exterior details."
1,The Last Confederate,I've been a Civil War buff for 20 years. I've read and watched just about everything on the subject. I must say this was one of the WORST Civil War movies I've ever seen. I think that what the family are doing to preserve their family story is important. If you research Captain Adams the movie is completely diffrent then real life. There was no escape from prison. There was no rescues. Even the title of the movie is misleading. Wasted Money. Also very bad acting.
2,Plodding and routine CW drama,"Some nice camera work, decent efforts by scores and scores of CW reenactors but the plotline circled and went right into a dark morass. I would not purchase this DVD. Get it from Netflix if you have a hankerin' to see something new with Union men and Rebs blazin' away at each other.Routine romance angle, Southern hero and Union wife. The few black people in the film were in the distant backgrounds except for one woman doing laundry. The cast was weak and just didn't fit their roles. It could have been so much better but seems to me like the director found where there was to be some large scale Civil War reenactors/battles and quickly assembled his cast and embedded them with the too many clean shaven Rebs and Yanks.Just my thoughts."
1,not so much.,"Terrible. This movie tries to be ""Cold Mountain"" but fails miserably. The romance story within it is boring and uninspiring and the acting is rather sub par. My favorite parts where when the camera pans over a dead union soldier and you can clearly see a large gold wristwatch on the actor's wrist. Later on in the movie the last confederate is getting ready for the battle and his belt buckle reads ""US"" instead of ""CS"". Bad acting, bad plot, and a lack of attention to detail not to mention bad music and repetitive themes. don't waste your time watching this movie. It is like a vanity film."
1,Was slavery even an issue?,Not a bad film if the fact that slavery doesn't seem to have any effect on any person involved.
5,By Far The Best Baseball Game for PS2,This is the best baseball game for Ps2! The Graphics are the best I've seen. So good that my Aunt walked in while I was playing this game and asked me what game I was watching!
3,"Not Great, Decent!","I was hoping this would be the end all of all baseball games, but it isn't. Pitcher hitter graphics would rate a 4/5, it looks decent, not as good as Madden graphics though. I would recommmend you rent this game and wait until next year to see if the end all of all games comes out. I would hope for a game like baseball stars playability but ps2 type graphics.Cool feature: controller rumbles when out of strike zone for pitchingBad Stuff: I can't find a franchise mode, does it exist? graphics bad for fielding balls, guys small and don't move realistically players look ugly when they throw, not realistic player move so slow when fielding, and sometimes they are far from the ball but it miraculously gets scooped up bad camera changes for fielding sometimes, when ball goes down a baseline"
3,All Star Baseball is OK,"THis game is not that good or bad. The graphics are sweat and if you like baseball the gameplay is cool. What i dont like about the game is the bad camra angels and how hard it is to get a realistic game i have started a season with the reds and after 5 games Griffy has 12 homeruns but my team has not won a game. Also this games roster mode is relly bad you cant do 2 for 1 trades witch doesnt allow you to trade for some big names. The things I like about the game is pitching it is hard when you start out but after a while you will get the hang of it. If you are a die hard baseball fan like me you will see that you have to know the game to be able to pull off some wins. I am sitll learning the game but in time i think i will get better. So all in all the game was not the worst baseball game of the season ""that goes to high heat baseball"" Next year i think the game will be better."
3,Game Options,"Ok, first of all, can someone who has the game tell myself and everyone else out there if this game has create a team and franchise mode? Is it better than High Heat and tp?"
4,Just As Good As Triple Play!!!!,"I am going to make this short and sweet, the baseball games on the PS2 this year are definitely below the caliber that they should be and Triple Play and All-Star were two big dissapointments to me...don't get me wrong, ASB has good graphics and gameplay but there are little things wrong in every part of the game that make you feel like your not playing a PS2 game.....First of all.....fielding is nearly impossible with some of the camera angles that they give you and it doesn't even look like they catch the ball....Those are my two major gripes about the game....Otherwise, the graphics and gameplay will make you feel like your at the ballpark......To conclude, if you want the graphics and the top quality brand name....buy Triple Play Baseball......but if you really don't care and want a very realistic baseball game to enjoy, then maybe you should check out All-Star Baseball 2002....."
5,This book will change your life.,"""Heart of a Pagan"" is an immensely inspiring work that even Ayn Rand would have loved. Bernstein offers original analogies and wholly new descriptions that put you into the moment, vividly painting a scene in which you want to be. He brings you to sweet, joyful, objective truth through subtle demonstrations and wise connections. Be prepared for greatness. Since I began reading this book, I am learning what it is to be my own hero, and why that is so essential to a happy life. The mind/body connection was never so clear, and never so important as in this book because of the fuel it gives you to be the best physical and intellectual ""speciman"" you can be. Thank you Andy!"
1,Too much,"This was a compilation of all the plots experienced mystery writers have developed more fully in individualbooks. Brutal childhood psychological trauma, child abduction, dirty sex and prostitution, police departmentdynamics, even money laundering! I started out liking the book but it became all too familiar. It lacked thefinesse of Reginald Hill or Ruth Rendell or Charles Todd or Ian Rankin."
4,SP GLove,"I got this to protect my new SP (yes, I am behind on the times) because I didn't want the top and back to get scratched. It was a little tight fitting, but once I got it in it fits perfectly and there isn't any motion restriction from the case.As one reviewer stated, the holes that allow access to charge the SP and link out aren't quite cut in the right place, so that makes it a bit difficult to get the cable in, but it does work. Apart from that, it looks and feels great and I now feel more confident about taking my SP on long trips, sure that it won't get scratched by stuff in my purse!"
2,Barbara Eden is fun to watch but otherwise not all that great,"On the one hand, the movie is an interesting time machine back to ""60's surfer flicks."" No one swears and there's barely a hint of sex going on. But it was clearly shot on a tight budget, the writing is often extra bad, and not all of the actors can act. More music would have helped and there's too much stock surfing footage used. There are however some nice location shots. The young Barbara Eden seems to be having fun in the film and her character is amusingly loopy. The other woman in the film looks like they fried her hair into platinum and her hair is gonna crack off of her head any second. Oh, the 1960's....."
3,no action,"I always wanted to see this movie because of the actors, but now that I saw it....it was boreing and fell asleep."
5,1sr one damaged,"When I received this, the case was cracked. After talking to customer service, they sent a new one and reimbursed my postage for sending the first one back. The second one was in great condition."
3,Not so horrible !!!,"I bought this CD here in Brazil for U$4,00 mainly because I watch the show in Via Funchal here in my country, as part of the same Latin America tour. The sound is no so good but is a good CD. As previously commented the vocal is horrible but in the show it appears good for me, I think that the studio operator makes a horrible work. In live the vocal voice is good, believe me, but is not comparable with Anderson (Yes)."
3,Born in East L.A.,"I was very happy with the purchase price. The only issue I have with this movie, was that towards the end of the movie when cheech and the young lady arrive in America they are married by a priest during the parade in the original movie. This section of the movie was cut out."
2,"Cheech Marin is very funny, but This movie...?","I've always liked Cheech Marin, but regretfully this movie just isn't that funny. It's an old movie, and sometimes comedy doesn't last over the years. It might have been a funny movie when it was first released, but no so now."
3,good but it was better in my souvenirs,"I saw this movie when it comes out in 79 and at that time, I was impressed. Now 30 years later it's still good but I have tho overcome cheesy dialogue and sloppy acting. The special effect still works and the conclusion is not has bad as i remembered.ideal to bath in nostalgia"
3,"Dated, but decent.","Ok so THE BLACK HOLE is not STAR WARS, but it is still a decent flick if you are not in a particularly picky mood. It has its moments-some of them wonderful-including some great effects for the time (and for Disney). The dialog is a bit of a clunker, some of the jokes are terrible, but I've heard MUCH worse. I always enjoy Max Schell-a great actor. The rest of the crew is (literally) expendable. I'll never be able to believe Anthony Hopkins going into space. That's too much of a stretch for me! However, the sets for the film are fairly convincing and certainly fun. This film is meant to be a grand adventure. I think some detractors need to loosen their belts a bit and just...r-e-l-a-x. The DVD transfer is quite good and clean. The sound is nothing to brag about. Neither are the extras for that matter. But so what. This is a nice diversion for a couple of hours."
3,"Fantastic Special Effects, not so good ending","This movie was before its time in many ways. Not only was it the FIRST Digitally Mastered Soundtrack, it was a forerunner in CG (Computer Graphics) the opening sequence (green computer matrix that ends in a spiraling Black Hole) was the first of its kind. Not even ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" released a year later attempted the use of Computer Graphics! The only drawback is the poorly done ending. Too build our interest in the Black Hole, only to show close-ups of our hero's doing flips in their ship after they enter was disappointing."
3,I was a little disappointed,"I think the only thing that earned three stars for this movie is the special effects, and maybe the musical score. The story sounded very interesting on the back of the video case, but seemed a little cheesy due to the terrible robot effects(the robots were ridiculous to say the least). The psychic also was a stupid character. Never the less I think what is so eyepopping about movies such as this and the Star Wars Trilogy(and other 70's and 80's sci-fi) is that the special effects took inagination and creativity rather than a high tech computer. You have to appreciate the time it took for early sci-fi movie makers to build the models of ships, space stations, etc. In retrospect I don't regret buying this movie I just wish I had gotten the wide screen version instead."
3,Disney Has Got to release the Soundtrack.,The Only reason why i am giving this movie 3 stars is because of composer John Barry's Marvolous score in the beginning and throughout if disney would release the soundtrack i would buy it in a heartbeat.
4,movie dvd,"bought this movie because of one of the lead actors in it and I enjoyed it, not an academy aware movie however"
3,Good Sci-Fi DVD Title Brought Down By Technical Flaw,"Early releases of this DVD are missing the front-right channel. The movie still sounds great but just get close to your front-right speaker and you'll notice the lack of sound. I've got one of these early copies from Amazon and hope to re-order an improved version. I've read on-line that the true 5.1 version has a red colored seal or mark of some kind on the back, outside cover of the case."
5,Better than the original!,"My husband and I saw this movie as we did not have the opportunity to see the play on Broadway. It so surpassed our expectations! Nathan Lane is a comic genius and the chemistry between he and Matthew Broderick is incredible! Will Farrell is hysterical (this is one of his funniest performances) and Uma Thurman is fantastic! I didn't think Zero Mostel's portrayal of Bialystock could be equalled, even by Nathan Lane, but alas, Lane proves once again that he is the best. Buy this and keep it in your DVD library....it's the new classic!"
1,Load of s**t,"Has everyone gone blind? Deaf? What is so FANTASTIC about this movie? IT BITES! And some people are stupid enough to say it's better than the original! The added sexual themes were niether necessary nor entertaining. The movie would blow without the sexual themes! At least the original was funny! Instead of finding a trace of humor in comparison to the original, I see some fat guy heaving his face into some dumb broad's jugs, and old ladies talking about ""dirty games""! ""OH,THE LAUGH OUT LOUD COMEDY!"" Where, Senator!? WHERE IS THE COMEDY!?If you want to see porn, go to some sleazy website- there are a million of them! Stop ruining good movies for your stupid fart-humor and dirty jokes!Go ahead- give this crappy flick all the stars you want, it's going to end up in the bargain-bin at Wal-Mart anyway."
2,A pale shadow of the first movie,"This must be truly great on stage, but the 80% rehash for this movie from the original movie, just does not make it. Watch the original, and see the actors make themselves history. So rehash terrible, but Uma Thurman's part was enjoyable, but did NOT really supplant the original Swedish secretary. The last 20% was the best, but a lot of that was the newness, versus real input for the viewer. Unfortunately, Mathew Broderick could NOT pull off the Gene Wilder part, the other guy Nathan Lane did NOT endear one as Zero Mostel did. Thanks, Harry!"
4,Good Production...But..............................,"This movie is really entertainig, (NOT EXCELLENT) , but still with many goodies (too slow actually) , (I prefer A gay director) But the Quality of the Dolby 5.1Sound Its REALLY BAD !... Why not On DTS??? The musicalS Must Have DTS TRACk for Real enjoin.... (like Moulin R and Chicago, they have DTS Track).... Im waiting for the Dts Version.."
1,Only Comedians should star in Comedies,"Mathew Brodderick is awful in this. Flat delivery and barely emoting anything resembling the nervous, nebbish accountant he is supposed to be portraying. It does not help that Gene Wilder was simply brilliant in the original. God what a contrast! Since MB is a central character in the movie, monochrome, bland and lifeless performance literally destroyed the movie for me. There are very few readers of this post who could not have done a better job than MB, that is how bad he is in this."
4,It's better on Broadway!,"Still a very good movie, but it's better on the actual stage. But save your money and see this version instead. It's still pretty good."
4,Ulla Dance!,"This movie is hilarious, If you like musicals. Nathan Lane & Mathew Broderick do an outstanding job in this remake of the 1968 classic. The comedic timing, and the interaction between Lane & Broderick movies this happy little movie right along. The appearances of Will Ferrell (Franz Liebkind), Uma Thurman (Ulla), and Jon Lovitz (Mr. Marks) help keep you rolling with laughter. Uma Thurman's audition scene is wonderful, not only for ""Ulla Dance!"" but for the reaction performances by Lane & Broderick. In all, a great remake of a classic. One of the few instances where the remake might just be better than the original."
5,Maverick television series,I will buy the entire series if it came out right now. This and Mission Impossible were the best things on tv in the late 50's and 60's. What's taking so long?
4,Maverick - the complete first season,"Very good sound and vision quality. The show is definite for fans and stories are interesting. Perhaps best key factor is the drama mixed with the comedy that is an interesting facet to this series.The western background enhances the storyline in most episodes and featuring the ""two brothers"" in alternative episodes also adds interest to stories."
5,Perfect for the Maverick fan,"I am enjoying these episodes as much as I did when they were originally shown on TV. I had forgotten that the first season was black & white, but I don't even notice!"
5,Hoot!,It was and still is a great show. the comedy and action mixed together create great viewing and James Garner is a hoot!!
3,Ok,"Definitely not as large as appears. Im 6'1 So I will need to bend over to use it, Im considering building a base to make it better height. Suffered a little cosmetic damage in transit, nothing that concerns me or wouldnt happen on its own. Not sturdy as some major brands such as craftsman but for the price a great deal, especially with prime. A comparable one at lowes or home depot would be about 300 + tax."
