3,"Some Really Good Stuff, but Not Enough...","This set of Droopy cartoons has finally come after years of waiting by dedicated Tex Avery fans. The cartoons are classic and for the most part hilarious.One exception to this is the fact that one of the cartoons made in the '40s was remade shot for shot in the CinemaScope format in the '50s. So you get two identical stories, where one would have been enough.My biggest bone to pick is that this set is billed as ""The Complete"" Droopy Cartoon oeuvre--but it is not. I can remember other Droopy cartoons from my youth and from TV that were not included here. Obviously, there is going to be a ""Volume Two"" in the future, and maybe more after that.I wish that they had been honest enough to state that this Collection, fine as it is, does not constitute all Droopy or other Tex Avery cartoons.Sincerely,George Littlefield"
1,Probably edited & definately incomplete without restoration,"Well, I loves these, but will have to pass. 1st, it's not the complete Tex Avery set as was released in France. 2nd, the French set was heavily edited and is missing several episodes so it wouldn't suprise me if the same was done here in a country which is far more ""PC"". 3rd, the French set wasn't restored because MGM/Turner didn't think it was cost-effective which means that it's going to be Laser Disc quality at best because that's the last time it was restored. Basically, I can't imagine that they will go to the trouble and expense it would take in order to do this right in a country which doesn't tollerate a true past (unless it's currently considered to be a plesant past). On top of that they are trying to break this down into multiple sets to soak us for more money. No thanks MGM, I'll keep my Laser Discs and enjoy ALL of the episodes in an uncut manner. Go rob some other sucker."
5,Tex Avery's Droopy - The complete Theatrical Collection,"Just love the classics, and these are never going to go out of style or get boring. My kids, who are up on what's cool and the newest and best still enjoy this and think it's funny."
3,A disappointment,"There are some classics here, but a lot of the material isn't restored and there's a bunch of awful late-period shorts not directed by Tex Avery. Give it a pass and wait for an honest Tex Avery collection."
4,It was a great book and I intend to read more from Ms. James,"I was looking for a book to keep my attention for an hour and found a book I could not put down. It is a greaty story, and the kind of book you keep around for a rainy day. This was my first Samantha James book, but certainly not my last."
4,A worthy hero,"A good hero is hard to find. However, if you a looking for a hero of depth, compassion , patience and goodness, you don't have to look any furhter than His Wicked Ways. I loved Cameron and am happy to see a writer give the heroine someone worthy of her. I have grown bored and annoyed with the ""fixer-upper"" male characters who dominate romance novels these days. Most of these other ""heroes"" are men I would not tolerate in real life and I certainly don't like wasting my time reading about them. Cameron is a man among men. Very swoon-worthy."
3,"Ok book, but it only covers retain mode direct3d with.",This is a typical OK book to read if you're a beginner. Minuses-> The author does encapsulate the direct3d objects properly and he doesn't follow the OOP principals. Which makes it almost impossible to reuse any of the code. If your a C programmer and not planning on learning C++ properly...this book is probably ok. For a C++ programmer however the way he programs just breaks way to many OOP principals (irritating to read). The book is still far from being a waste to read and buy for beginners (since there are so few books covering this topic on the market).
3,"Good story and Great characters, but the ending leaves a bit to be desired","I thought this book was pretty good...except I did not care for the ending. That being said, I don't think there was a real understanding of the Shadowrun universe. For example, while Orks and Trolls changed from human Elfs and Dwarves were born that way. One of the characters in the book is a Dwarf who changed from human. Not exactly correct, and maybe not a big deal, but irritating to me because I know how things are supposed to work. Still a good book overall.I get the feeling that this book was edited heavily, so what I don't like is most likely attributed to the editor and not the author.Nick Pollotta is of course the genius author of the Bureau 13 series, Illegal Aliens, and That Darn Squid God (amongst other greats!)."
1,Second Edition is still King.,"Bought the three 3rd Edition core rulebooks.Read and playtested them, and all I can think of to say good about these 3rd Edition Manuals(and now 3.5..lol)is that they sure are pretty, and make very good bookends to hold up your collection of 2nd Edition Material.I have been playing AD&D for 15 years and this is an awesome attempt to make money.I believe that this was WOTC primary concern in delivering this mess to the masses.It was supposed to have been playtested by over 600 people...my question to WOTC is: ""were any actual D&D players allowed to join the playtesting?"".If so how much were they paid to approve this 3rd Edition for sale?To all newbies who read this review BEWARE!!!!!!!...Search the net for the original second edition stuff and leave this alone."
4,Good look...,"If you have a yugo 59/66 then this will be a bit short but still fit just not 100% snug. I like the look of it but the quality of the pin (appears to be aluminum) and the ""anti-rattle"" clasp is something that could be a little better manufactured. It would be nice if there were two clasps for those of us with the Yugo models."
3,Interesting,"The book has some fairly interesting tips, but I am glad I purchased it at a garage sale.Shortly after starting it, I googled both Cris and Connie. Unfortunately, this skewed theway I viewed the book, as I kept taking everything Cris said/wrote with a huge grain of salt.Connie's advice was really helpful and cheerful. Sorry, Cris seems bitter and a bit of a hag.Therefore, the point of this lousy review is to warn anyone else to just READ the book, anddon't do what I did, and become predisposed to disliking one of the authors. It definitelyhad a negative impact on what's actually a pretty decent book. It's quite outdated in somerespects, being written in the 80's, but still - interesting."
2,More organization & monitoring than simplification,"This book focuses more on organizing and monitoring what you have, rather than simplifying life and getting rid of the ""stuff"" that needs to be monitored. If your problems include figuring out what holiday gifts to give the household help, this book is for you. If you're looking to make your life simpler, start by checking this book out from the library rather than buying it."
1,Not what it appears to be,"Bodum did a lot of work to make this look like an electric mokka pot. Except it's not. As mentioned in other reviews, it will not brew espresso grind. It won't brew an espresso facsimile then. This is nothing more than a small percolator, and an unreliable one at that. Two-thirds of the time it produces a lot of noise and condensation, but no coffee. Utterly worthless."
2,From ecstatic to disappointed in a few short months.,"Like another person who has reviewed this product, I found mine at TJ Maxx. About a month after purchasing it, I noticed tiny cracks near the air vents on the upper plastic body. I was never harsh or rough in my handling or cleaning of the product and followed all of the instructions and precautions. It has steadily produced more cracks over the last few months and today it completely shattered while I was rinsing it out. The temperature is just too high for this plastic. I am searching for another electric moka as I love the flavor and like to have it at my desk at work but I will definitely be getting an all metal pot instead of the clear plastic top. So far I have been unsuccessful at finding replacement parts from Bodum and after reading other reviews it looks like the warranty won't help either."
2,Doesn't stand upright,"I love the Built NY Gourmet Getaway bag I currently own, so I bought this model as a lunch bag for my son. Unfortunately, I can't get it to stand upright with a sippy cup, bottle, bento box or thermos! I can get only get this bag to lie flat. I think that lunch bags should be able to stand upright with your lunch in it, not topple over, so I'm returning this!"
4,Beautiful shoes!!,"I bought these in the Chocolate Brown in the Size 7. I bought mine at $40 from Amazon so I'm not sure why the price went up.I also agree that these run a bit big. For me, they were about a 1/2 size too big. (I would've exchanged the size if I didn't have to pay return shipping). The heel is nice and solid. They are way pointy-er then I thought they would be. The foot bedding is slightly padded. It's only something I can wear for a few hours before my feet start hurting.Overall a very beautiful shoe."
5,Great silverware set,"I've only been using this set for about a week so I can't attest to the long term durability but, so far I am impressed. The silverware is heavy but, not too heavy. No issues with dishwasher use. I am definitely happy with my purchase."
2,Such A Dissapointment,"Usually I never write reviews, but I feel like I need to tell people to save their money on this game. The 3d graphics and moves verly slowly. The game only has 4 acts and it says it has 70. You must complete the scenario part of the game to unlock the freestyle mode. The game is very repetative and boring. I though I would buy it becuase it looked like an updated version of Shrine Cirucs Tycoon, but this game is such a dissapointment."
4,Gripping Science Thriller Without Tedious Sci Babble,"I read this book on the recommendation of a friend and was glad I did. I am not big into techno thrillers, but I found this one well constructed without an inordinate amount of technical jargon to fill pages. I noted another reviewer had problems with the lack of technical, but besides people who work with bugs, who would miss it? Certainly not me, as I tend to skim endless technical explanations. I find them tedious and dull. The plot was solid with no gaping holes and the imagery created a very convincing Hawaii.I would recommend this book without reservation. It's what I term ""a good read"" and I am eager to see if Farley's next book reads as well."
5,Great Knitting Resource!,I just got this book and am very very happy with it's content. I just began knitting about 2 months ago and my interest has only continued to peak after getting this book! It's very useful for the begginer as a general reference item and the patterns in the back are great too. I can't wait to try out all the patterns.
1,Teach your self visually knitting,"To tell you the truth I was very disapointed. I tried to follow the instructions given and I was not able to start knitting. In the end, I had to find someone to teach me to start knitting.So it might be useless book."
1,There is NOTHING visual about this book!,"I just got out from the Library the new book, ""Teach Yourself Visually Knitting,"" by Sharon Turner. I expected, from the description of the book, to see detailed, step-by-step photos of the knitting basics and stitches. Instead, the book has included only *one tiny* photo of only *one part* of each step. It is IMPOSSIBLE to use these photos to learn anything. Also, the written instructions are lacking enough detail to understand what to do. And the chapters are arranged in a disorganized sequence.PS: ""Teach Yourself Visually Crocheting"" by Kim Werker & Cecily Keimis is only slightly better with the photos and written instructions, but is even more disorganized in sequence -- which is why my guess is that this is an editor/publisher problem, and not necessarily the authors' faults."
4,Great movie,Great movie that shows a whole new aspect in a war time movie.Emotional animal treatment areas but a must have to show war was hell.
2,"For Kids, Disney or Horse Lovers","If you are not one of the above listed on the review title, you might want to pass this one by.Good for some folks - boring mush for others."
4,Good Movie for Horse Lovers,"While the movie was good mainly because I am a sucker for any movies about horses, I wish it was a little more interesting. Still a good movie all in all."
3,friendship with a horse,This is a unique and fresh movie about the bond between a young man and a horse that costs his family almost everything. This is special for those who love horses.
2,Overdone -,"I watched this movie because it was directed by Spielberg. Alas, his involvement wasn't enough to salvage it. The plot was extremely implausible, from one end to another - that a poor farmer would pay so much for the horse and bid against his landlord, that a thoroughbred would be able to plow rough ground, that the horse would survive 4 years overseas during one of the world's worst wars, that it would be reunited with the lad that had raised it, that it would be bought by a French farmer who had heard it was for sale, that British and German soldiers in 'No Man's Land' cooperated to free the horse after entanglement in barbed wire, etc. And I didn't appreciate the long, drawn-out war scenes either."
4,Good movie,"Good movie. Had some interesting things in it but a bit cliche, but still not bad. Probably you'll like it better if you're a furry."
1,Bored and sticky from the sap,"If you are looking for a movie to make your twelve year old's heart swoon, and that twelve year old is really dumb, then this might be the movie for you. ICK!"
5,A Classic,This is a movie I needed to see a couple of times to appreciate. It was delivered quickly and undamaged and I am very pleased.
4,Good family movie.,"Yes, I said family. This Steven Speilberg film may not be perfect, but the acting is great both of man and horse (or horses in the case of this War Horse). It's shot in a beautiful area of England, even though it might be several locations and even if the war scenes may not be beautiful, but conversly truthful to the uglyness of war. Please ignore anyone who has rated this film with just one or two stars. I don't know what movie they saw, but it wasn't this one."
3,Not one of Spielberg's successes,"After so much hype, we were disappointed to find this movie flat and sometimes disjointed, as if it's trying too hard in parts that did not support the whole of the movie. It just doesn't have the feel of the Spielberg touch."
5,A Gift For My Dad,"I ordered this dvd as a gift for my dad. Iam like his personal assistant, so if he tells me he wants something I purchase it for him and send it to him, so when he requested this dvd of course I bought it for him.He told me that he really enjoyed this dvd.Not seeing this dvd for myself I cannot rate this with my opinion.Making my dad happy is the most important thing to me.Mission accomplished!"
1,Poor service from amazon rentals,This is the second rental from amazon and both were major disappointments. The movie kept stopping waiting for the network to download the movie. I have netflix and never experience this problem with them. I rented breaking bad from amazon and the same thing happened. It was so bad the amazon techs could not get the last episode of breaking bad to ever download. I have yet to see it.Not very happy with movie rentals from amazon. I have amazon prime and considering canceling because you cannot use all the entitlements that are suppose to come with it.Ron Brownrbrown9999@msn.com
5,Great story,Wonderful story. Will definitely watch it again. Would recommend. Kept my attention the whole story through. Very entertaining. A must see movie.
2,War Horse,We thought that this movie was a very Dark one. We also thought that it was very long for the story it was trying to convey. We are sorry that we spent the money on it. We wish there was a way to return it.
2,"Yeah, Disappointing","Very predictable movie. The only saving grace in this film is that Steven Spielberg did not decide to change the ending from a typical Hollywood ending, to a more realistic cold German ending. I won't spoil it for you, but you can guess the ending by looking at the cover of the DVD."
5,War Horse,Oh my Word !!!! I started crying the very first time the horse ran across the screen. He looked just like my Quarter Horse when I was in the Army. Wonderful Memories just started flooding back in my mind. This movie is Wonderful and I think EVERYONE should see this movie. A scene reminded me of that night during WWII; the silence of Christmas Eve; how we are all human doing what we are told; doing what we believe in. AWESOME
5,Great Movie!,I bought this movie for my mother who is a big horse lover! She loves it with all of the horses and the action you cant go wrong. This is one to buy for the horse fan's!
3,War Horse,"Moviegoers of a certain age may always remember Steven Spielberg for the indelible fingerprint he left on the 1980s, both as producer and director, and many say last year's War Horse recalls some of the best elements of that era. Based on the 1982 children's novel of the same name, which also inspired a stage production, War Horse follows the travails of a spirited horse named Joey during World War I as he is raised by a farmboy, sold off to a soldier, and marched into the middle of battle. Joey endures various hardships but endures through it all, inspiring those around him to greater things. Characterized by polished filmmaking, old-fashioned storytelling, and a certain trademark sentimentality, War Horse won many fans when it opened during the holiday season and six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. Definitely worth a look for anyone hankering for a dash of Spielbergian magic."
2,Brutal Story,For me this is a tough movie to watch. I was unable to finish it. I am a little sensitive to animal suffering. Others may enjoy this movie.
5,Ed,"I found this movie very thought provoking and emotionally moving. The special effects, Directing and acting was outstanding. I would fully reccomend this movie to anyone who cherishes the love and bond that can form between a human and any kind of animal."
5,WAR Horse,"Bought this as a gift for my aunt and mother in law, and they really enjoyed it. It was a big hit with them."
3,WAR HORSE,"FOR THE MOST PART IT WAS GOOD BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THE PICTURE WOULD GET "" STUCK"". I WOULD THEN HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE MOVIE CONTINUED."
3,It's not what I thought it would be,"I received this today and well I'm a little disappointed. It is true that most of the recipes seem easy to make and use packaged, frozen, or canned ingred. It's just well most of these recipes use things I really don't use. There might be a handful that I want to try. Another thing she uses beans in alot of the recipes. I thought it would be better. I bought a cookbook a couple of days ago I like much better called Hungry Girl Recipes. Another thing I really didn't like the layout of the recipes (I don't like 2 recipes on the same page) Just a preferance."
1,No better than my G adapter,My experience was not good with this adapter. My G adapter got better reception. good luck. If you have any wireless problems try a Megaplug - it goes through your household wiring - works better than most wireless systems.
5,Great little flashlight,Have had 2 of these for over a year now and love 'em. Carry one every where I go and really comes in handy. Had a problem with one after about 1 year (lifetime warranty). Contacted Streamlight; they gave me an address to return it to and promptly sent me a new replacement. Good product & warranty!
1,Mine didn't last.,I've owned eight Streamlight flashlights and only one still functions. My original Scorpion is still going strong after years of use as a Peace Officer. My Key-Mate quit after just a few months of intermittent use. Five of the eight Streamlights used LED's and the electronic guts in them just didn't last. Don't think I'll ever buy another Streamlight LED flashlight ever again.
5,great little light,"I bought this little light mainly as a battery consuming device. I wound up with a couple hundred AG13/ LR44 batteries since I mis-ordered once and they're so incredibly cheap from Hong Kong (yet just as good as the blister pack 2 for $3.95 at the drug store batteries). Figured this little guy would help me to burn through all those batteries before they go bad. Thing is, it doesn't eat the batteries all that fast & light output is really good for the size & price. People are constantly amazed. I carry it always. use it several times a day and have come to depend on it. Going to buy several for business gifts & give away a couple 10 packs of those batteries with them."
5,Well worth the money,"This is a great little flashlight for its size. I replaced my old key chain flashlight with this one and it blows it away. In fact I have a 12 LED flashlight and this one was brighter then that one. I have no problems with this flashlight, I read a few reviews about the thing turning on in your pocket, but I have had no issues with this. As a emergency pocket flashlight it is well worth the money."
1,Misleading,"This tribute CD is very misleading on it's info on the back cover. It claims to contain ""Stunning visuals..."". Because of the very talented musicians involved in this venture, I was expecting state of the art computer animation similar to the exellent ""Mind's Eye"" series. Instead you get the most pathetic ""visuals"" I've ever seen. The music is ok but nothing earth shattering.Try ""Live at Pompei"" or one of the 80's and 90's concert videos for a better experience."
1,TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY AND CHEAT,"Yes the music is excellent, but this is not a DVDjust a pathetic ""screen saver"" type images during musicdon't be fooled by the thieves that realese this edition...Buy the CD."
3,Solo una advertencia,"En primera el DVD no tiene ningun folleto ni una maldita imagen de los músicos que tal que ni siquiera tocan ellos pero bueno la musica es buena del 1 al 10 le doy un 8 solo a la música, las animaciones estan del nabo, mejor apaga la TV lo mejor es poder ecucharlo en 5.1 si no tienes ese sistema le quitas un 50% de su valor musical."
2,Super gentle,"I could see why people with sensitive skin would find this product beneficial. It is gentle and doesn't dry your skin out. If didn't love to wear makeup so much, I would probably rate this product higher. But as far as cleaning products off your skin, this cleanser is horrible. I have to use 2 or 3 other products to actually help me clean my skin thoroughly. It does nothing to control breakouts either. Not for people with normal/oily congested skin."
2,different,"Hard for me to get used to. It has a very thick, lotion consistency and the scent isn't that great.Doesn't lather up and tends to evaporate on the skin after a few seconds of cleansing. I only use thiswhen my skin is super dry and I need something gentle. But I usually swipe Witch Hazel onafterwards to get rid of the residue. Doesn't remove makeup - you need their oil for that.Would not purchase again. A lot better products out there. I really like the new NeutrogenaNaturals line."
2,smell like fish,After a month or so of using the filter it started to smell like fish. it made the whold hous stink.
2,"Pretty, comfy, but won't work IN the car!","I bought this item and at first, I loved it! But after three adults tried to sit in it to tighten(not at once!) and it still moves inches, and I mean inches, side to side, I became quickly uncomfortable!! I tried it in another car and had the same problem. I think it may be where the latch system comes out...there just may be too much give when it stems from the back itself, instead of the base. I really can't recommend it. I took it back."
3,"Beautiful Book, but only recipes","I was a little disappointed in this book. I was looking for tips and ideas, and the majority of the book is recipes. But if that's what you are looking for, then the book is beautifully done, and the photographs are great."
5,Balancing it out...,"I believe it's unfair that the person below gave this book 2 reviews with 0 stars (attached to a lot of drivel as well). I hope this will balance it out a little bit. Instead of listening to his incoherent ramblings, please check out the book yourself and read it with an unbiased and open heart. Even if you disagree, it's a good way to understand the other side of the debate."
5,My Dad.,"I think it was a wonderful book. I am only 14 years old and understood it. I am his son and I think his writing is excellent. His ablity for writing helps a lot, for someday I too, would like to write. The ways he portrays God and Jesus are easy to understand. I recommend his other books also, No Other Name, What About Those Who Have Not Heard, or The Openness of God. Also recommend some of Dr. Gregory Boyd's, such as God at War, Jesus Under Siege or Letters From a Skeptic. Thank you."
1,Sanders undercuts the very foundation of Christianity!,"I regret that I must put it so starkly, but The God Who Risks is a dangerous book. It is dangerous not only because Sanders forges a God who resembles the image and likeness of man, but also because he builds his argument upon artifice, misrepresentation, prejudiced and selective use of biblical texts, pejorative remarks, and historical selectivity, all intended to induce disgust toward the God Christians, from the beginning, have worshiped and to welcome the deity of ""open theism.""Anyone who will read The God Who Risks must do so with great caution, for it is a danger zone to Christian faith. It is a crucible in which one's faith in the God portrayed in the Bible will be tested. One will be strengthened or injured to the degree one rejects or heeds Sanders' siren call to put God at risk."
5,Belongs in Everyone's Kitchen,"I've always liked lentils but only recently tried green ones. They are delicious and so good for you. Makes really elegant soup combined with Italian sausage, garlic, and fennel. And that's only for starters -"
4,Love her voice,My father has been asking me to make a CD for him with Maureen McGovern Theme from Superman. He couldn't find her CD anywhere. I was so happy to find her Greatest Hits on Amazon!!! :-). the delivery was quicker than I expected also!! NICE SURPRISE!
2,Just Decent,"A decent little collection that features a talented artist with a pleasant voice.My only complaint is that I really didn't like her version of a 1964 Beatles' classic. That was and remains one of my favorite songs and I was dismayed by her rendition of it. She is not in the same league as the Beatles, who are an unrivalled, nonpareil band. The Beatles are the best!"
3,bone machine,"Ever wonder how the top-ranked reviewers force their way to the top?They vote for their own reviews over and over.So brilliant. So clever. But not ""well-done""! Certainly not the mark of a professional.Talk about the triumph of noise over signal, chaos over order, and quantity over quality!"
5,great re-issue,"the re-issue is amazing. i haven't gotten to listen to all of it yet, but so far i am digging it even more than the slanted re-issue. if you are a fan of wowee zowee, you will especially like it. wowee zowee is my personal favorite of pavement, and it has a lot of early versons of songs off that record. it also has a REM tribute song that i have only heard off of the dvd...i believe it was on the ""No Alternative"" cd. its only 15 bucks for 2 cds packed full of songs. i definatly reccomend picking it up."
5,Better than expected,The book arrived promptly and in better shape than I expected! I would definitely order from this seller again.
1,Heavy on talk...plodding plot.,"As a fan of J.A. Jance I was very disappointed. I really could not finish the book as there was so much talk and so little action or plot, I gave up on it. Oh well, she has lots of others! I wouldn't bother with this one."
3,Mediocre,"Sound quality ok and the music is enjoyable. Overall seems to lack 'content' as there's really not much in-depth explaination of the postures. There's also no background into the art of Zhan Zhuang or even introduction into what's it's all about. A good companion for the book on the subject, but doesn't really work well as a solo information source."
4,old skool,I love the recipes and the older ingredients. It's just not done this way anymore. Holiday drinks will never be the same again.
2,s'okay,"Graphics are good, story line is decent, but rainbow and heart effects are too lame.Too many characters to choose from. More options does not equal better."
2,To worder and repetitive,"Not worth buying, and you can't get higher than 5 dollars when you trade it in, because no one likes this game.The dialog goes on forever, and not much happens. When you do get into a fight ant's always the same. Very boring game."
4,Better then I expected,"When I got this game I figured it would be one of those I would pick up for an hour, then ignore it for 2 months, then come back to it again. But I have to tell you... I was pleasantly surprised. I've found myself addicted to this game... The character interactions among your main characters is priceless... had me laughing the whole way. My only complaint is the fact that in some levels you have a golem fight every time you walk 7 feet. It can be annoying when you are working on a puzzle. Other then that... this game is great. The poor ratings are undeserved."
2,Horseplayers - Life at the Track,OK but I had to struggle through it. I wouldn't recommend it for a seasoned horse player!
4,More than horse racing,"This is a great book that provides a valuable and in-depth view of horse racing, the colorful characters that frequent race tracks and how the industry operates. It takes us on a search to find the holy grail of making money in horse racing and comes up with some pretty surprising and unexpected answers.The book's audience should be far wider than just people who bet on horses, as the lessons and insights can be applied in many other areas, eg. stock trading to name just one.I thoroughly enjoyed the book and could not put it down until I had finished it -- and this from someone who has never placed a bet on a horse or been to a horse race track."
5,awesome,very much awesome with another side of awesome and a little bit of cool sprinkled on it for some flavor.
5,Great CD Great group of kids!,You've got to be impressed with the talent of this band! They write all their own music and the lead vocals are incredible. I've taken my son to see them perform and had the opportunity to meet and talk with them. Can't wait to see how far they go!
3,A LONG READ!,"I think Sharon Mitchell is an excellent author, but I found this particular book to be rather boring. There were a few good parts, but all in all, the book just dragged on. I thought it was going to focus on Monique, Gayle & Cynthia as well, but there were only a few chapters that mentioned them. I guess my main purpose of purchasing this book was because of how much I enjoyed Nothin' but the rent. I still plan on buying Sharon Mitchell's future books, but Near Perfect I'll probably never read again."
3,Too Long,"The book was long and dragged out. This is my first time reading one of her books, never again. I am glad I brought it for a few bucks and not for the full price."
4,Not Near Perfect,Near Perfect was not near what I had expected Near Perfect to be.While I did enjoy reading the story it was not near what the hype I felt when I bought it.One of the members of one of the bookclub suggested it and I was to excited to wait .One reason was the story was to drawn out and to much details given. The author did not stick to the plot in my opinion.While I thought it was better that okay I was disappointed it was not a 5* read.To be honest I would rate it 3.5 to 3.8 . Certainly more than 3* but less than 4*I can remember reading her first novel Nothing But the Rent andgiving it 5* .I have Sheer Necessity still in my tbr pile.Not a 5* but a good read.
5,Great New Early Music CD,"Both the instrumental and vocal music here are very good. This CD contains the first recording of a work by Venetus that I have been able to find. Keep an eye out for Ms. Wilkinson's work. She is young and her voice is not yet fully developed. This means that her voice quality on the next CD will be even better than it is on Fire & Ice. Expect great performances from her. She is a rising star in early music.Dr. Marion Ceruti, mezzosoprano"
3,Nice Book but Falls Short,"This book, oh, this book.To put it simply, if you have already learned the principles of design and would like to challenge your creativity, buy this.If you are just beginning in your quest of knowledge, steer clear.It is simply a book full of examples, nothing more."
3,Brings back memories but my memories are more accurate,"The premise of this book is good. There just isn't a lot of press when it comes to the monsters of the good old days (before cgi). But the problem is the author just didn't check his facts and do enough research on the subject. I got this book when I was in fourth grade. Being young and naive, I took what was in this book to be gospel. But as I got older and watched more of these wonderful old ""monster movies"", I realized just how much misinformation there is.A good example is the pictures. There are many that are mislabeled. Some actors are given as being the subject when, in fact, it's a completely different person. Another are the years listed. More often than not, the year listed is off by two or three.I give the book three stars only because it conjures up memories of Saturday late night ""scary movies"" when the actors really did act, not just scream real loud. As for content, it could have been much better."
5,Good deal clipper,Ad sounded like what I wanted after some unsatisfactory cheaper ones. It turns out I was right. The Oster is very light and cuts quickly and doesn't get hot.Yime will tell but as of now it fills the bill.
2,Obviously none of the other people commenting here are professionals,"This clipper is a big eh. It's not a ""fast feed"" at all. You have to go over the hair that you are clipping again and again, and you still risk uneven work. Anyone who loves this clipper doesn't cut hair for a living. This is the sort of a clipper that comes with a beauty school starter kit. If you want super quality, you gotta pull out the Oster big wig, the awesome classic 76!!"
2,personal use,i was especting it to cut more shorter or cleaner .i know i could not return it or exchange it to better one thtat can clean closer to the blade.
5,great,I've been shaving my head for years. I could have been saving a lot of time if I had had this clipper. Does a great job quickly.
4,Oster Professinal Fast Feed Clipper,"Great clippers, they work very well!Only complaint is the guards they come with have very sharp points! Its easy to poke someone with them, causing a painful scrape."
4,Cuts like a knife in soft butter,"Previously to purchasing this product, I used cheaper clippers that would prolong cutting of my hair via missed hairs and pulling of my hair. This clipper doesn't miss a single hair using any of the clips that come with it from 1/2"" all the way down to the blending clip. In other words, it has a nice fluid cutting action and also is very quiet compared to most clippers while doing so.Pros:- Cuts through hair easily- Very quiet compared to most clippersCon:- Clips that come with this clipper are sharp and will hurt you if the person cutting your hair isn't careful!"
2,Not a professional machine,"I thought a machine of this price and advertised as ""Professional...blah"" would indeed provide a decent service. The reality is that this machine is too slow for cutting hair and therefore the user would have to pass it through the same area more than once. It isn't design for thick hair at all, perhaps for kids' hair it might do an OK job... I've gotten better machines more a lot less money. The only thing it has as a plus, is that it is quiet... then again, probably because it is slow... :-) I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Super Quiet and Super Sharp,I love these clippers. I have two other clippers and these beat them 10 times over. They are so sharp as well as super quiet. My poodles love them too.
3,Good clips,"Not a bad clipper, quiet, painless but could trim a little closer. A bit spendy but is a decent clip."
5,Well worth the money.,"These clippers are the best I've ever purchased. They cut through hair fast and effortlessly and are relatively quiet considerng it's powerful motor. Cheap hair clippers I've purchased in the past from big retail stores ended up in the trash after maybe 10 haircuts despite taking care of them after every cut. The issues were usually sudden loud motor sound, grabbing and pulling of hair even when new, or simply not having the power necessary to clip the hair despite slow feeding through hair. None of those problems plague these clippers. Be sure to brush and oil your blades with clipper oil after every use to ensure long blade life. Don't blame the clippers for failing if you you're not taking care of them properly."
1,Very Dissappointed,"For the past several years I had been using a cheap Wahl brand hair trimmer. It got the job done, but the guards and the blades began to wear out. I decided to ""upgrade"" to a nicer model, so I purchased the ""Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade"". I trimmed my hair and beard twice with it. A few days ago, I went to trim my hair for only the third time and it would not turn on. I initially thought a breaker was blown or that the electrical receptacle was bad, so I tried a known good outlet. Nothing.Including shipping, I paid over $60 (sold by DiscountsJungle)for a product that worked less than a few weeks and cut my hair twice. Very upset and disappointed."
5,Stylist Approved,"I purchased the Oster Fast Feed Clippers after asking my amazing hair stylist friend what she uses. I wanted the best. Out of all the over-priced clippers out there, she reccommended this one for both home and salon use. My boyfriend has also enjoyed his new clippers."
5,Excellent Clipper,"This Oster is professional quality and does a great job on my buzz cut - even and clean, tons of power. Can't beat the value."
5,Good product!,I am very happy with this purchase.Finally I can do my hair cut in few minutes. This is good stuff.
2,It works ok,"Bought this for my husband last year as a Christmas gift and we've only used it a couple of times during the year, no more than 5 times I would say. Based on the reviews I expected it to be the closest thing to a professional hair clipper but that's not the case.First of all, our old and almost broken clipper cuts his hair much shorter than this one does. I thought it was going to cut really short but it doesn't. It does however, cut more effectively, I don't need to go over it as much. He also says that it doesn't ""pull"" as much or at all compared to the Wahl that he has.All in all, I wouldn't recommend it, there are other options out there that are lower priced and work just as well if not better. Also, this seller sent me a used one, I could tell because he sent me two of the same sized attachments and the clipper ""teeth"" we're extremely oiled and there was little black dots all inside the box and on the clippers which I figured was hair, my husband agreed."
5,Great investment!,I got this roughly 3 years ago so I could shave my head regularly. Still in great condition and I use it twice a month.
4,Works well,"After reading many reviews, I decided to get this one. I've been using a variety of different ones and most work pretty well. This one continues that trend. It cuts well and is easy to maintain. The only downsides is that it might get a little warmer/louder than what I remember of the others I've used and without a guard, it doesn't get quite as close as some of the other clippers. I'd recommend it for anyone who isn't looking for a really close cut."
3,Good buy for the money,This is quiet and does a good job. Not as good a job as the reviews lead me to believe but still ok.
3,Good clipper but not worth $60,"The oster fast feed is indeed a good clipper but isn't nearly worth the $60 it generally costs. If you're looking to give yourself a short buzz cut but not a skin tight one, you only have the blender guide comb as your only comb. The other 3 combs are way too large to be of any use. In terms of of quality of cutting, it's good considering that this clipper has a pivot motor. But this quality of cutting is certainly nothing out of the ordinary. Hence, for $60, you are indeed not getting your largest bang for your buck. Not when there are other solid pivot motor hair clippers around that go for around $30. One example would be the Andis speedmaster pivot motor hair clipper which is just as good but costs half the price!"
5,good series,keeps your interest and makes regular cable look lame. better series are breaking bad and covert affairs. also go rent the philly series for kicks!
5,Great show,Can not wait for the season to begin this January. The writers are on their game with the storyline.Set your DVR's.
4,Season 1 suits,"My son told me about this TV show. I loved it from the start. I started to purchase the seasons 1 episodes at amazon.It is so unique how Mike and Harvey work together.I also use I Tunes and looked there to buy each show and again i was amazed. I Tunes price $2.99 per episode.AMAZON price for the same episodes $1.99. Thanks amazon for making my money go a long way once again.Do yourself a favor try one episode of suits and I'm sure you will like it.Do one more favor don't look anywhere else for cheaper prices, amazon.com is the best!"
5,"""SUITS"" suit me","This is a clever show; love the characters, the endings are often predictable; I'm hoping they ""change it up"" a bit as time goes on. Kudos to the writers and actors for actually make me Laugh Out Loud!"
5,La Quiero en Blue Ray,Tengo varias semanas viendo esta serie por SpaceHD vivo en Santo Domingo y Realmente me encanta. me gustan los dialogos y la forma de los personajes tanto los Principales como los Secundarios donde las mujeres tienen ese don de hacer reir con sus comentarios e incognitas.La Recomiendo y La Quiero Ver en Blue Ray.
5,suits,"Great series!! Can't wait for season two dvd, all episodes are not available online-- I first saw this show on the plane."
2,Just a mediocre series,"This show should be better. Talented actors, high production value. But, the writing is just OK. Unfortunately, I think Gabriel Macht is badly miscast in this show - just not masculine and commanding enough for how his character is written. Patrick Adams is terrific, but the more they try to make him the bumbling protege of Macht's character, the lamer it gets."
4,Good series,"Not a ""must watch"" show, but it is entertaining enough to keep watching. Will watch the next seasons at my leisure"
5,Best show!!!,"I love this show, and the characters. Harvey is such a great guy, even though he likes to be a thorne in most peoples sides. But he does care, it's great how he and mike just seem to work."
2,Edited,I want an edited copy of this one. I do not like a scene. How do I obtain permission to make a copy of one? Thank you.
1,Find another alarm clock...,"The first Chaney Instruments Verve II Electric Alarm Clock I received from Amazon wouldn't keep time, so I returned it. Amazon was wonderful and sent me a new alarm clock, but this one has bugs as well. It beeps every 10 minutes for no reason. I'm just going to try to find another no frills alarm clock...hopefully I'll find one that works!"
5,"A great, fun book!","I REALLY enjoyed this book! I was actually sad when I finished it, and I can't wait for Amanda's next book! Not only are the recipes great, but Amanda's writing makes the reader feel like they are part of the action. I highly recommend it."
4,"Cutesy book, but the recipes are good.","Hesser, a food writer for the New York Times (All The News That Fits, We Print) tells the story of a courtship, with recipes. If you're in the mood for simple, sweet entertainment, this book will fill the bill.The tale hangs on entertaining and feeding her fiancé-to-be-and- eventually-husband and friends. It's light, amusing and charming but the recipes are best of all. Unlike a lot of books like this, they are delicious and really work. I especially recommend her Roquefort Balls and Chocolate Dump-It Cake."
2,Truly awful,"If you love Sex and the City, then you'll probably adore this book. If you think women obsessing about the way they look to men (or the food they eat with said men) is neither attractive nor interesting, then don't even start reading this sappy, shallow book."
4,This is Great Paper!,"I bought this in addition to the Easel set. I probably could have waited since one roll of paper did come with the Easel. It's very good quality paper...it's just that my daughter hasn't really just used a whole lot yet, especially with sometimes using both sides of the paper. Only buy if you know that your child will be drawing constantly."
2,easel paper,"It is very thin paper, it is not wide enough for easel. Would not buy that in the future.But we REALLY LIKE M&D; EASEL!! Best thing I bought for our 19 month old. It is good investment."
4,rolls of paper,Goes great w the melissa and doug easel. Make sure you order the 3 pk bundle when you order the easel because the kids go through the paper fast!
3,much needed paper for easel,"This paper was needed for my daughter's new easel. It's a big pricy, but looks like it should last awhile."
5,Very Good Video,"I have been contacting the other side for many years, and I just wanted to see the content of this video. I was surprised to find it very good. I will recommend it for people that want to learn for themselves how to contact the other side without a medium.Like anything else, people will have different levels of contact and it always will vary each session. But the basic techniques are in this video.One warning from my own expereince. Another review mentions clouds and Mr. Murray talking in the background, although only a small segment of the video, it is an important part. It is a protection, clearing meditation (prayer)that should be done before you contact the other side. If you do not do this one, Please do your own."
2,"WAY too pricey for a short, basic little tutorial.","This was ok as far as a step by step guide but DEFINITELY not worth the money. The entire DVD was about 30 minutes long and provided a very basic generic guide to contacting angels, loved ones....and although it's good for a beginner as far as explaining the concept of channeling and the terms, it is not the only way But I was shocked that the reviews were so outstanding for what was a VERY short, very basic little tutorial. I definitely do NOT recommend this-for the price. Pricing it at $10.00 or even less would have been more than fair for this DVD."
3,Hold great... Until it snaps off,"I've bought two of these before and the same thing happens to them. While wearing it on your waist, if you hut it just right, the tab on the top holding the phone on snaps and the phone falls out. I was tempted to buy a 3rd, but then thought, there has to be a better design. Both of mine lasted about 4 months each and I would not consider myself to be abuse to this product.I would epect it to hold up better."
2,Kentucky Bride,thank you for this wonderful gift. This will make a great and wonderful gift family/ friend enjoyed and will enjoy reading
4,"Only Covers the OT& NT, Not the Apocrypha/Deuterocanonicals","This seems to be the only complete concordance for the TEV/Good-News-Bible; as this version constitutes a very good translation in idiomatic non-ponderous English, the concordance represents a scholar an essential tool for use in conjunction with the TEV.I am Anglican/Episcopal-tradition. While there are editions of the Good News Bible with Apocrypha/Deuterocanonicals, it does not appear that a concordance for this ""middle part"" of the TEV has been produced. However, for Protestants especially who hold to only the OT from the Hebrew/Aramaic original as well as the NT in Greek, this trimmer concordance is far more asset than liability."
2,Slapdash and disappointing,"This book combines a book of days with an address book (that allows only 11/16"" to write in 'name/address/phone/email', a birthday card/gift record, a holiday list (whose pages are the same as the b'day card/gift record), and a few pages for 'notes'. The typography is uninspired, the layout looks like an afterthought. For keeping track of birthdays (which is what I wanted to do in the first place), I recommend Sally Fox's 'Medieval Woman: Illuminated Book of Days'. Better production, higher quality, and (I believe) cheaper."
3,it's ok.,I guess this shows that they milked the character as much as they could. it was kind of lame but my kids loved it.
1,"Poor instructions/pictures, and bad patterns","I am a little more advanced than a beginner - I started out using YouTube vidoes, and then checked this book out from the library to try out some patterns for granny patches. The 2 patterns that I have tried to use from this book just do NOT work. The one granny patch was so lumpy and deformed from trying to fit too many stitches into too small a space that I ended up completely redoing the work with fewer stitches and guessing along the way as to what would work.The next patch I tried required creating a ring using a loop. The instructions for creating the ring are very poorly written, the pictures don't match what the instructions say, and they completely skip the critical points in chaining onto the loop. I returned to YouTube for some videos, and the methods I found look nothing like what this book shows.I won't bother to attempt to use this book for anything else."
5,Great Crochet Reference!,"I bought this book a few weeks ago, because I wanted to start crocheting again. It has been about ten years since I've done it and this book was a great reference for re-learning. The pictures are wonderful, they show exactly how to do each stitch. I go back to this book constantly when I am reading patterns from other books that don't explain how to do a certain technique. I would definitely recommend this book for beginners and those wanting to relearn!"
2,Not very visual!,I think this book needed to be more inclusive with their visuals. I wasn't doing the stitching right until my grandma showed me how to do it right. I doubt i would have been able to learn just from this book. It jumps around a lot too.
2,Photos are useless,"Hmm, I disagree with most of the reviews for this book. I thought the photos were small and all looked the same -- I got absolutely nothing useful from them. Additionally, this book glosses over some of the key things for many projects: turning and starting in a round. I felt like I learned these stitches in spite of this book, as opposed to because of it. Looking through ""Crocheting for Dummies"" it looks like it would be much better by showing clear diagrams instead of photos and spending more time on things like when and how to turn, and what each stitch should look like."
2,Save your cash,The format does not work well for this. Huge yarn and large hooks negate the delicacy of what crochet can be. The projects are ugly and I would not want to learn from this book. Waste of good money
5,Logical layout and covers technique and tips that are hidden or missing,"in other crochet books. And I have many crochet books. This really is a beginner book as well as for advanced crocheters that covers Everything that a new crocheter needs to know. I'm a two year crocheter.With the large photos you can locate what you want to learn, even when you don't know the name.I bought this to help my grandson/s learn how to crochet. The yarn used is light colored wrapped yarn (like corded shoelaces) so all stitches are easy to see. I discovered stitches and techniques from beginning to finishing that you can find in online videos, but that uses a lot of usage GBs.With this I can teach the basics to advanced and I and grandson/s can get beautiful results without fail."
1,Not what I expected,"Too small to be a dream book. No information to help me decorate or build a cottage. ""Nothing to see here."" Disappointing."
2,Poor design.,"After reading the few reviews I saw on here I thought this would be the armband that would do it for me. Boy was I wrong. The design of this armband is absolutely atrocious. I like the velcro strap but the fact that you put your ipod in a rubbercase that can easily slide out is a joke. I put the ipod into the rubbercase and slid it into the holding area on the armband. I then simulated a running motion and watched my ipod gradually slide out of the holding area. No I wasn't simulating a full sprint, but rather a jog. I could tell if I was at the gym and just walking around, I would hear a crack and see my ipod on the floor. Maybe mine was defective but there is absolutely no stability when the ipod is in the holding area of the armband I purchased. I am very disappointed in this purchase and will be looking for a new armband. By the way I own the 30G Ipod Video. Shipping was spot on so kudos for that."
3,good,"Pretty nice little bench for the money. Much better than I thought it would be. Difficult to put together. Item was damaged during shipping but, I got a replacement piece in about a month. A little longer than I would have hoped for."
2,not thrilled,"I wasn't thrilled with this product. The box it was in was quite flimsy and so was split open on arrival. It wasn't packaged very well (not very much protective material inside surrounding wood) and so where the box had split, the wood was all scratched up. When I was putting it together, I had to ""force"" one of the slats of wood to align.Now all that being said, I did not contact the company for a replacement...which I'm sure they would have done for me."
4,"Awesome 5 star camera, but beware the rebate co.'s scam","I have nothing but good things to say about this camera; every good thing in the other reviews is true. I literally have no complaints, except when it comes to the company Canon outsourced to facilitate the rebates. I was denied my rebate twice, having been lied to by the company, saying I missed the postmark deadline. I did certified mail, baby. They got their date wrong and denied me, but with persistence, and overwhelming evidence, they sent me a check, but would not provide info on where they got their (fake) date wrong.So, beware, and send certified for rebates. And Canon, shame on you for having a crap company like Rebates HQ do your rebates!This camera, by the way, is a dream. It's lens makes me tingle. It's the best camcorder I've ever used, and as a filmmaker, I've used quite a few.Oh, and as with ALL camcorders, don't use the camera mic if you care about sound. Seriously now."
2,(Planetside 2) Older PC's need not apply,"Don't be fooled. Unless you have a high end cpu and graphics card this game is a lesson in frustration. And the typical response from other players.....""Just upgrade"". Yes, that is easy on daddy's credit card, but in the world of jobs and bills most of us cannot slap down a few hundred bucks for the sake of one game. Even if you meet minimum specs this game will not run, not even at its 'minimum' level. I tried for weeks to make this game work on an Nvidia 9800gt and a Quad 2ghz processor and even with the tectures and effects on low and the rest of the settings off totally this game could not give me more than 20 frames per second in a pitched battle. Most of the time they even dropped as low as below 10 or even 5. No matter how you tweak the User Option.ini file, no matter what you do this game will not run properly.This game is a graphics hog that can only run on the most up to date rigs. Spare yourself the frustration I went through."
4,glad I found it!,My MixMaster come with only the larger bowl but I need the smaller as well. It's just what I need & arrived quickly
4,If the demo is anything to go by...,"This game is fun.I enjoyed the original Tropico and the expansion. This game is simpler, easier to get into, though the Demo does not let you know everything you will be able to do in the full game.It's not suitable for younger kids, however, as the theme is more Piratey than Pirates of the Carribean (though that used to be a bit more risque, itself). Wenching and lynching are part of the game, and pirates like anarchy, which is provided by sordid amusements. Very appropriate for the time period and topic, but it still limits the kids who ought to be playing it.Try the Demo (warning it's 130 megabytes so no dial-up), it's the best way to find out if you agree with me."
2,Fun but gets old,When I bought this game I was like cool its a game about a pirate controlling an island. Its got ok graphics. I never played the original Tropico so I couldn't tell you the differences. I played the game for about 5 hours. The only exciting part I found was sending the ships out to raid areas (when i played there was only one place to raid) Funny thing is they would never run out of people or be smart enought to move to another place (means not realistic). You would never see these raids. If you build too fast you would run out of captives. Very annoying. The whole fear thing on the captives doesn't mean anything. I never lost one captive. You could buy it or not its up to you!
5,great walking shoes,"I got these shoes just in time for the trip to Universal Studio. They were very comfortable and was a perfect fit. I love them and would order another pair at a heartbeat. The price is great ($29.89) even with the extra delivery charge, it's well worthed."
1,the on-going fall of o'reilly,"I can't pinpoint exactly what it is that I do not like about ""Linux in a Nutshell"". Basically, it seems that everytime that I need a bit of information the book does not have what I need. I also dislike the organization of the book. I've had it for 2 or more years and it still just doesn't give me the good use that most other O'Reilly books do.Basically, it's not a must-have and I'd gladly trade it back in for the money I shelled out for it.This book continues the fall from grace of O'Reilly & Associates. Once *the* best computer publisher but now - starting to have more misses than hits (where before EVERY O'Reilly book was almost guaranteeded to be worth every penny paid."
1,Glad I Only Purchased One!,Clothe's have a very strange smell when they come out of the dryer not a light citrus as the description claims and not even close to lemon. I've never smelled citrus quite like this. It's more of a spicy scent and the clothes smell nothing like the softner. I wanted to try the Geranium also but now I'm not so sure.......
3,m16a4,this airsoft gun is poor qaulity and should be used by begginers.Pros:good fpsnice sitesCons:lightpoor plasticcheap qualitysingle shotIf you are a begginer and are looking for a cheap gun this will fit you.
4,Great to use as a prop,"I use it as a prop in my action films, it looks realistic. It came with alot more things then i thought it would! If you want to use it actuality use it as a air-soft gun to shoot, dont a buy one on amazon there are many great air-soft websites that sell them."
1,I felt bad that my son used his gift card for this item,"This gun never fired well, or accurately, it was cheap with horrible instructions, there was a strap with two hooks and only one attachment spot on the gun so carrying it was a nightmare"
5,Wow! Buy it if you want to lose weight! It works!,"I have been watching this video every three days and listening to the audiotape every other day. A remarkable thing just happened to me about a minute ago! My kids were eating DQ for lunch and I took a bite of the Snickers Blizzard. It tasted horrible! I couldn't even swallow it! Snickers Blizzard has been my ultimate favorite treat since I got my first job working at a DQ 16 yrs. ago. After three weeks of following this program I have lost 12 lbs. and I couldn't handle my favorite treat! I am a firm believer in this program now and will recommend this program to everybody I know! - friends, family, clients, strangers...EVERY body!"
1,THIS COMPANY SUCKS!!!!,"If you need this item quickly, FORGET ABOUT IT. Even with ""expedited shipping"" (1 to 3 days) it will take more than a week for you to get it. I placed the order on a Thursday, and needed the tape for a major project that was due the following Tuesday. It's Friday now and I still haven't received it. I don't know if the product is any good because I didn't get the damn thing. If I could give this company -10 stars or more, I would. Rest assured, I will be asking for a refund for the so called ""expedited shipping"". Fortunately I found a local source that had something similar.Addendum:After complaining about this incident to grafstick, they not only refunded my ""expidited shipping"", but they refunded all my money and allowed me to keep my order as a gift. Although I still haven't recieved it to this day and it's been over a week since I've needed it. For this, I'll give them one more star for okay service."
4,2 Great Movies,I love both these films. I chose a four star instead of a five because the 2 movies were on one disc. I would still recommend business with these folks.
2,A step backwards from the original Braun PocketTwist,"Am I the only one who thinks the new Braun pocket travel shaver is inferior to the old Braun Pocket Twist model?!?!?! the shave is not as close.I saw this new model in Hong Kong while traveling on business. I thought what the heck I've had the older model for a few years now and its time to get the newer, more modern looking unit. I used the old unit (which I've had 3 of them over 12+ years) and left it on the bathroom counter on purpose as I checked out. Flew home to the USA, opened the new packaged unit and tried it. Boy, what a disappointment. At that moment I was hoping I had packed the old unit in my toiletry kit when I checked out of the hotel."
1,"Ghetto, cheap, and hurt my face!","It might just be because I have sensitive skin, but this thing seriously hurt my face! It was like sharp cutting or something. Very cheap and crappy!"
3,shaver,I purchased this for my Marine Corps son to use in the field while stationed in Afghanistan. Received the shaver in the mail quickly and appeared to be as advertised.
4,Braun shaver,"Works good for a battery powered back-and-forth shaver. I prefer a rotorary action in my shaver, but this inexpensive Chinese shaver is good for travel. Brush in handle is nice touch."
3,"Not bad, but not great...","It's a good little shaver if you only have a day or two's growth (depending on your facial hair of course). I have a reasonably thick growth, and found that anything after a day was impossible to remove consistently with this shaver (hence, I would always used my razor blade). Otherwise I really like the shaver for the cost and the way it stores.I'm glad to have purchased it, but unfortunately it really is only good for a quick clean-up of a relatively short growth. The trimmer is virtually useless because it is awkward to open, awkward to close, and very awkward to use!I guess they say that you get waht you pay for, and I think that is true in this case. So being realistic, it only cost $15."
5,GREAT LITTL RAZON,I had a good experience. It is elegantly designed with an integral cover and switch protector. Impossible to inadvertly turn on in your luggage. And it provides a close shave. A good backup when you are in the car or traveling abroad.
3,Doesn't work well for me,"This is a nice little shaver and had great features. I find that I have to go over and over in order to get a close shave which causes burns. It's great for emergency to get things in control, but I use razors as my everyday."
3,"Just calm down, people...","This shaver is.......ok. That's the best that can be said about it. It's only ""amazing"", etc. if you don't mind spending about 20 minutes with it while it tries again and again to cut the same few hairs over and over and over. I could shave with a razor and shaving cream three or four times while this things tries to get the job done. It's fine if you just want to control the stubble a bit but if you need a clean, proper shave you will not get it with this."
1,Amazon buyer beware,"I purchased one of these in early October. When it arrived it would not work at all in spite of trying numerous batteries. I contacted Amazon asking for a replacement. I subsequently received an email from Amazon saying ""For health and safety reasons, we don't want the original item back, so please dispose of it at your convenience."" Now, three weeks later, Amazon has sent me another email saying that if I don't return the defective shaver they are going to charge my account. First they tell me to throw it away and then they tell me to return it three weeks later. How can I return it if I've thrown it away? What kind of game is this? Buyer beware."
1,Horrible Razor - doesn't even work,"This razor is completely awful. The actual razor doesn't cut/trim any hair at all. Only the very small ""trimmer"" attachment works, and is in such an awkward position on the razor that it is hardly angled to do a proper job. Don't waste your money on this razor; instead of spending $20 on this, spend $40 on a much better one."
5,Great for travel,"Not often am I pleasently surprised by an item at the low end of the cost scale, but this one hits the mark. It shaves as well as a razor 10 times it price, is easy to use, easy to clean and all in all a best buy.If you are already using an electic razor there is no period of adjustment. If you are in the market for a cheap travel razor, this is it."
3,Kindle edition does not have interactive table of contents,"I enjoy McCullers' writing, but this Kindle edition is disappointing. The table of contents is not interactive,which means that the only way to get to a given story is by clicking through to it from the beginning of the book - a real nuisance!"
3,Depressing themes emerge,"I'm not a fan of the open-ended short story, being a tale that is redolent with symbolism that I'm certain is there but just don't ""get."" Unfortunately McCullers' tales seem to fall into this category so I was not terribly thrilled with the stories. However, as a body of work they were interesting--the themes of lost childhood, changing sibling relationships, disgruntled musical prodigies, and general loneliness / rejection emerge and give a nice sense of continuity to the works. The inclusion of two of her novellas is nice; I appreciate the longer story format for the ability to get to know the characters and setting a little better.Overall I'd recommend picking up McCullers' novellas and if you're thrilled with those, tackle her short stories."
2,Author goes wide but not deep,The author's lack of business experience shows in this effort. He needs to actually try starting a business rather than just writing about it.
2,Bobby Goldsboro / All Time Greatest Hits,"I bought this Cd for three songs and that's about all I like. I know it's a classic but maybe too classic for my taste. ""Honey"", ""Watching Scotty Grow"" and ""And I love You So"", is about it, out of 10 songs. I'll take the three songs and cut my losses. You had better be a big fan to enjoy them all."
5,More than I expected,"I ordered this book for my husband because he wanted a guide for identifying trees in our area. He camps and hikes and studies all things related to what he does. He was astounded with the thorough information in the book. It was definitely more than he expected! I work in print and graphics, so I have high standards for print appearance and I was very impressed with the quality and the detail of the photos in the book. The cover/binding was also sturdy... making it tough enough to easily withstand many hiking trips with my husband."
3,There is a better book,"If you live north of a line from Virginia to Northern California get Trees of Northern United States and Canada by John Farrar: a) Superior Bark Photographs - bark at different ages when necessary, full trunk shown b) Line drawings leaf, bud and flower (supplemented with color photos when necessary). c) Key guides for both summer and winter identification. d) Everything on one page. This book is the result of over 40 years by the Canadian Forest Service."
1,....,The book establish the way we learn but does not help us improve it. Studytips should be searced somewhere else.
4,OVER THE TOP,"Slightly over the top, but moves in the right direction! Has this been screened on Australian television? If not, it should be!"
1,Didn't Utah win and win big?,"The publishers of this DVD need to know that by creating a product that features only 1 of the 2 teams and worse yet featuring the looser, noone will buy this. No Utah fan will touch it because of this serious snub. Alabama fans won't buy it because they looked pretty bad. I hope the publishers eat it.gh"
2,Hieroglyphs,"My third grade class was learning about Ancient Egypt. Last year several classes worked together, we used a stamp kit from another teacher which looked very similar to the one I purchased. The students stamped names in air-dry clay. Later they painted the hieroglyphics. The results were beautiful. The students enjoyed a fun,hands-on project. I purchased this kit and I am very disappointed. The hieroglyphics are tiny, they are too small to see in clay or paint. We stamped them on paper first, very unimpressive. The other version must have been older as it had much larger figures. It's a great idea but I would not buy this kit it just does not work."
2,Should be abridged.,"Waller has written two or three different stories that don't work together. The romance runs into fantasy, then political bad guys, throw in an eco-terrorist. Then the author tries to nicely wrap us all back up in romance. This book is only enjoyable if severely abridged, if I may offer a pun. Then maybe you can swallow it whole and quickly, if at all."
5,Worth it's weight in gold.,"Having seen this driver in action and having read the reviews, I purchased this with high expectations...it has lived up to those expectations. I was fed up with stripped screws using my cordless drill and I wanted something that would eliminate that problem. I needed to put up some temporary staging/scaffolding (consisting of 2x4's and 3/4"" plywood)in my great room in order to hang a pool table light above a pool table that I did not want to move. The ceiling height was 13' and I wanted to make something sturdy. This driver easily put 3"" screws in without stripping a single one. I was also able to easily hold the driver over my head to screw as well. After the light was installed and I needed to break down the staging, it removed all screws painlessly and all lumber and screws can be re-used. Ready for the next project! Absolutely a five star rating!!!"
5,Great Driver,"The Makita 18V Impact Driver is a great tool. It is compact and light weight. It drives 3"" screws with ease. I puchased it about 3 weeks ago. My only complaint is that it didn't come with a belt clip. The lithium-ion batteries are a big plus. They charge in about 15 minutes."
5,Makita impact drill,"We had new siding installed on a large 2-story home. The crew used thousands of screws, and this drill. They loved it & recommended it, so I ordered one. I used it to help out on the new deck, very comfortable to use, and more power & torque than I expected. And, it's light enough to use just about anywhere I need a screw driver around the house. The LED light helps more than I expected too. I'm getting two more sets for my kid for Xmas."
2,Picky on bits,The product works fine as long as you don't insert the wrong driver bits. If you read other reviews you will find the same problem. You will not be able to dislodge the bit if it gets stuck without tearing apart the impact driver. Apparently the tool is very picky about the driver bits it will accept.
5,Love this tool!,"This impact driver is reasonably priced. Very lightweight. Very well balanced. Super fast battery charging. Nice belt hook. Very convenient LED light. And while it might feel like one of your kid's Fisher-Price toys in your hands, believe this bad boy has got some serious set of balls! Don't be afraid to make the purchase. You won't regret it."
4,A good album,"There are a few Darin compilations that have the annoying feature of not telling you certain songs are live...this is one of them. Mack the Knife and If I Were a Carpenter are not the studio originals. If you're just looking for an album with Mack the Knife, look elsewhere because this live version doesn't even come close to the original. But, if you're looking for a unique mixed bag collection of Darin songs, this really isn't bad.There are the original studio versions of a few early Darin rock n' roll songs like Splish Splash, Dream Lover, etc. His version of La Bamba is great, very unlike the original rock classic. Blue Monday is a catchy song with a good vocal performance. His slow and beautiful Fly Me To the Moon is also wonderful. But the highlight of this set for me is the live version of If I Were a Carpenter...also very different from the original, it is much slower, and contains some terrific acoustic guitar work and a lovely flute solo. I actually prefer it to the original."
1,Disappointing.,"I bought the CD for one reason, to get the song Mac the Knife only to find that it was a live version (which is stated no where on the albume or upon reviewing the song list during purchase). The live version just doesn't match up to the actual original, far from it!"
4,High Quality. Durable,"Since we began caring for an ""outside"" cat last fall, I've been looking for something like this. While our winters in Florida aren't cold, they can get chilly. This unit is good-sized, fully insulated, and carpeted. Works well to shelter her from draughts. It holds the cat's bed with room to spare. Priced competitively, and the seller offered free shipping."
4,Good Condo,"We have a stray cat that adopted us. Must keep him outside due to our cat. The Kitty Condo works great for our adopted outside cat. We live in Pennsylvania, and the westher is a factor. Our condo held up wvry good during the first ice storm. The only downside is..the opening is a bit too large. Other than that, I highly recommend the kitty condo"
2,Not as insulated as I wanted,"The condo doesn't stay any warmer than the outside temperature and even with the optional door flap, a lot of condensation develops inside, so any kind of pad you place inside will feel damp during wet weather. Before I bought the door flap, the design allowed rain to fall in the front getting the carpet wet."
4,Patmate cat condos,"They're nice, but two out of my 6 cats don't care about them, they just won't go inside. To extend the condo and protect the cat from the rain, wind and snow, plase the outdoor rubber/carpet rug on top of the entrance, with ends hanging down to the floor or the ground (rubber side - up, carpet - down). It's not too beautiful, but very functional. Actually it's even better then the door. It works even nicer with my medium Dogloo Indigo dog homes, which I use for my cats."
3,Lite done Right!,"Not as good as Todd's other books, this book takes great recipes and makes light, low-fat recipes out of 'em. get the other books first -THEY are GREAT!"
2,A Bit Dissapointed in Quality,"one saucer came without a pattern.....i was dissapointed...i would have thought someone would have checked plates before shipping.....it was a present for my daughter.....thankfully she thought it was not such a big deal and is calling it the ""lucky"" plate"
4,Decent reference book,Got it for my algorithms class. I'm not the best student so don't take my word for this to the letter. I actually find this book very informative. Helps me a lot to keep up in class. Now I can ask questions that doesn't make me look like an idiot. But to be honest I can't sit down and read the book for an hour. It's a tad bit on the boring side. still good book regardless
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"A.I. is quite possibly the strangest and most disturbing movie I've ever seen. The special effects and the teddy bear were cool as hell, but the whole story was just freaking creepy."
3,A Patchwork Alphabet,"I thought it would be a book showing different ways of making alphabet letter blocks. It wasn't what I expected, but the ideas are good."
5,Good deal. I keep it with my postage stamps.,Folds up for easy storage. Good quality. Simple and accurate. Easy to learn how to use. US and Metric weights.
2,Not for a chewer,"The only reason why I purchased this toy for my puppy is b/c it was cheap, less than a dollar at the time of purchase. My ShihPoo ripped it up. It didn't last that long at all. I watched her when I first gave it to her but after the second time in her mouth I had to throw it away. The white stuff was all over the place. If you have a chewer please don't get this toy."
2,Never received the product.,"This wax was available on Amazon website, so I bought it. But I never received the product. I was told this exact wax was out of stock. So I really can't rate the product, but I can rate the seller, Cosmetic Solutions. Not so good..."
4,"Not for kids, a useful little round-up to get you started","This is a book for adults, not children. Short, to the point, containing exercises and advice for weight-training beginners."
1,"Riddled with typos, grammatical errors, and bad translations","This book should never have left the printer's, as it is full of errors of every imaginable variety. For example, in Lesson 23, two of the exercise answers are clearly wrong:""Have we earned a lot of money yet?"" is translated as ""¿Ha ganado mucho dinero ya,"" which means ""has he earned...""""Have they visited their mother-in-law yet"" is translated as ""Ha visitado a su suegra ya?,"" again turning the subject into ""he""That's to say nothing of another sentence that the reader is supposed to translate: ""¿Ha pegado ya a su mujer?"" That means ""has he beaten his wife yet?""In the same chapter's vocabulary list, the word ""paliza"" is defined as a ""spank,"" when it actually means ""a beating."" Elsewhere, irregular verbs are conjugated incorrectly, with extra letters showing up in odd places.Unless you're prepared to double-check everything in this book against a dictionary or book of verb conjugations, you should spend your money elsewhere."
1,This book is messed up.,"I went to lesson 32 to have a look at the things I'd be able to say when I was done with this book.Some of the translations:--If you don't undress, I will beat you. (p.156)--He's a fairy and his sister is a hooker. (p.158)--She's not really a hooker but only a liberated woman (p. 140)Looks like someone's got issues."
1,Does NOT work on Mac,the specs say that it is windows/mac compatible. what it should specify is that it requires MAC OSX in classic mode. Very disappointed. My daughter plays similar titles at the babysitter's house and was so excited to play it at home. but i guess i would need an older PC to make this happen. Description should be updated to reflect what is needed to run this software successfully.
1,Stay far far away,"This game isn't worth one red cent. It gives turn based strategy games a bad rap when they need positivity the most.If your entertaining the thought of getting this game, please don't."
3,It's Not 'On',"This release has about 5 reasonably decent songs. They're still in the same style and melodic manner as their debut 'On', but the songs aren't as catchy. They sound more like B-Sides and filler rather than hits unlike the debut where every song smoked, but 'Quick Turns' is still worth listening to if you're a fan of their 'On'."
3,A wrench is a wrench,"Its an adjustable wrench, whats to rate here. Stanley has decent products maybe not the best out there but they will do in a pinch."
5,Bluegrass for everyone,"Gave this as a Father's Day gift. It's so difficult to find presents for dads that don't involve sports, grilling, beer, or cars! This was just right for my bluegrass-loving dad, although he's very selective about the types of bluegrass he likes. In addition to solid, whompin', fired-up 'banjer' runs that are feats of human dexterity, he appreciates the instrumentals that show off the beauty of the music genre. From the contents to the cover, this is beautiful, peaceful. He loves it, as does my mother (who more often grins and bears than appreciates bluegrass).This transports you to a green mountainside, complete with birds singing. You can picture yourself in that rocking chair on that porch, smiling, without a care in the world."
4,I enjoyed Home Again by Kristin Hannah very much!,"I chose this rating because I enjoyed reading the book. The characters were very charismatic and addressed ""real life"" issues. There were a few misspelled words which is why I will not give it 5 stars. However, this is the first book I've read by Kristin Hannah and I will definitely read more of her books and will definitely recommend her to others."
5,Good read,"A different topic, story line flood, kept my interest. I like this author and have read many of her books is why I chose it"
1,Not a single sympathetic character in the bunch,"She's a good writer, but I couldn't stand how the main characters were all basically in a holding pattern for sixteen years -- the ""hero"" being a self-destructive, selfish hedonistic jerk and the heroine a total martyr, just like the brother -- until the so-called hero returned to his hometown. I felt like giving everyone a good smack upside the head for being so emotionally-stunted.I enjoyed her book ""Comfort and Joy"" but this one I almost couldn't bring myself to bother finishing."
5,Loved it!,"In my personal opinion, Kristin Hannah is one of my favorite authors. This was an excellent book and I would highly recommend it to anyone. If you have never read any of Kristin Hannah's books, you are in for a treat."
3,enjoyable but sometimes too pat/ not believeable,"This book was a fun read but was a bit predictable, pat, cliched, and sometimes unbelieveable. Not Hannah's best for sure."
1,Plastic gearing failed.,"Purchased to shave my head with, not a fan of razors. I went with this because it's what the barber uses. I have lubricated the blade and cleaned the trimmer as directed. It will turn on, but the blade does not move. So i took the blade off, couldn't see anything jammed in there or anything. I opened the front plate which allows you to see the internal workings. You can see the gearing that is attached to the screw drive is not metal. Not sure what it is made of, but the teeth are all mushed. I was halfway through my trimming when this happened. This trimmer has run for a max 3 hours. I didn't hear any whining noise and the blade wasn't on too tight. Brought it too the barber and he just looked at me and said, ""You got your money's worth in hair cuts!"" Which made me happy, I will be seeing a lot more of him now."
2,Highly Over Rated,"I was very disappointed with this DVD, especially for the price I paid for it. I guess if you have never practiced yoga before it might be okay but if you have had good teachers or are a teacher yourself, save your money. This is hardly a challenging session."
2,"Good info. maybe outdated, too technical for average reader","It appears that some of the research in this book is older-not the most recent findings available. I was hoping this would provide a user friendly presentation of back disorders found in the population today and applicable evidence. I am somewhat familiar with anatomy from both Pilates and Yoga training but still didn't get a lot from this book. The studies showed pictures and older equipment, the material may be beneficial for some but a warning to the general population just hoping to learn more about their own body/injury and prevention or rehabilitation exercises-not that promising from my perspective. Obviously I am not a medical professional but I do think this book would be more valuable to someone with anatomy experience."
5,Great Star Wars Book,This was one of the best Star Wars books ever made.It is a great book to start at in the X-wing series. It has many plot twists and the characters become refined. The best part is when the super-class star destroyer breaks free of Coruscant. The book is very suspenseful and begins at a funeral for someone who isn't dead.The book spotlights on Corran Horn and his escape from Lusankya(or THE Lusankya).Even though it starts with a funeral it ends on a highnote.P.S.-I rarely give five stars
4,Great book.......JUST A DARN TRIAL!!!!!!!! ARGGGG!!!,"It was a great book.....awsome battles in space AND ground, great when Corran is on the SSD, great elsewear, but there was just one mistake by Stackpole:HE MADE THE DARN TRIAL OVER TYCHO SO BORING!!!!!But, very good."
4,An unpredictable ending !!!,"The Krytos Trap was a good book however that trial was well... annoying. Other than that the book is facinating. It has an excellent ending very surprising, Luke also ha a cameo appeareanc.Some key things also happen to Corran that will help when reading I, Jedi.stackpole really did a good job with this book"
4,"Change in Style, Still a Good Read","I'll admit I was anxious to see more of the main characters. I mean they left some seriously large loose ends at the finish of the third book. I believe that was purposeful, painful, but deliberate.The switch to Marcus and Miryam's story was jarring to me. I'm more of a modern historical fiction fan. It was also a switch b/c the first 3 books in this series were very action driven, now all of a sudden we're in first century soap opera territory.As usual, the Thoenes do an excellent job of the writing and storytelling. I wouldn't call this book my favorite Thoene contribution to society, but it wasn't horrible. It also sets up the next one nicely. Honestly though, this and book 5 of the series could have been a separate duology altogether...I believe they were lumped in with the Zion Legacy as a cheap marketing gimic that worked."
5,"In the spirit of ""Dead poet society"" or ""Matrix""","Many thanks, Mr Morris, for this remarkable book. I consider it to be in the spirit of ""Dead poet society"", as far as teacher/students relationships are concerned. But it goes infinitely deeper as far as the teaching is concerned. It helps readers reconsider their thinking, their beliefs, their values. It helps them come out of the social ""Matrix"". French philosopher Pascal said : ""Misfortune to the man who, at least once in his life, did not question everything."" Mr Morris helps his students and readers to start this kind of questioning."
5,Simply The Best,"I spent 28 years in the Navy with 9 of them on Oahu and Kauai plus another 20 return visits and alls I can say is Franko's maps of the Hawaiian Islands are the best thing since sliced bread, in fact I found places I didn't even know existed. So if your renting a car and want to find the best beaches and snorkeling spots and other places of interest on any of the Hawaiian Islands do yourself a favor and buy Frank's detailed maps and forget about the useless guide books that Frommers sells."
4,Good versus Evil,"I am a huge Maggie Shayne fan and consider her to be the ""Queen of Paranormal"". Ms. Shayne's unique style of writing will keep you spellbound from start to finish. I read this novel in one day which I hated doing but couldn't seem to stop myself. Destiny, the story of two immoral high witches, Nidaba and Eannatum, was an interesting journey to the dark side. Imagine finding the one you loved and lost after four thousand years and once again it seems just like the first time (a love of a lifetime). This was an extremely powerful love story filled with deceit and betrayal. Although I enjoyed Destiny, it does not surpass its counterparts, Eternity and Infinity, but you will find it to be an entertaining reading experience. I anxiously await the next installation ""Immorality "" due out in fall, as I remain a devoted Maggie Shayne fan."
5,Foot miracle,I've used it for for about six months. Liked it so much I'm using it for gifts as stocking Stuffers
5,Millsy Rox My Sox,"Millsy is a legend, this album is not a lame as u may think = miss vanity is the exception but dont let that put u off! Mighty fine effort so get urself a copy got it!!! lol Rok on Millsy !!! (="
2,Horrible Quality for such a BIG price!,"This producte failed to rise up to the challenge when I needed it the most! I was told this was the product to get, the only problem is most people don't use these type of products often enough to ""REALLY"" put them to the appropriate test! I was up at the 7,500' altitude level in the Sierra's and needed to make a fire with this and failed!The first day it worked like a charm with the dry tinder. The second day, I couldn't get this this to light a fire if my life depended on it (and my life nearly did depend on it). I tried probably around 50 strikes, when I believe the heat from the rod finally just melted the base of the strike device off the blast match and made the tool worthless! I'm extremely disappointed with the performance of the product. I thought I was being the smart guy at camp, meanwhile all the other campers had their fire in less than 5 minutes with their tried and tested Firesteel product! Shame on Blast Match for making such a subpar product!"
3,For those who dont appreciate the usefulness of a business lunch,"Dont know whether I had too high an expectation of it under the influence of its title ""the ART of the ...."" or the very favorable comment on the back cover and here on Amazon I had been a little bit disappointed. Perhaps I have been in the business for long so I truly believe that the ideas covered by the author should be readily practised by even the mildly successful sales or account executives. If you are a greenhand in the industry or you honestly consider yourself ignorant of business etiquette and networking, the book is still fine for you. However, if you want to read something of the advanced level, ""Never Eat Alone: And Other Secrets to Success, One Relationship at a Time"" by Keith Ferrazzi and Tahl Raz would be a much better but demanding choice."
1,Big disappointment from one who's been to cancerland too.,"I too have breast cancer that has metastasized so I know of what I speak. The author could have used her talents to encourage and teach others about this dreaded disease. The writing was choppy at best. On one page she prays to God then on another she uses His name in vain then a few pages over she has sex with a guy out of wedlock, she is no role model for us cancer patients. She uses so much profanity I thought she was a sailor instead of an educated person. Usually when I finish a book I give it to others, not this one, it goes into the trash."
5,Quite beautiful,"These stockings are gorgeous. They are soft and are well made. In the picture they look white, but the color is actually a pale pink. We love them."
2,Not of much use to me,"I'm sure this book proved helpful to some, but ultimately I never used it - my teacher decided not to."
5,This book is a classic.,My only mistake was in reading it 45 years agothat i thought this dystopian world was inevitableand ran from that prospect for years rather than engagingin the wonders of life in a free society.
2,It just will NOT fit my 30GB properly,"OK, so I can't figure it out - some people report that their 30GB Video iPods fit perfectly in this skin, and some say it's a bad fit...I, for one, think this is a terrible fit for my 30GB! I've put in the insert it came with, tried pulling and pushing and everything I can think of to make it fit -- but the case just WILL NOT lay flat around the screen protector! It ""peels away"" on the top and sides of the screen, leaving a big gap for dirt to get in. Not to mention that it looks awful fitting that poorly.It also doesn't lay flat against the clickwheel...so not only is the clickwheel not protected, but there's a big gap there for dirt to get in as well.It fit my friend's 60GB ipod very well, however.I think this case was designed for the 60/80GB iPods, and the 30GBs were just an afterthought...that rubber insert is just not cutting it.Even for the thirteen bucks I paid for this on an Amazon sale, it's just not worth it. Bummer."
4,Skin,"Great product works really well, only issue is that you have to tak ethe IPOD out to go onto a craddle. Liked the belt loop and the backing piece to reduce wear."
5,Does exactly what I need it to do,"Great product, I also have one for my Ipod nano. If you use your Ipod in a dock, this is not the case for you because your Ipod will not fit in the dock unless you remove the case which isn't that hard to do but it would be a pain if you docked your Ipod frequently . I only use my Ipod in my cars so I don't have to remove the case. For durability and protecting you Ipod from damage of shock from being dropped, the Speck ToughSkin can't be beat!"
3,I guess it works,"I just got this case - and I must say, I'm sure it works... but it makes your iPod HUGE, but my biggest complaint is that it makes your ipod look like a TIRE.I've seen the tire case for the nano, and it doesn't look as bad, but for the video... crazy.For people who like to stay in fashion I suggest getting a clear case, because this one is just too ugly."
1,"Shoddy research, bad writing","I can only echo what others have written about this shoddy excuse for a study of one of American's most fascinating phenomena--the yearly race for the Oscar. Levy should be ashamed of the plethora of factual errors--and that the errors are inconsistent in content from one page to another (as another critic has pointed out) points the blame not only at him but at the [bad] job that passes for copy and proof editing at Continuum. In addition, his style is awkard and uninteresting--appropriate neither to an academic audience nor to a general reader. And his analyses are obvious and lacking in anything truly insightful. ""Inside Oscar,"" though out of date, remains a much livelier and more thoughtful study of the Oscars--we can only hope a revision of it is in the works. In the meantime, skip this..., irritating book."
1,not as good as another brand,"I was quite disappointed when I received this. First, it looked like someone printed a label from their desktop and stuck it on a small dark brown bottle. It was very sour and not at all like another brand of verjus that I had previously purchased. I'm not sure this one was even from France. I threw it out after I tasted it, so I can't remember exactly what it said on the bottle.The one I previously purchased - http://www.amazon.com/Domaine-du-Siorac-Perigord-Verjus/dp/B0008JEZ4K/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1341338906&sr;=8-3&keywords;=Verjus - is true verjus from France. It is very smooth tasting and worked very well in salad dressings and gastriques.I won't be buying verjus from this merchant in the future."
3,We celebrate the day a King was born.,"This Christmas album by Merle Haggard was originally released in 1973. The first half features new songs written by Merle, the second half features traditional Christmas songs. The album's highlight is Hag's classic #1 Country hit ""If We Make It Through December"". The rest of his original songs aren't all that memorable. The older songs are decently done, but not done in a way to set them apart from the countless other versions of ""White Christmas"" and ""Jingle Bells"". But the CD is arguably worth getting just to have ""If We Make It Through December""."
2,mediocrity from a good musician,"Having heard Wolf in NYC play these songs, I thought I would like the album but the recording focuses too much on the vocals (not his biggest asset) and too little on the jazz-fusion of the live performance. Use your money to go see him live, forget the CD."
1,There are a lot better sources out there.,"The book is inaccurate, showing examples that do not work. Sample files from the book (downloadable) are neither documented well, nor functional. Treatment of Perl is based on a few scenarios that the author found useful, most likely they will not pertain to you. The author neither gives you the constructs, nor the framework for you to build on his knowledge and create solutions of your own. After purchasing and reading the book, I had to resolve my Perl needs by searching for code on the web and changing it to suit me. You can do much better with the free information available via your browser."
5,They are guitar picks.,"They are guitar picks. They do what I need them to do. They help me when I play the guitar. They work well. I wish they were another color besides orange, blue or plaid would be cool."
2,why not a book of stories,"I kept wondering why verse for these little stories? with Louise gluck, for example, you are haunted by what's left out. here, there's just not enough room to fill in the gaps. certainly not a boring book, but upon completion oddly unsatisfying. many of the poems reminded me of early billy joel songs, although there's much more here that shocks. after reading this book i happened to read last exit to brooklyn for the first time and it wiped out any memory i had of the characters/situations in jimmy and rita."
2,Mixed fealings,"The quality of the recording varies from song to song. The Water Dance, shimmering freeze, spice, and silk are of poor quality, while other songs are more tolerable to decent. The music itself is pretty good. Some of these songs could be of use in class or around the house. Probably not a good choice for professional dancing. Would be great if the sound quality were better."
1,Innovative Design w/ a unforeseen defect,"Very innovative! However, these glasses require you have a slim shaped head like a Slim Jim. I have an oval head and my pair started to get hairline cracks after a month of wear. The later snapped at the arm, I got them repaired np. After 2 months the cracks returned and they snapped again. I am trying to get the replaced w/ a different model and break this vicious cycle."
4,more than I expected,"This glucose meter and strips seems to work faster and more accurately than others I have used. The 100 test strips come in boxes of 50, only one of which had an expiration date of more than 1 year. The other was only 7 months. The short dated box came complete with a live roach. Not exactly what I expected. I don't like insecticide either so of the two I guess I had rather deal with one insect. Shipping was not very quick and my order should have been sent in a box instead of a lightly padded envelope. Maybe I'm just being picky."
4,great product works perfect every time,Great seller. Product is good as advertised. I would order from this selleragain in the future.
2,"Odd, cinnamon taste","Although this didn't taste awful, it really wasn't much differentthan cinnamon. Not the rich Ethiopian flavor I hoped.Zamori's was much more like it."
4,"Boyfriend loves it! A little tweaking needed, but great","This is a beautiful humidor, very spacious, great wood. It takes a while to kick up, and you really have to play around to get it right. You also have to buy the proper products (water, etc) to get it started and maintained. But it's really impressive and gets ""ohhs"" and ""ahhs"" from everyone. Highly recommended, for a GREAT price."
4,Mother's Intention,In good shape. Few markings! I've read several pages and the information is outstanding in empowering women to really consider how they prepare for their births as it changes who we are. Grateful to have this on my library shelves and I look forward to reading it! Thank you!
2,Not worth it,"There is really not much to this book. It's not very innovative or inspiring. The advice is fairly bland. Pretty much about the same type of information that you might find in a magazine, which is not surprising when you learn that the author wrote for Cosmo.It's fine but not that interesting if you are even remotely adventurous although, as a woman I found that it had some good instruction on going down on women, the male instructional was not revelatory. Perhaps more for those who have been together for a long time and are looking for some tips that aren't too randy or out of the comfort zone. I won't be keeping this one or making it the subject of any recommendations."
5,A gift for my sister&brother-in-law.,"They are raving about it still,and playing it more than a month after the Christmas holiday season. Sister-in-law claims it every bit as good as her most cherished Elvis Pressley Cd."
2,"Good music, bad mix/sound quality.","This is one of the worst sounding Kenny Rogers albums Ive ever heard. Good selection of songs, but the sound quality is near MP3 quality, at best. Somehow, boomy and tinny at the same time. It IS more acceptable in my vehicle than on my audiophile stereo system, though. For the price, not a waist of money."
2,DIDN'T LAST LONG!,"I bought this cd player for my three year old son. We both just loved it and it worked wonderfully well. It did go through batteries very fast though and then it just quit working after about five weeks! I had lost the receipt so there was nothing I could do about it. I tried to find another one but they were no where to be found so I contacted Emerson, the manufacturer, and they quit making them two years ago. If I had the receipt, they would give me a refund for the one I bought. But there is no way I could get another one. You can still find them on the internet now and then but I would not count on it being a very reliable product. Be sure to keep your receipt!"
2,Dark Fantasy for the Developmentally Arrested.,"For those out there who have ever fantasized about what it would be like to have, uh, relations with either Tinkerbell or The Amazing Fifty Foot Woman, then look no farther than this book. The delightful answers are to be found here, in all their spicy detail. While it is obvious that Robert Devereaux is a fine writer, I found his creative vision so one track it was almost monorail. By the time the three undead Brides of Dracula appear and are named Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail I was growling at the book. If fantasy characters involved in graphic, kinky sex before getting down to the nitty, gritty ultra-grue (when appropriate, that is) is your thing, then this semi-anthology (it's really five short stories and a novel) is for your. Frankly I found the blend less than intoxicating and more than infuriating."
1,hmm,"so I ordered this as it had the cheapest price including the shipping on amazon, but when I got it, it did not light up when i plugged it in and didn't work at all... nothing I plugged into it showed up on my computer. I dont know if this is common, but it happened to me... looking into the exchange policy, although it might not be worth it since i'm pretty sure I have to pay shipping to return it. Might as well get another one."
5,Perfect!,"I bought this kit to repair 1/4"" FINE threads on an old sports car. It worked perfectly. Will use Helicoils to make some other repairs too. Saved me a lot of disassembly."
3,Price isn't everything,"I wear the new balance 623's and order them from the internet all the time. I saw these and ordered,not realizing that there wasn't free returns. They came and they were very tight. I had to return them and pay $12 for the return. I will say they came promptly and they looked fine. I will choke it up to my mistake ordering them without trying on this model but never had this problem before. Thanks anyway."
1,Not as wide as previous 609's,I've been buying New Balance 9.5 4E (wide) for about six years now and have gone through 6 to 8 pairs. I'm not sure what changed but these feel like 9.5 Narrow to me. They are killing my feet. I wouldn't recommend purchasing based on previous experiences.
5,Loved this Book!,This book is great. I really enjoyed reading it. I did not want to put it down. I tracked down the other two books in the series. They are all wonderful. At the end of the book I wished it wasnt over. I love Allie and Jack. I highly recommend this book and the other two in the series.
1,Stick with PhotoShop or Paint Shop Pro editing tools,"This product is advertised as a ""powerful masking"" tool that lets you ""isolate and separate a detailed foreground object from an image."" It is, however, an expensive tool that does not work as well as the tools built into Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro. The selection tools within Paint shop, including the magic wand, are far more discriminating than Knockout and require far less touch ups. I can isolate and separate objects from graphics with Paint Shop Pro in 1/10th of the time as Knockout allows and with 10 times the accuracy.We all want a simpler way to isolate objects from graphics but this just isn't it. Save your money and spend it on other photo editing software plug-ins."
4,George Jones Greatest Country Hits - Curb Records,"A must have for any Jones fan. I try to get good collections for most of my favorite artists; this CD is a treasure due to its high quality recordings of George's earlier hits. There is a marked difference between these original releases and later more polished versions. This CD better represents the ""World's Best Honky Tonk Singer"" much better than the releases made after he made the ""Big Time"" and the success that he handled so poorly that it almost killed him. Would have been 5 stars if it had a few more songs on it.Combine this CD with George Jones - 24 Greatest Hits (TeeVee Records - The Musicor years 1965 to 1971) and you will have just about all the George Jones required to show what a great singer he really was.I have most of his later releases through the 90's but these songs are the ones that define George Jones and get listened to most often."
3,Classroom in-a-book,"This book is definetly geared toward a classroom environment, consisting mostly of worksheets/quizzes on basic design elements. The excercises are also very basic, involving tracing dot-to-dots, filling in missing areas of a design, etc. While this would be great for elementary school/middle school kids, it isn't as useful for independent learners, though there are good tidbits of information here and there. Also note that this book (and the other two books in the series) do not deal with meaning at all - they are purely concerned with the technical aspect of the art.In terms of the technical aspects of learning Pacific Northwest Coast art I highly recommend Clark & Gilbert's ""Learning by Designing, vol. 1"" and Bill Holm's ""Northwest Coast Indian Art: An Analysis of Form""."
3,Educational,"I played this game when I was younger. I heard someone talking about and wanted to play again for old times sake. It is very educational, but a little slow. A game takes forever to play and it doesn't really change a whole lot from game to game so it is very easy to master."
2,Need to take a college class to use this game.,"I installed this game, and read the directions on how to use it. The directions are like reading an entire book, and a person would almost have to take a class to figure this out. There are a lot of complicated parts to playing this, including market analysis etc. If you want to really get into the nitty gritty details, this might be for you. But if you are used to playing ""Farmville"" type games, this one is very very complicated, to the point that it may not be fun for you, but more like work."
5,Incredible price for incredible animation,"I was really surprised on the price drop. this was over two hundred dollars a couple of years ago.For the money I was extremely impress on how my animations looked when I convert files and made DVDs.Needless to say, the learning curve on this is steep and after a year, I don't really get some of the things that's offered in this software.rendering is slow and there's nothing you can do about it.I have a P4 1.7ghz and one of my work took over 30days to render.The results are great!"
4,camera wallet,It's a great little cmaera case with enough space to put a drivers license and paper money. The leather is smooth and soft and and the inside is lined to protect the camera
1,"Talented beauty boy, questionable morals","While Arce lays out the details of Power's life in short, concise order, his allegations of the star's indiscretions leave much to be desired in the way of proof. Lots of subjectivity and conjecture with little to back it up. Leaves you shaking your head about where he got all of this stuff.Read it for the bio--which I did find interesting--but the rest of it is anybody's best guess."
2,Bit of a Mess,"Book is a bit of a mess, rambles and cites newspaper articles as sources. There is a huge gap at the end, so if one wants to know the where, when and how of his death, reader will have to research that all on her own. The only thing I came away with out of this book, was that Mr. Power was a very lonely individual. Still not convinced he was gay - no proof provided."
5,"Walter Beaseley's ""Ready for Love"" is.....Great Sax!!","I've followed Walter's music for years and greatly enjoyed Ready for Love! In my book, Walter rates in the top 5 artists that are still currently recording. My top artist is still Boney James because of his mellow tones and creative interpretations of not only his new music, but also from other artists, but Walter Beasley's music is a close second and I can reccommend this one highly!"
5,LOVELY,"This is a great album from a great musical family. Truly a treat. Also, F. Howelll was inquiring about a song called ""Your Incredible"" that song is done by Eloise Laws, Debra's sister. They have a remake of the album on the market but no where as good as the first album ""Eloise"".Enjoy Debra!"
2,Reconciliation by Martin Smith,"Fr. Smith has an outstanding grasp of the theology behind the sacrament of reconciliation. However, his practical applications show his liberal agenda and bias. He suggests that single people in sexual relationships have no need to seek reconciliation if their relationship is committed. He suggest that same for homosexuals. He also demonstrates a very Low Church view of the concept of Real Presence in the Eucharist.I would recommend people wanting to gain an understanding of reconciliation to stay away from the chapters dealing with preparing for your first confession.Fr. Thomas Vece, OFSJ"
5,Excellent Book,"Siri mitchell has written another excellent book that has appeal to a broad range of interests-cooking, medieval legends and folklore, romance, running a business, healing from wounds of the past; Siri covers it all. I hope she writes many more like it!"
3,"Liked it, more of a love story","love story with some fictional history in it. A woman discovers historical past of her chateau, and runs an Inn and is great cook and is healing from her husband's death and discovering herself story. If it wasn't for the little history i would have given up. I have loved her other books."
5,Excellent Book!,"Siri Mitchell did it again for me! I previously read ""Kissing Adrien"" and thought I would try this book as well. I was not dissappointed. The writing is great, the characters come to life on the pages. Her details of cooking and France continue to make me want to go there! It is a great story, that kept me up at nights. I did not want to put this book down!"
3,"Clicks in the car cassette, but works and has integrity.","Clicks while working in my 2001 stock Toyota Avalon Cassette player. Works well functionally, however, and has shown integrity--hasn't broken. If you listen to your music loud enough, you won't notice. Can easily confuse with leaving on your car blinker light noise."
1,"Should be ""zero"" star review","This adapter broke the tape player on my car, so that it will now not play regular tapes. On the second use, it became stuck in the player, and could not be removed by use of the eject button or by use of the eject button with gentle pulling on the unit. Removal required more-than-gentle pulling while pushing the eject button, and now the tape player unit does not work with tapes OR the adapter. This is an inexpensive unit that turns out to be very costly. Perhaps I should sue Amazon and the maker for the cost of replacing my car's tape/radio/CD player."
5,Unbelievable,"I've never seen a book that covers half of what this book covers on storyboards. I had no idea there was this much to doing storyboards. The new 3rd edition is also beautiful with tons of great sample art.Plus, the information is well written and easy to understand. I've been struggling to find an easy way to color my digital boards and this book quickly showed me how.You won't believe how big this book is. I can't believe it costs less than the last edition, and this one is in full color. I've always been interested in storyboarding, and now I feel it's something I can tackle.This is my new bible on storyboarding."
2,This may not be the book you think it to be,"The details of the development of the first Mars rover was interesting and reasonably well done. I was somewhat distracted by the elaboration of JPL politics and personality conflicts. From this author's point of view, JPL sure sounds like an unpleasant place to work. I felt that the personality conflict part of the book was overemphasized and distracted from what a typical reader wants from a book about the Sojourner rover."
2,"Important material, dry presentation","I find the material covered in this book to be very important. Unfortunately, the presentation is extremely boring, dry, and repetitive. I'm giving it two stars only because there seems to be a general lack of good books on proper software design using java. Otherwise, I'd have given it a single star."
2,NO Support at Corel for fluid,Fluid has problems forwarding and backwarding on the show movie and making movie section section. Can't froward or backward in the movie nor in fluid filter.Found others on the internet that had the same problems.When I went to Corel's web page they had no FAQ's for KPT nor KPT fluid. And no help section for them either.
2,Really strange,"Bizarre and strange storyline. I'm not sure it made any sense. I don't understand the film, it was complicated and difficult to understand."
5,A stunning work of animation,"I watched Paprika after watching the trailer on the net. I wasn't disappointed. This is a stunning work of Japanese anime; I was mesmerized by the visuals but a bit lost in the plot until the ending explained everything.Director Satoshi Kon is in top form here when he devises a world entirely outside of our own, but with complete internal logic. In his world, there exists a means of intervening in another's dreams, with the ostensible purpose of aiding the dreamer resolve his conflicts and emotions in his life.The world view and stunning visuals are really not to be missed. And don't worry about trying to understand the plot as you are going along. It's not that hard to follow (unlike, say, 2046) and it's all wrapped up in the end.Worth buying and watching again for the sheer pleasure of the visuals.Recommended"
4,Another great Satoshi Kon,"Any Anime fan worth their salt will be familiar with Satoshi Kon's work. For those who are not, you are in for a treat. Paprika is definitely heads and shoulders above a great deal of anime films, and deserves a spot in the top 30. Having said that, it is not my favorite of Satoshi Kon's work. Millennium Actress and Perfect Blue are the best of his work in my opinion, with Paprika taking 3rd or 4th place.The production values, and art are top notch, the story adequate, and quality of the blu ray transfer is of almost reference quality. The blacks are deep and inky and the colors are phenomenal. It comes with a dubbed and subbed audio selection and a bit more extras that you'd normally see on a blu ray anime. For under $20 this disc is a steal."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"We bought these because they were cheap and since we are running a make shift animal rescue and were moving, we needed something that was cheap and we could get in bulk.Let me tell you, you get what you pay for. Within two minutes of wrangling up all the kitties, they had busted out of these carriers using only their claws. They literally tore them up, to pieces. We have one cat that is declawed and even she escaped. We ended up having to use duct tape to seal the holes the cats had ripped in them and even then, while we were driving to our new home, three cats escaped and were wandering around our Explorer while I was trying to drive.The moving day was stressful enough on its own, add to it the ease of which our cats escaped from this very cheap, very poorly made product, and you can imagine the day we had.If I could do it over again, I would spend the extra money for sturdier, reusable carriers. Take it from me, it's worth the money."
1,Digital Copy Warning,"Loved the movie, saw it in IMAX when it came out. Giving it one star due to deceptive and inaccurate listing by the studio and Amazon.Amazon and the studio failed to disclose this is an UltraViolet digital copy. You cannot load this into iTunes and can view it only by streaming. This means if you want to watch while you are not on wi-fi, you will be chewing through your data plan.To access the digital copy, you will are required to open a Flixster AND UltraViolet accounts, link them together and allow they access to all activity and information when accessing either account.I am returning this movie and purchasing my digital copy from iTunes directly."
2,A make out movie... Not missing much,"Slow to start, low energy through out, weak finish. See MI3 for everything this movie wasn't. Spend some quality time with your lady and use this flick as an excuse to snuggle. ;-)"
4,Suspense,"Enjoyed the movie and the convenience of using the Amazon program. Was uncertain of how all would work out; I was pleasantly surprised of how easily it was accomplished.Good movie, good process."
5,Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol,"Very entertaining movie. Awesome special effects, plot is boring but all around it was a pretty good movie. It is worth picking up for you collection."
5,I love this movie!!,"It's good quality with clear sound. I saw it more than once and old, but still like it. Thank you."
1,One Star,"Tom felt the series needed some comic relief, so the ""funny out of his element"" computer hacker/expert continually makes jokes that bring the action to a screeching halt. This comic relief character, when the tension is at it's height, has to say something ""funny"", not witty, that destroys the momentum of the moment. The Mission Impossible series has always been a roller coaster ride with a thrill a minute. This version is a Disney Tea Cup ride, with a thrill every 30 to 45 minutes.Terrible script, terrible acting, and terrible directing."
2,NO IMAX Switching???????,"The movie was awesome, however I have one real big head-scratcher for the Director... Dude, you invested all this time and care into producing some fantastic sequences utilizing the IMAX format, but you chose to leave the cropped theatrical aspect ratio throughout the entire film and depriving the viewers who bought the HD Blu-Ray format of the extra glorious expanded IMAX shots. What the hell were you thinking there? I'd call this a technical problem that should be fixed and replaced free to Blu-Ray owners. Major downgrade in my rating for that to an otherwise cool film.Christopher Nolan at least the right idea for The Dark Knight Blu-Ray release. What's the point of using the technology if you're not going to show it in all its glory?"
2,Annoying movie,This movie is an assault on your senses. It's loud. It gives you no rest. It's just one impossible action stunt after another. I had to turn it off.
4,Great show,I bought this movie for a gift. It came quickly and the recipient was excited to have this as one of his gifts.
4,Unexpectedly funny,"I expected this to be the typical ""sequels get worse"" movie, but I like this one almost as much as the first. Their was no perfection in it. They screwed up and it was funny, in a serious setting. I liked that."
3,Mission improbable,"Ya know...Im a fan of the other Mission Impossibles but this one was just kinda...stale...Yea, I think that is an adequate description...stale. After watching it I felt like I should have thrown on a ""Die Hard"" instead."
3,IMAX scenes cropped!,"I would wait for the other version that includes the full IMAX scenes, not the cropped version. don't know why Brad Bird decided to go this route...but I am very disappointed.the Amazon stated aspect ration of 1.85:1 is just plain wrong, it should be 2.40:1"
4,ENJOYABLE ACTION,I went to see this movie after all the usual hype and thoroughly enjoyed it.Although the start is corny it turns out to be a great tongue in cheek action movie with some clever puns and digs throughout and great stunts.If you love BMW's this will prove to be a tear jerker for you.
3,It is another MI with Tom Cruise.,"I like Tom Cruise and will watch most movies he is in; however, I may have reached my saturation point of him in MI movies. It was just another MI story with Tom and was OK."
3,He Should Have Quit While He Was Ahead,"I am really not a very demanding viewer when it comes to movies, give me a shallow plot and half a dozen good explosions and I'm good to go. Perhaps if I had not seen the first three Mission Impossible flicks I would have really enjoyed this one, but compared to its predecessors Ghost Protocol is at best an okay movie. Don't get me wrong, I've watched the DVD several times, it's fun, I like it. But it will never be anything more than ""okay"". Cruise should have stopped while he was ahead.Still, who knows maybe Mission Impossible 5 will come up with a really dynamite plot, and if not there will always be MI 6 or 7 or . . ."
2,Really?,"Other than the action sequences which were good, the movie has a very thin plot and generally was not worth my time. I would not recommend."
3,Perhaps 1 too many MI??,"All the elements of a Mission Impossible (MI) are there but for some reason, this one seemed to lack a certain snap for me. Felt scripted to me. I know, all films are scripted but this one had that, lull between ""events"", special effects, feel to it. Oh, this one is Ok but nothing special and I still like the first MI film the best. When only an action film will do and nothing better to watch."
1,"5 Stars for the movie, 1 star for the product","Seriously bummed out that they won't be opening up the matte for the IMAX scenes, feels like Paramount really cheaped out with this disc. I understand that it's more expensive to go through the work of creating discs like Tron:Legacy, Dark Knight, and Transformers 2 for BD release with IMAX incorporated, but with how hyped up some of the IMAX scenes in MIGP were I thought it would be a given. I heard from his twitter comments that Brad Bird doesn't like to see a shift in aspect ratio for home video, but somebody at Paramount should have had veto power on this decision. For me this is a dealbreaker, and I'm sure that I'm not the only one who won't be purchasing the disc because of this. For now I'll have to Redbox it when I want to watch, and hopefully we will eventually see a better release."
2,Yikes!,"This movie accomplished one impossible mission, which was to ruin the franchise. It came across as if someone's vision of the movie was conflicted from the very start, because the movie itself was all over the place. Tom Cruise gave a lackluster performance as super spy Ethan Hunt, but his entire crew for this movie seemed inept. With the exception of Jeremy Renner as William Brandt who's performance was outstanding, the rest of the team appeared to be miscast in their roles. Michael Nyqvist, of the original Dragon Tatoo movies was also gave a very good performance as Kurt Hendricks.The story itself presented as a comedy of errors more than anything. Not even close to what I expected from the Mission Impossible movies. While diehard Cruise fans will probably enjoy it, I wouldn't recommend it."
4,action-packed and full of excitement,As entertaining as any of the other IMF films. The on-location shots were great. Those with vertigo had better be prepared.
4,great--even for a guy who hated the second tom cruise MI,"a good MI movie with gadgets, suspense and all one expects from this franchise. i liked it just fine dude (had to add extra words to get review accepted)."
5,Hoping for MI 5,"I wasn't expecting too much out of Ghost Protocol, I figured what else could they really do that hadn't been done. I was wrong I really enjoyed this one and I am now hoping they will make MI5."
2,Ridiculous,Nothing like the original series. Lame comes to mind. Some good ideas for special effects poorly employed. Should have been a made for tv movie.
1,Worst Movie EVER,"Step away from the buy/rent button trust me you will regret renting/purchasing this movie...Oaky, First off I 'm a fan of action movies and had high hopes for this particular installment of MI. Wow was I wrong. It's bad as in never want to see it again... want my money back... wasted my life... screaming profanities at the TV kinda bad. The best part of the movie was the end and I don't mean the ending. I mean the end as in when the screen went black. Seriously a total disappointment.Additionally I tried to give this zero stars but Amazon wouldn't let me nor did they have a negative stars option but if they did I'd be so there."
1,not what I expected...,"I wouldn't advertise it ever as a good time film. There are nice movies right now. Take Limitless, Island, Hangover, and so on. It is an old movie, quality are not as good either. Technology can't go back but it can create greatness!"
4,Southern View,This movie was as entertaining as other Tom Cruse projects. I enjoyed it even if it seems predictable; but isn't that what we sometimes want?
3,Decent Product. But SCRATCHED DVD once again.,"The movie is ok. However, the reason to write this review, is the problem i've had lately with DVD products from amazon.Yet another time, i've got a brand new DVD, scratched, unplayable. Just because the blu ray was covered with some ads, i went and put the DVD disc. About 30 minutes in, the movie starts skipping and it was impossible to continue.I went to check, and the DVD is heavily scratched. I check out the case, and i saw the Bluray disc. It worked just fine.Lately, almost 30% of the DVDs i get from amazon, are scratched. This is really weird, because the packaging seems like new, so i cannot understand how this happened.BTW: This is the only disc i checked after problems. The other discs i complain about, are checked before putting in the player.(Yes, i checked, its not the player scratching discs)."
2,An unsurprising disappointment,"Usually I don't bother watching Mission Impossible movies, since they're all terrible. However, this one got good reviews at a site I trust, so I gave it a go.Bad idea. The effects and the action and the gadgets are all great; it's when the actors stop shooting and start talking that you realize that every non-action bit of the movie is sub-par window dressing. The only bright spot in this movie is Simon Pegg, but he doesn't do enough to warrant spending any money at all to see it.One word: Netflix. And only if you're really, really bored."
1,"Bad Plot, Awful Acting",I don't understand how anyone could have rated this trash with 5 stars.The plot is foolish and Cruise is a disaster. Beyond awful! Could he ever act?This is another example of Hollywood making a movie exclusively for money without any idea of entertainment!Don't waste your money
3,Decent action movie.,"I mean I liked it, but I think that is enough with mission impossible. I liked Tom Cruise in it he is pretty good in all his movies. For a typical action movie it was good. I would say you will still like the movie because the action was good and the story line was good. I would watch it again."
5,Very Entertaining.,"This movie is incredibly entertaining, good balance of action and humor. I wasn't expecting this movie to be that good and after watching it, I was glad I had to the chance to experience it on the IMAX Screen. If you liked the previous Mission impossible movies, you'll enjoy this one."
2,Fell Asleep,"It certainly has some tricky ideas, but Tom should have retired years ago. In fact, thinking back, his breakdown on Oprah's show was far more entertaining than this worn-out franchise. Had it been any other actor (except Matt) this would never have made it to Mission: Impossible 2 let alone 5!!!!! This and the BOURNE franchise are so over-hyped that Chuck Dee got a rash when he watched it. Don't- Don't believe the Hype!"
3,Mission imposible,Pretty good action. Lots of high tech effects. Fairly fun to watch if you have some time on your hands.
4,High rise escapism,"Though I am not an afficionado of this franchise, I am partial to good high rise stunts (Vertical Limits!), hence my family had an easy job dragging me into a cinema for this.While I dislike Cruise as a person in theory, I can't help being intrigued in practice by the huge ego of this little man. Allegedly he does his stunts himself. Chapeau!In this all in all not unusually dumb action story (Evan Hunt, aka Cruise, saves the world again), Cruise gets to climb up the outside of Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Imagine 130th floor and the wind that comes with the elevation. Magnifico.Also good: the sand storm comes to Dubai and we have a nice car race in it.Forget about all the rest.(Talking about little Cruise: I just reviewed a volume from the popular Jack Reacher series and found it very trashy. Then I learned in google that Cruise is supposed to play Reacher in a film. Another case of his huge ego: Reacher is supposed to be a huge man, 6 feet 5 or so.)"
3,Typical MI movie,"Not that any MI movie has been great. All action, no story makes a long movie. Time for Tom Cruise to hang it up."
2,CRUISE JUMPED THE SHARK,Mission Impossible 1 had both plot and decent action. This movie continues the downward spiral of this series. Tom Cruise may have jumped the shark with this movie. I got tired of watching endless scenes of Cruise running through various streets and alleys. Recommend buying Knight & Day on blu-ray instead...or buy season 3 of Justified when its available.
1,No Special Features!,"I pre-ordered this from Amazon. I won't comment on the movie itself since that's a matter of taste. But I was very disappointed that there were no ""special features"" on either disc. I had the same issue when I pre-ordered the latest ""Transformers"" film. Why pay extra to own when there are no extras included? Both are Paramount films. In the future, I'll either rent or wait until they're on HBO or Showtime. I'll also be much more careful when I pre-order Blu-Rays from Amazon. I won't buy if there are no special features and I won't re-purchase the same movie if it's released later with the special features."
3,Not as good as earlier ones.,"It was even more convoluted and not that exciting, in my opinion. Watching it for free made it more acceptable."
5,Action Packed,It's always nice to see Tom Cruise in a movie. He does some daring acts that put me on the edge of my seat. We will surely watch this again.
4,"Good, not impressive","Nice movie.Has some great action scenes, but nothing really new.Great idea, worth watching. If you like the genre, you should watch it."
2,Seemed like a 1970's bond film,Seems like the movie was played more for laughs than the previous Mission Impossible films. Kind of a sappy ending with his wife still being alive.
3,Mission: Imposible Ghost Protocol,"It wasn't too bad. The pacing is good. It keeps you entertained. Cruise is Cruise, but the other actors are more fun too watch."
2,Fine for a little time,"This drive seemed ideal for my use, i.e. additional storage and backup. My system is windows 98ME with USB 1.1. Drive worked OK for about 6 months, started to make ""clanky"" sounds, died and took my computer with it. I expected better from Maxtor. I'm not sure what caused this since the drive was never physically moved and it had ample ventilation."
1,I just lost four years of research and memories,Works great until it crashes! It crashed with out any warning! I will not buy another maxtor drive.
3,Moon,"Book as described. They shipped within the time allowed, but rather slowly and near the end of the time."
5,Every parent should read this book!,"A quick and easy read (my wife and I read it together in one sitting) that outlines a painfully simple yet amazingly effective strategy for ending whining and tantrums. We had a two year old who was about to drive us both into therapy with constant tantrums, testing, and controlling behavior. Things got worse for about a week, but we stuck with it. He is now a totally different kid. Try it with your ""high spirited"" child."
1,Waste of money,this is the single most waste of money on this page. If it would be 100% free to return I would. You can do better in a book or internet. You have to turn on the computer and load the program every time you need a recipe. They don't have pictures. The recipes aren't necessarily rated they're just a collection of recipes that have been placed on a cd-rom. I had the same version with different title already at home and paid at least $2 less for it. Save your money.
3,got 2 for same side,"I ordered a pair of these, assuming that they'd send me one for the driver's side and one for the passenger's side. I received 2 passenger side. The mounting brackets are different, but mirror images. I would have liked to just return one and have a correct replacement sent, but the only option that Amazon offered was to return both for a refund. So now I have to uninstall the one that fits and put on my old one.So I'm not sure if they only make one style or if they person pulling the product wasn't paying attention, but either way, I'm not too happy with having to waste my time because somebody at Amazon doesn't know the specifics on their product. I'm debating to try to reorder another pair from Amazon to see if another correct pair would be sent because they did have the best price and warranty that I could find."
4,Gory,For a first novel this is excellent. I liked the writing and the characters but the plot felt a bit over the top. It's definitely not a book for the faint hearted. The solution dropped the grade for me. I was even tempted towards a 3 but given that I enjoyed the first three quarters of the book I decided this was unfair. Without giving any spoilers I cannot say why I disliked the denouement other than that the psychology seemed a bit dime store. Overall this is a good if not great thriller that passed a day at the pool.
2,Not as billed...,"I gave this author an extra star because I felt The Baltimore Sun did him a disservice by setting up unrealistic expectations via their endorsement on the cover '...reads like a cross between Thomas Harris and F. Scott Fitzgerald', of which it is neither. However, it feels as if this attempt by Mr. Kerley is to write the 'great all American novel' with a serial killer twist. A lofty goal, but one that only draws attention to his limitations. It is a first attempt and worthy of our respect for the effort, but in my opinion it is ok to skip this one and start the series at a later stage in the hope that the author defines what it is he wants to be.... which isn't even close to the Baltimore Sun's definition, unfortunately."
4,Enjoyable Police Thriller,"For a first novel that sails in heavily charted waters (James Ellroy's L.A. Confidential and Nelson DeMille's alternating first-and-third person viewpoints come to mind), The Hundredth Man is surprisingly fresh and effective. That's because it does all the little things so well: humorous dialogue, insomnia-inducing suspense, multifaceted characters, and a tightly structured plot that navigates twists and turns a-plenty without veering off the rails.The only part that didn't work for me is a critical physical resemblance that's necessary to understanding the killer's motive but unknowable to the reader until revealed. All in all, though, this was a great read, and I'm looking forward to Carson Ryder's (and his evil alter ego Jeremy's) next adventures."
4,This worked and I liked it. I would recommend it.,I liked it because it worked great. This small adaptor worked for my PC. The only drawback was the price. But overall i like it and i recommend it to all.
1,Fat's Domino,"Here's a review for you, how the hell do you expect people to select CD's without listing the tunes. I have spent 20 minutes trying to find replacements for my ole 33's of Fat's Domino, Linda Rondstadt, Peppy Lee, Harry Belafonte, Roy Orbinson, Johnny Cash, Aretha Franklen, Joan Jett, Peter Gabrial and others, but you neglect to include the entire lineup in the meager 5 tunes you graciously provide us. I want to buy some CD's people, why are you making this harder than shopping at a music store. Janice BoyettePS. If you have a rival company maybe you would provide me with the name, and I wouldn't have to waste my time on your substandard service."
5,The Clearing weaves a web of sensual romance .,Mr. McBride's The Clearing weaves a web of sensual romance. His writing is sensitive and clever. Very refreshing style. I'm waiting for the Horsethief Moon to appear! Jim McBride has an usual talent.
5,Nice!,I've been waiting for this to release in a collection like this. If you have not seen this please do! This series shines and the more you watch the more you get hooked. My girl is watching this and she is not a big Anima fan but really likes this one and we watch it together. With a price point like this with 26 episodes it's a steal.
3,Not what we had hoped for,"One late night the husband and I stumbled across an episode of Auto B Good on television. We thought it would be perfect for our little boy who loves cars and cartoons and we were a fan of the fact it was by Focus on the Family. Although, the first episode we watched on TV was adorable the ones on this DVD were not what we had expected. The animation was good but the story lines were rather dull. I do plan on purchasing another DVD in the future to see if they stories get better."
2,Small interior,"While the outer pockets are nice, the main space inside is very small. This bag would be okay for running to the grocery store but if you are going to be out of the house for longer than that it just isn't practical. Also pretty expensive considering that lack of space. I did like the messenger bag style, but not enough to keep it."
3,More than nine lives.,I enjoyed this series very much but found the charmed lives of Rogue squadron to be a bit much. I like my fiction believable. To many characters were killed off and then brought back by some twist of fate. On a positive note I play X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter occasionally and reading the series made me dive back into the online battlefield where I was quickly blown away (where was Horn when I needed him). One last note. DON'T GIVE UP AN EMPIRAL STAR DESTROYER WITHOUT A FIGHT!!!
3,Bre's,"Out of the five books where Isard is the bad guy, this one is the best. I think one of the best things about Stackpole's writing is the empathy he creates for and with the characters. The characters feel real emotion, and are not stereotyped. (Stereotyping, by the way, tends to be a problem with some Star Wars novels.) The book is exiciting and well-paced, though, unfortunately, I am not very keen on the whole space battle thing. I am more interested in other aspects of Star Wars. I must also say that the inclusion of Booster Terrik added some good humour to the situation, which I thought was good. In addition, we also have an appearance by Talon Karrde. Overall, a great read. Recommended to any fan of the X-Wing series."
5,AWESOME BOOK!!,"I thought the book was great! I liked how Micheal was able to go into the average rogue life. I also think he did a good job of staying with the story line and working the main characters in with it. Good book! You should read it! Have you read it? Stop reading this and go read it now! Now I said, Now!No stop reading this."
5,Best X-Wing Book Yet!!!,"This, without question, is THE greatest X-Wing book! The dogfights are a must, and Iceheart's Star Destroyer Attacks are riveting! Plus, this book unravels alot of cool stuff, like Corran Horn meeting Booster Terrik! It's to die for"
2,The Dog Loved It,"Lithium Springs is a low(est)-budget film about a guy and his dog looking for the Fountain of Youth. I purchased this movie for my mini Dachshund, Buddy Ray. He loves movies with Dachshunds in it and I have watched The Ugliest Dachshund about 50 times and needed a change. Buddy Ray gives this movie Two-Paws-UP but all the people in the room groaned the entire 93 minutes. At least I can play it for Buddy Ray when I need to get work done around the house."
4,Good Price for a Simple Tool,How can you go wrong with one of these? It is a simple tool that does the job for half the price of name-brand cleaning kits.
4,OK cleanng kit,"After reading the bad reviews I bought it anyway because it was cheap. I comes with everything needed but one must question the engineering tht went into it. There are 2 small adaptors in the kit, one for the 17 size and one for the 22 size. Why didn't they make the rods for one size and just have an adaptor for the other?? Anyway, everything threads and will work fine from what I can tell. My last kit went bad after 10 years so I plan on getting another 10 out of this one. This is a small rod kit so if you plan on reaming on it it isn't going to last."
3,poor factory packaging = lost parts,This is a pretty nice kit but the factory packaging is not adequate. The handle and 22 cal brush were missing. I'll improvise a handle and live without the 22 brush but I am not pleased to be inconvenienced like this.
4,Great for the price,"Looks to have everything needed to do the job that I ordered it for. Yes, I would order this product again."
2,Product is cheap,"I bought this as a stuffer for my son's birthday bag. The product is real cheap, I would not buy this again. Go to walmart and spend the extra money for a better quality product, espescially if you are cleaning a gun with it!"
3,Till I get to the end of Tom,"This is the first Gillian Roberts book I have read. I enjoyed Amanda's assignments for her Lit. class, but that was it. Mrs. Wiggins was a tiring character and so was Zachary, Amanda's student. I would have to agree with the catchy opening, but that's all. There were too many loose ends and I kept wondering where the plot would go next. Mrs. Wiggins as the skeleton in the closet was a given. Am surprised that the review ratings are so high. Try another one of hers first."
4,"Good mystery, but a little too long","I enjoyed this Amanda Pepper mystery, however, I thought the book could have been shorter. It was quite long and didn't keep my interest all the way through. I never look at the end of a book, but kept thinking I might because it was so wordy. The end was a bit of a surprise, but guessed one of the characters identities before the end. I think this is a good series and I will definitely read more. Hopefully, not as long.Donna Davis"
2,Disappointed...,I found the cover deceiving. I thought the book would be filled with fun designs and better instruction for the home baker attempting to improve their presentation skills. I was also not happy with the icing recipes I tried. I do not recommend this book.
4,Grat tablet but...,"This tablet is solid and the pen feels good. Only complaint is the surface... they should have kept the surface of the Graphire2, which is soft and doesn't scratch... with this one, after a while you'll start feeling irregularities in the surface."
2,Deficient upper grill,"The bottom half of the grill seems to have adequate heat to achieve grill marks for most things grilled. However, the top grill has insufficient heat and no grill marks ever happen which defeats the purpose of having this kind of grill. I would not buy this grill again and maybe not buy another George Foreman product again."
3,OK for my purposes,"My old Foreman Grill broke, and I decided to get a smaller one to replace it. I recently moved into a smaller place and space is at a premium. Also, I am only cooking for one, so a small grill suits my needs.This grill has no timer, nor does it have a temperature setting. (My old one had both.) I was disappointed, but after a few days I just got used to checking my watch. I also bought a kitchen timer. I'm mostly cooking steaks and chicken breasts, so the time is pretty consistent.I also had a little trouble at first putting the plates back on. I have to double-check each time because they don't always snap on snugly. However, I've finally got it down to a science, so I've been using the grill every day with satisfactory results.If you're cooking for a family, this one is probably too small. But for one person in a smaller kitchen, it's not bad."
2,Disappointing:,"The concept of this product is great, but, the performance isn't. The top plate does not heat equal to the bottom and neither heat as well as the older models. Unless you are wanting one just for cleaning ease, I wouldn't recommend the one."
4,Grillin like a Villian,"We have had this for over a year now and I have no complaints. It still looks brand new, cooks great and cleans up well. The removable plates are great because you just pop them off, clean off any leftovers and throw them in the dishwasher."
2,Works ok,"I agree with other reviewers that this grill takes a long time to heat up. I had one just like it for years and didn't have that problem. This new grill takes longer to cook items too. Which I didn't realize when I cooked my fish and I found out the fish wasn't cooked all the way when I started to eat it. The fish was breaded and looked brown enough, but it wasn't cooked in the middle. I learned the second go around to cook longer. Which I didn't have to worry about with the previous grill. Oh well . . . I wouldn't purchase this particular grill again. Lesson learned to pay attention to reviews!!"
4,Decent buy,"The reason I have given 4 stars and not 5 is because I compared this unit to the older Jumbo model I owned. This is a jumbo model too, but comparitively, this has lesser surface area, is slower to heat up, is a little clumsy in design. The only reason I still prefer this new model over my previous older one is that this has detachable plates which are way too easy to clean than my previous one, which was quite a chore. We use the grill every day, whether its to cook frozen chicken strips/tater tots/frozen naans/grill veggies/fish etc etc."
5,great piece of cook ware,The George Foreman grill I purchased has been a god send. I have enjoyed using the grill and sure like the clean up.
3,"""New-Improved"" is not always BETTER !","George Foreman GRP4P Next Grilleration 4-Burger Grill with Removable Plates, PlatinumWe bought this grill to replace a 7year old 'basic' George Foreman Grill which was losing it's teflon coating.. the removable grillplates were the selling point - but they are also the 'achilles heel' of this design.. Heating time is almost double the old one, and the heat level is not uniform end-to-end, but I can't deny that they are easy to wash.. The product is well constructed and the 'touch parts' stay relatively cool - but I agree with others that think there should be an on/off switch in the body (NOT on the cord !!) IDR"
4,A Satisfied Customer,"I purchased the George Foreman GRP4 Next Grilleration 4-Burger Grill with Removable Plates, White solely for the removable plates. I have a larger George Foreman grill and although very satisfied with it, I HATED to clean it.The thing I miss on the GRP4 model is the timer button.The price was very reasonable."
2,I cooked my foot,"I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon- sue me- and since I don''t have a butler, I have to do it myself. So most nights before I go to bed I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill. I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious. It''s good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot. That''s it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that."
2,Not so Hot!!!!!!!!!!!!,"It works fine, but the thing takes too long to brown the outside of anything (burgers, fish, chicken, etc) and the while the inside overcooks."
1,Item not arrived,This item was suppose to arrive by the 22nd. It has not arrived and is barely being scanned in LA. This was a Christmas present.
2,Torcher,Every meal I have tried ends up scorched on top and fine on the bottom. If you have any suggestions please share them.
5,FABULOUS,This is a wonderful kitchen accessory. It is very easy to clean up. Just pop off the trays and they wash right off. I don't own a dishwasher but this is totally a non stick item. Hamburgers taste great and we even put some FROZEN New York steaks (it will hold two) and put on grill mate dry ingredients and cooked them and they were done perfectly and tasted better than on the grill. Kept the juices better than on the grill.
4,The George Foreman Next Grilleration grill is awesome,"I love this grill. I am a recent stay at home mom and it has helped to minimize my time in the kitchen. I have cooked everything from fish, to steak, to grilled veggies and they have all come out great. It cooks so quickly and evenly and clean up can not be much easier. Just pull out the plates and wipe them clean. It took a little to get use to the fact that it does cook so quickly. Food can go from not done to over done in less than a minute. So, done walk away. Overall, this grill is fantastic."
5,Works Great,"Works very well, use it 4 to 5 times per week and clean up is a snap. Much better then the old Foreman grill I replaced that I had for years."
3,it works,i purchased this as a replacement for a george forman grill. i find the grill plates get to hot and the coating on them is of poor quality.
1,Not hot enough,"We have a first generation GF grill that we really like except for cleaning and our family has outgrown it, so we were looking for something bigger. We chose this model and used it to cook burgers. Followed the instructions for preheating but still there was very little sizzle when the burgers went on and the heating light never came on again until the burgers were cooked through. By then they were gray and without any searing like we get from the first gen model. I cooked lean turkey burgers (3 small burgers totaling 10 oz.) and the drip tray was nearly full - not with fat, but juices that should have stayed in the burgers had they actually seared. Very disappointing."
5,What a change it is! Simple clean up now!,"Whew! What a relief it is now. The removeable plates have finally made it a painless clean up process. You can simply toss it under the water and scrub her down and {POOF!} she's clean no more hassling with the older models, or simply toss it in the dish washer and it's clean. Nice!Same old grill, but a nice upgrade in the cleaning process."
4,A good product-plates removable!,"I bought this George Foreman Grill to replace the older, smaller grill which I have that still works fine. I needed a larger grill that could fit multiple items (like 2-3 burgers or steaks), and that was easier to clean up.This grill fit the bill perfectly!The only drawback I can identify is that, as other reviewers mention, it does seem to take longer to heat up, but that's a small price to pay for the fact that the grill plates are removable and much easier to wash. I can just let them soak in the sink, and clean them up in a snap later. The grill does heat up sufficiently, I would say approximately 10-12 minutes to be at a nice hot temperature. Overall, the performance is just as good as my older, smaller George Foreman. Being picky, but I wish the cord was a little longer, but that's usually the case with all small appliances."
5,Excellent product,I have been using a smaller George Foreman grill for a couple of years but wanted one with removable plates for easier cleaning.This new grille works very well and is very convenient to clean since the plates can be removed and placed in the dish washer.I am very satisfied with the productWesley
5,The review of a public school world history teacher,"While all of Dave Stotts' episodes may not be ideal for a public school classroom (too christianity-centric), they are all interesting, entertaining, educational and come with top-notch production quality. This is not a talking head video series!Episode #3 of this disk (Phoenicians, Carthage, gladiators, etc.) does a great job of reviewing Roman history and covers how Christianity represented a break from Roman values in a professional (non-conversion-seeking) manner. Episode #3 will most likely wind up in the end of unit review of my rather lenghty Roman Empire chapter.The other sections will be welcome at my home and my adult Bible study classes.I give this series a solid ""A"""
1,It's certainly not history,"This series was just more pseudo scientific propaganda put out by a media company that specializes in creating mis-information videos for a supposedly Christian point of view. The videos are full of factual errors and try to lean history to prove a particularly evangelical point of view. These should have been released on PTL, for entertainment purposes only, and not the History Channel. Certainly, any high school student could point out oll of the factual errors in the series."
3,Good Enough,"It is a good colection of Hollies music. It has ""Bus Stop"" and ""Carrie Anne"" but the song it's really missing is ""Listen to me"""
3,Still has some issues,No matter what I tried it doesn't work for websites. It works great with logon and programs like AIM but if you are looking for something that handles the passwords for all your different websites you should wait for them to get it right.
5,The cure for office politics,"I've been a legal assistant at the same firm for seven years. The lawyers are actually okay but my boss is the office manager from hell. She is completely psycho. This book helped me figure why, and what to do about her. Read it!"
4,good book,a large part of the battles of the American revolution took place in south carolina. It is a good read
4,The other review has one inaccuracy,"I just received my lens, and I read the instructions. You have to use your zoom button and zoom all the way out in order to get a full picture. This is the first thing noted in the instructions. If you don't, you will, as the other review said, get a picture that only fills the center of the view--the rest will be black. It definitely pays to read the instructions. This is actually a good tool--I took a few pictures of the same shot with and without, and the extra zoom is significant."
3,A cute book!,"Forever Friends is the simple story of a young boy, Petey and his dog, Skip. Petey tells the reader about his dog and how he cares for and what he teaches Skip. It's so cute that Petey does wonderful things for Skip and some of them just happen to be the things that Petey enjoys doing also.The illustrations are well drawn but are overly busy. I began to feel a little schizoid looking at themArmchair Interviews says: Children can learn a lesson reading this book. Petey takes responsibility for Skip and that's an important lesson. It's a cute book and children will enjoy the story."
5,"Great Quality, Low Price","I was looking for a cabinet knob with some ""personality"" for cabinetry in a room designated strictly to crafts/music. This knob filled that need perfectly. Lots of style, good quality and low price. If the look appeals to you, you will be happy purchasing it."
2,Not reliable,"When it works it works good, but if you leave it on for more than an hour even if not connected to it, the soud quality just sounds like pure static. You can barley even here what is playing. I haven't tried it as a transmitter yet only as a reciever for my mac book. I have to turn it off for a while then turn it back on and it sounds good. but can't even watch a movie without having to pause and turn it of for a while."
1,Doesn't work as well as expected,I bought this transceiver to listen to music and watch movies while on the treadmill. The treadmill is right in front of the TV (and the transmitter) and the audio constantly cuts in and out. I'm frustrated enough that I'd like to return this item but I think I've had it too long. Might look for something else instead.
4,Good value for the money,"This is a second one I bought to stream TV sound to Bluetooth earphones with TV speakers turned off. I needed two of them, because it can be paired with only one set of earphones at a time, and if two people want to listen with two sets of earphones, you need two adapters. It has a good range, I can hear it in any section of the house. It could deliver a little louder signal, but I can still reach a desirable sound level by turning up the earphone volume. The quality of sound is very good, but it has a fraction of a second delay, which is typical for all bluetooth adapters."
3,AN AVERAGE DIGITAL THERMOMETER,"I BOUGHT THIS PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT WAS THE LONGEST DIGITAL THERMOMETER THAT I COULD FIND. IT HAS SOME NICE FEATURES (LIKE STORING SETTINGS) THAT I'LL PROBABLY NEVER USE. MY MAIN ISSUE IS THAT IT READS SLOWLY, TAKING A LONG TIME TO GET TO THE TEMPERATURE OF THE MEAT. I'VE HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH OTHER DIGITALS TOO. SOMETIMES IT IS SO SLOW THAT YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY PASSED YOUR CHOSEN TEMPERATURE. IF THERE IS A WAY TO COMPENSATE FOR THIS WITH DIGITAL THERMOMETERS IN GENERAL I HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET AND I'LL CONTINUE TO RELY ON TIMING MY MEAT BY SO MANY MINUTES A SIDE ON A PARTICULAR HEAT."
1,Leaves a lot to be desired,"I've been using this litter box for about a year. The first thing I did was discard the plastic liner; my cats shredded it. I've been struggling with this thing leaking and today was the last straw - urine was all behind and under the litter box. Apparently my cats ""aim high"" and the urine just pours out of the litter box as it hits the seam where the top and bottom meet - especially in the back where the steps end. Yes, I make sure the cover is tightly attached every time I clean it (twice a day). I just tossed it (what a waste of money) and purchased a traditional covered litter box that I know will not leak. To say I am disappointed is putting it mildly. I could not recommend this litter box."
3,Not for my cat.,"Purchased for our 11 year old male cat who weighs in at about 10 lbs. It didn't work for us because the area inside is too small to keep clean. We would have had to remove and replace the cover every time he used it in order to keep it clean. Plus, he would urinate on the side, which would flow down the ramp and mix with his trackings. This would be great for a kitten or for someone who cleans the cat box more than 2x per day."
4,Stops the tracking,"Pretty effective at keeping the litter from tracking. We've got a stinky little guy and the cover and charcoal don't do much to help that. A little flimsy on the sides, so it always takes me a minute to get the lid back on after scooping. Overall, a vast improvement over a standard box."
2,Great looks but risky to use,"It looks bigger then it is since the stairs are within the dome. My cats bump the cover when they move inside and sometimes the lid comes off slighly and number ones hit the liner and leak out the side...definately not good.They do love the privacy, but I am constantly worrying that the top won't stay secure."
4,Booda Dome Cleanstep Cat Box,"I'm happy with the cleanstep box, I thought it would have been a bit bigger but I'm happy, I have 2 cats and as the cats come out from the litter box, I do not have to sweep the floor after each time."
2,Buyer beware...,"We purchased the Booda Cleanstep and loved it!!! Until we started having to buy liners which have became increasingly difficult to source. Booda brand was rarely available and the other brands never fit right. Litter changes often involved collapsed liners, taping ill fitting bags, spilled litter and a lot of frustration. So disappointed we couldn't keep the Booda around. We've gone back to the traditional box and wondered why we waited so long!"
2,"Great, except arrived broken.","I highly recommend this style litter box for anyone, it helps tremendously with tracking litter, and is larger than the regular domes. The only complaint I have is that the charcoal filter flap was broken when I received it, I ended up taping to to the top to keep it closed because I didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back in the HUGE box it came in (think xmas tree size). So please know it's a great product, I just marked down because it was broken upon receiving."
2,Not Quite What I Hoped For,"The longer I have had this box the more faults with it I find. First off it is no better containing litter than any other box I have used.Yes the steps catch some of the litter, but not enough to prevent a good floor vacuming several times a day. The actual area where you pour the litter is smaller than most boxes and worst of all the cats although standing in the litter maydeficate or urinate on the steps themselves making for a messy cleanup. I am on the verge of ridding myself of this gimmick and purchasing the good old standard box."
4,Great product for us all,I had a few of these sent and returned to me. They are not shipped with good packaging but when we finally gave up and went to the store to purchase them we bought a few of them. We all love them. Very little tracking and smells that get out...
4,Still smells,"I bought this littler box for my kitten. We use Scoopable Feline Pine and before it would be tracked all over the house. After I purchased the Clean Step Booda Dome, the tracking has been reduced SIGNIFICANTLY! I also but an old bathmat underneath it, so it captures even more of the pine. My cat took to it right away and seems to love it. It has lots of room for him. We used the line that came in the box. The cat did not rip it, but he still managed to get litter under the liner, so we will not be using the liner again. It will be easier to just clean the box. I haven't had any problems with leaking urine, maybe because my cat is only three month old. The filters don't seem to help much with odor control. The poop still smells. Also my husband complained about how the top and bottom attach. They should install clips on the side for better hold."
2,"Too small, does not work well at all.","The seller was prompt with shipping and for that I am thankful. However, this product stinks. We bought in hopes we could get our old cat to stop peeing outside of her box but, she hangs out over the steps instead and the pee runs down them like a river. She is not a big cat but this litter box is too small for her. I had such high hopes. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,purrrfect!,"This is the perfect litter box, it's cute, easy to keep clean, perfect size for my 2 cats. They like it and so do I!"
5,Works well for cat with cerebellar hypoplasia,I bought this box for my cat with cerebellar hypoplasia in the hopes that it would make her more self sufficient in the litter box. It works very well. The ramp allows her to access the box easily and when inside the box she can lean against the high walls to steady herself. I would highly recommend it for use with a cat with a disability such as cerebellar hypoplasia.
2,Not so awesome,"I bought this because I thought it would cut down on litter tracking, and I liked the appearance of it. However, it was not as wonderful as I thought it would be. Not only is it difficult to scoop because of the rounded sides, it is a PAIN to empty, even with the liners because my cat likes to scratch endlessly, thus shredding them. So I end up pouring used cat litter all over my floor trying to pour it into the trash can. However, my 2 cats used it just as easily as a regular litter box."
4,Not quite a 5-star but close,"I have one cat in a very small 2BR. Conventional litter box had litter all over the house. This product works great for keeping litter in the dome (and on the mat I upgraded to) and you can't smell cat at all. Two detractions: 1. Size: it's pretty big and takes up a bit a space. 2. Litter bags. No matter how hard I try, I can't get the whole thing tucked in before the dome goes on. I ended up using some packing tape to hold it down in a couple of places. Maybe I'm placing it incorrectly, but it always leaves a gap somewhere. Otherwise, I like the product a lot."
5,3 years later still the best,"I now have 4 adult cats and a new kitten that we rescued from the sid eof the road, and this litter box is the favorite of all my cats. Mainly cause it is so large. The steps do a ""good"" not great job catching the litter. An extra mat just outside the entrance fixes that though. I bought this box when I got my first cat 3 years ago and it is still used constantly. I would reccomend this to anyone!"
2,You Get What You Pay For,"We ordered this product to help us keep our litter box area free of stray litter kicked out by the cat, and we think it will do that, but there were some problems with the order. First, the item came only in an Amazon box with some paper filler. Upon inspection, the filter compartment latch appeared to have been broken and it would not close. Second, the litter box was supposed to include a filter and a liner, per the description (""Comes with a free filter and liner in each box."") however, these items were not in the box. We contacted Amazon customer service, but the only options required a return, which is a big hassle for this plastic item. At least Customer Service gave us a 10% discount, and the initial price seemed a good value, since the regular price at PetCo is about $50. Basically, you get what you pay for, and some things are better purchased at an actual store. Kudos to Amazon for at least trying."
1,"Big, clunky and intimidating",I got this litter box b/c when we decided to adopt a cat we had no idea where we would hide a litter box so this one appeared that it would be great for our new baby and not so hard on the eyes. It's horrible! It's Huge and the poor cat will not even go inside to check it out. Not to mention that it's broken and I can't find a box big enough to ship it back in. $15.00 at walmart=Large covered box and happy kitty!!!
4,Not so bad for price,I have always had lots of issues with litter on the floor. I have two cats and they seem to compete to see who can bring the most litter out of the box. This litter box has been the best I have ever had- 95% of the litter stays inside! It has no problem fitting my overly plump cat nor my abnormally long cat. Over all good product for the price you pay.
5,It Works!,"My cats were leary at first, then I made sure they had a light source as suggested in an esrlier review. Soon It turned into the favorite ""potty"" for Moms and kittens. The design does help with smell and debris. The filter fell out untill I put velcro on the filter and the holder. Overall the product works as advertised. (I bought another one)"
3,"A good concept, poor implementation","I have an 18-lb cat and a 12-lb cat. This box is big enough for them, but it takes up a lot of floor space. The stairs do a good job of catching litter, but they don't come out to dump the litter from the stairs. This is a real problem when one of the cats hangs their butt over the edge and urinates. The litter on the stairs absorbs the urine and we end up with an odoriferous, crusty mess that you either have to vacuum up, or dump the whole litter box to get rid of. This box would be so much better if you could remove the stairs to clean them."
3,Watch your cat first,"I bought this litter box to eliminate litter tracking and control the odor. It solved these problems but started some new ones. My cat refused to use the box and instead just peeped and pooped on the steps or at the box instead of in it. So, if you want mine, just email me pdiannet@hotmail.com"
2,MISSING PIECES!!!!!,I purchased this item and it came without the filter piece that goes in the top of the littler box. As this was one of the main reasons that I purchased this litter box...I am very disappointed in it.
1,"Badly designed, much too small, VERY messy and unwieldy.","This litter box sucks. I had to throw it in the dumpster after using it for ONE DAY. It's too small, even as a secondary litter box my big female cat made a huge mess of herself trying to use it, the top kept coming off (it is not attached at all!), it doesn't keep odor away even with the filter, the ""ramp"" is a total gimmick, litter consistently goes in the cracks of the device, the stairs, EVERYWHERE really. This thing is a total piece of garbage. TOTAL, UTTER, COMPLETE GARBAGE."
3,Would be Nice if Description & Item Matched,"When I purchased this item I knew the pictures were switched between the Pearl and the ""Titanium"" which the picture showed as being a grey color but what I did not count on was that the actual color ""Titanium"" for this particular product is NOT Grey in color but BEIGE!!! Now I have a GIANT Booda Litter box that doesn't match anything!!"
4,"Worth the buy, but a little bulky","I have 2 cats, one that is unusually small (6 pounds, fully grown and healthy)and one that is unusually large (21 pounds)... this litter box does the job, it keeps MOST of the litter inside the box, and it reduces smell A LOT. I was amazed at how roomy it is... my big cat has no trouble at all getting in and out of it, and she even has the room to turn around in it.The only drawback to this box is that it is very awkward... the lid doesn't snap on, so moving it to clean around it is difficult, and it is quite bulky, and (of course) cannot be wedged into a corner, due to its shape.Overall, this is a good buy. Based on the reduction of mess and smell, this is the best I've found yet."
2,Ok- if your cat consistently uses the litterbox,"This litterbox is ok, but only if you have a cat that consistently uses the litter box. The covered dome and especially the stair design will deter a kitty with weak litter motivation. It's a bit too small, and so your cat (like mine) may simply decide they don't want to use this/don't want the trouble of figuring their way in and out.I have an older cat and I would absolutely not recommend this for geriatric kitties. She seemed perplexed and used the bathtub instead."
1,Booda Dome Fails Leak Test,"The Booda Dome cat box seems like a great idea. However we have a cat that urinates high in the litter box and the Booda Box failed to keep the urine inside. After the third time of finding urine on the floor, I am getting rid of it. Apparently the urine gets into the track and drips outside the box."
2,doesnt live up to the claims!,"The Booda looks good and is large .However I bought this purely as one of the features advertised is that it will stop your pet dogs from accessing the litter.It doesnt!The litter is hidden round the corner and up the slope so the dogs cant just put their heads as with normal hooded litter trays .BUT the lid and base are totally loose, dog puts head in entrance, raises head, lid comes off and dog scatters litter everywhere.The lid and base NEED some sort of clip and I have resorted to luggage straps round base and lid which has had dome success.So if you are buying this very expensive litter box thinking it will solve this particular problem - then dont buy it - we are no better off"
2,smelly litter on stairs,This is no were like the Boda max that was truly order free. Cats use it littler gets on the steps and floor box smells .No matter what kind of litter you use. Even if you scoop each day like I do. Not worth the money. Please bring the boda max back.
5,A Roark for Structural Engrs,"I can't say enough about this book. However, you may hate this book just based on the fact that you'll end up throwing away a handful of your ol tried n trusty references after getting it. It is that comprehensive. I haven't opened my Roark's since I got it. Roark does a good job of providing info that's useful to mechanical and structural engineers, but this was obviously conceived from the get-go with structural engineering in mind (though its written by a mechanical engring professor).I have no qualms stating that this is THE new reference text for non-material (steel, concrete, etc) structural engineering. Need a generic stiffness matrix for a tapered beam with spring supports? Got it. How about plates on elastic foundations, or do you need 100 pages of tabulated internal forces, deflections and dynamic properties of thin-shells of revolution? Got it.You won't regret shelling out the cash for this one..."
5,A must have,"This is a nice compilation of drinks. The book features all the necessary information on glasses,trimmings,mixing and even party-planning. This book is suited to both the professional mixologist as well as the simple social drinker looking for some new ideas."
3,Good But Not What Ordered,"I have nerve damage in my hands ,so what I use for strings is limited. I ordered .008-.047 strings and received 010-047. Was in a hurry an didn't notice the difference till I had them installed. Now I'm stuck till I can order new ones , (from someone else probably )"
1,Very disappointed!!!,"This item looks great in the pictures on Amazon. I was very disappointed that the ""power"" strips are only good for two pronged appliances, most of mine are three pronged. It does hold a microwave nicely, but most other small appliances require being able to lift off or out of the base unit; as in a blender, crock pot, electric pressure cooker, etc. And, NO the pull-out shelf is not strong enough to hold these small appliances adequately when full of liquid or food items to do this, so I end up having to take the entire unit off of the cart to load and unload the appliance with food/liquid. It looks great, but is not the multi-purpose roller cart I had wanted for my kitchen!!!"
2,An illution of simplicity,"I find this book rather poorly structured. The authors have not decided if this is a book for developers or for administrators, and they try to make it a book for both. I think they have ended ut writing a book for nobody.All code fragments need another look. I know that they are not intended for a compiler, but I think they should at least look that way.As in most TUXEDO documentation the authors have a hard time getting to the point. Technical computer litterature can be a lot more pedagogic and easy to read than this!"
3,Covers a lot with tons of Acronyms - Confusing,"There is a lot of information. Unfortunately there are hundreds of acronyms, most of them specific to Tuxedo programming. It becomes tedious boring reading as more later terms are described in older terms/acronyms. There are some diagrams but I did not find them particularly useful. Mostly architectural descriptions. Not a lot of working examples. Again, the reading is dry, but I'm not sure there is a better alternative out there on this topic."
3,not compatible as amazon says,"the socket doesn't compatible with Buick lacrosse 2005 cxl, have to return it. BTW, the printing on the 02 shows Denso, but package is acdelco, item# is the same though."
5,Convincing theory and case studies,"This book makes the case that you can't understand Islamic violence without understanding the repressive environments of Muslims. It rejects several theories like economic impoverishment, ideology, or jihad as explanations of why Muslims turn to violence. When people are excluded from politics and repressed brutally, it makes sense that some will turn to violence. The book's limitation is that the author does not explain why Muslims turn against the West (especially the US) or why some repressive countries don't have violence like some of his case studies: Algeria, Egypt, Kashmir, Philippines, Tajikistan, and Chechnya. Having said that, it is still the best explanation I've read so far."
1,amazing how quickly they discharge,"I have 3 cell phones: Mexico; US, and Europe.I thought my Mexican OEM battery was near death, so I bought another - I have to charge them every day!What a joke!"
5,! TO THE GOVERNMENT,"IT IS A VERY GOOD BOOK! I WONDER WHY YOUR GOVERNMENT HAS LOOSEN THE BELT? A SCHOLAR IN PRC HAVE HAD THE SAME IDEA(WITH STUDY IN PRC) 5 YEARS AGO,EVEN GAVE USA AS AN EXAMPLE! BUT NOW! IT IS HORRIBLE TO LET THE COMMERCIAL BANK TO DO NON-COMMERCIAL BANK BUSINESS. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO PRO.DYMSKI`S ANSWER.THAMK YOU!"
2,This is not the product i was looking for.,I wanted the playtex binkis that they stopped making. my son is 4 years old and he is autistic. he has mouthing issues and playtex stopped making the only one he would use. the picture was blurry and i paid for 3-5 business days shipping. it took 3 weeks for it to get to me. my son lost so much sleep and me for weeks. i didn't even get what i wanted.
4,Lite Source,This lamp is absolutely beutiful. It has 3 light settings and the light is much brighter than traditional desk lamps. Delivery was speedy.
1,Still small for the phone,"the case was nice, but it did not fit my phone - so they still have it small for the phone"
1,What in the world?,This is the worst movie ever. I have only seen the first 2 minutes of it and it is already the stupidist thing ever made by man. Do not watch this dirt.
2,Not a bit like books. Stunk.,This is the first & second episode. They both stunk!!!! I would never pay 14.95 for something this retarded. I wouldn't pay a dollar.
2,"Animorphs, The Invasion Series","The movie (or small episodes on one video) was quite disappointing. I am a HUGE fan of the book series, Animorphs, by K.A. Applegate so I decided to check out the movie in the library. The movie was a horrible. The actors were much older than the characters in the book. The actors did not portray the characters they were playing very well. The Andalites were completely fake looking and the movie strayed more from the basic book plot than I would have liked. I thought maybe the people who made the movie might have put the episdes in order instead of skipping around. There were some switched roles and completely messed up personalities. All in all, I wouldn't recommend buying the movie if you want to save money. Try renting or borrowing it."
4,entertaining flick,I thought the story was good and it kept me guessing because of all of the twists and turns. I especially liked the hotel room stuff. It reminded me of True Romance and Reservior Dogs.
2,I have low standards and this was STILL kind of terrible even for me.,"I just needed the cheapest way to finish off my costume. This wig is...really gross. I don't think I could use it for anything unless my costume was ""Lady with a Really Terrible Cheap Wig"". I went to the party store by the mall and got a slightly better one instead. I don't know what I was expecting, I mean it WAS redonkulously cheap."
2,Fact or Fiction,"This book is really for the Soviet cognesceti since it does not have enough rigor and scholarship to qualify as a primary text. Nevertheless, it is a measure of the ""through the looking glass"" criminality of the Soviet experiment that the reader is constantly asking whether the author's account could be true. A quick read but ""Caution-Thin Ice"" Perhaps better to stick with Amy Knight, R. Conquest, Volkoganov pending corroboration."
4,Didn't use,Have not dug into this and sold the text book soon after purchased. Not sure if it isn't my style or what?
1,Practically Unreadable,"I'm sorry, I really hate to give a bad review, but I had a very hard time reading this book. I'm a copy editor, so I just couldn't get past the bad punctuation, grammar, and writing. I know it's automatic writing and that I should expect that it might be a little convoluted, but it's extremely convoluted. Perhaps an editor could have cleaned it up some, but that might take away some of the authenticity I suppose."
5,Awesome !,"The movie is excellent, intense, innovative. Nine aspects of human being anallysed in a very interesting perspective. The image (really High Definition) and sound are great. It's one of my favorites."
5,Loved this movie!! 5 stars-plus!!!,"so good a story! So true...we are all just a number...and rag dolls-up against ""THE MACHINE""....in all truths too many times what had started for the good of man got into the wrong evil hands...think about it..make sure to watch the commentary, which explains MUCH!! I hope to own this one some day soon. Rented from Netflix & watched the movie, then the commentary & then watched again. Second time of course I got more out of it, which helped to bring my rating of 5 stars---PLUS some!!! This film is great for all ages. One you could watch w/ whole family-even parents. Tim Burton you did it again-another fine masterpiece!!! Cant wait to make this a well deserved purchase. May God help to save us from evil....."
3,Post-apocalyptic world,"This is more of 3.5 stars.The story was interesting and intriguing. But ultimately, not much happened. The ending made me sad. I think it's worth watching just for the novel concepts."
5,Mature animation,"This is not for kids. Americans usually assume that an animated feature is for little kids. This movie clearly is not for little children. But I think that from 5th grade up ought to be ok with 9.for the rest of us ""9"" is a good tight to the point piece of story telling with great scoring and it is visually a knock-out. Buy it and put it on your ""art house"" shelf.Read the critic's reviews to see what it is about. But don't let anything deter you from enjoying a great piece of film animation."
4,Amos - 4.5 stars and a thought-provoking thrill ride,"Although I do agree that this film seemed shorter than it could have been, Acker and Burton along with Elfman on the soundtrack effectively presented the classic, moral dilemmas that evoke unavoidable, emotional involvement charactaristic of hit anime films such as Steamboy, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, and Princess Mononoke to name a few examples. The conflict between hiding and fighting for the better of the group, self-sacrifice to save the whole, the human conscience of right and wrong, and of course, friendship and loyalty really made this film easy to relate to (as long as you are 13+ of age). The overall dark look of the war-torn desolation of the world in which ""9"" takes place makes the plentiful appearance of colorful fight scenes and metaphysical events even more memorable.I would recommend this film to any who have any liking for anime-style storytelling, post-apocalyptic settings, and deep moral conflict."
2,Wholly lacking,"This animated film has a lot of potential. But that's just it. Potential. It fails at almost everything it attempts and leaves viewers left wondering, ""What's the point?"""
2,Best bits ..,"The first 7 minutes and the last 7 minutes of credits.If you like a movie with random animation about nothing in particular .. endless narrow escapes and nice music, this is the movie for you.Please do not insert brain before settling down.Oh yes, and the ending is a disaster.So much potential .. so little thought."
1,The item did not work,The DVD did not play and the seller said it was too later to return it........so be sure to watch all DVD's you purchase immediately!!!!!!
1,Has anyone who's posted a review actually watched the blu-ray disc??,"I'd love to be able to have anything to say about this piece of garbage but the disc won't even run in my player. Does everything but play the movie. So I'm the owner of a $25 coaster. I'll be seeking a refund on this ASAP. If anyone got the disc to work I'd love to know how.btw, would have given it ""0"" stars but Amazon wants a rating, so I gave it 1 star."
5,A powerful message for the subconscious,It wasn't until after I watched the movie that I started to understand the plot. It hit me when I wasn't paying attention and was amazed at how powerful the story is. This is a must see with your partner as it shows a boy growing into a man and the strength of a woman to fight to protect others. It is very political in the sense that beings must unite and deal with a leader whose vision no longer serves the community they are responsible and whose outdated leadership skills only serve to destroy their own cavitations.
4,Good but not great.,"I went into this movie not expecting a whole lot and not knowing a ton about it and was impressed at the beginning by the visuals and great voice overs but the story line to it took some time to develop. After the movie was over I was wanting more. ""9"" makes your imagination go wild, each time the story brings in something new you think of all the characters and realize how they fit in the movie and then at the end of the movie you imagine what the next scene would be if there was one.""9"" is a great movie to watch once, but with this types of movies in my opinion are all about the first time you watch. Once you know whats going to happen and the story to it the next time you watch it will be sub par, the story and how its delivered really makes this movie."
3,Well done,"I picked up this book with one goal in mind: cure myself of my own tendency to watch the talk shows. Not so much Springer/Stern, etc.., but the Sunday a.m. and evening politcial shows - particularly Crossfire. And this book definitely accomplished that goal.The most striking thing to me is how disingenuous this whole culture has become. Anything to get on TV seems to be the theme. We have always made that comment when watching some buffoon on Jenny Jones expose their sad life for all the world. Now we can add Robert Novak, et.al., to the list. They just go about it in a more high-minded manner and expose their self-righteous beliefs and attitudes.If these shows really cared about content, they would have more objective hosts and panelists. But it's entertainment and so we get Sam Donaldson and John McLaughlin.Oh well, I'm cured.On the other hand, it was slightly tedious at times (like the shows themselves) because there is only so much one can say about this genre."
2,Save your money,"Save your money,even if it's only $4.99. I can't understand why artist change the way they sing a song when the original is what made them famous."
1,Save Your Money For The Originals,"This CD features the original duo, but these are re-recordings of their songs, NOT the original sixties recordings. Don't buy this unless you must have every recording the group ever made."
3,Teamwork crushes the bully,"A story I read as a child soon after it was written in 1945. I found the book in our basement, and have now introduced my grandson to it. It has all the features of a classic: small hero with a huge heart and much courage, meets another outcast. Together, they gather courage and challenge the bully of the forest...and THEY WIN!!! The bully has a great name (Thunderclap) and the names of the two heroes and not shabby either: Morris and Balsam. I must have enjoyed it as a kid because I remembered it all these years and now my grandson is enthralled. I don't think it is available anywhere. Pity."
3,fashionable fatigue hat,"For the price, the hat is well made. However it does not hold a shape very well because the fabric is not substantial enough. I guess my opinion is influenced by my memories of my old army issue hat which could actually hold water."
1,Trite work of fiction,"After having read many great books in my life, I have come to realize one thing about today's movement towards mass market fiction...in most cases you can hardly ever find a good book! The same can be said for TJ McGregor's work ""The Other Extreme."" The book's characters and plot, while sometimes showing flashes of glory and interest, are nothing more then the amalgamation of other characters from a host of different books. If you can, pick up a copy of a literary classic like ""Great Expectations"" or ""Of Mice And Men"" to show what an author can do to bring characters to life, and to make an even sometimes convoluted plot make sense. But stay away from this type of fiction! It's not worth your time!"
4,Snow Crystals,"Snow is the most unstable substance on Earth - it is always changing - while forming, falling and on the ground. These images and introduction to snow crystals are excellent. It is advisable to also purchase Bently's book of snowflake photographs. This is an introduction to snow crystals, not a snow crystal science text.The only thing missing are electronmicrophotographs of snow crystals - available on the web. There are many snow science texts available. This book is for fun."
4,Snow flakes,I purchased this book for my wife as she loves snowflakes and she was not disappointed. This book has very detailed scientific information about snowflakes and has many wonderful pictures. Definitely not a childs book.
2,not as expected,"this ""sand"" is so fine that it continually clouds up your tank... washed it off and put it in tank, instantly the tank is cloudy. next morning, a lot better, but still a little dirty/cloudy to it. stirred it up, emptied the cloudy water out of 3/4 of the 55 gallon tank, filled with clear water and still does the same time... like I said, I think the sand is just so fine that it floats around in the water and gives it a cloudy appearance."
4,Good,"I wish it was slightly more user friendly but, it's informative. Shipped quickly. Why do we have to write a certain amount of words???? That's dumb :)"
4,Wisdom of the ages,"This book condenses a lot of AA and Al-Anon thought into a few fast-reading pages. It contains many handy tools and techniques for managing difficult emotions and letting go of the need to control others.I don't believe it's just for people in AA and Al-Anon. The wisdom in its pages is universal, although the constant references to AA and Al-Anon might put off an average reader.I want to share this book with many people, to give them a taste of what serenity -- emotional independence -- feels like.I highly recommend the book as a companion text to other program literature. It does not replace the Big Book or Paths to Recovery, but it condenses and clarifies a lot of age-old wisdom in a few easy-to-read pages."
5,Christmas Classic!,"I watched this as a child & loved it & I'm so glad it's back for more generations to love! My 18 month old son loves this movie & watches it over & over. He is glued to the tv when this is on & dances to the music. Unfortunately, Elmo is not in this, but all the original Sesame Street characters are. This brings back great memories & I love starting new ones with my family. It's a cute story that starts when Oscar tells Big Bird that Santa can't fit down the chimney so there will be no presents on Christmas morning. So Big Bird goes on a mission to find out how Santa gets down the chimney. The music in this movie is great & it's so much fun to watch!"
5,A classic,"This is a great family Christmas movie. We had it in videocassette and I'm thrilled to find it as a dvd. The hairstyles and clothes date the movie of course, but the muppets are eternal. Cookie monster has a great role. We have no youngsters in the famiy any more, but we still watch it every Christmas."
4,Great Family Video,This video has meant a lot to my wife when she was a child and now it will become a great tradition in our family to watch this during the Christmas Holiday.
4,Seems ok right out of the gate,"The trigger on the bottle is small and it's annoying to use. If you're going to spray a big garden, you'll want to use this stuff in a spray bottle with a much longer trigger.I tried this today on some potatoes which have been recently hit by some kind of bug. Stay tuned for details.Possibly not the most effective spray I've ever used on my garden. I like the Safer brand name. But this doesn't seem to work terribly well.--Update: I think my problem was RABBITS and not bugs, so I can't complain about this stuff."
3,Environmentally Good,"I wanted something to spray on my vegetables that did not contain harsh chemicals. This product contains natural Pyrethrins to protect from insects. This summer has been especially harsh with heat, grasshoppers, etc., and so far my tomato plants are unscathed. The main reason I'm giving it just 3 stars is because the pump sprayer on the bottle is made from SUCH cheap, breakable, lightweight plastic -- I suspect I'll have to replace it with another."
2,Very disappointing!,"I've just proven that the cliche ""don't judge a book by its cover"" is very true especially in this book. I've bought this book because of its cute cover and interesting plot. When I've finished reading it, I was really disappointed. Toby is not funny, she's weird. I think some scenes were written just to increase the book's pages. The twist was ok but not satisfying. I would rather have Toby end up with the other guy.In short, I have had better."
2,Disappointing.,"Bottom line: Some insightful passages, spinkled with funny punch-lines, but quite disappointing in the end.I picked up a galley (ie: no cover art to clue me in), hoping to discover something about the toy industry which I'm intrigued about. Only to realize that the story line was mainly focused on the love life of the main character. I have nothing against beautiful, insightful, breath-taking, mysterious, adventurous, well-written love stories. But this book has none of that. I did enjoy the first 200 pages, then became annoyed with the repetitive, stretched-out plot, until I gave up and skipped to the conclusion only to discover how poorly thought-out it was.Not worth the reading time."
5,Wonderful!!!,"My grandkids, three and five, who watch scooby doo some of time when they come over, love watching this movie. They like watching the ""real"" characters, they don't mind the cartoons either but they like the story line on this one. But give them ""Scooby Doo"" anytime."
3,Shoe finish doesn't hold up!,"These shoes are comfortable but... I bought them for casual wear, hoping to replace a pair of a same style different brand that is aging. The Deer Stags marked up the first few minutes I wore them, and only by turning my toes over again carpet while sitting. They have continued to mark very easily. The color just comes off!. It doesn't seem to get on stuff, but I have to put a bit of polish/cream and rub it in almost each time I wear them or they look bad. So I have made them the 2nd pair, wearing them and trying to extend the life of the ones I hoped to replace.If appearance of the shoe is of no concern to you, the comfort of the shoe is worth the purchase, but be cautioned about the wear issues"
1,Save your money!,This CD is absolutely awful. It is so bad that it is pretty obvious that the people that released it had a lot more to gain than the artists that it represents.
4,A creepy tale,"Nine year old Katie has a secret admirer. The problem is, she's the only one who has seen him, and his attention is unrelenting and increasingly sinister. Britt, Katie's mom, believes that something is wrong, but can't convince her husband or the local police that her child is in very real danger. This one is a classic nail-biter that will leave you angry/scared and up all night with the lights on."
1,Not Interesting,"I read this book on a cold winters day hoping to get deep into a book. But it's too superficial and unorginal that I thought I had heard this story many times. I do realize that these books are written in a short amount of time, that took no effort, can be interesting, but not in this case. Sunfire books are the same and not the least bit interesting. Everyone out find a classic to read."
3,"superficial, but ""feel-good-reading""","I admit, I don't usually read this type of book, but this time, I needed a really, really! light read. I almost didn't read the whole thing, because Amanda was quite annoying in the beginning, but she got better as the trip to Oregon progressed. Of course, Amanda is the sort of cliche book that I usually scorn, but hey! go ahead and read it; there's a nice, happy ending."
5,Insect book,This book proved its worth immediately. I saw a bug that I wasn't familiar with and with the help of the book I was able to identify it.
1,Too General Too much is missing,"If you really want to ID insects in your yard or garden, I dont think that this is the book to use. It is way to general containing insects from desert, the south and the north, it omits many families and includes many exotics that are unique but not likely to be found. A more regional focus would help and a more complete key would also help. It just seems that they tried to do to much with the pages they had. As far as an alternative, I am still looking for a better key/field book."
1,Disappointing for a Canadian,"I've recently taken up macro photography & wanted to be able to find info about the insects that I'm shooting around the Montreal area.Perhaps this guide might be good for someone in the US, but it's certainly lacking a LOT for us Canadians. Out of the 10 insects that I've searched for so far~ I've found one."
5,'what's that bug?',"Another in the Audobon Field Guides series. Very useful guide, great pictures and text. Includes spiders, caterpillars, butterflies, moths, and lots of interesting critters."
3,"OK, disturbing in spots and major lags.","This is supposed to be a movie that is kid friendly, but the pictures of an old half-naked fat guy throwing shoes and food at a woman were not the kind of scenes I would consider very appropriate. Kids see enough domestic violence in their homes to be reminded of it at school. The dialogue is at times hard to understand and there are some major lags in the action that really bog things down. The final scene was good except Beethoven would not have continued to conduct his own composition after it was finished. he would have known when it was done. The scene with the boy in the country gave some insight to his psyche that was valuable to understanding his behavior.If you want to show students some good videos of this genre, I recommend the Composer's Special series."
1,"So bad, it's funny","This DVD is so horrifically bad, it almost has comic value. Ridiculous costumes, pretty much zero plot, and the acting is shamefully bad. We did however, laugh our buns off at some of the scenes. I don't think the movie was intended to provide comic value, and we almost felt bad. But if you are the type who likes to sit in airports and secretly snicker at the poorly dressed/behaved people there, this movie may provide an outlet for you.Rented it at Redbox, and even for a dollar, felt somewhat robbed. But we did have fun laughing at it."
1,Still processing this....,"Wow, this is really a bad movie. The costumes are too pressed, clean and bright to be realistic. The acting is REALLY BAD and overly dramatic in an unbelieveable way. I was not sure if it was a comedy or a spoof.. I'm still processing it, trying to figure out what the intent of the movie was. One scene was used for an early part then used again for a scene that takes place 8 years later. This ranks as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. But HEY!, we all like different things. Perhaps wait to see what others think of it."
1,Not a stitch of fun fur in sight...,"A sword-and-sorcery saga from the YouTube school of filmmaking. Sadly, even those who can appreciate fun-fur sagas like DEATHSTALKER won't get any cheap thrills here. Billy Zane makes an appearance; the kind that makes you think they had free meth on the set, along with a full access pass to screw the nubile cast members of your choice."
1,too old,This book came before MaxR2. why don't you buy other Max R2 or R2.5 books? it's waste of money!
2,Still Looking for a Solution,"Software is inadequate. You should be able to load any 1:1 graphic and it should a) arrived centered on the template and b) print centered on the label for that template. Software cannot deliver on this on a consistent basis. File navigation function for selecting label images is crude and incompetently programmed.If I wanted to rely on eyeballing and remembering to position images off center on screen to ensure a satisfactory printing, I would have stayed with what I had.If you can pick this up for $5 or less, it might be worth it because you get some labels, a nice label applicator, and alpha-test stage shareware quality software that may come in handy if you're lucky. Otherwise, keep looking."
5,This is the one to buy,"After trying many demo versions of different CD/DVD labeling software, this is the one I like the best by far. It has a flexible, highly intuitive and quirk-free user interface. Plus, it supports 24 different brands of labels which allows you to use whatever brand happens to be on sale at any given time."
1,You get what you pay for.,"I'm afraid this product is an example of what happens when you don't spend very much money on an important tool. It doesn't seem to be built well, which causes it to leak air and oil very easily. Even with thread seal tape, I had no success. I would suggest anyone looking for a quality tool for automaticly oiling their air tools, spend a few extra dollars, and buy a brand like Stanley or craftsman, and you should find a better item which gives much better results."
5,"Have not read it, waiting for paperback",Please let me know when this book is going to go into paperback....... thank you.
1,Did not work at all.,We used this for a clog in our toilet and it did not make any difference. It had no effect. It did not do anything at all!
3,An insight into how Warrior Houses work,"I've always thought Sun-Tzu Liao was over-demonized in the Stackpole trilogy. He is after all, burdened with an asylum for a creche. I'm glad that in this novel, along with Highlander Gambit, and the one with Avanti's Angel, we get to see a portrait of a true survivor. For me Aris Sung was just too typical a Battletech hero, too dimensional. But the brief appearance of Sun-Tzu in the prologue was justification enough to buy the book"
2,Too much for the age level for which it's intended,"There are about 10 words in this book I could not define without pulling out the dictionary. Heck..a few I can't even pronounce!I'm all for introducing children to different cultures (such as the Eskimo culture depicted in this book) but this book is intended for babies and toddlers, who are barely getting the hang of their own culture. By the time my child can read this book on her own, she won't ask, ""Mama, do you love me?"" She'll ask, ""Mama, What's a ptmargin egg and a mukluk?"""
3,It was okay,There had been some writing on the last 2 pages that were whited out. It was also underlined in a few spots which I didn't like.
4,Well worth the money,"When I ordered this video, I didn't know quite what to expect. After doing the workout several times, it seemed as though the muscle groups I'd historically had problems with were actually being targetted. However, I decided to wait to write a review until after I'd gone skiing the first time this year. After 3 days on the slopes, I can honestly say that the workout and training tips provided in this video have made a significant improvement in my skiing. By using the concepts and workout on this video, I had vastly improved my muscular endurance, and thus my enjoyment of the sport. I would highly recommend this tape for anyone who is relatively new to skiing. While the dialog is a bit ""cheezy"" at times, the exercises and training tips are worth living through the soundtrack for."
2,Skiing: Your Complete Trainig Resourse,"Don't buy this book. It ""sucks""Just work on your conditioning with any type of aerobics of your choice. Do lounges to strengthen your legs. This video won't help you be a better skiier."
5,Super Funny and Clean comedy at an excellent price,For the price I paid and the number of moives I got in this was excellent. The old stuff is funny as all outdoors but clean. Best buy I have made yet.
4,About time,"These are some of the funniest films ever made. The latter ones are not all that good, but still have their moments. ""Lydia the Tattooed Lady"" ranks right up there with ""Hooray for Captain Spaulding"".As for all the people complaining about the early films not being on DVD, they are. They were some of the first DVDs I bought about 4 years ago. They're even here on Amazon."
4,"Finally, my prayers are answered!","Finally, MGM gets around to a proper release of all their MGM films. This is a must for any fan of comedy. However, these movies are pretty uneven in quality.In my opinion, none of these films are as good as the out of print Paramount ones. But, all are worthwhile on their own. A Night At The Opera is the best of the lot, with close seconds being Go West, and A Day At The Races.I have to disagree with some reviews, though. The Big Store has its moments but isn't great. A Night in Casablanca is watchable but very forgettable and At The Circus and Room Service are incredibly bad. The only saving grace from at The Circus is the song ""Lydia The Tatooed Lady"". Outside of that, it's a waste. Room Service is a complete abject failure.But don't let that hold you back from this purchase. There is NO comedy team greater or more brilliant, and this set is the proof. When Paramount releases the other films, buy that as well. That's a 6 out of five star set, there!"
2,Poor packaging,"The package contained one disk that was either mislabeled (a non-Marx Bros. video) although the movie as the appropriate movie. Others were not labeled at all. Otherwise, ok."
5,For me useless,Rips the paper making removal more difficult. I might be me but I'll never use it again
5,Indelible Grace does it again...,"An excellent CD. Dan Haseltine of Jars of Clay sings the title song, ""For All The Saints,"" which has a new melody. ""Jesus I Come"" is sung by the talented Matthew Perryman Jones, and the whole CD is full of awesome hymn-texts set to music that is somewhat akin at times to the music on the ""Glory Revealed"" CD that came out from Mac Powell and an array of others about a year and a half ago. An excellent worship CD...highly recommended!"
5,Best of Roy Rogers,I am delighted with this CD. The songs of the 70's are sung so well as only Roy Rogers with his mellow voice can do. I listen to it frequently and share it with all my friends. I of course am a Roy Rogers fan and enjoy all his music as well as his old movies. Modern music can't compare to older tunes of this type which are so true in tune and words.
3,Coyote Ugly...,"Dr. Cameron (George Zucco) is a scientist experimenting on his handyman, Petro (Glenn ""don't call me Lon"" Strange), by injecting him with a serum that turns him into a ravenous werewolf by night! Cameron's been using wolf's blood (which is funny since the animal in the laboratory cage is clearly a coyote) to make his serum. Petro thinks he's been doing some harmless sleepwalking, when all along he's been on a murderous rampage! You see, he's Dr. Cameron's test subject, to both convince and slaughter the other scientists who mocked his revolutionary idea of creating an army of werewolves (!) to help in the war effort. Strange does his best to keep his dignity intact under the poofy wig and dime-store make-up he's forced to wear. MAD MONSTER is certainly not a classic wolfman movie, but it's worth a look or two..."
1,Don't Buy This DVD - There Is A Glitch!,"Please don't buy this DVD as at 8:32 into the movie the disc freezes. The only way to get past it is to skip to the next chapter and rewind to that point. Fast-forward will do no good, as it's doesn't work. I had two copies sent and they were both the same.By the way: The quality of the print is just awful.To be clear I want to explain that I'm talking about the more expensive Ventura Distribution edition. I doubt the less expensive disc freezes, but would bet the quality is even worse (if that's possible).If you buy it after reading this warning, remember I tried to say you some annoyance and you just didn't listen."
5,"Ignore Imgeorg's ""Review"" & Rating","Imgeorg's ""review"" should be deleted. It's not Amazon.com's fault that Imgeorg didn't read the product description. This product is one of Newmarket Press's wonderful series of Pictorial Moviebooks all of which provide beautifully illustrated background to the film in question & most of which (like this one) also provide a complete shooting script. All of these books enhance the viewing experience (in theaters &/or on DVD) but are certainly not intended to replace it."
5,Boy the Bear and the Bard,Great book! This book allows my son to be creative with making up a story for the pictures. He is only 3 but loves Shakespeare!
1,Blah,"This book was so disappointing I had to share my thoughts. I might accept the poor level of writing if I was getting the suspense of a mystery or the sexual tension of a romance, but in the tone of a more serious historical novel the result is just blah. I didn't feel for the characters. I didn't feel anything when Iphigenia or Paris died! I was interested in the story, but I should have stuck with Wikipedia or the Cliff Notes on the Iliad and the Aenead."
2,"So much potential, so little return","This book could have been so much better!!!! I liked it, but it could have been so much better."
2,Not Goodman's Best,"I have to disagree with the above reviewer. When Jo Goodman is at her best (Tempting Torment, Violet Fire, Forever in My Heart, Only in My Arms, to give several examples), her books are wonderful--heartwarming, fun, touching, and very human, Midnight Princess, however is not one of her best. The plot is disjointed, making strange twists and turns out of the blue. Unlike the relationships in Goodman's best, the relationship here between Jenny and Christian seems baseless and unbelievable. He starts out treating her with cruely and suddenly they are in love with no journey or growth the explain why he changes his mind or why she loves or even tolerates someone who has treated her so badly. This book does intruduce the Marshall family who return in later and,in my opinion, better novels including the Dennehy Sisters series."
3,This is NOT a holo sight,Not bad for a cheapie to hang on a .22 or some such.It's NOT a holographic sight though... it's a REFLEX sight.
4,Perfect for puppies,"This brush is tiny, but it is perfect for my corgi puppy. Makes it easy to get all the spots. My only issue is it seems to snag often, even in my puppy's short hair, and the wiry teeth were bent when it arrive (I just bent them back)."
5,AWESOME little slicker brush,"If you have a dog that is a little baby about being brushed, this is the slicker for you!! It has little rubber covers on those hard metal prongs that make it a more comfortable for the pup. It's good to start a puppy out on this and leading up to the more heavy duty slickers. I have slickers that cost $35 and I find myself using this one over and over!! I have like 8 all over the place so I can brush my Cavalier's ears."
3,"Good general overview, but I was looking for more.","This is a great book for someone who has no background or information at all about what therapy dogs do. I was looking for more instructional rather than informational.It provides a very comprehensive overview of therapy dogs tasks, how to your foot in the door of the therapy community and what to expect when u are there."
3,Great book,"This is a good book to read about the cultural revolution although some of the facts are fake and tried to grab the Westerner attention. Many things are exaggerated, and this author just trying to use this book to make money."
2,One man's story in a time wherein millions suffered horribly,"Liang Heng and Judith Shapiro have made a significant contribution to the study of contemporary China. The story of Liang Heng is truly a unique one; however, Shapiro and Heng fall far short of accomplishing what they could have. The reader is exposed somewhat to the fear, anguish, and vicious spite of the Cultural Revolution. Yet, they never bring one to a state of outrage or shock like Jung Chang does in her riveting story, Wild Swans. This book was definetly worthy of my time; however, I suspect many other readers will be displeased."
2,Was Mostly Disappointed,"Well, I'm going to drag down the average review. I have a couple of Gal Costa's other CDs--the 'Personalidade' series and Domingo with Caetano Veloso, as well as a couple of random others with Maria Bethnia, and I find this one not as good as the others. The first song, Baby, is not one of my favorites, and I find this version over-orchestrated. I prefer the one on the 'Personalidade' series--this one is just a little too languid for my taste. The Corao vagabundo is good, but the one I have on 'Domingo' with Caetano Veloso is fresher (of course, they were a lot younger then). London is just not one of my favorite songs, period, and I found the 49 second intro dull, especially compared to the 'Personalidade' versionI--the slower tempo kills any charm I may have thought it had. Finally, in Barato total and Teco teco, I feel like the event woke up a bit. Sua estupidez was the first slow song that I thought had any intensity at all. I just didn't understand Voc no entende nada."
5,Jerry Butler's Greatest Hits,Very clear sound. took me back to the 60s. I met my husband back in the day. groovy. Buy this CD today. The Ice Man Cometh!!
5,Top Shelf,"Special thanks to Books for the Bay Area for my mint copy of this book at a bargain price. A book I'd wanted for quite some time knowing full well how much I would enjoy it and David Plaut did not disappoint. As a twelve year old Dodger fan in 1962, whose heart was broken at the outcome of the race, after one hundred and sixty five regular season games, Plaut gives a masterful account of a magical year and time. I sit here now fifty years to the day of the Dodgers winning game two of the best of three playoff set, and am feeling very appreciative of having grown up during the times that I did."
4,UNA CANTANTE DE CALIDAD,"NUNCA HABÍA ESCUCHADO A ESTA CANTANTE. ME PARECE MUY BUENA Y CONSIDERO QUE MERECE UN MEJOR RECONOCIMIENTO. TIENE UNA VOZ MUY BIEN ENTONADA Y CON UN TIMBRE MUY AGARADABLE, OJALÁ Y EDITEN MAS CD'S DE ELLA."
3,western romances Collection,this was way too melodramatic and over the top for me... and also a bit farfetched... the heroine seems a bit too good to be true considering her upbringing and family situation... the doctor 's actions are improbable as well... if you are desparate ..it's a good read.. but.. otherwise.. you might want to try something else...there was a lot of potential here but don't think the author achieved it..
3,Good but simple,"The good side is that Olson has written an enjoyable book about a rather stiff subject. He really attempts to write the STORY of Christian Theology, in a narrating way. E g he puts effort into describing what actually happened at the Council of Nicaea, about how the Arians made a mistake and the bishops rioting etc. All that makes it a nice read.The small ""bad"" side is that he does not go deep enough into describing the theoretical parts.BTW - three stars from me is a good grade. The book is well worth buying. And woe to you who misuse the five star tags so that they mean nothing!!!------------------------CORRECTION: A few hundred pages later I have reached the Reformation and Pietism etc, and I have to raise my grade to four stars. In the later part of the book he delves quite skillfully into the theological webs. Above all it is so exciting reading, I'm longing to continue."
5,WOW,"I just bought this product, it great small and compact, come with a case, and this unit has power. Don't be fooled by one 9V Battery. Highly recommend. If you think you could use this product then you will be happy.Buy it."
3,"Bought for a ""Rife"" Machine","While well-made, this product did not perform as expected with my Atelier Robin wave function generator. Probably due to lack of power. More voltage may be necessary.The adheasive is fairly strong and long-lasting. I've run some over-night sets and the electrodes were still firmly in place in the morning.This could be a valuable product for the right machine."
4,Works,"It seems Everyone One knows what a Tens machine Is except for Me but No One knows what a Rife machine Is, The original Rife machine In the 1920's worked In the AM radio frequency range and used a plasma bulb. These pads I bought to use with My home made Rife machine (using a frequency generator and a Audio power amplifier) because I could Not hold 2 electrodes on My back and this pads now make that possible. This pads are stronger and stick better than the electro pads I had before. Also the shipping was fairly fast."
3,Electrode pins come out after just a couple of applications,Other than that I like this product. I was a surprise to get a shock on finger when it touched the electrode I did not know was sticking out just a tiny little bit.
3,"Interesting book but I prefer CD, watching episode","I've seen the episode several times and I have the CD (parts of that are actually pretty good)so I decided to get the accompanying book to go along with it.You'll get introductory material by Joss Whedon, a preface setting up the background for the episode followed by a copy of the script itself which other reviewers say is somewhat different to the broadcast version.After that you'll find sections covering music details and backgrounding for various show segments. This is followed by a short color section of photos, most from the episode itself.The last section of the book is I guess a complete selection of the sheet music, not of much interest to me.I did find the book interesting but I much prefer watching ""Once more with Feeling"", or listening to it, than reading about it."
3,GUIDE TO THE BAYOU CITY,"For whatever reason this guide is not nearly as thorough as the Marmac guide to Dallas. Houston, though larger, seems to get the short shrift. Having said that the guide is well put together and most of the reviews hit their mark, but it does not have all the great gossip and trivia the Dallas guide has and frankly Houston has just as much dish. Houston is a great town, with lots to do and deserved a better tour, but if you need some history and a solid travel guide to H Town, then I do recommend this book, but Big D gets the better workup."
2,BEHOLD: A Pale of Horse Shet,"Sorry, never watched the movie. If it has ANYTHING to do wit that book, it's an abomination. Psy-warfare that takes fact and mixes with fiction so the 'tattler' (con-spiracy nut) sounds like a nut."
2,Memories of Danny Kaye,"I eagerly awaited the arrival of this DVD having played the tape of Hans Christian Anderson many times to my children when they were growing up, the theme tune went around & around in my head for days. I couldn't wait to play it when it arrived but to my disapointment the theme tune had been changed to something else,while it is still nice to see Danny Kaye I'm afraid to me it was just not what I wanted to hear."
1,Cheap looking,"The picture of this case makes it look better than it is. I was disappointed when I got it, it looks like cheap plastic."
2,The Look How Great I Am Book,"This book spends too much time telling you how great Tom Monahan is. Too much time telling you how to read the book. Too many tired ""catchy"" names for his brainstorming processes. And to make matters worse, too many fonts & font sizes to look at. And this from someone who sat through one of his seminars & loved it.Stick to other books like ""How To Get Ideas"" or ""Hey Whipple, Squeeze This"" for real creative inspiration."
5,A great read on an extraordinary topic,"This is a wonderful book that deals with a rather fascinating subject: quantum mecahnics. For those who may not be familiar w/QM, it is the physics of the microcosmic world of electrons, photons, protons & neutrons. It is where Newtonian causality breaks down, where there appears a ""totally new ballgame."" Gribbin does an excellent job of writing for the layman, especially considering the recondite nature of the topic. However, I would recommend anyone interested in QM to read Alice In Quantumland by Robert Gilmore first as it is slightly more accessible & also has the advantage of being ""fun"" to read (it is told as an allegorized story). Note that I still recommend Gribbin's book, but AFTER one has read Gilmore's. It may help to make Gribbin's book make a bit more sense. All in all, though, this is an enlightening work."
1,Terrible paper,"The quality of the paper just made imposible to finish the book.I think books will be around for ever, even with Kindle, PDF's, ebooks, etc. I love to make notes, arrows, use post-it's, underline... I'm a book fan, I like the feeling of a good quality book in my hands.This book, for the person who enjoys the ""paper experience"", is hell. I couldn't even finish it.Have you left a book inside a car for days, during very sunny days?That's the feeling I get when trying to go through the pages.I've even decided I'm going to finish it. Ripping out every page and reading it separately.About the information inside the book:Have you seen a good movie with a neighbor's music incredibly high, your kids jumping around, the phone ringing, and a headache?The movie may be good, as this book may be good. But under those conditions (the paper quality or the situation presented before) there is no way you can enjoy it."
4,this is good,"If you were old enough to appreciate music on the radio in the 50s you might agree. For me listening to this CD evokes memories of that decade and I am surprised that I remember the words to the more familiar songs: Side by Side, Wheel of Fortune and If You Love Me (Really Love Me)Kay Starr has a distinctive voice, very strong and earthy."
5,Wow I Iove Dragon Ball Z!!!,Dragon Ball Z is so awesome i have all 5 boxes and i just cant wait untill they released this and the 7th one so i will complete the Dragon Ball Z Sagas
4,Narrowly made it to four stars.,"It was a close call as to whether to rate this book 3 stars or 4; it wasn't particularly exceptional, although it was competent and entertaining. Ultimately, the fact that it was entertaining was enough to push it to four stars, but only just; there was nothing particularly extraordinary here, but it was a perfectly adequate Star Trek story, well told and well-written."
4,goos show but why is it $100?,"This is a good show, good mix of action with a bit of thought mixed in. But why is it listing for over $100? just picked it up at movie stop for $20."
4,Really good/ Really long,"This anime series is top notch! It has mystery, terror, and sex appeal. Sort'a! It is visually stunning and worth the wait. But the wait is my only complaint. Like so many anime series, it went on to long! I would have cut out 6-8 episodes and condensed most of that material into the rest of the series. And I would've had a few more fight scenes to spice things up a bit. Other than that it's a suprisingly good series. I highly recommend it for people looking for compelling story telling!"
5,THE GREATEST: JACKIE WILSON,"Tony Douglas' book, ""Jackie Wilson:The Man, The Music, The Mob,"" far surpasses Mr. Douglas' talents. Mr. Douglas' book, ""Jackie Wilson: Lonely Teardrops,"" was fantastic and now Mr. Douglas comes back with an even greater book. For the people who never knew Jackie they can now educate themselves on this exceptional man and find out why Jackie was, ""Mr. Excitement."" Mr. Douglas did years of research and has covered a lot of ground work. He has talked to the people that knew Jackie and loved him. This is an exceptional book taken from the heart of one man.Mr. Douglas went a step further he spoke with one of the bravest woman of Jackie's life, Freda Wilson, Jackie's wife of 13 years. She sacrificed it all for Jackie to be a star. Jackie was the greatest R & B artist that ever lived and if he had survived he would have blown everyone away with his astonishing talent and charisma. He was the one and only, ""Mr. Excitement."""
2,Disapointed,It was advertised buy 3 get one free. I ordered and only got the 3 bottles. I am not ever going to use your service again!
4,Insider's Guide to Grad. Programs in Clinical & Counseling Psych.,"This book made the applying to grad school process far less painful. It allowed me to compare different programs so that I could narrow my choices down substantially. It was also an easy read, so it wasn't exhausting reading it."
2,what a let down!,"Fforde gives the reader funny supporting characters and a great hero in this book, but the heroine has to be on of the most exasperating characters ever written! Most of her actions make no sense, and her reasoning (when she bothers to give a reason) is often weak and rather stupid. LIFE SKILLS does have many redeeming qualities, such as Fforde's descriptions of longboating, but the heroine is very, very silly. If you want a good Fforde book, read STATELY PURSUITS, which is absolutely lovely!"
3,"well, now I know about canal boats!","Julie Fairfax needs a job. After answering an ad she is offered a job on a pair on canal boats as a cook and general helper. Through her experience we learn an awful lot about boats and just how narrow they are!Fergus, an old friend of the family who Julie does not appreciate, helps them out when they are in need of extra crew. Julie doesn't like this Fergus at all, with horrible memories of their intertwined childhood. Still he perseveres with attempting to court Julie, despite their arguments and differing views. However, it would seem that opposites do attract as we follow their lives down the canals and into happy ever after."
2,Not worth the time,"I'll disagree with J. Fuzz. I say this is a badly acted B-rated movie. It is something I would have expected to see on T.V. 20 years ago. Don't waste your time with this one. The special effects are ok, but that is it. The sad part is that this could have been such a good movie had it been done correctly. By the way, hate to ruin anything, but the aliens look human of course. It could have been pulled off with better acting."
1,Pay others to watch it!!,"This was worst made film made by filmmakers who had the benefit of seeing other films and reading Sci-Fi material. If this film had been made 40 years ago, it would be worthy of praise. In the light of what we know about making Sci-fi movies and actors and filmmakers and people with money and time who have been to the movies , it was a waste of time making it and of those who watched it. This is not good Sci-fi. Everything was bad, the way people talked , died ,ran, hurryed along, drove, acted. The screenwriter was deaf and blind to how people talk and act. The special effects and CGI showed they had time and money."
1,Oh dear,All I have to say is that I was dragged into a movie theater by the people who worked in the theater and I was told that this movie was another Star Wars. This movie is so fantastically bad that I have to have just to relive the hysterics and laugh so hard ths my sides will split. It's really bad. You'd be better off watching Lost in Space...the original tv version!
1,Tenemos que mejorar mucho,"Amigos, me apena mucho decirles que no me siento nada feliz con este DVD. Pense que mis compatriotas harian un esfuerzo para proporcionar una buena calidad del sonido (todo lo contrario). Los metales son demasiado fuertes y los bajos parecen estar ausentes. Compre este DVD porque queria tener en mi coleccion un buen exponente del merengue, como lo es Eddy Herrera, pero no esperaba tan mala demostración de sonido. En buen Dominicano ""Suena como un laterio"". Por lo menos tiene muy buena calidad de imagen, pero eso no es suficiente.Espero que mis comentarios ayuden a mejorar tanto a Eddy como a otros buenos cantantes Dominicanos en producciones posterios a esta."
2,The Wright Nasr Ahmadinejad segment,"Robin Wright speaks as if she is an apologist for Ahmadinejad. She shows no moral outrage whatsoever at the absolutely evil ambitions of Ahmadinejad. She speaks about him as a 'rhetorician' because he does not answer questions directly. She does not talk about his factual innaccuracy, his substitution of 'mythic material' for historical fact. She says nothing about his Messianic aims. She totally misinterprets his thrust for 'nuclear power' as involving civilian purposes primarily. She shows no awareness of the strategic uses of nuclear weapons for Iran.Charlie Rose should have been tougher with her here and also with Vali Nasr. Wright and Nasr are supposed experts about the situation in Iran. Why didn't they speak about the kind of vision of the future given by Ahmadinejad's religious teachings?This was something very rare for Charlie Rose- a shameful show."
3,It happened to Jane,"I ordered this to show at a 50's movie night-for current teens. I hoped it would be Doris Day fun and clean. We didn't show it because,though clean, 'twas a bit corney, and the plot very slow. It had a happy ending and right prevailed, but Audrey Hepburn in ""Roman Holiday"" was a better choice. LAS"
2,Classic actors and that's about it,"Ernie Kovacs is great as the bad guy, Jack Lemmon is good as the Caspar Milquetoast who finds his voice, and Doris Day is, well, Doris Day. Aside from that, the story's a bit weak, the kids are terminally cute and nobody has to explain how Doris Day is going to get a couple thousand lobsters out of two little dockside pens."
3,Doris Day,"This is the classic Doris Day film. If you love her other movies like Don't Pick the Daisies or Pillow Talk, then you will love this one also."
2,Not what it could have been,"This is an excellent tutorial in some respects. The instructions are step-by-step, and it is packed with illustrations. However, there is little attempt to address the theme behind the art, to establish the ""rules of the form"" as, say, Aidan Meehan's books have done for Celtic Art. Bill Holm's classic ""Northwest Coast Indian Art: An Analysis of Form"" remains the best bet in this field if you are interested in creating original designs in this style. If however, you just want to copy preformed designs and get a feel for the modern trends in this style, this is a good introductory choice. And I do mean modern trends. The other glaring insufficiency in this book is its lack of a classic feel. Many of the designs are not strictly traditional, and though some see this as a sign of vitality, I see it as a blemish on a grand tradition."
1,BEWARE BOSCH!,"Bosch customer service is an nonexistent. The ONLY authorized service center in the US is in NY. As to my experience, I own the immediate predecessor to this model. After a few months use, when pulling out (without any excessive force) the self-retracting power cord, the whole cord detached from the vacuum. According to Bosch, this is a problem they do not cover under warranty. Estimates for repair from several shops were well over $100.00."
4,Enjoyable,"I depend upon this author to give me novels that a middle-aged female can relate to and she brings it home again with this story of how the definitions of family and marriage evolve through the years. I also enjoyed her book, The Rector's Wife."
2,A major let-down,"Mercedes Lackey is obviously a big name in the world of fantasy writing. As a result, I decided to borrow this book from the library and give it a go. I was very much disappointed. The plot was somewhat engaging, but I found many of the characters to be flat and one-dimensional. I was very unsympathetic with Lavan because of his irksome and seemingly uncalled for gloomy outlook. I wouldn't buy this book, but if you're looking for a somewhat entertaining read that you don't have to put much thought or emotion into, this is it."
3,Trite,"While I felt this was a well-written books (as most of the Lackey books I've read) it was so similar to the Magic's Pawn series that it made difficult to read sometimes. Brightly Burning should have been a book that was good enough to stand on its own, its very disheartening to have it lean so heavily on Vanyel's books.What bothered me the most was that from beginning even to the very end was unoriginal and already-done in her previous books.Don't even get me started on that life-bond. HehBut, if you enjoy good writing, pick up the book anyway. While I didn't feel it was excellent quality, it is definitely worth the six bucks."
2,Hardly an Oktoberfest Favorite,"The CD is a cheap make with a lousy orchestra, not at all symbolic of a Beer tent ""Kapelle""Knowing Oktoberfest in person, I can say, except for a few songs, none of them are played in a beer hall at the Oktoberfest in Munich.There is at least one or more new ""Wies'n Hits"" every year and none are on this CD.Don't waste your money buying this crap. It goes into the trash immediately."
1,Hours of sitting in front of your PC doing nothing,"While the graphics, options, and sound in this game are all good, it mimics the real hunt to closely. Hours of sitting still and quiet out in nature looking for a real deer is a heck of a lot different than hours of sitting still and quiet in your cozy computer chair staring at the screen in search of a deer. It's boring."
5,Absolutely amazing,"I just recently got this album, and it's amazing. These guys most definately know how to play guitar, drum, sing. Of course the best part about this album is the minimal screaming Claudio used. Oh Yeah, BTW check out ""LilBrit""'s past reviews.... haha she gave Avril Lavigne a 5...while calling her a punk... haha if that doesn't say something about her musical tastes,I don't know what does."
2,Waste of money,"I purchased this cd based on all the positive reviews I had heard of it. I had never actually heard the band. Unfortunately, this seems to have been a bad idea. This cd is really quite unimpressive. The singer's voice is terrible. He does sing some interesting melodies but they end up sounding like crap because of his voice; like some anonymous alt-rock band. The music is slightly more complex than a lot of stuff out there, but so is ELP and I don't buy their cd's. If you want interesting music that is worth listening to then buy The Mars Volta's Deloused in the Comatorium or Tool's Aenema."
5,ahead of their time...,"in all aspects of music (from song structure, to variety of styles of the songs, to vocals, and the artists' talents) this record in flawless. the same could be definitely said about ""THE SECOND STAGE TURBINE BLADE"". I'm an avid fan of all music, ranging from underground hip-hop to heavy metal to classical to country to trance & techno. We're talkin' about no descrimination between genres. I can honestly say that after listening to this record, this ranks in my personal TOP 10 of the best recordings ever to be put out in the history of mankind. And Claudio Sanchez is third in the TOP 3 of best vocalist of all time. (first is Cedric Bixler of MARS VOLTA and second is Freddie Mercury of QUEEN). COHEED & CAMBRIA are about 20 years ahead of their time and the world is struggling to catch up..."
5,Diverse,"A great CD. Coheed never seems to stick to one particular style, (a good thing). The vocals have an amazing range and no one song sounds similar to the other. First song reccomendations would be#2, #4, #7, #8.(not very good at remembering names, sorry.) This band has no limits and could end up anywhere they want. Also try Glassjaw or Thrice."
2,all down hill,i bought the old CD as soon as it came out and loved i to death i listened to it e very day and i was first in line for the new on as i listened to it ther was no comparison to the first album idk what happned but this cd is way overrateed becase the first cd was soo good
4,"Sell-outs? Kinda, but not really......","Not that I'm the kind of person that is bent on virtually destroying every ""sell-out"" band out there, it's just that I can't decide if I want to call CO&CA; sell-outs. Seriously, if you listen to what Claudio is singing half the time it's about death and/or other things you may not expect of this kind of sound...... but then again I'm not one to judge. It's different than what you'd normally catch me listining to but that dosen't make them bad. Actually, they truthfully have some awsome guitar solos not normally found in pop-punkish bands. Check it out if yer into this kinda music. Doubt you'd ever see it on Mtv (not that I'd know seeing how Mtv has gone to being nothing but that rap garbage). WARNING may take some getting used to.PS: I would rather jump face first into sharpened razor blades than watch one second of that Mtv garbage."
1,Um...,"This stuff is pretty boring and they sound kind of like they were made to make a lot money off of kid's at the Warped Tour who like to call these bands ""emo"". It sounds kind of like some fans of Winger and Taking Back Sunday doing a jam session."
4,this is where the rock is,"Rock is in a sad state, and this band is new hope in a failing genre. These guys are some of the best musicians out there. The band is tight. Claudio Sanchez, the lead singer, delivers some of the best lyrics in the hard rock world with one of the most distinctive voices you'll ever hear. They can be compared to Tool or Radiohead in depth and creativity. In short, they give me chills. This album, and the previous album, are both concept driven epics, and the band plans to release comic books in 2004 to flesh out the story."
1,yesterdays garbage,"this band is awful, they suck big time, and aparently they dont know what good musicianship is.. Seeing this song on the same countdown as breaking benjamins sooner or later makes me sick as hell.. I dont recomend anyone buying this album , it is distastefull, disgusting, ignorent, and very annoying.. Save your money and buy a real rock bands album."
1,Yikes it sucks!,"bad songs, bad album... Though I do own all 4 of there albums, this is garbage. The band seemed to go in a different direction of sound compared to albums 1,2 & 4.Get there 2nd album ""The Second Stage Turbine Blade""& there 1st album ""The Penelope EP"" if you can find it!!!The 4th album ""Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star, Volume One: From Fear Through The Eyes of Madness"" is amazing too!!!"
1,A huge waste of money !!!,"(...)The only 2 things I like about this CD is the first 1 min. and 7 sec. of track #2 (In keeping secrets of silent earth: 3),(I recommend cranking it up as loud as you can get it!)A definite 10/10...atleast the first 1:07. And the other thing I like is ""A favor house atlantic"" (Track #10), I give it a 6.8/10. But, over all I would have to say this CD sucks bigtime butt.One more thing, as a Christian, I was appalled at the lyrics in ""Three Evils (Embodied in Love and Shadow)"" (Track #4). They were VERY offensive. I stopped listening to this CD mostly because of this song. (...)"
5,Again to the nay-sayers,"Another Brilliant effort of Coheed. These guys have a legitimacy that astounds me. The lyrics and content are like a neoclassical throw back to Greek Mythology, and Biblical stories. To you folks offended by some of the content, widen your mind, it's art. It's not all literal. I'm really amazed by the sophistication of these guys; they have intellegence and great sense of creativity. Outstanding tracks: In Keeping Secrects, The Crowing, and Favor House."
1,Dissapointed,"I would have to say that i am a MAJOR fan of ""Second Stage Turbine Blade"". I have searched for Shabutie albums since listening to C&C's debut album because i enjoy their sound so much. When word of the second album hit i was the first to find the release date and when the album came in i bought it, ripped of the plastic and shoved it into my cd player. As i drove home i became, slowly, depressed. The album is weak. Some of the tracks shouldnt pass as songs but loose jam sessions, and the only songs i give any new credit to is ""Three Evils"" and the title track. The rest of the album seems filler, and ""Blood Red Summer"" is the popiest track i have ever heard. I am still a major C&C fan....but i feel as if ive been let down."
3,Guidelines and ideas for new history teachers,"I saw the 1 star rating for this book and felt the need to add my own review. I used this book (although minimally) for a class as a soon to be history teacher. If you are new to teaching history it does offer some guidelines and ideas that seem reasonable. Yes, it has a common sense approach, and can leave you with a ""duh"" feeling, but I did not find it belittling perhaps since I am looking at it from a beginner's perspective. I liked that the ideas and models of lesson plans were relatively short (one or two pages) and understandable. Are there better books out there? Probably, but it was worth a look to me."
4,A great find!,"I was blown away by this debut CD by CAESAR, a band from Athens, GA. Unpredicable songs and intense lyrics! Athens is a town known for jangly alt-pop music but this is something altogether different. These songs start with loops and samples that build a strange and beautiful mood under haunting lyrics of a world out of control. Wow! If you would like to hear a truly unique fusion of quality songwriting and layered found-sound, give CAESAR a shot."
4,Very quick service,"We ordered this on Tuesday night and it arrived on Friday. Great, fast service from this seller!"
2,Intro to comp bio,"This text was really difficult to read; too many symbols, not enough examples. I didn't find it useful at all."
1,It's an infommercial,"I have read many books and watched more documentaries on this topic than I can count. By far, this film (if u wanna call it that) is nothing more than a commercial to get the viewer interested in buying dvd's from reality media (or is it reality entertainment??). I have NEVER posted a comment online about anything....until now! My aim is to warn people this film is horrible!"
1,Sorry Movie,"If I could have rated it a NO Star I would have. Terrible script, sorry volume control, no information that isnt avail. online. Would LOVE to have my money back so I could rent something worthwhile.Dont waste your money.Go to Netflix and see more, better, NOW and free."
4,Z cover,"I don't want to do the other reviewer a disservice but if he actually owns the X5 then the reason this cover is loose is because it's made for the fractionally bigger X5L (which has a longer battery life). That's the model I have and the skin fits perfectly. The hard screen protector is a great feature and I think the black finish looks far better than translucent skins. The only negatives I have are that it's overpriced and that an issue I have with the headphone jack, which for some reason seems to 'grip' the headphones slightly looser than on other players I've had, is worsened by having a closely fit layer of rubber all around the input."
3,I Expected a Tight Fit,"I currently own the iAudio X5 and had been looking for a cover for it or a arm band for it for quite some time. When I came across this item I was excited to see that there was something that would not only look good but protect my device. I ordered and was dissappointed to find out that such a beautiful cover did not fit as tightly or snug as I expected it to. I do recommend this product for protective purposes, if you can I would wait to see if Zcover would plan to make one that fits a bet more to specs of the actual X5. My sister owns a Ipod and her cover made by the same company fits great, and it looks good, that is how I expected my to fit. Keep working on it zCover."
4,Nb: These come with cleats!,"Just got my order and was pleasantly surprised to find a pair of SM-SH11 cleats in the package. Now I have a backup, LOL."
4,Good Pedals,"No frills, solid road pedals. It would be nice if they stayed in the upright position, but hey thats why you pay the big bucks. These are a great value for only about 20 more than the cleats alone. Wish I had silver, silver shows less wear."
3,I wish I liked it more,"Disclaimer: This review is not intended for Tortoise fans, I couldn't tell you anything about this in the context of their output.I heard this album was done a bit tongue-in-cheek, a joke of sorts, Will and Tortoise having fun. I believe it. The two entities coming together and the resultant smashing together of disparate styles ain't easy to listen to. I am devoted Will Oldham fan and it is as a Bonnie Billy record that I am interested in this album. The presence of Tortoise pretty much trashes the Oldham aesthetic. And it's the Oldham aesthetic that I love, so there's not much for me here. The tracks I like the most are the two or three with little audible input from Tortoise. I don't mean to dis Tortoise or their fans (really, I don't); it's simply that they make a kind of music that doesn't move me. For me, this is a little novelty record to listen to every once in a while until the next Bonnie Prince Billy record comes out."
2,Somewhat good.,Wasn't what I was looking for. Might be good as a first book. that's all I have. you are making the review too hard.
3,Hit or Miss.,"I was recommendedNaturVet Bitter Yuck No Chew Sprayat a local Petco because they said some dogs actually enjoy Bitter Apple spray. When Bitter Yuck failed, I decided to go for something more substantial-- A Bitter Apple GEL-- by recommendation fromThe Everything Labrador Retriever Book: A Complete Guide to Raising, Training, and Caring for Your Lab (Everything Series)The product seems to momentarily curb my puppy's interest in an object immediately after application, but it doesn't take long before the puppy is back chewing on it again (a few hours). I think it's hit or miss. Either your dog won't care or it will hate it. It probably also depends on whether your dog will learn from the first attempt, or will keep going back until the gel just wears off.It'll probably work great for a quick learning dog with a sensitive palette, but seems to be ineffective for the rambunctious and curious puppy who learns the world through its mouth."
2,Not bitter enough,"I'm not sure if this product works at all. After applying this, my dog immediately started licking the spots where I put it."
2,Disappointing,"I read this because it won an Edgar; I love good science fiction but hate it when it's badly done, and I had some hopes for this. Unfortunately I was disappointed. The plot (invisible family fights to free other invisibles from a government conspiracy) had some potential. However the invisibility concept, so important to the story, wasn't well explained. In some chapters the invisible people could see each other more clearly than the visible world, but a chapter earlier or later they could only see themselves when wet and only ""saw"" each other through some poorly explained synaptic memory malfunction. I wasn't fond of the characters either, particularly the ridiculously stereotyped ""shaman."" Many of the problems could have been solved through better editing to catch the inconsistencies and irritating mistakes (like spelling archaeological site ""sight""). As it stands, however, there are too many problems for this book to be enjoyable to read. Despite the award, I'd skip this one."
3,Three semesters in one book is a bit too much,"I attend UNLV and when I took Calc I, II and III a few years ago, this is the book we used. Its coverage for 1st semester calc up to the beginning of integrals is decent. However, they needlessly complicate some of the more advanced integration techniques for 2nd semester calc. I found it difficult material to get through without falling asleep, and I love math.Its biggest weakness is in vector calculus. The coverage is sparse and lacking at times, and overly detailed in others. For instance, surface and volume integration were very important to me as an engineering student, but there just weren't enough examples and no ""weird"" geometries at all. Then, their coverage of planes, which for me is not all that important, was tremendously detailed.You probably don't have much of a choice if you're using this book for a course, but if you're planning on taking courses like electromagnetics, I'd recommend supplementing the vector calc portion with an E&M; book."
4,Great book...,This is a great book for people who already have a firm grasp on the understanding of mathematics. The problem sets show you various scenarios that allow you to use your newly found skills flexibly.
4,Good Clean Fun,"A psychic fair, a corn maze, a murder AND stain tips...another great read from Sharon Short! Josie's finally coming into her own, her friends are a hoot, and I can't wait to see what happens with Owen. Looking forward to Sharon's next book!"
3,One But Not The Other,"Funny Girl is Outstanding! Absolutely FIVE STARS! The music is incredible and Barbara is at her all time best. Barbara recaputures the brillance of her stage role and brings it to the screen. A throughly enjoyable film. And then there is Funny Lady. It can not be said that effort was not put into the making of this sequel, however, it pales by comparrison to the original. The peformances seem forced, the music and songs are just so-so and some of the dance numbers are down right laughable. A true disappointment. The only reason to purchase this two DVD set is to be able to really appreciate just how good the original is and how poor the follow up film is. My recommendation is to definately purchase Funny Girl and rent Funny Lady so you don't waste your money."
5,The combo pack DOES have the Streisand featurettes,"I had put off buying this combo pack because the reviews here said that you only get the featurettes if you purchase Funny Girl by itself. However, I finally broke down and bought the combo pack and the featurettes are on the Funny Girl disc!"
5,A Beautiful and Comprehensive Volume,"Erwitt's fine body of work is cleanly reproduced here and loosley arranged by subject matter. The work is allowed space to breathe and speak for itself, as there are very few textual interruptions. Erwitt's signature visual humour, evidence of the decisive moment, and the universality of humankind are all well represented. The full-size reproductions are rich with detail, sumptuous tones and precise grain. This is an excellent addition to any library of photography or coffee table, as well as an excellent introduction to the finest work of one of the world's great photographers."
5,Great Film - Great Soundtrack,"I got this soundtrack used from www.amazon.co.uk and it's really a smash! I wonder if it will ever be available here in the U.S. again, I'd love to give it to friends."
3,"Does work, but don't expect miracle...","Doesn't provoke irritation that some lubes and jelly toys do. Seems to relax striated muscle about 25%. Has a strong herbal odor, but not unpleasant to someone who hates most perfumes..."
1,Would not buy again,"When these ribbons arrived, I was not impressed. The ribbons had been put into two packages (each package contained a different number of ribbons - which I thought was a little odd). The gold lettering was poor and in some places it had come off all together. The ribbons had been cut unevenly (they were slanted and not a straight cut across), so I had to try to cut them straight across to make them even look presentable to give out as awards."
3,Gourd Hanger,Not a bad way to add more housing for the birds. Good only on triangular telescoping poles.
2,Jumps and Skips,"While the format of this DVD is excellent, the quality is inferior, at least on the one I received.It jumps and skips, then hangs up altogether. I was unable to get past the second song, as I kept having to restart it."
4,good item for the price,Really nice fire although as others have said can't see the top of the flame. Added a nice background to Christmas party. Music was alright but got tired of it quick as all the songs started to sound the same so just put on the crackling fire and added our own music. Everybody really liked the atmosphere it created.
2,Not the Original Recordings!!!,These are NOT the original recordings. They're not bad recordings.....just not the originals!!
3,This is It?,"Considering that Whisperin' Bill wrote ""I Missed Me"" (done by Jim Reeves also) and others and had ""Po Folks"" as a hit of sorts, I can't believe this is his ""best"" (translate that to ""all""). Many of the songs on this package are cover versions of other singers' hits and don't evoke memories of this soft-spoken man. Even Walter Brennan narrated a great ""Mama Sang A Song"". That leaves Bill with ""Still"", a 1962 hit, as his big moment (along with the TV game show, ""The Better Sex""). Hard to believe."
3,I couldn't put the book down!,"I like The Blizzard Disaster because of the character, Wonderful. I couldn't put the book down! It was so good! I recommend it.It is kind of a Mystery. Read it today!"
5,Bring this to the PSP in America!,"If you've ever played an isometric strategy game and had even a little bit of fun then you've got to pick this up. The NIS Triumvirate of Angels (LaPucelle) - Humans (Phantom Brave) - & Demons (Disgaea) is the most unique approach to this style of gaming out there. Not only is each game a stand alone hit, but they each have their own special features that make them stand out; NIS didn't take the easy way out by putting up a cookie cutter outline with just different characters. This is a must have for RPG and isometric strategy fans - no question.Give it to us on PSP! In Japan they've released LaPucelle - Ragnarok on the PSP and from what I understand it's a port of the PS2 version with enhanced features, much like Phantom Brave and Disgaea 1&2. We need this in a portable form! Listen to your fans NIS, we love your stuff and want to take it everywhere!"
1,This game isnt fun its also very hard,"You wouldnt want this game. It has a weird tactical battle style that is really weird. Its nothing like a real fighting game and its not real-time. First you are on like a board-game type screen and your team and the bad guys just stand there and do nothing. You click the character of yours you want to attack and you can move them a certain amount of spaces and you attack the monsters and this weird screen pops up and you have no clue whats going on.I would reccommend getting a real time fighting game, this game is so fake. not only that its very hard and long."
3,great show....,One of the most funny show from comedy central..however release more then a third of the show.....several of the best are left out of the releases so far....more of the first season could have been on this dvd.....bring this back too tv..I ..wish
4,Put them all on DVD!,"As a rabid MST3K fan, I ran right out and bought this DVD set. Of course the movies are great. You have to be a Mistie fan to want to see them in the first place. I assume only Mistie fans will be reading this review anyway. I have to say the Creeping Terror is my fave out of this group. Truly horrifying, in the worst way, but also hysterical. I guess my favorite MST3Ks are when they watch old sci-fi. Also there are no extras whatsoever on the DVDS. Clearly Rhino doesnt want to spend any more money than they have too since only fans would want to buy it and they would buy it regardless of any extra bonus material. I wish they would release more episodes."
1,not worth it at any price,"This is a very shoddy piece of merchandise. Beside the fact that the wooden platter has a finish that wouldn't hold up for 2 washings, the very thin cast iron tray does not fit into the hole securely. I can see the whole thing slipping off and hitting the floor on the way back to the serving table. It is so difficult to determine quality from a small picture on the web and this item was the perfect example. It looked reasonably substantial in the photo, but when it arrived It looked like it should be offered for sale at the dollar store."
5,The Prize by Julie Garwood,For the past 20 years I have loved all of Julie Garwood books. They are so well done & fun to read.
1,No attraction,"As I read this book I thought is this really Julie Garwood? The whole book has the feel that she was just in a hurry to crank out something to meet a production deadline. The character development is thoroughly lacking and the bedroom bits are way over the top in comparison to her other novels. I always enjoyed her books because the bedroom romance was tame, but this one goes overboard and I end up skipping over them because there are just too many of them and they are a bit graphic for my taste. I find no chemistry between the main characters and in fact see it as more of an abusive relationship where they are just constantly angry at each other except when they are doing the deed. I don't find that romantic at all."
2,Not Best,"I like many others here am usually an avid Garwood fan but also like others for some reason this didn't sit well with me. I agree with other reviews that the H is horrible in this one. To me the writing was Garwood but the story itself seemed lacking I liked the h but she was supposed to be this strong character able to defend herself but when it came to him her backbone seemed to drop in a vacinity far south. All in all it was an ok story just never warmed up to the H, definately not her best and unless you have to read everything by Garwood really I would avoid this one personally."
3,"Ok, not up to the author's usual standards","This book was steamy at times, but was not as romantic as the other Garwood books that I've read. Thus far it is my least favorite of her books."
4,Another wow for Julie.,"I thought this was a great book. Even though i am 15, does't matter! I have fallen in love with Historical Romances, and by far Julie Garwood is one of the best authors of romance novels. This book just added to my favorites :). I especially loved the ending!"
2,SAVE YOUR TIME!,"This book was boring. I mean, the character discriptions were poor and it was just plain LAME-O!"
5,Midnight Magic,"This book is wonderful, and full of many puzzlers. If you're a fan of magical and enchanting books, I know you'll love this book."
4,Midnight Magic,"A Magician and his servant try to crack a ghost case that could haunt the life of a royal family forever.In midnight Magic, Mungus, the magician, has been called apon to use his magic to solve a case that has been troubaling the royal family for a while. As a detectective the ghost problem isn't comming to well for mungus. He and his servent, Fabrizo think that they have detected the issue,but the real big problem is still at lage.I have enjoyed this book as a mystery or fantast. I hope you will have just as fun as I did, reading Midnight Magic.R.R"
5,A truly amazing book with with everything a great book needs,"This book is about a boy named Fabrizio who is an apprentice to a magician master named Mangus. He was given a pardon from the king which saved his life, he was charged with witch-craft which was illegal. So when the king's daughter is being taunted by a spirit he calls on good old Mangus thinking that he can just snap his fingers and rid the spirit of the princess for good but it's not that easy. Also to put even more pressure on Mangus, the King's adviser count Scarrzoni, whom everyone in the counrty knows has the real power at court, threatens Mangus that if he doesnt' rid princess of the ghost he will kill him and Fabrizio.but why would count scarrzoni go to so much trouble to protect the princess who hates him?"
2,The Magic at Midnight was Awesome,"The Magic at Midnight was AwesomeAdam WallerAvi's Midnight Magic was a pretty good book, but it went really slow. It was boring at sometimes because all they did was argue. The book is in the renaissance and is about a magician who is put to trial for witchcraft and wizardry. The book got the best when the magician is put to trial. The worst part in the book is when the king's servant comes to the door and the magician's servant gets into an argument with the king's servant. The book was pretty good but it had its bad moments. The reason I didn't love it was because it was way to slow moving."
4,Midnight Magic,"A Magician and his servant try to crack a ghost case that could haunt the life of a royal family forever.In midnight Magic, Mungus, the magician, has been called upon to use his magic to solve a case that has been troubling the royal family for a while. As a detectective the ghost problem isn't coming too well for Mungus. He and his servent, Fabrizo think that they have detected the issue,but the real big problem is still at large.I believe that Avi wrote this book to make a fun exciting story that would make you not want to put the book down. I also think that any reader of Harry Potter book would appreciate this story.I have enjoyed this book as a mystery/fantasy. I hope you will have just as fun as I did, reading Midnight Magic.R.R"
4,As advertised....,Very nice design...nice colour....as per advertised....although the strap is a bit loose and need to tighten a few times throughout
3,Hiker back-pack,"I was attracted to the bright color for safety and appeal, although the compartments turn out to be less durable and versatile in reference to a previous blue Sierra pack of the same type I used on my trip to India. Replacing it with the orange pack failed my expectations."
2,Not worth it,"The pack itself didnt look so bad but the straps were awful. They are definitely generic and screams cheap. Put the money towards a known, name brand pack. I ended up buying a Deuter that conforms to my body and love it. Dont go cheap when purchasing a back pack, just dont do it! GO and try it on."
3,Heavy,"Overall its a pretty decent pack, depending on what you are looking for. I am a few inches under 6 feet and have a 32 inch weight, and when I tighten the waste strap all the way, it is barely tight enough, but hopefully I'll gain a few lbs. The pack felt a bit awkward at first, either because I was new to backpacking or I didn't have it set to the proper fit. Now It feels fine except it is very heavy. When empty it feels much heavier than the packs (REI flash 60 or something )of my buddies. I have taken this pack on a few trips all together over 100 miles and it has held up perfectly, and always hold all of my gear, but it is definitely not lightweight, and after a couple dozen miles of carrying it on your back you will feel it. All in all, it does the job, has lasted (so far), fits okay, but is on the heavier side."
4,good read.... maybe a little out-dated now??,"this book seems useful. whether it is or isn't, i'm enjoying it. the style is conversational. not dense at all. as an individual considering whether or not pursuing a Ph.D is worthwhile, I feel like this book has granted me insight into how responsibly consider graduate school.at the same time, i'm concerned this book it a little out of date. the primary reason for my concern is the author's treatment of PCs as a novelty."
4,Good for traditional students,"This book would be very helpful for a traditional student who is looking for a grad program right out of undergrad. There are helpful hints about choosing a program, graduating on time, networking and professionalism. It was less helpful for me, a non-traditional student.We read it in my COM 501 class and it scared a lot of the students because the statistics it relates are grim. According to the book, a lot of graduate students don't finish, and even if they do, the job market for Ph.D.'s is lousy. If you take it all with a grain of salt it is quite helpful and practical."
4,"Finally, an honest book about pursuing graduate degrees","This book offers real and practical advice that you won't get from school advisors and counselors who encourage idealistic students to follow their dreams, to ignore the money and to ignore the job prospects. It provides serious questions every student should consider before embarking on the graduate admissions process. If you make it through the first few chapters and still want to pursue a graduate degree in the arts or humanities, the book also offers straight advice on how to go about it effectively. This book is no fluff. A good buy."
5,"Fantastic, an unparalleled novel.","I first discovered Brad Gooch's work when I was not quite a year out of a relationship. He inspired me then with Scary Kisses, and has yet once again found a way to do the same.Gooch has a style unmatched today. He draws you into his novel's with his intricate detail of character, which makes you feel as if you are one of their ""friend's"" along for the journey. When the novel has ended you are left with a sense of nostalgia, feeling you'll miss visiting with your ""fiend's"" every night.I waited years to find another novel by such a talented and gifted writer, luckily I found it with the same one as before.""The Golden Age of Promiscuity"" is truly another work of art, from one of this centuries most talented writer's; and will certainly last throughout history."
3,"a good book, but one-sided","This is my first book on Heloise and Abelard. But I have to express my dismay at the way we see the whole story from Heloise's perspective. I feel for her and I think the writer has done a good job in creating this character. She is very alive. But Abelard seems cold, selfish, empty and simply not in love with this woman. I wish this book had concentrated a bit more on Abelard, his feelings, etc."
3,Not all snowmen are cute,"Heather is unhappy. Her guardian treats her poorly and she feels alone. Then Snowman turns up, and the terror commences.I borrowed this book some years ago and was disappointed when I read it. I found it predictable, and it never caught my interest. It should have been exciting but it wasn't. It would have been scary if it happened IRL, but reading about it was no thrill. Nothing more than okay.But it sure gave me nightmares though!"
5,"""The"" manual.","This is it, the right way to ride english. Based on good basics with safety first. The best resource to start with to learn about english riding for pleasure or profession. George knows. Read it twice. Thanks George."
5,FANTASTIC Reading!,"This is the first of Torey Hayden's books I read, and I doubt it will be the last! Her insights into the troubled minds of her students is nothing less than inspiring, and her ability to adapt to situations is equally so! I particularly enjoyed the flow of the story, as each child was entered into her class; the adaptations that she made, and the means that she used in spite of the ""system"", to bring each child in to the group. The only point that gives me pause, and makes me think, is the struggles she has when faced with problems. Any educator, no matter how outstanding, can only do so much. It is sad to see, and hard to realize for many, that there are just some children that we cannot ""save"" from society. My own hope: That when I begin teaching; that I can adapt as quickly, and reach the successes portrayed in this book. I recommend it to anyone; educator, parent, or anyone interested in children. It's a MUST read!"
4,Great Collection! Nice Quality,I have this changing table and the crib in natural. It looks great and is well built. We were so happy it came already assembled. We've had it for about 10 months so far and it is holding up really well. My only problem with the crib is that it's hard to attach a mobile or traditional teething rail because the outer rail is wide and curved. Go ahead and buy it. You'll be glad you did!
4,How do I rate thee?,This movie is ridiculous. I love it. Its a cinematic masterpiece. Word to your mother. Thanks Jesus! Your friend Mr. Yonk.
4,Getting the sword out was hard because:,"A)it was not made for California Mountain Snake but for Black Mamba B)at this point CMS was nervous - and in a trailer with limited moving space, fighting a more motivated attacker (with better skills - you cannot assume that because you are both using swords that your opponent will only use swords - assuming you wish to survive anyway."
2,What's with the bleeping?,"When I saw the first ""volume"" of ""Kill Bill"", I asked myself: ""Self, why do they keep bleeping out this chick's name? Is surprise important, here? Does it turn out that she's really Eleanor Roosevelt, or Pam Grier, or something?"" Now, after seeing the second part, I have my answer; it was strategically vital for Tarantino to conceal the fact that his heroine is, in reality, the famous Beatrix Kiddo! Whew. Glad I wasn't spoiled on that one.But now I have another question: how is it possible for a man with this much talent to make such an agonizingly stupid movie?"
4,Good stuff,"I bought this movie because Ive seen it a million times yet never owned either of them. DVD plays, good times."
3,Ear bud too big. makes sore ear.,"I was so excited to try this headset.It is a nice small size, easy to carry and the charger is very cool becase it can connect to car lighter, USB or regular outlet. The sound quality is good. Unfortunately the earbud is too large. I had read this comment in other reviews that said if you have small ears this may fit too tight. I have average ear size and found that after wearing for 15 min my ear was sore. I ended up returning it and purchasing a Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset which I am thrilled with!!!"
3,Sound is lacking,"The headset is remarkably clear and pretty darn small. I like the multiple charging options and the ability to pair with multiple bluetooth devices. The sound clarity is EXCELLENT with one problem, it's not loud enough! When adjusted just right (basically resulting in you needing to hold it in place), the clarity is perfect on my end and on the other end. But walking around, or driving, it shifts and it's hard to hear whomever you're talking to. Great for people at a desk but bad for those on the go."
5,This book is my favorite ever!,"I have read this book 5 times and have enjoyed it every time like it was the first! Karvonen is my favorite character because he is a sarcastic, short, brave, and exaggerating little person...he reminds me of me! Eleret is interesting but way too naive to be realistic, and Daner is the archetype of virtually everyone in the world~egotistical yet courageous.Overall I recommend this book to anyone who can read English~it has everything;action, interesting characters, and a little romance between the two favorites!(P.S. Ms. Wrede, if you're out there, WE WANT A SEQUEL!)"
3,"Paramount Pictures , Stop Giving Us The Same [...] over & Over","The Set Would Have Been A 5+ if the included Assianment Earth (TOS), Timless from Voyager & the visitor from DS9, but no they had give us ""endgame"" again and All Good Things ; which will repeat in the Q set.Give Us better quality not quantity. Enhanced picture and sound. %.1 multi-channel sound sound thx enhanced. Widescreen DS9 episodes like I know you have(late 94'- finale season) & All Of voyager. and Where was Enterprise time travel episodes? there are so many ,2 outstanding ones with the zindi.Pathetic, excuse not to do a new movie or tv show. If your going to end trek get it over with so we can all finally get a life. Give us atleast a big 4 hour tv movie . tie everything in together. Maybe it was all really a dream..............."
1,FA70 Battery did not work,"FA70 Battery did not work/charge at all. Sent back for refund, Its pending over 10 days now. lets see. Adorama is closed on fridya afternonn and saturday so will have to wait till sunday for a refund confirmation/followup."
5,"Sony NP-FA70 InfoLithium A Series Rechargeable Battery Pack for DCR-HC90, DCR-DVD7 & DCR-PC1000 Camcorders",Very pleased on the timing and quality of this product.
5,Builders Bay Sand And Water Table Excellent!!,This was a great purchase for my toddlers. They love it and play hours on end with this. Excellent choice.
3,Of some interest,"It has some well-written passages about the philosophers, but reducing them to a tool or condensing them into such a small space is misleading. Philosophy is more of a way of looking at things than reaching into a toolbox. It, in the end, puts philosophy in deceivingly simplistic terms. I would recommend it for someone burnt out on long, involved philosophic tracts or a beginner."
5,Arban's is THE trumpet method book.,"If an aspiring trumpet player could only have one method book to practice from, Arban's would have to be the one. It has been around for over a hundred years, and has proven itself in time. No trumpet player should be without a copy of this book. It'll help get your mo-jo goin'!"
2,"Good Exercise book, but definitley not my Bible","I have used this book quite a lot, and I am not too thrilled with it. While true that this book has exercises for every technique ever, I use it only as a side line for things, never as a focus. The book gets boring for students very very fast, with it's extreme repetative style, and I personally don't like the way Arban arranges music at all, every song is the same to me. I find that this book is to overwhelming for beginner players most of the time too. What I recommend most of the time is play solo songs that you enjoy, practice them, and when you come to a trouble spot in it, find an exercise in Arbans that can help you work it out. Definitly a good book, and is always helpful in a trumpeters library, but NOT my trumpet Bible."
4,FINALLY a cell phone headset worth using!,"I have tried them all... cheap ones, bluetooth ones (Jabra and Sony Ericsson), expensive ones (Jabra and Plantronics) and they have all been terrible in one or more areas. This headset is:1. Loud enough so I actually have to turn DOWN the volume on my phone when I use it.2. Clear enough so I don't repeat ""What?"" over and over again, AND callers can understand ME too!3. Comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time*.*If you don't like earbuds that actually insert INTO your ear then this isn't for you. This headset goes well into your ear canal."
1,terrible,"this book was rife with errors, which I realized after several sample tests, so it made me question the entire content. I passed the fsot anyway, but this is a ""must skip."""
1,Appallingly Bad,Poorly executed and badly out of date. A great deal of the information in this book is misleading or irrelevant and it should be pulled from the market.
2,Skip this,"There is some useful info in here, but, like other reviewers have said, there are plenty of wrong answers in the sample questions. That kind of obviates the whole point of buying it as a study guide."
1,Terrible Study Guide,"This guide has many wrong answers and questions that don't make sense. For example one of the questions in the practice test, refers to a passage and asks what punctuation should come after the word ""bodies."" However, the sentence in question does not contain the word 'bodies.' There are many more examples of the guide not being edited or written well.I agree with other reviewers that his guide may cause more confusion than help. I also hope that the actual FSOT is not as outdated as this guide. It refers to floppy disks multiple times as though they are a new and relevant technology.If this is your only option for studying - good luck. If you have other options use them instead."
4,It's worth getting this for Foreign Service test practice.,"I felt that the best way to prepare for the Foreign Service Officer Test (i.e., the written exam) was to do as many sample tests as possible. This book gives you an ample supply of test questions in all areas of the test, with explanations for each answer (including why the wrong answers are wrong). Coupled with other sources of test samples (e.g., the Foreign Service Study Guide from the State Department), it will give you a broad range of experience with test questions. And the price is reasonable."
2,The sofa of float tubes; customer service questionable,"The good: Roomy, decent pocket space and very light. The bad: Doesn't sit very high in the water as advertised; kinda slow compared to others if you need to cover water and, oh, yeah, it arrived with a leaking bladder. Classic Accessories replaced it, but it took persistence and more than a month. It's good if you need a LOT of room, but otherwise it's just OK. These are co-branded with Trout Unlimited, so it comes with a free membership."
2,"lousily argumented book, but not without value...",I think the only thing this book succeeds at isat criticising leftist activism in northamerica of the last decades. Makes some goodpoints about it's weaknesses. But as a criticismof non-violence in general or as an advocacy ofviolent or armed struggle it utterly fails.Lousily argumented throughout.The author doesn't even seem to have understoodthat non-violence isn't equal to passivity.Am still looking forward to read From a native sonthough. Hope it holds more water than this one.
5,Read it and find yourself intrigued!,"The opening of the book with the unknown accused is fantastic, one cannot help to continue reading. As the book unravels fragmenst and anecdotes of the history of the Virgin, it is woven in with the current work of the resoterer in an intricate way, that leaves you no room to put the book down. Read it and give youself a good dosage of history, mystery and sensualism."
2,"Big Breasts, but small budget.","This in NOT ""The Magnificent Seven"" movie western. This is an adult video featuring seven very well endowed women in a series of seductive strip-teases. The women are attractive, if a little average. Clearly, the emphasis here is on size, not looks. But the video is pretty good over all, even though the production values seem a little amateurish."
5,DHill1616,Thank You! I got the music immediately in my smart phone. The product will be recommended to friends and family.
3,Carthage for Beginners,"It's often repeated that the Roman Empire was huge. However, historians and teachers then just focus on the City and don't discuss pre-colonial life. (A small exception is seen in Russell Crowe's ""Gladiator"" character being from Spain.) This documentary speaks of Carthage before and during the Roman conquest. Carthage is now what we call Tunisia.This is a British documentary probably meant from British audiences. The scholars interviewed are not diverse. Many have teeth that could be featured in the Simpsons' ""Big Book of British Smiles."" The work has computer graphics and actors pretending to be ancient people.The work goes into why Carthage was important, how it got its name, etc. Like much on Rome, they speak of gladiators, bath houses, and mosaics.I wasn't glued to this documentary. However, I appreciated what I learned and thank the makers for putting it together."
5,a good reason,"Very well researched and easy to read. McPherson tries to be fair to both sides of the war, giving the good and the bad, but it is rather obvious that he favors the North."
5,Why men fought,"James McPherson has brought together thousands of letters along with over 200 diaries in a wonderfully done book on why men fought during the war. When walking upon the fields of battle it's hard to believe that many regiments continually advanced into overwhelming fields of fire. What prompted these men into action, and better yet, what causes were they fighting? Their motivation was religion, as well as duty and honor.This book answers those questions in an easy to read epigrammatic format. McMherson's analysis has brought forth an outstanding work in regards to the sacrifices put forth during the Civil War. I highly recommend this book for budding historians as well as the serious researcher. It's both captivating and thought provoking."
5,Peak Coltrane Quartet,"This video captures a rare performance of Coltrane backed by the classic quartet (McCoy Tyner, Elvin Jones, and Garrison). As usual, Coltrane does not let down. The only weakness to this tape is that it is only 25 minutes long. However, it is a fantastic 25 minutes to spend."
5,Thanks,"Thank you! Got everything in one week instead of promised three. Right on New Year, appreciated a lot quality and product condition. Thanks again."
4,Pretty good,I bought why do men marry bitches along with her other book why do men love bitches and Dating by Gloria JeanDatingAll 3 are really good books. I would recommend them all. If you have one of the bitches books you don't necessarily need to by the second bitches book because they are pretty much the same. But you could still by the Dating by Gloria JeanDatingVery good book. Definitely is an eye opener to what you could be doing wrong in your dating life.
4,Babe In Total Control of Herself a.k.a. BITCH,I feel this book was a guideline and confirmation that a woman should set some rules. It happened to be common sense and jewels that my grandmother and aunts have said to me. Now I just apply them and know its okay. Some things are a little unrealistic but maybe I just never faced those kind of situations. It's defienitely an eye opener.
3,Its just a guide,"I have read her first book and recently purchase this one. While I don't agree with everything she say, I did find the books to be interesting. I'm giving it 3 stars because I don't think she gave this one much thought. The first book was much better.In the end I think the point of her books are don't ""lose yourself"" to get a man. If you didn't cook five course meals before, you shouldn't have to start just because a new man is in your live.As with any self help book, (relationships, money trouble, weight) this is just a guide. Yes some points are stretched, but others are right on point."
1,Great Inspiration for adolecents who want to succed !,"I gave a copy of the book to my 18 year old nice , who at the time was in living with some emotional distress , after she read the book , she became to understand what a person needs to do, in order to succed. Wich is not an easy thing to do . By falowing some guide lines and studying the ways in wich of some of the woman interviewed in the book , personally aply to obtain all the mayor goals in their lives , she stop procrastinating and start taking some meassured actions to star climbing the lader of her young life. What the book gave her was the first steps to find the courage to fallow the righ pad to belive in her self."
5,Great DVD!,"This is a very nice DVD collection of all of Marilyn's movie trailers, with 14 news reels, all very good Quality fun to watch, rare footage of her singing ""Dimonds"" to the troops! The bonus was a old special from 1964 called ""The Legend of Marilyn"", rare footage of her mother, interviews with close friends and first husband. This is well worth buying if you are a big Marilyn fan like me. Nicely put together."
1,Non-hardening wood putty ???,"I guess I should have read the instructions before I bought the product. It never gets hard! I'm still trying to figure out what use there would be for a wood filler that never gets hard. Even Playdoh gets hard. Maybe I'm missing something. Stupid me. I bought two different shades to match my darker wood projects. Now I'm staring at the nice jars, wondering what to do with them."
1,The most USELESS CRAP imaginable,"Why in the world would you EVER want a wood ""repair"" product that stays soft and can be rubbed off? Repairing ""WOOD"" generally leads one to think of something that, in the end, will be something like actual wood. A product that matches the surface color, but stays soft like clay is pretty much useless for any sort of wooden object that is meant to be used is any way. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT if you expect it to be anything like wood!If you want a TEMPORARY COVER for a wood defect, this will do the job. You won't be able to see the repair until it gets rubbed off. The nice thing is that it will be easy to put back on again to cover the defect until the next time it gets rubbed off.What a GREAT marketing SCAM!""Hey, use this stuff to cover defects (and when it rubs off, you can put more on! And keep buying this crap forever!)""."
2,walking tall the trilogy nlu-ray,"I ended up sending the movie back twice. Maybe it was my player, but other new release and re-released blue-ray titles played fine. Even after I upgraded my software on the player. I ended up buying the dvd set"
1,very disappointed,Did not receive all the dvd's in a trilogy set so I returned them and never received a refund. I have been trying to get answers for a few months now and have gotten nothing!
3,Man show,My husband liked the original. He was happy but if you get it you need to remember when it was made and motion pictures have come a long way since then. He loved the story line and has shared his movies with his father.
5,Awesome ending,"nothing more to say, the ending season of FMAB is perfect and outstanding. And the price is much cheaper than other local stores. I also love 4 postcards included with the DVD."
5,Blu-ray looks and sounds great,"Big fan of the first anime, and watched Brotherhood from the start, streamed from Japan. Seen the complete series a number of times. Buying these discs was a no-brainer. Question is, how do they live up to my expectations?The animation is as smooth and rich as I had hoped for: Greed vs Wrath (and afterward), Sloth vs the Armstrongs, Mustang vs Envy, and the ""Promised Day"" main battle are terrific, eye-popping visuals. Sound is much better than I expected.On a side note, the Blu-rays are my first experience with the English dub. Better than expected, but doesn't pack the emotional punch of the original Japanese voice acting. A great example is Ed's (Romi Park's) soliloquy at the end of the battle, before going after Alphonse."
2,NOT for Beginners,"This workout is extremely difficult. My husband works out regularly and could not even complete the workout. I am a beginner and quit fifteen minutes into the video, after i was not able to complete anything. It is a great workout if you are in super great shape and want to challenge yourself. However if you are like me and want something for beginners I DO NOT recommend this workout. The poeple doing the workout in the DVD could not even complete it."
3,Not for the obese beginner!,"Because Bob Harper is known for working with the morbidly obese on The Biggest Loser and the title of this workout is ""Beginner's Weight Loss"", I was so excited to find and purchase this dvd. I am 100+ lbs overweight, in my early 30's and actually I used to do crazy workouts before my weight gain but because I am now so heavy, I have serious back pain and no core strength. This workout was not impossible but dangerous for someone in my shape being that you have no one to corrrect your form. The toned,fit ppl doing this workout in the dvd looked exhausted because there is no break to catch your breath during the intervals..that meant 45 minutes of straight cardio. I am quite dissapointed in this purchase but I will say if you can work your strength up or if you have the agility then this is a great workout.(hard to do on carpet, can not do barefoot and need flexible shoes + hand weights)"
3,"It's OK, but boring...","I have to read this book for a college class. I've only read the first two chapters, but I agree with the other reviews. The content is easy to understand, the author makes some good points. This book can be thought provoking, but overall, it's pretty boring and repetitive."
5,A wonderful first movie!,"I'm so glad to see Jean-Michel Cousteau making films again. It was about time! People need to be informed about the condition of our planet now more than ever. We have to do something!The quality of this documentary is excellent. Visually, it's filmed and edited in a dynamic way. Never gets boring. As for the content, it's rich. We get to visit all these GORGEOUS atolls and meet interesting people working to preserve them! Really nice! So far, it's my favorite ""Ocean Adventure"". It's just a wonderful journey. Oh, and the narration is by Pierce Brosnan, which is nice.Anyway, great DVD! Jean-Michel Cousteau's work is great and I hope to see more and more of these films!"
1,Boring!!!!,Jean Michel should have payed closer attention to his dad. After a very boring 1st DVD I was hoping that the 2nd DVD would improve - it didn't!
1,JUNK,"I'm glad we spent little more than a buck plus shipping for this. Slapped together, even a long section with no images or audio during. Definitely a rather hodge podge collection of Elvis movie triilers, many seen elsewhere. No substance. Elvis would be sad."
2,Not the Greatest,This program is great for explanations on how to perform math equations but it doesn't have a lot of practice problems. It wasn't exactly what I was looking for.
1,eJay DJ Mixstation,"I want to advise you that DJ MIX STATION doesn't have too many resources and it MIXES, doesn't MAKE music."
1,false description,"The R154D unit itself seems pretty nice. But I didn't get the 3-pack I was expecting, just 1, making it overpriced. Returned for refund."
1,Disturbing,"After listening to this CD, I began to wonder how anyone at anytime could even survive listening to anthing this awful. Maybe if you're on drugs, this msic may inspire a good trip, but for anyone sane do not even contemplate purchasing this CD."
1,shipping,when you pay for ewxpedited shipping you expect expedited shipping and 6 days is not expedited shipping
2,Fangs don't bite,"""Fangs"" is a borderline movie,attempting to be a horror movie,but trying its hand at comedy at the same time. The mousy detective and the handsome animal control officer (with a ditzy teenaged daughter) try to solve the mystery of killer bats and save the Apple Blossom Festival. Corbin Bernsen stars as a sleazy real estate developer.""Fangs"" has its funny moments. The bats look toothless,and it isn't gory. In trying comedy and horror,it fails (spectacularly) at both."
3,Somewhat limited history of vampire films.,"This somewhat uneven history of vampire films takes you from the 20's through about 1990, through a selection of movie trailers and some film clips. Of varying sound and picture quality, rough editing and lack of rights to show clips for a good number of films, is fairly narrow in its presentation. Showing trailers from the Universal series and Hammer series, in addition to a few other films here and there, doesn't give you any real background or much research, and no interviews. From after 1975 all the films are represented only with VHS box covers. Buy instead Flesh and Blood about Hammer Films which is much better, but don't expect anything new here, except some nice shots and narration by Veronica Carlson, who hosts the program. 60 minutes."
3,Not perfect but acceptable,The product was not like new but it worked. The vendor was very nice and helpful. New videos of this type are hard to find.
5,Daughter loved them,"My daughter like playing with them, the pictures on the square especially seemed to amuse her. When she out grew them, they transitioned into dog toys and lasted for a while, so I'd consider them to be durable enough."
5,A SUSPENSEFUL BATTLE OF WITS,"THIS IS A SUPERB TALE OF A KIDNAPPER VERSUS THE POLICE. THE KIDNAPPER SEEMS TO KNOW BEFOREHAND EVERY MOVE THE POLICE MAKE. ONE COP DECIDES SHE MUST ABANDON HER SENSE OF FAIR PLAY AND ""GET DOWN AND DIRTY"" INTO THE VILLAIN'S WORLD."
2,Not a fitting conclusion to an excellent series,Coming after four books which I had enjoyed immensely this was a huge disappointment. All the questions which were posed in the previous books just seemed to be completely ignored and left me feeling cheated. Mr Card please spend some time writing a proper conclusion to this series.
1,A little too moralistic & patronising.,"I wanted to like this. I really enjoyed the previous 4 books, but this one left me feeling cold. The blatant moralising was a bit too much. Shouldn't the characters be allowed to make up their own minds? A disappointing ending to an otherwise original and entertaining series"
1,Not worth it,"You get what you pay for. These are EXTREMELY lightweight, and are hardly up to the task of any serious cooking. Expect scorch marks on the bottom of these when you first use them, and if the burner burns through the bottom, I won't be at all surprised.You'd be better off spending $10 more for a better quality set, you will save money in the long run as these will need to be replaced reasonably soon."
1,You get what you pay for! (maybe less),"While the set looked good in the listing, on first use we found that there was much more to the story. The pans are very thin and heat unevenly, causing hot spots that ruin the food. The simple task of making popcorn became a headache with half the kernels burned and the other half unpopped. (And the burned ones stuck to the bottom of the pan, never to be removed) The handles are incredibly flimsy, I'd be afraid to lift the big sauccepan when full, it would probably give out and send your food to the floor.In short, don't bother with this junk, spend a few extra bucks and get a quality set."
1,beware -- not as shown,Just received my Rain Drip hose and it is not as it is shown in the picture. It is only tubing (in brown not black) and has no connectors on either end. Useless! Product description does not accurately describe the fact that this is not a complete drip hose.
3,"Quick, fast read but...",This book is a quick and easy read. However I feel her characterizations of the working class people are stereotypical and incompletely realized. She does much better with her portraits of those who lead more privileged lives. I have to agree with other reviewers in that her stories just stop as if she doesn't really know how to end them. I can't help wondering if this book would have gotten less attention if Ms. Miller did not have a very famous father (Arthur Miller) and husband (Daniel Day Lewis).
4,Great satirical stories!,"Personal Velocity is a dark, stark, insightful and satirical collection of short stories. All seven stories are terrific, but the ones with Greta, Louisa and Paula are, in my opinion, the most riveting and humorous ones in the book. Rebecca Miller has grasped the lives of today's single women down to a tee. She covers all the vital details of modern women -- career, relationships, sex -- with a unique brand of dark humor all her own. This isn't a lighthearted chick lit, but a literary piece of women's fiction. With sharp dialogue, unsentimental language and excellent prose, Miller has written quite a memorable satire. I couldn't recommend this book enough."
3,One Size Never Fits All,The thumb hole has to be cut out to fit. The plastic insert has to be cut down to stay in it's pocket. If you have a large wrist this item may be too small.
5,excepcional album,"la musica de brasil no deja nunca de asombrarnos. Su riqueza es dificil de igualar. Lenine es una nueva y encantadora muestra de ello. Con un estilo muy distintivo y diferente de lo ""clasico brasilero"" con una mezcla de tropicalia con musica nordestina (forro) y algo de rock,nos enseña como la musica de este pais evoluciona permanentemente, sin dejar de ser ""tipica y unicamente"" brasilera. Lenine es uno de esas apariciones musicales que nos llenan de placer. Bellas canciones , bien tratadas, ritmo contagioso, en fin un cd y un musico que hacen honor a su origen y que deben poseer todos los que gusten (alguien no ?)del asombroso universo musical de brasil"
2,"Some good, more bad","I recently bought this book to discover what secrets lie in my Visor Platinum. There are some good hints and it is a nice supplement to the user guide. The first few pages of every chapter were useful, then things went downhill. The thing I didn't like about this book is the number of pages devoted to all the software you can buy and download to make your Visor really work effectively. It seemed the book was almost completely devoted to third-party software that you needed to buy. I would have been much happier if it dealt with what was on my Visor rather than trying to convince me I needed to sink another [price] into third-party software. This is a great book if you are looking for a resource into third-party software, but a poor book if you just want to use your Visor without spending the money on more software."
5,"an incredibly well-written, thorough account of story.","Anne Maier is truly a remarkable crime writer with the ability to make even the most humdrum details of a case interesting. This book is highly recommended for anyone interested in high quality crime fiction. It reads like a detective novel, yet contains all the factual data of a news article. Five Stars!!"
4,Little package big punch,"I haven't got to use this like I was hoping too but from just the little we have used it, it is as advertised. My daughter used it on a recent trip to the hospital and while I was in test all day it kept her occupied. Only trouble was finding seating to keep it plugged in. The batteries truly only did work for about 2 hours or one movie. I like that now when I get the chance I can plug it up to the little TV in my computer room and watch a movie on the TV. The TV is one of those all in one with VHS player that bit the dust long ago and since the TV part works great I'm just too cheap to replace right now. But I tried this and it works great as a DVD player. Can't wait to try out some of the other features, like playing CD's or picture CD's especially at work when I'm shoved away in my little hole."
4,This Marker is Just Right for Your Furniture...It's a Stain Marker,"It doesn't take very long for a cabinet, a table, or other wood furniture to take on scratches, once you have this piece of furniture in your house. MINWAX produces a number of ""marker type"" stain markers to touch up and stain whatever it is that needs that little cover up.We're not talking about major refinishing of the exterior of your kitchen cabinets, desk, or bookcases; these markers will replace the space with a compatible match; just check the chart which shows the shade of wood finish, and try your hand at repairing a simple scratch.It is rather inexpensive, and you are more than likely going to use this marker a few more times."
2,Disappointed,"This stain pen is very runny (at least the one I got), does not stain the color it says, not even after multiple applications. It's ""ok"" for skinny scratches, but no nicks. Definitely disappointed."
1,Did not stain for me..,"I tried this because it seemed like a simple idea and I had such small areas to fix on my table. I left the stuff on the area over night and it did not stain it. Lucky for me no one an see it. Maybe it will work for you. Also, the smell is so bad may need a fan."
2,Not Pretty,"I purchased this product to touch up burn marks caused by lit charcoals falling onto our cherry hardwood floors. After cutting out the black marks, sanding it down, and using this product, I can say that the discoloration looks worse than if I had done nothing at all."
1,A Dirty Marketing Trick!,"Beware! This film has been misleadingly re-packaged and re-marketed in 2010 with the faces of three big kung fu stars on the cover BUT this is NOT a martial arts film! It is a self-indulgent Chinese propaganda film that is slow, boring and long-winded. Even though the new dvd cover states 'starring Jet Li, Jackie Chan and Donnie Yeung' these actors get bit parts for a matter of a few seconds - Jackie Chan takes some finding as a bespectacled Journalist with a moustache. If you are looking for a 'House of the Flying Daggers' type kung fu movie, then save your money! If you want a Chinese history lesson, then also save your money and buy something that is not so tedious and innacurate historically."
4,Flying high up in the sky---leads to love,"I selected this book because the author has the same last name as I have. I was hoping that I would learn of a long lost relative. Well, I am confident that Sharon Sanders is not a relative of mine at all. As a matter of fact, I learned that the name is a pseudonym for Robert A. Deckert. Surfice it to say, Deckert is not a relative either.Inspite of the confusion in the author's name, the book was an interesting one. Handsome Derek Reid flys into the heart of lovely Diana Gardner after establishing himself as one of her trusted flight trainers, businessman turned defender. This was a short story which again shows that hard work pays off and committment to estabishing oneself (Diana) as a bonafide flying/training/flight escort business can lead to everlasting love. How I love a LOVE STORY!!! Beverly C. Sanders"
3,Not bad...,"Harnoncourt conducts the piece with dedication and importance, He doesn't walk it on by like Welser-Most.The playing is a bit muddy and the sound is much better than the EMI, good cast too.There is a interview in the booklet, along with full translations of the text.But...If you want to have Franz Schmidt's great Magnum Opus oratorio, get the Horst Stein version on Calig, its intense and radiant! Best I've heard yet!"
4,Good scooter helmet for the $$,"This was great for the money, but it is a little loud. I know use this for only going 5-20 blocks and got a full face for my 45min commute."
3,"Does the job, but looks ridiculous","Just received the helmet 3 days ago and promptly boxed it up for return. The second I put it on, my girlfriend burst out laughing. I thought she was exaggerating, but looking in the mirror, immediately that movie Spaceballs came to mind. While the helmet seems like it would protect your head just fine... it definitely gives the bobble head look. I went to a local store (which I now suggest new helmet shoppers should do) and found one that didn't look so silly(and this is surprisingly hard to find) I've posted a side by side pic in the review so you can see the difference between this helmet and the one I purchased locally.The helmet also sat a little high on the head, and was very warm. I would advise buying one locally... the extra money you spend will be saved by avoiding shipping costs for return."
5,A MOVIE WAITING TO HAPPEN,"Sins Of The Father is a truely wonderful read. Jane Jenson takes you on a wonderful ride of thought and intrigue as well as an interesting education of New Orleans culture through voodoo, mystery and romance. I can definitely see this book as a movie and this is how I saw it in my mind. Although Ms Jenson has written two sequels to this original computer game series set in other countries, I would love her to return Gabriel to New Orleans. A must read."
3,good for beginners,"Hope you have lots of room in your living room. I had a bit of trouble with the second 20 minute video. You need a bit more space cause they do steps going right to left. They aren't hard, just I have a small space to work out in. She is energetic, but I found that you're just getting your heart rate up and they start to do the cool down. I also found that the cool down moves would be difficult for someone who just got over an injury or is overweight. So, buyer beware on this one."
2,Very Little Kickboxing,I bought this tape believing that it would be an aerobic kickboxing video. Instead I got edits from a television show. Very poorly made. It is just an overrated fast paced aerobic workout with hardly any kicking at all. If you want a great toning video try any of the Lotte Berk Series.
3,Onion Holders,Purchased these to barbecue onions in a Weber Kettle. They worked out great. A little hard to clean. Yet they do work.
5,Can't taste a difference between this and wheat laden pasta,This stuff is great & even my husband can't taste a difference between this and wheat laden pastas. I use this anywhere that would call for a regular pasta and it works out just fine. My son has a gluten allergy & I order this by the case with the free super saver shipping and it's a real deal. It tastes great and cooks well. I've tried other pastas and they come out tasting sticky or off... this stuff tastes similar to a whole wheat version I'd find at the grocery store.
3,Looks nothing like Emily,"Although I is a very well made train. It doesn't look anything like Emily at all. They could have used something close to the design they had for lady in the movie, ""Thomas and the Magic Railroad."" It's not a bad train, just doesn't look like she should."
5,Great cutters,These are so cute and work great. Great for making cookie cut out sandwiches. Clean easy!
2,Make noise so loud!,"It looks so cheap and makes noise so loud when it runs! Definitely, you cannot put in your bedroom if you want to have a good sleep!"
4,Our girls love it,We have purchased 2 of these clocks in 2 separate years so we must like it. Both of our girls' rooms have this clock in them and both of the girls love it. Keeps time well and we haven't had to change a battery in 2 years. The only item to tell others about is that the 2nd hand is quite loud. Some kids may find that soothing. Others may not. Our girls do not notice it and have no trouble sleeping at other places where there is no constant ticking.
4,Punk Rock!,"Everyone has to understand the history of real punk rock, and this is a great starting place, and the fact they are from Australia makes them even cooler. Great songs, energy, very authentic. A must have for any musicologist!"
4,Works but flimsy,"It works pretty well of the various laptop shades I tested, and wound up being the only one I kept. It's unfortunately a little flimsy, likely so that it would collapse easier for storage. But it stays on even if there's a bit of wind, and after a while you don't even notice it's there, unlike some of the others I tested which tend to fly off in the slightest breeze. Other than flimsiness, my only complaint would be that the black material seems to heat up the screen in the sun, but I think I'm just nitpicking.Unfortunately, as I found out with these things, until you try it on your model laptop you can't be certain of fit. This version being elastic, will probably fit most but not all 17 inchers. For reference, I'm using it on a 2009 Unibody 17"" Macbook Pro."
3,Training Sounds,"As I am a senior and have ridden on trains when they were the mode of transportation of the day and remember the feels and sounds of sitting in a rail coach for many hours this was when they came to you selling food and papers to read up and down the ailse and also you could smell the coal smoke and the clickity clack and the gentle shaking of the car was something you don't get today and this tape of Sleeping on a Train is only a fraction of what you experience on THE REAL THING but at least it is a reasonable accounting of the sounds and if one has never ridden on a real train at least you can hear what it may of sounded like,but if you remember the real thing this will at least stir up memmories."
3,it was........ok,"I was a little disapointed i thought it would be awesome,but it was just good. When i went to blockbuster and i read the back and saw the deadly game match i thought like a humoungeus battle royal,but instead it was just like a king of the ring.anyway, I couldnt believe that stone cold lost to mankind! darn the mcmahon family! the other mathes were good. the new age outlwas vs lo mdown vs headbangers 8/10 great match got to hand it to the roaddogg and billygunn. sable vs jauqline woo! what a match.8/10 sable kiked butt. mcmahon family sucks!! good PPV"
4,Survivor Series,"Survivor Series is a brilliant PPV. However, it's let down by the Steven Regal vs X Pac and Mankind vs Mystery Opponent matches. This PPV has some exciting moments, especially the final match in the tournament for the then vacant WWF Championship. Also, The Rock sets a new WWF record! If you want to find out, buy this video. It's a deadly game. It's a great game."
2,I was terrible!,This pay-per-view was horrible. The matches were disappointing and Mankinds mystery opponent was stupid.All the Boss Man matches sucked. There was irony from Survivor Seriese '97 in the final match.
2,WWF Survivor Series 1998 - Deadly Game REVIEW!,"Following the previous year's controversial but highly-entertaining Series, this one was a huge dissapointment. Rather than the usual eight or ten man elimination tag matches, they decided to have a tournament for the World Title.We had Vince McMahon making an angle that mocked the ""real"" incident from the 1997 Survivor Series as The Rock became the ""Corporate Champion"". The event itself was just all the tournament matches leading up to a battle between The Rock and Mick ""Mankind"" Foley. We also got to see a pretty average tag team title match featuring New Age Outlaws, The Headbangers, and the Mark Henry/D-Lo Brown team."
4,Great product for indoor pullups,"I really like that this bar sticks out away from the doorway so you do not hit your head on the door frame when doing pull ups. It also allows you to do wide grip pull ups. I have a very small door way trim and there is no problem keeping the bar in place.The one downside are the two small black marks (and slight depressions) on the doorway trim from the foam on the support bar (where all the weight is). They aren't very noticeable, but I don't think I will be able to get it off."
4,Completely happy with this product,"This product works great. The instructions didn't really help, but as long as you have some intelligence it's very easy to assemble. I put some t-shirts on the parts that touch the door frame and wall to keep it from leaving any marks, and it has worked so far. Excellent product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a normal sized door."
5,King Of TV...King Of Queens.......,"Perfect, Just perfect, right when you thought it couldnt get better it just did with season 3 of King Of Queens.This product is so worth the money and the entertainment value is amazing!!!!Every episode is so funny in its own way and the story lines just keep coming.The packaging is really well made and the quality is perfect!If you are looking for really good funny antertainment, the King Of Queens is a must buy!!! I cant wait for season 4 and 5!!!!!"
3,Non-matching handsets,"The #2 and #3 handsets did not match the #1 handset. They work, but since the three are not alike, they must be operated using different buttons, differently. Seems the people who packed and shipped the items juist threw in two which were compatible, but not alike. Disappointed in the seller."
1,Tina Flaherty is a joke,"Don't waste your time or money reading this book. Tina is a cruel, heartless woman and married for money. Her husband dumped her for a sweeter, kinder woman. Any man can be the right man. Don't be afraid to give a man your heart and ask for nothing in return. A man will give you everything you want since he only wants to be loved, which is something Tina knows nothing about. Yes, you can be successful in your career, but remember to be kind to people you work with. Kindness goes much further than ambition. Just don't treat people the way Tina does. She treats everyone is her life like they are her servants and feels she is justified in doing so since she has millions of dollars. She's very proud of the fact that she is a multi-millionaire. But, is she proud that she does not have one true friend, only her dogs? People don't like her...just her money. She will die very rich, but very poor in the soul."
4,Tracker-Outdoors.com Review of A Dogs History Of America,"Tracker-Outdoors.com found Derr's writing compelling and very well researched. He kindly shows just how many places and events dogs have been involved with. Derr's tales of mayhem, heroism, exploration, hard work, betrayal, kindness, abuse and love demonstrates clearly the elements that attract people to dogs. History enthusiasts will enjoy the historic content within these pages tremendously. A Dog's History Of America tells the remarkable tales of American history that will inspire dog owners of all kinds. Overall, we found Derr's book fascinating reading but somewhat disturbing. Mark Derr explores the roles of sled dogs, dogs of war, guide dogs and show ring dogs from a historical perspective. We highly recommend A Dog's History Of America to dog lovers, history buffs and those interested in American culture.Tracker Outdoorswww.tracker-outdoors.com"
2,not worth $12,"When I received The Book Club Party Game, I was suprised at its size, It's a small box with about 6 cards inside. The games were okay but nothing to write home about. I could have found more games from the internet for free. I played the game with my book club and we all agree it's not worth the money."
3,"New generation of Learning Curve - Plastic, Plastic, Plastic","Murdoch is the most plasticky of the Thomas engines we have bought. His geometry is also poor if you have the older ""clickity clack"" style of tracks (specifically, he bumps going up ascenders). My son loves his look and he is stylish, but the wheel arrangement (mentioned in numerous other reviews) leaves Murdoch a little stiff for cornering.So he is a handsome engine, and a little awkward, but this engine has A LOT of plastic. The newer engines just keep getting more and more plastic parts. It seems antithetical to the ""wooden railway"" ethic to have so much plastic on an engine - even a really useful one."
5,PJ's trains,"My grandson loves these trains. Very durable and creative. Stimulates his imagination and a great toy to teach sharing. This dealer is great, fast service."
4,Classic Australian Story picture,"well written picture of Australian outback life,interesting charactersI have read several of his books and recently enjoyed the movie The Eye of the Storm"
2,Fails to meet a high standard,"This series of annual publications from SABR has set a high standard of scholarship, research and writing. However, this year's offering is a decided lull. The editing appears sloppy with numerous errors, typos, and dull editorial writing, not seen elsewhere in this worthy series."
1,Confusing,"Thought it a real handyman's book that give a rule of thumb in simple tasks. It consists of pages upon pages of screw sizes and other very useless info. Buy for reference in regards to what size of this comes in, but for assistance in actual installation it's a big O."
3,Repeat,"I have Thomas J. Glover's ""Pocket Ref (2nd, 3rd, & 4th editions) and found much of the information contained in this to be almost the same. The different information is more along the lines of calculating design requirements. Not something a ""handyman"" would be doing in my opinion."
3,simple observations,"Where to start. This item is not made particularly well. It vaguely resembles the photo on amazon. The strings are Very far apart and thus do not make an effective ""privacy curtain"". It is not advertised as such, but I was hoping it would provide enough coverage to obscure what was on either side of the curtain. I could probably have made a better one myself, sans the painting, but the cost in time/labor would have been too costly. Thanks anyway."
4,"Usefull, but I didn't like the book quality","The book was usefull and it's a good guide, but the overall quality of the book itself is really bad. And the layout and size of the book also.It looks as, it's a travellers book, but they don't have the traveller in mind when they have to do the paperback."
2,"Good for fun, BAD for durability","I took this out with my 5-year-old and broke the two propellers that came with it within 30 minutes. I thought, ""I just suck at flying this thing."", and when I tried to order new propellers, shipping was extremely expensive, and these plastic propellers are two dollars each.A few weeks later I saw the same plane being flow by another father with his son, both propellers broke in the first few flights. You decide...coincidence, or global RC airplane conspiracy against well-meaning dads?"
4,Pretty good,"Pretty good, almost too ridiculous though. And geared for short attention spans...episodes seem like they are about 5 minutes long, if that."
4,REALLY GOOD BOOK,"This book was a very good read. It was kind of hard to get into, and a little slow at first, but it got really good, and I never regreted buying it."
4,German Sensation,"This CD has a great beat. I really have no idea what the words mean, but she is a very smooth rapper. I first heard this when I was stationed in Europe. She also has a new one that is out, but I don't think available in US yet. Anyone who likes rap, this cd is for you."
4,Finger puppets,"The finger holes are a little small for an adult finger. I purchased to play with my baby while we read. I think it will be fine, and when he is older he can play himself. The blue hair on things one and two tends to shed."
4,cute finger puppets,I bought these to decorate a Dr. Seuss diapercake.They are adorable and just the right size.Would've super cute to use alongside the books.
4,Age Range Should be Specified,"In a homeschooling catalog, this book is listed as being appropriate for very young students...grades k-2. Perhaps if that had been noted here, the reader from South Carolina would not have felt compelled to diss the book so scathingly.This is very well done for the younger set."
1,Very poorly written!,"I used ""The Well Trained Mind"" for 1 year with my 5th grader. I then bought ""Story of the World"" with high hopes of using it with my 1st grader. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. The book is very poorly written, shockingly so, considering Wise Bauer co-authored ""The Well Trained Mind."" It is very simplisticly written, told in a ""kitchy,"" irritating tone of voice, not told chronologically, and full of exclamation points. Comparing it to Hillyer's ""A Child's History of the World"" (written for 1st-4th graders) and even E.D. Hirsch's K, 1st, and 2nd grade ""Core Knowledge Series"" history sections, ""Story of the World"" looks as though it was written by a 1st-4th grader.I gave the book to Goodwill. In fact Wise Bauer's books reflect so poorly on the ""Well Trained Mind"" teaching method that I've stopped using that book as well."
1,This book is full of errors.,You know that a history book is bad when your ten year old is pointing out mistake after mistake as they read it (and he was reading a revised edition.) I'm glad that I borrowed ours from the library. I do not think it's worth spending money on.
5,Classical homeschool,"Even more fun with the activity book. Better for the younger ones, say under 10 years old, but still enjoyable for older kids."
1,The Biblical quotes are inaccurate; calls the whole book into question,"We have just began using volume 1 of this series as part our daughter's homeschool studies. In several instances the author appears to be quoting excerpts of text from historical sources. However, her ""excerpts"" from the biblical books of Genesis and Exodus are not accurate quotes at all, nor even simple paraphrases. They are instead interpretive extrapolations of the biblical accounts, including information not found in the Bible and leaving out details pertinent to the historic accounts found there. While the ""excerpts"" from Daniel and Luke seem a little truer to the original source, the implied representation of all these segments as quotes from historical sources is very misleading. It causes me to doubt the accuracy of all the apparent quotes from the other ancient stories she has cited, and I find I cannot trust the author's scholarship in general. Very disappointing."
3,Religion-entric,"This book has a spotty review of man's early history, centered around different religious beliefs and the conflict these creates. It begins with nomadic tribes, omitting any history before the development of humankind. It uses overly simplistic cultural stories to engage young history readers. My girls are six, so this is fine for them. It is great if you are Catholic or Christian and and want a book to supplement Creationism. Otherwise, look for a more science-based, history-based text."
4,Engaging,My son read this in a couple of days. He loved it. I do think you need to supplement if you want to ensure proper history is taught but as an introduction I thinks great. He flew through the first 3 volumes. He is begging for book 4.
1,christian mythology,"Never buy these books. There is no history in these series. The author's condescending tone to the young readers is inappropriate. But that would be ok if at least Bauer had some knowledge of history. She mixes up certain historical facts with christian bible stories. The writing style is incoherent. First she describes supposedly a Nomad girl, so that children can imagine the prehistoric times, then Bauer abruptly moves into a Bible story, without any warning. What the hell? So, after all, it becomes full of Christian Mythology. What a waste. I bought 4 books before reading the reviews. I cant even offer them as gifts I am so ashamed of having these dumb books.."
1,Sadly disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. I am no scholar by any means but I cannot teach my children the personal beliefs of this woman. Which what makes up most of this book. She teaches bible stories as historical fact, and pushes her opinions as factual. I will be returning this workbook along with the text."
2,Defective cd,Our kids are enjoying the cd's but we received a defective cd (2nd cd track 15). I'm not looking forward to having to spend the time returning the cd's and getting new ones and so forth.
3,Not quite as good as expected,"I loved the ""classic"" jeans I had purchased before and wanted to try these (basically for a different color option). While they are quality jeans, I found the sizing was not the same as the ""classic"" fit. The waist is smaller. I can get them on, but the result is not pretty--belly fat overlaps the waistband. Perhaps it's because I don't understand the difference in the sizing descriptions from one type to the other, but that should be made clear in the description (that the fit is not the same even though they both purportedly have a ""natural waist""). I would have returned them, but decided they will be my ""incentive"" pants... the ones I will exercise and diet my way into."
1,Amanda cut.. you can have them ugh!,"I have bought Gloria Vanderbilt jeans for years, with no problem, then I bought the Amanda jean.. in my size.. after one wearing they stretched out two sizes, at the end of the day, I needed a belt on,..,they almost fell off of me.. do NOT like the amanda cut.. go back to classic cut please!"
5,Excellent service,"Excellent product, prompt shipping; jeans are slightly darker than I had anticipated, but I love them just the same!!"
1,One Side Anti-Religion Opinion,"If you enjoy harshly opinionated religion bashing, you will love this movie. If you enjoy well-thought out arguments and criticisms of religious organizations' promotional tactics you will be incredibly annoyed by the tone and approach of this ""documentary"" with starts of by clearly stating its opinion that all religion is stupid.So to make fun of people for promoting their beliefs through the selling of commercial goods, Carl Christman made a movie of his beliefs and sold it..."
1,Lacks Durability,I cannot comment on the performance of this plane. It broke immediately out of the box. It is way too fragile for most younger (and probably older) pilots. My eleven-year-old and eight-year-old sons were a couple of disappointed chaps that Christmas afternoon.
3,Not what I expected...,"At the time of my purchase, it was unclear of its size. But it was still nice and shipped smoothly."
5,EXCELLENT WORK GLOVES,"MASTER-GUARD GLOVES BY WEST CHESTER ARE OUTSTANDING WORK GLOVES. THEY ARE GRAIN GOATSKIN WITH LEATHER PALM AND VERY FLEXIBLE AND STRONG. BIGGEST PROBLEM IS OBTAINING THEM WHEN AVAILABLE - IN MEDIUM SIZE. I'M A STEEL FABRICATOR AND THESE GLOVES WORK VERY WELL WHETHER TORCH CUTTING,WELDING OR CONNECTING. PLEASE GET THESE BACK IN CIRCULATION SINCE THEY APPEAR TO BE UNOBTAINABLE IN STORES."
2,Just too much,"I wanted to get a new 2005 baby book with the most recent choices, but this book was just too much. It was more of a waste of time to get through all the ridiculous names then to just buy a smaller book. 50% of the book is just words pulled out of the dictionary, 25% is random groupings of letters, and 25% is actual names (both usual and unusual). I would not recommend this book, unless you really want to invest the time in sorting through every single type of bizarre name you can think of - and probably never would."
5,Crosman 760 pellet clips,"Bought a used Crosman 760 bb/177 pellet rifle. No clips to use pellets. Looked in many stores and had no luck. Looked on the web and found them on Amazon, cheap too! Brand new in the package!"
2,"Rick Steves Civita Day Pack, Navy","I would like to return this 'Day Pack'. We just returned from 2 weeks inEurope. The color, size, and pockets on the bag were fine. The main compartment's zipper did not work properly. It continually got stuck andmade getting into and out of the bag combursome. I also found that the 'Day Pack's' major compartment not having any bottom support wouldmake all of the items get jumbled together on one side. This made locating and pulling out items more difficult. I would not recommend thisproduct to anyone. I was disappointed in Rick Steves endorsing this bag as we have had good service with other Rick Steves travel items."
3,Akai PT4799 TV Stand Review,"The stand is the perfect match for the Akai PT4799 HDTV. Although there was NO evidence on the packaging containing the stand, both the top shelf (the element the TV rests on) and the bottem shelf (the base) had edge damage. It was in the rear on the top shelf and is concealed by carpeting on the base. The instructions and well aligned pre-defined screw holes facilitated an easy assembly. The pricing seemed fair. The strength appears to be sufficient providing the unit is not moved frequently."
3,Interesting but slow,"Mr. Capuzzo gives a thorough accounting of the shark attacks and he should be commended for his historical research of the era as well as the events. However, this is not for the easily bored reader. A good hundred pages of book must be read before the first attack occurs and much narrative follows the last one. In between, few of the individuals involved are defined well enough to make their characters memorable. Perhaps fast-paced thrillers have spoiled the reader's attention span but I believe restructuring this book would have improved it."
2,Close to Shore: Close to a great book,"This books' written words were mesmerizing. But the fact that photos and a decent map of the area are non-existant is INEXCUSABLE! Had one crappy, poorly detailed 100 year-old map of the area where the attacks took place, and that's it! Booooooo!!! Book would have been so much better if author had included photographs of not only the shark's victims, but others prominantly mentioned in the book as well. And 1916/present day photographs of Spring Lake, and Matawan creek (the scene of the shark attacks) would have been an obvious touch. Capuzzo, you are a lazy !$#! All the reseach you put into this book; how could you fall down on the job like this? Thankfully, some ambitious types have done your job for you on the internet. You can see what Spring Lake, Matawan Creek looked like in 1916 as well as today on Youtube. Close, but no cigar..........Such a waste for an otherwise splendid book......."
1,Disappointing,"I forced myself to read the first three chapters because I was so excited to get to the shark attack parts, but I haven't read one yet. I started to skip through the pages looking for anything about sharks...I haven't found it yet. So far it is a long drawn out book about nothing. No action, no plot & no sharks yet! I am not sure if I will ever open the book again, so I may never find out what happens in the end. At this point I don't really care. I am an avid book reader and this book is a big disappointment."
3,"Hard to hold attention, but lots of detail","I am a fan of shark stories and history as well. I purchased this book despite the mixed reviews. I have to agree with the reviews. The author obviously wants to set the tone and atmosphere of 1916 New Jersey. But, I would've prefered about 75 less pages to read to get to the first shark attack. The author is rambling on and on about all these historic details. I think it is overkill. I would've liked to see some pictures too. But, I guess that is what our imaginations are for. In the author's defense, he worked hard to research these details. I commend him for that."
3,"Works well, but not sturdy enough","Overall, the microphone is what it states--amplifies voice, echos, etc., but it is not very sturdy. After a few months the pieces started to break apart. One very annoying part is that if you move the microphone from room to room you have to hold it from the base, not the stick part because it doesn't screw in. It just pushes/pulls in and out. Not a very good design. I got tired of having to constantly push the stick back in every time my daughter was singing with it."
3,Boswellin,It is difficult to judge this produce. The weather is warmer and I am able to exercise...so I don't honestly kinow if the product is working or not...thanks
4,I found the instructions easy to follow and enjoyed learning,"Amazon and Klutz: We found the book to be easy to read and the instructions clear and easy to follow. My son enjoyed learning to juggle using the cubes sent with the book. However, within the first couple of hours of using the cubes, one busted a seam and spilled its contents onto the floor. This ended his learning experience, since then there were only two cubes."
5,nice gift,"My grandaughter was delighted that she got book and juggling balls. I got a big smile. Since she took it home, I can't add more."
5,Excellent explanation of complex querries,The authors offer simple explantions to complex concepts. They break it down nicely. I never though I could understand heavily nested querries and get a real handle on what is going on. I have a much more solid understanding of sql and am confident that I can get the info I need from my company's databases.Expect to spend a little time on some examples in order to allow concepts to sink in. I love this book.
3,A Good Read But...,"This is my second SQL book, and I selected it because it provides a lot of examples to work through. Generally it is well written, and I have referred to it often. This could be an outstanding book for novices IF the authors would provide simple examples and problems when they introduce a new topic. Too often however, they rush to include previous concepts which can inhibit comprehension of the new topic and present unnecessarily complex examples. I have had to consult other SQL books and resources to gain a clearer understanding of some of these topics.Also, I have found several instances in the exercises wherein the solution code appears to be incorrect - it does not generate the correct result set, such as producing 0 rows instead of 2, etc."
4,Cuts to the chase,This is a concise effort. Many programmers are thrown into SQL without ever having taken the time to learn the basics. And many are too proud to admit it :)This is an invaluable resource for programmers who need to come up to speed with SQL to expand their SQL capabilities within their own programming environment. It is indeed software independant - so the knowledge gained goes with you anywhere.I found 2 immediate benefits:1. Spend less time debugging your own or other people's SQL statements2. Let your database do more of the work (less coding in your own language) by learning how to correctly structure compound and complex SQL statements.Doesn't take long to read it. Time well spent.
4,Es ist wirklich geil!,"I was an exchange student last year in Dresden,Germany and that is where I found out about this group. 4:99 is not their best cd, but it is still hella good. If you are not sure about buying it you should even if you do not speak German!"
2,Tedious,"I really wanted to like this movie and after reading a few good reviews, I thought the rest were all haters. Ummm...no. This movie was awful. I forced myself to finish. S-L-O-W, plodding and predictable storyline. Semi-cute ending earned it 2 stars instead of 1. Honestly, I would avoid at all costs!!!"
4,Cant tell what everyone is talking about,What others call long and drawn out is something I found sort of sweet. The leads were great and the side characters were pretty good. The issue was pretty realistic as well. I think I might watch this movie again.
1,I Hate This Movie,"Sorry Nia Varddalos fans....I loved ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" but ""I Hate Valentine's Day"" does not remotely compare to ""..Greek.."". I'm wondering if Nia was also the cinematographer, I mean every other scene shows Nia's bewildered and amused expression and a remarkably glowy skin. The plot is stupid and predictable at every turn. This was just another waste of time, money and talent."
5,Amazing!!!!!,"The show is fantastic, there are not words to explain it's greatness. I recommend this, part 1, and all of the original series."
5,Best Anime Series out there!,Amazing conclusion to the Full Metal Alchemist storyline. Offered me a day's worth of entertainment. Fight sequences hard hitting and the story kept flowing at a steady pace without dragging at all.
5,The Most Fulfilling Anime Series You'll Watch,"It's very rare for an anime series to have a complete and fulfilling finale. This series outshines the majority of what is out there in depth, consistency, and true closure for characters and plot lines. This is a fine series and should be watched by many people. I am hoping that one day this series (I really only consider this anime series rather than the first since this one is manga canon) gets the recognition and publicity it deserves because it is excellent. I think it would make a great live action series for a major network like HBO or Showtime to persue. It's so powerful!"
2,the first review,"This dvd contains:the Batman 2-part season 1 finaleEpisodes included:The Rubberface of Comedy(part 1)The Clayface of Tragedy(part 2)In this season 1 two-parter finale, Joker turns Detective Ethan Bennett into Clayface!!!!!!!!!!NOTES:Clayface's ""the batam"" debut!!!(I Think)this dvd comes in a Walmart exclusive 2-pack(along with ""Batman Begins""the movie)"
2,Focus on dog grooming business,This book was informative however please note that it is very US focussed and will not be of great assistance with regards to regulations in other countries.The book did not provide an all round knowledgebase for setting up a dog walking business - mainly focussed on grooming.
3,home base pet care business,self help book in starting a pet business. I was hoping for a little more information
2,Very Disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!,I was very disappointed in the book. It looked like a used item. I bought it for a Christmas present but am unsure if I will give it because of the condition of the book. Too late to return and get something else.
1,Not as Great as it Looks,"I was excited to get this toy put together for my baby, thinking the sounds and colors would fascinate him but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. It took at least 15 minutes to install the doggone gym, and my baby doesn't even like it. The hanging toys are too high for a baby (lying down) to bat at, and the sound it makes is annoying."
1,Hated this toy!!!,"We hated this toy. We bought it for our daughter when she was 2 months old because she loved to kick her feet. She could not kick it hard enough to get the music to play, and spinning the toys rarely worked. She also seemed a little scared of this toy, and the music kind of sounds like some kind of psychotic circus music. Don't waste your money on this toy. We cannot even give it away now."
2,"Misconception, but can still be fun","This toy is a misconception when it comes to the kick activating deal, but I also think that the music is great for the baby. Yes, it can be annoying to us adults, but babies love that kind of thing. My son in 5 months old and loves watching the lights, but unfortunately the hanging toys are at his knees and it can be hard to activate the music again once it stops. What I do is just put the toy to the side of him and let him listen to the music and he sometime turns on his side to reach for the toys. Honestly the kicking part is useless because it pushes the whole toy back when he kicks it, but I kept it for musical purposes only. I probably wouldn't recommend this toy to anyone, but I'm stuck with it and have to do the best I can with the toy."
1,Who designed this??Never had kids?,"This toy was a complete disappointment. The advertising made it look like everything I was looking for, because my daughter has been kicking up a storm and loves to see things move when she kicks. So I thought, oh this will be perfect. But... it is ridiculous how hard you have to kick to get it to go off. AND... the stupidest part is that when you finally do get it to go off... the music plays for FIVE minutes. What kind of reinforcement is that??? Five minutes to an infant is an eternity, she falls asleep in 5 minutes. How about something more realistic like having the music play for 30 seconds or something like that and then they have to kick again to get it to go off. Overall, this toy was a joke. I took it back (after dissassembling 26 screws and trying to shove it back in the box. DON'T buy it. It stinks!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this when my son was about three months. We brought it home, assembled it, turned it on and it scared him to death! He is the happist baby ever and he couln't quit screaming. When we finally coaxed him into at least looking at it, he couldn't reach the spinning toys above his head and everytime he kicked at it, it just scooted back on the floor. Half the time the ""reward"" of lights and music didn't work so when you put it on constant play the music is so annoying and frightful none of us could tollerate it. Now he is 10 months and it is suppossed to be a ""sit-up"" toy but all it is at my house is a take-up-space, regret-spending-all-that-money toy. Don't make the same mistake I made!"
3,Not a bad addition to the toy chest!,"I bought this toy 2nd hand as I liked the ball features....it was unlike anything else my daughter had. 2 key things to your child enjoying it - 1. make sure it's on the right setting for their stage of development. Once they can sit up, it should be tilted backwards (press the red buttons on the legs) - that way you can rest the balls in the ferris wheel and watch them drop. 2. The thing is so LOUD it overstimulates too easily, so do what we did - put some masking tape over the speaker!!I think it's worth the $8 I paid for it 2nd hand, not sure if I would pay $35 for it.Audrey's Mom"
2,Disapointed,"This is the first thing I have bought without reading the customer reviews and I paid the price. If I had, I would have never wasted my money on it.The music is irritating and not pleasant at all. I guess the hint should have been in the word Carnival because that is what is sounds like. It wasn't hard to put up but my 2 month old hates. The kick pad doesn't work very well either.Perhaps it will be better when he can sit up but I doubt it will be in our house for that long."
2,Disappointment,"I think this will be a fun toy when my son is older, but it is useless now. I bought it for my 8-week old son because he loves to kick and I wanted to encourage it. The kick plate does not do anything unless you kick it so hard you shake the whole toy which then moves it out of reach. The hanging toys do activate it, but again you have to hit them hard enough to shake the whole toy. I think it is the actual shaking of the whole toy that is making anything happen. The biggest disppointment is that my son can't reach the toys. He is fairly long and the toys hang over his knees. The music is very loud and gets annoying fast. There are two settings -- one setting plays continuous, the other setting plays a song each time it is kicked or shook to activate it.The Fisher-Price Kick and Drive Gym is a much better choice. We got that one instead and he kicks it and makes it go like crazy. He really enjoys it."
1,HUGE WASTE!,"I bought this when my son was 3 months old and it was aweful. First of all it's design is just stupid! They can't kick it in the right place to make it play music or whatever annoying thing it does, and if they do happen to kick it, the thing just moves further away. My son is long and big (6 months-22lbs,30in)and he couldn't even reach the steering wheel part of it. I had it for one night then I took it back and bought the Baby Einstein gym."
2,Takes a lot for the music to play,"I bought this for my daughter when she was three months old for an Easter gift. I thought it would be great since it converts. I love toys that are going to last more than a couple of months. I wanted her to have something that would entertain her more than her bouncy seat since she seemed to be getting bored with it. Unfortunately, I have to sit with her the entire time she plays because I have to smack the toy when she kicks it in order to get it to play music. She does love this toy- she laughs when I bring it out, but I want something were I can fold laundry etc while she is playing. She is now almost five months old, and we are still having the same issues. I was very disappointed in this toy."
2,This toy is not worth the money,"I received this toy as a gift and was extrememly disappointed. It took a long time to put together because there were too many screws. I was disappointed with the quality. It was wobbly and didn't seem solid. In the sitting position, it doesn't seem like very much fun. The balls should do a lot more. After one day of play, the ferris wheel started sticking and clicking for some reason. I packed it back up and took it back to the store. I would highly recommend against it."
1,My son was not interested in this toy.,"I originally wanted the Classical Chorus Symphony but since that product was out of stock I thought I'd try this one. It was a huge waste of money. I laid my 3 month old son under it and he briefly looked at it and then looked away. The next time I tried to put him under it he cried and when I put him on his Baby Einstein floor gym he started smiling and playing.Once I got this product put together I realized the toys were too high for a baby to kick(and my son is a big boy), the lights are tilted up at an angle that baby can't see very well, and the music is very annoying.This toy will not collect dust at my house for I've already given it away...I hope this review was helpful!"
2,Doesn't hold interest,My son has had this toy since he was 1 month old. We've tried introducing it several different times. Everytime he will quickly loose interest and get cranky. The music is also quite loud. He is now 8 months old and this toy is collecting dust in the corner. Definatly not worth the high price.
4,My toddler LOVES it- but the baby?,"This thing is supposed to be a baby gym- but the baby finds it to be over-stimulating. It goes off any time you touch it, and you can set it for going off for a long time (setting 1) or for short bursts (setting 2). The music isn't too bad. Assembly was a breeze. But the baby hates it. HOWEVER- my two-year old LOVES this thing. It keeps his attention for HOURS. He loves to hit it and watch it, and is fascinated by the turning balls and lights. I'd HIGHLY recommend it for your toddler, on rainy days!"
2,I regret that I bought it,"I bought this when my son was 3 month old. I was hoping this toy can encourage him to kick and reach. There are several things I don't like about this product. 1. It is hard to assemble. And it kind of heavy. 2.Every time my baby kicks the board, the whole thing moves back. And the board is hard! 3. The hanging toys are at my babies knees. He cannot really kick it nor reach by hands. They are just useless. My son's height is at 50 percentile. So this problem is not because my son is too tall. I still use this toy mainly because I already bought it and put it together. I'm hoping the other feature will work better when my son can sit up. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Another Mom,"Once your baby is pulling up you might want to put this toy away, if they attempt to pull up on it they can tip it forward. My son went right over the front of it. Not the best buy in my opinion, but also not the worst. I got it when baby was 4 months and he enjoyed until about 8 months when I had to take it away."
5,outstanding book,"Already a classic, much quoted book, that all students in philosophy, cultural studies or modern art history should read."
4,The Business of Personal Training,Good reference for new and established personal trainers. Although photos give the book a dated feel the information is timeless and essential. Practical information about the business of personal training. I recommend to newbies and pros.
4,Very cute book,"Rarely would I call a book ""cute,"" but that is the word that comes to mind with this book. The plot was weak with gigantic holes in it. The flow of the story wasn't quite right. BUT you gotta love Gillian, Richard and his perky sisters! This author's great talent is clearly lively, fun dialogue. Gillian and Richard teased and taunted their way through the story in a very cute, endearing way. Not a great book, but I really LIKED it."
1,"Wow, that was bad","This revisionism belies the facts of HISTORY. How can we go forth in History when we are too busy revising this false and grand ""past""?... To hear the revisionists, Black and African blood is in every Accomplishment (but, hmmm, never in the historical disasters). If so, it seems that the African/ Blacks have been solely responsible for the dire straits that Blacks and Africans find themselves in TODAY. We are so busy rewriting the past, crying ""I am a VICTIM!"" in the present, and telling everyone (Europeans, Euro-Americans, Asians, Asian-Americans, Semitic, etc., etc.,) they ""OWE US"" for the future. Is it any wonder why we Africans appear at the lower stratas EVERY where else in the world, including Latin America, Europe, Asia, and including our own CONTINENT of Africa! yes, in Kenya, Uganda, etc., it is non-Africans who comprise the top stratas of society, from education, social, economic, etc..."
1,Oh please,"What struck me about this ""text"" was the blatant PC propaganda push by the author. Very little evidence is of any truth here. I do realize this author and his proponents have been thoroughly discredited however."
1,Listen to the TRUTH!,"Look through the pictures in this book : Life in Ancient Egypt"" by Adolf Erman, He has a picture of Scribes recording thepresence of "" NEGRO"" slaves in the book. This was a copy from one of the temple walls and clearly shows that Egyptians depicted Negroes and their features accurately !. I guess this upsets the Apple cart, but so what ? Negroes at that time were no different than they are now ; same hair, lips,etc...This means that the hieroglyphs would have depicted the priests, scribes and pharos with Nappy hair and other negro features, which they do not.Guess they will have to look for another Group to cook up an identity.Even if you told the negro that he invented everything , it still would not change their own perceptions of themselves because deep down, they know it is just a lie. Why cant the Negro just be who they are ? There is no shame in that is there ?"
1,False Hypothesis,"Ancient Egyptians during the dynastic period saw themselves as Egyptians. Their art and literature pointedly reveals that they showed no identification with either Africa or Asia. However, Mr. Doipe believed otherwise. The book is full of hypotheses and references that are either false of fictitious."
3,When it works it works well,"This machine is a great alternative to having your carpets professionally cleaned. However dont expect it work next time you bring it up from the basement.Search the internet and this is what you will find. The unit stops spraying at both the floor and thru the wand. Everyone I read stated the same thing over and over. There were a lot of ""fixes"" but so far none of them have fixed mine. I have even gone so far as to buy a used one online for 40$ and take parts from it. Still no spray. Cleaned out all the tubing, water heater, spray ends, swapped out the pump and soap mixer thing. Cleaned all the seals, even replaced some. still no spray. I dont get it.I will go buy another one however but I think Im going to stick with a used one cause the odds are not in your favor by spending more on a new one.Good luck"
3,Has no hint,I was use to doing these puzzles in the newspaper. The newspaper puzzle always gives you one hint. Like h equals e. This book doesn't give you a hint.
4,3rd book for my husband for xmas,he loves these books .as reported before it's a real chore finding these game books for him.he's 74 years old and refuses to do anything digital (boring!!) but the kids and i try to find something that he just needs a pencil for.would love to give a 5 star but i still think it takes to long for shipment.
4,works OK,Product very well constructed. Have other belts without magnets. Still unsure as to the effect of magnets?!?! But the cold pack works great
5,Great product,Was wanted a new backbelt this one gives better support. I love that comes with pack that can be in freezer or heated.
2,Too messy!,"I bought Harrah my large dog some of this 2 years ago, and of course it smells SO GOOD, but it is just too messy.Most of the ""bar"" has been turned into powder from it being so brittle. So you get maybe 1/4 of the ""ice cream bar"" intact while the rest just sits on the bottom.I do not mind my Harrah having fun while eating a treat but even she was turned off trying to figure out where the ""powder"" went. (Since its freeze dried, unless you get a sizeable chunk the minute the powder is wettened by her nose or tongue its ""melted"") This just confused her and she ended up leaving the powder and small pieces alone.But if youre lucky and can get a pretty entact bar, I'd say give it a try. She seemed to like the sweetness."
3,"Great fun, but ditto on the stickers","I chuckled reading about the stickers. I'm glad my son is not the only one who has a horse with no stickers around the nose. I put them on wrong and when I tried to pull them off. Oh well. We bought this for his 1st birthday and he loved the music right away. Now, at 16-months, he's figured out how to get off, but not on yet. He rides it for 3 full sets of music. It entertains him well."
1,not much fun for a bit tall kids,I bought this toy for my baby when she is 11 months.she sat on it for hardly five minutes even the first time also.she is a bit tall and her legs touch the floor and she is standing without sitting on it.but she enjoys the music but not sitting on it.she is 12 months now and she is not ready to sit on it anymore.
4,A little disappointed,"Although the butterfly clock was beautiful, I was a little disappointed that it did not have the second hand on it, as pictured in both the Amazon ad and on the box it came in. I reordered it, and the second clock was the same as the first. I returned one of them with postage paid by the seller. I'm satisfied."
2,Cute until it broke,"We bought this clock for Christmas and enjoyed it, even though it has a loud tick-tock sound. After my daughter complained that it was keeping her awake, we moved it from her bedroom to the playroom. That worked out fine until I needed to change the battery. While the back cover was off to replace the battery I bumped the round dials, knocking something loose. We have tried to put it back together but it still doesn't work. So, it was cute for 7 months - but a waste of money.Be careful to not touch the clock's inside parts while changing the battery."
1,Disappointed with clock,The picture looked better than the product. This was not a quality product and the clock fell once so it does not even work now. The lesson I've learned is that I should go with a reputable company that I know even though the price may be higher.
4,Great but difficult to read.,This is a book where very simple concepts are explained using the most difficult to read English you can imagine. You will need to re-read every sentence at least twice. Every time I get done reading about certain pattern and understand what the author is trying to explain I wonder why it was explained using such arcane sentences.Other than that it's a great book for anyone who is designing large apps and is looking for organization and design efficiency.I disagree with a reviewer who said that patterns are not applicable to web-based apps. I see a lot of uses that I am going to utilize in the coming projects.
5,IT Team Loved it,I bought this book based on a recommendation from a friend for my IT group. They read the book in a week and talked about it and its concepts for ever! I think it was a positive impact on my group.
5,All programmers should read this book,"Design PatternsThis book is a classic computer science text. This is probably the one computer book that every computer programmer and software developer should read. It will definately have an immediate impact on the code you write. Unlike most computer books, which have a shelf measured in months, this book has lasted the test of time, and will likely be relavent for many years. (At least as long as object-oriented programming languages are used!)This book uses C++ and Smalltalk to code the examples, but don't worry about that. There are plenty of books that are basically ""rewrites"" of this book using Java or other langauges, but it doesn't matter what language your programming. I recommend this book over any other patterns book because these guys invented the subject. The patters can be programmed in any language, and you don't have to be a C++ or Smalltalk expert to understand them."
5,Good introduction to the patterns topic,"Definitely a must-have classic book. It is well written and systematically structured. Every pattern is thorougly commented and an example (mostly in C++) is included. The book is held in an easy-to-understand langauge and is strongly advisable not only for architect-beginners, but also for programmers as well as experienced analysts."
3,A seminal work in the field,"This book started (follows?) a revolution in software design and is a must read for that reason. However, I'm not sure the additional levels of abstraction they advocate in the introduction (and that motivate the use of many of these patterns) really leads to more robust and maintainable code."
4,An excellent complement to the book of the same name.,"This CD should not be considered a replacement for the book, at least as long as you are like me and like the portability of a book, it's ability to record notes, etc.What John Vlissides and the folks at AWL have done very well is re-shaping the book to electronic form. This is not just a duplication of the book, but a genuine adaptation of the content to a different medium, in this case HTML. Perhaps most valuable for me is the ability to pop this in and do a full-text search. I still use the paper book, though.It would have rated 5 stars but for one thing: the inability to record notes within the medium. That's not the fault of the publisher or anyone--it's a difficult technical problem that hopefully someone will solve.I would heartily recommend this to consultants or anybody who doesn't necessarily have a ""home base"" because these are much easier to lug through airports than the hardcover GoF book. :-)"
3,Only if you know C,"The book is good if you know C. I only know Java....therefore, the examples were of no use. I found this to be very frustraiting. I really don't konw why it got such a high rating. I bought it for that reason and I wisht that I would have saved my money. If you don't know C, I would not recommend this book."
1,I hope nobody is still reading this book,This book is way out of date by now. Singleton for an example has been a clear antipattern for years now. The rest of them are poorly explained or more complexity than they're worth. Overall the concepts of this book are workarounds for the short comings of strict OOP. Avoid over-complicated inheritance hierarchies and this book is pretty much unnecessary.
3,Design Patterns CD - Needs updating,"The CD version is not 100% compatible with current browsers. Internet Explorer v6 reports errors on every page and it's new security features disable some CD functionality.The Java search engine does not function in both IE and Firefox.The content is, of course, exceptional; but the reasons for buying the CD are lost in the new browsers. Stick with the book."
4,"""Head First Design Patterns"" is a much better introduction","Nobody is going to take away GoF's mantle, but is the 1995 book still the best available reference on, or introduction to, the subject? Tentative ""yes"" on the former, emphatic ""no"" on the latter. One will be better off by consulting ""Head First Design Patterns"", and not lose that much by stopping there."
2,poor explanation though important topics,"thought it addresses an important topic, but neither the explanation nor the examples make it a good book. I just cannot find another book."
2,Not worth the money!,"I was really disappointed with this product. For one thing, the keyboard does not plug into the computer or interact with the software at all. You can buy the software separately, which I would recommend, because this keyboard is not worth $80.00. It had mid-sized keys which are small. My next complaint is that the software only teaches rhythm and what the notes on the piano are. It does not teach a child how to read sheet music. My daughter (6 yrs old) got through the whole software CD in less than 2 hrs. She still can't read sheet music or play songs. She learned a small amount of music theory, which, I could have taught her for free. Finally, they say there is another CD that is Level 2, which there isn't. I have scoured the internet trying to find the next level and it appears not to have been released. So now I am not sure what to do. Way too expensive at $120.00. Not worth the money."
4,"Great history, bad graphics","I'm a fan of the anime series, and I buy this game for that. The history in the game is awesome, but the graphics engine and the movements of the characters are to clumsy. My recomandation, if you are a fan of the series, buy it, otherwise, think it twice."
3,Ok if you really want gameplay,"This item was basically just rounding out my boyfriend's obsessive collection of GITS items. :) He was happy with it and played a bit but its difficult and theres a steep learning curve, can be very frustrating. He's happy to have it though."
3,Barry has Written Better,"This is one of Barry's books where he includes a lot of personal stories and like in other novels where he does this, the overall quality, entertainment and humour doesn't quite reach the high benchmark of his usual work where he just comments on the world. This book should really be called Dave Barry relives his life in the 60's and early 70's as that pretty much is all that's in this book. Even though when turning 50 Barry obviously lived must have lived through the 80's and 90's there is no commentary what so ever on these decades so if you weren't alive back in the 60's and 70's then obviously you are not going to enjoy the reminiscing factor.An interesting look at America in the 60's and 70's but if you weren't alive back then I'd suggest better Barry non fiction books such as Boogers are My Beat and Homes and Other Black Holes. Also read Barry's fiction masterpiece Tricky Business."
3,Mr. Barry is a silly writer,"Mr. Barry is a silly writer. He is good at it, though he can get a bit repetitive. In this book he goes through some of his personal and United States history, and goes into the various aspects of growing old that most people associate with turning fifty (50). He is hilarious. I find his humor gets trite at times, but I also find myself chuckling at what he writes."
2,Disapointed in this book,I had to push my self though this book. I kept telling myself to give it a few more pages and it would get better. Well it never did. :( This will not be read again by me. I wouldn't recommend it any one I know.
1,A Soviet Union work that has been recycled.,"I bought the book and subsequently (almost within minutes, because there is not much there, just one map and a few childish overlays) returned it. This ""atlas"" has all the look of similar geographical works, probably for schools, published in the former Soviet Union. I think it probably is one of these, and some clever intermediary has uncovered it and tried to dress it up a bit, and sell it for many times its cost. Most of the weight (worth) is in the packaging. The map content is of little or no value. It's shoddy workmanship. To repeat, I'm sure it's recycled, dressed-up for the American consumer, materials from a middle school classroom of the former Soviet Union. Caveat emptor!"
4,Earn your turns in hi-def,"If you're a telemark skier, or just a back country skier in general you will appreciate this film. Its soundtrack is good (not too much rap) and the images are vivid thanks to high definition recording. Overall the story line sticks to skiing and not too much verbage -- who wants to talk about skiing, let's just see some! Besides, unless you're Warren Miller, skiers in general do not make the greatest commentators. Fortunately Flakes sticks to what a good ski flick is about; the action and music."
1,Nice but very unsafe design,"I must agree that the set is very cute and this is what made us keepping it even with doubts about its design and quality. After just a few days of using it, my 2.5 years old leaned backward and broke the back of the chair. She is only 25 lb and did not do anything that the child of this age does when is sitting in the chair. I find this set is very unsafe and will not recommend to anyone."
3,Not that awesome,"This topper was not comfortable and heats up like mad rendering the whole experience much less comfortable in summer. It does not completely cover a regular full size mattress. All in all, I would not recommend it."
3,makes puddles on my deck,"I bought this fan from Lowe's for 79.99. It is great for keeping cool under my gazebo, but when I hooked up the mister, it chased us all away! The furniture was damp within seconds, and puddles formed on my deck. I would recommend this product, it works great as a regular fan, but don't use the mister unless you are in your swim suit!"
2,Don't expect to get parts,"We purchased two of these fans to use on the patio of our summer home. The first time we used them someone tripped on the misting hose (even though I thought I was careful to keep them out of the way) and broke all the plastic snaps that holds the misting kit to the fan. I called Holmes customer service and was told they had no replacement misting kits for the fan and had no idea when any might be available. It seems very poor service to not have in stock a part that obviously breaks easily and at a time of heavy use. I tried bonding glue and that did not work. My next repair approach will be to try to secure it to the fan with fishing line or dental floss. Also, you really cannot use the fan wearing normal clothes unless you are prepared to get wet."
4,Fan with misting,"I use this without misting feature, a little messy on my screened in patio.But....it is good out around the pool on hot days with the misting feature."
2,Poor quality,"I bought with with high hopes for a great product for my daughter who LOVES George. I was let down. He's cute and he's a nice size, but his flimsy stuffing was sticking out all over. I pulled the little pieces out and then squeezed it like my daughter would. It started coming out again. Very disappointing. His mouth is also one piece only lightly sewn down in the middle and was already coming off when I took it out of the bag. Also very disappointing. I'll return it hope to find a better quality product. I suggest you skip this and keep looking."
2,Looks better in the picture,The doll was not what I expected. It looks better in the picture. It feels like the type of dolls you win at the carnival.
1,Curious George Large Plush Doll,"Very poor quality. I should have listened closer to the reviews. Understuffed, poorly sewn, a small hole in the red shirt. Material not real durable. I can sew so I opened him up and restuffed him. I sewed heavier thread on the feet, hands and mouth so the thread would not come loose as stated in other reviews. He looks better.I choose to rework him rather than send him back."
2,Vintage clothespins are better,"I have been line drying since this past spring. I wanted wood clothespins as I'm trying to avoid plastic whenever I can. I started with cheap ones from a big box store. They were small and weak, so I looked around for something better and found these. Based on the reviews, I ordered them. They were a bit bigger and stronger than what I had, but they fell apart so easily, I was losing a couple a week. Sure, I could put them back together, but they were even less likely to stay together after that. Finally, I found some vintage clothespins and ordered those. The old clothespins are made of hard wood and have strong springs. If you can find them, that's what I recommend."
5,Silly me.,I purchased a canvas clothespin bag and these wooden clothespins. Neither of which are necessary with the air dryers I have purchased. I may not need the clothespins now but they are good quality and maybe useful later on.
1,Poor writing,"I have read 21 Orson Scott Card books, so I can safely say that I am a big fan. This book lacks a lot of the elements that his other books have. For example, in most of his books the characters have many ethical dilemmas they must overcome. This book has very little of that, and we can only see it in the main character. Another flaw is the dialogue, which sounds forced. many of the little jokes characters make are not really funny or interesting. Other complaints:- the fist quarter of the book could have been condenced into two or three pages.- all of the characters are one dimensional. I cared about none of them.- the progression of the plot was messy and difficult to follow, which makes the twists seem less potent.If you want to read a good OSC book, try Lovelock or books from any of his series."
3,"Fast-paced, but not much else","This is a one-time read. I checked it out for an end-of-the-semester I-actually-have-time-to-read-something-for-fun novel, and I wasn't dissapointed. It was fast-paced and engaging with interesitng characters and a lot of plot twists; not a Card classic, but still a fun book. Although it doesn't come near ""Speaker for the Dead"" or ""Red Prophet,"" which are my favorites of Card's novels, it doesn't feel like it's trying, so it's still genuine."
3,Card is bored with Sci-Fi,"As of late, one can tell that Orson Scott Card is tired ofwriting science fiction. This brings great regret to me,as his method of writing, story telling, and general styleare excellent for the science fiction section. This book isnot for those who ""treasure"" his science fiction works, but none the less, it is a good read."
4,Family Reading for Christmas,"Make some hot chocolate, turn on the tree, gather the kiddies and enjoy this delightful story by Jan Karon. It's a perfect read for Christmas, and sure to become a classic. We're not just talking about Mitford. We're talking about Mitford at CHRISTMAS. Accept this little book for what it is...a delightful Christmas tale designed to bring a smile to your little one's face as well as a feeling of nostalgia for small town living. Pack it away carefully with your ornaments and Christmas angel so that you and your family can enjoy a fireside reading year after year."
4,Give Jan Karon a Break!,"I agree with Calyndula; this is a cute little book - a perfect holiday gift with wonderful, warm illustrations worthy of Mitford itself. Perhaps some of the early reviewers were expecting another novel from JK, but this is a very nicely done ""franchise extension."" Sometimes buying a book without the opportunity to ""thumb through"" results in surprises - maybe even disappointment, but one shouldn't blame the author. The Hallmark snowmen apparently were as big a hit as the book (NYT best-sellers for weeks), because the snowmen were certainly hard to find in stock."
5,Loved the Mitford story.,"I love all of the characters in the Mitford series. This one is very short, but the story was good."
1,peachy,Would not recommend.I will stick to oil of olay. This product is very greasy & smells bad. I think it would clog your pores.
4,Great Stylus for the ipad,"This is the only stylus I have used for the ipad, but I am almost completely satisfied with it!The only thing I wish it had were a cover or retractable tip. Other than that, it has been perfect. With this stylus and my ipad I have replaced my yellow pad at work!"
3,BETTER THAN POGO,"I purchased the stylus to work with the iPad, I researched a lot before buying. I tried the Pogo and it seemed you had to press harder with the Pogo and the size and width of the boxwave is a little better. Not perfect like a real pen but better then others. SOMEONE PLEASE MAKE A PEN SIZED STYLUS FOR iPAD!!! Now there is handwriting recognition app WOO HOO!!!"
4,Stylus,This is work item is not worth the purchase for the iPad. It is just a metal tube with conductive foam. Even a cold finger works as well.I have now revised this for the Kindle Touch and it works great and is very much worth th purchase.
3,Fine if you're a Pigmy...Too short for large hands.,"Nothing really wrong with the quality and functionality but way to short for a large handed person. Remember leaving all of your freshly sharpened number 2 pencils at home on test day and having to scrounge around for a pencil at school and only finding a short stub? Well now you know how I felt when this thing arrived and I tried to use it. It is way to short for my big hand, otherwise it is fine for your kindergardener."
2,Does not work on HP touch screen lap top computer,"Purchased for use with a new HP touch screen lap top computer and it does not work on it. Maybe it is not supposed to work on it, but I could not get a reply from the manufacturer about it, so it get's 2 stars for not working properly AND the manufacturer not helping me figure out why."
3,Good While It Lasted,Bought this stylus at the beginning of the year and unfortunately it stopped working so well after about 6 months of use. When it was new I used this stylus constantly for working on my iPad. It worked beautifully and solved the problem with all the fingerprints on the screen. This leaves me wishing that the stylus still worked and thinking about test driving a different brand.
1,Too Small,Remember when you were a kid and you tried to use the end of a pencil after it had been sharpened down to far? That's how it feels to use this stylus. Why wouldn't the designers make this the standard size of a pen? It feels unnatural in your hand as it is just too small.
2,Not durable,"We've had it for over a year now. It worked well for a while. My husband also got several other cheap ones from eBay just so we have one everywhere in the house. I didn't really compare boxwave and the cheap ones until today I had trouble using it. I thought it was something wrong with my iPad. Then I switched to the cheap one and found a BIG difference. The boxwave couldnt scroll the screen 3 out of 5times while the other one had no problem at all. So dissapointed with its quality, not to mention it's pricy!"
2,You can do better.,"This stylus isn't bad for the price, I guess.The headphone connection adapter wears out quickly.I'm not very fond of rubber-type material styluses in general at this point. I've found that they are prone to tearing and generally do not last longer than a few weeks - unless you are extremely careful. Maybe I'm just hard on things.I recommend theNew Trent IMP63B Stylus/Styli Touch Screen Cell phone Tablet Pen with Micro-Knit Technology Capacitive Stylus for iPhone 4 4s iPod touch iPad 2 Samsung Galaxy Motorola Xoom Blackberry Playbook, Barnes and Noble Nook (Black Color). Not only is the head of the stylus made of a unique micro-fiber knit capacative material, but the entire stylus head is retractable, maximizing protection and extending the life of the product. Buy this or something like it...."
4,Above average,"Works great with my iPad and feels great in my hand. No complaints, but it might take a while to get use to."
1,disappointed,"Was thrilled to receive an Ipad from my kids for Mother's Day but realized my fingers are way too clumsy to move as fast as needed, so I ordered the stylus along with an Incase. It's barely a month and the tip of the stylus is already off. Sorry I didn't order other brand stylus's that were 3 for $1.00 rather than the $8.00 I paid for this one."
5,Great product. Great price.,"This works very well, and I love the attachment with the spring that will let me use it while it's attached to my Nexus 7. Quick shipping to Canada at a very reasonable price direct from Boxwave. No complaints here at all."
2,Tip won't stay on,Worked fine for a couple weeks then the black rubber tip fell off and rendered the instrument worthless. No way to get the tip back on due to the way it is constructed.
1,Don't waste your time if you want to use it to take notes - Grade = D,"The device is fine for button pushing and not bad for drawing however if you want to take handwritten notes with ipad apps like Note Taker HD, newNotes, WritePad, Penultimate or the others I tried, don't waste your time.The problems are -1. The round ""nub"" you touch the pad with is huge and not very accurate for handwriting. A somewhat pointed tip would be better.2. It is not very responsive with the device. It works best when you move slow and have as much of the ""nub"" touching the screen is possible.Its a very blunt and inaccurate tool that is not very good for taking handwritten notes on the ipad."
5,A stylus that works!,"The BoxWave is a basic stylus, but it works great with an iPad. I've been using it for a week to take notes during meetings using the NoteTaker HD app, and am starting to use it with WritePad (which actually can recognize my chicken scratch quality handwriting). If you are looking for a stylus that makes your iPad work like a paper notebook, this is definitely an option I recommend you consider."
3,decent,"I paid $8 for this online. I have used it to take notes on my iPad in class for a few weeks now. My only complaint is that the soft, kind of matte appearance of the tip has started to wear off and the smooth rubber sticks to the screen. This is a little annoying. I also have doubts as to how much longer the stylus will last. For $8 it should last at least as long as the $2 G2s I used to take notes with. That said, it's not dead yet so I'll give it three stars."
4,Just what I wanted,"This stylus is great for everything I do on my iPad. I bought this stylus so that I could take notes in class. The only complaint I have is that my notes have to be bigger than I normally would write because of the large rubber tip, compared to a pencil. I use this stylus for almost everything on my iPad, other than typing. I recommend this for all users!"
5,Great stylus!,"This is a great stylus for the iPad! Works great, doesn't feel cheap at all, very smooth. Would definitely recommend this pen."
3,"IDENTICAL to Acase stylus, but more expensive","Just FYI, this stylus is *identical* to the one that Acase sells on Amazon, but Boxwave charges 50% more. I ordered them both and they are exactly the same."
3,iPad stylus,"I don't believe that this product carries a value close to it's price. I'm afraid that the tip used on the iPad will wear out or disintegrate and, therefore, I do not use it like I normally would. The concept is great, however."
2,Same as the Acase,"I bought this after being disappointed with the Acase for lack of accuracy during note taking. But I had the opportunity to have both products side by side. They are EXACTLY the same thing. I could not find a SINGLE difference. Which leads me to conclude that they are both coming out of the same manufacturing plant in China and then just labeled and repackaged and distributed. So who cares? Well the AcaseAcase Capacitive Stylus for Apple iPad 16GB, 32GB, 64GB WiFi + 3G, iPad 2, iPhone, iPod, Motorola Xoom, Samsung Galaxy, BlackBerry Playbook (Jet Black)is $5 cheaper. So I ended up keeping the Acase assuming that a note-taking-stylus is yet to be made. In the mean time this works for keeping my screen clean."
3,"Overpriced, but more accurate than using your finger!","This little stylus does it's job pretty well. I'd prefer if it was a little smaller, so as to be more precise. Still, it's 100% better than trying to touch tiny things on the iPad with a finger (and I have tiny fingers!). I still hate my iPad (it was a gift, and I'm not a gamer so I find it fairly useless except for occasional Web browsing [which is extremely quirky and unreliable]) but I don't hate it quite as much with this stylus. :)"
4,bought for my husband,"my husband didn't want to write a review, but he says it does exactly what he wanted it to do. he uses it to draw with his ipad. the only thing he said he would change on it is: he wishes writing tip was a little smaller to do the detail drawing. otherwise he loves it."
3,not quite there yet,"I'm mostly using this on an Android phone running autosketch. Over all, this stylus is pretty good when compared to other styluses on the market, but it isn't much better than simply using my pinky finger. I've messed around with it for drawing and stuff, but find the finger more available and just as precise. Women and youngsters, having smaller fingers than mine, will be even more precise.I may be a bit too demanding though. I was envisioning something like a wacom tablet with that precise little pen with the controls and stuff that allow you to almost airbrush. Basically, I need a button to turn the drawing function on and off. Any other controls for circle radius and stuff are icing on the cake, but I really do need that button. It's my preferred style.Gotta keep trying - maybe that preferred technique will change."
5,A Nice Stylus...,"I got this stylus to use with an Archos A7o internet tablet.My main reason for getting it was because on the Archos, sometimes links when browsing the net (especially on news sites) are small enough and close enough together that I was hitting the incorrect one quite often. Mainly, I'd be trying to get one, and accidentally get the one above or below my intended target.This stylus seems to fix that issue. I'm still using my fingers as my primary means of navigating the tablet, but when I'm on certain sites I grab the stylus and it's accuracy is quite a bit better for those tight squeezes.The design of the stylus is great. It looks good, fells nice in the hand, and seems to be made extremely well. I really like the color of it.Overall, I think it's a great product for a pretty good price."
2,Lasted Three Months,It works well but is not very durable. After three months the stylus tip disintegrated. I purchased a different stylus. Hopefully that one will last longer.
4,"Super sensitive nib, very smooth writing.","ONLY downside to this great stylus is the size of the nib. It's ""fat"". But it writes well on the iPad 3, very smooth and responsive, no lag between write and having it appear on screen in my notebook app. I've tried 8 different styli from different companies and this one is the most responsive. I just wish it came in a ""fine point"" version."
2,Sticks to iPad screen after a while,"I really liked this stylus when I got it, and for about the first three months. It worked beautifully when writing on my iPad. Then it began to stick to the glass, and became virtually unusable for writing with. I contacted BoxWave, and their customer service person suggested cleaning it with warm water and mild detergent. Did that, but still sticks. I think I should get more than three month's use out of a writing instrument that cost over $20."
2,Didn't last long,"I was erasing on an app today and the rubber top came off the stylus. Try as I have, I can't get it back on so I just ordered another one from a different company. I hope I have better luck with this one!"
3,"Ok, not great","The pen does what it's intended to do. But, I have two complaints. First, it is just too small. It doesn't fit in your hand very well. Second, it is like writing with a very, very dull pencil. The ""stylus"", tip, is way too big and you can't see what you are writing on the pad. I wish it had two stylus sizes, one large and one small. Really, this thing should allow me to go and precisely position the cursor on a document, but, it is too big for that.This is the first stylus I have used so I have no basis for comparison.It is ok but not great.Bob"
1,"Not all touchscreens are created equal, apparently",Length:: 3:03 MinsI love my Nook Color. This stylus doesn't work on it.
4,Works fine,"I use this stylus with iAnnotate and it moves well over the surface of the iPad. What else is it supposed to do? Yes, it also seems to remove smudges, but won't it accumulate dirt? Too soon to tell."
4,Good stylus,"This stylus is quite unique. Instead of a rubber nub or a foamy nub, this stylus has a metal mesh nub. Now I wouldn't recommend it for writing ,though it serves its purpose, but I do recommend it for drawing and painting. If you have a screen protector on your tablet you have to draw or write with a little more pressure. The stylus is very durable though and it comes with chains so you can attach to your tablet or belt buckle.ProsGood weightNub is durableDifferent chains to attach then stylus to your mobile deviceGood response timeExcellent for artistsConsNot really compatible with screen protectors ( well with my device anyways)No grip"
1,Great Product - Horrible Durability!!,I purchased product in October and I really loved how well it works but its now Feb. and I noticed the metal band by the tip comes off and is stripping the fiber tip.Overall very disappointed in the quality of the product. I have had bamboo & Targus since iPad 2 release and still holding up.
2,"Too thick, would use a finger instead.","The stylus is too thick to be used. On top of that, you need to press really hard on the screen for it to be effective. Using a finger might be more efficient. I bought it thinking that this would allow me to take notes on my new Ipad but the thickness and the fact that you need to press really hard on the screen defeats the purpose. You cannot use it as a pen."
3,Smaller than I expected,"I was expecting something just a little bigger than what showed up in the box. It's not terriby comfortable, but it gets the job done. I'd still rather have something that felt a little more natural in my hand. Not at all worth the $15 I paid for it. For what's in this, it's not worth more than $5."
2,Almost useless on Sprint HTC hero,"I bought this for my wife as she was ready to smash the phone out of frustration for lack of responsiveness and pretty bad accuracy when input data. I told her to cut fingernail and use only very tip, having fancy nails makes ladies feel more feminine I guess, so she refused.So she tried this mega expensive device and rubber tip fall off almost day one.We both experience lack of accuracy and responsiveness.In my experience, it was just a waist of time and money.To be fair, HTC hero has smaller screen than average Android devices, and Sprint/HTC will not provide Android 2.2 Froyo to htc hero wich includes numerous improvements on the issue.Her solution: Now she went fancy and got herself a Samsung 4G and no more need for this device.Another option but a risky one is trying to install a custom rom with updated Android OS to froyo.there's also a diy solution: cheaper, don't know if better:instructables(dot)com/id/Cheap-Ipod-Pogo-Stylus-not-aluminum-foil/"
3,Stylus Lifetime,"I bought the boxwave because it is the best stylus out there for the iPad. However, after several months of fairly heavy use (using note-taking apps), the tip seems to have worn out. It no longer glides across the surface easily. Someone on the interwebs suggested that it needs a little lubrication by rubbing it on your (or someone's) greasy forehead. While it works for a minute or so, it's not really a long term solution (not to mention it's kinda gross).I suppose that it's not surprising that it wore out considering that the tip is so soft. Still, the price is a tad high for something I will need to regularly replace.I also wish that it had a sharper and more precise tip. I also use a tablet PC, and those styli are really responsive in comparison. I know, I know, it's a different technology. I'm just wishing here..."
2,Worked great for 1 week...,"I ordered this stylus based on the reviews. It worked as well as everyone stated. Could be a little longer, but overall, it provides for a nice writing/sketching experience on my iPad. After about week of gentle use, the rubber tip fell off. The stylus is not designed to have the tip be replaced, so it can't be fixed. Waste of money.So... I loved how it worked before it became useless. My expectation was that it would last longer than a week. I wish that I had saved my packaging & receipt so that I could send it back. I'm ordering a Griffin now."
3,About as expected,"Got an iPad2 for work and needed a stylus to use for note taking. It seems to work fine. I'd like something with a smaller point (haven't found anything) to make writing easier. Connection to the ipad audio jack works, but after some use, it's a little loose though I haven't lost the stylus yet. I've tried others and this one works as well as any."
3,Works fine but it's too light,"The pen writes just fine, but it's just too short and lightweight to feel right. it's like writing with a toothpick."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I have purchased 2 of these stylus in the past year, both of them ripped on the tip by regular usage. I tried to get the manufacturer to replace the item but was told that the item is out of warranty. Never once acknowledging the poor workmanship in the design of the stylus. This is a definite buyer beware item and for a person who has purchased 2 since this past March I would not suggest purchasing this item. In the end I'm just fortunate that I didn't damage my iPad."
1,Caution!,"I bought the black and red boxwave stylus. $10 was wasted, using a number 2 pencil eraser would have been better! The stylus has no weight to it, the rubber tip is coming apart after 3 days just tapping the iPad 3 screen, no writing or sliding movements used. There are 3 parts to this stylus, the metal top with the plastic audio jack, the hollow body, and the head which is held together with a dab of glue to the body cavity. I was expecting something more for $7 but this stylus should have been $1 or less. Santa Monica's video review is spot on. Use your fingers or spend $20+ on an actual stylus!"
4,Great iPad tool - needs fixing,"I ordered this stylus for my iPad. It worked great! I really liked it.....until the capacitive head popped off after about a month of use. I used it everyday, but for probably less than 20 minutes per day. The head came off and while I can push it back on, it doesn't stay on. The stylus has become useless. I originally thought that $15 was a litle steep. Then after using it for the first month I thought it was worth it's value. Then the head came off and I really can't use it anymore. I have not called Boxwave but I need to."
4,good product,"This is my first stylus, so it's hard to say if it's great or good or bad. I'll just describe what the fact is.The response to touch is quick, good for clicking, but hard to scroll. when you want to scroll screen, mostly it become click.oh, it's also maybe I need more practice to accommodate it.The second is the tip has different sensitive in different angles. a little annoy but it's ok."
3,Works fine...however....,"I purchased one of these to takes notes, doodle, etc....I just wished they could design these with a finer point. The stylus works fine...however, the clip broke in 2 weeks...it has a sharp bend in the clip that makes it prone to failure. A spring doesn't have sharp bends! so they don't break....I hope this is helpful"
3,"Works okay, but there are cheaper generic versions that work equally as well","The product isn't bad. It's definitely not good with detail work, but that's to be expected. I use it primarily for giving lectures and writing notes, and it does a decent job with text and simple figures. But I'm unimpressed with the price. I have some generic styli that I use that work just as well as this one, but they were MUCH cheaper. Bottom line: cheaper versions work just as well; if you're looking to spend more money, find a better stylus than this one."
2,slow service,we urgently need the product and paid 2 day air shipping. The order was placed on 1/30 and we didn't receive until 2/4. The quality of the pen is so so. It copies the same design of many other pens. no creativity at all.
5,Excellent iPad stylus,"I previously used the Pogo Sketch and, despite the item only being satisfactory, I used it for about a year. I thought that was the best a stylus for the iPad could be. Upon receiving the BoxWave stylus, I cannot believe how much easier, legible, and comfortable the results are when using this stylus. I recommend this product to all iPad users. Spending $15 on this stylus greatly improves the functionality of the $500 + iPad to the point where it is a must-have for all users wishing to take handwritten notes. Also try NoteTaker HD and Penultimate for the iPad - great apps.I thought I'd use the Pogo Sketch as a back-up, but the BoxWave is so much better that I'll purchase another as a backup and eventually throw away the Pogo Sketch all together."
1,Decent idea. Made poorly. Customer service is terrible.,"We bought this and generally liked how it worked with the iPad. Although not ultra-precise, it allowed for easier writing and for my daughter to practice her letters. Cool feel and weight. It was only used with our iPad in the manner suggested and the tip came off within 35 days of purchase. There is no way to re-assemble and this is clearly a defective one. A few days later I sent an email to Boxwave and they responded a week later telling me that this was my problem (they don't service any item sold by Amazon and Amazon doesn't allow for returns outside the 30 day window). They offered a 15% discount on future purchases. Yours will likely break and they will not stand behind it. Find another product from another company."
2,Junk,"If you think that you will get precision, forget it. The tip is bulky and difficult to use, i.e., correct amount of pressure. I have very neat hand writing and it looks nothing like it when I use this product. Also, it comes with a neat attachment so you can attach it in the headphone jack. Only one problem, if you do that it will scratch the heck out of your iPad. Not worth the money."
3,Its a geat stylus,Good heft (weight) feels nice to use but needed to be longerto simulate real pen comfort. Hasnt rusted or rotted so productreliability and quality top of line!
5,good quality,It works great on the iPad2. I also use it to draw with the app Paperdesk. Good quality product as if I paid a lot more for it.
3,Fibermesh wears out easily,"I bought two of these and one of them has already worn out in just 1 week.Many people who write reviews for this just try it for the first day and they love the pen, thus giving 5 star rating. However this is not true after 1 weeks of use.Apart from that it was a great pen!I have used adonit and bamboo as well and would recommend bamboo."
4,Great design but the stylus needs to be longer,"The overall design of the stylus is great and it has good accuracy. I especially like the attachment feature for the iPad using the earphone connector. The one thing that disappoints me is the length of the device. It is a litte under 4 and i/2 inches long. Since I use the iPad primarily for handwritten notes, I would prefer the length of the stylus to be that of a common ink pen, about 5 and i/2 inches long. If had a little more heft to it, it would feel more natural to those of us that still like to write. The specifications on the pen were not stated in the description, I believe they should be noted by the seller."
4,"BoxWave Capacitive Stylus is good, but not quite great","This is the second stylus I've purchased, the first being the Pogo brand. I like this one much better than the POGO stylus, I think it has excellent control and is very similar to writing with a pen. I would have given this 5 stars except for 2 things: 1 - it is too short. I don't have large hands, and I still think it is too short. 2 - It is too light. I think it would be more comfortable to write with if it weighed a little more."
4,Works as well as I expected,"So I read the reviews before purchasing, and will say that they are pretty much mark on. This thing works pretty well, though I do worry about losing it since it's pretty small. It also unfortunately feels kinda small in the hand. Would prefer something longer and with a more precise point - but this will do."
2,Amazon sent me the little one instead,...not sure how that happened. Had to order another one.. .haven't used it yet but will give a review when I do.
5,Love this stylus,"I love this stylus. I also have the Pogo and this one is better. The Pogo has soft ""fuzzy"" end and this Boxwave has some kind of rubber end that keeps it's shape. It's also a little thicker than the Pogo for easier grip. The head is large which makes if feel bulky but most of the apps I use have a line weight feature to address this. Enjoy!"
2,Save your money,This item has many shortcomings that are not worth describing. You can buy 3 with the same tip and length for less than $5.
1,Where is it made,"Where is it made? I searched for products made in the USA, but nothing about country of origin was mentioned. Also, why do I need to rate a product I don't know if I'd buy since I don't know if it's made in a sweatshop or not."
2,Bummer,"Same problem as many others, after a couple of months the tip fell off and it's now worthless. Unfortunate as I liked the feel and functionality but will look elsewhere for a replacement."
5,Great Stylus!,This stylus is pretty and it works great. I only wish I had a way to secure it to the ipad without it dangling. The pen-like clip does not spread out enough to clip it to my smart cover.
4,Stylus on an iPad,"I am giving this item four stars and not five simply due the way writing with a stylus on an iPad works. There are several apps that are work well with a stylus. Some have ""wrist protection"", essentially shutting off multi-touch, but I have not really found an app that allows me to use the stylus and iPad like a piece of paper. I settled on the Notability app that works well for what I need. The stylus works well with this app and I have been using it to take notes in all of my meetings."
3,Nice quality. Too small,Ok. I will state up front that I am not a fan of tiny stylus like this and POGO. Maybe I an just too big for playing with toys. Enjoyed the Targus better. Still looking for one that feels more like a tool and less like a poker.
3,Pen review,Pen works great. Anyone with arthritis will find numerous assistance to make your life more manageable
4,Another use for my iPad!,"I was not aware this product even existed until I saw an app in the App Store that called for using a stylus. I did a little research on Amazon and discovered this product. With its purchase and a 99-cent app I now have yet another amazingly useful tool for my iPad. This stylus is very well made and draws with outstanding precision. My only wish is that the tip were a little smaller to enable drawing finer lines and smaller shapes (especially for handwriting)--but that is perhaps a limitation of the technology. Otherwise, you can't go wrong with this stylus."
4,Good gadget!,I didn't like all these finger prints on my iPad. This helps a lot. I even use it for typing.
1,"Didn't like it too much, click noise","Bought the boxwave stylus from Amazon for use on my IPAD3. Comes in a neat package, with two extra pen holders, one already attached to the stylus. Stylus works fine, except that it makes a clicking noise when the metal portion near the tip of the stylus touches the glass of the ipad. Bought a Targus stylus as a replacement. That stylus does not make the clicking noise. Would not recommend this stylus."
4,Very good stylus,I bought this based on some other reviews. So far it's great. The tip can take a beating and doesn't affect it's shape. My 3 year nephew has been trying to destroy it for two days with no success! I love that the length is not too long because it fits in more pockets....but the clip at the top (to attach it to something) comes down to low and makes holding it uncomfortable sometimes. I have to turn it in my hand to get the clip out of the way. The strap which plugs the in to the earphone port on the iPad is a great feature. It keeps it from getting lost. Since the tip is plastic you can leave it plugged in and it has no affect on the sound.
3,BoxWave Stylus,"I bought this stylus to replace the Griffen sytlus I thought I had lost on the recommendation of a friend. Colors are great - not as easy to misplace but like the Griffen weight much better. What is the string thing attached to the end for, anyway?!"
5,Great stylus,This capasitive stylus maybe one of the best I have used so far. I have used the pogo branded stylues and enjoyed them quite a bit. I find that the box wave stylus feels more accurate than the pogo. I am an Artist so accuracy is very important to me. I recommend this product but I do believe it's a bit expensive.
2,Buy a Cosmonaut Stylus instead,"The problem with this stylus is that the rubber tip creates a slight friction with the screen of the ipad, which can make the writing appear bad no matter which note-taking app you use. Also, the rubber tip is hollow which does not imitate the use of a pen on paper as sometimes you have to press down on the stylus to get the screen to recognize it. Instead of this product, I would recommend buying a Studio Neat Cosmonaut stylus. It has a thicker grip and similar-sized tip, but writing with the Cosmonaut is MUCH more precise. Also, the Cosmonaut feels solid in your hand and glides across the ipad without friction - making handwriting look much, much better. Although the Cosmonaut is more expensive, I found it worth the extra $$."
1,Safety-not for small children,"Small Children should not try this toy. It's great for a lake or a bay or ocean where if you get thrown off, it is no big deal. In a pool, the likelihood of being thrown off is great when kids really get it going. So, if in a river, lake or bay or other huge body of water, where being thrown off would be part of the fun, go for it. Not for use in pool. Not even a big pool."
4,"INTERESTING BOOK, INCOMPLTE;MANY PROMINANT NAMES EXCLUDED?","I was very interested to read Mr. Spignesi book THE ITALIAN 100, however after completing it, I was left wondering why he found it justified to include Madonna and others (with questionable qualifications) and not people like Il Commandatore Enzo Ferrari. Can one talk about sports cars without naming a Ferrari? Exactly. Others notable names excluded were Barreta (handguns), Gucci (200 year old Fashion House) and others more worthy than some of those listed. This leaves me puzzled as to what criteria was used to qualify as an Italian 100. Other than this it is a very interesting book showing the many contributions of Italians in the fields of Science,Inventions, Medicine,Exporers,Arts,Sports, Philosophy etc... in the world."
4,Excellent Resource,"Mr. Cones has put together an excellent resource for indie filmmakers. My lawyer recommended his work to me, as he's already laid out the difficulties and intricacies of financing a film, and it's a lot cheaper (per hour) to read the book than to have my lawyer explain it to me. At times, it's daunting...but that's the nature of the material. Plus, you can skip to the relevant section of funding that works for your particular project."
4,"Good, if slightly tough, lock","I got two of these, one for each side of the garage door. In it's standard setup it's meant for the left side of the door (looking at it from the outside). It was easy enough to flip the internals to work for the right hand side of the door too, but it seems to stick more on that side. I'll unlock it and then have to move the handle the rest of the way manually to pull the bar out from the track - it doesn't snap open like it does in the default setup. Oh well, for the price it works well enough and is solid metal, so I feel secure with it."
4,Good Quality,"Met most expectations...had hoped that the bolt pattern would be the same as the older National lock that I was replacing. Looked the same on website but, was off by 3/8 inch from old lock. The locking tongue wouldn't quite reach the side rail slot. I had to plug old hardware holes and re-drill holes to move latch over."
5,Wow!,"This is not only a complete, clear, unified theory of the foundations of mathmatics, language, and the human mind, but a thrilling, facinating, and entertaining read. I cannot remember the last time I took this much pleasure in reading a textbook. I am not a scientist, just a person interested in what it is to be human. This incredible example of original and disciplined thinking leads the reader step by step to a view of the human mind as unique in the known universe, not simply a step on an evolutionary path, but unprecidented in its creative abilities. This is a gift that will keep giving for anyone interested in language, mathmatics or the human mind."
2,Women Beware!,"I ordered this robe for my 5'6"" 120 lb (size 6) mother. I ordered the medium based on other reviews to order a larger size due to shrinkage. The sizing may have changed since the previous reviews were submitted; this robe fit like a man's medium or woman's XL. The sleeves were approximately 12 inches too long, the belt loops were in the wrong place and it nearly wrapped around to the back. She made the comment that you could never turn on a stove with this robe on as there was so much extra material it could have touched the burner and caught on fire. If you are a woman, you might want to order two sizes smaller. Good quality; just the size was off. It will have to go back."
4,good cleaner,"while it didnt clean deeply it still did clean the cymbal gime, it makes my cymbals all shiney and awesome haha"
4,Botswana:In the Footsteps of the No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency,"This was a nice 50 minute documentary about Botswana and the author of the No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. It was definately not worth the purchase price, in fact it is the type of extra material you get on DVD's and should have been included for free on the Ladies' No 1 Detective Agency boxed set."
4,"Precious, A # 1 Lady","The NO.1 Ladies' Detective Agency, written by Alexander Mc Call Smith, is a wonderful series about people who live in Africa. This is the best series of books I have read in years! You will fall in love with the characters. Precious Ramotswe is unforgetable. After reading this book, you will think about people and Africa in a new way. I am now reading the 11th book of this series and I am sad to realize I will have to wait for Mr. Smith to write and publishes another one, before I can continue finding out what these splendid characters are up to!"
2,Boring till the last 5 minutes,"This movie was dull until about the last 5 minutes when the pace picks up a bit, its not scary or atmospheric, the mental hospital does not look old or drab enough to give it that old scary feel.I like David Caruso and think he is a great actor, but why he signed up for this I don't know.Obviously once again I missed something with all the good reviews this film got, maybe I fell asleep again !!"
1,This movie sucks,"This movie is soo slow and not worth it. I purchased it to have a scary movie night with some friends and we ended up turning it off and watching something else (Pandorum). The first 20 minutes is them not even near the building yet! My girlfriend and I tried watching it the next day and I fast-forwarded through most of it. The ending is not worth it. Only one scene was really ""scary"". I wouldn't recommended this movie to anyone. I don't know how this movie has gotten 4 stars."
3,Better than Average for a Movie you never new existed,"When the heck was this realeased? Was I sleeping???Plot starts spooky, sans MTV's ""Fear Factor"". Has a ton of potential, bulds well. Far better than most ""slashers""-- but disappointing ending.If you like chillers, rent it.If you want SCARY??????""The Changeling"" w/ G.C. Scott. Probably the best ghost movie ever made."
5,I live in the weak and the wounded.....,"Creepy, well written, wonderfully acted and intense. This is the one thing (book, music, film, etc.) that EVERYONE enjoys when I recommend it. NO ONE has ever said ""eh, it was alright""..... I'd smack then if they did! For an antagonist with no tangible screen time and few lines, Simon is extrememly unsettling and frightening. LOVE this movie."
3,"I don't get it, or do I?","I didn't have high expectations for S9. I can look at the film in two ways. If I look at it as a scary, Paranormal Activity type movie, it doesn't work, but if I look at it as a presentation of setting and the dark part of the human psyche, then it works.The cast does a good job, and the setting is excellent, reminding me of The Shining.On the ""huh?"" side, S9 leaves a lot of loose ends: a Changeling-esque empty wheelchair, cloudy backstory, plot threads that go nowhere. The title of the film also is not fully explained. Apparently it has to do with one of the workers finding a box of audio tapes that were recordings of a seriously disturbed patient who had multiple personalities. The movie leaves the viewer wondering what it was all about. I don't know whether this was the intention or not.S9 is not a horror film. It's a psychological thriller that advertises as horror."
4,session 9.....evilistic chiller......,"wicked film, plenty twists and turns,cannot say to much,Its best to watch it open for learning and untold of knoledge..."
1,A very gross and negative portrayal of the Palestinians,"This film focuses on only the Palestinians and their way of life. It portrays the Palestinian culture as ugly and full of wierd practices. It shows the Israeli soldiers as very cooperative and understanding to the Palestinians though at the same time maintaining a somewhat authoritarian air. On the contrary it shows the Palestinians as hateful and hostile to the Israelis, as if they hate them just for the sake of hating. Some of the vulgar nude scenes make the Palestinians look even more inhuman and 'different in wierd ways'."
1,is mise,"I purchased this book because it had such great reviews, but I have to say that I was disappointed with the lack of references, evidence and bibliography. I, at least, expected there to be references for the historical information."
1,replay,I was a bit disappointed with this film. I had expected something other than a replay of the series opener. Although it was updated and revised in some minor areas. I most likely would not have purchased this DVD had the advertisements had indicated what we were getting. Why? because most Stargate fans have and will see this in TV reruns.
1,What is the point...useless move on and let's see more tv movies,"What the hell is going on here, I have this episode already and it's OK not the best Stargate episode ever so why after over 10 years come back to this one. There is talk that the director was concerned about the nudity, but let's get real that lasted about 30 seconds in a 2 hour show so what is the big deal, in addition it was actually realistic as I do not think the Go'uld cared about thier slaves clothes. What I don't want is a sanitised version for the young people that they now want to attract for Stargate Universe or should I say Teenagers in space, which I am sure that thie is the real reason for the re-release. rubbish get season 1 on DVD and enjoy about 20 episodes for a few dollars more not this cash in rubbish. If they were really so concerned they would give this version away for free, but no it's all about the money"
2,Children of the Gods,This newly edited failed to live up to the claims .IT IS NOT BETTER and is in fact a poor knock off the first pilot.Watch this and watch the first SG 1 adventure and I think your will agree this is not as good.
2,Disappointed!,I am a huge Stargate fan I have watched this since it first aired on Sho time. I have all the seasons on dvd including this one. I decided to check it out even though I saw some poor reviews. I have to say that I did NOT like it. The important parts in the first movie were taken out and it left unanswered questions. I did not care about the nudity taken out because you still could understand what was happening but other scenes that were cut really took away from the film. If the idea was to get more money out of the fans then I guess they did that. I wish I never wasted my money!!
1,Anti-American!,"My 8 year old son was required to read this book by the New York State Common Core Curriculum. The illustrations in this book are of planes dropping bombs, tanks roaming the streets, people expressing their fear of dying in the war and the librarians quest to keep her books safe....and armed American soldiers as the ""bad guys"". Ultimately, the library burns to the ground (although they did remove the books and hide them). I despise the message that this story leaves with children - American soldiers are there to destroy the property and hurt the people of Basra. There is no mention of why a war took place and the images are too disturbing for some young children. Shame on Jeanette Winters for writing a book so biased against Americans."
3,Kinda weak but some fun,"The Williams collection is way better. I have Pinball Dreams & Pinball Fantasies for the SNES & even they seem better with only 4 games a piece.Some of the tables are just to old & have too many holes where you can't save the ball (I'm not a nudger) to really be fun. It is an interesting historical perspective but fun is the name of the game for me.Black Hole and a couple others make it a decent purchase AFTER you get the Williams collection and maybe even those SNES games I mentioned. If you enjoy video-pinball, I think it's worth the price.Others have mentioned the specific titles & options on the game so I'll leave it at that.Oh & Play-Boy & Xolten are not really pinball games but if you want them the codes are below:Play-Bot - PKRXolten - XTNCustom Balls = BLZ"
2,"Topic Sentances, no detail data","The writers of Cliff's AP books are usually great but here I feel they failed. Their AP Biology book was great as to resumming all learned about the subject but this one did not enumerate. It has basic people, events,and topics but no memory joggers. ;( for me I needed review of data rather than HOW to take the test."
3,A pretty decent book,"I have to say that I expected more out of this book. History is my worst subject, so when I bought this I was hoping for way more review and in-depth explanation of different topics and time periods. I also thought the practice tests were too easy; I went in thinking that I'd do great on the multiple choice, and instead found myself guessing quite a bit. However, the tips for taking the exam were great, except their advice on the DBQ format; they were so convinced that the question would be worded a certain way that they didn't include any examples of other formats! Sure enough, the DBQ was worded completly different! Overall, I'd recommend this to someone who already has a firm grasp of US history, but not someone like me who needs a much more thourough review."
2,No lo recomiendo,"Aunque cumple con su objetivo, el diseño es feo y se descompuso muy rapido, en la foto se ve mejor que en la realidad, la proxima comprare alguna otra de Victorinox que se ve mucho mejor. No lo recomiendo."
1,Snot Nose Brit Looking Down His Nose at Eveything,"While it's an interesting premise, the author takes shots at everyone and everything, again and again and again. It gets old REAL quick."
1,you already know everyone's in it for the money...,you already know everyone's in it for the money... this writer too.The author meets men and visits places you and I will never ever have the opportunity to experience. He enjoys a privileged life in the wine world all the while complaining that it's just posturing... no kidding. I agree with the author but I didn't need to read his ramblings to do so.I don't need to read wine reviews to know whether I like a wine. You don't need to read this book to know that you have your own opinion.There are too many good books out there to waste your time (or money) on this one. Try a book from Kermit Lynch or Hugh Johnson. Or better yet enjoy a personal story from Bill Bryson or Peter Mayle.
2,"Good content, but disappointing","This DVD includes 3 episodes of ""The Muppet Show."" I have always loved the Muppets, and it is good to see this great show get DVD treatment. While the content is fun and entertaining, it is minimal. There are very little special features. While the features provide a few small laughs, they don't really have much to do with the episodes themselves. And there are only three episodes. I call that [very costly]. I don't care for ""Best of"" sets in the first place (I prefer Season Sets), but they could at least included more material. They could easily fit 5 to 6 episodes on one disc, especially considering the absense of a lot of bonus features.Overall, it's an enjoyable disc but it doesn't quite satisfy me. Buy it only if you can get it for a bargain price."
1,Buyer Beware - pillows are not returnable,"I purchased this pillow because I'll try anything to relieve my neck pain. After I placed my order I realized the pillow was coming through a third party and not through Amazon. The pillow did not work for me (it actually made my neck pain worse). Unfortunately, the seller will not accept returns on pillows (supposedly because they consider it non-hygenic). They directed me to the manufacturer who will only replace the pillow with the exact same model, but will not give me a refund because I went through a third-party seller. Moral is: if you're buying any pillow on-line, double-check the return policy of the seller first!!"
2,puffy and firm,if the pillow was a little more flat and softer than it would have been perfect but it was too puffy and firm for me.
2,For a Casual Player the ending battle SUCKS,"Why have a Casual setting for this game? I made it to the last battle and could not beat it after 20 times. I play games to have fun not get frustrated. Overall the game was pretty fun, but ending battle you get 10 minutes into the fight die, then do over. Wow lot of fun. Hey developers, catch a clue, if I die 20 times in a row scale the difficulty down some. Do you think that getting super frustrated is FUN?????? Hell no, can't wait to sell this game. Oh great graphics though! Not worth keeping. I recommend a rental.. you can do the whole game in 2 days, then get stuck at the end."
3,Not Great! Not even close!,"I guess it will take a little more time for developers to figure out the PS3. This game is just another average game. The controls are very loose. When you start to turn, it is sluggish, then speeds up as you turn. Graphics are not top notch and everything seems convoluted. I agree with Valo 73's review. For it to be billed as a ""GREAT"" game is just another marketing issue. Let us get more students in the field for developing games for the PS3's ""guts"". Only GPA's of 3.2 or above need apply! NOTE: I must admit that I rushed to judgment with this post years ago! It is one of my favorite games! I am just glad that they added the toggling of the crouch button in Killzone 3! Take care!"
4,not a long review,"I'm just doing a quick review, nothing big. This game is flat-out excellent in regards to gameplay and graphics. The solo is fun and the cut scenes are beautiful. I like how the AI actually acts human, as in, they avoid bullets as people would prefer to do. The online is a bit different for me. If you're looking for something like COD this is going to be slower, but then again, that is to make it more realistic. It's not bad - just different. It is worth the buy."
4,"Fun game, great visuals, somewhat clunky controls!","This game is great. It throws you in the midst of war and never gives you a moment of peace. Its go go go time! Its a lot of fun and visually the most beautiful game i have ever seen. The only downfall is that it has somewhat clunky and slow controlling. This makes sense because of all armor and various other heavy items you carry around, but I would have hoped it would control more like Battlefield bad company or CoD 4 for multiplayer. Overall, i would highly recommend the game to any fan of FPS, but just keep in mind there will be a slight learning curve with the controlling. But within, 45 min, you'll be an old pro."
2,i want my money back,"this game is an atrocity. first let me start with the single player... too linear, short, controls are clumsy and make it hard to aim, and its basically the same throughout the entire game. the multiplayer was fun for about 30 minutes until i realized if you have a rocket launcher...you win. the controls make multiplayer an angry experience. the levels are crappy and make it an all out chaotic event, which is good if there is a certain amount of control. there should be no teams because you cant tell who is who. the game should be 30 dollars. the graphics are pretty though. not a very good rent definitely not a good buy. spend your money on a good game like metal gear solid or little big planet"
1,Worst game ever,This is the worst killzone game I've ever play it so buggy it makes it hard to play great job sony
3,good but short,"Pros: Lots of action, good graphics, addictiveCons: Too short (less than 10hrs of gameplay), stupid last battle where they tried to make it unbelievably difficult seemingly just to extend the game a bit"
5,Nice!!,"the single player was action packed and those AIs were somewhat smart, always hiding and moving. the multi player had a lot of different objectives that always end up in chaos with 32 players. and that was fun."
2,Try before you buy.,"WOW-I got it, I got it!!!;-)))I put the disk into my PS3, installed the latest software, watched the great intro. I was hyped. And then, I started playing. Oh man did I get HEATED. It is like playing in slow mode. I am so use to playing COD4, playing KZ2 doesn't even compare to its speed. You move around as if you are carrying heavy armor on you. What a let down. They should of put more resources in the game play than in video effects.Save some money and rent before you buy."
1,SON I AM DISAPPOINT,"I heard all the hype about this game and finally decided to get it.Sure the graphics are great but the gameplay is no good.The single player is very generic, and the online is just not as good as COD4.Worth a rental but not a purchase."
4,Killzone 2 Campaign vs. Online,"This is possibly the most intense Campaign first person shooter i have ever experienced on any system, The enemy AI is real good and you have to have patience to take them down.Great multiplayer online but i wish there was a hardcore version, 1 shot to kill, like COD4, that is my only critique. it also can get a little too intense and chaotic, which eliminates the tactical aspect real quick.All in all i'd give it 4.5 out of 5.beatiful graphics and storyline"
4,Older game but still very enjoyable,"I owned this game and then I got rid of it. After I heard that Killzone 3 was coming out, I had an urge to play this game again. So I ordered it and I remembered why I loved it before. I enjoy the Killzone games. The graphics are a good quality and it is a fun game! I typically don't like to own over 1 online game at a time but I broke my rule and got Killzone again!"
3,Over rated,"Wow, for all the hype this game got, it is fairly disappointing. I Have played many better first person shooters. The campaign is repetitive and the multiplayer is almost 30 minutes a match! I've played better, I've played worse. It plays like a more refined call of duty but it's pretty much the same old first person shooter."
5,Believe the hype.,"Do not listen to all the one star reviews because this game is astonishing! There is nothing wrong with the controls. It just goes for a more realistic style and it shows in this game. The graphics are the best yet on any console system. Seriously, this is an early contender for 'Game of the Year'.Graphics 10Sound 10Controls 10Overall 10"
1,Don't buy this game until...,"If you are looking for an online FPS game, keep looking. This game has potential, but the controls are so bad that you'll end up sending it back or letting it gather dust.This is frustrating because the game looks pretty good, and has a number of interesting features, but all is for nothing with control."
3,Good single player terrible multiplayer,Pretty much the same as others are saying. I thought the single player was great. Controls have to be set to default 2 to play the rest are garbage. Graphics are unbelievable. Multiplayer is a pure waste of time. Played single player through 2 times and now its time to trade it in for something else. In No Way dose this compare with COD 4 or COD 5 not even in the same league.
1,First time motivated to post review.,"This game will be great for teenagers. But if you are looking for a game that goes beyond great graphics, then this is NOT the game for you.Almost no story to follow.Not much purpose for any of the mission.Very much arcade like.AI is terrible.I returned this."
5,Lag-Free Online Gaming at last,"Killzone 2 sets the standard of graphics in a video game very high. This is one of the most beautiful games ever created, outstanding particle effects, great lighting and impressive character models. The controls are good, they take some time to get used to but for me they are fine (and I have played a lot of FPS). The replay value is very high since the online game (Warzone) of Killzone is where this game shines even more delivering outstanding gameplay, great customization and lag-free gaming. The only flaw to me is that the game suffers sometimes of slowdown when it's loading the map in the single player campaign and sometimes this can get a bit annoying. Other than that the game is great and it deserves every good review it has received."
5,el mejor juego de shooting de todos los tiempos,"el mejor juego d todos los tiempos , he sido un fanatico de COD ,pero este juego en definitiva es mejor.tienen que tenerlo en su coleccion de juegos."
4,Fun at first,"While the game lasts, it pretty fun. I am one of the few people who didnt stop playing because of the controls but for another reason.The multiplayer is fun but it gets old quickly. Whether its the lack of variety in weapons or the complete lack of teamwork in most games, the game fell short for me.Pros:1. Obviously the great graphics.2. Good shooting mechanics (as long as you get used to the controls- does not take as long as people say)3. Multiplayer is fairly good.Cons:1. Campaign is not that great. No memorable characters and fairly bad script.2. Lack of co-op or splitscreen. Would of been fun to play with a friend.You may have a different, better experience than I did. While it lasted, Killzone 2 was a great game for me. That sadly did not last long, however, and I ended up not wanting to put the disc in and play."
2,Flow and Flaw,"The ""flow"" in the book looks to be good. But the flaw is in explaining the examples. No explanation has been given for some important (atleast for me) examples! C shell examples are rarely discussed. The book says ""It helps you to develop Bourne, C, or Korn Shell mastery step-by-step, whether you're a beginner or a ...."", which I feel is not true."
1,Terrible,"If you want a book on unix shell programming...save your money and don't buy this one. The examples are faulty. Emailed the author regarding a question and up till now, he has not replied. You will spent a lot of time scratching the head because of how confusing the whole book is...tried to cover all 3 shells but in the end, gotten confused over them."
1,Don't even waste time to look at the cover!,"This is the WORST textbook I've ever seen. I had wasted lots of time to read it but learn nothing from it. I don't want to waste time to comment too much. Just to tell those of U who are reading this comment - don't buy it! Save money, save trees for another book."
2,meh.,It is only floating if you detach the base. And the original image was not a good representation. The pic I see now is fairly accurate. No more convincing than any typical plastic plant.
1,You gotta be very paranoid to believe this,"I thought this book would give insight into how folks group up with bullies to lie and protect the bullies or how relational aggression was used in group situations. It surely did not read that way to me. It made Mobbing a group activity where everyone was out to get you, no matter where you turned THEY were there spying on you, mocking you, video recording your every move, CIA radar beams directed at you controlling your every thought and action. No, it did not meet my expectations."
5,Excellent and important book,"Anytime you name something you begin to grasp it with more power. The authors have given us the gift of naming a pernicious process called ""Mobbing."" They define Mobbing as 'group bullying.' Sometimes obvious and sometimes subtly masked by the bullies power it consistently has a negative impact on everyone adjacent. Reading this book brought back numerous personal memories of the intimidating, humiliating, isolating sorts of tactics that mobbing can take in the workplace. The more I thought about it the more I realized that mobbing is much more common than I had first thought. This is a crucial read for those who have been ""mobbed"" in the workplace, and also vital for employers to read to create a workplace that is safe from the tragedies of mobbing. The book not only outlines the process of mobbing it goes many steps further to give people ways to respond and heal. This is an excellent ground-breaking book. Highly recommended."
5,movie,"I really liked this movie haven't watched before, nice to know how they met and became friends. good price. good buy."
2,A poor quality work redeemed by its topic,"This book is a PhD written about another man's PhD thesis. Otto Weininger's thesis is original and interesting, whether you agree with its theories or not. This one has a sneering tone, and has little originality. I gave it two stars because the topic Sengoopta picked is good."
1,Disappointing,"I have been an ELP fan since the beginning. I have seen them countless times in concert over the past 40 years. I was disappointed in this DVD. Keith Emerson's performance was rushed and sloppy. He did not have his full battery of keyboards, and bashing his Hammond organ in the encore was too corny. Greg Lake's voice was not what it used to be. Aside from playing acoustic guitar on ""From the Beginning"" and ""Lucky Man"" he only played bass. Carl Palmer's performance was excellent, however his drum kit was a bit down-sized as well. The biggest disappointment for me was they did not include ""Pirates"" in this performance. The 40th anniversary DVD from 2010 is about the same as this one, however Lake's voice is a bit stronger in spite of the 40-50 lbs he gained since 1997. And Mr. Palmer is sporting a belly too, and also no ""Pirates"". If you absolutely have to have an ELP performance DVD, I would recommend the 40th anniversary DVD over the Montreaux '97."
4,Bourdon's biography of Warhol,"This is a very interesting and useful overview of Warhol's life, but it's a little light. For instance, Andy was Czech, not Polish....and he wasn't Catholic, he was Orthodox. He also neglected to mention that Andy's father died from contracting hepatitis on a worksite...Andy's work ethic is a large part of his persona, and one can understand him much better knowing these details. Bourdon never seems to minutely examine or analyze, or draw on various sources to synthesize an understanding of the man. See Ken Burn's documentary for a more personal understanding.One biography I read delved so deep as to describe Julia's loss of her first child, a daughter, due to hardships suffered after her husband went to America to find work. I believe I read that she was forced to work in the fields, leaving the ill child alone in the house. She returned to find the baby had died. I think such dramatic information is pivotal to understanding Andy's parents and childhood."
2,Poor Quality,"I bought this camera for my 7 year old. We were very disappointed. The pictures all come out dark unless they are taken in very bright light, mostly outside. My other daughter recently got another digital camera by Digital Concepts. It was much cheaper and much better quality."
1,Not worth the money,"The camera looks neat but isn't very functional. My 5 year old still wanted a real camera. Plus, we had it just over a month and it stopped working (warranty only goes 30 days). Save the money and buy a better camera."
2,TV Noir: Plastic Pastiche.,"Some woman director likes noir glamour and decides to jam it down your throat in this slick plod that plays like a skid row Cotton Club. The orchestra has nice arrangements of lackluster muzak, and virtually all the characters are pretty, and pretty annoying, especially the groovy narrator, who is more depressing than the film itself."
4,A Major Soviet Star,"I first saw her perform in early 1977, when my parents took me to her concert, though I am not sure why they did it. I remember little of that event, but now that I cast my view over the whole span of Pugacheva's career, I think her earlier stuff was the best. R. Pauls wrote good songs for Pugacheva and she sang them very well when she was young."
1,"Lip-Synching, Over-Glorified, Washed-up, Russian Pop Diva","An album by a woman whose talent dried up long ago showcases unoriginal, kitchy pop melodies (which she doesn't even bother to really sing in concert or TV appearances). The best example of the worst pop music of Russia. The music, compared to other modern popular Russian artists, is simple, synthesized and corny. Aside from a few old favorites (Million Allykh Ros), most of her later pieces were hastily composed props in one of her many staged ""comebacks"". For some more original popular Russian music try looking for some of the following groups/albums: Bravo/Moskovski Beat (50's style swing-Jazz) DDT/Aktrisa Vesnya (Rock--with a real Russian feel) Kvartal/Khod Dlya Postoronnikh--Modern Jazz/Pop"
4,Relaxing,"A little bulky, but it creates a very relaxing experience. While I wish it would get a little hotter, the steady warmth is nice and it holds the temperature for a good twenty minutes. I regularly fall asleep while wearing it.I think that the magnets make this a little more effective than it would be otherwise since it's a dry heat product (moist heat is better). My physical therapist says that although it sounds ridiculous, magnets reduce inflammation even better than ice. Since I need heat to unblock glands in my eyes, and I need to reduce inflammation in my eyes related to an autoimmune condition, this is a good product for me. So far, I'm pretty happy with it."
1,Outdated!! - perl/tk is not even used anymore,"The only reason you would want to buy this book is if you want to modify an existing perl/tk program. Even then, I do not recommend buying it.Perl/tk is discontinued!!!!!! ActivePerl now uses the package tkx to bridge tk and perl. Although similar to perl/tk, it has many new updates not included in this book. Plus, the syntax is new.Here is a good explanation as why tkx is now used:""Because Perl/Tk extricated Tcl from Tk, it took considerable effort to track newer Tk releases, and so has waned in modern years. The recommended Tk binding for Perl now is the ""Tkx"" module, a much smaller layer that provides a direct bridge to the Tcl API that Tk exposes."" -tkdocs dot com"
3,it's alright,"i love the pillows and thats why i got this cd,but there are a few ""songs"" with them just speaking japanese.haha i guess i should have looked it up,but it still is a good cd."
4,One Of The Better Ones,"While this book didn't answer all of my questions, it did go a long way toward assisting me in understanding what in the h*ll is going on with my body and mind. Dr Corio's attitude is straightforward; her advice seems logical - and dovetails with everything else I've been reading. Plus, she dishes out a goodly amount of common sense with her suggestions about supplements, vitamins, and minerals.One caveat: This book was published before HRT was recognized as an unacceptable therapy for menopausal symptoms. Dr Corio, however, favors natural remedies over HRT in most cases, something that's comforting in a book published in 2000.I heartily recommend this as an addition to any woman's wellness library."
5,A copy for everyone in the family,"I received this as a Chanukah gift last month. Honestly, I haven't had this must fun with software for some time! This software does it all: cards, labels, envelopes, photo cards, and so much more! I even went out and purchased a high quality printer to use with this program.I really have had a positive experience with this. Shortly after downloading it to my computer I called the company. Their Support Dept. answered every question I asked! They even gave me a few pointers on using the program!I like this software so much, I just bought one for my sister and my aunt!"
4,Love My Glasses,I wear my Sea Striker Sunglasses daily. They improve my vision when fishing.Totally removes any glare from the water surface.
2,For small face,"This sunglasses look good but they are very small. If you have a large face do not buy them, they will be just too small even for average faces."
4,The Funniest Anime Out There!,"The cover, I suppose, was mainly designed to boost sales from college boys and dirty old men. ::shrug:: But what's inside is a truly funny little peice of anime dessert. The main character, Carrot, is obsessive about women but endearing, and all the characters except for maybe, Gateau, are surprisingly complex. Check it out for a few good chuckles. :-)"
4,Nice so far,"For the everyday and average cook, this is a nice set. They cook evenly and wash and dry quickly. We do not regret our purchase.Misc. notes: With a gas stove the long handle does not get hot, but the short handle does. The outside of some of our pans have gotten scratched already (probably from the handles of other pans in our cabinet), and the top rim on the pans is a nonstick finish so that also can get scratched."
4,"Vivid, enchanting fantasy","Yes, this book, and its predecessor Arcady, are at times difficult to read, but the vivid description and wonderful characterisation make it well worth the effort. I have just finished this novel after possessing a copy for years. These novels are truly unique - although the images are familiar, as from dreams or childhood memories of exploring ruined country estates, coming across the statue of a fallen sphinx, covered in moss...P.S. Buy the UK paperback edition with the wonderful cover by Mick van Houten"
